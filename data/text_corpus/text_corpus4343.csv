s 1 introduction to limit the consequences of climate change society must dramatically reduce co2 emissions which are a major driver of climate change anderson and bows 2011 with its large share of worldwide transport shipping accounts for approximately 3 of global co2 emissions the imo set a goal to halve the emissions of the world s fleet by 2050 compared to the 2008 level o and 2018 online avai 2018 at the same time forecasts show a doubling of the transport needs by 2050 which has caused the world s shipping fleet to grow cutting the emissions of a growing fleet requires drastic measures and savings for each ship far exceeding the 50 decrease targeted for the entire fleet such a decrease in emissions cannot be achieved with conventional fuels combustion engines and ship designs alternative and complementary propulsion systems have become a focus of research in recent years one such alternative is wind assisted propulsion using e g flettner rotors as shown for a tanker in fig 1 although the implementation of wind assisted propulsion in shipping is not without challenges the large potential savings make it a viable solution concerning the environment and the economy rehmatulla et al 2017 numerous studies have focused on the economics and general fuel savings of such systems ballnii et al 2017 talluri et al 2018 tillig and ringsberg 2018 van der kolk et al 2019a showing that wind assisted propulsion can significantly lower fuel consumption and emissions however these studies have also shown that the economics highly depend on wind conditions ship types and shipping routes although several different wind propulsion technologies have been assessed the most realistic options seem to be fixed wing sails or variants combinations of wing sails with or without flaps rotor sails and kites traut et al 2014 lu and ringsberg 2019 in traut et al 2014 the propulsive power contribution of a single flettner rotor is compared with the power contribution from a kite showing that the average savings with the single flettner rotor are higher than with the kite in viola et al 2015 wing sails with flaps and twist control were applied to a tanker and the results showed considerable power contributions that could save fuel the general characteristics of flettner rotors have been widely studied by both cfd and model tests li et al 2012 bordogna et al 2019 the potential savings of flettner rotors applied to ships were shown in searcy 2017 for domestic shipping in tillig and ringsberg 2018 for a baltic sea route in tillig et al 2019 for an atlantic triangular route and in bentin et al 2016 for a trans atlantic route all these studies show large potential savings and economic feasibility for flettner rotors while considering the installation and maintenance costs depending on the route the ship type and the number of rotors fuel savings approaching 40 have been reported with such potential savings and the ease of operation flettner rotors are one of the most promising propulsion alternatives for lowering shipping emissions unlike the thrust from a propeller the total force of a sail does not act along a ship s longitudinal axis all sails produce a lift force perpendicular to the inflow and a drag force parallel to the inflow these lift and drag forces can be transformed into a thrust in the ship s longitudinal direction and a side force perpendicular to the ship the side forces are much larger than the wind loads that are typically experienced by ships and must be compensated by a drift angle of the hull and a rudder angle both of which create added resistance to accurately predict the savings from wind assisted propulsion it is thus crucial to perform a four degrees of freedom 4 dof analysis of the ship i e predict the yaw and heel moments thrust and drift of the ship for the performance prediction of the ship it is crucial to predict the added resistance from the rudder which must compensate the yaw moment induced by the sails and the added resistance due to drift which appear due to the large side forces from the sails additionally it is important to include the roll of the ship since especially slender ships can experience large heel angles due to the sails a heel angle also introduces yaw moments from the sails due to the transversal shift of the thrust force and reduces the sail forces due to the reduced projected sail area the importance of a systems perspective including interaction effects in between the sails and between the sails and the hull i e rudder angle and drift is discussed in viola et al 2015 van der kolk et al 2019b in yacht sailing models considering the sail and hydrodynamic forces that predict the performance of yachts are called velocity prediction programs vpps and they are widely used to compare and predict the performance of sailing yachts in shipping such vpps are not yet common an approach towards a vpp was presented in tillig and ringsberg 2018 van der kolk et al 2019a viola et al 2015 however the main challenges remain quantifying the aerodynamic interaction and the hydrodynamics of ships sailing at a drift angle in viola et al 2015 lee et al 2016 the aerodynamic interaction effects were evaluated using time consuming cfd computations while the model in van der kolk et al 2019a was based on model tests typically the hydrodynamics of a hull are based on empirical methods from maneuvering research as in tillig and ringsberg 2018 viola et al 2015 or on cfd or model test results using standard series hulls van der kolk et al 2019b van der kolk 2016 this study presents the continued development of a ship energy system model called shipclean which was presented in tillig and ringsberg 2018 the new developments relate to modules in the shipclean model which have been added to include the aerodynamic interaction effects and better represent the hydrodynamics of a ship sailing at a drift angle additionally a novel approach to individually optimize the rpm of each flettner rotor in an array installed on a ship is presented the study focuses on the application of flettner rotors because of their great potential for fuel savings and ease of operation see the former references above to predict the feasibility and the potential savings of flettner rotors on a large amount of different ships on different routes and to be able to perform optimizations of flettner rotors on a ship a simulation model must i be generic i e require only a very limited amount of information about the ship and ii require low computational efforts with these requirements the employed methods must rely on empirical or analytical formulations that together form a methodology and simulation model with known and acceptable prediction accuracy cfd computations cannot be used for this purpose due to their computational effort and model tests especially for the rotors cannot cover all possible arrangements and conditions for flettner rotors on a ship however the shipclean model satisfies the above requirements it is a simulation model specifically developed to provide accurate performance predictions with very limited input data with short computational time thus being applicable to extensive studies as described above the article is divided into three main parts in section 2 the shipclean model is described the theory of aerodynamic interaction and hydrodynamic lift and drag as well as the implementation in shipclean are discussed in section 3 section 4 discusses the operation retrofitting and new design of wind assisted propelled ships using examples with a tanker on a pacific ocean route and a roro on a baltic sea route including the presentation of the rpm control of the rotors a qualitative discussion of uncertainties of the predictions of the fuel savings is presented in section 4 5 followed by the conclusions of the study in section 5 2 the shipclean model the shipclean model is a ship performance prediction model based on analytical and empirical methods as well as on propeller and hull standard series programmed in matlab mathworks 2020 the model is developed following a modularized approach i e each part of the model is represented by a module which can easily be replaced or new modules can be added all parts of the model are described in detail in tillig and ringsberg 2018 and tillig et al 2017 in tillig et al 2018 uncertainties in the prediction are analyzed and quantified an overview of the model is shown in fig 2 the focus of the model development was that predictions should be available without numerous input data e g the hull form and exact geometry of the ship shall not be necessary for a performance prediction thus the data needed for a power prediction are the main dimensions loa b t δ the design speed the ship type and the propeller rpm the remaining dimensions such as the lpp depth and superstructure dimensions are estimated by the model using empirical formulas the lpp is estimated based on empirical bulb lengths and lengths of the ship aft of ap the height of the superstructure is based on estimations of the number decks and the length is depending on the size and type of the ship as an example pctc and ferries are assumed to have superstructure lengths equal to their lpp tankers are assumed to have a superstructure length of 1 7th of their lpp details about the estimation of the ship dimensions are presented in tillig 2017 to predict the performance in real operation conditions the true wind speed and angle twa tws currents and water temperature must be specified wave heights and directions can be specified or evaluated to match the wind speed a specified fetch and the wind direction in tillig and ringsberg 2018 the shipclean model was extended compared to tillig et al 2017 2018 to handle 4 degrees of freedom 4 dof which was proven to be crucial for accurately predicting the performance of wind assisted propelled ships a detailed description of forces and moments acting on a wind assisted propelled ship was presented in tillig and ringsberg 2018 the focus when analyzing wind assisted propulsion is on accurately predicting the delivered thrust of the sails and the hydrodynamic compensation of the side forces created by the sails the forces and moments on a wind assisted ship can be divided into two groups i aerodynamic forces and moments i e wind loads on the hull and superstructure as well as the sail forces and the resulting moments and ii hydrodynamic forces and moments i e drag and lift forces on the hull as well as rudder drag and lift forces and the resulting moments the resistance of the hull is divided into calm water resistance added resistance due to shallow water added resistance due to waves added resistance from fouling added resistance from ice and added resistance due to drift additionally the course and speed over ground are corrected for influences from ocean currents a complete description of the employed methods can be found in tillig and ringsberg 2018 tillig et al 2017 2018 since only the steady state condition is evaluated in shipclean the sum of all forces and moments in each of the 4 dofs must be zero see tillig and ringsberg 2018 for a complete description of the 4 dof method in shipclean 1 f x f y n k 0 in addition to the surge drift and yaw must be respected due to the high side forces and potentially high yaw moments that wind assisted propulsion introduces the consideration of the roll of the ship is crucial since heel angles can become large for slender ships with large sail areas and thus sail forces must be limited additionally the projected area of the sails is reduced due to the heel angle reducing the sail forces and the thrust force from the sails are shifted transversely which causes a yaw moment since the forces and moments in the different directions are dependent on each other e g the rudder drag is dependent on the propeller thrust the drift angle and the rudder side force equation 1 can only be solved iteratively for a given sail force e g given rpms of the installed flettner rotors the rudder angle drift angle heel angle and propeller thrust are iterated to achieve the force and moment balance the starting point of the iteration is found by solving equation 1 without the dependencies between forces and moments of different directions i e the rudder forces are assumed independent of the propeller thrust and the resistance and sail forces independent of the heel and drift angles additionally a novel rpm control iterates the rpm of each single rotor to minimize the required propeller thrust the optimization is performed by stepwise reducing the rpm of selected rotors from the optimal rpm for the wind angle and speed the selection of the rotor to reduce in power is performed using a scoring system see section 4 2 1 for details since the shipclean model is based solely on empirical analytical and interpolation methods the computational time is significantly shorter than for models based on cfd the evaluation of one weather condition for one target speed including the hydro and aerodynamic interaction see section 3 reefing section 4 2 and involuntary speed loss takes approximately 10 s on a standard desktop pc without sails this computational time reduces to less than 1 s the shipclean model was verified against a model test with different ship types in tillig et al 2018 and full scale measurements of a cruise ferry with a flettner rotor installed in norsepower 2019a the results presented in tillig et al 2018 norsepower 2019a show very good agreement between the performance prediction using shipclean and the model and full scale measurements 2 1 the flettner rotor model in shipclean the force generated by a flettner rotor on board a ship is divided into a lift force l acting perpendicular to the local apparent wind direction and a drag force d acting in line with the local wind direction with the local apparent wind direction the lift and drag forces can be converted into thrust t and side s forces as expressed in equations 2 and 3 2 t d cos a w a l sin a w a 3 s d sin a w a l cos a w a all forces are expressed using force coefficients as defined by equation 4 4 c i i 0 5 ρ a a w s 2 i l d t s since the flettner rotors are rotated using electric motors the power consumption must be respected in the performance prediction the power consumption is expressed using a power coefficient cp as defined by equation 5 5 c p p r o t o r 0 5 ρ a a w s 3 the lift and drag force coefficients of a flettner rotor depend on the spin ratio the aspect ratio of the rotor and the size of the disc at the top the spin ratio is defined as the ratio between the local wind speed u in equation 6 and the rotor s tangential speed at the surface 6 s r v t u ω r r u in shipclean the lift and drag coefficients are valid for rotors with an aspect ratio of ar 6 and with a disc diameter twice the rotor s diameter the coefficients are based on the results in li et al 2012 but corrected to better match the full scale measurements see section 3 4 c l 0 0046 sr 5 0 1145 sr 4 0

section 3 the forces and power consumption are analyzed for several rotational speeds at different heights the initial rotational speed for one rotor is defined as the condition with the maximal net power for the rotor itself pnetrotor considering the number of heights n the net power can be calculated by p n e t r o t o r s r p t s r p r o t o r s r i 1 n c t h s r ρ a i r 2 a r o t o r n a w s

angle the resistance and the rudder angle reefing might be applied in the form of a reduced spin ratio to one or several rotors reefing and general operation of the rotors are described in section 4 3 aero and hydrodynamic interaction effects to improve the methods presented in tillig and ringsberg 2018 for wind assisted propulsion the following sections focus on the interaction effects between sails the superstructure and the hull of wind assisted ships new improved methods for the prediction of the sail thrust and side force as well as for the lift and drag generated by a ship sailing at a drift angle are developed and presented 3 1 coordinate systems two coordinate systems are introduced one fixed to the ship hull x y z and one flow oriented fixed to the course through water x y z note that the course and speed corrections for ocean currents are performed prior to the analysis presented in this work i e twa tws and u are corrected for the influence of the ocean current the coordinate systems with the definition of the drift and rudder angles are shown in fig 3 the twa and the wave encounter angle are defined counterclockwise off the bow i e an angle of zero degrees represents head wind waves the force and moment balance according to equation 1 is done in the flow oriented main coordinate system x y z therefore forces from the ship fixed coordinate system must be transferred to the main system 11 f x f x c o s β f y s i n β 12 f y f y c o s β f x s i n β 13 f z f z 3 2 wind speed gradient the wind speed gradient describes the horizontal distribution of the mean wind speed i e the interaction of the wind and the earth s surface or a ship s deck friction between the moving air and the earth s surface causes the wind speed to be lower the closer it is towards the earth causing a boundary layer with characteristic wind speed profiles the boundary layer thickness and shape are mainly influenced by the turbulence in the air and the shape roughness of the surface the wind speed gradient can be described by kaltschmitt et al 2007 14 t w s h t w s 10 h h 10 α where tws10 is the wind speed at a height of 10 m h10 and α is the hellmann coefficient which is dependent on the surface of the earth and the turbulence of the wind at the point of interest this wind speed gradient causes a shear of the apparent wind angle over the height of a sail on board a ship in this study two conditions are of interest i the wind above the ocean surface which is low in turbulence and stable due to the long fetch and ii the wind above the ship s deck which due to the short fetch is unstable according to garzon and figueroa 2017 the hellmann coefficient for stable air above the open water surface and unstable air above human inhabited areas is 0 27 which is chosen here for both abovementioned conditions the apparent wind speed and angles above the ship s deck are estimated in two steps first the apparent wind angle and apparent wind speed at 10 m height above the sea surface are computed using the true wind speed gradient over the sea surface as well as the true wind angle the ship s speed and drift angle second the apparent wind speed profile above the ship s deck is estimated using equation 14 with the assumption that the wind speed at 10 m above the deck is equivalent to the wind speed at the corresponding height i e deck height 10 m above the sea surface fig 4 shows the apparent wind angles and speeds at different heights of a rotor sail both the wind angle and the wind speed highly depend on the height above the deck for a 30 m rotor sail the speed is 60 higher at the top compared to the bottom while the wind angle is 3 larger these numbers show the importance of twist control of sails that require a certain angle of attack for specified wind speeds such as wing sails it must be noted that these angles are without the wind shear in the true wind that can be present and increase the differences flettner rotors are not sensitive to the angle of attack however the rpm of the rotors must be optimized considering the wind speed and angle distributions since the thrust and side forces of the rotor depend on the local wind angle for this reason the forces power consumption and moments of the sails are evaluated for several different rpms at each considered height the maximum of the sum of the net power at each height see equation 10 i e the thrust power minus the consumed power specifies the optimal rpm for the actual condition the optimal rpms might be reduced later in the energy balance calculation in shipclean due to the need to reduce the sail forces as described in section 4 1 and 4 2 3 3 sail sail interaction the influence of sails on the flow field across a ship s deck can be divided into two parts i a potential part i e a circulation that is induced into the flow field and ii a viscous part i e a wake and turbulence caused by flow separation and free vortices the induced circulation i e the potential flow influence results in a change in local wind speeds and directions across the ship and thus different wind conditions for each sail a schematic presentation of the potential flow around a rotating cylinder is presented in fig 5 including the lift force l drag force d tangential speed vt rotational speed ω and circulation г in garzon and figueroa 2017 the potential flow interaction effects are solved analytically for an array of flettner rotors assuming a pure horizontal flow in the x y plane and defining the two boundary conditions as i the induced velocity at infinity is 0 and ii the induced speed at the rotor surface is equal to the tangential speed vt the navier stokes equation can be simplified to an analytical solution of the flow pattern created by a single rotor garzon and figueroa 2017 the vx in the x direction and vy in the y direction components of the induced flows from the rotating cylinders can be computed by garzon and figueroa 2017 with rr as the radius of the rotor and vt the induced velocity due to the circulation 15 v x x y v t r r x 2 y 2 cos arctan y x 16 v y x y v t r r x 2 y 2 sin arctan y x in equations 15 and 16 the rotor is assumed to be placed in the origin of the coordinate system since the solution is linear the solution of an array of rotors is represented by the sum of the induced flow from each single rotor given that the offsets from the coordinate center are considered for each rotor the induced velocity at the rotor radius can be computed using the circulation г which according to the biot sawert s law can be expressed by houghton et al 2017 17 γ 2 π r r v t the circulation г can be evaluated using known lift coefficients e g from model tests and the kutta joukowsky theorem abbot and von doenhoff 1959 for the lift per unit span l with u as the inflow velocity 18 l ρ u γ 19 l c l ρ 2 u 2 c this method can be used for any type of sail for sails such as flettner rotors a more accurate relation between the lift coefficient and the circulation is given in swanson 1961 as 20 c l 1 r r r c γ r r u sin γ 2 π r r r c γ r r u 2 here the term r r r c stands for the relation between the radius of the rotor rr and the distance to the external vortex rc and γ describes the location of the external vortex swanson 1961 unfortunately r r r c and γ cannot be found analytically in swanson 1961 for spin ratios between 1 and 4 good agreement with the model test results was obtained with r r r c 0 25 and γ 210 in fig 6 a the angular speed of a flettner rotor with 5 m diameter and 30 m height is compared to the angular speed of the fluid computed from the circulation according to equation 20 additionally in fig 6b the angular speed computed from the circulation according to equation 20 is compared to the angular speed according to equation 18 the circulation reaches a maximum at a spin ratio of approximately 4 fig 6a shows that the angular speed computed from equation 20 is slightly higher than the speed computed from equation 18 since equation 20 proposed in swanson 1961 is specifically for flettner rotors it is used in this study for other sail types such as wing sails the formulation in equations 18 and 19 can be used to predict the interactions according to equations 15 and 16 equations 15 20 can be solved analytically to calculate the flow field in an array of flettner rotors however since the optimal rpm of a rotor depends on the local wind speed and angle and the induced velocities depend on the rotor s rpm an iteration is required to achieve the flow field respecting the optimal rpm of each rotor note that in this stage the optimal rpm is calculated without respecting the drift and rudder forces which are first included in the rpm optimization see section 4 1 1 to visualize the interaction effects a tanker with 4 flettner rotors 5 m in diameter and 30 m high is studied at a ship speed vs of 12 kn and a tws of 12 m s the rotors are arranged in a rectangular array with a longitudinal distance of 61 2 m and a transverse distance of 25 8 m see fig 7 the induced flow field according to equations 15 and 16 is shown for a twa of 65 awa 45 aws 16 5 m s additionally the wind angles and wind speeds experienced by each of the rotors are shown both the wind angle and the wind speed experienced by each rotor are highly influenced by the presence of the other rotors thus the thrust and side force coefficients and optimal rpm must be evaluated respecting the local wind speed and angle naturally the pattern of the wind angles and wind speeds for each rotor correspond to those experienced by sail boats on different positions in a fleet race bethwaite 2013 the viscous interactions are comprised of a wake i e areas of low wind speed due to flow separation and free vortices created by the rotors in bordogna et al 2020 it is shown from flow measurements in model tests that the wake behind a cylinder diminishes as it spins this indicates that there should not be any wakes behind flettner rotors however in e g bethwaite 2013 it is presented that sail boats further downwind in a fleet of racing sail boats experience lower wind speeds and high turbulence in the air since every sail creates tip vortices depending on the generated lift it is most likely that such vortices influence the air flow to the sails further downwind in the horizontal plane tip vortices are following the potential streamlines however the vertical path i e the height of the vortices and the diameter are more difficult to predict without flow measurements or cfd computations in shipclean the focus is on fast predictions of the performance of wind assisted ships without requiring detailed information to e g enable easy weather routing thus cfd computations cannot be used but eventual performance penalties due to turbulent air or free vortices must be captured to reduce the performance of sails downwind of another sail the wind speed is reduced in an area with a width of the chord length or diameter for flettner rotors along the potential streamlines downwind of a sail in shipclean a standard wind speed reduction of 5 compared to the local wind speed including the potential influences is applied a visualization of the sum of all flow influences is presented in fig 8 note that the flow reduction due to the viscous interactions in fig 8 is exaggerated and set to 15 to better visualize the vortex paths additionally the deck house and its influence on the flow is visible as a rectangle in the left side of fig 8 the interactions caused by the superstructure are further discussed in section 3 4 in fig 9 the thrust from the rotors arranged according to fig 7 is shown for twa from 0 to 360 including the potential a and viscous flow b interaction effects for the latter case the wind speed reduction is exaggerated and set to 15 to better visualize the impact all rotors are operated at the maximum net thrust point it can clearly be seen that the forward rotors i e numbers 1 and 4 largely benefit from the interaction with the other rotors while rotors 2 and 3 suffer the decrease in performance for rotors in a vortex path can be seen for rotor 1 at approximately 120 twa approximately 90 awa and for rotor 4 at approximately 240 twa approximately 270 awa additionally rotor 2 is in the path of rotor 4 at approximately 20 awa while rotor 3 is in the path of rotor 1 at approximately 340 awa without the viscous interaction the total thrust from all four rotors is slightly higher less than 1 if computed with potential interaction compared to the thrust without interaction this increase can be explained by the circulation that is built up around the array of rotors comparable to the circulation around the head and main sail of a yacht bethwaite 2013 it must be noted that the side forces created by the sails are also increased due to the flow interactions during the rpm optimization see section 4 2 1 rotor 1 is often reefed reduced rpm due to the high side forces it creates comparing the results with and without flow interaction the center of effort of the side force differs by 6 30 with the center of effort evaluated with interaction effects being further forward this difference has a large impact on the overall performance of the ship due to the interaction effects with the hull see section 3 5 furthermore reliable rpm control of the rotors see section 4 2 1 is only possible if the local wind speed and angle are estimated both the rpm control and the difference of the center of effort prove it crucial to include aerodynamic interaction effects when evaluating the performance of wind assisted propulsion with more than one sail installed on the ship it must be concluded that the dominating part of the aerodynamic interaction is potential part i e the induced circulation causing a change of the local wind speeds and angles furthermore the results of the simulated aerodynamic interactions and the forces generated by the flettner rotors are verified against model and full scale measurements in section 3 5 3 4 sail superstructure interaction the presence of working sails ahead or behind a superstructure changes the angle and velocity of the inflow the local wind speed and angle at the position of the superstructure are calculated using the method described in section 3 3 an example is presented in fig 7 additionally the superstructure can affect the sails if a sail occurs in the upstream vortex or in the downstream wake meroney 1985 however this will only occur in a small range of wind angles such as close to stern wind and close to head wind both of which are not favorable conditions for sailing the model described below is thus simplified and only intended to capture the decrease of forces of the idling rotors for the above conditions as shown in meroney 1985 the upstream vortex only affects an area of the height of less than 1 3 of the superstructure height and extends less than half of the height forward thus the upstream vortex is neglected in this study the downstream wake is modeled using a sinusoidal reduction of the wind speed from zero at the superstructure until it reaches the free wind speed at a distance equal to 20 times the height of the superstructure this agrees with the measured wake behind buildings in meroney 1985 the wake behind the superstructure is visualized in fig 8 3 5 verification of the aerodynamic forces the sail module of shipclean i e the formulations to calculate the lift and drag as well as the method to evaluate aerodynamic interactions have been compared to results from cfd model tests and full scale measurements in a first step the lift drag and power coefficients of a single flettner rotor are compared between i full scale measurements ii shipclean simulations iii cfd results from li et al 2012 kramer et al 2016 and iv model test results from bordogna et al 2020 the full scale measurements were collected on board a cruise ferry with a single 4 24m flettner rotor installed norsepower 2019a the total thrust and side force were measured using force transducers at the foundation of the rotors the power needed to rotate the rotor was measured as the power consumption of the electric motor installed for the rotor wind speed and angle were measured with the ship s own instruments measurements were only taken in static sailing conditions i e constant ship speed and heading fig 10 presents the results from the comparison for the analysis the wind speed profile as presented in section 3 2 is applied to calculate the wind speed experienced by the flettner rotor since no data filtering was applied the results from the full scale measurements show some scatter however clear clusters of measurement results can be found for both the lift and drag coefficients and the power coefficients the comparison in fig 10a shows that the lift coefficient in the full scale measurement is considerably higher than the lift coefficient predicted in li et al 2012 and measured in model scale in bordogna et al 2020 at a spin ratio of sr 3 for example the results from bordogna et al 2020 show a lift coefficient of about 6 5 the results from li et al 2012 about 8 5 and the shipclean simulations of the full scale measurements give a lift coefficient of about 9 5 it must be noted that the aspect ratio of the rotors in bordogna et al 2020 is ar 5 compared to ar 6 in the full scale measurements and in li et al 2012 kramer et al 2016 in the study presented in bordogna et al 2020 tests at different reynolds numbers re were performed the results indicate a considerable scale effect with the lift forces increasing with increasing reynolds number this could explain the higher measured lift forces in full scale fig 10b shows that the results of the drag coefficient align well for spin ratios larger than 1 at sr lower than one the shipclean simulations give lower values at a spin ratio of sr 0 5 the shipclean simulation gives a value of about 0 3 while the full and model scale measurements show values of about 0 5 0 8 this underprediction will reduce the penalties of installed flettner rotors in head wind fig 10c shows that the power coefficient in kramer et al 2016 underestimates the actual measured power in full scale this is expected since the results in kramer et al 2016 do not include any losses due to friction in the bearings or losses in the electrical motor it must be noted that the lift drag and power coefficients generally show worse agreement at high spin ratios however in typical operation a spin ratio of around 1 5 2 5 is often optimal in this range the different methods and results agree better in a second step the sail interaction was verified by comparing the performance of two flettner rotors placed along the longitudinal axis with a distance of 3 rotor diameters the forward rotor was denoted as rotor a the tested conditions are summarized in table 1 results of the shipclean simulation and from the model tests in bordogna et al 2020 are presented in fig 11 a for case a and fig 11b for case b from fig 11 it can be concluded that the thrust coefficients from measurements and shipclean predictions show similar trends in beating conditions the thrust coefficient is significantly reduced up to 38 according to measurements at 30 awa in case a in reaching conditions the thrust coefficient is increased with up to 7 for case b the side force coefficients are increased in most conditions due to the interaction effects for case a the shipclean predictions are lower than the model test results for beating conditions but do not include the sudden decrease of side force shown in the measurement results at around 120 awa as discussed in bordogna et al 2020 model test results also include significant uncertainties which might cause this sudden decrease alternatively some effects are not captured by the method in shipclean for case b shipclean overpredicts the influences on the side force when compared to the model tests results for case b and an awa of 90 shipclean shows an increase of the side force with 11 compared to the 5 in the measurement results it must be kept in mind that the flettner rotors in shipclean and in the model tests have different aspect ratios and different lift and drag coefficients see fig 10 since the potential flow interactions are coupled to the induced circulation which is coupled to the lift generation of the flettner rotors this difference will influence the absolute values in the comparison from the results it must be concluded that the method presented in section 3 3 shows good agreement with the trends for the thrust and side force when compared to model test results the side force might be overpredicted which leads to a somewhat conservative prediction of the total performance of a ship it must further be noted that the presented results are for rotors at a fixed sr related to the free stream velocity as discussed in section 3 3 the differences in total performance can be much smaller than the difference shown here since the rotors can be operated at an optimal spin ratio for the local wind speed and angle 3 6 sail hull interaction since the sails introduce large side forces on the ship the main concern in the hydrodynamic interaction between the sails and the hull is the compensation of the introduced side force by drifting and rudder forces the distribution of the side force between the rudder and the hull is coupled to the superstructure and the position of the rotors since the rudder must compensate for the yaw moment introduced by the windage and the sails the lift and drag forces are computed by 21 l c l ρ 2 u 2 l p p t 22 d c d ρ 2 u 2 l p p t the rudder forces can be computed using basic wing theory which in shipclean is implemented by the formulas given in

02 c b b l p p 0 68 to verify and adjust a method to evaluate the lift and drag of a ship hull at drift three sets of model test results are used in this study i model tests of a series 60 hull reported in longo and stern 2002 ii model tests and cfd computations of a series of hulls with different block coefficients hull 1 cb 0 72 hull 16 cb 0 83 and hull 19 cb 0 64 reported in van der kolk et al 2019b and iii model tests of a tanker reported in kume et al 2006 it must be noted that the side force moment and the induced resistance at small drift angles are small values compared to the ship s resistance thus large deviations can be expected as discussed and shown in kume et al 2006 in kume et al 2006 the standard deviations for the resistance side force and moment were evaluated to be approximately 3 5 keeping in mind that the measured resistance includes the resistance without drift which will increase the uncertainty of the induced resistance in van der kolk et al 2019b it has been shown that the difference between simulation results and model test results is the largest for the induced drag it should also be noted that side forces and added resistances are often given in the ship fixed coordinate system and must thus be converted to the lift and drag forces in the flow oriented coordinate system which is used in this study the side force and drag due to drift are often estimated using empirical methods for maneuvering e g according to inoue and hirano 1987 however as shown in fig 12 the side force is highly overpredicted up to 400 when using this method compared to the data presented in van der kolk et al 2019b kijima et al 1990 longo and stern 2002 thus the method proposed in inoue and hirano 1987 is found unsuitable for the analysis of the static sailing condition of wind assisted propelled ships fig 12 also shows that hull 16 of the delft series has significantly higher lift forces than the other two hulls in the series even though the only difference is the block coefficient to analyze the hydrodynamic response of wind assisted propelled ships three parameters are crucial i the hydrodynamic lift ii the hydrodynamic drag and iii the center of effort of the lift force as explained in sections 1 and 2 the shipclean model is intended to provide fast predictions with a very limited input i e only the main dimensions of a ship thus more sophisticated methods for the prediction of the abovementioned force and moment parameters such as the method in hooft 1996 or cfd computations cannot be applied since the hull form is unknown and the computations would be too time consuming alternative methods could be to i build up data bases of results with standard series hulls using model tests ii cfd computations or iii to apply theoretical methods using only the main parameters of the hull which is done in this study the following section describes in detail how the side force drag and yaw moment are evaluated using wing theory for small aspect ratio wings low aspect ratio ar wings are defined as wings with ar 4 hoerner 1985 cargo ships have aspect ratios draft to length ratios of well below one and are thus suitable to be analyzed with the low aspect ratio wing theory according to the theory for the lift and drag of low aspect ratio as presented in hoerner 1985 the potential flow lift and induced drag are only influenced by the efficient aspect ratio of the wing the relation between the aspect ratio and the efficient aspect ratio depends mainly on the rounding of the edges i e the bilge radius and the planform additionally a cross flow drag is considerable for small aspect ratio wings in summary one goal of the study is to relate the lift and drag of a hull to its aspect ratio and possibly the block coefficient or main frame area coefficient 3 6 1 limitations of the model the presented model implemented in shipclean can only be applied on drift angles where there is circulatory lift i e below the angle of maximum lift in hoerner 1985 it was shown that this angle is expected to be 20 40 for aspect ratios close to those of ships which is much higher than reasonable drift angles for static ship operations in van der kolk 2016 inoue and hirano 1987 it was discussed that the wave pattern affects the lift and drag of a ship hull however the low aspect ratio wing theory does not account for two phase flows thus these effects will not be captured unless the coefficients can be related to the residual resistance cr as discussed in houghton et al 2017 hooft 1996 the form of the leading edge of a wing section bow shape the planform shape lateral plan and edges bilge have a significant influence on the lift and drag characteristics due to the limited and simplified input to the shipclean model such hull form features are unknown i e not required as input and thus cannot be considered unless the effects can be related to form parameters such as the block prismatic or main frame area coefficient due to the nature of shipclean the ships are assumed to be of conventional shape e g have a full lateral plan 3 6 2 hydrodynamic lift forces of the hull to estimate the lift and drag of the hull at a drift angle in a more theoretical way two approaches can be used the lifting line wing theory or the slender body theory the slender body theory is often applied to cylinder shapes e g in jorgensen 1973 and barros et al 2008 it was shown that the slender body theory well predicts the lift force of cylinders with small aspect ratios however the induced drag is underpredicted especially for small drift angles it is thus not suitable for the modeling of large ships with wind assisted propulsion thus in this study wing theory for low aspect ratio wings is applied on ships sailing at a drift angle according to hoerner 1985 the lift coefficient of a low aspect ratio wing ar 1 is composed of a linear cl1 and a nonlinear cl2 part 29 c l c l 1 c l 2 30 c l 1 1 δ b b 2 0 5 π a r sin β 31 c l 2 k sin β sin β cos β the term 1 δ b b 2 in equation 30 represents the decrease of the aspect ratio due to rounded edges of a low aspect ratio wing hoerner 1985 for wings with a rounded plan form and rounded lateral edges this might be set equal to 0 78 hoerner 1985 the factor k in equation 31 represents the cross flow drag coefficient hooft 1996 which depends on the shape of the wing and can be compared to the cross flow drag coefficient described in hooft 1996 it was argued in hoerner 1985 that the 2d profile of the wing and the thickness ratio have a minor effect on the lift coefficient but that the main effect is from the planform and the shape of the edges i e sharp or rounded edges in van der kolk 2016 it was discussed that cl2 is mainly dependent on the vortices created along the bilge of a ship and thus highly dependent on hull form features such as bilge radius and the shape of the aftbody skeg using the measured lift coefficients of the three sample hulls the factor k is evaluated and the results are shown in fig 13 the calculated k values in fig 13 decrease with increasing drift angle for hull 16 of the delft series and the tanker increase for the series 60 and hull 19 of the delft series and is constant for hull 1 of the delft series an increasing k value could motivate the linear part to be overpredicted and vice versa however from fig 13 no conclusions can be drawn about any dependency of the linear part on the ship s parameters e g the delft hull 16 and the series 60 hull are very similar in aspect ratio thickness ratio b lpp and block coefficient but show the opposite behavior in fig 13 it should be noted that the delft hull series does not have any aft body skeg thus the lateral area will increase with increasing block coefficient which certainly will influence the lift and drag according to the theory presented in hoerner 1985 the value of k should highly depend on the shape and rounding of the edges i e the bilge radius if this would be the case for ships it should be correlated to the block coefficient ships with low block coefficients have a higher bilge radius and should thus have a lower k value in contrast to this theory the quadratic part of the side force can be determined according to inoue and hirano 1987 32 y v v 0 244 6 67 1 c b t d b 0 05 increasing with decreasing block coefficient the mean value of the evaluated k value from the model tests is shown in fig 14 from these results no dependency of k on the block coefficient can be derived since it is not possible to detect a dependency of the value of k which is related to the cross flow drag on any of the typical hull parameters such as length to draft length to beam beam to draft or block coefficient it must be concluded that the k value highly depends on local hull form features as discussed in van der kolk 2016 consequently since the hull form is not mimicked in shipclean the average value of k shown in fig 14 is then used for the prediction of the side force 33 c l c l 1 c l 2 0 8 0 5 π a r sin β 0 6541 sin β sin β cos β the k value of 0 6541 is as expected much lower than the theoretical value of 2 for a flat plate hoerner 1985 as it is presented in fig 14 the k can differ significantly between different ships this introduces uncertainties in the prediction of the drift angle however since the crossflow force is also included in the drag calculation using the same k value see section 3 5 3 the lift to drag ratio is less affected a comparison of the measured and the predicted lift coefficient is presented in fig 15 a the prediction according to equation 33 gives a 30 lower lift coefficient than the measurements for the series 60 hull and a 50 higher value for the tanker with the delft series in between however for the performance prediction of wind assisted ships the resulting drift angle is of higher importance than the value of the generated side force in fig 15b a comparison of the drift angle during measurements and the drift angle that would generate the same lift according to the prediction are compared the drift angles of all delft hulls are very close with a maximum of 1 degree deviation the series 60 hull shows a deviation of approximately 2 at the largest drift angle during measurements 10 and the deviation for the tanker increases to 3 keeping in mind the limited input to the shipclean model and the measurement uncertainties these are acceptable prediction results especially since the drag coefficient is coupled to the lift coefficient and not the drift angle as described in the following section to improve this method more data is needed to find relations between the hull parameters especially the bilge radius and block coefficient on i the k value and ii the efficient aspect ratio i e the factor 1 δ b b 2 3 6 3 hydrodynamic drag forces of the hull the prediction of the induced drag of the hull based on model tests or simulations is difficult since any uncertainties in the measurement of the longitudinal force will highly affect the induced drag which at small drift angles is just a small part of the total drag force with respect to this the results from model tests must be handled carefully and it must be expected that theoretical predictions will not accurately reflect all model test results as described in section 3 5 2 the lift force consists of two parts a linear part cl1 and a nonlinear part caused by the cross flow drag cl2 subsequently the drag must also be divided into two parts 34 c d i c d i 1 c d i 2 the crossflow drag is a force acting normal to the ship s longitudinal axis where the part normal to the inflow is considered as a lift force the part parallel to the inflow is subsequently considered as drag 35 c d i 2 k sin 3 β using the k values shown in fig 13 the induced drag coefficient cdi1 is computed in fig 16 the ratio of the potential lift coefficient cl1 to the induced drag coefficient cdi1 over the drift angle is presented it must be noted that the presented lift to drag ratios are not the final values of the hull since the corresponding parts of the crossflow force are added for both the lift and the drag according to hoerner 1985 the induced drag increases linearly with the drift angle and the potential part of the lift coefficient and can be computed by with the drift angle β in radians 36 c d i c l 1 β a where a 0 5 according to hoerner 1985 estimations of the values of factor a for the sample ships are shown in fig 17 a the value of a is larger than 0 5 for all hulls and the drag coefficient is not linear to the drift angle in fig 17b the value of a for each hull is shown assuming that cdi is proportional to β0 6 which appears to be a better fit since the values of a are almost constant over the drift angle it can be observed that the hulls of the delft series show a large spread of the estimated values of a this implies that a is increasing with increasing block midship or prismatic coefficient since all other dimensions are equal for the hulls of the series however hull 1 of the delft series cb 0 72 cm 0 942 ar 0 0471 shows almost identical values of a as the series 60 hull cb 0 6 cm 0 977 ar 0 0535 additionally the tanker cb 0 81 cm 0 985 ar 0 0613 shows smaller values of a than the series 60 and the delft hull 1 which contradicts the trends observed from the hulls of the delft series as mentioned in section 3 5 2 the hulls of the delft series do not have any aftbody skegs which will cause additional effects since the lateral area will increase with increasing block coefficient as discussed in section 3 5 1 the drag and lift coefficient might be affected by the wave pattern a measure for the energy in the wave pattern and thus the wave heights is the wave resistance i e the residual resistance of a hull in fig 18 the mean values of a from fig 17b are related to the residual resistance coefficients cr of the hulls estimated by shipclean for the block coefficient the delft series hulls show an increasing trend of a with increasing cr while the group of the series 60 delft hull 1 and the tanker show the contrary in conclusion with the available data no clear dependency of the value of a on the block coefficient the aspect ratio or the residual resistance coefficient can be found thus the average value of a of all hulls is used which appears to be close to the value proposed in hoerner 1985 even though a linear dependency on the drift angle is assumed there in summary the induced drag can be computed by 37 c d i 0 66 c l β 0 6 0 6541 sin 3 β the lift to drag relation of all hulls is shown in fig 19 for the measured lift and drag continuous lines and the predicted lift and drag dashed lines since the lift and drag coefficients proposed in this study only depend on the aspect ratio all hulls of the delft series will have identical coefficients naturally the largest deviation between the measured and predicted lift to drag is found for the delft hulls 16 and 19 for the other hulls the deviation of the lift to drag ratio is within 15 which is deemed to be acceptable because of the limited input to the prediction and the limited measurement data available with more measurements or simulations a relation between the hull parameters especially the block coefficient and the factor a might be found additionally local hull form features especially the bow i e the leading edge will have considerable effects on the drag force 3 6 4 center of effort of the hydrodynamic lift force accurately predicting the center of effort of the lift force is crucial to predicting the necessary rudder angle the center of effort of the crossflow and the potential part of the lift force are at the geometric center of the lateral area kume et al 2006 and close to the center of the low pressure in the bow region abbot and von doenhoff 1959 respectively additionally the pressure distribution with low pressures at the forward downstream side and aft upstream side and high pressures at the forward up stream and aft downstream side creates a moment that tends to rotate the ship broadside to the flow this moment is also called the munk moment lewandowski 2004 since it is not possible to calculate the value of the munk moment without cfd computations it is included in the estimation of the center of the lifting force however empirical methods for maneuvering predictions as in inoue and hirano 1987 include the munk moment in the prediction of the yaw moment the munk moment is also the cause that some ships experience force centers well ahead of the ship as for example reported in van der kolk et al 2019b for a 2d wing the center of effort of the lift force including the munk moment is approximately 25 of the chord length from the tip and the center of effort moves towards the leading edge for 3d wings with decreasing aspect ratios abbot and von doenhoff 1959 since the aspect ratios of ships are very small the center of effort should be close to the bow the measurement results of the series 60 and the tanker prove this statement however the results from the delft series indicate that the center of effort is in front of the hull by up to a full ship length however the delft hull series is rather special since the hulls do not have any form of skeg in the aft thus the center of the lateral plane is far forward compared to the other hulls in fig 20 the measured center of effort of the series 60 and the tanker are compared with the predicted center of effort from the method proposed in inoue and hirano 1987 although the prediction does not fully match the measured values the trend of a more aft position of the center of effort with increasing drift angle is captured since both the side force and the yaw moment are small in model tests the calculated center of effort from model test results can deviate from reality in shipclean the center of effort is predicted using the equations proposed in inoue and hirano 1987 38 c o e n h y h l p p n v y v sin β n v v y v v s i n β 2 l p p 39 n v 2 t l p p 40 n v v 0 066 0 96 1 c b t b 41 y v π t l p p 1 4 c b

an efficient possibility to achieve high lift to drag ratios these centerboards must be high aspect ratio wings i e ar 4 the lift and drag coefficients of a high aspect ratio wing can be computed by

section presents examples of cases that refer to ship operations retrofitting and new designs of wind assisted ships the purpose is to demonstrate the usability of the shipclean model and how it can be used as a powerful simulation tool to analyze compare and recommend the design and operation of wind assisted ships section 4 2 discusses different modes of operation i e control of the rotor s rpm in section 4 3 the optimal placing and number of rotors are discussed followed by analyses of specific design recommendations for wind assisted propulsion section 4 4 discusses changes of the hull form propeller and general ship design if a ship is designed from scratch to have wind assisted propulsion uncertainties in the prediction of fuel savings from the flettner rotors are discussed in section 4 5 two ships a two propeller open shaft roro and a conventional single skeg tanker with main dimensions according to table 2 are used as case study ships the dimensions and costs of the flettner rotors are shown in table 3 based on data in norsepower 2019b initially both ships are equipped with four rotors as shown in fig 21 these initial configurations are used for the studies in section 4 2 the rotors are arranged to not interfere with the superstructure or the cargo area of the ships for the faster twin propeller and rudder roro the rotors are placed further aft since the ship has a forward superstructure and the double rudders can take more side force loads polar plots of the fuel consumption per nautical mile nm with sails related to the fuel consumption per nm without sails are shown in fig 22 for a tws of 10 m s and a ship speed of 12 kn for the tanker and a ship speed of 18 kn for the roro with this wind speed and a twa less than 40 50 degrees off bow the sails create added fuel consumption however the sails can generate fuel savings of up to 65 for the tanker and 55 for the roro for both ships the maximum savings are at a twa of approximately 110 the power consumption of the rotors is included in the remaining propulsion power and thus affects the fuel consumption the maximum rotor power is about 100 kw for a single 5 30m flettner rotor for the ships with 4 flettner rotors this corresponds to a maximal power consumption of the rotors of about 5 of the calm water propulsion power of the roro at 18kn and about 15 of the calm water propulsion power of the tanker at 12 kn 4 1 weather conditions and method to evaluate the expected savings wind measurements from ships on two routes one on the pacific ocean and one on the baltic sea are available from reference vessels in the shipclean project these measurements are used to simulate and assess the performance of the wind assisted ships for several scenarios the tanker is evaluated with the measurements from the pacific ocean and the roro with the weather from the baltic sea measurements were taken every hour over a full year a total of 6600 measurements with ship speeds higher than 5kn were taken for the pacific ocean route up time of 76 and 4700 measurements with ship speeds higher than 5kn were taken for the baltic sea route up time of 54 wind rose plots of the measured twa and tws on the pacific ocean a and the baltic sea b are presented in fig 23 although shipclean can simulate asymmetric rotor arrangements the current study is limited to symmetric arrangements of the rotors thus the wind angles are shown only for 0 180 twa with a peak at approximately 90 140 the wind angles on the pacific ocean route are much more favorable than on the baltic sea route which shows a peak at approximately 10 80 for both routes the wind speeds are distributed equally independent of the wind angle to save computational time a weighting system for different wind angles and speeds is developed the goal is to evaluate a set of 4 polar diagrams in steps of 20 for each ship a total of 40 points per ship at operational speed the simulations were performed for one target speed and account for involuntary speed loss i e reduced speed if the required power and rpm are outside of the engine envelope tillig et al 2017 the fuel savings at each angle will be multiplied with a weighting for the twa and the sum of all savings at one tws will then be multiplied by a factor for the wind speed with this procedure described in more detail later in this section it is possible to predict the expected fuel savings on the routes without evaluating each single measurement point however all points will be simulated for the ships without sails to obtain a benchmark fuel consumption to predict the payback times of the rotors to evaluate the weights probability density distributions pdf are fit to the measurement data histograms of the measurement data and the pdfs are presented in fig 24 for the twa and fig 25 for the tws weibull distributions are used for the tws data and kernel distributions are used for the twa data the weights are evaluated by 47 w x 1 x 2 p d f d x 0 x m a x p d f d x the resulting weights for the selected twa and tws ranges are shown in table 4 and table 5 together with the twa and tws that are used for estimating the fuel savings for the twa and tws range twsc twac the expected fuel savings are computed as the weighted sum of the estimated savings in all tws and twa combinations for the ships without and with sails the difference between the fuel consumption evaluated with all points of the route and the fuel consumption evaluated with the above method is 2 2 and 2 7 for the tanker and 3 1 and 3 3 for the roro respectively considering that the power difference caused by an increase of the wave height from 3 to 4m is about 19 for the roro and 34 for the tanker these differences are smaller than what could be expected between different years due to different weather conditions the above described method thus proved to be suitable for predicting fuel savings with acceptable accuracy for the purpose of the simulations and analyses an even more accurate prediction of the long term fuel savings could be achieved by increasing the time span of the measurements from 1 year to multiple years however for this study the time span of the measurements was limited to one year the wave heights are computed according to equations 48 and 49 coastal engineering resea 1984 with a maximum fetch of 50 nm for the baltic sea and 300 nm for the pacific ocean the wave encounter angle is assumed to be equal to the twa this assumption introduces uncertainties see section 4 5 since neither geographical effects e g land protection and shallow water or swell waves caused by weather systems further away are respected in the wave height estimation 48 h s 0 01616 u a f e t c h 49 u a 0 71 t w s 1 23 tws in m s 4 2 operation two main problems exist in the operation of wind assisted propelled ships using flettner rotors i choosing the optimal rpm of the rotors and ii choosing the optimal course wind angle to minimize the fuel consumption with constant velocity made good vmg while the second optimal wind angles is similar for other sail types the first problem is ultimately about choosing the optimal angle of attack of the sails the importance of an efficient rpm control is discussed in bordogna et al 2020 in bordogna et al 2020 it is shown that possible negative interaction effects between rotors can be highly reduced with a rpm control 4 2 1 rpm control of flettner rotors on a ship if the interaction between the sails and the hull is neglected i e drift and associated induced resistance and heel the optimal rpm of the flettner rotors is determined by maximizing the net power as shown in equation 10 however since interaction must be considered the rpm of single or several rotors sails must be reduced in certain conditions hereafter called reefed the sails must be reefed in case at least one of the following conditions is true 1 the heel angle is larger than the allowed maximum in shipclean ϕmax 8 2 the rudder angle is larger than the allowed maximum in shipclean δmax 10 3 the sails cause resistance instead of a forward thrust 4 the induced resistances from the rudder and hull drift are reduced more than the sail thrust if the sails are reefed i e the rpm of one or several rotors is reduced cases 1 3 can be identified from the 4 dof solution and case number 4 i e that the additional drag reduces quicker than the sail thrust can only be investigated by comparing a reefed and non reefed condition however case 4 is the most important for achieving the maximum efficiency of the sails especially in apparent wind angles forward from abeam for case number 3 i e the sails causing resistance instead of thrust all sails are put into idle mode i e the rpm at which the drag is minimal the minimum drag is found to be at a spin ratio of approximately 0 5 li et al 2012 kramer et al 2016 in all other cases only the most suitable rotors should be reefed to achieve the best possible balance between hull drift and rudder angle by moving the center of effort of the sail forces from analyzing the formulation for the lift and drag of the rudder equation 23 and 24 and the hull equation 33 and 37 it can be found that the lift to drag ratio of the rudder is much higher than the lift to drag ratio of the hull thus to minimize drag as much of the required lift force as possible must be delivered from the rudder for all conditions with side forces equal to or higher than the lift force of the rudder at the maximum angle the maximum rudder angle will be optimal three different conditions must thus be defined to specify which rotor to reef 1 the rudder angle is close to the optimal angle 2 the rudder angle is smaller than the optimal angle 3 the rudder angle is larger than the optimal angle for condition 1 all rotors are reefed simultaneously to keep the yaw moment as constant as possible for conditions two and three a score system is employed the score system assumes that the first rotors to reef are those with a low thrust to side force ratio thus those rotors obtain low scores additionally a score is added for the yaw moment for condition 2 rotors with a low yaw moment obtain low scores since the rudder angle i e the yaw moment will be larger for condition 3 rotors with high yaw moments obtain low scores in all cases reefing is performed iteratively with reefing factors evaluated from the required difference in side force or yaw moment the fuel savings with and without rpm control in 10 m s tws are presented in fig 26 for the tanker a and the roro b it is obvious that rpm control is crucial to maximize savings and avoid added consumption in twa between 30 and 80 degrees off bow using the method described in section 4 1 the estimated fuel saving for the roro with the initial sail set up and the rpm control is 14 3 without the rpm control this drops to 12 0 for the tanker the fuel savings are 26 0 with the rpm control and 24 8 without in fig 27 the rpm of each rotor is presented for the tanker a and roro b it must be kept in mind that a low rpm is not always the result of reefing but might be due to lower local wind speeds or different wind angles the results from the roro show that the full sail power i e all sails at full rpm is only used at a twa more than 110 degrees off bow it must be concluded that even if the sails produce thrust in wind angles more than 30 degrees off bow it is not beneficial to run all sails with full rpm in all conditions 4 2 2 optimal twa in fig 22 the fuel savings are highly dependent on the twa thus it can be assumed that it is beneficial to divert from the direct course to sail at more favorable twa while increasing the speed to keep the velocity made good vmg constant the speed at the new course can be computed by with twainit as the twa on the direct course 50 v s v s i n i t cos t w a t w a i n i t in fig 28 the fuel consumption per hour related to the fuel consumption on the direct course is shown for 3 diversion angles and 5 initial twas while there are no fuel savings if the twa on the direct course is 0 headwind the gains at an initial twa of 80 can reach 30 it must be noted that the results do account for increased ship speed due to the longer distance travelled but do not account for any necessary tacking or different wind angles further into the journey in order to reach the destination naturally the results for the complete journey highly depend on the weather ahead the achievable fuel savings and the dependency of the results on the weather along the route show the necessity of sophisticated weather routing for wind assisted ships 4 3 retrofit the focus in this section as part of a retrofit project is on the optimal size and number of sails and on the optimal position of the sails before varying the position of the sails 7 different arrangements are evaluated for the tanker and 4 different arrangements are evaluated for the roro see fig 29 the arrangements are designed and chosen to have similar geometric centers of the array of rotors the shipclean model with wind assisted propulsion was used to make simulations and analyses of the fuel savings for each of the cases the results are shown in fig 30 a for the 7 rotor arrangements on the tanker using the pacific ocean route and fig 30b for the 4 rotor arrangements on the roro using the baltic sea route additionally the payback times are estimated for 3 different fuel prices 300 eur ton 500 eur ton and 700 eur ton the results from this economic analysis are shown in fig 31 a for the tanker and fig 31b for the roro the results show that compared to the ships without wind assisted propulsion fuel savings greater than 30 can be achieved for the tanker savings for the roro are found to reach 14 since the fuel savings do not increase linearly with the number of rotors due to headwind and reefing but the investment and maintenance costs do the payback time is found to be the shortest for the arrangements with the fewest sails comparing the results from arrangements t4 1 t4 2 t6 1 t6 2 r2 1 and r2 2 it becomes obvious that due to interaction effects between the rotor sails it is important to choose the optimal arrangement for a given number of rotors however it must be kept in mind that the positions of the rotors in this study are not fully optimized for those arrangements the two most promising arrangements the one with the shortest payback time and the one with the highest savings per ship are chosen for further variation of the rotor s position the variables for variation are the longitudinal positions of the rotors during the variation a minimal distance between the rotors of 10 of the ship s length is ensured the best variants from this study are presented in table 6 with the fuel savings from the initial positions shown within brackets the results show that the savings are larger if the rotors are arranged further aft i e if the side force on the rudder is higher how far aft the rotors can be arranged depends on the size of the rudder and the speed of the ship i e the maximal side force the rudder s can produce due to the double rudders and higher speeds of the roro the best arrangement for this ship is when the aft rotors are almost above the rudder 4 4 new design from the result with the two example ships and the theory in section 3 it can be concluded that if the superstructure is short and the deck is free the focus during a new design project for wind assisted ships should be on the hydrodynamics with high side and thrust forces from the sails there are two areas of interest for improvement of hydrodynamics of wind assisted ships i the propeller design due to varying thrust load and ii the hydrodynamic lift generation since the side force from the sails must be compensated the first area the propeller design addresses avoiding pressure side cavitation which occurs at low propeller loads i e when the sails produce a considerable amount of forward thrust since the sails contribute up to 100 of the necessary thrust there will be conditions when the propeller is windmilling for the tanker with the t6 1 sail arrangement the propeller loadings are between 0 and 125 of the propeller loadings without sails due to those variable propeller loadings it must be concluded that ships designed for wind assisted propulsion i e with considerable large sail areas must be equipped with a controllable pitch propeller to avoid pressure side cavitation to increase the hydrodynamic lift generated by the hull the hull form should be designed accordingly in equation 33 it is shown that the generated lift is linearly dependent on the aspect ratio of the hull thus wind assisted ships should be designed with the highest ar possible i e high draft and short length however decreasing the length will increase the resistance as shown in section 3 5 there are differences in the lift and drag coefficients of the hulls studied that could not be captured by the wing theory which indicates that the hulls of wind assisted ships must be evaluated at a drift angle already in the design stage however even the hulls with the best lift to drag ratio are considerably worse than wings with high aspect ratios thus the most efficient way to increase the lift to drag ratio is to increase the area of any high aspect ratio wings on the hull i e the appendages for typical hulls this is only the rudder s one consideration could thus be to design the ships with twin rudders even if the ship is a single propeller design furthermore center or daggerboards could be applied to the hull as discussed in section 3 5 5 to show the effect of centerboards and double rudders the tanker and roro examples are modified the tanker is fitted with double rudders i e the rudder area is doubled and a centerboard the double rudders are not placed in the propeller slipstream which reduces the rudder forces this effect is captured in shipclean for the roro two daggerboards are fitted that are designed to keep the draft below 10 m i e suitable for the baltic sea while the centerboard of the tanker is designed to be theoretically fully hoistable into the hull the position of the centerboard is chosen slightly forward of the geometrical center of the sails the dimensions of the applied dagger centerboards are shown in table 7 the tanker is tested with the t6 1 rotor arrangement and the roro is tested with the r4 arrangement for the tanker the centerboard and double rudders increase the savings from 32 1 to 36 1 and for the roro the savings increase from 14 3 to 16 8 the results show that centerboards can increase the efficiency of a wind assisted propelled ship however to achieve maximum savings the side force distribution between the hull the rudder and the centerboard must be optimal this requires the centerboard position to be optimized together with the sail arrangement and position 4 5 uncertainties in the prediction of fuel savings from wind assisted propulsion this section presents a discussion of the uncertainties in the prediction of fuel savings from wind assisted propulsion it must be noted that this is a qualitative discussion of the uncertainties but not a complete quantitative uncertainty study especially for the full scale sail forces drift forces and aerodynamic interaction effects more measurement data must be available to quantitatively evaluate the uncertainties uncertainties in the prediction of the fuel consumption and fuel savings with wind assisted propulsion can be divided into four parts i uncertainties in the prediction of the hull resistance propulsive efficiency and specific fuel oil consumption of the engine ii uncertainties in the prediction of the sail forces iii uncertainties in the prediction of the hydrodynamic lift and drag of the hull and iv uncertainties in the prediction of the encountered weather the uncertainties in the power prediction using shipclean are quantified in tillig et al 2018 however since only fuel savings are of interest in this study these uncertainties will not affect the results since the resistance and propulsive efficiency are similar for the ship with and without wind assisted propulsion since the payback time depends on the total fuel costs it will be influenced by the uncertainties quantified in tillig et al 2018 the sail forces of a single rotor were verified against full scale measurements with good agreement for the lift drag and power coefficients see section 3 5 the comparison of the lift coefficient in a typical operational range of spin ratios between sr 1 5 and sr 2 5 shows that the difference between the full scale measurements and the shipclean prediction are less than 0 2 and the difference to the values according to li et al 2012 is less than 4 a similar comparison for the drag coefficient shows a difference of less than 1 for the shipclean predictions which is in agreement with the values in li et al 2012 the predicted power coefficient is within 1 of the mean value of the measurements for the given sr range the above differences show that the expected uncertainty in the prediction of the sail forces and power consumption for a single rotor is most likely well below 4 the prediction of the aerodynamic influences was compared to model test results see section 3 5 and it was shown that the predictions and the measured trends of the thrust forces were similar larger differences were found for the side forces however a quantification of uncertainties based on this comparison is not possible since the rotors were of different geometry and showed different lift and drag coefficients in single rotor tests however the influence of the aerodynamic interaction on the total thrust is small if the rotors are operated at their optimal sr for the local wind speed and direction as discussed in section 3 3 larger differences were found for the longitudinal center of the sail forces it is thus concluded that the uncertainty of the prediction of the fuel savings related to the aerodynamic interactions is small however uncertainty in the optimal positions of the rotors might be considerable the largest model uncertainties are expected from the lift and drag force prediction of the hull sailing at a drift angle in section 3 5 2 it is discussed that the predicted drift angle shows a difference of 1 3 at approximately 10 degrees of drift compared to the model tests of the sample ships however a difference of 1 3 in drift angle only results in a maximum difference of sail thrust due to the change of twa of approximately 1 thus more emphasis is put on an accurate prediction of the lift to drag ratio of a ship in section 3 5 3 it is evaluated that the predicted drag force differs by approximately 15 from the measured drag force during model tests of the sample ships for the tanker and the roro with the sail arrangements t4 1 and r4 the average of the predicted drag force is approximately 8 of the calm water resistance thus for these sail arrangements the uncertainty of the fuel saving prediction due to the uncertainty of the drag force can be estimated to approximately 2 these results show that the accuracy of the drift angle prediction i e the prediction of the lift force is not as important as the accurate prediction of the lift to drag relation of the hull large uncertainties are related to the prediction or variation of the weather conditions the ship will experience during its voyage to quantify the standard deviation and mean value of the fuel savings monte carlo simulations with statistical distributions of the wind direction and speed along the routes must be performed such a study is presented in tillig et al 2019 but it requires higher computational efforts since many points must be evaluated another possibility to reduce the uncertainty from the weather conditions is to use the method presented in section 4 1 but with measurement intervals longer than one year this will result in a more certain prediction of the long term fuel savings but will not provide the standard deviations as the method presented in tillig et al 2019 does it can be concluded that the largest uncertainties in the performance prediction using shipclean relate to the prediction of the lift and drag forces of a ship at a drift angle the source of the largest uncertainty for the prediction of the expected fuel savings is the weather conditions the ship will experience 5 conclusions the paper presented a continued development of a ship performance model called shipclean which is a ship energy system model that can be used to predict the performance of generic cargo ships the emphasis of the development presented in this study was on the detailed description of the modeling of wind assisted propulsion accounting for various interaction effects such as between the sails and the superstructure and other hydrodynamic effects the major conclusions of the study are that it is possible to predict with acceptable accuracy the performance of wind assisted cargo ships with very limited input information and in short computational time and large fuel savings can be achieved using flettner rotors on ships the theory of the new models implemented in shipclean that describe wind assisted propulsion were presented in detail together with other hydrodynamic effects that need to be included for sailing ships the flettner rotor sail was used as the main wind assisted technology of interest in several cases for two ship types a tanker and a roro the interaction between flettner rotors was modeled using potential flow theory the results showed that the total thrust was only slightly affected by the presence of other rotors however since some rotors gained and others suffered in performance the location of the center of effort was highly influenced by the interaction thus it was concluded that interaction effects between sails must be considered for wind assisted ships the sail module in shipclean was verified against model and full scale measurements as well as cfd results it was shown that for a single flettner rotor the lift and drag coefficients in the full scale measurements were considerably higher than those obtained by cfd computations or in model tests further it was shown that the method to predict the aerodynamic interaction effects shows good agreement with the trends of the thrust and side force coefficients measured in model tests for two flettner rotors the scope of the interaction effects related to the number of sails their positions ship type etc were difficult to generalize it is therefore recommended to engage in several specific scenario based analyses to understand how large interaction effects need to be to find a recommended or optimum condition setup for the ship type and route of interest thus many flettner rotor configurations and simulations were carried out which showed that the arrangement of the rotors on the ship influences the overall performance an effect that is only possible to capture if interaction effects are respected this finding highlighted the need for an additional model that enabled rpm control for the rotors due to interaction effects the results with this additional model showed large gains in performance if each rotor s rpm was optimized for the local wind speed the local wind angle the ships drift angle and the rudder angle additional savings of approximately 2 5 were achieved with the rpm control compared to if the rotors are operated at the optimum sr for the local wind speed and angle these findings show the complexity in the energy system of a ship and motivate using an energy systems based ship performance analysis model that accounts for interaction effects between sails a comparison of results from several model tests and empirical methods showed large discrepancies in the predicted lift and drag force of a hull sailing at a drift angle in this study low aspect ratio wing theory is applied to ship hulls a comparison was made between simulation results and model tests which led to the conclusion that wing theory is able to model the lift and drag more accurately than the empirical method but that the hull form of a ship has a large impact on the actual lift and drag of a ship it is concluded from an uncertainty study that an accurate prediction of the lift to drag relation of a ship hull sailing at a drift angle is more important than the accurate prediction of the drift angle simulations with realistic weather conditions and two example ships showed the versatility and applicability of the developed methods the results showed potential savings of up to 30 for a tanker with 6 flettner rotors on a pacific ocean route for a roro on the baltic sea the potential savings are shown to be approximately 14 with 4 flettner rotors from the study it was concluded that the arrangement and position of the rotors have a large impact on the ship s performance and fuel savings comparing results from the tanker and the roro it was concluded that the optimal arrangement differs largely depending on the ship design speed and weather conditions along the route credit authorship contribution statement fabian tillig

21715,this study presents a novel approach to analytically capture aero and hydrodynamic interaction effects on wind assisted ships low aspect ratio wing theory is applied and modified to be used for

s 1 introduction to limit the consequences of climate change society must dramatically reduce co2 emissions which are a major driver of climate change anderson and bows 2011 with its large share of worldwide transport shipping accounts for approximately 3 of global co2 emissions the imo set a goal to halve the emissions of the world s fleet by 2050 compared to the 2008 level o and 2018 online avai 2018 at the same time forecasts show a doubling of the transport needs by 2050 which has caused the world s shipping fleet to grow cutting the emissions of a growing fleet requires drastic measures and savings for each ship far exceeding the 50 decrease targeted for the entire fleet such a decrease in emissions cannot be achieved with conventional fuels combustion engines and ship designs alternative and complementary propulsion systems have become a focus of research in recent years one such alternative is wind assisted propulsion using e g flettner rotors as shown for a tanker in fig 1 although the implementation of wind assisted propulsion in shipping is not without challenges the large potential savings make it a viable solution concerning the environment and the economy rehmatulla et al 2017 numerous studies have focused on the economics and general fuel savings of such systems ballnii et al 2017 talluri et al 2018 tillig and ringsberg 2018 van der kolk et al 2019a showing that wind assisted propulsion can significantly lower fuel consumption and emissions however these studies have also shown that the economics highly depend on wind conditions ship types and shipping routes although several different wind propulsion technologies have been assessed the most realistic options seem to be fixed wing sails or variants combinations of wing sails with or without flaps rotor sails and kites traut et al 2014 lu and ringsberg 2019 in traut et al 2014 the propulsive power contribution of a single flettner rotor is compared with the power contribution from a kite showing that the average savings with the single flettner rotor are higher than with the kite in viola et al 2015 wing sails with flaps and twist control were applied to a tanker and the results showed considerable power contributions that could save fuel the general characteristics of flettner rotors have been widely studied by both cfd and model tests li et al 2012 bordogna et al 2019 the potential savings of flettner rotors applied to ships were shown in searcy 2017 for domestic shipping in tillig and ringsberg 2018 for a baltic sea route in tillig et al 2019 for an atlantic triangular route and in bentin et al 2016 for a trans atlantic route all these studies show large potential savings and economic feasibility for flettner rotors while considering the installation and maintenance costs depending on the route the ship type and the number of rotors fuel savings approaching 40 have been reported with such potential savings and the ease of operation flettner rotors are one of the most promising propulsion alternatives for lowering shipping emissions unlike the thrust from a propeller the total force of a sail does not act along a ship s longitudinal axis all sails produce a lift force perpendicular to the inflow and a drag force parallel to the inflow these lift and drag forces can be transformed into a thrust in the ship s longitudinal direction and a side force perpendicular to the ship the side forces are much larger than the wind loads that are typically experienced by ships and must be compensated by a drift angle of the hull and a rudder angle both of which create added resistance to accurately predict the savings from wind assisted propulsion it is thus crucial to perform a four degrees of freedom 4 dof analysis of the ship i e predict the yaw and heel moments thrust and drift of the ship for the performance prediction of the ship it is crucial to predict the added resistance from the rudder which must compensate the yaw moment induced by the sails and the added resistance due to drift which appear due to the large side forces from the sails additionally it is important to include the roll of the ship since especially slender ships can experience large heel angles due to the sails a heel angle also introduces yaw moments from the sails due to the transversal shift of the thrust force and reduces the sail forces due to the reduced projected sail area the importance of a systems perspective including interaction effects in between the sails and between the sails and the hull i e rudder angle and drift is discussed in viola et al 2015 van der kolk et al 2019b in yacht sailing models considering the sail and hydrodynamic forces that predict the performance of yachts are called velocity prediction programs vpps and they are widely used to compare and predict the performance of sailing yachts in shipping such vpps are not yet common an approach towards a vpp was presented in tillig and ringsberg 2018 van der kolk et al 2019a viola et al 2015 however the main challenges remain quantifying the aerodynamic interaction and the hydrodynamics of ships sailing at a drift angle in viola et al 2015 lee et al 2016 the aerodynamic interaction effects were evaluated using time consuming cfd computations while the model in van der kolk et al 2019a was based on model tests typically the hydrodynamics of a hull are based on empirical methods from maneuvering research as in tillig and ringsberg 2018 viola et al 2015 or on cfd or model test results using standard series hulls van der kolk et al 2019b van der kolk 2016 this study presents the continued development of a ship energy system model called shipclean which was presented in tillig and ringsberg 2018 the new developments relate to modules in the shipclean model which have been added to include the aerodynamic interaction effects and better represent the hydrodynamics of a ship sailing at a drift angle additionally a novel approach to individually optimize the rpm of each flettner rotor in an array installed on a ship is presented the study focuses on the application of flettner rotors because of their great potential for fuel savings and ease of operation see the former references above to predict the feasibility and the potential savings of flettner rotors on a large amount of different ships on different routes and to be able to perform optimizations of flettner rotors on a ship a simulation model must i be generic i e require only a very limited amount of information about the ship and ii require low computational efforts with these requirements the employed methods must rely on empirical or analytical formulations that together form a methodology and simulation model with known and acceptable prediction accuracy cfd computations cannot be used for this purpose due to their computational effort and model tests especially for the rotors cannot cover all possible arrangements and conditions for flettner rotors on a ship however the shipclean model satisfies the above requirements it is a simulation model specifically developed to provide accurate performance predictions with very limited input data with short computational time thus being applicable to extensive studies as described above the article is divided into three main parts in section 2 the shipclean model is described the theory of aerodynamic interaction and hydrodynamic lift and drag as well as the implementation in shipclean are discussed in section 3 section 4 discusses the operation retrofitting and new design of wind assisted propelled ships using examples with a tanker on a pacific ocean route and a roro on a baltic sea route including the presentation of the rpm control of the rotors a qualitative discussion of uncertainties of the predictions of the fuel savings is presented in section 4 5 followed by the conclusions of the study in section 5 2 the shipclean model the shipclean model is a ship performance prediction model based on analytical and empirical methods as well as on propeller and hull standard series programmed in matlab mathworks 2020 the model is developed following a modularized approach i e each part of the model is represented by a module which can easily be replaced or new modules can be added all parts of the model are described in detail in tillig and ringsberg 2018 and tillig et al 2017 in tillig et al 2018 uncertainties in the prediction are analyzed and quantified an overview of the model is shown in fig 2 the focus of the model development was that predictions should be available without numerous input data e g the hull form and exact geometry of the ship shall not be necessary for a performance prediction thus the data needed for a power prediction are the main dimensions loa b t δ the design speed the ship type and the propeller rpm the remaining dimensions such as the lpp depth and superstructure dimensions are estimated by the model using empirical formulas the lpp is estimated based on empirical bulb lengths and lengths of the ship aft of ap the height of the superstructure is based on estimations of the number decks and the length is depending on the size and type of the ship as an example pctc and ferries are assumed to have superstructure lengths equal to their lpp tankers are assumed to have a superstructure length of 1 7th of their lpp details about the estimation of the ship dimensions are presented in tillig 2017 to predict the performance in real operation conditions the true wind speed and angle twa tws currents and water temperature must be specified wave heights and directions can be specified or evaluated to match the wind speed a specified fetch and the wind direction in tillig and ringsberg 2018 the shipclean model was extended compared to tillig et al 2017 2018 to handle 4 degrees of freedom 4 dof which was proven to be crucial for accurately predicting the performance of wind assisted propelled ships a detailed description of forces and moments acting on a wind assisted propelled ship was presented in tillig and ringsberg 2018 the focus when analyzing wind assisted propulsion is on accurately predicting the delivered thrust of the sails and the hydrodynamic compensation of the side forces created by the sails the forces and moments on a wind assisted ship can be divided into two groups i aerodynamic forces and moments i e wind loads on the hull and superstructure as well as the sail forces and the resulting moments and ii hydrodynamic forces and moments i e drag and lift forces on the hull as well as rudder drag and lift forces and the resulting moments the resistance of the hull is divided into calm water resistance added resistance due to shallow water added resistance due to waves added resistance from fouling added resistance from ice and added resistance due to drift additionally the course and speed over ground are corrected for influences from ocean currents a complete description of the employed methods can be found in tillig and ringsberg 2018 tillig et al 2017 2018 since only the steady state condition is evaluated in shipclean the sum of all forces and moments in each of the 4 dofs must be zero see tillig and ringsberg 2018 for a complete description of the 4 dof method in shipclean 1 f x f y n k 0 in addition to the surge drift and yaw must be respected due to the high side forces and potentially high yaw moments that wind assisted propulsion introduces the consideration of the roll of the ship is crucial since heel angles can become large for slender ships with large sail areas and thus sail forces must be limited additionally the projected area of the sails is reduced due to the heel angle reducing the sail forces and the thrust force from the sails are shifted transversely which causes a yaw moment since the forces and moments in the different directions are dependent on each other e g the rudder drag is dependent on the propeller thrust the drift angle and the rudder side force equation 1 can only be solved iteratively for a given sail force e g given rpms of the installed flettner rotors the rudder angle drift angle heel angle and propeller thrust are iterated to achieve the force and moment balance the starting point of the iteration is found by solving equation 1 without the dependencies between forces and moments of different directions i e the rudder forces are assumed independent of the propeller thrust and the resistance and sail forces independent of the heel and drift angles additionally a novel rpm control iterates the rpm of each single rotor to minimize the required propeller thrust the optimization is performed by stepwise reducing the rpm of selected rotors from the optimal rpm for the wind angle and speed the selection of the rotor to reduce in power is performed using a scoring system see section 4 2 1 for details since the shipclean model is based solely on empirical analytical and interpolation methods the computational time is significantly shorter than for models based on cfd the evaluation of one weather condition for one target speed including the hydro and aerodynamic interaction see section 3 reefing section 4 2 and involuntary speed loss takes approximately 10 s on a standard desktop pc without sails this computational time reduces to less than 1 s the shipclean model was verified against a model test with different ship types in tillig et al 2018 and full scale measurements of a cruise ferry with a flettner rotor installed in norsepower 2019a the results presented in tillig et al 2018 norsepower 2019a show very good agreement between the performance prediction using shipclean and the model and full scale measurements 2 1 the flettner rotor model in shipclean the force generated by a flettner rotor on board a ship is divided into a lift force l acting perpendicular to the local apparent wind direction and a drag force d acting in line with the local wind direction with the local apparent wind direction the lift and drag forces can be converted into thrust t and side s forces as expressed in equations 2 and 3 2 t d cos a w a l sin a w a 3 s d sin a w a l cos a w a all forces are expressed using force coefficients as defined by equation 4 4 c i i 0 5 ρ a a w s 2 i l d t s since the flettner rotors are rotated using electric motors the power consumption must be respected in the performance prediction the power consumption is expressed using a power coefficient cp as defined by equation 5 5 c p p r o t o r 0 5 ρ a a w s 3 the lift and drag force coefficients of a flettner rotor depend on the spin ratio the aspect ratio of the rotor and the size of the disc at the top the spin ratio is defined as the ratio between the local wind speed u in equation 6 and the rotor s tangential speed at the surface 6 s r v t u ω r r u in shipclean the lift and drag coefficients are valid for rotors with an aspect ratio of ar 6 and with a disc diameter twice the rotor s diameter the coefficients are based on the results in li et al 2012 but corrected to better match the full scale measurements see section 3 4 c l 0 0046 sr 5 0 1145 sr 4 0

section 3 the forces and power consumption are analyzed for several rotational speeds at different heights the initial rotational speed for one rotor is defined as the condition with the maximal net

angle the resistance and the rudder angle reefing might be applied in the form of a reduced spin ratio to one or several rotors reefing and general operation of the rotors are described in section 4 3 aero and hydrodynamic interaction effects to improve the methods presented in tillig and ringsberg 2018 for wind assisted propulsion the following sections focus on the interaction effects between sails the superstructure and the hull of wind assisted ships new improved methods for the prediction of the sail thrust and side force as well as for the lift and drag generated by a ship sailing at a drift angle are developed and presented 3 1 coordinate systems two coordinate systems are introduced one fixed to the ship hull x y z and one flow oriented fixed to the course through water x y z note that the course and speed corrections for ocean currents are performed prior to the analysis presented in this work i e twa tws and u are corrected for the influence of the ocean current the coordinate systems with the definition of the drift and rudder angles are shown in fig 3 the twa and the wave encounter angle are defined counterclockwise off the bow i e an angle of zero degrees represents head wind waves the force and moment balance according to equation 1 is done in the flow oriented main coordinate system x y z therefore forces from the ship fixed coordinate system must be

mean wind speed i e the interaction of the wind and the earth s surface or a ship s deck friction between the moving air and the earth s surface causes the wind speed to be lower the closer it is towards the earth causing a boundary layer with characteristic wind speed profiles the boundary layer thickness and shape are mainly influenced by the turbulence in the air and the shape roughness of the surface the wind speed gradient can be described by kaltschmitt et al 2007 14 t w s h t w s 10 h h 10 α where tws10 is the wind speed at a height of 10 m h10 and α is the hellmann coefficient which is dependent on the surface of the earth and the turbulence of the wind at the point of interest this wind speed gradient causes a shear of the apparent wind angle over the height of a sail on board a ship in this study two conditions are of interest i the wind above the ocean surface which is low in turbulence and stable due to the long fetch and ii the wind above the ship s deck which due to the short fetch is unstable according to garzon and figueroa 2017 the hellmann coefficient for stable air above the open water surface and unstable air above human inhabited areas is 0 27 which is chosen here for both abovementioned conditions the apparent wind speed and angles above the ship s deck are estimated in two steps first the apparent wind angle and apparent wind speed at 10 m height above the sea surface are computed using the true wind speed gradient over the sea surface as well as the true wind angle the ship s speed and drift angle second the apparent wind speed profile above the ship s deck is estimated using equation 14 with the assumption that the wind speed at 10 m above the deck is equivalent to the wind speed at the corresponding height i e deck height 10 m above the sea surface fig 4 shows the apparent wind angles and speeds at different heights of a rotor sail both the wind angle and the wind speed highly depend on the height above the deck for a 30 m rotor sail the speed is 60 higher at the top compared to the bottom while the wind angle is 3 larger these numbers show the importance of twist control of sails that require a certain angle of attack for specified wind speeds such as wing sails it must be noted that these angles are without the wind shear in the true wind that can be present and increase the differences flettner rotors are not sensitive to the angle of attack however the rpm of the rotors must be optimized considering the wind speed and angle distributions since the thrust and side forces of the rotor depend on the local wind angle for this reason the forces power consumption and moments of the sails are evaluated for several different rpms at each considered height the maximum of the sum of the net power at each height see equation 10 i e the thrust power minus the consumed power specifies the optimal rpm for the actual condition the optimal rpms might be reduced later in the energy balance calculation in shipclean due to the need to reduce the sail forces as described in section 4 1 and 4 2 3 3 sail sail interaction the influence of sails on the flow field across a ship s deck can be divided into two parts i a potential part i e a circulation that is induced into the flow field and ii a viscous part i e a wake and turbulence caused by flow separation and free vortices the induced circulation i e the potential flow influence results in a change in local wind speeds and directions across the ship and thus different wind conditions for each sail a schematic presentation of the potential flow around a rotating cylinder is presented in fig 5 including the lift force l drag force d tangential speed vt rotational speed ω and circulation г in garzon and figueroa 2017 the potential flow interaction effects are solved analytically for an array of flettner rotors assuming a pure horizontal flow in the x y plane and defining the two boundary conditions as i the induced velocity at infinity is 0 and ii the induced speed at the rotor surface is equal to the tangential speed vt the navier stokes equation can be simplified to an analytical solution of the flow pattern created by a single rotor garzon and figueroa 2017 the vx in the x direction and vy in the y direction components of the induced flows from the rotating cylinders can be computed by garzon and figueroa 2017 with rr as the radius of the rotor and vt the induced velocity due to the circulation 15 v x x y v t r r x 2 y 2 cos arctan y x 16 v y x y v t r r x 2 y 2 sin arctan y x in equations 15 and 16 the rotor is assumed to be placed in the origin of the coordinate system since the solution is linear the solution of an array of rotors is represented by the sum of the induced flow from each single rotor given that the offsets from the coordinate center are considered for each rotor the induced velocity at the rotor radius can be computed using the circulation г which according to the biot sawert s law can be expressed by houghton et al 2017 17 γ 2 π r r v t the circulation г can be evaluated using known lift coefficients e g from model tests and the kutta joukowsky theorem abbot and von doenhoff 1959 for the lift per unit span l with u as the inflow velocity 18 l ρ u γ 19 l c l ρ 2 u 2 c this method can be used for any type of sail for sails such as flettner rotors a more accurate relation between the lift coefficient and the circulation is given in swanson 1961 as 20 c l 1 r r r c γ r r u sin γ 2 π r r r c γ r r u 2 here the term r r r c stands for the relation between the radius of the rotor rr and the distance to the external vortex rc and γ describes the location of the external vortex swanson 1961 unfortunately r r r c and γ cannot be found analytically in swanson 1961 for spin ratios between 1 and 4 good agreement with the model test results was obtained with r r r c 0 25 and γ 210 in fig 6 a the angular speed of a flettner rotor with 5 m diameter and 30 m height is compared to the angular speed of the fluid computed from the circulation according to equation 20 additionally in fig 6b the angular speed computed from the circulation according to equation 20 is compared to the angular speed according to equation 18 the circulation reaches a maximum at a spin ratio of approximately 4 fig 6a shows that the angular speed computed from equation 20 is slightly higher than the speed computed from equation 18 since equation 20 proposed in swanson 1961 is specifically for flettner rotors it is used in this study for other sail types such as wing sails the formulation in equations 18 and 19 can be used to predict the interactions according to equations 15 and 16 equations 15 20 can be solved analytically to calculate the flow field in an array of flettner rotors however since the optimal rpm of a rotor depends on the local wind speed and angle and the induced velocities depend on the rotor s rpm an iteration is required to achieve the flow field respecting the optimal rpm of each rotor note that in this stage the optimal rpm is calculated without respecting the drift and rudder forces which are first included in the rpm optimization see section 4 1 1 to visualize the interaction effects a tanker with 4 flettner rotors 5 m in diameter and 30 m high is studied at a ship speed vs of 12 kn and a tws of 12 m s the rotors are arranged in a rectangular array with a longitudinal distance of 61 2 m and a transverse distance of 25 8 m see fig 7 the induced flow field according to equations 15 and 16 is shown for a twa of 65 awa 45 aws 16 5 m s additionally the wind angles and wind speeds experienced by each of the rotors are shown both the wind angle and the wind speed experienced by each rotor are highly influenced by the presence of the other rotors thus the thrust and side force coefficients and optimal rpm must be evaluated respecting the local wind speed and angle naturally the pattern of the wind angles and wind speeds for each rotor correspond to those experienced by sail boats on different positions in a fleet race bethwaite 2013 the viscous interactions are comprised of a wake i e areas of low wind speed due to flow separation and free vortices created by the rotors in bordogna et al 2020 it is shown from flow measurements in model tests that the wake behind a cylinder diminishes as it spins this indicates that there should not be any wakes behind flettner rotors however in e g bethwaite 2013 it is presented that sail boats further downwind in a fleet of racing sail boats experience lower wind speeds and high turbulence in the air since every sail creates tip vortices depending on the generated lift it is most likely that such vortices influence the air flow to the sails further downwind in the horizontal plane tip vortices are following the potential streamlines however the vertical path i e the height of the vortices and the diameter are more difficult to predict without flow measurements or cfd computations in shipclean the focus is on fast predictions of the performance of wind assisted ships without requiring detailed information to e g enable easy weather routing thus cfd computations cannot be used but eventual performance penalties due to turbulent air or free vortices must be captured to reduce the performance of sails downwind of another sail the wind speed is reduced in an area with a width of the chord length or diameter for flettner rotors along the potential streamlines downwind of a sail in shipclean a standard wind speed reduction of 5 compared to the local wind speed including the potential influences is applied a visualization of the sum of all flow influences is presented in fig 8 note that the flow reduction due to the viscous interactions in fig 8 is exaggerated and set to 15 to better visualize the vortex paths additionally the deck house and its influence on the flow is visible as a rectangle in the left side of fig 8 the interactions caused by the superstructure are further discussed in section 3 4 in fig 9 the thrust from the rotors arranged according to fig 7 is shown for twa from 0 to 360 including the potential a and viscous flow b interaction effects for the latter case the wind speed reduction is exaggerated and set to 15 to better visualize the impact all rotors are operated at the maximum net thrust point it can clearly be seen that the forward rotors i e numbers 1 and 4 largely benefit from the interaction with the other rotors while rotors 2 and 3 suffer the decrease in performance for rotors in a vortex path can be seen for rotor 1 at approximately 120 twa approximately 90 awa and for rotor 4 at approximately 240 twa approximately 270 awa additionally rotor 2 is in the path of rotor 4 at approximately 20 awa while rotor 3 is in the path of rotor 1 at approximately 340 awa without the viscous interaction the total thrust from all four rotors is slightly higher less than 1 if computed with potential interaction compared to the thrust without interaction this increase can be explained by the circulation that is built up around the array of rotors comparable to the circulation around the head and main sail of a yacht bethwaite 2013 it must be noted that the side forces created by the sails are also increased due to the flow interactions during the rpm optimization see section 4 2 1 rotor 1 is often reefed reduced rpm due to the high side forces it creates comparing the results with and without flow interaction the center of effort of the side force differs by 6 30 with the center of effort evaluated with interaction effects being further forward this difference has a large impact on the overall performance of the ship due to the interaction effects with the hull see section 3 5 furthermore reliable rpm control of the rotors see section 4 2 1 is only possible if the local wind speed and angle are estimated both the rpm control and the difference of the center of effort prove it crucial to include aerodynamic interaction effects when evaluating the performance of wind assisted propulsion with more than one sail installed on the ship it must be concluded that the dominating part of the aerodynamic interaction is potential part i e the induced circulation causing a change of the local wind speeds and angles furthermore the results of the simulated aerodynamic interactions and the forces generated by the flettner rotors are verified against model and full scale measurements in section 3 5 3 4 sail superstructure interaction the presence of working sails ahead or behind a superstructure changes the angle and velocity of the inflow the local wind speed and angle at the position of the superstructure are calculated using the method described in section 3 3 an example is presented in fig 7 additionally the superstructure can affect the sails if a sail occurs in the upstream vortex or in the downstream wake meroney 1985 however this will only occur in a small range of wind angles such as close to stern wind and close to head wind both of which are not favorable conditions for sailing the model described below is thus simplified and only intended to capture the decrease of forces of the idling rotors for the above conditions as shown in meroney 1985 the upstream vortex only affects an area of the height of less than 1 3 of the superstructure height and extends less than half of the height forward thus the upstream vortex is neglected in this study the downstream wake is modeled using a sinusoidal reduction of the wind speed from zero at the superstructure until it reaches the free wind speed at a distance equal to 20 times the height of the superstructure this agrees with the measured wake behind buildings in meroney 1985 the wake behind the superstructure is visualized in fig 8 3 5 verification of the aerodynamic forces the sail module of shipclean i e the formulations to calculate the lift and drag as well as the method to evaluate aerodynamic interactions have been compared to results from cfd model tests and full scale measurements in a first step the lift drag and power coefficients of a single flettner rotor are compared between i full scale measurements ii shipclean simulations iii cfd results from li et al 2012 kramer et al 2016 and iv model test results from bordogna et al 2020 the full scale measurements were collected on board a cruise ferry with a single 4 24m flettner rotor installed norsepower 2019a the total thrust and side force were measured using force transducers at the foundation of the rotors the power needed to rotate the rotor was measured as the power consumption of the electric motor installed for the rotor wind speed and angle were measured with the ship s own instruments measurements were only taken in static sailing conditions i e constant ship speed and heading fig 10 presents the results from the comparison for the analysis the wind speed profile as presented in section 3 2 is applied to calculate the wind speed experienced by the flettner rotor since no data filtering was applied the results from the full scale measurements show some scatter however clear clusters of measurement results can be found for both the lift and drag coefficients and the power coefficients the comparison in fig 10a shows that the lift coefficient in the full scale measurement is considerably higher than the lift coefficient predicted in li et al 2012 and measured in model scale in bordogna et al 2020 at a spin ratio of sr 3 for example the results from bordogna et al 2020 show a lift coefficient of about 6 5 the results from li et al 2012 about 8 5 and the shipclean simulations of the full scale measurements give a lift coefficient of about 9 5 it must be noted that the aspect ratio of the rotors in bordogna et al 2020 is ar 5 compared to ar 6 in the full scale measurements and in li et al 2012 kramer et al 2016 in the study presented in bordogna et al 2020 tests at different reynolds numbers re were performed the results indicate a considerable scale effect with the lift forces increasing with increasing reynolds number this could explain the higher measured lift forces in full scale fig 10b shows that the results of the drag coefficient align well for spin ratios larger than 1 at sr lower than one the shipclean simulations give lower values at a spin ratio of sr 0 5 the shipclean simulation gives a value of about 0 3 while the full and model scale measurements show values of about 0 5 0 8 this underprediction will reduce the penalties of installed flettner rotors in head wind fig 10c shows that the power coefficient in kramer et al 2016 underestimates the actual measured power in full scale this is expected since the results in kramer et al 2016 do not include any losses due to friction in the bearings or losses in the electrical motor it must be noted that the lift drag and power coefficients generally show worse agreement at high spin ratios however in typical operation a spin ratio of around 1 5 2 5 is often optimal in this range the different methods and results agree better in a second step the sail interaction was verified by comparing the performance of two flettner rotors placed along the longitudinal axis with a distance of 3 rotor diameters the forward rotor was denoted as rotor a the tested conditions are summarized in table 1 results of the shipclean simulation and from the model tests in bordogna et al 2020 are presented in fig 11 a for case a and fig 11b for case b from fig 11 it can be concluded that the thrust coefficients from measurements and shipclean predictions show similar trends in beating conditions the thrust coefficient is significantly reduced up to 38 according to measurements at 30 awa in case a in reaching conditions the thrust coefficient is increased with up to 7 for case b the side force coefficients are increased in most conditions due to the interaction effects for case a the shipclean predictions are lower than the model test results for beating conditions but do not include the sudden decrease of side force shown in the measurement results at around 120 awa as discussed in bordogna et al 2020 model test results also include significant uncertainties which might cause this sudden decrease alternatively some effects are not captured by the method in shipclean for case b shipclean overpredicts the influences on the side force when compared to the model tests results for case b and an awa of 90 shipclean shows an increase of the side force with 11 compared to the 5 in the measurement results it must be kept in mind that the flettner rotors in shipclean and in the model tests have different aspect ratios and different lift and drag coefficients see fig 10 since the potential flow interactions are coupled to the induced circulation which is coupled to the lift generation of the flettner rotors this difference will influence the absolute values in the comparison from the results it must be concluded that the method presented in section 3 3 shows good agreement with the trends for the thrust and side force when compared to model test results the side force might be overpredicted which leads to a somewhat conservative prediction of the total performance of a ship it must further be noted that the presented results are for rotors at a fixed sr related to the free stream velocity as discussed in section 3 3 the differences in total performance can be much smaller than the difference shown here since the rotors can be operated at an optimal spin ratio for the local wind speed and angle 3 6 sail hull interaction since the sails introduce large side forces on the ship the main concern in the hydrodynamic interaction between the sails and the hull is the compensation of the introduced side force by drifting and rudder forces the distribution of the side force between the rudder and the hull is coupled to the superstructure and the position of the rotors since the rudder must compensate for the yaw moment introduced by the windage and the sails the lift and drag forces are computed by 21 l c l ρ 2 u 2 l p p t 22 d c d ρ 2 u 2 l p p t the rudder forces can be computed using basic wing theory which in shipclean is implemented by the formulas given in bertram 2000 23 x r c d v s 2 ρ 2 a r t 1 1 1 c t h 1 cos δ r 24 y r c l v s 2 ρ 2 a r t 1 1 1 c t h s i n δ r 25 c l 2 π a r a r 0 7 a r 1 7 2 s i n δ r s i n δ r s i n δ r c o s δ r 26 c d c l 2 π a r s i n δ r 3 the rudder angle δr is the corrected angle to account for the drift of the ship and the flow straightening from the aft body kijima et al 1990 27 δ r δ γ r β 28 γ r 22 2 c b b l p p 2 0 02 c b b l p p 0 68 to verify and adjust a method to evaluate the lift and drag of a ship hull at drift three sets of model test results are used in this study i model tests of a series 60 hull reported in longo and stern 2002 ii model tests and cfd computations of a series of hulls with different block coefficients hull 1 cb 0 72 hull 16 cb 0 83 and hull 19 cb 0 64 reported in van der kolk et al 2019b and iii model tests of a tanker reported in kume et al 2006 it must be noted that the side force moment and the induced resistance at small drift angles are small values compared to the ship s resistance thus large deviations can be expected as discussed and shown in kume et al 2006 in kume et al 2006 the standard deviations for the resistance side force and moment were evaluated to be approximately 3 5 keeping in mind that the measured resistance includes the resistance without drift which will increase the uncertainty of the induced resistance in van der kolk et al 2019b it has been shown that the difference between simulation results and model test results is the largest for the induced drag it should also be noted that side forces and added resistances are often given in the ship fixed coordinate system and must thus be converted to the lift and drag forces in the flow oriented coordinate system which is used in this study the side force and drag due to drift are often estimated using empirical methods for maneuvering e g according to inoue and hirano 1987 however as shown in fig 12 the side force is highly overpredicted up to 400 when using this method compared to the data presented in van der kolk et al 2019b kijima et al 1990 longo and stern 2002 thus the method proposed in inoue and hirano 1987 is found unsuitable for the analysis of the static sailing condition of wind assisted propelled ships fig 12 also shows that hull 16 of the delft series has significantly higher lift forces than the other two hulls in the series even though the only difference is the block coefficient to analyze the hydrodynamic response of wind assisted propelled ships three parameters are crucial i the hydrodynamic lift ii the hydrodynamic drag and iii the center of effort of the lift force as explained in sections 1 and 2 the shipclean model is intended to provide fast predictions with a very limited input i e only the main dimensions of a ship thus more sophisticated methods for the prediction of the abovementioned force and moment parameters such as the method in hooft 1996 or cfd computations cannot be applied since the hull form is unknown and the computations would be too time consuming alternative methods could be to i build up data bases of results with standard series hulls using model tests ii cfd computations or iii to apply theoretical methods using only the main parameters of the hull which is done in this study the following section describes in detail how the side force drag and yaw moment are evaluated using wing theory for small aspect ratio wings low aspect ratio ar wings are defined as wings with ar 4 hoerner 1985 cargo ships have aspect ratios draft to length ratios of well below one and are thus suitable to be analyzed with the low aspect ratio wing theory according to the theory for the lift and drag of low aspect ratio as presented in hoerner 1985 the potential flow lift and induced drag are only influenced by the efficient aspect ratio of the wing the relation between the aspect ratio and the efficient aspect ratio depends mainly on the rounding of the edges i e the bilge radius and the planform additionally a cross flow drag is considerable for small aspect ratio wings in summary one goal of the study is to relate the lift and drag of a hull to its aspect ratio and possibly the block coefficient or main frame area coefficient 3 6 1 limitations of the model the presented model implemented in shipclean can only be applied on drift angles where there is circulatory lift i e below the angle of maximum lift in hoerner 1985 it was shown that this angle is expected to be 20 40 for aspect ratios close to those of ships which is much higher than reasonable drift angles for static ship operations in van der kolk 2016 inoue and hirano 1987 it was discussed that the wave pattern affects the lift and drag of a ship hull however the low aspect ratio wing theory does not account for two phase flows thus these effects will not be captured unless the coefficients can be related to the residual resistance cr as discussed in houghton et al 2017 hooft 1996 the form of the leading edge of a wing section bow shape the planform shape lateral plan and edges bilge have a significant influence on the lift and drag characteristics due to the limited and simplified input to the shipclean model such hull form features are unknown i e not required as input and thus cannot be considered unless the effects can be related to form parameters such as the block prismatic or main frame area coefficient due to the nature of shipclean the ships are assumed to be of conventional shape e g have a full lateral plan 3 6 2 hydrodynamic lift forces of the hull to estimate the lift and drag of the hull at a drift angle in a more theoretical way two approaches can be used the lifting line wing theory or the slender body theory the slender body theory is often applied to cylinder shapes e g in jorgensen 1973 and barros et al 2008 it was shown that the slender body theory well predicts the lift force of cylinders with small aspect ratios however the induced drag is underpredicted especially for small drift angles it is thus not suitable for the modeling of large ships with wind assisted propulsion thus in this study wing theory for low aspect ratio wings is applied on ships sailing at a drift angle according to hoerner 1985 the lift coefficient of a low aspect ratio wing ar 1 is composed of a linear cl1 and a nonlinear cl2 part 29 c l c l 1 c l 2 30 c l 1 1 δ b b 2 0 5 π a r sin β 31 c l 2 k sin β sin β cos β the term 1 δ b b 2 in equation 30 represents the decrease of the aspect ratio due to rounded edges of a low aspect ratio wing hoerner 1985 for wings with a rounded plan form and rounded lateral edges this might be set equal to 0 78 hoerner 1985 the factor k in equation 31 represents the cross flow drag coefficient hooft 1996 which depends on the shape of the wing and can be compared to the cross flow drag coefficient described in hooft 1996 it was argued in hoerner 1985 that the 2d profile of the wing and the thickness ratio have a minor effect on the lift coefficient but that the main effect is from the planform and the shape of the edges i e sharp or rounded edges in van der kolk 2016 it was discussed that cl2 is mainly dependent on the vortices created along the bilge of a ship and thus highly dependent on hull form features such as bilge radius and the shape of the aftbody skeg using the measured lift coefficients of the three sample hulls the factor k is evaluated and the results are shown in fig 13 the calculated k values in fig 13 decrease with increasing drift angle for hull 16 of the delft series and the tanker increase for the series 60 and hull 19 of the delft series and is constant for hull 1 of the delft series an increasing k value could motivate the linear part to be overpredicted and vice versa however from fig 13 no conclusions can be drawn about any dependency of the linear part on the ship s parameters e g the delft hull 16 and the series 60 hull are very similar in aspect ratio thickness ratio b lpp and block coefficient but show the opposite behavior in fig 13 it should be noted that the delft hull series does not have any aft body skeg thus the lateral area will increase with increasing block coefficient which certainly will influence the lift and drag according to the theory presented in hoerner 1985 the value of k should highly depend on the shape and rounding of the edges i e the bilge radius if this would be the case for ships it should be correlated to the block coefficient ships with low block coefficients have a higher bilge radius and should thus have a lower k value in contrast to this theory the quadratic part of the side force can be determined according to inoue and hirano 1987 32 y v v 0 244 6 67 1 c b t d b 0 05 increasing with decreasing block coefficient the mean value of the evaluated k value from the model tests is shown in fig 14 from these results no dependency of k on the block coefficient can be derived since it is not possible to detect a dependency of the value of k which is related to the cross flow drag on any of the typical hull parameters such as length to draft length to beam beam to draft or block coefficient it must be concluded that the k value highly depends on local hull form features as discussed in van der kolk 2016 consequently since the hull form is not mimicked in shipclean the average value of k shown in fig 14 is then used for the prediction of the side force 33 c l c l 1 c l 2 0 8 0 5 π a r sin β 0 6541 sin β sin β cos β the k value of 0 6541 is as expected much lower than the theoretical value of 2 for a flat plate hoerner 1985 as it is presented in fig 14 the k can differ significantly between different ships this introduces uncertainties in the prediction of the drift angle however since the crossflow force is also included in the drag calculation using the same k value see section 3 5 3 the lift to drag ratio is less affected a comparison of the measured and the predicted lift coefficient is presented in fig 15 a the prediction according to equation 33 gives a 30 lower lift coefficient than the measurements for the series 60 hull and a 50 higher value for the tanker with the delft series in between however for the performance prediction of wind assisted ships the resulting drift angle is of higher importance than the value of the generated side force in fig 15b a comparison of the drift angle during measurements and the drift angle that would generate the same lift according to the prediction are compared the drift angles of all delft hulls are very close with a maximum of 1 degree deviation the series 60 hull shows a deviation of approximately 2 at the largest drift angle during measurements 10 and the deviation for the tanker increases to 3 keeping in mind the limited input to the shipclean model and the measurement uncertainties these are acceptable prediction results especially since the drag coefficient is coupled to the lift coefficient and not the drift angle as described in the following section to improve this method more data is needed to find relations between the hull parameters especially the bilge radius and block coefficient on i the k value and ii the efficient aspect ratio i e the factor 1 δ b b 2 3 6 3 hydrodynamic drag forces of the hull the prediction of the induced drag of the hull based on model tests or simulations is difficult since any uncertainties in the measurement of the longitudinal force will highly affect the induced drag which at small drift angles is just a small part of the total drag force with respect to this the results from model tests must be handled carefully and it must be expected that theoretical predictions will not accurately reflect all model test results as described in section 3 5 2 the lift force consists of two parts a linear part cl1 and a nonlinear part caused by the cross flow drag cl2 subsequently the drag must also be divided into two parts 34 c d i c d i 1 c d i 2 the crossflow drag is a force acting normal to the ship s longitudinal axis where the part normal to the inflow is considered as a lift force the part parallel to the inflow is subsequently considered as drag 35 c d i 2 k sin 3 β using the k values shown in fig 13 the induced drag coefficient cdi1 is computed in fig 16 the ratio of the potential lift coefficient cl1 to the induced drag coefficient cdi1 over the drift angle is presented it must be noted that the presented lift to drag ratios are not the final values of the hull since the corresponding parts of the crossflow force are added for both the lift and the drag according to hoerner 1985 the induced drag increases linearly with the drift angle and the potential part of the lift coefficient and can be computed by with the drift angle β in radians 36 c d i c l 1 β a where a 0 5 according to hoerner 1985 estimations of the values of factor a for the sample ships are shown in fig 17 a the value of a is larger than 0 5 for all hulls and the drag coefficient is not linear to the drift angle in fig 17b the value of a for each hull is shown assuming that cdi is proportional to β0 6 which appears to be a better fit since the values of a are almost constant over the drift angle it can be observed that the hulls of the delft series show a large spread of the estimated values of a this implies that a is increasing with increasing block midship or prismatic coefficient since all other dimensions are equal for the hulls of the series however hull 1 of the delft series cb 0 72 cm 0 942 ar 0 0471 shows almost identical values of a as the series 60 hull cb 0 6 cm 0 977 ar 0 0535 additionally the tanker cb 0 81 cm 0 985 ar 0 0613 shows smaller values of a than the series 60 and the delft hull 1 which contradicts the trends observed from the hulls of the delft series as mentioned in section 3 5 2 the hulls of the delft series do not have any aftbody skegs which will cause additional effects since the lateral area will increase with increasing block coefficient as discussed in section 3 5 1 the drag and lift coefficient might be affected by the wave pattern a measure for the energy in the wave pattern and thus the wave heights is the wave resistance i e the residual resistance of a hull in fig 18 the mean values of a from fig 17b are related to the residual resistance coefficients cr of the hulls estimated by shipclean for the block coefficient the delft series hulls show an increasing trend of a with increasing cr while the group of the series 60 delft hull 1 and the tanker show the contrary in conclusion with the available data no clear dependency of the value of a on the block coefficient the aspect ratio or the residual resistance coefficient can be found thus the average value of a of all hulls is used which appears to be close to the value proposed in hoerner 1985 even though a linear dependency on the drift angle is assumed there in summary the induced drag can be computed by 37 c d i 0 66 c l β 0 6 0 6541 sin 3 β the lift to drag relation of all hulls is shown in fig 19 for the measured lift and drag continuous lines and the predicted lift and drag dashed lines since the lift and drag coefficients proposed in this study only depend on the aspect ratio all hulls of the delft series will have identical coefficients naturally the largest deviation between the measured and predicted lift to drag is found for the delft hulls 16 and 19 for the other hulls the deviation of the lift to drag ratio is within 15 which is deemed to be acceptable because of the limited input to the prediction and the limited measurement data available with more measurements or simulations a relation between the hull parameters especially the block coefficient and the factor a might be found additionally local hull form features especially the bow i e the leading edge will have considerable effects on the drag force 3 6 4 center of effort of the hydrodynamic lift force accurately predicting the center of effort of the lift force is crucial to predicting the necessary rudder angle the center of effort of the crossflow and the potential part of the lift force are at the geometric center of the lateral area kume et al 2006 and close to the center of the low pressure in the bow region abbot and von doenhoff 1959 respectively additionally the pressure distribution with low pressures at the forward downstream side and aft upstream side and high pressures at the forward up stream and aft downstream side creates a moment that tends to rotate the ship broadside to the flow this moment is also called the munk moment lewandowski 2004 since it is not possible to calculate the value of the munk moment without cfd computations it is included in the estimation of the center of the lifting force however empirical methods for maneuvering predictions as in inoue and hirano 1987 include the munk moment in the prediction of the yaw moment the munk moment is also the cause that some ships experience force centers well ahead of the ship as for example reported in van der kolk et al 2019b for a 2d wing the center of effort of the lift force including the munk moment is approximately 25 of the chord length from the tip and the center of effort moves towards the leading edge for 3d wings with decreasing aspect ratios abbot and von doenhoff 1959 since the aspect ratios of ships are very small the center of effort should be close to the bow the measurement results of the series 60 and the tanker prove this statement however the results from the delft series indicate that the center of effort is in front of the hull by up to a full ship length however the delft hull series is rather special since the hulls do not have any form of skeg in the aft thus the center of the lateral plane is far forward compared to the other hulls in fig 20 the measured center of effort of the series 60 and the tanker are compared with the predicted center of effort from the method proposed in inoue and hirano 1987 although the prediction does not fully match the measured values the trend of a more aft position of the center of effort with increasing drift angle is captured since both the side force and the yaw moment are small in model tests the calculated center of effort from model test results can deviate from reality in shipclean the center of effort is predicted using the equations proposed in inoue and hirano 1987 38 c o e n h y h l p p n v y v sin β n v v y v v s i n β 2 l p p 39 n v 2 t l p p 40 n v v 0 066 0 96 1 c b t b 41 y v π t l p p 1 4 c b

an efficient possibility to achieve high lift to drag ratios these centerboards must be high aspect ratio wings i e ar 4 the lift and drag coefficients of a high aspect ratio wing can be computed by

section presents examples of cases that refer to ship operations retrofitting and new designs of wind assisted ships the purpose is to demonstrate the usability of the shipclean model and how it can be used as a powerful simulation tool to analyze compare and recommend the design and operation of wind assisted ships section 4 2 discusses different modes of operation i e control of the rotor s rpm in section 4 3 the optimal placing and number of rotors are discussed followed by analyses of specific design recommendations for wind assisted propulsion section 4 4 discusses changes of the hull form propeller and general ship design if a ship is designed from scratch to have wind assisted propulsion uncertainties in the prediction of fuel savings from the flettner rotors are discussed in section 4 5 two ships a two propeller open shaft roro and a conventional single skeg tanker with main dimensions according to table 2 are used as case study ships the dimensions and costs of the flettner rotors are shown in table 3 based on data in norsepower 2019b initially both ships are equipped with four rotors as shown in fig 21 these initial configurations are used for the studies in section 4 2 the rotors are arranged to not interfere with the superstructure or the cargo area of the ships for the faster twin propeller and rudder roro the rotors are placed further aft since the ship has a forward superstructure and the double rudders can take more side force loads polar plots of the fuel consumption per nautical mile nm with sails related to the fuel consumption per nm without sails are shown in fig 22 for a tws of 10 m s and a ship speed of 12 kn for the tanker and a ship speed of 18 kn for the roro with this wind speed and a twa less than 40 50 degrees off bow the sails create added fuel consumption however the sails can generate fuel savings of up to 65 for the tanker and 55 for the roro for both ships the maximum savings are at a twa of approximately 110 the power consumption of the rotors is included in the remaining propulsion power and thus affects the fuel consumption the maximum rotor power is about 100 kw for a single 5 30m flettner rotor for the ships with 4 flettner rotors this corresponds to a maximal power consumption of the rotors of about 5 of the calm water propulsion power of the roro at 18kn and about 15 of the calm water propulsion power of the tanker at 12 kn 4 1 weather conditions and method to evaluate the expected savings wind measurements from ships on two routes one on the pacific ocean and one on the baltic sea are available from reference vessels in the shipclean project these measurements are used to simulate and assess the performance of the wind assisted ships for several scenarios the tanker is evaluated with the measurements from the pacific ocean and the roro with the weather from the baltic sea measurements were taken every hour over a full year a total of 6600 measurements with ship speeds higher than 5kn were taken for the pacific ocean route up time of 76 and 4700 measurements with ship speeds higher than 5kn were taken for the baltic sea route up time of 54 wind rose plots of the measured twa and tws on the pacific ocean a and the baltic sea b are presented in fig 23 although shipclean can simulate asymmetric rotor arrangements the current study is limited to symmetric arrangements of the rotors thus the wind angles are shown only for 0 180 twa with a peak at approximately 90 140 the wind angles on the pacific ocean route are much more favorable than on the baltic sea route which shows a peak at approximately 10 80 for both routes the wind speeds are distributed equally independent of the wind angle to save computational time a weighting system for different wind angles and speeds is developed the goal is to evaluate a set of 4 polar diagrams in steps of 20 for each ship a total of 40 points per ship at operational speed the simulations were performed for one target speed and account for involuntary speed loss i e reduced speed if the required power and rpm are outside of the engine envelope tillig et al 2017 the fuel savings at each angle will be multiplied with a weighting for the twa and the sum of all savings at one tws will then be multiplied by a factor for the wind speed with this procedure described in more detail later in this section it is possible to predict the expected fuel savings on the routes without evaluating each single measurement point however all points will be simulated for the ships without sails to obtain a benchmark fuel consumption to predict the payback times of the rotors to evaluate the weights probability density distributions pdf are fit to the measurement data histograms of the measurement data and the pdfs are presented in fig 24 for the twa and fig 25 for the tws weibull distributions are used for the tws data and kernel distributions are used for the twa data the weights are evaluated by 47 w x 1 x 2 p d f d x 0 x m a x p d f d x the resulting weights for the selected twa and tws ranges are shown in table 4 and table 5 together with the twa and tws that are used for estimating the fuel savings for the twa and tws range twsc twac the expected fuel savings are computed as the weighted sum of the estimated savings in all tws and twa combinations for the ships without and with sails the difference between the fuel consumption evaluated with all points of the route and the fuel consumption evaluated with the above method is 2 2 and 2 7 for the tanker and 3 1 and 3 3 for the roro respectively considering that the power difference caused by an increase of the wave height from 3 to 4m is about 19 for the roro and 34 for the tanker these differences are smaller than what could be expected between different years due to different weather conditions the above described method thus proved to be suitable for predicting fuel savings with acceptable accuracy for the purpose of the simulations and analyses an even more accurate prediction of the long term fuel savings could be achieved by increasing the time span of the measurements from 1 year to multiple years however for this study the time span of the measurements was limited to one year the wave heights are computed according to equations 48 and 49 coastal engineering resea 1984 with a maximum fetch of 50 nm for the baltic sea and 300 nm for the pacific ocean the wave encounter angle is assumed to be equal to the twa this assumption introduces uncertainties see section 4 5 since neither geographical effects e g land protection and shallow water or swell waves caused by weather systems further away are respected in the wave height estimation 48 h s 0 01616 u a f e t c h 49 u a 0 71 t w s 1 23 tws in m s 4 2 operation two main problems exist in the operation of wind assisted propelled ships using flettner rotors i choosing the optimal rpm of the rotors and ii choosing the optimal course wind angle to minimize the fuel consumption with constant velocity made good vmg while the second optimal wind angles is similar for other sail types the first problem is ultimately about choosing the optimal angle of attack of the sails the importance of an efficient rpm control is discussed in bordogna et al 2020 in bordogna et al 2020 it is shown that possible negative interaction effects between rotors can be highly reduced with a rpm control 4 2 1 rpm control of flettner rotors on a ship if the interaction between the sails and the hull is neglected i e drift and associated induced resistance and heel the optimal rpm of the flettner rotors is determined by maximizing the net power as shown in equation 10 however since interaction must be considered the rpm of single or several rotors sails must be reduced in certain conditions hereafter called reefed the sails must be reefed in case at least one of the following conditions is true 1 the heel angle is larger than the allowed maximum in shipclean ϕmax 8 2 the rudder angle is larger than the allowed maximum in shipclean δmax 10 3 the sails cause resistance instead of a forward thrust 4 the induced resistances from the rudder and hull drift are reduced more than the sail thrust if the sails are reefed i e the rpm of one or several rotors is reduced cases 1 3 can be identified from the 4 dof solution and case number 4 i e that the additional drag reduces quicker than the sail thrust can only be investigated by comparing a reefed and non reefed condition however case 4 is the most important for achieving the maximum efficiency of the sails especially in apparent wind angles forward from abeam for case number 3 i e the sails causing resistance instead of thrust all sails are put into idle mode i e the rpm at which the drag is minimal the minimum drag is found to be at a spin ratio of approximately 0 5 li et al 2012 kramer et al 2016 in all other cases only the most suitable rotors should be reefed to achieve the best possible balance between hull drift and rudder angle by moving the center of effort of the sail forces from analyzing the formulation for the lift and drag of the rudder equation 23 and 24 and the hull equation 33 and 37 it can be found that the lift to drag ratio of the rudder is much higher than the lift to drag ratio of the hull thus to minimize drag as much of the required lift force as possible must be delivered from the rudder for all conditions with side forces equal to or higher than the lift force of the rudder at the maximum angle the maximum rudder angle will be optimal three different conditions must thus be defined to specify which rotor to reef 1 the rudder angle is close to the optimal angle 2 the rudder angle is smaller than the optimal angle 3 the rudder angle is larger than the optimal angle for condition 1 all rotors are reefed simultaneously to keep the yaw moment as constant as possible for conditions two and three a score system is employed the score system assumes that the first rotors to reef are those with a low thrust to side force ratio thus those rotors obtain low scores additionally a score is added for the yaw moment for condition 2 rotors with a low yaw moment obtain low scores since the rudder angle i e the yaw moment will be larger for condition 3 rotors with high yaw moments obtain low scores in all cases reefing is performed iteratively with reefing factors evaluated from the required difference in side force or yaw moment the fuel savings with and without rpm control in 10 m s tws are presented in fig 26 for the tanker a and the roro b it is obvious that rpm control is crucial to maximize savings and avoid added consumption in twa between 30 and 80 degrees off bow using the method described in section 4 1 the estimated fuel saving for the roro with the initial sail set up and the rpm control is 14 3 without the rpm control this drops to 12 0 for the tanker the fuel savings are 26 0 with the rpm control and 24 8 without in fig 27 the rpm of each rotor is presented for the tanker a and roro b it must be kept in mind that a low rpm is not always the result of reefing but might be due to lower local wind speeds or different wind angles the results from the roro show that the full sail power i e all sails at full rpm is only used at a twa more than 110 degrees off bow it must be concluded that even if the sails produce thrust in wind angles more than 30 degrees off bow it is not beneficial to run all sails with full rpm in all conditions 4 2 2 optimal twa in fig 22 the fuel savings are highly dependent on the twa thus it can be assumed that it is beneficial to divert from the direct course to sail at more favorable twa while increasing the speed to keep the velocity made good vmg constant the speed at the new course can be computed by with twainit as the twa on the direct course 50 v s v s i n i t cos t w a t w a i n i t in fig 28 the fuel consumption per hour related to the fuel consumption on the direct course is shown for 3 diversion angles and 5 initial twas while there are no fuel savings if the twa on the direct course is 0 headwind the gains at an initial twa of 80 can reach 30 it must be noted that the results do account for increased ship speed due to the longer distance travelled but do not account for any necessary tacking or different wind angles further into the journey in order to reach the destination naturally the results for the complete journey highly depend on the weather ahead the achievable fuel savings and the dependency of the results on the weather along the route show the necessity of sophisticated weather routing for wind assisted ships 4 3 retrofit the focus in this section as part of a retrofit project is on the optimal size and number of sails and on the optimal position of the sails before varying the position of the sails 7 different arrangements are evaluated for the tanker and 4 different arrangements are evaluated for the roro see fig 29 the arrangements are designed and chosen to have similar geometric centers of the array of rotors the shipclean model with wind assisted propulsion was used to make simulations and analyses of the fuel savings for each of the cases the results are shown in fig 30 a for the 7 rotor arrangements on the tanker using the pacific ocean route and fig 30b for the 4 rotor arrangements on the roro using the baltic sea route additionally the payback times are estimated for 3 different fuel prices 300 eur ton 500 eur ton and 700 eur ton the results from this economic analysis are shown in fig 31 a for the tanker and fig 31b for the roro the results show that compared to the ships without wind assisted propulsion fuel savings greater than 30 can be achieved for the tanker savings for the roro are found to reach 14 since the fuel savings do not increase linearly with the number of rotors due to headwind and reefing but the investment and maintenance costs do the payback time is found to be the shortest for the arrangements with the fewest sails comparing the results from arrangements t4 1 t4 2 t6 1 t6 2 r2 1 and r2 2 it becomes obvious that due to interaction effects between the rotor sails it is important to choose the optimal arrangement for a given number of rotors however it must be kept in mind that the positions of the rotors in this study are not fully optimized for those arrangements the two most promising arrangements the one with the shortest payback time and the one with the highest savings per ship are chosen for further variation of the rotor s position the variables for variation are the longitudinal positions of the rotors during the variation a minimal distance between the rotors of 10 of the ship s length is ensured the best variants from this study are presented in table 6 with the fuel savings from the initial positions shown within brackets the results show that the savings are larger if the rotors are arranged further aft i e if the side force on the rudder is higher how far aft the rotors can be arranged depends on the size of the rudder and the speed of the ship i e the maximal side force the rudder s can produce due to the double rudders and higher speeds of the roro the best arrangement for this ship is when the aft rotors are almost above the rudder 4 4 new design from the result with the two example ships and the theory in section 3 it can be concluded that if the superstructure is short and the deck is free the focus during a new design project for wind assisted ships should be on the hydrodynamics with high side and thrust forces from the sails there are two areas of interest for improvement of hydrodynamics of wind assisted ships i the propeller design due to varying thrust load and ii the hydrodynamic lift generation since the side force from the sails must be compensated the first area the propeller design addresses avoiding pressure side cavitation which occurs at low propeller loads i e when the sails produce a considerable amount of forward thrust since the sails contribute up to 100 of the necessary thrust there will be conditions when the propeller is windmilling for the tanker with the t6 1 sail arrangement the propeller loadings are between 0 and 125 of the propeller loadings without sails due to those variable propeller loadings it must be concluded that ships designed for wind assisted propulsion i e with considerable large sail areas must be equipped with a controllable pitch propeller to avoid pressure side cavitation to increase the hydrodynamic lift generated by the hull the hull form should be designed accordingly in equation 33 it is shown that the generated lift is linearly dependent on the aspect ratio of the hull thus wind assisted ships should be designed with the highest ar possible i e high draft and short length however decreasing the length will increase the resistance as shown in section 3 5 there are differences in the lift and drag coefficients of the hulls studied that could not be captured by the wing theory which indicates that the hulls of wind assisted ships must be evaluated at a drift angle already in the design stage however even the hulls with the best lift to drag ratio are considerably worse than wings with high aspect ratios thus the most efficient way to increase the lift to drag ratio is to increase the area of any high aspect ratio wings on the hull i e the appendages for typical hulls this is only the rudder s one consideration could thus be to design the ships with twin rudders even if the ship is a single propeller design furthermore center or daggerboards could be applied to the hull as discussed in section 3 5 5 to show the effect of centerboards and double rudders the tanker and roro examples are modified the tanker is fitted with double rudders i e the rudder area is doubled and a centerboard the double rudders are not placed in the propeller slipstream which reduces the rudder forces this effect is captured in shipclean for the roro two daggerboards are fitted that are designed to keep the draft below 10 m i e suitable for the baltic sea while the centerboard of the tanker is designed to be theoretically fully hoistable into the hull the position of the centerboard is chosen slightly forward of the geometrical center of the sails the dimensions of the applied dagger centerboards are shown in table 7 the tanker is tested with the t6 1 rotor arrangement and the roro is tested with the r4 arrangement for the tanker the centerboard and double rudders increase the savings from 32 1 to 36 1 and for the roro the savings increase from 14 3 to 16 8 the results show that centerboards can increase the efficiency of a wind assisted propelled ship however to achieve maximum savings the side force distribution between the hull the rudder and the centerboard must be optimal this requires the centerboard position to be optimized together with the sail arrangement and position 4 5 uncertainties in the prediction of fuel savings from wind assisted propulsion this section presents a discussion of the uncertainties in the prediction of fuel savings from wind assisted propulsion it must be noted that this is a qualitative discussion of the uncertainties but not a complete quantitative uncertainty study especially for the full scale sail forces drift forces and aerodynamic interaction effects more measurement data must be available to quantitatively evaluate the uncertainties uncertainties in the prediction of the fuel consumption and fuel savings with wind assisted propulsion can be divided into four parts i uncertainties in the prediction of the hull resistance propulsive efficiency and specific fuel oil consumption of the engine ii uncertainties in the prediction of the sail forces iii uncertainties in the prediction of the hydrodynamic lift and drag of the hull and iv uncertainties in the prediction of the encountered weather the uncertainties in the power prediction using shipclean are quantified in tillig et al 2018 however since only fuel savings are of interest in this study these uncertainties will not affect the results since the resistance and propulsive efficiency are similar for the ship with and without wind assisted propulsion since the payback time depends on the total fuel costs it will be influenced by the uncertainties quantified in tillig et al 2018 the sail forces of a single rotor were verified against full scale measurements with good agreement for the lift drag and power coefficients see section 3 5 the comparison of the lift coefficient in a typical operational range of spin ratios between sr 1 5 and sr 2 5 shows that the difference between the full scale measurements and the shipclean prediction are less than 0 2 and the difference to the values according to li et al 2012 is less than 4 a similar comparison for the drag coefficient shows a difference of less than 1 for the shipclean predictions which is in agreement with the values in li et al 2012 the predicted power coefficient is within 1 of the mean value of the measurements for the given sr range the above differences show that the expected uncertainty in the prediction of the sail forces and power consumption for a single rotor is most likely well below 4 the prediction of the aerodynamic influences was compared to model test results see section 3 5 and it was shown that the predictions and the measured trends of the thrust forces were similar larger differences were found for the side forces however a quantification of uncertainties based on this comparison is not possible since the rotors were of different geometry and showed different lift and drag coefficients in single rotor tests however the influence of the aerodynamic interaction on the total thrust is small if the rotors are operated at their optimal sr for the local wind speed and direction as discussed in section 3 3 larger differences were found for the longitudinal center of the sail forces it is thus concluded that the uncertainty of the prediction of the fuel savings related to the aerodynamic interactions is small however uncertainty in the optimal positions of the rotors might be considerable the largest model uncertainties are expected from the lift and drag force prediction of the hull sailing at a drift angle in section 3 5 2 it is discussed that the predicted drift angle shows a difference of 1 3 at approximately 10 degrees of drift compared to the model tests of the sample ships however a difference of 1 3 in drift angle only results in a maximum difference of sail thrust due to the change of twa of approximately 1 thus more emphasis is put on an accurate prediction of the lift to drag ratio of a ship in section 3 5 3 it is evaluated that the predicted drag force differs by approximately 15 from the measured drag force during model tests of the sample ships for the tanker and the roro with the sail arrangements t4 1 and r4 the average of the predicted drag force is approximately 8 of the calm water resistance thus for these sail arrangements the uncertainty of the fuel saving prediction due to the uncertainty of the drag force can be estimated to approximately 2 these results show that the accuracy of the drift angle prediction i e the prediction of the lift force is not as important as the accurate prediction of the lift to drag relation of the hull large uncertainties are related to the prediction or variation of the weather conditions the ship will experience during its voyage to quantify the standard deviation and mean value of the fuel savings monte carlo simulations with statistical distributions of the wind direction and speed along the routes must be performed such a study is presented in tillig et al 2019 but it requires higher computational efforts since many points must be evaluated another possibility to reduce the uncertainty from the weather conditions is to use the method presented in section 4 1 but with measurement intervals longer than one year this will result in a more certain prediction of the long term fuel savings but will not provide the standard deviations as the method presented in tillig et al 2019 does it can be concluded that the largest uncertainties in the performance prediction using shipclean relate to the prediction of the lift and drag forces of a ship at a drift angle the source of the largest uncertainty for the prediction of the expected fuel savings is the weather conditions the ship will experience 5 conclusions the paper presented a continued development of a ship performance model called shipclean which is a ship energy system model that can be used to predict the performance of generic cargo ships the emphasis of the development presented in this study was on the detailed description of the modeling of wind assisted propulsion accounting for various interaction effects such as between the sails and the superstructure and other hydrodynamic effects the major conclusions of the study are that it is possible to predict with acceptable accuracy the performance of wind assisted cargo ships with very limited input information and in short computational time and large fuel savings can be achieved using flettner rotors on ships the theory of the new models implemented in shipclean that describe wind assisted propulsion were presented in detail together with other hydrodynamic effects that need to be included for sailing ships the flettner rotor sail was used as the main wind assisted technology of interest in several cases for two ship types a tanker and a roro the interaction between flettner rotors was modeled using potential flow theory the results showed that the total thrust was only slightly affected by the presence of other rotors however since some rotors gained and others suffered in performance the location of the center of effort was highly influenced by the interaction thus it was concluded that interaction effects between sails must be considered for wind assisted ships the sail module in shipclean was verified against model and full scale measurements as well as cfd results it was shown that for a single flettner rotor the lift and drag coefficients in the full scale measurements were considerably higher than those obtained by cfd computations or in model tests further it was shown that the method to predict the aerodynamic interaction effects shows good agreement with the trends of the thrust and side force coefficients measured in model tests for two flettner rotors the scope of the interaction effects related to the number of sails their positions ship type etc were difficult to generalize it is therefore recommended to engage in several specific scenario based analyses to understand how large interaction effects need to be to find a recommended or optimum condition setup for the ship type and route of interest thus many flettner rotor configurations and simulations were carried out which showed that the arrangement of the rotors on the ship influences the overall performance an effect that is only possible to capture if interaction effects are respected this finding highlighted the need for an additional model that enabled rpm control for the rotors due to interaction effects the results with this additional model showed large gains in performance if each rotor s rpm was optimized for the local wind speed the local wind angle the ships drift angle and the rudder angle additional savings of approximately 2 5 were achieved with the rpm control compared to if the rotors are operated at the optimum sr for the local wind speed and angle these findings show the complexity in the energy system of a ship and motivate using an energy systems based ship performance analysis model that accounts for interaction effects between sails a comparison of results from several model tests and empirical methods showed large discrepancies in the predicted lift and drag force of a hull sailing at a drift angle in this study low aspect ratio wing theory is applied to ship hulls a comparison was made between simulation results and model tests which led to the conclusion that wing theory is able to model the lift and drag more accurately than the empirical method but that the hull form of a ship has a large impact on the actual lift and drag of a ship it is concluded from an uncertainty study that an accurate prediction of the lift to drag relation of a ship hull sailing at a drift angle is more important than the accurate prediction of the drift angle simulations with realistic weather conditions and two example ships showed the versatility and applicability of the developed methods the results showed potential savings of up to 30 for a tanker with 6 flettner rotors on a pacific ocean route for a roro on the baltic sea the potential savings are shown to be approximately 14 with 4 flettner rotors from the study it was concluded that the arrangement and position of the rotors have a large impact on the ship s performance and fuel savings comparing results from the tanker and the roro it was concluded that the optimal arrangement differs largely depending on the ship design speed and weather conditions along the route credit authorship contribution statement fabian tillig

21716,effects of microbubbles injection on friction drag in a turbulent boundary layer are studied using large eddy simulation a flat plate turbulent boundary layer with a reynolds number re θ 1430 is generated within a short distance of inflow by introducing disturbances the parameters investigated include the gravity the injection height and the volume fraction of microbubbles it is found that the mechanism for drag reduction is threefold that is buoyancy acting on microbubbles the change of coherent structures and hydrodynamic viscosity near the wall under different conditions the dominant mechanism for drag reduction varies among them with microbubbles injected above the flat plate the primary mechanism is the lift of coherent structures from the wall and the decrease in the size and vorticity of the streamwise vortices when microbubble volume fraction increases the larger buoyancy acting on microbubbles leads to coherent structures shifted further away from the wall resulting in higher drag reduction with microbubbles injected beneath the flat plate the dominant mechanism is a significant decrease in hydrodynamic viscosity as buoyancy pushes microbubbles gathering near the wall and forming a thin air layer the drag reduction is higher than that of microbubbles injected above the flat plate keywords microbubble skin friction drag reduction turbulent boundary layer large eddy simulation 1 introduction when a marine vehicle travels through fluid with viscosity the resistance is against the object s movements in order to achieve higher cruising speed and at the same time to lower down energy consumption it has been an essential topic for decades of reducing the resistance of marine vehicles there are generally four kinds of drag that create resistance friction pressure wave making and air drag among which the hydrodynamic skin friction drag is a predominant component paik et al 2016 scholars have introduced a variety of techniques for drag reducing cai et al 2009 jiang et al 2019 gokcay et al 2004 kwon et al 2002 one of the most promising techniques is injecting air bubbles with a diameter of less than 1 mm into the near wall region this technique is referred to as microbubble drag reduction mbdr microbubble drag reduction has attracted considerable attention because of its significant advantages including secure operations low costs environmental friendly and high efficiency one of the first mbdr studies was reported by mccormick and bhattacharyya 1973 of employing electrolysis previous investigations have shown that microbubbles injection can reduce friction drag by as much as 80 madavan et al 1984 1985 a detailed review of understandings and applications of air injection for drag reduction on both underwater and surface vehicles was presented by ceccio 2010 the major microbubble parameters affecting the dynamics of microbubble drag reduction are summarized by merkle and deutsch 1992 including the downstream distance from injection location airflow rate incoming flow velocity plate direction geometric shape of the vent hole and wall roughness the air volume fraction in the near wall region is found to be a crucial one guin et al 1996 seeding small rigid spherical bubbles with volume fractions up to 8 into a turbulent channel flow the direct numerical simulation dns results in xu et al 2002 show that bubbles reduce the turbulent momentum transfer the increase of near wall air volume fraction and microbubble concentration tend to improve the amount of drag reduction moriguchi and kato 2002 the gravitational orientation is important for bubble concentration when microbubbles are injected beneath a flat plate the drag reduction is found to be more significant when buoyancy pushes bubbles toward the plate surface in madavan et al 1984 a similar conclusion is drawn by sanders et al 2006 who found that the injected bubbles coalesced and formed a gas film beneath the model surface under buoyancy and near 100 skin friction drag reduction was achieved in experimental studies the way of bubbles injected into the flow makes a significant difference in the microbubble distribution and microbubble layer thickness for example by winding at the head of rotating bodies and electrolysis to produce microbubbles microbubbles distributed in the viscous sublayer close to the wall if using ventilation to generate microbubbles different ventilation angles result in different microbubble layer thicknesses park et al 2015 applied repetitive bubble injection instead of the conventional continuous one kumagai et al 2015 developed a new power saving device that uses low pressure region to drive atmospheric air into the water for bubble generation elbing et al 2008 applied two different injectors to produce microbubbles and found the porous plate injector is more efficient than the slot one at high flow speeds in practical applications on the one hand the microbubble layer is expected to be as thin as possible to reduce energy consumption on the other hand the steady microbubble distribution in the turbulent boundary layer tbl is crucial for achieving impressive drag reduction such that the injection height cannot be too small even though the injection height of microbubble is tightly related to the drag reduction of microbubbles injection to the authors best knowledge the relevant studies have not been reported at present the mechanism for drag reduction of bubbles injection is reviewed by murai 2014 on several aspects including air cavity effect air layer effect size regime of the bubble and rheological effect effective interactions were found between a near wall vortex sheet and small air bubbles of the kolmogorov turbulence scale and a drag reduction of 44 9 was obtained villafuerte and hassan 2006 microbubble injection is found to reduce the reynold stress jacob et al 2010 paik et al 2016 and to increase the turbulent kinetic energy gabillet et al 2002 in the boundary layer and thus to reduce skin friction maryami et al 2015 investigated microbubble drag reduction in the couette taylor system and found that the vertical fluctuation motion and a high concentration of microbubbles in the buffer layer are favorable in reducing the skin friction drag eulerian eulerian two fluid model combined with different other models is mostly used for studying microbubble drag reduction kunz et al 2007 mohanarangam et al 2009 xiang et al 2011 the density effect of the air liquid mixture on the drag reduction is numerically studied in xu et al 2002 using dns and in skudarnov and lin 2006 by solving reynolds time averaged navier stokes equations respectively wu et al 2006 used the mixture model to simulate the microbubble flow around an axisymmetric body by employing an integral equation method amromin 2010 found that microbubble drag reduction takes place mainly due to a decreasing density near the wall and an increasing boundary layer thickness with a high air concentration large eddy simulation les is proved to predict the unsteady large scale coherent structures and transient turbulent characteristics accurately li et al 2015 yu et al 2014 wang et al 2014 wu et al 2015 in this article we investigate the effect of microbubbles on the friction drag in a turbulent flat plate boundary layer using les the objectives are to explain further the interactions between microbubbles and the turbulent boundary layer and to quantitatively determine the difference of drag reduction whether the microbubbles are injected above and beneath a flat plate the effect of microbubble injection height on the microbubble distribution is addressed the numerical simulations are performed with commercial software ansys fluent 15 0 the outline is as follows section 2 provides the les method the tbl generation and numerical validation in section 3 the effects of microbubble injection height air volume fraction and the flat plate direction on the friction drag are presented and the detailed flow field and physical mechanisms are analyzed finally in section 4 we summarize this work 2 numerical method 2 1 geometry models and boundary conditions the simulation for the entire flat plate tbl would cost too much computing resource due to the long distance for tbl development and the fine meshes inside the boundary layer therefore the parameters of microbubbles including volume fraction and thickness at the inlet of simulation area are specified and the microbubble velocity is set the same as the water of the same location as shown in fig 1 the physical model for various microbubble injection heights is shown in fig 1 a the air volume fraction φ v in is fixed as 0 1 five investigated injection heights that is h 10 50 200 560 and 850 are corresponding to the thicknesses of the viscous sublayer transition layer logarithmic law layer δ 14 8 mm the thickness of the tbl and 1 5δ respectively superscript denotes normalization by wall units e g u u u τ and y yu τ ν where u τ is the wall friction velocity and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the physical model for various φ v in is shown in fig 1 b three air volume fractions φ v in 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 are studied with a constant injection height h δ the flat plate is at the bottom of the computational domain for the above cases when studying the gravity effect the plate is set on the upper surface of the computational domain as shown in fig 1 c air volume fractions of 0 2 and 0 3 are studied with h δ and the results are compared with the cases of microbubbles injected above the flat plate setting microbubble parameters at inlet may have implicitly changed the initial conditions of the flow nevertheless the flow conditions are well documented at inlet also identical equations or motions to produce disturbances see subsection 2 3 are introduced at the inlet for the single and two phase flow simulations ferrante and elghobashi 2004 studied based on the dns data the effect of bubbles on drag reduction in a turbulent channel flow and specified the parameters of bubbles at time t 0 in their simulation domain and the turbulent flow conditions were made the same at the inlet plane for the single and two phase flows the boundary conditions are set as follows the streamwise velocity at the inlet which is a superposition of a mean inlet velocity u and a disturbance velocity is implemented by user defined function udf at the right side of the domain the mean velocity function in reichardt 1951 as shown in eq 1 is applied this velocity profile is commonly used in the inflow of a tbl generation bocquet et al 2014 guarini et al 2000 xu et al 2019 1 u 2 5 u τ ln 1 0 4 y u τ ν 7 8 u τ 1 e y u τ 11 ν y u τ 11 ν e 0 33 y u τ ν y 0 the implemented streamwise and wall normal disturbances are presented in detail in subsection 2 3 the air volume fraction and injection height are implemented by udf at the inlet the microbubble diameter is defined as 0 04 mm in the secondary phase dialog box of the mixture model in fluent the left side of the domain is set as a pressure outlet condition at the lower wall the upper wall in the study of gravity effect a no slip condition is used for velocity components at the upper surface the lower surface in the study of gravity effect a free slip boundary condition is applied periodic boundary conditions are used for the two spanwise surfaces 2 2 grid solution and les model the size of the computational domain is l x l y l z 10δ 3δ 3δ fig 1 the results are mainly analyzed at x 9δ where re θ 1430 based on the momentum thickness θ of the tbl and the inflow velocity u fig 2 shows the schematics of the turbulent boundary flow over a flat plate and the mesh generation the computational domain is discretized with a grid of 148 90 90 points uniformly distributed in the streamwise and spanwise directions fig 2b the grid resolutions for the inflow are approximately x 38 and z 18 in the wall normal direction the first point is located at y min 0 61 and there are 10 points exponentially distributing in the viscous sub layer up to y 10 moreover there are 50 points exponentially distributing within the range of y 10 and y δ and 40 points uniformly distributing within δ y 3δ respectively the grid solution presented above satisfies the requirements of les x 40 y min 1 z 20 it is suitable for a single phase flow and is also adequate for two phase flow simulation the mixture model is applied for solving the momentum continuity and energy equations for the mixture of the two phase flow this model treats flow as equilibrium mixture over short spatial length scales in the control volume the mixture properties including density and dynamic viscosity are calculated in each computational cell based on the proportion of each phase in the local cell the presence of microbubbles affects only the calculation of mixture properties and has no adverse effect on the grid resolution the cost required for dns to resolve the entire range of turbulent scales is proportional to re 3 the present re θ is 1430 it would cost tremendously to perform dns in this investigation for all the required cases as we aim to gain an in depth understanding of physical mechanisms behind the microbubble effect on friction drag reduction les is a natural choice where the large scale eddies are resolved directly with small scale eddies approximated using the subgrid scale sgs model the dynamic smagorinsky lilly sgs model kim 2004 is chosen in the calculation of the subgrid scale stresses resulting from the box filter pope 2000 where the filter scale is the cube root of cell volume the flow with microbubbles is of two phases the mixture model manninen et al 1996 is one of the euler euler multiphase models suitable for multiphase flows where the different phases may move at different velocities assuming a local equilibrium over short spatial length scales the mixture density and viscosity are calculated by 2 ρ m i x t u r e k 1 n α k ρ k 3 μ m i x t u r e k 1 n α k μ k where n 2 and α k is the volume fraction of phase k the slip velocity is defined as the velocity of microbubble relative to that of water and is solved with algebraic slip method referred to as manninen et al model manninen et al 1996 the momentum exchange between the liquid and air phases linked to the drag force is modeled by the schiller naumann drag model schiller and naumann 1935 the control equations need to be solved in discrete computational cells though with a better convergence the first order discretization scheme is in general less accurate than the second order scheme following spatial discretization schemes which compromise well the accuracy and numerical convergence are presently deployed including the third order muscl for momentum van leer 1979 presto for pressure term patankar 1980 quick for volume friction leonard and mokhtari 1990 second order upwind for the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate barth and jespersen 1989 the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations or simple patankar and spalding 1972 is used to resolve pressure velocity coupling the surface tension coefficient of the air bubble in water is set as 0 075 vargaftik et al 1983 the time step is 2 5 10 4s during simulation after the flow reaches a statistically steady state the data at t t u τ 2 ν 5700 about 22 flow through times are extracted for analysis with 16 000 samples because the size of microbubbles injected into the boundary layer is tiny compared with the boundary layer thickness the bubble liquid flow is treated as a homogeneous two phase mixture and the microbubbles are assumed of spherical shape as such only the effects of dynamic viscosity and gravity in this case refers to the buoyancy on microbubbles varying with φ v in are considered that is with φ v in increasing the dynamic viscosity of mixture decreases and the buoyancy acting on microbubbles increases therefore microbubbles tend to rise and migrate away from the flat plate when injected above it otherwise microbubbles will be accumulated near the flat plate effects of bubble surface oscillation and deformation which need to be treated by surface tracing method peng et al 2015 tryggvason et al 2001 fuster and colonius 2011 are not considered in this study park et al s 2019 experimental data showed a more pronounced drag reduction when bubbles coalesced into a cavity or an air layer the velocity fluctuation and strong shear stress in the tbl may cause the bubbles of large diameter to break up thus changing the microbubble distribution and hence drag reduction this effect is however not the focus of this work and left for the future investigation investigations of small bubble responding approximately as a rigid body can be found in magnaudet and eames 2000 xu et al 2002 and zhang et al 2020 2 3 turbulent boundary layer generation it is well understood that the inner layer of the turbulent boundary layer has low speed streaks which become unstable at high amplitude while the outer layer has large scale coherent structures in order to reproduce turbulent flow numerically here we follow sandham et al 2003 in which the streamwise and wall normal fluctuations were generated with one mode in the inner region and three modes in the outer region disturbances in the inner region denoted as u ˆ i n n e r and v ˆ i n n e r represent lifted streaks with a peak at a location of y p j while the outer region disturbances denoted as u ˆ o u t e r and v ˆ o u t e r are the superposition of 3 wave functions in order to represent three dimensional vortices the disturbances are provided as follows 4 u ˆ i n n e r c 1 0 y e y y p 0 sin ω 0 t cos β 0 z ϕ 0 5 v ˆ i n n e r c 2 0 y 2 e y y p 0 2 sin ω 0 t cos β 0 z ϕ 0 6 u ˆ o u t e r j 1 3 c 1 j y y p j e y y p j sin ω j t cos β j z ϕ j 7 v ˆ o u t e r j 1 3 c 2 j y y p j 2 e y y p j 2 sin ω j t cos β j z ϕ j where subscripts j 0 1 2 3 are mode indices y is the y coordinate in wall units and c i j is the perturbation constants forcing frequencies are denoted by ω j spanwise wave numbers by β j and phase shifts by ϕ j more information about turbulent inflow conditions prescribed by disturbances can be found in sandham et al 2003 the disturbances are directly implemented by udf to the computational domain inlet thus a turbulent flow can be obtained after a short distance of inflow without simulating the boundary layer transition process to determine the parameters of the perturbation equations we conducted a lot of initial simulations with modifying and optimizing the relevant parameters table 1 provides the parameters finally chosen which are proved to simulated the flat plate tbl precisely see subsection 2 4 2 4 validation with experimental data degraaff and eaton 2000 measured the mean flow and reynolds stresses for a flat plate tbl from re θ 1430 to 31 000 a single phase flow simulation is conducted first in order to validate the tbl generation method based on inflow disturbances the data obtained at x 9δ where re θ 1430 are compared with their experimental data at the same reynolds number fig 3 a shows the mean streamwise velocity profile in wall units which agrees reasonably well with the experimental results of degraaff and eaton 2000 in this paper represents spatial averaging in the spanwise direction in addition to time averaging of the enclosed quantity compared with the law of the wall the linear region is well simulated while there is small departure in the log law region this is probably because the turbulent boundary layer may not be fully developed as the calculation is made at only 9δ from the inflow fig 3 b shows the reynolds stresses compared with the experimental data the peak of the streamwise normal stress u 2 is well captured the difference in the peak value of v 2 and u v is probably mainly due to experimental uncertainties degraaff and eaton 2000 indicated an 8 uncertainty in the measured v 2 and 10 in u v ferrante and elghobashi 2004 also obtained a lower peak of u v by dns comparing with the same experimental data and attributed it to the 10 experimental uncertainty moreover les obtains a skin friction drag coefficient of 4 01 10 3 which is comparable with the experimental result 3 96 10 3 with an error of 1 3 the comparison provides a validation for the present simulation method for the tbl laden with microbubbles as shown in table 2 c f decreases monotonically with increasing φ v in for both cases where microbubbles are injected above indicated by above and beneath indicated by beneath the flat plate respectively moreover c f is smaller beneath the plate than above given the same φ v in these results are in qualitative agreement with ferrante and elghobashi s 2004 data obtained at the same re θ 1430 with a lower microbubble volume fraction and madavan et al s 1984 1985 measurement at a higher re θ this comparison provides yet another validation for the present calculation 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of microbubble injection height 3 1 1 drag reduction effect fig 4 shows the changes in the skin friction coefficient and drag reduction on the plate surface along streamwise the vertical black dashed line indicates the location of x 9δ x 5061 6 it is found that along the flow direction the skin friction coefficient decreases with the developing tbl and the drag reduction increases in general at x 9δ the drag reduction dr 1 c f c f0 is in positive correlation with h for the conditions of h 10 dr 2 3 50 7 4 560 14 5 and 850 19 5 while drag reduction for h 200 4 2 does not follow this trend for h 200 the drag reduction is higher than that for h 50 in the region of x 4000 and becomes lower than that after x 4000 for h 10 the overall drag reduction is especially small and not steady the skin friction coefficient even increases in the range of x 3500 4200 3 1 2 development of microbubble volume fraction along streamwise the microbubble volume fraction for different y cross sections is labeled as φ v y fig 5 provides the changes of microbubble volume fraction along streamwise at y 2 7 5 10 and 38 note that the y axis range in fig 5 a is smaller than the others in order to show the data clear at y 2 7 even though φ v in 0 1 the microbubble volume fractions for the five cases are all lower than 0 02 in the present x axis region and fall to less than 0 005 at x 9δ due to microbubbles migrating away from the wall under buoyancy at y 5 the microbubble volume fractions are still low and decrease with downstream locations as microbubbles rising in the tbl the microbubble volume fractions almost recover to the inlet value to 0 08 at y 10 and 0 09 at y 38 for the cases of h 200 560 and 850 which illustrates that the microbubbles concentrate mainly in the buffer layer and outer nevertheless φ v y maintains at a low level for h 10 and 50 due to the thin microbubble layer thickness and low concentration of microbubbles especially for the case of h 10 for which the drag reduction effect can be ignored fig 4 b the curves φ v y for h 560 and 850 are coincident and reach a high level for y 10 and 38 corresponding to an evident drag reduction park et al 2019 investigated experimentally frictional drag reduction when injecting bubbles into a tbl the bubbles flowing along the border of buffer layer was found to be most effective in to cutting off the turbulent momentum transfer a drag reduction of 30 was achieved from kline et al 1967 the motion in the viscous sublayer is very complex when h δ the microbubble content is low and the overall buoyancy is insufficient to overcome the disturbance in the tbl and to produce an ascending velocity of microbubbles the distribution of microbubbles becomes unstable under the affection of the motion inside the boundary layer which may cause microbubbles colliding with the plate at h 10 and 50 because of the deficient microbubble concentration the collision can be ignored at h 200 in which the microbubble is inside the boundary layer and meanwhile has a relatively large concentration the collision between microbubbles and flat plate can no longer be ignored the collision results in a lower drag reduction and a higher φ v y in the range of y 10 at h 200 than that at h 560 and 850 fig 5 a and b fig 6 shows the contours of instantaneous left and time averaged right microbubble volume fraction φ v y on the x y plane even though the ranges of the x and y axis in fig 6 a are much smaller than the others the presence of microbubbles is virtually invisible at of h 10 at h 50 and 200 the microbubble distribution in the boundary layer is very disorganized and chaotic and is greatly influenced by the inner layer disturbance of the tbl there is a considerable instantaneous variation of φ v y near the wall which is particularly obvious at h 200 due to this disordered microbubble movement the drag reduction does not regularly increase with increasing h besides the unstable air liquid interface causes substantial turbulence in vehicle course and is an ordeal for hull seakeeping at h 560 and 850 the instantaneous microbubble distribution in the boundary layer is very stable downstream and there are only slight fluctuations close to the edge of the boundary layer at h 560 the undisturbed outer boundary layer flow is of great help for maintaining a stable microbubble distribution therefore in practical engineering applications the microbubble injection height needs to be at least comparable to or larger than the boundary layer thickness to maintain a stable microbubble distribution 3 1 3 development along the wall normal direction fig 7 shows the distributions of φ v y and its gradient along the wall normal direction at x 9δ it is noted that φ v y at the near wall region becomes higher with increasing h which is conducive to the realization and maintenance of drag reduction the major changes in φ v y occur at y 1 20 for h 10 50 and 200 φ v y fig 7 a increases first and then decreases after reaching its peak at y 20 note that the log scale is used for abscissa the seemingly rapid falling in φ v y actually does not correspond to very large gradient for h 560 and 850 φ v y increases quickly first and gradually levels off as y increases beyond 100 it is noteworthy that φ v y is essentially unchanged from h 560 to 850 suggesting that the distribution of microbubbles inside the boundary layer will change little once the microbubble injection thickness goes beyond the tbl thickness and implying an increase in h beyond 560 has little influence on c f as such the effects of φ v in and plate orientation are investigated at this h value which is sufficient to find qualitatively how drag varies it should be mentioned that setting the microbubble thickness the same as the tbl for understanding the effect of bubbles on friction drag is a rather common practice for example ferrante and elghobashi 2004 conducted a dns study on the effect of bubbles on drag reduction their bubbles were also released within the boundary layer not outside at time t 0 in the computational domain outside the boundary layer φ v y would recover to and stay the same with φ v in and its gradient would be zero fig 8 shows the contours of instantaneous φ v y on the y z plane at x 9δ even though the ranges of x and y axis in fig 8 a are much smaller than that in the others there are no microbubbles observed at h 10 at h δ as shown in fig 8 b and c the microbubble distribution in the boundary layer is very chaotic up to y 300 at h 560 and 850 as shown in fig 8 d and e the disordered microbubble distribution exists only in the range of y 60 fig 9 presents the wall normal distributions of mean streamwise velocity its gradient the reynolds stresses u 2 and u v at x 9δ the streamwise velocity and its gradient are reduced with microbubbles injection compared with the no bubbles case moreover at higher h du dy is lower the result of case h 200 is an exception from fig 9 c u 2 is obviously reduced up to y 30 at h 560 and 850 and the peak of u 2 is also reduced and moves away from the wall it is indicated that the coherent structures in the boundary layer are shifted away from the wall and the sweep effect is weakened which is beneficial to reduce friction drag there is an appreciable drop in u v in the near wall region up to the buffer layer in the presence of the bubbles irrespective of the value of h the weakened momentum exchange is internally consistent with a decrease in c f once bubbles are injected for the cases of h δ the value of u 2 near the wall and the location of its peak show little change which means that the effect of microbubble injection on the coherent vortex structures is relatively small fig 10 shows the contours of instantaneous streamwise vorticity on y z plane at x 9δ without microbubbles injection there are obvious large scale vortical structures inside the tbl with microbubbles injection the large scale vortical structures break into small scale structures and the vorticity also decreases the vorticity decrease is more noticeable for large h fig 10 e and f than small ones fig 10 b and c for h 200 fig 10 d according to the previous analysis microbubbles are affected by the violent inner layer disturbance of the tbl and the large scale vortical structures remain unchanged in size or vorticity thus the major mechanism for drag reduction at various h is the favorable changes of the coherent structures and the tbl characteristics due to microbubbles injection zhang et al 2020 also found that the bubbles influenced adversely the vortex development and hence occurrence thus contributing to drag reduction 3 2 effect of air volume fraction and gravity different air volume fraction which is a critical parameter in the microbubble drag reduction technique will directly cause different microbubble distribution on downstream cross sections as studying the influence of air volume fraction φ v in 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 h 560 is given at the computational domain inlet the gravity effect of microbubble injection on the friction drag is also studied at φ v in 0 2 and 0 3 3 2 1 drag reduction effect table 2 in subsection 2 4 shows the comparison of the skin friction coefficient and drag reduction at x 9δ for different φ v in and whether the microbubbles are injected above and beneath the flat plate as φ v in increases from 0 1 to 0 3 the skin friction coefficient decreases along with the drag reduction increasing from 14 5 to 48 6 for above cases with gravity effect considered the drag reduction for beneath case increases up to 53 6 at φ v in 0 3 which is 10 3 higher 1 d r b e n e a t h d r a b o v e than that of the above case at φ v in 0 2 1 d r b e n e a t h d r a b o v e equals 20 6 that is the drag reduction of the beneath case is higher than that of the above case with φ v in increase the gap has narrowed fig 11 shows the trends of the skin friction coefficient and drag reduction on the plate surface along the streamwise direction the vertical black dashed line indicates the location of x 9δ x 5061 6 at any streamwise position for larger φ v in the skin friction coefficient decreases and the drag reduction is higher with gravity effect considered the skin friction coefficient of the beneath case is smaller than that of the above case and the drag reduction is higher before x 5200 however the influence of microbubbles on the tbl and the major mechanism for drag reduction of the beneath case differ from that of the above case which will be analyzed in detail below 3 2 2 development of microbubble volume fraction along streamwise for the convenience of discussing the microbubble distribution in the tbl the relative air volume fraction is introduced as φ v r φ v y φ v in for φ v y normalization fig 12 shows the change of φ v r along streamwise at y 2 7 5 10 and 38 respectively to present data clearly the vertical axis range in fig 12 a is smaller than the others for the above cases the increase of φ v in leads to a faster decrease of φ v r for the front part along streamwise and then has a corresponding smaller φ v r in the end at y 2 7 5 and 10 it indicates that at large φ v in the proportion of microbubbles migrating away from the wall is also large because of buoyancy and the ability of microbubbles to adhere to the plate surface reduces for the beneath cases φ v r increases along streamwise and is not less than one for y 2 7 5 and 10 in this case microbubbles have a momentum pointing to the wall because of buoyancy this momentum leads microbubbles to migrate toward the wall and to concentrate in the near wall region zhang et al 2020 noted a gradual migration of bubbles toward the upper wall under the buoyancy effect in a channel flow resulting in a decreased friction drag downstream the result demonstrated a pronounced effect of the near wall microbubble volume fraction on drag reduction at y 38 φ v r tends to stabilization along streamwise and equals to φ v in for all the cases fig 13 shows the contours of instantaneous streamwise velocity on the x z plane at y 2 7 for the case without microbubbles and the above cases the change of streamwise velocity streak structure which is an important factor for evaluating the drag reduction effect can be recognized due to microbubble injection with microbubbles injection the distance between low speed streaks blue streak structures is reduced at larger φ v in the relatively high speed streaks green region area are smaller along with larger low speed streaks which indicates that the streamwise velocity on the x z plane at y 2 7 decreases and tends to be uniform over the whole plane in fact the speed streaks correspond to the shear stress streaks that is a high speed region corresponds to a high shear stress region and a low speed streak corresponds to a low shear stress region since the skin friction drag is the integral of wall shear stress the friction drag reduction is directly related to the increase of the low speed streak area 3 2 3 development along the wall normal direction fig 14 presents the wall normal distributions of u du dy u 2 and u v at x 9δ for the above cases the effect of microbubble injection on the tbl is appreciable in the range of y 10 where u and du dy both decrease significantly with increasing φ v in the reynolds stresses are in general appreciably smaller than the case of no bubbles a larger φ v in leads to a more pronounced drop in u 2 for y 20 fig 14 c and in u v for y 100 fig 14 d and the maximum u 2 shifts further away from the wall furthermore the maximum u 2 and u v both drop appreciably in the presence of bubbles compared to the case of no bubbles indicating that microbubbles prevent effectively the momentum exchange between the inner and outer layers of the tbl the core of the coherent structures moves further away from the wall compared with the no bubbles case resulting in larger friction drag reduction thus the viscous layer grows gradually in thickness with an upward shift of the buffer layer which is consistent with the results in paik et al 2016 for the beneath cases the near wall du dy is larger than that of the above cases in the meantime the near wall u 2 and u v exceeds their counterparts in the absence of bubbles as well as those above the plate the observation seemingly contradicts to our previous analysis as is evident in table 2 drag reduction is more pronounced when injecting microbubbles beneath the plate than above equation 8 shows the newton inner friction law when y 0 it can be used to calculate the wall friction drag 8 τ w μ w u y y 0 where τ w is the wall friction drag and μ w is the average dynamic viscosity of the fluid near the wall from eq 8 for single phase flow only the streamwise velocity gradient on the wall needs to be examined because the dynamic viscosity is a constant for two phase flow or multi phase flow the wall normal distributions of mixture density and dynamic viscosity will be analyzed along with the reynolds stresses in an effort to understand the physical mechanism behind fig 15 shows the wall normal distributions of non dimensional density and dynamic viscosity of the mixture flow normalized by the density and dynamic viscosity of water respectively at x 9δ for the above cases the density and dynamic viscosity of the mixture flow near the wall are comparable to that of the single phase flow only water while for the beneath cases they decrease dramatically according to eq 8 these will result in a substantial drop in the skin friction drag the influence of microbubbles on the coherent structures in the tbl and viscosity of near wall fluid should be considered synthetically for the beneath cases the significant decrease of the near wall fluid dynamic viscosity is the major mechanism for drag reduction fig 16 shows the wall normal distribution of φ v r and its gradient at x 9δ for the above cases with larger φ v in φ v r at x 9δ is smaller and its gradient reaches 0 at a location farther away from the wall which indicates that the relative concentration of microbubbles near the wall decreases for the beneath cases φ v r near the wall are about 3 9 at φ v in 0 2 and 2 8 at φ v in 0 3 and are much higher than that of the above cases that is the near wall air volume fractions are about 0 8 at φ v in 0 2 and 0 9 at φ v in 0 3 for the beneath cases it means that microbubbles form a thin gas layer near the wall which replaces the water phase and separates it from the wall this is the most important reason for reducing drag with the gravity effect considered fig 17 shows the φ v y contours on the y z cross section at x 9δ for the beneath cases fig 17 a and c and the above cases fig 17 b and d for the beneath cases the φ v y value is close to 1 in the near wall region which means that the buoyancy pushes microbubbles toward the plate surface where microbubbles form an air layer and replace the water phase a similar phenomenon can be found in madavan et al 1984 and sanders et al 2006 for the above cases the φ v y near wall is very small and close to 0 thus the density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid stay the same with that of water or show little change and are not discussed as studying the above cases fig 18 shows the contours of instantaneous streamwise vorticity on the y z cross section at x 9δ for the above cases similar to the analysis in subsection 3 1 3 without microbubbles injection there are obvious large scale vertical structures in the tbl with microbubbles injection the large scale structures disappear and are replaced by small scale ones the vortices magnitude also decreases these changes are all beneficial for friction drag reduction the phenomenon of bubbles migrating into and disrupting vortical structures are also found in a channel flow xu et al 2002 and a turbulent boundary layer ferrante and elghobashi 2004 it can be summarized that the streamwise vortical structures are changed due to microbubbles injection and the streamwise velocity near wall also decreases besides the spanwise vortexes in the tbl show no obvious changes with microbubbles injection and the detailed results are not shown here 4 conclusions the effects of microbubbles injection on friction drag in a turbulent boundary layer with re θ 1430 is studied using les the influence of microbubble injection height is evaluated for the first time the results of whether the microbubbles are injected above and beneath the plate are compared when other parameters are the same it is found that the mechanism for drag reduction is threefold that is buoyancy acting on microbubbles the change of coherent structures and the hydrodynamic viscosity of the near wall fluid under different conditions the dominant mechanism for drag reduction varies among them with microbubbles injected above the plate the change of coherent structures near the wall is found to be the major mechanism for drag reduction contours of instantaneous streamwise vorticity illustrate a reduction of both size and vorticity of the streamwise vortices in y 200 the peak of u 2 moves away from the wall which indicates a lift of coherent structures and thus the sweep and ejection events are weakened compared with no bubbles case when h δ the microbubble concentration is low and the microbubble distribution is disorganized in the boundary layer thus microbubbles have little effect on changing coherent structures when h δ φ v y maintains a high level in most of the turbulent boundary layer when h δ say 1 5 δ in this study the distribution of φ v y inside the boundary layer is the same with that of h δ outside the boundary layer φ v y remains unchanged and equals to φ v in it is conjectured that the same φ v y distribution trend exists when h 2 or 3 δ the drag reduction will increase accordingly with φ v in increasing buoyancy acting on microbubbles is the most important reason for a high drag reduction results show that the peak of u 2 moves further away which indicates that the coherent structures and thus the sweep and ejection events are shifted further away from the wall moreover flow in the viscous sublayer becomes more and more laminar along with the decrease of streamwise velocity and its gradient as well as reynolds stress resulting in a drag reduction up to 48 6 at φ v in 0 3 with microbubbles injected beneath the plate the dominant mechanism for reducing skin friction is a significant decrease in hydrodynamic viscosity of the near wall fluid buoyancy pushes microbubbles gathering near the plate surface and forming a thin air layer which replaces the water phase as a result drag reductions of 42 8 and 53 6 are achieved for φ v in 0 2 and 0 3 respectively which are 10 3 and 20 6 higher than that of microbubbles injected above the plate moreover guin et al 1996 found the drag reduction of bubbles injected at the top surface in channel flow is 54 higher than that of bubbles injected at the bottom surface with a near wall air volume fraction of 0 1 therefore the gravity effect plays an essential role in reducing drag and it is inferred that the effect is more significant at a relative low

21716,effects of microbubbles injection on friction drag in a turbulent boundary layer are studied using large eddy simulation a flat plate turbulent boundary layer with a reynolds number re θ 1430 is generated within a short distance of inflow by introducing disturbances the parameters investigated include the gravity the injection height and the volume fraction of microbubbles it is found that the mechanism for drag reduction is threefold that is buoyancy acting on microbubbles the change of coherent structures and hydrodynamic viscosity near the wall under different conditions the dominant mechanism for drag reduction varies among them with microbubbles injected above the flat plate the primary mechanism is the lift of coherent structures from the wall and the decrease in the size and vorticity of the streamwise vortices when microbubble volume fraction increases the larger buoyancy acting on microbubbles leads to coherent structures shifted further away from the wall resulting in higher drag reduction with microbubbles injected beneath the flat plate the dominant mechanism is a significant decrease in hydrodynamic viscosity as buoyancy pushes microbubbles gathering near the wall and forming a thin air layer the drag reduction is higher than that of microbubbles injected above the flat plate keywords microbubble skin friction drag reduction turbulent boundary layer large eddy simulation 1 introduction when a marine vehicle travels through fluid with viscosity the resistance is against the object s movements in order to achieve higher cruising speed and at the same time to lower down energy consumption it has been an essential topic for decades of reducing the resistance of marine vehicles there are generally four kinds of drag that create resistance friction pressure wave making and air drag among which the hydrodynamic skin friction drag is a predominant component paik et al 2016 scholars have introduced a variety of techniques for drag reducing cai et al 2009 jiang et al 2019 gokcay et al 2004 kwon et al 2002 one of the most promising techniques is injecting air bubbles with a diameter of less than 1 mm into the near wall region this technique is referred to as microbubble drag reduction mbdr microbubble drag reduction has attracted considerable attention because of its significant advantages including secure operations low costs environmental friendly and high efficiency one of the first mbdr studies was reported by mccormick and bhattacharyya 1973 of employing electrolysis previous investigations have shown that microbubbles injection can reduce friction drag by as much as 80 madavan et al 1984 1985 a detailed review of understandings and applications of air injection for drag reduction on both underwater and surface vehicles was presented by ceccio 2010 the major microbubble parameters affecting the dynamics of microbubble drag reduction are summarized by merkle and deutsch 1992 including the downstream distance from injection location airflow rate incoming flow velocity plate direction geometric shape of the vent hole and wall roughness the air volume fraction in the near wall region is found to be a crucial one guin et al 1996 seeding small rigid spherical bubbles with volume fractions up to 8 into a turbulent channel flow the direct numerical simulation dns results in xu et al 2002 show that bubbles reduce the turbulent momentum transfer the increase of near wall air volume fraction and microbubble concentration tend to improve the amount of drag reduction moriguchi and kato 2002 the gravitational orientation is important for bubble concentration when microbubbles are injected beneath a flat plate the drag reduction is found to be more significant when buoyancy pushes bubbles toward the plate surface in madavan et al 1984 a similar conclusion is drawn by sanders et al 2006 who found that the injected bubbles coalesced and formed a gas film beneath the model surface under buoyancy and near 100 skin friction drag reduction was achieved in experimental studies the way of bubbles injected into the flow makes a significant difference in the microbubble distribution and microbubble layer thickness for example by winding at the head of rotating bodies and electrolysis to produce microbubbles microbubbles distributed in the viscous sublayer close to the wall if using ventilation to generate microbubbles different ventilation angles result in different microbubble layer thicknesses park et al 2015 applied repetitive bubble injection instead of the conventional continuous one kumagai et al 2015 developed a new power saving device that uses low pressure region to drive atmospheric air into the water for bubble generation elbing et al 2008 applied two different injectors to produce microbubbles and found the porous plate injector is more efficient than the slot one at high flow speeds in practical applications on the one hand the microbubble layer is expected to be as thin as possible to reduce energy consumption on the other hand the steady microbubble distribution in the turbulent boundary layer tbl is crucial for achieving impressive drag reduction such that the injection height cannot be too small even though the injection height of microbubble is tightly related to the drag reduction of microbubbles injection to the authors best knowledge the relevant studies have not been reported at present the mechanism for drag reduction of bubbles injection is reviewed by murai 2014 on several aspects including air cavity effect air layer effect size regime of the bubble and rheological effect effective interactions were found between a near wall vortex sheet and small air bubbles of the kolmogorov turbulence scale and a drag reduction of 44 9 was obtained villafuerte and hassan 2006 microbubble injection is found to reduce the reynold stress jacob et al 2010 paik et al 2016 and to increase the turbulent kinetic energy gabillet et al 2002 in the boundary layer and thus to reduce skin friction maryami et al 2015 investigated microbubble drag reduction in the couette taylor system and found that the vertical fluctuation motion and a high concentration of microbubbles in the buffer layer are favorable in reducing the skin friction drag eulerian eulerian two fluid model combined with different other models is mostly used for studying microbubble drag reduction kunz et al 2007 mohanarangam et al 2009 xiang et al 2011 the density effect of the air liquid mixture on the drag reduction is numerically studied in xu et al 2002 using dns and in skudarnov and lin 2006 by solving reynolds time averaged navier stokes equations respectively wu et al 2006 used the mixture model to simulate the microbubble flow around an axisymmetric body by employing an integral equation method amromin 2010 found that microbubble drag reduction takes place mainly due to a decreasing density near the wall and an increasing boundary layer thickness with a high air concentration large eddy simulation les is proved to predict the unsteady large scale coherent structures and transient turbulent characteristics accurately li et al 2015 yu et al 2014 wang et al 2014 wu et al 2015 in this article we investigate the effect of microbubbles on the friction drag in a turbulent flat plate boundary layer using les the objectives are to explain further the interactions between microbubbles and the turbulent boundary layer and to quantitatively determine the difference of drag reduction whether the microbubbles are injected above and beneath a flat plate the effect of microbubble injection height on the microbubble distribution is addressed the numerical simulations are performed with commercial software ansys fluent 15 0 the outline is as follows section 2 provides the les method the tbl generation and numerical validation in section 3 the effects of microbubble injection height air volume fraction and the flat plate direction on the friction drag are presented and the detailed flow field and physical mechanisms are analyzed finally in section 4 we summarize this work 2 numerical method 2 1 geometry models and boundary conditions the simulation for the entire flat plate tbl would cost too much computing resource due to the long distance for tbl development and the fine meshes inside the boundary layer therefore the parameters of microbubbles including volume fraction and thickness at the inlet of simulation area are specified and the microbubble velocity is set the same as the water of the same location as shown in fig 1 the physical model for various microbubble injection heights is shown in fig 1 a the air volume fraction φ v in is fixed as 0 1 five investigated injection heights that is h 10 50 200 560 and 850 are corresponding to the thicknesses of the viscous sublayer transition layer logarithmic law layer δ 14 8 mm the thickness of the tbl and 1 5δ respectively superscript denotes normalization by wall units e g u u u τ and y yu τ ν where u τ is the wall friction velocity and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the physical model for various φ v in is shown in fig 1 b three air volume fractions φ v in 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 are studied with a constant injection height h δ the flat plate is at the bottom of the computational domain for the above cases when studying the gravity effect the plate is set on the upper surface of the computational domain as shown in fig 1 c air volume fractions of 0 2 and 0 3 are studied with h δ and the results are compared with the cases of microbubbles injected above the flat plate setting microbubble parameters at inlet may have implicitly changed the initial conditions of the flow nevertheless the flow conditions are well documented at inlet also identical equations or motions to produce disturbances see subsection 2 3 are introduced at the inlet for the single and two phase flow simulations ferrante and elghobashi 2004 studied based on the dns data the effect of bubbles on drag reduction in a turbulent channel flow and specified the parameters of bubbles at time t 0 in their simulation domain and the turbulent flow conditions were made the same at the inlet plane for the single and two phase flows the boundary conditions are set as follows the streamwise velocity at the inlet which is a superposition of a mean inlet velocity u and a disturbance velocity is implemented by user defined function udf at the right side of the domain the mean velocity function in reichardt 1951 as shown in eq 1 is applied this velocity profile is commonly used in the inflow of a tbl generation bocquet et al 2014 guarini et al 2000 xu et al 2019 1 u 2 5 u τ ln 1 0 4 y u τ ν 7 8 u τ 1 e y u τ 11 ν y u τ 11 ν e 0 33 y u τ ν y 0 the implemented streamwise and wall normal disturbances are presented in detail in subsection 2 3 the air volume fraction and injection height are implemented by udf at the inlet the microbubble diameter is defined as 0 04 mm in the secondary phase dialog box of the mixture model in fluent the left side of the domain is set as a pressure outlet condition at the lower wall the upper wall in the study of gravity effect a no slip condition is used for velocity components at the upper surface the lower surface in the study of gravity effect a free slip boundary condition is applied periodic boundary conditions are used for the two spanwise surfaces 2 2 grid solution and les model the size of the computational domain is l x l y l z 10δ 3δ 3δ fig 1 the results are mainly analyzed at x 9δ where re θ 1430 based on the momentum thickness θ of the tbl and the inflow velocity u fig 2 shows the schematics of the turbulent boundary flow over a flat plate and the mesh generation the computational domain is discretized with a grid of 148 90 90 points uniformly distributed in the streamwise and spanwise directions fig 2b the grid resolutions for the inflow are approximately x 38 and z 18 in the wall normal direction the first point is located at y min 0 61 and there are 10 points exponentially distributing in the viscous sub layer up to y 10 moreover there are 50 points exponentially distributing within the range of y 10 and y δ and 40 points uniformly distributing within δ y 3δ respectively the grid solution presented above satisfies the requirements of les x 40 y min 1 z 20 it is suitable for a single phase flow and is also adequate for two phase flow simulation the mixture model is applied for solving the momentum continuity and energy equations for the mixture of the two phase flow this model treats flow as equilibrium mixture over short spatial length scales in the control volume the mixture properties including density and dynamic viscosity are calculated in each computational cell based on the proportion of each phase in the local cell the presence of microbubbles affects only the calculation of mixture properties and has no adverse effect on the grid resolution the cost required for dns to resolve the entire range of turbulent scales is proportional to re 3 the present re θ is 1430 it would cost tremendously to perform dns in this investigation for all the required cases as we aim to gain an in depth understanding of physical mechanisms behind the microbubble effect on friction drag reduction les is a natural choice where the large scale eddies are resolved directly with small scale eddies approximated using the subgrid scale sgs model the dynamic smagorinsky lilly sgs model kim 2004 is chosen in the calculation of the subgrid scale stresses resulting from the box filter pope 2000 where the filter scale is the cube root of cell volume the flow with microbubbles is of two phases the mixture model manninen et al 1996 is one of the euler euler multiphase models suitable for multiphase flows where the different phases may move at different velocities assuming a local equilibrium over short spatial length scales the mixture density and viscosity are calculated by 2 ρ m i x t u r e k 1 n α k ρ k 3 μ m i x t u r e k 1 n α k μ k where n 2 and α k is the volume fraction of phase k the slip velocity is defined as the velocity of microbubble relative to that of water and is solved with algebraic slip method referred to as manninen et al model manninen et al 1996 the momentum exchange between the liquid and air phases linked to the drag force is modeled by the schiller naumann drag model schiller and naumann 1935 the control equations need to be solved in discrete computational cells though with a better convergence the first order discretization scheme is in general less accurate than the second order scheme following spatial discretization schemes which compromise well the accuracy and numerical convergence are presently deployed including the third order muscl for momentum van leer 1979 presto for pressure term patankar 1980 quick for volume friction leonard and mokhtari 1990 second order upwind for the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate barth and jespersen 1989 the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations or simple patankar and spalding 1972 is used to resolve pressure velocity coupling the surface tension coefficient of the air bubble in water is set as 0 075 vargaftik et al 1983 the time step is 2 5 10 4s during simulation after the flow reaches a statistically steady state the data at t t u τ 2 ν 5700 about 22 flow through times are extracted for analysis with 16 000 samples because the size of microbubbles injected into the boundary layer is tiny compared with the boundary layer thickness the bubble liquid flow is treated as a homogeneous two phase mixture and the microbubbles are assumed of spherical shape as such only the effects of dynamic viscosity and gravity in this case refers to the buoyancy on microbubbles varying with φ v in are considered that is with φ v in increasing the dynamic viscosity of mixture decreases and the buoyancy acting on microbubbles increases therefore microbubbles tend to rise and migrate away from the flat plate when injected above it otherwise microbubbles will be accumulated near the flat plate effects of bubble surface oscillation and deformation which need to be treated by surface tracing method peng et al 2015 tryggvason et al 2001 fuster and colonius 2011 are not considered in this study park et al s 2019 experimental data showed a more pronounced drag reduction when bubbles coalesced into a cavity or an air layer the velocity fluctuation and strong shear stress in the tbl may cause the bubbles of large diameter to break up thus changing the microbubble distribution and hence drag reduction this effect is however not the focus of this work and left for the future investigation investigations of small bubble responding approximately as a rigid body can be found in magnaudet and eames 2000 xu et al 2002 and zhang et al 2020 2 3 turbulent boundary layer generation it is well understood that the inner layer of the turbulent boundary layer has low speed streaks which become unstable at high amplitude while the outer layer has large scale coherent structures in order to reproduce turbulent flow numerically here we follow sandham et al 2003 in which the streamwise and wall normal fluctuations were generated with one mode in the inner region and three modes in the outer region disturbances in the inner region denoted as u ˆ i n n e r and v ˆ i n n e r represent lifted streaks with a peak at a location of y p j while the outer region disturbances denoted as u ˆ o u t e r and v ˆ o u t e r are the superposition of 3 wave functions in order to represent three dimensional vortices the disturbances are provided as follows 4 u ˆ i n n e r c 1 0 y e y y p 0 sin ω 0 t cos β 0 z ϕ 0 5 v ˆ i n n e r c 2 0 y 2 e y y p 0 2 sin ω 0 t cos β 0 z ϕ 0 6 u ˆ o u t e r j 1 3 c 1 j y y p j e y y p j sin ω j t cos β j z ϕ j 7 v ˆ o u t e r j 1 3 c 2 j y y p j 2 e y y p j 2 sin ω j t cos β j z ϕ j where subscripts j 0 1 2 3 are mode indices y is the y coordinate in wall units and c i j is the perturbation constants forcing frequencies are denoted by ω j spanwise wave numbers by β j and phase shifts by ϕ j more information about turbulent inflow conditions prescribed by disturbances can be found in sandham et al 2003 the disturbances are directly implemented by udf to the computational domain inlet thus a turbulent flow can be obtained after a short distance of inflow without simulating the boundary layer transition process to determine the parameters of the perturbation equations we conducted a lot of initial simulations with modifying and optimizing the relevant parameters table 1 provides the parameters finally chosen which are proved to simulated the flat plate tbl precisely see subsection 2 4 2 4 validation with experimental data degraaff and eaton 2000 measured the mean flow and reynolds stresses for a flat plate tbl from re θ 1430 to 31 000 a single phase flow simulation is conducted first in order to validate the tbl generation method based on inflow disturbances the data obtained at x 9δ where re θ 1430 are compared with their experimental data at the same reynolds number fig 3 a shows the mean streamwise velocity profile in wall units which agrees reasonably well with the experimental results of degraaff and eaton 2000 in this paper represents spatial averaging in the spanwise direction in addition to time averaging of the enclosed quantity compared with the law of the wall the linear region is well simulated while there is small departure in the log law region this is probably because the turbulent boundary layer may not be fully developed as the calculation is made at only 9δ from the inflow fig 3 b shows the reynolds stresses compared with the experimental data the peak of the streamwise normal stress u 2 is well captured the difference in the peak value of v 2 and u v is probably mainly due to experimental uncertainties degraaff and eaton 2000 indicated an 8 uncertainty in the measured v 2 and 10 in u v ferrante and elghobashi 2004 also obtained a lower peak of u v by dns comparing with the same experimental data and attributed it to the 10 experimental uncertainty moreover les obtains a skin friction drag coefficient of 4 01 10 3 which is comparable with the experimental result 3 96 10 3 with an error of 1 3 the comparison provides a validation for the present simulation method for the tbl laden with microbubbles as shown in table 2 c f decreases monotonically with increasing φ v in for both cases where microbubbles are injected above indicated by above and beneath indicated by beneath the flat plate respectively moreover c f is smaller beneath the plate than above given the same φ v in these results are in qualitative agreement with ferrante and elghobashi s 2004 data obtained at the same re θ 1430 with a lower microbubble volume fraction and madavan et al s 1984 1985 measurement at a higher re θ this comparison provides yet another validation for the present calculation 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of microbubble injection height 3 1 1 drag reduction effect fig 4 shows the changes in the skin friction coefficient and drag reduction on the plate surface along streamwise the vertical black dashed line indicates the location of x 9δ x 5061 6 it is found that along the flow direction the skin friction coefficient decreases with the developing tbl and the drag reduction increases in general at x 9δ the drag reduction dr 1 c f c f0 is in positive correlation with h for the conditions of h 10 dr 2 3 50 7 4 560 14 5 and 850 19 5 while drag reduction for h 200 4 2 does not follow this trend for h 200 the drag reduction is higher than that for h 50 in the region of x 4000 and becomes lower than that after x 4000 for h 10 the overall drag reduction is especially small and not steady the skin friction coefficient even increases in the range of x 3500 4200 3 1 2 development of microbubble volume fraction along streamwise the microbubble volume fraction for different y cross sections is labeled as φ v y fig 5 provides the changes of microbubble volume fraction along streamwise at y 2 7 5 10 and 38 note that the y axis range in fig 5 a is smaller than the others in order to show the data clear at y 2 7 even though φ v in 0 1 the microbubble volume fractions for the five cases are all lower than 0 02 in the present x axis region and fall to less than 0 005 at x 9δ due to microbubbles migrating away from the wall under buoyancy at y 5 the microbubble volume fractions are still low and decrease with downstream locations as microbubbles rising in the tbl the microbubble volume fractions almost recover to the inlet value to 0 08 at y 10 and 0 09 at y 38 for the cases of h 200 560 and 850 which illustrates that the microbubbles concentrate mainly in the buffer layer and outer nevertheless φ v y maintains at a low level for h 10 and 50 due to the thin microbubble layer thickness and low concentration of microbubbles especially for the case of h 10 for which the drag reduction effect can be ignored fig 4 b the curves φ v y for h 560 and 850 are coincident and reach a high level for y 10 and 38 corresponding to an evident drag reduction park et al 2019 investigated experimentally frictional drag reduction when injecting bubbles into a tbl the bubbles flowing along the border of buffer layer was found to be most effective in to cutting off the turbulent momentum transfer a drag reduction of 30 was achieved from kline et al 1967 the motion in the viscous sublayer is very complex when h δ the microbubble content is low and the overall buoyancy is insufficient to overcome the disturbance in the tbl and to produce an ascending velocity of microbubbles the distribution of microbubbles becomes unstable under the affection of the motion inside the boundary layer which may cause microbubbles colliding with the plate at h 10 and 50 because of the deficient microbubble concentration the collision can be ignored at h 200 in which the microbubble is inside the boundary layer and meanwhile has a relatively large concentration the collision between microbubbles and flat plate can no longer be ignored the collision results in a lower drag reduction and a higher φ v y in the range of y 10 at h 200 than that at h 560 and 850 fig 5 a and b fig 6 shows the contours of instantaneous left and time averaged right microbubble volume fraction φ v y on the x y plane even though the ranges of the x and y axis in fig 6 a are much smaller than the others the presence of microbubbles is virtually invisible at of h 10 at h 50 and 200 the microbubble distribution in the boundary layer is very disorganized and chaotic and is greatly influenced by the inner layer disturbance of the tbl there is a considerable instantaneous variation of φ v y near the wall which is particularly obvious at h 200 due to this disordered microbubble movement the drag reduction does not regularly increase with increasing h besides the unstable air liquid interface causes substantial turbulence in vehicle course and is an ordeal for hull seakeeping at h 560 and 850 the instantaneous microbubble distribution in the boundary layer is very stable downstream and there are only slight fluctuations close to the edge of the boundary layer at h 560 the undisturbed outer boundary layer flow is of great help for maintaining a stable microbubble distribution therefore in practical engineering applications the microbubble injection height needs to be at least comparable to or larger than the boundary layer thickness to maintain a stable microbubble distribution 3 1 3 development along the wall normal direction fig 7 shows the distributions of φ v y and its gradient along the wall normal direction at x 9δ it is noted that φ v y at the near wall region becomes higher with increasing h which is conducive to the realization and maintenance of drag reduction the major changes in φ v y occur at y 1 20 for h 10 50 and 200 φ v y fig 7 a increases first and then decreases after reaching its peak at y 20 note that the log scale is used for abscissa the seemingly rapid falling in φ v y actually does not correspond to very large gradient for h 560 and 850 φ v y increases quickly first and gradually levels off as y increases beyond 100 it is noteworthy that φ v y is essentially unchanged from h 560 to 850 suggesting that the distribution of microbubbles inside the boundary layer will change little once the microbubble injection thickness goes beyond the tbl thickness and implying an increase in h beyond 560 has little influence on c f as such the effects of φ v in and plate orientation are investigated at this h value which is sufficient to find qualitatively how drag varies it should be mentioned that setting the microbubble thickness the same as the tbl for understanding the effect of bubbles on friction drag is a rather common practice for example ferrante and elghobashi 2004 conducted a dns study on the effect of bubbles on drag reduction their bubbles were also released within the boundary layer not outside at time t 0 in the computational domain outside the boundary layer φ v y would recover to and stay the same with φ v in and its gradient would be zero fig 8 shows the contours of instantaneous φ v y on the y z plane at x 9δ even though the ranges of x and y axis in fig 8 a are much smaller than that in the others there are no microbubbles observed at h 10 at h δ as shown in fig 8 b and c the microbubble distribution in the boundary layer is very chaotic up to y 300 at h 560 and 850 as shown in fig 8 d and e the disordered microbubble distribution exists only in the range of y 60 fig 9 presents the wall normal distributions of mean streamwise velocity its gradient the reynolds stresses u 2 and u v at x 9δ the streamwise velocity and its gradient are reduced with microbubbles injection compared with the no bubbles case moreover at higher h du dy is lower the result of case h 200 is an exception from fig 9 c u 2 is obviously reduced up to y 30 at h 560 and 850 and the peak of u 2 is also reduced and moves away from the wall it is indicated that the coherent structures in the boundary layer are shifted away from the wall and the sweep effect is weakened which is beneficial to reduce friction drag there is an appreciable drop in u v in the near wall region up to the buffer layer in the presence of the bubbles irrespective of the value of h the weakened momentum exchange is internally consistent with a decrease in c f once bubbles are injected for the cases of h δ the value of u 2 near the wall and the location of its peak show little change which means that the effect of microbubble injection on the coherent vortex structures is relatively small fig 10 shows the contours of instantaneous streamwise vorticity on y z plane at x 9δ without microbubbles injection there are obvious large scale vortical structures inside the tbl with microbubbles injection the large scale vortical structures break into small scale structures and the vorticity also decreases the vorticity decrease is more noticeable for large h fig 10 e and f than small ones fig 10 b and c for h 200 fig 10 d according to the previous analysis microbubbles are affected by the violent inner layer disturbance of the tbl and the large scale vortical structures remain unchanged in size or vorticity thus the major mechanism for drag reduction at various h is the favorable changes of the coherent structures and the tbl characteristics due to microbubbles injection zhang et al 2020 also found that the bubbles influenced adversely the vortex development and hence occurrence thus contributing to drag reduction 3 2 effect of air volume fraction and gravity different air volume fraction which is a critical parameter in the microbubble drag reduction technique will directly cause different microbubble distribution on downstream cross sections as studying the influence of air volume fraction φ v in 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 h 560 is given at the computational domain inlet the gravity effect of microbubble injection on the friction drag is also studied at φ v in 0 2 and 0 3 3 2 1 drag reduction effect table 2 in subsection 2 4 shows the comparison of the skin friction coefficient and drag reduction at x 9δ for different φ v in and whether the microbubbles are injected above and beneath the flat plate as φ v in increases from 0 1 to 0 3 the skin friction coefficient decreases along with the drag reduction increasing from 14 5 to 48 6 for above cases with gravity effect considered the drag reduction for beneath case increases up to 53 6 at φ v in 0 3 which is 10 3 higher 1 d r b e n e a t h d r a b o v e than that of the above case at φ v in 0 2 1 d r b e n e a t h d r a b o v e equals 20 6 that is the drag reduction of the beneath case is higher than that of the above case with φ v in increase the gap has narrowed fig 11 shows the trends of the skin friction coefficient and drag reduction on the plate surface along the streamwise direction the vertical black dashed line indicates the location of x 9δ x 5061 6 at any streamwise position for larger φ v in the skin friction coefficient decreases and the drag reduction is higher with gravity effect considered the skin friction coefficient of the beneath case is smaller than that of the above case and the drag reduction is higher before x 5200 however the influence of microbubbles on the tbl and the major mechanism for drag reduction of the beneath case differ from that of the above case which will be analyzed in detail below 3 2 2 development of microbubble volume fraction along streamwise for the convenience of discussing the microbubble distribution in the tbl the relative air volume fraction is introduced as φ v r φ v y φ v in for φ v y normalization fig 12 shows the change of φ v r along streamwise at y 2 7 5 10 and 38 respectively to present data clearly the vertical axis range in fig 12 a is smaller than the others for the above cases the increase of φ v in leads to a faster decrease of φ v r for the front part along streamwise and then has a corresponding smaller φ v r in the end at y 2 7 5 and 10 it indicates that at large φ v in the proportion of microbubbles migrating away from the wall is also large because of buoyancy and the ability of microbubbles to adhere to the plate surface reduces for the beneath cases φ v r increases along streamwise and is not less than one for y 2 7 5 and 10 in this case microbubbles have a momentum pointing to the wall because of buoyancy this momentum leads microbubbles to migrate toward the wall and to concentrate in the near wall region zhang et al 2020 noted a gradual migration of bubbles toward the upper wall under the buoyancy effect in a channel flow resulting in a decreased friction drag downstream the result demonstrated a pronounced effect of the near wall microbubble volume fraction on drag reduction at y 38 φ v r tends to stabilization along streamwise and equals to φ v in for all the cases fig 13 shows the contours of instantaneous streamwise velocity on the x z plane at y 2 7 for the case without microbubbles and the above cases the change of streamwise velocity streak structure which is an important factor for evaluating the drag reduction effect can be recognized due to microbubble injection with microbubbles injection the distance between low speed streaks blue streak structures is reduced at larger φ v in the relatively high speed streaks green region area are smaller along with larger low speed streaks which indicates that the streamwise velocity on the x z plane at y 2 7 decreases and tends to be uniform over the whole plane in fact the speed streaks correspond to the shear stress streaks that is a high speed region corresponds to a high shear stress region and a low speed streak corresponds to a low shear stress region since the skin friction drag is the integral of wall shear stress the friction drag reduction is directly related to the increase of the low speed streak area 3 2 3 development along the wall normal direction fig 14 presents the wall normal distributions of u du dy u 2 and u v at x 9δ for the above cases the effect of microbubble injection on the tbl is appreciable in the range of y 10 where u and du dy both decrease significantly with increasing φ v in the reynolds stresses are in general appreciably smaller than the case of no bubbles a larger φ v in leads to a more pronounced drop in u 2 for y 20 fig 14 c and in u v for y 100 fig 14 d and the maximum u 2 shifts further away from the wall furthermore the maximum u 2 and u v both drop appreciably in the presence of bubbles compared to the case of no bubbles indicating that microbubbles prevent effectively the momentum exchange between the inner and outer layers of the tbl the core of the coherent structures moves further away from the wall compared with the no bubbles case resulting in larger friction drag reduction thus the viscous layer grows gradually in thickness with an upward shift of the buffer layer which is consistent with the results in paik et al 2016 for the beneath cases the near wall du dy is larger than that of the above cases in the meantime the near wall u 2 and u v exceeds their counterparts in the absence of bubbles as well as those above the plate the observation seemingly contradicts to our previous analysis as is evident in table 2 drag reduction is more pronounced when injecting microbubbles beneath the plate than above equation 8 shows the newton inner friction law when y 0 it can be used to calculate the wall friction drag 8 τ w μ w u y y 0 where τ w is the wall friction drag and μ w is the average dynamic viscosity of the fluid near the wall from eq 8 for single phase flow only the streamwise velocity gradient on the wall needs to be examined because the dynamic viscosity is a constant for two phase flow or multi phase flow the wall normal distributions of mixture density and dynamic viscosity will be analyzed along with the reynolds stresses in an effort to understand the physical mechanism behind fig 15 shows the wall normal distributions of non dimensional density and dynamic viscosity of the mixture flow normalized by the density and dynamic viscosity of water respectively at x 9δ for the above cases the density and dynamic viscosity of the mixture flow near the wall are comparable to that of the single phase flow only water while for the beneath cases they decrease dramatically according to eq 8 these will result in a substantial drop in the skin friction drag the influence of microbubbles on the coherent structures in the tbl and viscosity of near wall fluid should be considered synthetically for the beneath cases the significant decrease of the near wall fluid dynamic viscosity is the major mechanism for drag reduction fig 16 shows the wall normal distribution of φ v r and its gradient at x 9δ for the above cases with larger φ v in φ v r at x 9δ is smaller and its gradient reaches 0 at a location farther away from the wall which indicates that the relative concentration of microbubbles near the wall decreases for the beneath cases φ v r near the wall are about 3 9 at φ v in 0 2 and 2 8 at φ v in 0 3 and are much higher than that of the above cases that is the near wall air volume fractions are about 0 8 at φ v in 0 2 and 0 9 at φ v in 0 3 for the beneath cases it means that microbubbles form a thin gas layer near the wall which replaces the water phase and separates it from the wall this is the most important reason for reducing drag with the gravity effect considered fig 17 shows the φ v y contours on the y z cross section at x 9δ for the beneath cases fig 17 a and c and the above cases fig 17 b and d for the beneath cases the φ v y value is close to 1 in the near wall region which means that the buoyancy pushes microbubbles toward the plate surface where microbubbles form an air layer and replace the water phase a similar phenomenon can be found in madavan et al 1984 and sanders et al 2006 for the above cases the φ v y near wall is very small and close to 0 thus the density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid stay the same with that of water or show little change and are not discussed as studying the above cases fig 18 shows the contours of instantaneous streamwise vorticity on the y z cross section at x 9δ for the above cases similar to the analysis in subsection 3 1 3 without microbubbles injection there are obvious large scale vertical structures in the tbl with microbubbles injection the large scale structures disappear and are replaced by small scale ones the vortices magnitude also decreases these changes are all beneficial for friction drag reduction the phenomenon of bubbles migrating into and disrupting vortical structures are also found in a channel flow xu et al 2002 and a turbulent boundary layer ferrante and elghobashi 2004 it can be summarized that the streamwise vortical structures are changed due to microbubbles injection and the streamwise velocity near wall also decreases besides the spanwise vortexes in the tbl show no obvious changes with microbubbles injection and the detailed results are not shown here 4 conclusions the effects of microbubbles injection on friction drag in a turbulent boundary layer with re θ 1430 is studied using les the influence of microbubble injection height is evaluated for the first time the results of whether the microbubbles are injected above and beneath the plate are compared when other parameters are the same it is found that the mechanism for drag reduction is threefold that is buoyancy acting on microbubbles the change of coherent structures and the hydrodynamic viscosity of the near wall fluid under different conditions the dominant mechanism for drag reduction varies among them with microbubbles injected above the plate the change of coherent structures near the wall is found to be the major mechanism for drag reduction contours of instantaneous streamwise vorticity illustrate a reduction of both size and vorticity of the streamwise vortices in y 200 the peak of u 2 moves away from the wall which indicates a lift of coherent structures and thus the sweep and ejection events are weakened compared with no bubbles case when h δ the microbubble concentration is low and the microbubble distribution is disorganized in the boundary layer thus microbubbles have little effect on changing coherent structures when h δ φ v y maintains a high level in most of the turbulent boundary layer when h δ say 1 5 δ in this study the distribution of φ v y inside the boundary layer is the same with that of h δ outside the boundary layer φ v y remains unchanged and equals to φ v in it is conjectured that the same φ v y distribution trend exists when h 2 or 3 δ the drag reduction will increase accordingly with φ v in increasing buoyancy acting on microbubbles is the most important reason for a high drag reduction results show that the peak of u 2 moves further away which indicates that the coherent structures and thus the sweep and ejection events are shifted further away from the wall moreover flow in the viscous sublayer becomes more and more laminar along with the decrease of streamwise velocity and its gradient as well as reynolds stress resulting in a drag reduction up to 48 6 at φ v in 0 3 with microbubbles injected beneath the plate the dominant mechanism for reducing skin friction is a significant decrease in hydrodynamic viscosity of the near wall fluid buoyancy pushes microbubbles gathering near the plate surface and forming a thin air layer which replaces the water phase as a result drag reductions of 42 8 and 53 6 are achieved for φ v in 0 2 and 0 3 respectively which are 10 3 and 20 6 higher than that of microbubbles injected above the plate moreover guin et al 1996 found the drag reduction of bubbles injected at the top surface in channel flow is 54 higher than that of bubbles injected at the bottom surface with a near wall air volume fraction of 0 1 therefore the gravity effect plays an essential role in reducing drag and it is inferred that the effect is more significant at a relative low

21717,interactions of solitary waves with slotted breakwaters comprising a single row of vertical circular piles was studied using a numerical wave tank nwt based on the navier stokes equations the nwt combines the immersed boundary method to impose boundary conditions on solid surfaces the level set method to track the free surface and a fast poisson solver achieving efficient simulations the nwt was validated by comparisons to experimental and numerical data in the literature subsequently the assessment of the hydrodynamic behavior of the breakwater was carried out examining different values of incident wave height h i pile diameter d distance between piles s and spacing between piles e s d it was found that for constant d and decreasing e s the wave run up k r u reflection k r and energy loss k d coefficients increase while the transmission coefficient k t decreases also for constant e s and d increasing h i resulted into the increase of k r k r u and k d but the decrease of k t moreover for constant e s smaller d leads to increased k r u and k d and decreased k r and k t these trends amplify when h i increases to explain the effect of the geometric parameters wave breaking air entrapment and vorticity generation were examined in the vicinity of the piles keywords slotted breakwater solitary wave wave reflection and transmission wave breaking and energy loss vorticity generation efficient numerical wave tank 1 introduction the primary function of breakwaters is the protection of ports and coasts by dissipating and or reflecting the incident wave energy in their seaward region and by reducing wave transmission in their leeward region typical breakwaters either rubble mound or vertical front ones achieve this task by presenting a continuous barrier to the incident waves which in many occasions results into undesirable levels of wave refection in their seaward region and or undesirable environmental issues like the non renewal of water in their leeward region an alternative to rubble mound or vertical front breakwaters are a the perforated front breakwaters with an impermeable back wall and b the slotted breakwaters without a back wall a detailed literature review on these types of breakwater is found in huang et al 2011 and koraim 2014 in both cases the perforated slotted wall consists of rows of vertical or horizontal piles of circular or rectangular cross section here we focus on slotted breakwaters with a single row of vertical piles of circular cross section and a smooth surface as shown schematically in fig 1a the definitions of the main geometrical parameters of such structures are illustrated in fig 1b where d is the pile diameter s is the distance between the centers of adjacent piles e s d is the gap between adjacent piles and the porosity of the perforated wall is defined as ϵ e s compared to rubble mound and vertical front breakwaters the slotted breakwaters may present reduced wave reflection in their seaward region and simultaneously reduced wave transmission and sufficient water renewal and littoral drift in their leeward region in order to achieve optimum behavior both in their seaward and leeward regions the design of slotted breakwaters should be based on accurate predictions of the interaction between the relevant wave processes and flow behavior in the vicinity of the piles configurations comprising multiple rows and combinations of these vertical pile walls have been considered according to the application and the desired hydrodynamic behavior the interaction between waves and closely spaced vertical cylindrical piles is a challenging case to study in detail presenting similar characteristics difficulties with other wave structure interaction problems wave run up wave breaking and flow separation are highly nonlinear and complex phenomena that may simultaneously occur during the interaction of waves with vertical piles in general the understanding of the nonlinear interactions between waves and marine structures is one of the most challenging fields in ocean engineering using either experimental theoretical or numerical approaches for their analysis the analytical theoretical approaches involve numerous assumptions which can only be justified for simplified cases where strong nonlinearities are absent on the other hand experimental studies can provide significant insight into the relevant physical phenomena however quantities of interest such as velocity components or detailed free surface elevations are difficult to measure in detail in a non intrusive manner the numerical study of these problems using computational fluid dynamics cfd models is a challenging task mainly because of the significant computational resources required among different numerical models to study complex flows with wave breaking the fully nonlinear potential flow models can efficiently and accurately predict the occurrence of breaking iafrati et al 2014 however those models are not able to provide any information after the breaking point where the energy dissipation is enhanced iafrati 2011 for problems where both wave breaking and flow separation are present the most general and accurate numerical approach is the solution of the three dimensional 3d navier stokes ns equations this involves the transient solution of an incompressible turbulent flow of two immiscible fluids water and air the continuous evolution in computing power together with recent developments in efficient computational algorithms dodd and ferrante 2014 frantzis and grigoriadis 2019 make ns based simulations even more attractive nowadays allowing detailed and accurate parametric studies for these challenging flow problems the hydrodynamic behavior of slotted breakwaters with vertical piles under regular waves has been mostly studied experimentally and theoretically experimental measurements for circular and rectangular piles were performed by kakuno and liu 1993 who also developed a theoretical method of matched asymptotic expansions including an empirical model to account for the dissipation effect to calculate the transmission and reflection coefficients k t and k r experimental results showed that the energy loss coefficient k d was almost independent of the reynolds r e and keulegan carpenter numbers when their values are in the ranges 2 4 1 0 3 1 5 1 0 4 and 0 35 3 4 respectively in a similar manner the forces acting on pile breakwaters were examined in kriebel 1993 and kakuno et al 1996 according to their results the streamwise force on a pile is mostly independent of the relative depth when the breakwater porosity is small and nearly constant when the porosity exceeds 50 moreover it was concluded that wave transmission decreases for shallow water and increasing wave steepness other analytical studies suh et al 2011 zhu 2011 zhu et al 2015 investigated the hydrodynamic behavior of slotted breakwaters with single row piles of rectangular cross section showing that they operate as low pass filters it was also found that wave transmission for long waves i e for s λ 1 where λ is the wave length is enhanced when the thickness of the slotted wall is increased i e when the streamwise length of the rectangular cross section is larger than the spanwise width experimental measurements for a two row pile breakwater configuration were performed in huang 2007c showing that minimum reflection is achieved when the streamwise distance between the two rows is one fourth of the incident wave length experiments to study the effect of an opposing current to the wave scattering were carried out in huang 2007a and demonstrate a remarkably decreased transmission compared to the absence of a current other studies found in the literature examined the hydrodynamic behavior of pile breakwaters under irregular waves isaacson et al 1998 park et al 2000 and the effect of the draft level of the piles i e for cases where the piles do not reach the seabed the slotted vertical pile breakwater is also used as protection against tsunami waves because it effectively reduces the transmitted energy of long waves huang and yuan 2010 when small porosity values are employed this characteristic becomes more important when a tsunami early warning system is not triggered by a small amplitude wave which could still cause damages to facilities in the leeward region e g harbour tsunami waves behave in a completely different way compared to regular or irregular waves especially if we take into account their magnitude and transformation while interacting with structures therefore the design of a pile breakwater should not be merely based on the effect of regular and irregular waves but tsunami type waves as well previous works intended to study tsunami type waves used the solitary wave theory because it represents important properties of the leading part of a real tsunami wave lin 2004 an important difference between a solitary wave and a tsunami wave is the absence in the former of negative free surface elevation i e below the still water level therefore solitary waves do not fully represent actual tsunami conditions but they have been used as an approximated form of tsunami waves madsen et al 2008 in fact solitary waves have been widely used in numerical and experimental studies approximating tsunami waves because they can be easily generated by conventional wavemakers rossetto et al 2011 the interaction of pile breakwaters with solitary waves was firstly studied in huang and yuan 2010 providing experimental measurements for piles of circular cross section three values of porosity two values of water depth d and a range of incident wave height h i d 0 2 0 6 were examined the results were compared against predictions of the long wave approximation huang 2007c showing a good overall agreement for k t while k r was accurately predicted only for smaller wave heights i e h i d 0 2 the experimental measurements in huang and yuan 2010 were later used in liu et al 2011 to examine the suitability of depth averaged shallow water equations to predict the coefficients k t and k r it was concluded that this set of equations can provide accurate predictions only when h i d 0 25 where the nonlinear interactions are weaker the main reason for the inaccuracy of both long wave approximation and depth averaged shallow water equations in cases of large wave heights is their inability to account for wave breaking phenomena that also lead to air entrapment and enhancement of the nonlinearities using the 3d ns equations to capture phenomena such as air entrapment jiang et al 2015 numerically studied the interaction between solitary waves and a single row pile breakwater results for a single set of geometrical parameters and a single wave height of h i d 0 35 within the highly nonlinear regime were provided and compared with experimental measurements performed in the same study the evolutionary behavior of the wave run up was discussed the study also focused on the comparison against the single isolated pile results in terms of wave run up profile around the pile vortex generation in the wake and impact force the results of the ns model showed a significant improvement on the prediction of k t compared to previous simpler models however k r was still slightly overpredicted subsequently ns based numerical simulations were also performed in yao et al 2017 for a two row configuration in the same study experimental measurements were also performed to validate a part of the numerical predictions results showed very good agreement for both k t and k r as well as for other quantities such as velocity components and dynamic pressure evolution the variation of the wave run up distribution and the forces acting on the front and back row of piles were also examined as a function of the incident wave height h i and the porosity ϵ it was concluded that increasing the wave height leads to increased values of dimensionless wave run up and reduced dimensionless wave forces according to the existing literature and the evaluation of the numerical results in jiang et al 2015 and yao et al 2017 it is evident that the two fluid 3d ns based numerical wave tank nwt is the only model that can provide accurate predictions on the hydrodynamic behavior of pile breakwaters especially for cases where highly nonlinear phenomena occur dissipation processes can be modeled very accurately since the viscous and other effects from complex phenomena such as turbulent vortices droplets and air pockets formed by wave breaking can be captured in the present study the efficient ns based nwt presented in frantzis et al 2020 was selected to investigate the nonlinear interaction between solitary waves of large height and single row pile breakwaters of circular cross section the effect of the pile diameter was examined for different porosity and incident wave height values keeping the water depth constant previous experimental studies liu et al 2011 huang and yuan 2010 found that k r and k t are nearly independent of the pile diameter to depth ratio d d in these experiments though the value of d d varied in a very narrow range of 0 15 0 20 inevitably resulting into negligible differences moreover in these studies the value of d d was varied by adjusting the water depth while the diameter was kept constant resulting into flows with different reynolds numbers r e ρ d g d μ based on the water depth however in design problems the water depth is given and the optimum pile diameter is sought therefore in order to clearly examine the effect of d d all simulations in the present study were set in a systematic way by i investigating d d in a wider range 0 2175 0 6525 and ii maintaining the same value of the r e number even though the viscous effects are not considered to be the primary ones for the specific r e number a specific value of the porosity can be achieved either by using many piles of small diameter or fewer piles of larger diameter varying in this way the texture of the pile arrangement in the rest of the manuscript for simplicity the short term texture will be used therefore for a constant porosity case the arrangement with many smaller piles will be referred as the fine texture one and the case with less larger piles as the coarse texture one the sketch in fig 2 demonstrates the difference between the two cases to avoid confusion it is noted that the term texture is not related to the roughness of the surface of the piles which is considered to be smooth in the present study the primary objective of this work was to study the effect of texture of a single row pile breakwater on wave processes induced by the passage of solitary waves and reveal their correlation to the complex free surface motion and the associated nonlinear flow behavior in the vicinity of the piles the mathematical and numerical background of the nwt used in the present study is briefly introduced in section 2 followed by descriptions of the computational setup and the geometrical parameters section 3 includes the results of the grid independence study and the validation of the nwt against the experimental data provided in jiang et al 2015 the parameters examined through numerical simulations and the corresponding results including the texture effect on k t and k r as well as on the wave run up profile around the piles are presented in section 4 subsequently the evolution of the free surface the energy loss and the vorticity generation for all cases are presented and discussed in terms of their correlation to the wave parameters in the same section conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 mathematical numerical model 2 1 governing equations the 3d nwt developed in frantzis et al 2020 which is used in the present study is based on the filtered ns equations the mass continuity equation along with the conservation of momentum describe the incompressible and viscous turbulent motion of two immiscible fluids the non dimensional form of this set of equations in the absence of surface tension effects reads 1 u 0 2 u t u u 1 ρ r e μ r e μ t u u t p ρ a f r where u p ρ and μ are the non dimensional velocity vector pressure density and dynamic viscosity respectively the last term in eq 2 is the non dimensional acceleration vector a g g where g is the gravity vector the reynolds r e and froude f r numbers in eq 2 are defined as 3 r e u o l o ρ o μ o and f r u o 2 l o g where l o and u o denote the characteristic scales used to non dimensionalize length and velocity respectively for all cases presented here these scales were selected to be the still water depth d and g d for length and velocity scales respectively the characteristic scales ρ o and μ o for density and viscosity respectively are chosen to correspond to the heavier fluid i e water as a result the non dimensional numbers that appear in eq 2 become 4 r e d g d ρ w μ w and f r 1 the unresolved motions of the sub grid scales sgs are represented through turbulent eddy viscosity μ t in eq 2 the need to model the unresolved scales of motion is necessary because of the high values of r e numbers that naturally appear in real life wave tanks the value of μ t can be computed using either reynolds averaged ns rans or large eddy simulation les approaches in this study the standard smagorinsky model smagorinsky 1963 is employed within the les approach to define the value of μ t from 5 μ t ρ c s δ 2 s where δ δ x δ y δ z 1 3 is the filter length scale defined by the grid and s 2 s i j s i j 1 2 denotes the modulus of the strain rate deformation tensor the value of the smagorinsky constant c s ranges from 0 065 to 0 23 in the literature meyers and sagaut 2006 depending on the flow problem in the present study the value of c s was set to 0 2 to recover a proper near wall behavior the smagorinsky model is modified in the proximity of solid boundaries using wall damping as described in grigoriadis et al 2003 one serious challenge in nwts is the tracking of the interface that separates the two immiscible fluids the exact location of this interface is required to define the density and viscosity fields in the present study the evolution of the free surface is captured using the conservative level set ls method osher and sethian 1988 sussman et al 1998 this method is based on a scalar field ϕ which describes the minimum signed distance form the interface it is used to define the density and viscosity according to 6 ρ ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ 1 h ϕ 7 μ μ 1 μ 2 μ 1 h ϕ where the subscripts refer to each fluid i e water or air the smoothed heaviside function h ϕ osher and fedkiw 2006 introduces an artificial thickness of the interface to eliminate numerical instabilities because of the discontinuous nature of density and viscosity fields the half thickness of this interface is usually selected equal to 1 5 2 times the grid spacing in cases of rapidly deforming interfaces large density ratios or high r e numbers a half thickness of 8 times the grid spacing could be required according to iafrati and campana 2005 in the present study the half thickness was set to 6 times the minimum grid distance 2 2 discretization and numerical implementation the presented physical model consists of equations which are discretized and solved on a non uniform cartesian grid with a staggered variable arrangement the velocity components u v w are defined at the cell faces while the remaining scalar variables p ρ μ ϕ are defined at the geometric center of each cell within the employed nwt the temporal advancement of the velocity and pressure fields is performed combining the fractional step method chorin 1968 with the pressure splitting scheme presented in frantzis and grigoriadis 2019 the spatial discretization of the convective terms in eq 2 employs the 3 rd order quick scheme the imposition of boundary conditions on solid obstacles in the computational domain is performed using the immersed boundary ib method peskin 1972 following a direct forcing approach for velocities balaras 2004 and the modifications proposed in frantzis and grigoriadis 2019 for the simulation of high r e number flow cases in nwts the c f l courant friedrichs levy becomes the dominant stability criterion regarding time step restrictions for the nwt used in this study a c f l m a x 0 025 is sufficient to guarantee numerical stability frantzis et al 2020 for a detailed description of the ib forcing the interfacial tracking using the ls method and the computational efficiency of the solver the reader is referred to frantzis et al 2020 frantzis and grigoriadis 2019 2 3 wave generation and absorption the schematic diagram of the computational domain is shown in fig 3 the entry region marked as a dotted box in fig 3 corresponds to the wave generation zone in this region of the nwt waves are generated using the relaxation method introduced by mayer et al 1998 provided that the length of this region l g is sufficient the method can also concurrently absorb reflected waves traveling towards this region different waves with pre described characteristics can be generated using analytical solutions the reader is referred to frantzis et al 2020 for a detailed description of the numerical procedure followed for the wave generation for the simulations performed here a solitary wave of height h i is produced using the 3 rd order analytical solution of grimshaw 1970 with a dimensionless wave celerity 8 c s o l i t a r y 1 1 2 h i d 3 20 h i d 2 3 56 h i d 3 following the wave generation zone the nwt comprises the working section of length l w at the end of this working section it is a common practice to add a sufficiently long absorption zone before the end of the domain to minimize reflections in the present study instead of introducing such a zone a convective outlet boundary condition bc was employed at the open end of the domain this reads 9 u t u c u 0 where u c is the convective velocity for the cases examined in the present study this approach was proven to be more effective than including an absorption zone after a series of preliminary tests it was concluded that for a solitary wave reflections were sufficiently absorbed by setting the convective velocity u c equal to the wave s celerity c s o l i t a r y of eq 8 the effectiveness of this approach for solitary waves is demonstrated in the validation and the results sections 3 and 4 a detailed investigation of the performance of this approach for waves other than solitary ones falls outside the scope of the present study 2 4 computational setup and definitions the computational domain used for the simulations performed in the present study is shown in fig 3 where the top sub figure shows the side view x y and the bottom one shows the top view x z of the setup h i is the height of the incident solitary wave and η x t is the free surface elevation at a specific location and time the computational domain width is denoted by l z and the total height of the wave flume is l y apart from setting values for d and s or e and ϵ which were defined in the introduction section the distance of the center of the pile breakwater from the beginning of the working section x p is also required to complete the description of the geometrical configuration used in the numerical simulations the bcs along the bottom and the top boundaries of the nwt were set to no slip and open respectively frantzis et al 2020 the latter ones correspond to homogeneous neumann conditions for all velocity components and constant dirichlet condition for pressure along the spanwise transverse direction periodic bcs were imposed to simulate the geometric repeatability of the breakwater texture as shown in fig 3 for the evaluation of the hydrodynamic behavior of a pile breakwater under the impact of a solitary wave the wave reflection and transmission coefficients were computed by measuring the corresponding wave heights the transmission and the reflection coefficients are defined as 10 k t h t h i 11 k r h r h i where h t is the transmitted wave height recorded in the leeward side by sensors w g 3 or w g 4 in fig 3 and h r is the reflected wave height recorded in the seaward side by sensors w g 1 or w g 2 the maximum run up on the pile is defined in a similar way by 12 k r u h r u h i where h r u is the maximum free surface elevation recorded by the elevation sensor w g 5 fig 3 another quantity of interest is the energy loss by the wave breakwater interaction the dimensionless total energy sum of potential and kinetic energy per unit crest width of a solitary wave is approximately given by sorensen 2006 13 e s o l i t 8 3 9 d 3 h d 3 2 using the conservation of energy the energy loss due to the interaction can be computed as e d e i e t e r where the subscripts i t and r refer to the incident transmitted and reflected wave respectively the corresponding energy loss coefficient k d is defined as 14 k d e d e i 1 k t 3 2 k r 3 2 it is noted that the energy in the transmitted and reflected waves is not accurately represented by eq 13 because their form includes additional secondary peaks in contrast to the intact solitary wave form therefore the energy loss coefficient k d of eq 14 which was also used in other studies liu et al 2011 is a rough estimation of the energy loss in the present study the exact amount of the energy loss was also calculated using a more rigorous definition approach as described and discussed in section 4 3 the results presented in the next sections sections 3 and 4 are in a non dimensional form for instance η u v and t are the non dimensional values of the free surface elevation streamwise velocity component spanwise velocity component and time respectively given by η η d u u g d v v g d and t t d g where η u v and t are the corresponding dimensional values of each quantity 3 validation the nwt used in the present study has been already validated for several test cases in frantzis et al 2020 in this section this nwt is further validated ensuring that it is an appropriate tool to study problems where a large solitary wave interacts with pile breakwaters for this configuration a limited number of experimental and numerical studies are available in the literature the case examined in jiang et al 2015 was selected because the incident wave height h i d 0 35 is within the nonlinear regime h i d 0 25 this study includes both experimental measurements and numerical results obtained by the waves2foam module of the widely used cfd software openfoam jacobsen 2017 jacobsen et al 2012 in the experimental setup the free surface elevation was recorded at two locations seawards w g 1 2 and two locations leewards w g 3 4 of the piles as indicated in fig 3 the streamwise and vertical components of the velocity in the water were measured at the seaward a d v 1 and the leeward a d v 2 side of the gap between piles as shown in fig 3 the locations of all the sensors with respect to the center of the middle pile are summarized in table 1 the set of parameters that correspond to the configuration of jiang et al 2015 are 15 r e ρ w d g d μ w 279152 h i 0 35 d d 0 25 d and s 0 4 d which correspond to a gap width of e 0 15 d and a porosity of ϵ 37 5 for the pile breakwater the incident wave height h i was obtained as the peak elevation recorded by the wave gauge w g 1 the experimental breakwater consisted of ten cylindrical piles confined in the transverse spanwise direction by the side walls of the wave tank to reduce the computational cost of the numerical simulations jiang et al 2015 truncated the computational domain to comprise five cylinders applying symmetric bcs along the transverse spanwise direction they reported that the run up profiles did not deviate significantly between the five cylinders justifying the use of a narrower domain in the present study a computational domain with a total length of l x 55 d and a height l y 2 d was used the wave maker zone extended from the beginning of the domain to 5 d in the streamwise direction and the relaxation zone extended for another 10 d comprising a wave generation relaxation zone of total length l r 15 d the center of the pile was located at a distance of x p 25 d from the end of the relaxation zone as indicated in fig 3 the effect of the size of the computational domain along the spanwise direction l z is presented in detail in section 3 1 the numerical grids used for the validation are presented in table 2 for all grids a constant grid spacing δ y and δ z was used along the vertical and the spanwise directions along the streamwise direction a uniform grid spacing of δ x m i n was used in the region 2 5 d 10 d with respect to the center of the circular piles before and after this region the grid was stretched with a linear factor of 1 03 the maximum grid spacing was restricted to δ x 4 δ x m i n the resulting grids consisted approximately from 1 2 up to 51 1 million cells the numerical grids m 1 and m 2 were used to assess the sensitivity of the results on the computational domain width l z which is discussed in section 3 1 the last three grids m 3 m 5 were used for the grid sensitivity analysis presented in section 3 2 3 1 effect of domain width in this section the effect of the domain width l z is examined by comparing the elevation and velocity signals using grids m 1 and m 2 the only difference between those two grids is the domain width which contains either one l z s or three cylindrical piles l z 3 s fig 4 presents the comparison of the two grids for the free surface elevation and velocity all signals were shifted in time in order to align t 0 with the maximum peak recorded by w g 1 for the predicted elevation signals it is hard to observe any differences between the two different domains for any of the two wave gauges located in the seaward fig 4a or the leeward fig 4b side the deviation on the computed transmitted and reflected crest elevations was about 0 1 between the two domains the same also applies for the streamwise u and vertical v components of the velocity even after the pile wave interaction i e the passage of the transmitted wave crest from the vicinity of the breakwater as shown in fig 4c after this event small differences were recorded at the leeward side by a d v 2 fig 4d when the transmitted wave crest had already traveled a distance of 3 d 12 d away from the breakwater according to these results a single pile simulation combined with periodic bcs is considered sufficient to provide accurate results for the wave breakwater interaction therefore for the simulations to follow a computational domain with a single pile l z s was considered for all cases in these simulations the periodicity was imposed at the central axes of two adjacent gaps similar to the schematic diagram of fig 3 3 2 grid sensitivity after justifying that simulations with a single pile provide proper results a grid independence study is presented in this section this was carried out to identify the minimum number of cells n g a p required to resolve the gap width e between two adjacent cylinders three different numerical grids were used for this purpose namely grids m 3 m 4 and m 5 as indicated in table 2 fig 5 shows the comparison of these three grids for the temporal variation of the free surface elevation in the seaward w g 1 2 and the leeward w g 3 4 side against the experimental measurements and the cfd results of jiang et al 2015 similar to the previous section t 0 refers to the time instant of maximum peak recording of w g 1 moreover due to the dissipation of energy during wave propagation the incident wave height h i recorded by the wave gauge w g 1 is slightly decreased compared to the generated wave height therefore in order to compare the three simulations in a consistent way the elevation signals η t were scaled with the corresponding peak value measured by w g 1 all numerical results were found in very good agreement between each other and in satisfactory agreement with the experimental measurements the largest difference with respect to the experimental measurements was the over prediction of the reflection coefficient k r second peak in the seaward side sensors w g 1 2 when the coarser grid m 5 was used k r was overpredicted approximately by 50 with respect to the experimental measurements and about 25 with respect to the other numerical results for the transmission coefficient k t first peak in the leeward side sensors w g 3 4 even with the coarser resolution m 5 the experimental value is underpredicted only by about 6 as shown in fig 5 increasing the resolution by using grids m 3 and m 4 an almost excellent agreement was achieved between the present model and the numerical results in jiang et al 2015 for the free surface elevation and the predicted coefficients k t and k r for the latter the resulting values of k t 0 865 and k r 0 155 deviate less than 1 and 5 respectively from the corresponding values in jiang et al 2015 the largest discrepancy between the present results and the numerical predictions using waves2foam jiang et al 2015 occurred at the tail of the transmitted solitary wave w g 3 and w g 4 this can be clearly observed at time instants around 32 for w g 3 and 27 for w g 4 this divergence originates from different wave absorption treatments adopted by the models in jiang et al 2015 a relatively short in terms of a solitary wave that has infinite wavelength absorption zone of 1 m i e 5 d was used leading to insufficient absorption of the transmitted wave and generating weak but not negligible wave reflection on the other hand in the current study a convective outlet bc for the velocity was employed section 2 3 which proved to be more appropriate for a solitary wave the absence of an absorption zone also leads to a shorter computational domain regarding the velocity signals at the seaward side locations both velocity components u and v are accurately captured by all grid resolutions as shown in figs 6a and 6b at these locations a converged solution was reached even with the coarser grid m 5 however this is not the case at the leeward side of the breakwater where the coarser grid was found to generate strong velocity oscillations after the passage of the wave crest these oscillations in the leeward side are attributed to the modeling of the sgs motions which are taken into account by the turbulence model in this region intense vortical motions in the wake disturb the flow locally amplifying the importance of the unresolved sgs of motion this explains why those oscillations are gradually diminished for the finer grids m 3 and m 4 it also explains the differences observed with respect to the numerical results in jiang et al 2015 where the les approach was also used with a different model for the contribution of the sgs scales namely an one equation model overall the free surface elevation and the coefficients k t and k r were found to be grid insensitive and to converge faster than the velocity components the velocity components would require an even finer numerical resolution to achieve grid convergence especially in the wake region after the passage of the transmitted wave crest since free surface elevation is the primary quantity of interest a grid resolution with 10 cells in the gap corresponding to slightly finer resolution than m 4 was considered as sufficient for the simulations performed in the next section 4 numerical results as mentioned in the introduction the main objective of the present study was to examine the effect of texture on the hydrodynamic behavior of the breakwater in a consistent and systematic way for a certain porosity value the geometrical parameter that defines texture is the ratio d d or s d in previous studies found in the literature this parameter has been investigated in the range d d 0 15 0 20 liu et al 2011 huang and yuan 2010 jiang et al 2015 by changing the water depth d in the present study the same water depth was maintained in all simulations so that the r e number was kept constant and equal to 50 1 0 3 a total of twelve cases were simulated as shown in table 3 corresponding to four different geometrical configurations and three different values of the incident wave height h i d 0 200 0 275 and 0 350 cases 4 9 were used to examine texture effects for a wide range of the parameter d d 0 2175 0 6525 using a porosity value of ϵ 27 5 for completeness cases 1 3 and 10 12 were also simulated to examine the effects of porosity on the deformation of the free surface the energy loss and the generated vorticity patterns compared to the validation case presented in section 3 lower values of the porosity were examined in this section this choice is justified by the objective to examine breakwaters that can achieve lower values of the transmission coefficient compared to the validation case jiang et al 2015 presented in the previous section in terms of computational cost the cases presented here are more challenging because reduced values of porosity are associated with increased resolution requirements and higher velocities in the gap region following the analysis of section 3 1 a single cylinder with periodic bcs along the spanwise direction was considered for all cases therefore the width of the computational domain was always equal to l z s the length and height of the computational domain were set in all cases equal to l x 35 d and l y 2 2 d respectively according to the schematic diagram of fig 3 in all cases the center of the pile was placed at a distance of x p 25 d and the length of the wave generation zone was set equal to l g 15 d in order to minimize grid resolution effects among different cases all simulations were performed using the same grid spacing the grid resolution was decided according to the grid sensitivity analysis performed in section 3 2 along the spanwise direction a fixed grid spacing δ z d 160 was set according to the worst case scenario of the lowest porosity cases 1 3 so that at least ten grid cells were used to resolve the gap between the piles n g a p 10 in table 3 the grid spacing was also uniform along the vertical direction equal to δ y d 100 for all cases along the streamwise direction a minimum grid spacing of δ x m i n d 160 was used in the region 2 d to 3 2 d with respect to the center of the pile before and after this region the grid was expanded with a linear stretching factor of 1 03 until δ x 4 δ x m i n using these spacing distances a grid consisting of 2111 220 48 cells was used for the cases with s d 0 3 and a grid of 2111 220 144 cells for the cases with s d 0 9 the hydrodynamic behavior of the pile breakwater in terms of the coefficients of transmission k t reflection k r energy loss k d and maximum run up k r u is presented and discussed in section 4 1 the free surface profiles around the pile at the moment of maximum run up are shown in section 4 2 sections 4 3 4 5 focus on the wave breakwater interaction by analyzing the wave energy loss the 3d evolution of the free surface and the evolution of the vorticity fields in the water respectively 4 1 hydrodynamic behavior of the breakwater the hydrodynamic behavior of the pile breakwater in terms of k t and k r was examined by measuring the free surface elevation before and after the breakwater the two wave gauges w g 1 and w g 4 in fig 3 were intentionally placed sufficiently far from the breakwater so that a 2d profile of the free surface elevation was recovered with negligible deviations along the spanwise direction in the worst case scenario where d 0 6525 d these locations are about 11 5 d away from the center of the cylinder moreover an additional wave gauge w g 5 was placed just before the cylinder to record the run up at the seaward side the locations of these three sensors are shown in table 4 due to small deviations from the targeted and the generated waves the first peak measured by w g 1 was defined as the incident wave height and was also used to normalize all the relevant signals making the different cases comparable as an example fig 7 shows the normalized free surface elevation recorded by w g 1 w g 4 and w g 5 for the coarse texture cases with ϵ 27 5 figs 7a and 7b depict how the reflected and transmitted waves were measured for each case respectively in addition fig 7c shows the free surface elevation exactly before the pile w g 5 seaward side which indicates the maximum run up on the pile the coefficients k t k r k d and k r u for all the cases with fine texture s 0 3 d are shown in fig 8 as a function of porosity for different wave heights the results presented in fig 8 are consistent with previously reported results the effect of porosity on k t and k r figs 8a and 8b is as expected with the coefficients following an opposite trend as the porosity increases as far as the energy loss coefficient k d is concerned fig 8c it was found to be reducing with higher porosity in agreement with results reported for regular waves isaacson et al 1998 regarding the maximum dimensionless run up k r u this was also found to be reducing with higher porosity values as it was also observed in yao et al 2017 where a solitary wave was interacting with a double row pile breakwater of circular cross sections as far as the effect of the incident wave height nonlinearity is concerned k t follows a decreasing trend while k r shows an increasing albeit weaker trend with increasing h i d k r u and k d also show an increasing trend with increasing h i d this observation is consistent with the reported effect of h i on k d for similar configurations under regular huang 2007b or solitary liu et al 2011 waves therefore one may conclude that k r k r u and k d follow the same behavior in terms of pile porosity and incident wave height variations with k r mostly depending on porosity while k t following the opposite trend as already mentioned the effect of texture was not adequately examined in the past only two studies liu et al 2011 huang and yuan 2010 examined this parameter by reducing the depth in their experiments varying the texture parameter d d but in a quite narrow range of 0 15 0 20 inevitably leading to negligible differences in the present study the effect of the texture was examined in a systematic way for the medium value of the porosity ϵ 27 5 and a texture parameter d d that ranged between 0 2175 0 6525 the comparative results between the two textures are presented in fig 9 for a specific value of porosity ϵ a finer texture corresponds to a breakwater consisting of more piles with a smaller diameter d d such a regime corresponds to the fine texture cases 7 9 of table 3 where three times thinner cylinders occupy the same width in comparison to the coarse texture cases 4 6 for the same value of porosity ϵ 27 5 as shown in fig 9 the fine texture was found to increase k d by 20 when h i is close to the linear regime while this increase reached about 30 for h i 0 35 d this behavior was anticipated because a breakwater with a finer texture contains more gaps that generate more vortices interacting with each other at closer distances to each other amplifying the energy loss under these conditions a reduction in the k t is also expected for finer texture cases as demonstrated in fig 9 this was indeed the case with an almost constant reduction of about 2 5 for all values of h i d examined although k t and k r usually have an adverse behavior a reduction of k r was also noticed with the fine texture especially for larger values of h i d up to 6 for h i 0 35 d moreover due to the leeward side vortices k t would be expected to be more sensitive to texture than k r interestingly enough this was not the case in the nonlinear regime i e at higher values of h i d as far as the texture effect on k r u is concerned no significant variation was observed in the linear regime on the other hand an increased value of about 5 5 was observed for the larger wave height of h i 0 35 d as it will be shown later this behavior is attributed to nonlinear effects such as free surface breaking which are amplified for larger incoming wave heights in addition k r u shows an adverse behavior to that of k r this was an unexpected result because k r u and k r have a similar trend as a function of other parameters such as ϵ and h i d it is also interesting to mention that k r u and k d follow always the same trend with changing any parameter showing that the increase of energy loss is always resulting to larger values of run up 4 2 run up profiles in this section the free surface elevation profile around the pile is presented at the moment of maximum run up k r u this time instant was identified for each case using the temporal evolution of the free surface elevation at the sensor w g 5 as shown in fig 7c the recorded elevation of the free surface profile around the perimeter of the pile is shown in fig 10 the leeward and seaward points are identified as 0 and 180 respectively for the fine texture cases figs 10a and 10b the variation of run up along the perimeter r u θ η θ h i are similar mainly characterized by three regions in the first region the run up around the pile remains almost constant from the front point 180 to the side point 90 of the pile perimeter in the second region the elevation drops to its minimum value at about 30 finally in the third region the run up slightly increases towards the leeward point 0 with an almost constant value around it for the coarse texture case black line in fig 10c the elevation drops faster from the front point 180 of the pile perimeter to the side point 90 until reaching its minimum value at about 30 45 the exact location of the point depends on h i after that point the run up increases towards the leeward point 0 where a local maximum is formed for increasing porosity ϵ fig 10a the run up on the cylinder decreases at the seaward point 180 and increases at the leeward point 0 an opposite trend was found for the effect of the wave height h i fig 10b for increasing wave height the run up at the seaward and leeward points was found to increase and decrease respectively the minimum run up value was found to behave similarly with the run up at the leeward point 0 for both ϵ and h i regarding the texture this was found to affect the run up in a different manner compared to ϵ and h i for example as shown in fig 10c the maximum run up at 180 was not significantly affected by texture texture effects were mainly identified along the leeward side of the pile in the coarse texture case black line in fig 10c from case p 2 n 1 h 3 in table 3 the run up was significantly increased at the leeward side 0 the minimum run up at about 45 followed an adverse behavior reducing its value and moving towards the seaward side at this location the first derivative of r u θ r u θ θ rapidly changed sign indicating an almost vertical free surface profile which is close to its breaking 4 3 energy loss in this section the temporal evolution of the wave energy loss is calculated in a rigorous manner by taking into account the total volume of water and its velocity field the total mechanical energy of the wave e t o t is defined as the sum of the potential e p and the kinetic e k energy in the absence of surface tension forces these terms are calculated by the volume integrals 16 e p t 1 f r w t y d v and e k t 1 2 w t u t 2 d v where w t is the water volume of the working section of the nwt the region of the artificial thickness of the interface where the density changes is excluded from the integration to avoid spurious velocity components iafrati 2011 iafrati et al 2014 sensible conclusions on the evolution of the wave energy can only be drawn by examining the time interval for which almost all the wave energy is contained within the working section this time interval depends on the wave celerity which depends on the wave height to define an appropriate time interval simulations for an undisturbed solitary wave were performed fig 11 shows the temporal evolution of the total energy e t o t per crest width l z for different wave heights before and after the passage of the solitary wave from the working section t t 1 and t t 4 respectively for h i 0 2 d the total energy corresponds to the potential energy of the still water column e t o t t 0 e p t 0 which is termed as the background energy e b g the useful time interval for each case corresponds to the region where the total energy reaches a plateau e g t 2 t 3 for h i 0 2 d the difference between the maximum value of the graph and the e b g defines the energy content of the incident wave e w a v e h i as indicated in fig 11 for higher values of h i the energy content of the wave is increased moving also t 2 and t 3 at earlier time instants the moment t h i when the wave crest was located at the location of w g 1 is indicated with black solid circles in fig 11 according to fig 7a t h i 20 65 20 00 and 19 50 for h i 0 200 d 0 275 d and 0 350 d respectively in order to focus on the useful part of this graph the time interval where e t o t of the free wave was almost constant was isolated thus a specific time interval of t 2 t 3 was chosen according to the incident wave height h i of each case following fig 11 the dimensionless time intervals for the cases with h i 0 2 d 0 275 d and 0 35 d were chosen to be 26 0 31 0 24 5 30 5 and 23 5 29 5 respectively moreover in order to make the results of all cases comparable the energy difference with respect to the maximum content in each case was calculated as a percentage of the corresponding e w a v e h i simulated i e 17 δ e w a v e t e t o t t e t o t t 2 e w a v e h i therefore the corresponding energy loss in each case is given by δ e w a v e the most important mechanisms that are responsible for the increased loss of the solitary wave energy excluding the flow friction on the pile surface are koraim 2014 i the contraction and acceleration of the flow in order to pass through the slots small gaps ii the formation of vortices in the leeward side of the structure iii the generation and the enhancement of turbulence due to flow separation and iv the violent free surface motion and the occurrence of wave free surface breaking the temporal evolution of δ e w a v e of each case simulated is shown in fig 12 isolating the time interval of interest i e t 2 t 3 it is noted that the loss of the wave energy is displayed without distinguishing the effect of the different mechanisms the results presented in fig 12 support the more generic results presented in figs 8 and 9 that refer to the energy loss coefficient k d of the pile breakwater which is only based on the transmitted and reflected wave heights it is again observed that the energy loss amplifies for lower ϵ higher h i d and finer texture 4 4 free surface deformation in this section it is attempted to explain the energy loss behavior presented in the previous section by analyzing the free surface deformation detailed 3d profiles of the free surface motion during the overturning and breaking processes are presented and discussed in terms of varying wave height porosity and texture the relevant snapshots are accompanied with the corresponding energy loss curves in the water as calculated in the previous section it has to be noted that very fine free surface deformations such as droplets and bubbles which are smaller than the spatial numerical resolution are not captured according to deane and stokes 2002 bubbles larger than the hinze scale 1 mm are subjected to fragmentation while smaller bubbles tend to be stable because of surface tension forces based on the parameters used in the present study the minimum grid size corresponds to 0 635 mm even though this is almost half the value of the minimum bubble size such details cannot be resolved due to the smoothing of the properties around the interface and the absence of surface tension effects to capture the smallest bubbles with pure air in their core at least five times smaller grid cells would be required even with the use of the efficient nwt adopted in the present study the total computational cost for such a simulation would be prohibitive before proceeding to the comparisons between cases case p 2 n 1 h 2 will be presented in detail to demonstrate a typical interaction of the incoming wave with the breakwater fig 13 shows snapshots of the free surface profile at nine characteristic time instants along with the corresponding wave energy loss graph according to the results in fig 13 the free surface first rises at both seaward and leeward side of the pile when the incident wave crest reaches the vicinity of the pile in the seaward side of the pile the free surface rises faster resulting a much higher peak elevation compared to the leeward side of the pile t 24 50 26 75 figs 13a 13d at the same time during t 25 25 26 75 figs 13b 13d the free surface in the leeward side starts a backward overturning process and its front becomes almost vertical slightly before the occurrence of the maximum run up k r u at t 26 5 this process is responsible for air entrapment due to free surface breaking and the formation of an air pocket which occurs just after the cylindrical pile and extends in the spanwise direction for a length that is about two times the gap distance e water passes through the gap with high streamwise velocities drifting air into the air pocket for as long as the pocket is open and connected with the free surface the air pocket closes and completely detaches from the free surface during its downward motion at the seaward side of the pile t 28 25 fig 13f afterwards the air pocket is transported in the streamwise direction penetrating deeper while rotating counter clockwise with respect to the spanwise axis t 29 fig 13g following the formation of this air pocket a secondary air pocket which is elongated in the streamwise direction is developed due to the high streamwise velocities that still exist in the gap however the secondary air pocket lasts for a considerably shorter period of time compared to the main one since it experiences very quick fragmentation this secondary air pocket is formed in the gap region t 28 25 29 75 figs 13f 13h while the wave crest travels away from the vicinity of the pile the velocities constantly decrease as a result the transport of the first air pocket terminates and starts moving backwards and upwards t 29 75 fig 13h due to buoyancy the reverse motion of the first air pocket is responsible for its disintegration which leads to air pocket remnants that slowly move upwards allowing the air to escape t 30 5 fig 13i it is noted that the air pockets and bubbles which become smaller than the grid size are removed from the simulation nevertheless this has no effect on the predicted hydrodynamic behavior of the breakwater since the primary wave breaking is accurately captured and the remaining flow energy in the vicinity of the pile will eventually be dissipated comparing the free surface profile at the location of the two gaps where the periodic bc is applied it is observed that symmetry is maintained up to the time instant before the formation of the main air pocket after that time instant symmetry is lost and as consequence the periodic bc might affect the results by suppressing flow and free surface structures however this numerical treatment might affect only the smaller less important structures that are driven by turbulence and does not affect the main structures that are generated by the geometrical configuration moreover the transmitted and reflected crests that contain most of the wave s energy have traveled away from the area where the periodicity affects the results this also explains the almost identical results found in section 3 1 in summary the main stages experienced by the free surface deformation when a solitary wave interacts with a pile breakwater are 1 undisturbed wave form 2 run up on the pile 3 backward overturning of the free surface at the leeward side 4 generation of a backwards oriented free surface bulge located off center of the pile 5 formation of an air pocket which is elongated in the spanwise direction 6 transport of the air pocket leewards and downwards while rotating around the spanwise axis 7 formation of a secondary air pocket closer to the pile 8 transmitted and reflected crests are separated 9 upward and backward motion of the air pockets that are subsequently disintegrated and form a cloud of bubbles 10 entrapped air escapes 11 oscillatory free surface motion until the remaining energy in the vicinity of the pile is dissipated as far as the dissipation rate is concerned high values were identified during the overturning motion of the free surface and before the first air pocket was fully closed t 26 27 5 dissipation becomes almost zero after the fragmentation of the air pockets stage 9 the effect of the breakwater porosity on the free surface deformation is shown in fig 14 for the higher value of h i d 0 350 and the fine texture it is observed that the air pockets generated in all cases penetrate approximately to the same depth regarding both the first t 25 75 figs 14a 14d 14g or the second t 27 50 figs 14b 14e 14h air entrapment events the slightly increased energy loss observed in smaller porosity values could be a result of two factors first the reduced gap leads to increased velocities that allow the formation of more energetic bubbles these bubbles are transported faster to reach the location of the transmitted crest t 28 25 fig 14i in combination with the reduced transmission which results in a lower and slower transmitted wave a more energetic bubble interacts and dissipates energy in the high energy density area of the crest region iafrati 2011 the enhanced energy loss observed at lower porosity values is also partially attributed to the amplified shear forces in the gap region and to the higher velocities that are developed due to the intensive contraction of the flow next the effect of the breakwater texture at different values of the incident wave height is analyzed starting with the smallest wave height examined h i d 0 200 which is closer to the linear regime fig 15 shows the free surface profile at three characteristic time instants for both the fine figs 15a 15c and the coarse figs 15d 15f texture cases it is observed that the first air entrapment occurs at about the same time t 28 50 figs 15b and 15e in both cases the air pocket formed in the coarse texture case penetrates deeper compared to the one in the fine texture case as clearly indicated by figs 15c and 15f it is also observed that an earlier free surface breaking event is initiated in the fine texture case t 27 50 fig 15a but it does not result in the formation of an air pocket the free surface became almost vertical but the flow passing through the gap is not fast enough to accelerate air below the bulge and fold the free surface to form an air pocket as far as the texture effect in the highly nonlinear regime h i d 0 350 is concerned both coarse and fine texture cases experience an intense air entrapment event at about t 27 5 as shown in figs 16b and 16e in the fine texture case though an earlier air entrapment is induced forming a smaller air pocket this is clearly indicated at t 26 0 in fig 16 where the air pocket of the coarse texture case fig 16d is not fully closed while in the fine texture case fig 16a the first air entrapment event was completed and the second one is in progress moreover it is observed that the air pockets developed in the coarse texture case penetrate deeper compared to the ones developed in the fine texture case summarizing the observations for the texture effect at both small and large wave heights one would expect an increased energy loss for the coarse texture case due to the deeper penetration of the air pockets as observed by chanson and jaw fang 1997 however in the fine texture case a higher energy dissipation rate develops for the cases examined here in the highly nonlinear regime of h i d 0 350 the energy dissipated in the fine texture case was approximately twice the energy dissipated in the coarse texture this is attributed to the fact that an additional earlier air entrapment event occurs in the fine texture as a result in the fine texture case an air entrapment event occurs closer to the wave crest where higher energy density exists enhancing dissipation moreover the first breaking event of the fine texture case takes place before the instant of maximum k r u initiating the energy dissipation process before the completion of the wave reflection thus increasing the dissipation of the reflected wave for the coarse texture case the air entrapment process starts after the occurrence of the maximum k r u allowing the reflected crest to avoid the dissipation process this could also be the explanation for the stronger texture effect on the reflection coefficient k r compared to the one on the transmission coefficient k t as shown in fig 9 distinct differences on the free surface deformation also appear when the incident wave height increases air entrapment events were present even for the smaller wave height examined in this study however their size and intensity amplify when the wave height increases for example in the coarse texture case examined the size and the spanwise extend of the main i e larger air pocket increase for larger incident wave height according to figs 15f and 16f the air entrapment takes place in a very short spanwise length when h i d 0 200 while in the case of h i d 0 350 the air pocket covers almost all the domain width regarding the fine texture case the generation of an additional air pocket was observed at earlier time instants when the incident wave height increases as indicated by comparing figs 15a and 16a this earlier air entrapment event was initiated in the low wave height as well since the free surface became almost vertical but it was not completed to form an air pocket 4 5 vorticity generation as demonstrated in the previous section the nonlinear interaction of solitary waves with the pile breakwater leads to a complex evolution of the free surface which folds backwards against the wave direction resulting to crest breaking and air entrapment events in the leeward side these mechanisms generate spanwise vortices that are responsible for the vorticity transport in deeper locations and the enhancement of the wave energy dissipation moreover vertical vortices are generated due to flow separation on the piles in order to exploit further the wave structure interaction and the mechanisms of energy dissipation the behavior of the spanwise and vertical vorticity components is analyzed and discussed in a qualitative manner 4 5 1 spanwise vorticity the generation and evolution of the spanwise vorticity ω z is presented considering two characteristic x y planes the middle plane intersecting the center of the cylinder and the gap plane intersecting the center of the gap the porosity effect on the generation and evolution of the ω z is displayed in fig 17 for the larger wave height h i d 0 350 although the transmitted energy and mass are much lower with lower porosities higher velocities are observed due to the stronger acceleration and contraction of the flow through the gap as a result the leeward side wake vortices are transported further downstream as porosity increases leading to lower levels of vorticity in the region immediate leewards of the pile this is clearly indicated in the middle plane of both cases in fig 17b at t 29 in addition due to the increased velocity in the low porosity case both bottom and free surface generated vortices in the gap plane are pushed faster upwards and downwards respectively as a consequence these two vortices meet approximately at mid depth earlier t 27 in fig 17b the texture effect is firstly examined for the case of the large wave height h i d 0 350 where the differences are more distinguishable fig 18 presents characteristic time instants starting from the moment of maximum run up which occurs at t 26 for both coarse and fine texture cases according to these results it is evident that the vorticity of the fine texture develops earlier compared to the coarse one as indicated at t 27 this happens due to the occurrence of the first air entrapment event in the fine texture case before the free surface reaches its maximum run up it is shown at t 26 in fig 18a that the air pocket in the fine texture case was already formed before the time of maximum run up on the other hand the first air entrapment event in the coarse texture case occurs long after that instant at about t 27 in fig 18b by that time the initially developed vorticity in the fine texture case is convected and diffused further downstream downwards and in the transverse direction at the same time the second air entrapment event which is the stronger one is in progress since the wave celerity of the transmitted wave is almost the same for the two textures the transmitted wave crest is at the same position for identical time instants as shown in fig 18 thus in the fine texture case both air entrapment and increased vorticity are generated and interact closer to the transmitted crest enhancing the dissipation rate differences also arise on the vorticity that originates from the bed boundary layer regarding the fine texture case a growing vorticity region is developing along the bed in the gap plane at t 26 fig 18a at t 27 this vorticity region grows in the streamwise direction and penetrates to the middle plane on the other hand the bed vorticity in the coarse texture case shown in fig 18b is weaker taking also into account the larger distance between the gap and middle planes in the coarse texture case it takes longer for the vorticity that is generated at the gap plane to reach the middle plane compared to the fine texture case after the passage of the wave the remaining vortices in the vicinity of the pile are slowly spread in all directions attenuating due to diffusion and vortical interaction for both textures shown in fig 18 the generated vorticity has reached the same streamwise distance of about 2 d leewards of the pile center before it practically vanishes further downstream in the same manner the texture effect for the low wave height case of h i d 0 200 is given in fig 19 starting at t 28 0 which is slightly after the occurrence of maximum run up t 27 5 the behavior is similar to the one of the large wave height fig 18 albeit with reduced vorticity intensity it is important to mention that vorticity in the gap plane is generated at about the same time in both fine and coarse texture cases when the incident wave height is smaller as indicated at t 30 in figs 19a and 19b as expected due to lower velocities the vortices traveled to a shorter streamwise distance of about 1 5 d with respect to the center of the pile focusing on the last snapshot of each case t 34 in fig 19 and t 31 in fig 18 the earlier development and the homogenization of vorticity in the fine texture is compared to the vorticity behavior in the coarse texture for instance in the fine texture case vorticity covers almost the whole area in the vicinity of the pile while in the coarse texture case the bed and free surface vorticity fields just intersect at approximately mid depth the current observations of faster regularization and homogenization of the leeward side wake vorticity when smaller gaps are used i e fine texture are in agreement with the data reported in molin 2011 summarizing figs 17 18 shown in this section it is manifested that strong spanwise vorticity is generated at the free surface only after an air entrapment event is completed forming a closed air pocket similar observations were noted for regular breaking waves in iafrati 2011 even though the levels of ω z are very low before that instant the dissipation is already active according to fig 12 after the main wave pile interaction and the escape of the entrapped air most of the energy has traveled away along with the transmitted and reflected crests thus the termination of the dissipation process is observed fig 12 even though a weaker dissipation procedure continues due to the attenuation of the remaining vorticity in the vicinity of the pile 4 5 2 vertical vorticity in this section the evolution of the vertical vorticity ω y is presented and discussed for one porosity case ϵ 27 5 the larger value of the solitary wave height h i d 0 350 and both fine and coarse texture contours of ω y are presented in horizontal x z planes located at elevations y 0 015 0 500 0 700 0 900 above the seabed the temporal evolution of the ω y is presented at t 25 27 29 and 31 in figs 20 21 22 and 23 respectively comparing the two texture cases the most evident difference is that the primary vorticity patterns are more elongated for the finer texture case according to fig 20 that refers to t 25 it is confirmed that the development of the vorticity in the fine texture case occurs much earlier than that of the coarse texture one however at t 25 the first air pocket is not completely closed allowing for a well organized anti symmetric vertical vorticity field according to the findings of section 4 5 1 spanwise vorticity was generated at the free surface and the bed and transported towards mid depth distorting the well organized vertical vorticity thus the well organized ω y field breaks sooner at locations near the free surface and the bed compared to the mid depth locations y 0 5 in fig 21 moreover noting that the maximum run up occurs at t 26 in both cases and the location of the crests are almost identical it is concluded that the reflected and transmitted crests in the fine texture case are closer to the region of intense ω y it is reminded that the locations of the fine texture crests are also closer to the region of intense ω z as observed in section 4 5 1 in addition regarding the coarse texture case it is again observed that the region close to the middle of the pile toe and below y 0 5 remains unaffected by the high vorticity levels e g at t 29 and 31 in contrast to the fine texture case to conclude the last time instant fig 23 demonstrates the faster diffusion of the vorticity and the faster homogenization of the flow when smaller gaps fine texture are used molin 2011 also observed in section 4 5 1 5 conclusions the interaction of a solitary wave with a single row pile breakwater of circular cross section was studied by a series of simulations using an efficient nwt that is capable of capturing complex and nonlinear phenomena such as the free surface breaking the developed numerical model was firstly validated showing very good agreement against experimental and numerical data available in the literature the effects of breakwater porosity and pile diameter texture as well as incident wave height on the transmission reflection and energy loss coefficients were presented the run up profile around the pile the evolution of the free surface and the generated vorticity fields were also presented and discussed the present study emphasized on the texture pile diameter effect revealing deviations on the hydrodynamic behavior of the breakwater i e coefficients k t k r k d and k r u the differences between textures were found to amplify for larger values of the incident wave height for h i 0 35 d comparing two textures with pile diameter of d and 3 d and the same porosity the corresponding values of k t k r and k r u present maximum differences of about 5 in the finer texture case k d was found to be larger by about 20 than in the coarse texture one in the linear regime h i 0 2 d this difference increased further in the nonlinear regime reaching about 30 larger values for h i 0 35 d it was also found that both k t and k r decrease when using a finer texture even though one would expect an opposite behavior for k r moreover k t was found to be more insensitive than k r to texture effects which was an unexpected result one would expect the opposite behavior because the flow field in the leeward side where k t is measured changes drastically e g air entrapment and vorticity behavior when the texture changes while the flow field differences found in the seaward side are minimal an additional unforeseen result regarding the texture effect was the opposite behavior between k r u and k r despite the fact that both share the same trend when other parameters porosity or wave height change the above observations and results were explained by analyzing the free surface deformation the wave energy loss and the generated vorticity during the wave structure interaction the pile breakwaters could effectively be used for the protection against tsunami type waves especially in regions where a rubble mound breakwater is not a practical solution even though pile breakwaters cannot totally dissipate the energy of a tsunami wave sufficient reduction on the transmitted wave can be achieved while the water renewal in their leeward side is

21717,interactions of solitary waves with slotted breakwaters comprising a single row of vertical circular piles was studied using a numerical wave tank nwt based on the navier stokes equations the nwt combines the immersed boundary method to impose boundary conditions on solid surfaces the level set method to track the free surface and a fast poisson solver achieving efficient simulations the nwt was validated by comparisons to experimental and numerical data in the literature subsequently the assessment of the hydrodynamic behavior of the breakwater was carried out examining different values of incident wave height h i pile diameter d distance between piles s and spacing between piles e s d it was found that for constant d and decreasing e s the wave run up k r u reflection k r and energy loss k d coefficients increase while the transmission coefficient k t decreases also for constant e s and d increasing h i resulted into the increase of k r k r u and k d but the decrease of k t moreover for constant e s smaller d leads to increased k r u and k d and decreased k r and k t these trends amplify when h i increases to explain the effect of the geometric parameters wave breaking air entrapment and vorticity generation were examined in the vicinity of the piles keywords slotted breakwater solitary wave wave reflection and transmission wave breaking and energy loss vorticity generation efficient numerical wave tank 1 introduction the primary function of breakwaters is the protection of ports and coasts by dissipating and or reflecting the incident wave energy in their seaward region and by reducing wave transmission in their leeward region typical breakwaters either rubble mound or vertical front ones achieve this task by presenting a continuous barrier to the incident waves which in many occasions results into undesirable levels of wave refection in their seaward region and or undesirable environmental issues like the non renewal of water in their leeward region an alternative to rubble mound or vertical front breakwaters are a the perforated front breakwaters with an impermeable back wall and b the slotted breakwaters without a back wall a detailed literature review on these types of breakwater is found in huang et al 2011 and koraim 2014 in both cases the perforated slotted wall consists of rows of vertical or horizontal piles of circular or rectangular cross section here we focus on slotted breakwaters with a single row of vertical piles of circular cross section and a smooth surface as shown schematically in fig 1a the definitions of the main geometrical parameters of such structures are illustrated in fig 1b where d is the pile diameter s is the distance between the centers of adjacent piles e s d is the gap between adjacent piles and the porosity of the perforated wall is defined as ϵ e s compared to rubble mound and vertical front breakwaters the slotted breakwaters may present reduced wave reflection in their seaward region and simultaneously reduced wave transmission and sufficient water renewal and littoral drift in their leeward region in order to achieve optimum behavior both in their seaward and leeward regions the design of slotted breakwaters should be based on accurate predictions of the interaction between the relevant wave processes and flow behavior in the vicinity of the piles configurations comprising multiple rows and combinations of these vertical pile walls have been considered according to the application and the desired hydrodynamic behavior the interaction between waves and closely spaced vertical cylindrical piles is a challenging case to study in detail presenting similar characteristics difficulties with other wave structure interaction problems wave run up wave breaking and flow separation are highly nonlinear and complex phenomena that may simultaneously occur during the interaction of waves with vertical piles in general the understanding of the nonlinear interactions between waves and marine structures is one of the most challenging fields in ocean engineering using either experimental theoretical or numerical approaches for their analysis the analytical theoretical approaches involve numerous assumptions which can only be justified for simplified cases where strong nonlinearities are absent on the other hand experimental studies can provide significant insight into the relevant physical phenomena however quantities of interest such as velocity components or detailed free surface elevations are difficult to measure in detail in a non intrusive manner the numerical study of these problems using computational fluid dynamics cfd models is a challenging task mainly because of the significant computational resources required among different numerical models to study complex flows with wave breaking the fully nonlinear potential flow models can efficiently and accurately predict the occurrence of breaking iafrati et al 2014 however those models are not able to provide any information after the breaking point where the energy dissipation is enhanced iafrati 2011 for problems where both wave breaking and flow separation are present the most general and accurate numerical approach is the solution of the three dimensional 3d navier stokes ns equations this involves the transient solution of an incompressible turbulent flow of two immiscible fluids water and air the continuous evolution in computing power together with recent developments in efficient computational algorithms dodd and ferrante 2014 frantzis and grigoriadis 2019 make ns based simulations even more attractive nowadays allowing detailed and accurate parametric studies for these challenging flow problems the hydrodynamic behavior of slotted breakwaters with vertical piles under regular waves has been mostly studied experimentally and theoretically experimental measurements for circular and rectangular piles were performed by kakuno and liu 1993 who also developed a theoretical method of matched asymptotic expansions including an empirical model to account for the dissipation effect to calculate the transmission and reflection coefficients k t and k r experimental results showed that the energy loss coefficient k d was almost independent of the reynolds r e and keulegan carpenter numbers when their values are in the ranges 2 4 1 0 3 1 5 1 0 4 and 0 35 3 4 respectively in a similar manner the forces acting on pile breakwaters were examined in kriebel 1993 and kakuno et al 1996 according to their results the streamwise force on a pile is mostly independent of the relative depth when the breakwater porosity is small and nearly constant when the porosity exceeds 50 moreover it was concluded that wave transmission decreases for shallow water and increasing wave steepness other analytical studies suh et al 2011 zhu 2011 zhu et al 2015 investigated the hydrodynamic behavior of slotted breakwaters with single row piles of rectangular cross section showing that they operate as low pass filters it was also found that wave transmission for long waves i e for s λ 1 where λ is the wave length is enhanced when the thickness of the slotted wall is increased i e when the streamwise length of the rectangular cross section is larger than the spanwise width experimental measurements for a two row pile breakwater configuration were performed in huang 2007c showing that minimum reflection is achieved when the streamwise distance between the two rows is one fourth of the incident wave length experiments to study the effect of an opposing current to the wave scattering were carried out in huang 2007a and demonstrate a remarkably decreased transmission compared to the absence of a current other studies found in the literature examined the hydrodynamic behavior of pile breakwaters under irregular waves isaacson et al 1998 park et al 2000 and the effect of the draft level of the piles i e for cases where the piles do not reach the seabed the slotted vertical pile breakwater is also used as protection against tsunami waves because it effectively reduces the transmitted energy of long waves huang and yuan 2010 when small porosity values are employed this characteristic becomes more important when a tsunami early warning system is not triggered by a small amplitude wave which could still cause damages to facilities in the leeward region e g harbour tsunami waves behave in a completely different way compared to regular or irregular waves especially if we take into account their magnitude and transformation while interacting with structures therefore the design of a pile breakwater should not be merely based on the effect of regular and irregular waves but tsunami type waves as well previous works intended to study tsunami type waves used the solitary wave theory because it represents important properties of the leading part of a real tsunami wave lin 2004 an important difference between a solitary wave and a tsunami wave is the absence in the former of negative free surface elevation i e below the still water level therefore solitary waves do not fully represent actual tsunami conditions but they have been used as an approximated form of tsunami waves madsen et al 2008 in fact solitary waves have been widely used in numerical and experimental studies approximating tsunami waves because they can be easily generated by conventional wavemakers rossetto et al 2011 the interaction of pile breakwaters with solitary waves was firstly studied in huang and yuan 2010 providing experimental measurements for piles of circular cross section three values of porosity two values of water depth d and a range of incident wave height h i d 0 2 0 6 were examined the results were compared against predictions of the long wave approximation huang 2007c showing a good overall agreement for k t while k r was accurately predicted only for smaller wave heights i e h i d 0 2 the experimental measurements in huang and yuan 2010 were later used in liu et al 2011 to examine the suitability of depth averaged shallow water equations to predict the coefficients k t and k r it was concluded that this set of equations can provide accurate predictions only when h i d 0 25 where the nonlinear interactions are weaker the main reason for the inaccuracy of both long wave approximation and depth averaged shallow water equations in cases of large wave heights is their inability to account for wave breaking phenomena that also lead to air entrapment and enhancement of the nonlinearities using the 3d ns equations to capture phenomena such as air entrapment jiang et al 2015 numerically studied the interaction between solitary waves and a single row pile breakwater results for a single set of geometrical parameters and a single wave height of h i d 0 35 within the highly nonlinear regime were provided and compared with experimental measurements performed in the same study the evolutionary behavior of the wave run up was discussed the study also focused on the comparison against the single isolated pile results in terms of wave run up profile around the pile vortex generation in the wake and impact force the results of the ns model showed a significant improvement on the prediction of k t compared to previous simpler models however k r was still slightly overpredicted subsequently ns based numerical simulations were also performed in yao et al 2017 for a two row configuration in the same study experimental measurements were also performed to validate a part of the numerical predictions results showed very good agreement for both k t and k r as well as for other quantities such as velocity components and dynamic pressure evolution the variation of the wave run up distribution and the forces acting on the front and back row of piles were also examined as a function of the incident wave height h i and the porosity ϵ it was concluded that increasing the wave height leads to increased values of dimensionless wave run up and reduced dimensionless wave forces according to the existing literature and the evaluation of the numerical results in jiang et al 2015 and yao et al 2017 it is evident that the two fluid 3d ns based numerical wave tank nwt is the only model that can provide accurate predictions on the hydrodynamic behavior of pile breakwaters especially for cases where highly nonlinear phenomena occur dissipation processes can be modeled very accurately since the viscous and other effects from complex phenomena such as turbulent vortices droplets and air pockets formed by wave breaking can be captured in the present study the efficient ns based nwt presented in frantzis et al 2020 was selected to investigate the nonlinear interaction between solitary waves of large height and single row pile breakwaters of circular cross section the effect of the pile diameter was examined for different porosity and incident wave height values keeping the water depth constant previous experimental studies liu et al 2011 huang and yuan 2010 found that k r and k t are nearly independent of the pile diameter to depth ratio d d in these experiments though the value of d d varied in a very narrow range of 0 15 0 20 inevitably resulting into negligible differences moreover in these studies the value of d d was varied by adjusting the water depth while the diameter was kept constant resulting into flows with different reynolds numbers r e ρ d g d μ based on the water depth however in design problems the water depth is given and the optimum pile diameter is sought therefore in order to clearly examine the effect of d d all simulations in the present study were set in a systematic way by i investigating d d in a wider range 0 2175 0 6525 and ii maintaining the same value of the r e number even though the viscous effects are not considered to be the primary ones for the specific r e number a specific value of the porosity can be achieved either by using many piles of small diameter or fewer piles of larger diameter varying in this way the texture of the pile arrangement in the rest of the manuscript for simplicity the short term texture will be used therefore for a constant porosity case the arrangement with many smaller piles will be referred as the fine texture one and the case with less larger piles as the coarse texture one the sketch in fig 2 demonstrates the difference between the two cases to avoid confusion it is noted that the term texture is not related to the roughness of the surface of the piles which is considered to be smooth in the present study the primary objective of this work was to study the effect of texture of a single row pile breakwater on wave processes induced by the passage of solitary waves and reveal their correlation to the complex free surface motion and the associated nonlinear flow behavior in the vicinity of the piles the mathematical and numerical background of the nwt used in the present study is briefly introduced in section 2 followed by descriptions of the computational setup and the geometrical parameters section 3 includes the results of the grid independence study and the validation of the nwt against the experimental data provided in jiang et al 2015 the parameters examined through numerical simulations and the corresponding results including the texture effect on k t and k r as well as on the wave run up profile around the piles are presented in section 4 subsequently the evolution of the free surface the energy loss and the vorticity generation for all cases are presented and discussed in terms of their correlation to the wave parameters in the same section conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 mathematical numerical model 2 1 governing equations the 3d nwt developed in frantzis et al 2020 which is used in the present study is based on the filtered ns equations the mass continuity equation along with the conservation of momentum describe the incompressible and viscous turbulent motion of two immiscible fluids the non dimensional form of this set of equations in the absence of surface tension effects reads 1 u 0 2 u t u u 1 ρ r e μ r e μ t u u t p ρ a f r where u p ρ and μ are the non dimensional velocity vector pressure density and dynamic viscosity respectively the last term in eq 2 is the non dimensional acceleration vector a g g where g is the gravity vector the reynolds r e and froude f r numbers in eq 2 are defined as 3 r e u o l o ρ o μ o and f r u o 2 l o g where l o and u o denote the characteristic scales used to non dimensionalize length and velocity respectively for all cases presented here these scales were selected to be the still water depth d and g d for length and velocity scales respectively the characteristic scales ρ o and μ o for density and viscosity respectively are chosen to correspond to the heavier fluid i e water as a result the non dimensional numbers that appear in eq 2 become 4 r e d g d ρ w μ w and f r 1 the unresolved motions of the sub grid scales sgs are represented through turbulent eddy viscosity μ t in eq 2 the need to model the unresolved scales of motion is necessary because of the high values of r e numbers that naturally appear in real life wave tanks the value of μ t can be computed using either reynolds averaged ns rans or large eddy simulation les approaches in this study the standard smagorinsky model smagorinsky 1963 is employed within the les approach to define the value of μ t from 5 μ t ρ c s δ 2 s where δ δ x δ y δ z 1 3 is the filter length scale defined by the grid and s 2 s i j s i j 1 2 denotes the modulus of the strain rate deformation tensor the value of the smagorinsky constant c s ranges from 0 065 to 0 23 in the literature meyers and sagaut 2006 depending on the flow problem in the present study the value of c s was set to 0 2 to recover a proper near wall behavior the smagorinsky model is modified in the proximity of solid boundaries using wall damping as described in grigoriadis et al 2003 one serious challenge in nwts is the tracking of the interface that separates the two immiscible fluids the exact location of this interface is required to define the density and viscosity fields in the present study the evolution of the free surface is captured using the conservative level set ls method osher and sethian 1988 sussman et al 1998 this method is based on a scalar field ϕ which describes the minimum signed distance form the interface it is used to define the density and viscosity according to 6 ρ ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ 1 h ϕ 7 μ μ 1 μ 2 μ 1 h ϕ where the subscripts refer to each fluid i e water or air the smoothed heaviside function h ϕ osher and fedkiw 2006 introduces an artificial thickness of the interface to eliminate numerical instabilities because of the discontinuous nature of density and viscosity fields the half thickness of this interface is usually selected equal to 1 5 2 times the grid spacing in cases of rapidly deforming interfaces large density ratios or high r e numbers a half thickness of 8 times the grid spacing could be required according to iafrati and campana 2005 in the present study the half thickness was set to 6 times the minimum grid distance 2 2 discretization and numerical implementation the presented physical model consists of equations which are discretized and solved on a non uniform cartesian grid with a staggered variable arrangement the velocity components u v w are defined at the cell faces while the remaining scalar variables p ρ μ ϕ are defined at the geometric center of each cell within the employed nwt the temporal advancement of the velocity and pressure fields is performed combining the fractional step method chorin 1968 with the pressure splitting scheme presented in frantzis and grigoriadis 2019 the spatial discretization of the convective terms in eq 2 employs the 3 rd order quick scheme the imposition of boundary conditions on solid obstacles in the computational domain is performed using the immersed boundary ib method peskin 1972 following a direct forcing approach for velocities balaras 2004 and the modifications proposed in frantzis and grigoriadis 2019 for the simulation of high r e number flow cases in nwts the c f l courant friedrichs levy becomes the dominant stability criterion regarding time step restrictions for the nwt used in this study a c f l m a x 0 025 is sufficient to guarantee numerical stability frantzis et al 2020 for a detailed description of the ib forcing the interfacial tracking using the ls method and the computational efficiency of the solver the reader is referred to frantzis et al 2020 frantzis and grigoriadis 2019 2 3 wave generation and absorption the schematic diagram of the computational domain is shown in fig 3 the entry region marked as a dotted box in fig 3 corresponds to the wave generation zone in this region of the nwt waves are generated using the relaxation method introduced by mayer et al 1998 provided that the length of this region l g is sufficient the method can also concurrently absorb reflected waves traveling towards this region different waves with pre described characteristics can be generated using analytical solutions the reader is referred to frantzis et al 2020 for a detailed description of the numerical procedure followed for the wave generation for the simulations performed here a solitary wave of height h i is produced using the 3 rd order analytical solution of grimshaw 1970 with a dimensionless wave celerity 8 c s o l i t a r y 1 1 2 h i d 3 20 h i d 2 3 56 h i d 3 following the wave generation zone the nwt comprises the working section of length l w at the end of this working section it is a common practice to add a sufficiently long absorption zone before the end of the domain to minimize reflections in the present study instead of introducing such a zone a convective outlet boundary condition bc was employed at the open end of the domain this reads 9 u t u c u 0 where u c is the convective velocity for the cases examined in the present study this approach was proven to be more effective than including an absorption zone after a series of preliminary tests it was concluded that for a solitary wave reflections were sufficiently absorbed by setting the convective velocity u c equal to the wave s celerity c s o l i t a r y of eq 8 the effectiveness of this approach for solitary waves is demonstrated in the validation and the results sections 3 and 4 a detailed investigation of the performance of this approach for waves other than solitary ones falls outside the scope of the present study 2 4 computational setup and definitions the computational domain used for the simulations performed in the present study is shown in fig 3 where the top sub figure shows the side view x y and the bottom one shows the top view x z of the setup h i is the height of the incident solitary wave and η x t is the free surface elevation at a specific location and time the computational domain width is denoted by l z and the total height of the wave flume is l y apart from setting values for d and s or e and ϵ which were defined in the introduction section the distance of the center of the pile breakwater from the beginning of the working section x p is also required to complete the description of the geometrical configuration used in the numerical simulations the bcs along the bottom and the top boundaries of the nwt were set to no slip and open respectively frantzis et al 2020 the latter ones correspond to homogeneous neumann conditions for all velocity components and constant dirichlet condition for pressure along the spanwise transverse direction periodic bcs were imposed to simulate the geometric repeatability of the breakwater texture as shown in fig 3 for the evaluation of the hydrodynamic behavior of a pile breakwater under the impact of a solitary wave the wave reflection and transmission coefficients were computed by measuring the corresponding wave heights the transmission and the reflection coefficients are defined as 10 k t h t h i 11 k r h r h i where h t is the transmitted wave height recorded in the leeward side by sensors w g 3 or w g 4 in fig 3 and h r is the reflected wave height recorded in the seaward side by sensors w g 1 or w g 2 the maximum run up on the pile is defined in a similar way by 12 k r u h r u h i where h r u is the maximum free surface elevation recorded by the elevation sensor w g 5 fig 3 another quantity of interest is the energy loss by the wave breakwater interaction the dimensionless total energy sum of potential and kinetic energy per unit crest width of a solitary wave is approximately given by sorensen 2006 13 e s o l i t 8 3 9 d 3 h d 3 2 using the conservation of energy the energy loss due to the interaction can be computed as e d e i e t e r where the subscripts i t and r refer to the incident transmitted and reflected wave respectively the corresponding energy loss coefficient k d is defined as 14 k d e d e i 1 k t 3 2 k r 3 2 it is noted that the energy in the transmitted and reflected waves is not accurately represented by eq 13 because their form includes additional secondary peaks in contrast to the intact solitary wave form therefore the energy loss coefficient k d of eq 14 which was also used in other studies liu et al 2011 is a rough estimation of the energy loss in the present study the exact amount of the energy loss was also calculated using a more rigorous definition approach as described and discussed in section 4 3 the results presented in the next sections sections 3 and 4 are in a non dimensional form for instance η u v and t are the non dimensional values of the free surface elevation streamwise velocity component spanwise velocity component and time respectively given by η η d u u g d v v g d and t t d g where η u v and t are the corresponding dimensional values of each quantity 3 validation the nwt used in the present study has been already validated for several test cases in frantzis et al 2020 in this section this nwt is further validated ensuring that it is an appropriate tool to study problems where a large solitary wave interacts with pile breakwaters for this configuration a limited number of experimental and numerical studies are available in the literature the case examined in jiang et al 2015 was selected because the incident wave height h i d 0 35 is within the nonlinear regime h i d 0 25 this study includes both experimental measurements and numerical results obtained by the waves2foam module of the widely used cfd software openfoam jacobsen 2017 jacobsen et al 2012 in the experimental setup the free surface elevation was recorded at two locations seawards w g 1 2 and two locations leewards w g 3 4 of the piles as indicated in fig 3 the streamwise and vertical components of the velocity in the water were measured at the seaward a d v 1 and the leeward a d v 2 side of the gap between piles as shown in fig 3 the locations of all the sensors with respect to the center of the middle pile are summarized in table 1 the set of parameters that correspond to the configuration of jiang et al 2015 are 15 r e ρ w d g d μ w 279152 h i 0 35 d d 0 25 d and s 0 4 d which correspond to a gap width of e 0 15 d and a porosity of ϵ 37 5 for the pile breakwater the incident wave height h i was obtained as the peak elevation recorded by the wave gauge w g 1 the experimental breakwater consisted of ten cylindrical piles confined in the transverse spanwise direction by the side walls of the wave tank to reduce the computational cost of the numerical simulations jiang et al 2015 truncated the computational domain to comprise five cylinders applying symmetric bcs along the transverse spanwise direction they reported that the run up profiles did not deviate significantly between the five cylinders justifying the use of a narrower domain in the present study a computational domain with a total length of l x 55 d and a height l y 2 d was used the wave maker zone extended from the beginning of the domain to 5 d in the streamwise direction and the relaxation zone extended for another 10 d comprising a wave generation relaxation zone of total length l r 15 d the center of the pile was located at a distance of x p 25 d from the end of the relaxation zone as indicated in fig 3 the effect of the size of the computational domain along the spanwise direction l z is presented in detail in section 3 1 the numerical grids used for the validation are presented in table 2 for all grids a constant grid spacing δ y and δ z was used along the vertical and the spanwise directions along the streamwise direction a uniform grid spacing of δ x m i n was used in the region 2 5 d 10 d with respect to the center of the circular piles before and after this region the grid was stretched with a linear factor of 1 03 the maximum grid spacing was restricted to δ x 4 δ x m i n the resulting grids consisted approximately from 1 2 up to 51 1 million cells the numerical grids m 1 and m 2 were used to assess the sensitivity of the results on the computational domain width l z which is discussed in section 3 1 the last three grids m 3 m 5 were used for the grid sensitivity analysis presented in section 3 2 3 1 effect of domain width in this section the effect of the domain width l z is examined by comparing the elevation and velocity signals using grids m 1 and m 2 the only difference between those two grids is the domain width which contains either one l z s or three cylindrical piles l z 3 s fig 4 presents the comparison of the two grids for the free surface elevation and velocity all signals were shifted in time in order to align t 0 with the maximum peak recorded by w g 1 for the predicted elevation signals it is hard to observe any differences between the two different domains for any of the two wave gauges located in the seaward fig 4a or the leeward fig 4b side the deviation on the computed transmitted and reflected crest elevations was about 0 1 between the two domains the same also applies for the streamwise u and vertical v components of the velocity even after the pile wave interaction i e the passage of the transmitted wave crest from the vicinity of the breakwater as shown in fig 4c after this event small differences were recorded at the leeward side by a d v 2 fig 4d when the transmitted wave crest had already traveled a distance of 3 d 12 d away from the breakwater according to these results a single pile simulation combined with periodic bcs is considered sufficient to provide accurate results for the wave breakwater interaction therefore for the simulations to follow a computational domain with a single pile l z s was considered for all cases in these simulations the periodicity was imposed at the central axes of two adjacent gaps similar to the schematic diagram of fig 3 3 2 grid sensitivity after justifying that simulations with a single pile provide proper results a grid independence study is presented in this section this was carried out to identify the minimum number of cells n g a p required to resolve the gap width e between two adjacent cylinders three different numerical grids were used for this purpose namely grids m 3 m 4 and m 5 as indicated in table 2 fig 5 shows the comparison of these three grids for the temporal variation of the free surface elevation in the seaward w g 1 2 and the leeward w g 3 4 side against the experimental measurements and the cfd results of jiang et al 2015 similar to the previous section t 0 refers to the time instant of maximum peak recording of w g 1 moreover due to the dissipation of energy during wave propagation the incident wave height h i recorded by the wave gauge w g 1 is slightly decreased compared to the generated wave height therefore in order to compare the three simulations in a consistent way the elevation signals η t were scaled with the corresponding peak value measured by w g 1 all numerical results were found in very good agreement between each other and in satisfactory agreement with the experimental measurements the largest difference with respect to the experimental measurements was the over prediction of the reflection coefficient k r second peak in the seaward side sensors w g 1 2 when the coarser grid m 5 was used k r was overpredicted approximately by 50 with respect to the experimental measurements and about 25 with respect to the other numerical results for the transmission coefficient k t first peak in the leeward side sensors w g 3 4 even with the coarser resolution m 5 the experimental value is underpredicted only by about 6 as shown in fig 5 increasing the resolution by using grids m 3 and m 4 an almost excellent agreement was achieved between the present model and the numerical results in jiang et al 2015 for the free surface elevation and the predicted coefficients k t and k r for the latter the resulting values of k t 0 865 and k r 0 155 deviate less than 1 and 5 respectively from the corresponding values in jiang et al 2015 the largest discrepancy between the present results and the numerical predictions using waves2foam jiang et al 2015 occurred at the tail of the transmitted solitary wave w g 3 and w g 4 this can be clearly observed at time instants around 32 for w g 3 and 27 for w g 4 this divergence originates from different wave absorption treatments adopted by the models in jiang et al 2015 a relatively short in terms of a solitary wave that has infinite wavelength absorption zone of 1 m i e 5 d was used leading to insufficient absorption of the transmitted wave and generating weak but not negligible wave reflection on the other hand in the current study a convective outlet bc for the velocity was employed section 2 3 which proved to be more appropriate for a solitary wave the absence of an absorption zone also leads to a shorter computational domain regarding the velocity signals at the seaward side locations both velocity components u and v are accurately captured by all grid resolutions as shown in figs 6a and 6b at these locations a converged solution was reached even with the coarser grid m 5 however this is not the case at the leeward side of the breakwater where the coarser grid was found to generate strong velocity oscillations after the passage of the wave crest these oscillations in the leeward side are attributed to the modeling of the sgs motions which are taken into account by the turbulence model in this region intense vortical motions in the wake disturb the flow locally amplifying the importance of the unresolved sgs of motion this explains why those oscillations are gradually diminished for the finer grids m 3 and m 4 it also explains the differences observed with respect to the numerical results in jiang et al 2015 where the les approach was also used with a different model for the contribution of the sgs scales namely an one equation model overall the free surface elevation and the coefficients k t and k r were found to be grid insensitive and to converge faster than the velocity components the velocity components would require an even finer numerical resolution to achieve grid convergence especially in the wake region after the passage of the transmitted wave crest since free surface elevation is the primary quantity of interest a grid resolution with 10 cells in the gap corresponding to slightly finer resolution than m 4 was considered as sufficient for the simulations performed in the next section 4 numerical results as mentioned in the introduction the main objective of the present study was to examine the effect of texture on the hydrodynamic behavior of the breakwater in a consistent and systematic way for a certain porosity value the geometrical parameter that defines texture is the ratio d d or s d in previous studies found in the literature this parameter has been investigated in the range d d 0 15 0 20 liu et al 2011 huang and yuan 2010 jiang et al 2015 by changing the water depth d in the present study the same water depth was maintained in all simulations so that the r e number was kept constant and equal to 50 1 0 3 a total of twelve cases were simulated as shown in table 3 corresponding to four different geometrical configurations and three different values of the incident wave height h i d 0 200 0 275 and 0 350 cases 4 9 were used to examine texture effects for a wide range of the parameter d d 0 2175 0 6525 using a porosity value of ϵ 27 5 for completeness cases 1 3 and 10 12 were also simulated to examine the effects of porosity on the deformation of the free surface the energy loss and the generated vorticity patterns compared to the validation case presented in section 3 lower values of the porosity were examined in this section this choice is justified by the objective to examine breakwaters that can achieve lower values of the transmission coefficient compared to the validation case jiang et al 2015 presented in the previous section in terms of computational cost the cases presented here are more challenging because reduced values of porosity are associated with increased resolution requirements and higher velocities in the gap region following the analysis of section 3 1 a single cylinder with periodic bcs along the spanwise direction was considered for all cases therefore the width of the computational domain was always equal to l z s the length and height of the computational domain were set in all cases equal to l x 35 d and l y 2 2 d respectively according to the schematic diagram of fig 3 in all cases the center of the pile was placed at a distance of x p 25 d and the length of the wave generation zone was set equal to l g 15 d in order to minimize grid resolution effects among different cases all simulations were performed using the same grid spacing the grid resolution was decided according to the grid sensitivity analysis performed in section 3 2 along the spanwise direction a fixed grid spacing δ z d 160 was set according to the worst case scenario of the lowest porosity cases 1 3 so that at least ten grid cells were used to resolve the gap between the piles n g a p 10 in table 3 the grid spacing was also uniform along the vertical direction equal to δ y d 100 for all cases along the streamwise direction a minimum grid spacing of δ x m i n d 160 was used in the region 2 d to 3 2 d with respect to the center of the pile before and after this region the grid was expanded with a linear stretching factor of 1 03 until δ x 4 δ x m i n using these spacing distances a grid consisting of 2111 220 48 cells was used for the cases with s d 0 3 and a grid of 2111 220 144 cells for the cases with s d 0 9 the hydrodynamic behavior of the pile breakwater in terms of the coefficients of transmission k t reflection k r energy loss k d and maximum run up k r u is presented and discussed in section 4 1 the free surface profiles around the pile at the moment of maximum run up are shown in section 4 2 sections 4 3 4 5 focus on the wave breakwater interaction by analyzing the wave energy loss the 3d evolution of the free surface and the evolution of the vorticity fields in the water respectively 4 1 hydrodynamic behavior of the breakwater the hydrodynamic behavior of the pile breakwater in terms of k t and k r was examined by measuring the free surface elevation before and after the breakwater the two wave gauges w g 1 and w g 4 in fig 3 were intentionally placed sufficiently far from the breakwater so that a 2d profile of the free surface elevation was recovered with negligible deviations along the spanwise direction in the worst case scenario where d 0 6525 d these locations are about 11 5 d away from the center of the cylinder moreover an additional wave gauge w g 5 was placed just before the cylinder to record the run up at the seaward side the locations of these three sensors are shown in table 4 due to small deviations from the targeted and the generated waves the first peak measured by w g 1 was defined as the incident wave height and was also used to normalize all the relevant signals making the different cases comparable as an example fig 7 shows the normalized free surface elevation recorded by w g 1 w g 4 and w g 5 for the coarse texture cases with ϵ 27 5 figs 7a and 7b depict how the reflected and transmitted waves were measured for each case respectively in addition fig 7c shows the free surface elevation exactly before the pile w g 5 seaward side which indicates the maximum run up on the pile the coefficients k t k r k d and k r u for all the cases with fine texture s 0 3 d are shown in fig 8 as a function of porosity for different wave heights the results presented in fig 8 are consistent with previously reported results the effect of porosity on k t and k r figs 8a and 8b is as expected with the coefficients following an opposite trend as the porosity increases as far as the energy loss coefficient k d is concerned fig 8c it was found to be reducing with higher porosity in agreement with results reported for regular waves isaacson et al 1998 regarding the maximum dimensionless run up k r u this was also found to be reducing with higher porosity values as it was also observed in yao et al 2017 where a solitary wave was interacting with a double row pile breakwater of circular cross sections as far as the effect of the incident wave height nonlinearity is concerned k t follows a decreasing trend while k r shows an increasing albeit weaker trend with increasing h i d k r u and k d also show an increasing trend with increasing h i d this observation is consistent with the reported effect of h i on k d for similar configurations under regular huang 2007b or solitary liu et al 2011 waves therefore one may conclude that k r k r u and k d follow the same behavior in terms of pile porosity and incident wave height variations with k r mostly depending on porosity while k t following the opposite trend as already mentioned the effect of texture was not adequately examined in the past only two studies liu et al 2011 huang and yuan 2010 examined this parameter by reducing the depth in their experiments varying the texture parameter d d but in a quite narrow range of 0 15 0 20 inevitably leading to negligible differences in the present study the effect of the texture was examined in a systematic way for the medium value of the porosity ϵ 27 5 and a texture parameter d d that ranged between 0 2175 0 6525 the comparative results between the two textures are presented in fig 9 for a specific value of porosity ϵ a finer texture corresponds to a breakwater consisting of more piles with a smaller diameter d d such a regime corresponds to the fine texture cases 7 9 of table 3 where three times thinner cylinders occupy the same width in comparison to the coarse texture cases 4 6 for the same value of porosity ϵ 27 5 as shown in fig 9 the fine texture was found to increase k d by 20 when h i is close to the linear regime while this increase reached about 30 for h i 0 35 d this behavior was anticipated because a breakwater with a finer texture contains more gaps that generate more vortices interacting with each other at closer distances to each other amplifying the energy loss under these conditions a reduction in the k t is also expected for finer texture cases as demonstrated in fig 9 this was indeed the case with an almost constant reduction of about 2 5 for all values of h i d examined although k t and k r usually have an adverse behavior a reduction of k r was also noticed with the fine texture especially for larger values of h i d up to 6 for h i 0 35 d moreover due to the leeward side vortices k t would be expected to be more sensitive to texture than k r interestingly enough this was not the case in the nonlinear regime i e at higher values of h i d as far as the texture effect on k r u is concerned no significant variation was observed in the linear regime on the other hand an increased value of about 5 5 was observed for the larger wave height of h i 0 35 d as it will be shown later this behavior is attributed to nonlinear effects such as free surface breaking which are amplified for larger incoming wave heights in addition k r u shows an adverse behavior to that of k r this was an unexpected result because k r u and k r have a similar trend as a function of other parameters such as ϵ and h i d it is also interesting to mention that k r u and k d follow always the same trend with changing any parameter showing that the increase of energy loss is always resulting to larger values of run up 4 2 run up profiles in this section the free surface elevation profile around the pile is presented at the moment of maximum run up k r u this time instant was identified for each case using the temporal evolution of the free surface elevation at the sensor w g 5 as shown in fig 7c the recorded elevation of the free surface profile around the perimeter of the pile is shown in fig 10 the leeward and seaward points are identified as 0 and 180 respectively for the fine texture cases figs 10a and 10b the variation of run up along the perimeter r u θ η θ h i are similar mainly characterized by three regions in the first region the run up around the pile remains almost constant from the front point 180 to the side point 90 of the pile perimeter in the second region the elevation drops to its minimum value at about 30 finally in the third region the run up slightly increases towards the leeward point 0 with an almost constant value around it for the coarse texture case black line in fig 10c the elevation drops faster from the front point 180 of the pile perimeter to the side point 90 until reaching its minimum value at about 30 45 the exact location of the point depends on h i after that point the run up increases towards the leeward point 0 where a local maximum is formed for increasing porosity ϵ fig 10a the run up on the cylinder decreases at the seaward point 180 and increases at the leeward point 0 an opposite trend was found for the effect of the wave height h i fig 10b for increasing wave height the run up at the seaward and leeward points was found to increase and decrease respectively the minimum run up value was found to behave similarly with the run up at the leeward point 0 for both ϵ and h i regarding the texture this was found to affect the run up in a different manner compared to ϵ and h i for example as shown in fig 10c the maximum run up at 180 was not significantly affected by texture texture effects were mainly identified along the leeward side of the pile in the coarse texture case black line in fig 10c from case p 2 n 1 h 3 in table 3 the run up was significantly increased at the leeward side 0 the minimum run up at about 45 followed an adverse behavior reducing its value and moving towards the seaward side at this location the first derivative of r u θ r u θ θ rapidly changed sign indicating an almost vertical free surface profile which is close to its breaking 4 3 energy loss in this section the temporal evolution of the wave energy loss is calculated in a rigorous manner by taking into account the total volume of water and its velocity field the total mechanical energy of the wave e t o t is defined as the sum of the potential e p and the kinetic e k energy in the absence of surface tension forces these terms are calculated by the volume integrals 16 e p t 1 f r w t y d v and e k t 1 2 w t u t 2 d v where w t is the water volume of the working section of the nwt the region of the artificial thickness of the interface where the density changes is excluded from the integration to avoid spurious velocity components iafrati 2011 iafrati et al 2014 sensible conclusions on the evolution of the wave energy can only be drawn by examining the time interval for which almost all the wave energy is contained within the working section this time interval depends on the wave celerity which depends on the wave height to define an appropriate time interval simulations for an undisturbed solitary wave were performed fig 11 shows the temporal evolution of the total energy e t o t per crest width l z for different wave heights before and after the passage of the solitary wave from the working section t t 1 and t t 4 respectively for h i 0 2 d the total energy corresponds to the potential energy of the still water column e t o t t 0 e p t 0 which is termed as the background energy e b g the useful time interval for each case corresponds to the region where the total energy reaches a plateau e g t 2 t 3 for h i 0 2 d the difference between the maximum value of the graph and the e b g defines the energy content of the incident wave e w a v e h i as indicated in fig 11 for higher values of h i the energy content of the wave is increased moving also t 2 and t 3 at earlier time instants the moment t h i when the wave crest was located at the location of w g 1 is indicated with black solid circles in fig 11 according to fig 7a t h i 20 65 20 00 and 19 50 for h i 0 200 d 0 275 d and 0 350 d respectively in order to focus on the useful part of this graph the time interval where e t o t of the free wave was almost constant was isolated thus a specific time interval of t 2 t 3 was chosen according to the incident wave height h i of each case following fig 11 the dimensionless time intervals for the cases with h i 0 2 d 0 275 d and 0 35 d were chosen to be 26 0 31 0 24 5 30 5 and 23 5 29 5 respectively moreover in order to make the results of all cases comparable the energy difference with respect to the maximum content in each case was calculated as a percentage of the corresponding e w a v e h i simulated i e 17 δ e w a v e t e t o t t e t o t t 2 e w a v e h i therefore the corresponding energy loss in each case is given by δ e w a v e the most important mechanisms that are responsible for the increased loss of the solitary wave energy excluding the flow friction on the pile surface are koraim 2014 i the contraction and acceleration of the flow in order to pass through the slots small gaps ii the formation of vortices in the leeward side of the structure iii the generation and the enhancement of turbulence due to flow separation and iv the violent free surface motion and the occurrence of wave free surface breaking the temporal evolution of δ e w a v e of each case simulated is shown in fig 12 isolating the time interval of interest i e t 2 t 3 it is noted that the loss of the wave energy is displayed without distinguishing the effect of the different mechanisms the results presented in fig 12 support the more generic results presented in figs 8 and 9 that refer to the energy loss coefficient k d of the pile breakwater which is only based on the transmitted and reflected wave heights it is again observed that the energy loss amplifies for lower ϵ higher h i d and finer texture 4 4 free surface deformation in this section it is attempted to explain the energy loss behavior presented in the previous section by analyzing the free surface deformation detailed 3d profiles of the free surface motion during the overturning and breaking processes are presented and discussed in terms of varying wave height porosity and texture the relevant snapshots are accompanied with the corresponding energy loss curves in the water as calculated in the previous section it has to be noted that very fine free surface deformations such as droplets and bubbles which are smaller than the spatial numerical resolution are not captured according to deane and stokes 2002 bubbles larger than the hinze scale 1 mm are subjected to fragmentation while smaller bubbles tend to be stable because of surface tension forces based on the parameters used in the present study the minimum grid size corresponds to 0 635 mm even though this is almost half the value of the minimum bubble size such details cannot be resolved due to the smoothing of the properties around the interface and the absence of surface tension effects to capture the smallest bubbles with pure air in their core at least five times smaller grid cells would be required even with the use of the efficient nwt adopted in the present study the total computational cost for such a simulation would be prohibitive before proceeding to the comparisons between cases case p 2 n 1 h 2 will be presented in detail to demonstrate a typical interaction of the incoming wave with the breakwater fig 13 shows snapshots of the free surface profile at nine characteristic time instants along with the corresponding wave energy loss graph according to the results in fig 13 the free surface first rises at both seaward and leeward side of the pile when the incident wave crest reaches the vicinity of the pile in the seaward side of the pile the free surface rises faster resulting a much higher peak elevation compared to the leeward side of the pile t 24 50 26 75 figs 13a 13d at the same time during t 25 25 26 75 figs 13b 13d the free surface in the leeward side starts a backward overturning process and its front becomes almost vertical slightly before the occurrence of the maximum run up k r u at t 26 5 this process is responsible for air entrapment due to free surface breaking and the formation of an air pocket which occurs just after the cylindrical pile and extends in the spanwise direction for a length that is about two times the gap distance e water passes through the gap with high streamwise velocities drifting air into the air pocket for as long as the pocket is open and connected with the free surface the air pocket closes and completely detaches from the free surface during its downward motion at the seaward side of the pile t 28 25 fig 13f afterwards the air pocket is transported in the streamwise direction penetrating deeper while rotating counter clockwise with respect to the spanwise axis t 29 fig 13g following the formation of this air pocket a secondary air pocket which is elongated in the streamwise direction is developed due to the high streamwise velocities that still exist in the gap however the secondary air pocket lasts for a considerably shorter period of time compared to the main one since it experiences very quick fragmentation this secondary air pocket is formed in the gap region t 28 25 29 75 figs 13f 13h while the wave crest travels away from the vicinity of the pile the velocities constantly decrease as a result the transport of the first air pocket terminates and starts moving backwards and upwards t 29 75 fig 13h due to buoyancy the reverse motion of the first air pocket is responsible for its disintegration which leads to air pocket remnants that slowly move upwards allowing the air to escape t 30 5 fig 13i it is noted that the air pockets and bubbles which become smaller than the grid size are removed from the simulation nevertheless this has no effect on the predicted hydrodynamic behavior of the breakwater since the primary wave breaking is accurately captured and the remaining flow energy in the vicinity of the pile will eventually be dissipated comparing the free surface profile at the location of the two gaps where the periodic bc is applied it is observed that symmetry is maintained up to the time instant before the formation of the main air pocket after that time instant symmetry is lost and as consequence the periodic bc might affect the results by suppressing flow and free surface structures however this numerical treatment might affect only the smaller less important structures that are driven by turbulence and does not affect the main structures that are generated by the geometrical configuration moreover the transmitted and reflected crests that contain most of the wave s energy have traveled away from the area where the periodicity affects the results this also explains the almost identical results found in section 3 1 in summary the main stages experienced by the free surface deformation when a solitary wave interacts with a pile breakwater are 1 undisturbed wave form 2 run up on the pile 3 backward overturning of the free surface at the leeward side 4 generation of a backwards oriented free surface bulge located off center of the pile 5 formation of an air pocket which is elongated in the spanwise direction 6 transport of the air pocket leewards and downwards while rotating around the spanwise axis 7 formation of a secondary air pocket closer to the pile 8 transmitted and reflected crests are separated 9 upward and backward motion of the air pockets that are subsequently disintegrated and form a cloud of bubbles 10 entrapped air escapes 11 oscillatory free surface motion until the remaining energy in the vicinity of the pile is dissipated as far as the dissipation rate is concerned high values were identified during the overturning motion of the free surface and before the first air pocket was fully closed t 26 27 5 dissipation becomes almost zero after the fragmentation of the air pockets stage 9 the effect of the breakwater porosity on the free surface deformation is shown in fig 14 for the higher value of h i d 0 350 and the fine texture it is observed that the air pockets generated in all cases penetrate approximately to the same depth regarding both the first t 25 75 figs 14a 14d 14g or the second t 27 50 figs 14b 14e 14h air entrapment events the slightly increased energy loss observed in smaller porosity values could be a result of two factors first the reduced gap leads to increased velocities that allow the formation of more energetic bubbles these bubbles are transported faster to reach the location of the transmitted crest t 28 25 fig 14i in combination with the reduced transmission which results in a lower and slower transmitted wave a more energetic bubble interacts and dissipates energy in the high energy density area of the crest region iafrati 2011 the enhanced energy loss observed at lower porosity values is also partially attributed to the amplified shear forces in the gap region and to the higher velocities that are developed due to the intensive contraction of the flow next the effect of the breakwater texture at different values of the incident wave height is analyzed starting with the smallest wave height examined h i d 0 200 which is closer to the linear regime fig 15 shows the free surface profile at three characteristic time instants for both the fine figs 15a 15c and the coarse figs 15d 15f texture cases it is observed that the first air entrapment occurs at about the same time t 28 50 figs 15b and 15e in both cases the air pocket formed in the coarse texture case penetrates deeper compared to the one in the fine texture case as clearly indicated by figs 15c and 15f it is also observed that an earlier free surface breaking event is initiated in the fine texture case t 27 50 fig 15a but it does not result in the formation of an air pocket the free surface became almost vertical but the flow passing through the gap is not fast enough to accelerate air below the bulge and fold the free surface to form an air pocket as far as the texture effect in the highly nonlinear regime h i d 0 350 is concerned both coarse and fine texture cases experience an intense air entrapment event at about t 27 5 as shown in figs 16b and 16e in the fine texture case though an earlier air entrapment is induced forming a smaller air pocket this is clearly indicated at t 26 0 in fig 16 where the air pocket of the coarse texture case fig 16d is not fully closed while in the fine texture case fig 16a the first air entrapment event was completed and the second one is in progress moreover it is observed that the air pockets developed in the coarse texture case penetrate deeper compared to the ones developed in the fine texture case summarizing the observations for the texture effect at both small and large wave heights one would expect an increased energy loss for the coarse texture case due to the deeper penetration of the air pockets as observed by chanson and jaw fang 1997 however in the fine texture case a higher energy dissipation rate develops for the cases examined here in the highly nonlinear regime of h i d 0 350 the energy dissipated in the fine texture case was approximately twice the energy dissipated in the coarse texture this is attributed to the fact that an additional earlier air entrapment event occurs in the fine texture as a result in the fine texture case an air entrapment event occurs closer to the wave crest where higher energy density exists enhancing dissipation moreover the first breaking event of the fine texture case takes place before the instant of maximum k r u initiating the energy dissipation process before the completion of the wave reflection thus increasing the dissipation of the reflected wave for the coarse texture case the air entrapment process starts after the occurrence of the maximum k r u allowing the reflected crest to avoid the dissipation process this could also be the explanation for the stronger texture effect on the reflection coefficient k r compared to the one on the transmission coefficient k t as shown in fig 9 distinct differences on the free surface deformation also appear when the incident wave height increases air entrapment events were present even for the smaller wave height examined in this study however their size and intensity amplify when the wave height increases for example in the coarse texture case examined the size and the spanwise extend of the main i e larger air pocket increase for larger incident wave height according to figs 15f and 16f the air entrapment takes place in a very short spanwise length when h i d 0 200 while in the case of h i d 0 350 the air pocket covers almost all the domain width regarding the fine texture case the generation of an additional air pocket was observed at earlier time instants when the incident wave height increases as indicated by comparing figs 15a and 16a this earlier air entrapment event was initiated in the low wave height as well since the free surface became almost vertical but it was not completed to form an air pocket 4 5 vorticity generation as demonstrated in the previous section the nonlinear interaction of solitary waves with the pile breakwater leads to a complex evolution of the free surface which folds backwards against the wave direction resulting to crest breaking and air entrapment events in the leeward side these mechanisms generate spanwise vortices that are responsible for the vorticity transport in deeper locations and the enhancement of the wave energy dissipation moreover vertical vortices are generated due to flow separation on the piles in order to exploit further the wave structure interaction and the mechanisms of energy dissipation the behavior of the spanwise and vertical vorticity components is analyzed and discussed in a qualitative manner 4 5 1 spanwise vorticity the generation and evolution of the spanwise vorticity ω z is presented considering two characteristic x y planes the middle plane intersecting the center of the cylinder and the gap plane intersecting the center of the gap the porosity effect on the generation and evolution of the ω z is displayed in fig 17 for the larger wave height h i d 0 350 although the transmitted energy and mass are much lower with lower porosities higher velocities are observed due to the stronger acceleration and contraction of the flow through the gap as a result the leeward side wake vortices are transported further downstream as porosity increases leading to lower levels of vorticity in the region immediate leewards of the pile this is clearly indicated in the middle plane of both cases in fig 17b at t 29 in addition due to the increased velocity in the low porosity case both bottom and free surface generated vortices in the gap plane are pushed faster upwards and downwards respectively as a consequence these two vortices meet approximately at mid depth earlier t 27 in fig 17b the texture effect is firstly examined for the case of the large wave height h i d 0 350 where the differences are more distinguishable fig 18 presents characteristic time instants starting from the moment of maximum run up which occurs at t 26 for both coarse and fine texture cases according to these results it is evident that the vorticity of the fine texture develops earlier compared to the coarse one as indicated at t 27 this happens due to the occurrence of the first air entrapment event in the fine texture case before the free surface reaches its maximum run up it is shown at t 26 in fig 18a that the air pocket in the fine texture case was already formed before the time of maximum run up on the other hand the first air entrapment event in the coarse texture case occurs long after that instant at about t 27 in fig 18b by that time the initially developed vorticity in the fine texture case is convected and diffused further downstream downwards and in the transverse direction at the same time the second air entrapment event which is the stronger one is in progress since the wave celerity of the transmitted wave is almost the same for the two textures the transmitted wave crest is at the same position for identical time instants as shown in fig 18 thus in the fine texture case both air entrapment and increased vorticity are generated and interact closer to the transmitted crest enhancing the dissipation rate differences also arise on the vorticity that originates from the bed boundary layer regarding the fine texture case a growing vorticity region is developing along the bed in the gap plane at t 26 fig 18a at t 27 this vorticity region grows in the streamwise direction and penetrates to the middle plane on the other hand the bed vorticity in the coarse texture case shown in fig 18b is weaker taking also into account the larger distance between the gap and middle planes in the coarse texture case it takes longer for the vorticity that is generated at the gap plane to reach the middle plane compared to the fine texture case after the passage of the wave the remaining vortices in the vicinity of the pile are slowly spread in all directions attenuating due to diffusion and vortical interaction for both textures shown in fig 18 the generated vorticity has reached the same streamwise distance of about 2 d leewards of the pile center before it practically vanishes further downstream in the same manner the texture effect for the low wave height case of h i d 0 200 is given in fig 19 starting at t 28 0 which is slightly after the occurrence of maximum run up t 27 5 the behavior is similar to the one of the large wave height fig 18 albeit with reduced vorticity intensity it is important to mention that vorticity in the gap plane is generated at about the same time in both fine and coarse texture cases when the incident wave height is smaller as indicated at t 30 in figs 19a and 19b as expected due to lower velocities the vortices traveled to a shorter streamwise distance of about 1 5 d with respect to the center of the pile focusing on the last snapshot of each case t 34 in fig 19 and t 31 in fig 18 the earlier development and the homogenization of vorticity in the fine texture is compared to the vorticity behavior in the coarse texture for instance in the fine texture case vorticity covers almost the whole area in the vicinity of the pile while in the coarse texture case the bed and free surface vorticity fields just intersect at approximately mid depth the current observations of faster regularization and homogenization of the leeward side wake vorticity when smaller gaps are used i e fine texture are in agreement with the data reported in molin 2011 summarizing figs 17 18 shown in this section it is manifested that strong spanwise vorticity is generated at the free surface only after an air entrapment event is completed forming a closed air pocket similar observations were noted for regular breaking waves in iafrati 2011 even though the levels of ω z are very low before that instant the dissipation is already active according to fig 12 after the main wave pile interaction and the escape of the entrapped air most of the energy has traveled away along with the transmitted and reflected crests thus the termination of the dissipation process is observed fig 12 even though a weaker dissipation procedure continues due to the attenuation of the remaining vorticity in the vicinity of the pile 4 5 2 vertical vorticity in this section the evolution of the vertical vorticity ω y is presented and discussed for one porosity case ϵ 27 5 the larger value of the solitary wave height h i d 0 350 and both fine and coarse texture contours of ω y are presented in horizontal x z planes located at elevations y 0 015 0 500 0 700 0 900 above the seabed the temporal evolution of the ω y is presented at t 25 27 29 and 31 in figs 20 21 22 and 23 respectively comparing the two texture cases the most evident difference is that the primary vorticity patterns are more elongated for the finer texture case according to fig 20 that refers to t 25 it is confirmed that the development of the vorticity in the fine texture case occurs much earlier than that of the coarse texture one however at t 25 the first air pocket is not completely closed allowing for a well organized anti symmetric vertical vorticity field according to the findings of section 4 5 1 spanwise vorticity was generated at the free surface and the bed and transported towards mid depth distorting the well organized vertical vorticity thus the well organized ω y field breaks sooner at locations near the free surface and the bed compared to the mid depth locations y 0 5 in fig 21 moreover noting that the maximum run up occurs at t 26 in both cases and the location of the crests are almost identical it is concluded that the reflected and transmitted crests in the fine texture case are closer to the region of intense ω y it is reminded that the locations of the fine texture crests are also closer to the region of intense ω z as observed in section 4 5 1 in addition regarding the coarse texture case it is again observed that the region close to the middle of the pile toe and below y 0 5 remains unaffected by the high vorticity levels e g at t 29 and 31 in contrast to the fine texture case to conclude the last time instant fig 23 demonstrates the faster diffusion of the vorticity and the faster homogenization of the flow when smaller gaps fine texture are used molin 2011 also observed in section 4 5 1 5 conclusions the interaction of a solitary wave with a single row pile breakwater of circular cross section was studied by a series of simulations using an efficient nwt that is capable of capturing complex and nonlinear phenomena such as the free surface breaking the developed numerical model was firstly validated showing very good agreement against experimental and numerical data available in the literature the effects of breakwater porosity and pile diameter texture as well as incident wave height on the transmission reflection and energy loss coefficients were presented the run up profile around the pile the evolution of the free surface and the generated vorticity fields were also presented and discussed the present study emphasized on the texture pile diameter effect revealing deviations on the hydrodynamic behavior of the breakwater i e coefficients k t k r k d and k r u the differences between textures were found to amplify for larger values of the incident wave height for h i 0 35 d comparing two textures with pile diameter of d and 3 d and the same porosity the corresponding values of k t k r and k r u present maximum differences of about 5 in the finer texture case k d was found to be larger by about 20 than in the coarse texture one in the linear regime h i 0 2 d this difference increased further in the nonlinear regime reaching about 30 larger values for h i 0 35 d it was also found that both k t and k r decrease when using a finer texture even though one would expect an opposite behavior for k r moreover k t was found to be more insensitive than k r to texture effects which was an unexpected result one would expect the opposite behavior because the flow field in the leeward side where k t is measured changes drastically e g air entrapment and vorticity behavior when the texture changes while the flow field differences found in the seaward side are minimal an additional unforeseen result regarding the texture effect was the opposite behavior between k r u and k r despite the fact that both share the same trend when other parameters porosity or wave height change the above observations and results were explained by analyzing the free surface deformation the wave energy loss and the generated vorticity during the wave structure interaction the pile breakwaters could effectively be used for the protection against tsunami type waves especially in regions where a rubble mound breakwater is not a practical solution even though pile breakwaters cannot totally dissipate the energy of a tsunami wave sufficient reduction on the transmitted wave can be achieved while the water renewal in their leeward side is

21718,noise measurements in a cavitation tunnel are the common procedure widely used by most of the institutes for predicting the underwater radiated noise urn of a boat propeller the accuracy of such a measurement is strongly linked to the acoustic response of the facility the knowledge of this acoustic behaviour is then one of the key point to perform an accurate measurement due to the geometrical shape of a test section the acoustic propagation is similar to propagation in duct this propagation could be described at low frequencies by modal propagation for higher frequencies the total number of propagating modes increases and the acoustics inside the duct becomes statistical schroeder described the limit between these two domains modal statistical in 1954 for closed space applications like room acoustics the formula derived in 1954 was completed and improved few years after to fit with results obtained by experiments and monte carlo simulations following the same effort the principle of this limiting frequency called here and henceforth schroeder frequency is derived to comply with particularities of the acoustic propagation in duct and to the environment of a test section of a cavitation tunnel because it exists cavitation tunnel with rectangular or circular test sections the adaptation of the schroeder equation is performed for both configurations the description of the statistical features of the acoustic field is also derived finally experiments have been carried out in our cavitation tunnel to assess the accuracy of the equation and more particularly the threshold used to delimit the two domains keywords acoustic measurements model scale reverberation transfer function statistical distributions 1 introduction since several decades marine propeller performances have always increased due to environmental requirements and future noise standards designers are nowadays concerned by acoustical stealth not only for military reasons but also for passenger ship comfort and impact of the underwater radiated noise on marine fauna the control of the radiated noise is usually performed at model scale in a dedicated facility mainly hydroacoustic cavitation tunnels depressurized tanks see lafeber et al 2015 or also circulating water channels felli et al 2015 the results obtained are then scaled to the full scale to predict the acoustic power radiated by the ship at sea measuring the acoustic field in an acoustic environment such as a cavitation tunnel test section remains nowadays a difficult task due to numerous different effects reflection diffraction absorption that occur and disturb the radiated acoustic field that has to be evaluated since several years many researchers try to overcome this problem by different ways such as transfer functions tf as described for example by briançon marjollet et al 2013 or tani et al 2015 this technique is mainly used all over the world in cavitation tunnels because its experimental aspects and its easiness of performing the transfer function method is an empirical approach to correct all the acoustical effects and phenomena which can corrupt the acoustic field measurement this technique is a straightforward way ittc the specialist committee on hydrodynamics noise 2017 and is assumed taking into account the geometrical decay of the acoustic energy with distance the sensitivity of the sensor its sensitivity and its directivity and the acoustic response of the facility reverberation resonances etc for a perfectly controlled situation this approach is efficient by its own principle unfortunately some discrepancies can appear during the process the geometrical locations could be slightly different between the acoustic source during tf measurement and the noise source during urn measurement moreover most of the acoustic noise sources that are practically measured are moving they have generally a high dynamic and it is impossible to reproduce with an electro acoustic source it has been shown also that a tiny shift in space of the source could modify the response of the tf see for example boucheron et al 2017 due the modal response besides as reported by tani et al 2015 and boucheron 2019 the spread in the tf due to an error in the position of the acoustic source could be very important up to 10 db in a given bandwidth in consequence applying blindly such a technique could be incorrect and sometimes the correction should be worse than the raw data the description of the acoustic field is then one of the key point for an accurate measurement in a closed environment the limit between the two domains modal field diffuse field has been evaluated by schroeder in 1954 schroeder 1954 and modified in 1962 schroeder and kuttruff 1962 this limit called schroeder frequency derived originally in the room acoustic domain is expressed by 1 f s c c 0 3 4 ln 10 t r v with c 0 the celerity in the propagation medium v the volume of the room and t r the reverberation time this frequency is strongly linked to the critical distance see discussion by schroeder 1996 and gives an indication about the quality of diffusivity of the acoustic field consequently it is very useful when a noise measurement is performed inside a test section of a cavitation tunnel the knowledge of this frequency gives an indication about the acoustic behaviour of the facility at a working frequency it gives also some indications about the expected accuracy that can be reached for a given experimental configuration then this frequency appears as a parameter very useful during the results analysis however the application of this formula to the case of a test section of a cavitation tunnel is problematical for two main reasons firstly a cavitation tunnel is far to be similar of a room the volume v of the test section is small compared to the one of the tunnel acoustically what should be the length of the test section defining the volume to be used as it could be observed in the schematic drawn our large cavitation tunnel gth in fig 5 the increase of the size of the test section in the downstream direction but also in the upstream one is very slow for hydrodynamic issues this inhibits an accurate estimate of the length of the test section secondly the modes defined in the room acoustic domain are static modes even if they are composed of two modes that propagate in opposite direction whereas in the test section the modes propagate for these two reasons the application of the schroeder equation 1 seems impossible and has to be adapted to the case of a test section the aim of this paper is then to make this adaptation coming back to physical aspects of the acoustic propagation and some particular features of the propagation in ducts the paper is divided in two main sections the next section presents the theory derives the adapted schroeder frequency and describes the main features of each acoustic domain the third section is devoted to the description of two experimental campaigns performed to validate the above theory and to outline the main features of the statistics obtained in a test section of a cavitation tunnel 2 acoustic field description the acoustic field inside an environment such as a test section of a cavitation tunnel could be described by the modal theory this theory is available whatever the frequency from a practical point of view the application of such theory is only available up to a given frequency actually increasing the working frequency leads to a number of modes more important that way the consideration of each mode could become prohibitive since a given frequency beyond this frequency it should be possible and more practicable to use the statistics properties of the acoustic field to describe it the following subsection reminds the main details of the acoustic propagation in a duct with the modal theory for both a rectangular duct and a circular one most of the cavitation tunnels have a rectangular test section but it exists also some circular test section the derivation of the theory is then made for both shapes in order to be used in all the encountered cases 2 1 modal acoustic domain the solution to the helmholtz equation which describes the acoustic propagation could be expressed by the superposition of several modes according to the general equation morse and ingard 1968 2 p x y z t m n ψ m n a m n e j k x m n x b m n e j k x m n x e j ω t with ω the circular frequency of the wave k ω c 0 the wavenumber and j 1 here the direction of the propagation axis is x for a rectangular duct we use the cartesian coordinates in accordance with fig 1 left for a circular shape the cylindrical coordinates are preferred as depicted by the right part of fig 1 the axial wavenumber k x m n is associated to each mode m n m and n being the modal numbers for each direction eq 2 shows that acoustic propagation is considered in both directions upstream and downstream depending on the sign in the exponential part the coefficients a m n respectively b m n are the complex magnitudes of each mode associated to the downstream propagation respectively upstream propagation if hard walls are considered then the modal shape functions ψ m n r could be expressed in the case of a rectangular test section as see morse and ingard 1968 for example 3 ψ m n r y z cos m π l y y cos n π l z z with l y and l z the dimensions of the duct section over y and z respectively in the case of a circular duct section the modal shape functions ψ m n c are given by 4 ψ m n c r θ j m α r with α m n j m n r r denotes the radius of the duct section and j m are the bessel functions of first kind of order m the coefficient j m n is the n th zero of the derivative bessel function j m whatever the case considered these two eqs 3 and 4 could be used to derive the dispersion equation the general equation obtained for hard wall conditions could be written as k x m n ω c 0 2 k ψ m n 2 the coefficient k ψ depends on the modal shape function in rectangular case k ψ m n 2 m π l y 2 n π l z 2 whereas in circular case k ψ m n 2 α m n 2 therefore it could be observed that increasing the mode number m and or n leads to higher values for the k ψ m n as a consequence the axial wavenumber k x m n decreases with increasing mode number beyond a given limit the solution for k x m n is fully complex which indicates that the mode is evanescent no energy propagates this limit between the propagating evanescent domain is called cut off frequency and is defined by an axial wavenumber k x m n equals to zero for the rectangular case it yields 5 f m n c u t r c 0 2 m l y 2 n l z 2 while in circular ducts we obtain f m n c u t c c 0 2 π r j m n the two above equations give the cut off frequency for a given mode a given set of modal numbers m and n the following two paragraphs derive the modal density for the two considered cases rectangular and circular 2 1 1 rectangular modal density for the rectangular case the number of modes could be easily computed actually the quantity c 0 2 l y has the dimension of a frequency see eq 5 if we represent on a graph a spatial frequency on each axis in y and z direction it is then possible to number the propagating modes for a given configuration let call the two axes ν y and ν z we fix the working frequency to f this frequency could be represented by a circle of radius f as depicted in fig 2 the principle consists of dividing the plane into unit pavement which dimensions are scaled by the test section dimensions l y and l z each intersection of horizontal and vertical lines corresponds to a particular mode because each node of the grid could be expressed by eq 5 with indexes m and n both integer if this node is inside the red circle of radius f the mode is propagating that way the number of axial modes on y that is modes with any integer m and n 0 is simply computed by n a x y f c 0 2 l y 2 l y c 0 f carrying out the same calculus for the z yields to a total number of axial modes n a x 2 l y c 0 f 2 l z c 0 f l 2 c 0 f with l 4 l y l z slanted modes modes defined with both modal numbers different from 0 are represented by the nodes of the grid inside the quarter of the red circle the total number of these modes equals approximately the ratio between the red surface and the unit pavement surface subtracting the axial modes number ever contained in this calculus we obtain then n s l π f 2 4 c 0 2 4 l y l z 1 2 l 2 c 0 f π s c 0 2 f 2 l 4 c 0 f with s l y l z the surface of the test section then the total number of non evanescent modes at a working frequency f could be computed by 6 n r π s c 0 2 f 2 l 4 c 0 f the modal density is then easily obtained we reach for the rectangular case f n r r e c t 4 c 0 2 8 π s f c 0 l 2 1 2 circular modal density the same derivation has to be led for the circular case unfortunately a graphical description of the mode dispersion is not easy due to the bessel functions fortunately the roots of the derivative bessel functions are well known by mathematicians indeed for a given order m the roots j m n obey the following laws equation 9 5 13 from abramowitz and stegun 1970 j m n n m 2 3 4 π then for a given order m the number of modes could be evaluated by n k r π 3 4 m 2 this equation is available as long as m and n are high enough it gives the number of modes for a given order m to obtain the total number of non evanescent modes we have just to add all these modes thus it could be expressed as n c m 0 m 0 k r π 3 4 m 2 with m 0 the maximum order for modes that propagates corresponding to the first evanescent axi symmetric mode at the frequency f the first root of the derivative bessel function gets also particular properties if m is high enough the following equation could be used see 9 5 16 in abramowitz and stegun 1970 j m 1 m ξ m 1 3 o m 1 3 with ξ 0 8086165 the maximal order m 0 is then approximately k r ξ k r 1 3 after some mathematical derivations we obtain the total number of modes in the circular case according to 7 n c k r 2 1 π 1 4 1 ξ 2 which allows in return to express the modal density for the circular duct case as f n c c i r c ξ 2 c 0 2 8 π 2 r 2 f 1 π 1 4 as a validation of the above equations fig 3 presents the comparison between the experimental number of modes and the model eq 6 for the rectangular case at the top of the figure and eq 7 for the circular duct at the bottom of the figure the two agreements between experimental modes and the equation are very good even for low frequencies this is remarkable because some assumptions used especially for the circular case with bessel properties are normally available for high numbers thanks to these results the schroeder frequency could be derived from the modal density it is proposed in the following paragraph 2 2 derivation of the schroeder frequency modal density in an acoustic environment is responsible for both the homogenization of the acoustic field and also the diffuse quality of this field beyond a given frequency resonant modes are so numerous and close to each other s that resonances could not be observed acoustic energy dissipation does not depend on modal resonance but could be evaluated with the reverberation time at the working frequency the dissipation factor δ defined by schroeder 1954 as δ 3 ln 10 t r is linked to the reverberation time in the room t r reverberation which could be measured experimentally t r is defined as the sabine reverberation time that is the time lag required for a 60 db fall of the acoustic energy environment response could be considered statistically uniform when the frequency gap defined by the gap between two modal resonant peaks is small enough this limit has been proposed in 1954 and refined in 1962 as 8 f n 1 3 δ π applying this criterion to the modal density computed before allows to express the schroeder frequencies in acoustic duct cases we obtain then f r e c t 0 2171 t r c 0 2 s and f c i r c 0 5196 t r c 0 2 s these equations have been obtained by adjusting only the modal density found in an acoustic duct this modal density could also be computed with other test section shapes and other conditions if necessary moreover it is well known see morse and ingard 1968 or pierce 1989 that the boundary conditions modify the shape of each mode and the cut off frequencies even if these modifications have to be taken into account for an accurate mode number and consequently an accurate modal density it has to be noticed that the cut off frequencies are slightly shifted generally downward the main consequence is that modes appear earlier and the density is slightly increased this shift if not significant compared to the whole bandwidth of interest it was not judged important for our application that is just deriving an order of magnitude of the limit between the two domains in the same manner the measurements of real sources are always performed with a flow its presence modifies the shape of the pressure profiles and shifts the cut off frequencies downward or upward boucheron 2016 rienstra and hirschberg 2008 according to the direction of the flow compared to the direction of propagation nevertheless the frequency shift introduced by the flow is again assumed small enough to consider the above theory trustworthy in the practical cases 2 3 diffuse acoustic domain above the schroeder frequency and far away from the source the acoustic domain is then supposed to be uniform diffuse and statistical the statistical features like the average value and the standard deviations of the sound pressure level could be derived two distinct cases have to be described the first one is the reverberant field that exists when only a pure sine wave is generated by an acoustic source for such a configuration the acoustic energy p 2 has to follow a poisson distribution in space see for example pierce 1989 we define firstly the variable z ln 10 10 l p l 0 with l 0 the sound pressure level of the average of acoustic energy in space this variable z represents consequently the spread of the measured sound pressure level in space its probability density function is then similar to a gumbel distribution expressed as 9 w z e z e z mathematically the expected value z could be computed and equals γ γ being the euler mascheroni constant 1 1 abramowitz and stegun 1970 γ 0 5772157 therefore the expected sound pressure level is then l 0 2 5 db moreover it could be also demonstrated that the standard deviation around the average level l is 10 ln 10 π 6 5 6 db the second case to be considered is the case when broadband noise is used it could be proved see again pierce 1989 that the probability density function could be written as w m z m m e m z e m z with m a parameter which can be seen as a variable proportional to the number of individual frequencies inside the bandwidth with the time scale τ defined as the reverberation time t r divided by 6 ln 10 it is possible to link statistically these parameters by 10 m 1 ζ τ δ ω with ζ x 2 x arctan x ln 1 x 2 x the representation of the level distributions for different values of m is given in fig 4 it could be observed that the statistics are fully different between the pure sine case and the broadband noise if m increases the distribution tends to reduce the deviation from the average and converges towards a peak on the contrary for a pure sine wave the distribution is spread over the space the difference of behaviour of the acoustic field could be exploited experimentally this is done at the end of the article with the experimental data obtained in the gth 3 experimental validation since its first use in 1988 the large cavitation tunnel gth remains a performing experimental facility to conduct innovative experiments to improve the design of ship propulsors especially with regard to cavitation but also in hydroacoustic domain the gth is a close circuit tunnel of demineralized water fully comparable to wind tunnel in aerodynamic domain it is mainly composed by two test sections as shown by fig 5 each test section is equipped with large perspex windows allowing high visibility on model and also laser or high speed video measurements while one test section is in use model preparation can be done on the other one as each test section can be isolated using closing doors located downstream and upstream the two test sections the small test section dimensions 1 14 m 1 14 m 6 m is more dedicated to studies at very high speed up to 20 m s 1 while the large test section dimensions 2 m 1 35 m 10 m is more dedicated to propeller tests with complete hull apparatus the water velocity is continuously variable 0 v 20 m s 1 for the small test section and 0 v 12 m s 1 for the large test section the pressure is also continuously adjustable in the range 5 kpa p 500 kpa see lecoffre et al 1987 for more information on gth moreover air content is controlled and can be adjusted as the nuclei content necessary for cavitation testing for example the gth is equipped with an efficient de aeration process for its 3600 m 3 of water as shown by fig 6 due to the low background noise of the gth noise scale measurements are practicable in this facility as it could be observed on fig 6 the test section is a small part of the facility measurements have been performed inside the gth to validate the above theory the experimental configuration and the results are presented in the following paragraph two different campaigns have been done the first one is dedicated to the reverberation time measurement it is presented in section 3 1 the second campaign devoted to the measurements of the transfer functions and the estimate of the schroeder frequency in the test section is presented in section 3 2 3 1 reverberation time measurements 3 1 1 experimental configuration the particular design of a cavitation tunnel makes the test section the smallest part of the tunnel the dissipation inside the test section is then expected to be faster than the global tunnel actually the test section looks like a corridor between the downstream separating tank and the resorber these two large volumes are predominant in maintaining the acoustic energy in the facility acoustic energy absorption is mainly due to the different walls of the gth consequently the geometrical configuration makes the decay of the acoustic level generated by a source inside the test section specific to demonstrate this behaviour two different measurement configurations have been investigated for the reverberation decay time measurements the acoustic source has been placed inside the test section as hydrophones for the measurements as presented by fig 7 at left in a second step the source has been moved into the large downstream tank devoted to separate bubbles from flow when bubbles injection are used this configuration is presented in fig 7 at right the measurements are performed in both cases with the same hydrophones in the test section and without any flow in the tunnel 3 1 2 results fig 8 and fig 9 present the acoustic energy decay in decibel for the cases with the source inside the test section and the source inside the downstream tank respectively we observe in fig 8 that the decay exhibits a two steps behaviour the first step is a quick decay the pink part of the decay just after the source extinction and quasi linear in db with time this first step is followed by a non linear decay depicted in red slower than the first step the first step is similar to the early decay time that is encountered in room acoustic domain these two steps are not visible on the decay response when the source is located inside the large downstream tank fig 9 the decay is straight out slower than the configuration with the acoustic source in the test section this is due to the large volumes of the gth called downstream tank and resorber in fig 6 that drive the decay of energy in the whole tunnel from our opinion this difference accounts for substituting the t r by the e d t in the schroeder frequency formula for its application in cavitation tunnel because the dissipation of the energy is more related to the first part of the decay than the global decay itself more linked to the whole cavitation tunnel environment 3 2 validation of the schroeder frequency this section is dedicated to the second experimental campaign designed to assess the acoustic features of the diffuse field we firstly present the experimental apparatus 3 2 1 experimental configuration the test section of our cavitation tunnel has been equipped with 25 hydrophones as described in fig 10 hydrophones have been gathered in the same area relatively far away from the location of the acoustic source it ensures that at least for medium frequencies around few khz hydrophones are located in the diffuse field because the distance from the source is greater than the critical distance the measurements of the acoustic pressure have been performed with an acquisition system running at a 200 khz sampling frequency excepted for the last experiment described at the end of the paper the measurements have been performed with a white noise signal it was sent to the acoustic source via an amplifier that provides enough power to get high signal to noise ratio for the hydrophone measurements the signal processing method is described in fig 11 the transfer functions are computed for each hydrophone with the acoustic source signal and expressed in fourier domain the statistics studied in this paper are the different values of these transfer functions at a given frequency for all the hydrophones it could be said that it is spatial statistics because we focus on data that are coming from different hydrophones spatially distributed 3 2 2 schroeder frequency by transfer function as commented by several authors in literature an accurate measurement of the schroeder frequency is still nowadays tricky nevertheless the measurement of a large set of different transfer functions could appear as a great data set to estimate the schroeder frequency a unique tf presents generally a lot of resonances and anti resonances due to the source and sensor positions that make the use of this tf very delicate particularly if the position of the source to be measured is not exactly the same as the source used for the tf moreover for near field measurements evanescent waves generally omitted in most of practical uses have to be taken into account because they could exist close to the source boucheron et al 2017 hynninen et al 2017 on the contrary for the frequencies higher than the schroeder frequency the acoustic field is composed of the direct free field and a diffuse field statistically homogeneous in the whole space domain the number of modes is so important than the tf is smoother and a statistical description of the acoustic field is adopted the tf is measured by averaging different tfs performed at several positions of the source tani et al 2019 the application of the tf in the statistical domain appears more efficient than in the modal domain it is then important for a relevant analysis of the results obtained experimentally to determine the order of magnitude of the schroeder frequency beyond the experimental interest for correcting measurements performing statistics on a whole data set of tfs measured in our facility could give information s about the value of this frequency inside the bandwidth for modal domain application the tf is highly dependent on the position of the source and the receiver the position of the source will make a given mode emerging or not while the position of the receiver will make the magnitude measurement weighted by the modal shape the emergence of a mode will be fully different if the source is slightly shifted boucheron et al 2017 rienstra and hirschberg 2008 consequently measuring several tfs with different hydrophones located at different positions over the test section could produce high differences in this bandwidth conversely for frequencies higher than the schroeder frequency the statistical acoustic field is expected to be smoother and the variations between the different tfs should be smaller firstly the repeatability of the tf measurements with the acoustic source at the same position is presented in fig 12 among all the measurements performed the first ten results are represented the average tf is plotted with the black bold curve and each individual measurement by a coloured curve a good repeatability of the measurements could be observed even if some small discrepancies sometimes appear see the zoom area on the right in a second step we present in fig 13 the curves of forty individual tfs measured with different hydrophone locations and or source locations in the gth the black bold curve represents the averaged tf computed with these forty tfs it is worth mentioning the impressive dispersion observed in fig 13 compared to the one of fig 12 the position effect of source and or hydrophone is clearly observed the repeatability result ensures that the tf measurement set up is great enough to be able to discuss the dispersion observed when changing the set up parameters moreover theoretically the cut off frequency for the first non plane mode is around 370 hz computed with hard wall conditions above this frequency the modal propagation occurs it could be observed in fig 13 that high variations happen with several resonance humps and hollows which seem to be less important beyond around 10 khz during the dedicated experimental campaign a full data set of 864 tfs in different configurations has been acquired the standard deviation of the tfs computed frequency by frequency is represented in fig 14 the behaviour of the standard deviation against frequency black curve on fig 14 is interesting for very low frequencies the standard deviation could be estimated around 2 db in the modal domain the variation is higher as expected and the spread of tf is around 4 db between 700 hz and 5 khz above 5 khz the standard deviation decreases that is also expected to reach the value of 2 5 db around 20 khz for very high frequencies the standard deviation increases this behaviour is not linked to the statistical acoustic field but is more probably due to the directivity of the hydrophones actually the hydrophones used are not omnidirectional for such high frequencies that makes the tfs dependent on the received angles it could be observed that there is not a sharp threshold with a clear step between the modal and statistical domains but more something converging slowly the decay of the standard deviation represented by the red curve in fig 14 allows the determination of the schroeder frequency with the help of a threshold as explained in previous paragraph the formulae for the schroeder frequency in rectangular and circular case are available in duct and linked to the limit defined by the dissipation δ from eq 8 this limit adopted until now was the same as the one adopted by schroeder and kuttruff 1962 it has been historically adjusted thanks to the comparison between the theory schroeder 1954 and both the experimental results and monte carlo simulations such adjustment has to be performed to assess the correct coefficient for the formula in the case of a duct and particularly for a test section of a cavitation tunnel in accordance with this procedure a new threshold α for the dissipation coefficient could be proposed by the following equation f n α δ π the link between the coefficient α and the experimental data is shown in fig 15 the top graph shows the evolution of the coefficient α against the frequency black curve and the historical value given by schroeder and available in room acoustics blue dashed line the bottom graph presents the decay of the standard deviation measured in the gth against frequency taking a threshold of 3 db for the standard deviation leads to a coefficient α 0 266 using this threshold allows to express the schroeder frequency with adjustment to experimental results as f r e c t 0 2721 e d t c 0 2 s and f c i r c 0 6511 e d t c 0 2 s 3 3 diffuse field description as already mentioned previously above the schroeder frequency the acoustic field is assumed statistical theoretically the sound pressure level measured has to follow a gumbel distribution in space see paragraph 2 3 with parameter m which can be seen as a parameter proportional to the number of individual frequencies contained in the bandwidth used in the analysis process for m 1 the spatial distribution complies with a distribution very spread the gumbel distribution whereas when m increases this spatial distribution converges to a narrowed distribution with a more important peak centred close to the averaged sound pressure level see fig 4 below the schroeder frequency the distribution is assumed following a non symmetrical normal distribution according to the hydrophone locations distributions the crossover between the two domains defining the schroeder frequency is expected to be smooth and gradual between the two distinct distributions as explained by skålevik 2011 nevertheless if we want to assess experimentally such a distribution with a good accuracy we need a large number of data that is to say a very large number of hydrophones practically it is not possible to use hundreds of hydrophones to be able to estimate an accurate statistical distribution over space to overcome this problem it has to be noticed that the statistics do not depend on the working frequency as long as this frequency is higher than the schroeder one this offers the possibility to gather the data of all the high frequencies to generate a whole data set with many individual points that could be analysed as a unique one this method allows a large number of data and is useful for a statistical analysis as evoked above the gumbel distribution given by eq 9 has no parameter nevertheless it exists a generalized gumbel distribution that allows adjusting the average and the spread of the distribution to experimental data it is expressed by 11 w z μ σ e z μ σ e z μ σ this distribution has been used to fit the acquired data to a gumbel shape distribution by adjusting the mean μ and the standard deviation parameter σ in a least square sense processing in this way the comparison of the distribution obtained with the data gathered at frequencies higher than 15 khz assumed to be higher than the schroeder frequency is presented in fig 16 the measures are represented by black points the model of a generalized gumbel distribution adjusted to the data is plotted by the red curve a very good fit is obtained between experimental data and the model adjusted the deviation from the average value obtained with the model is about 2 52 db whereas the theory predict a shift of 2 51 db for a perfect gumbel distribution the standard deviation of the data around the mean value is experimentally around 5 65 db for a theoretical value of 5 57 db for the gumbel distribution these results valid the fact that in reverberation domain the acoustic field is statistical and complies with the gumbel distribution beyond the check of the gumbel behaviour of the statistical acoustic field at frequencies higher than the schroeder frequency a specific approach has been developed actually the parameter m of the spatial distribution depends on reverberation time and also on the bandwidth used for the analysis see eq 10 a convenient way to modify this parameter with the same data set is the analysis bandwidth for a large bandwidth δ ω the parameter m will be high and the distribution will be less spread with a thinner bandwidth the parameter m will decrease and the distribution will converge progressively on the gumbel distribution this phenomenon is well known by engineers performing the fourier transform with very disturbed fourier amplitude compared to averaged spectral signals obtained by welch method for example fig 17 presents the evolution of the model that could be adjusted to data with different bandwidth for convenience and visibility only the curves of the model adjusted to the data are represented the curves colour depends on the value of the bandwidth used for the analysis performed on the same data set it could be observed that the distribution shapes are converging towards a sharper one with a higher peak as long as δ ω increases hot colours the curves for the first 6 lowest bandwidth are superimposed on the graph and comply perfectly with a pure gumbel distribution μ 0 and σ 1 in eq 11 the gap between the most probable value and the spatial mean is 2 5 db the same as the theoretical one and is reduced when δ ω increases the value is indicated in the legend δ l and expressed in db the same curves for the low frequencies below the schroeder frequency are given in fig 18 the trend to converge towards a sharper distribution could also be observed the main difference between the two configurations low high frequencies is the fact that the distribution is not a gumbel one but more a non symmetrical normal distribution the most probable value is found closer to the spatial average one consequently the gap δ l between these values decreases even for very small bandwidth this gap does not reach the theoretical values given for statistical fields 2 5 db it indicates that the nature of the acoustic field is no more diffuse like in reverberant field therefore the nature of the acoustic field described just above could be used to estimate the schroeder frequency by a statistical approach the main idea is to perform measurements with a particular signal composed of a broadband white noise and pure sine waves superimposed as previously evoked the spectral density of such signals is given in fig 19 the signal used in this measurement is a white noise with sine waves at frequency every 100 hz between 500 hz and 25 khz each sine wave is emerging from the background spectra composed of white noise thus for a given frequency the analysis of the distribution with a small bandwidth centred on a pure sine wave is assumed to follow a gumbel distribution as long as the given frequency is beyond the schroeder frequency if the bandwidth does not contain a pure sine wave the broadband noise used must modify the distribution and has to fit a non symmetrical normal one the difference between the two regimes could be observed in the evolution of the deviation δ l against the frequency these results are shown in fig 20 it could be observed that at low frequencies the deviation δ l is similar between the results obtained by analysing the sine signal or the noise signal the absolute value in the modal domain depends mainly on the spatial distribution of the hydrophones regarding the modal magnitude shapes and also if these modes are excited by the source position or not consequently taking into account many modes it is hard to predict theoretically the expected value of the deviation the results are nevertheless consistent between the values obtained at low frequencies however for high frequencies we observe a difference between the two deviations obtained with sine or white noise signals this expected behaviour is clearly observed on fig 20 the sine signals results are very close slightly lower to the theoretical values of 2 5 db the deviation obtained for the noise is lower than expected theoretically for a gumbel distribution and close to 0 5 db the limit between the two domains modal diffuse could be observed as already remarked by skålevik 2011 in room acoustics the transition between the two domains is gradual and not sharp enough to allow an accurate evaluation of the limit the crossover region between the two domains is also observed in our results once again the use of a given threshold seems required to compute the so called schroeder frequency nevertheless it is worth noticing that the order of magnitude of the bandwidth in which the transition occurs is the same for the two experimental processes used in this paper finally following the discussion of skålevik in his paper skålevik 2011 the transition between the modal domain and the statistical domain is progressive the schroeder frequency has been defined originally by schroeder as the frequency high enough to maintain the validity of the statistical theory it could be then defined as the higher limit of the transition region it could also be defined as the lower bound of the transition region or also as the central frequency of this area anyway the use of the schroeder frequency as an indicator of the facility behaviour for the analysis of noise measurements in a cavitation tunnel requires only an order of magnitude regarding the consistent results obtained experimentally in this paper by two different ways and also the good agreement between the theory and the experimental values we are confident enough to propose the following equations for computing the schroeder frequency in cavitation tunnels f r e c t 0 2721 e d t c 0 2 s and f c i r c 0 6511 e d t c 0 2 s 4 conclusion the description of the acoustic field in a particular environment like a cavitation tunnel is one of the key point for an accurate estimate of the underwater radiated noise the geometrical configuration of such a measurement is far to be comparable to a free field the analysis of the results obtained during an experimental campaign has to be led with the knowledge of the acoustic field features at low frequencies modal domain is suitable for high frequencies the statistical approach remains the only practicable method the concept of the so called schroeder frequency delimiting the two domains is adapted to the case of the acoustic propagation in duct for both rectangular and circular shape sections the adaptation is required mainly because the original definition used two parameters the volume of the environment and the reverberation time that appear here to be not the more appropriated parameters for defining the physical problem a new formula is then derived for the schroeder frequency and adjusted to the gth measurements with the help of a threshold found not so far from the original threshold of the dissipation rate given by schroeder and kuttruff 1962 besides several experimental data sets of transfer function have been used to describe the statistics obtained for the acoustic field it has been demonstrated that the experimental diffuse acoustic field complies very well with a gumbel distribution as predicted by the theory whereas it is more similar to a non symmetrical normal distribution in the modal domain this particularity of the acoustic field statistics has been used as another way to estimate the schroeder frequency in the test section of our cavitation tunnel it has to be emphasized that the order of magnitude of the frequencies computed by the two approaches is the same however further studies are required to assess the accuracy of the equations of the schroeder frequency derived in this paper the threshold found here is close to the one defined historically but measurements and results from other facilities should be helpful to criticize the choice made here with our data these studies could be driven in other facilities or also by a numerical way with the help of monte carlo method for example declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
21718,noise measurements in a cavitation tunnel are the common procedure widely used by most of the institutes for predicting the underwater radiated noise urn of a boat propeller the accuracy of such a measurement is strongly linked to the acoustic response of the facility the knowledge of this acoustic behaviour is then one of the key point to perform an accurate measurement due to the geometrical shape of a test section the acoustic propagation is similar to propagation in duct this propagation could be described at low frequencies by modal propagation for higher frequencies the total number of propagating modes increases and the acoustics inside the duct becomes statistical schroeder described the limit between these two domains modal statistical in 1954 for closed space applications like room acoustics the formula derived in 1954 was completed and improved few years after to fit with results obtained by experiments and monte carlo simulations following the same effort the principle of this limiting frequency called here and henceforth schroeder frequency is derived to comply with particularities of the acoustic propagation in duct and to the environment of a test section of a cavitation tunnel because it exists cavitation tunnel with rectangular or circular test sections the adaptation of the schroeder equation is performed for both configurations the description of the statistical features of the acoustic field is also derived finally experiments have been carried out in our cavitation tunnel to assess the accuracy of the equation and more particularly the threshold used to delimit the two domains keywords acoustic measurements model scale reverberation transfer function statistical distributions 1 introduction since several decades marine propeller performances have always increased due to environmental requirements and future noise standards designers are nowadays concerned by acoustical stealth not only for military reasons but also for passenger ship comfort and impact of the underwater radiated noise on marine fauna the control of the radiated noise is usually performed at model scale in a dedicated facility mainly hydroacoustic cavitation tunnels depressurized tanks see lafeber et al 2015 or also circulating water channels felli et al 2015 the results obtained are then scaled to the full scale to predict the acoustic power radiated by the ship at sea measuring the acoustic field in an acoustic environment such as a cavitation tunnel test section remains nowadays a difficult task due to numerous different effects reflection diffraction absorption that occur and disturb the radiated acoustic field that has to be evaluated since several years many researchers try to overcome this problem by different ways such as transfer functions tf as described for example by briançon marjollet et al 2013 or tani et al 2015 this technique is mainly used all over the world in cavitation tunnels because its experimental aspects and its easiness of performing the transfer function method is an empirical approach to correct all the acoustical effects and phenomena which can corrupt the acoustic field measurement this technique is a straightforward way ittc the specialist committee on hydrodynamics noise 2017 and is assumed taking into account the geometrical decay of the acoustic energy with distance the sensitivity of the sensor its sensitivity and its directivity and the acoustic response of the facility reverberation resonances etc for a perfectly controlled situation this approach is efficient by its own principle unfortunately some discrepancies can appear during the process the geometrical locations could be slightly different between the acoustic source during tf measurement and the noise source during urn measurement moreover most of the acoustic noise sources that are practically measured are moving they have generally a high dynamic and it is impossible to reproduce with an electro acoustic source it has been shown also that a tiny shift in space of the source could modify the response of the tf see for example boucheron et al 2017 due the modal response besides as reported by tani et al 2015 and boucheron 2019 the spread in the tf due to an error in the position of the acoustic source could be very important up to 10 db in a given bandwidth in consequence applying blindly such a technique could be incorrect and sometimes the correction should be worse than the raw data the description of the acoustic field is then one of the key point for an accurate measurement in a closed environment the limit between the two domains modal field diffuse field has been evaluated by schroeder in 1954 schroeder 1954 and modified in 1962 schroeder and kuttruff 1962 this limit called schroeder frequency derived originally in the room acoustic domain is expressed by 1 f s c c 0 3 4 ln 10 t r v with c 0 the celerity in the propagation medium v the volume of the room and t r the reverberation time this frequency is strongly linked to the critical distance see discussion by schroeder 1996 and gives an indication about the quality of diffusivity of the acoustic field consequently it is very useful when a noise measurement is performed inside a test section of a cavitation tunnel the knowledge of this frequency gives an indication about the acoustic behaviour of the facility at a working frequency it gives also some indications about the expected accuracy that can be reached for a given experimental configuration then this frequency appears as a parameter very useful during the results analysis however the application of this formula to the case of a test section of a cavitation tunnel is problematical for two main reasons firstly a cavitation tunnel is far to be similar of a room the volume v of the test section is small compared to the one of the tunnel acoustically what should be the length of the test section defining the volume to be used as it could be observed in the schematic drawn our large cavitation tunnel gth in fig 5 the increase of the size of the test section in the downstream direction but also in the upstream one is very slow for hydrodynamic issues this inhibits an accurate estimate of the length of the test section secondly the modes defined in the room acoustic domain are static modes even if they are composed of two modes that propagate in opposite direction whereas in the test section the modes propagate for these two reasons the application of the schroeder equation 1 seems impossible and has to be adapted to the case of a test section the aim of this paper is then to make this adaptation coming back to physical aspects of the acoustic propagation and some particular features of the propagation in ducts the paper is divided in two main sections the next section presents the theory derives the adapted schroeder frequency and describes the main features of each acoustic domain the third section is devoted to the description of two experimental campaigns performed to validate the above theory and to outline the main features of the statistics obtained in a test section of a cavitation tunnel 2 acoustic field description the acoustic field inside an environment such as a test section of a cavitation tunnel could be described by the modal theory this theory is available whatever the frequency from a practical point of view the application of such theory is only available up to a given frequency actually increasing the working frequency leads to a number of modes more important that way the consideration of each mode could become prohibitive since a given frequency beyond this frequency it should be possible and more practicable to use the statistics properties of the acoustic field to describe it the following subsection reminds the main details of the acoustic propagation in a duct with the modal theory for both a rectangular duct and a circular one most of the cavitation tunnels have a rectangular test section but it exists also some circular test section the derivation of the theory is then made for both shapes in order to be used in all the encountered cases 2 1 modal acoustic domain the solution to the helmholtz equation which describes the acoustic propagation could be expressed by the superposition of several modes according to the general equation morse and ingard 1968 2 p x y z t m n ψ m n a m n e j k x m n x b m n e j k x m n x e j ω t with ω the circular frequency of the wave k ω c 0 the wavenumber and j 1 here the direction of the propagation axis is x for a rectangular duct we use the cartesian coordinates in accordance with fig 1 left for a circular shape the cylindrical coordinates are preferred as depicted by the right part of fig 1 the axial wavenumber k x m n is associated to each mode m n m and n being the modal numbers for each direction eq 2 shows that acoustic propagation is considered in both directions upstream and downstream depending on the sign in the exponential part the coefficients a m n respectively b m n are the complex magnitudes of each mode associated to the downstream propagation respectively upstream propagation if hard walls are considered then the modal shape functions ψ m n r could be expressed in the case of a rectangular test section as see morse and ingard 1968 for example 3 ψ m n r y z cos m π l y y cos n π l z z with l y and l z the dimensions of the duct section over y and z respectively in the case of a circular duct section the modal shape functions ψ m n c are given by 4 ψ m n c r θ j m α r with α m n j m n r r denotes the radius of the duct section and j m are the bessel functions of first kind of order m the coefficient j m n is the n th zero of the derivative bessel function j m whatever the case considered these two eqs 3 and 4 could be used to derive the dispersion equation the general equation obtained for hard wall conditions could be written as k x m n ω c 0 2 k ψ m n 2 the coefficient k ψ depends on the modal shape function in rectangular case k ψ m n 2 m π l y 2 n π l z 2 whereas in circular case k ψ m n 2 α m n 2 therefore it could be observed that increasing the mode number m and or n leads to higher values for the k ψ m n as a consequence the axial wavenumber k x m n decreases with increasing mode number beyond a given limit the solution for k x m n is fully complex which indicates that the mode is evanescent no energy propagates this limit between the propagating evanescent domain is called cut off frequency and is defined by an axial wavenumber k x m n equals to zero for the rectangular case it yields 5 f m n c u t r c 0 2 m l y 2 n l z 2 while in circular ducts we obtain f m n c u t c c 0 2 π r j m n the two above equations give the cut off frequency for a given mode a given set of modal numbers m and n the following two paragraphs derive the modal density for the two considered cases rectangular and circular 2 1 1 rectangular modal density for the rectangular case the number of modes could be easily computed actually the quantity c 0 2 l y has the dimension of a frequency see eq 5 if we represent on a graph a spatial frequency on each axis in y and z direction it is then possible to number the propagating modes for a given configuration let call the two axes ν y and ν z we fix the working frequency to f this frequency could be represented by a circle of radius f as depicted in fig 2 the principle consists of dividing the plane into unit pavement which dimensions are scaled by the test section dimensions l y and l z each intersection of horizontal and vertical lines corresponds to a particular mode because each node of the grid could be expressed by eq 5 with indexes m and n both integer if this node is inside the red circle of radius f the mode is propagating that way the number of axial modes on y that is modes with any integer m and n 0 is simply computed by n a x y f c 0 2 l y 2 l y c 0 f carrying out the same calculus for the z yields to a total number of axial modes n a x 2 l y c 0 f 2 l z c 0 f l 2 c 0 f with l 4 l y l z slanted modes modes defined with both modal numbers different from 0 are represented by the nodes of the grid inside the quarter of the red circle the total number of these modes equals approximately the ratio between the red surface and the unit pavement surface subtracting the axial modes number ever contained in this calculus we obtain then n s l π f 2 4 c 0 2 4 l y l z 1 2 l 2 c 0 f π s c 0 2 f 2 l 4 c 0 f with s l y l z the surface of the test section then the total number of non evanescent modes at a working frequency f could be computed by 6 n r π s c 0 2 f 2 l 4 c 0 f the modal density is then easily obtained we reach for the rectangular case f n r r e c t 4 c 0 2 8 π s f c 0 l 2 1 2 circular modal density the same derivation has to be led for the circular case unfortunately a graphical description of the mode dispersion is not easy due to the bessel functions fortunately the roots of the derivative bessel functions are well known by mathematicians indeed for a given order m the roots j m n obey the following laws equation 9 5 13 from abramowitz and stegun 1970 j m n n m 2 3 4 π then for a given order m the number of modes could be evaluated by n k r π 3 4 m 2 this equation is available as long as m and n are high enough it gives the number of modes for a given order m to obtain the total number of non evanescent modes we have just to add all these modes thus it could be expressed as n c m 0 m 0 k r π 3 4 m 2 with m 0 the maximum order for modes that propagates corresponding to the first evanescent axi symmetric mode at the frequency f the first root of the derivative bessel function gets also particular properties if m is high enough the following equation could be used see 9 5 16 in abramowitz and stegun 1970 j m 1 m ξ m 1 3 o m 1 3 with ξ 0 8086165 the maximal order m 0 is then approximately k r ξ k r 1 3 after some mathematical derivations we obtain the total number of modes in the circular case according to 7 n c k r 2 1 π 1 4 1 ξ 2 which allows in return to express the modal density for the circular duct case as f n c c i r c ξ 2 c 0 2 8 π 2 r 2 f 1 π 1 4 as a validation of the above equations fig 3 presents the comparison between the experimental number of modes and the model eq 6 for the rectangular case at the top of the figure and eq 7 for the circular duct at the bottom of the figure the two agreements between experimental modes and the equation are very good even for low frequencies this is remarkable because some assumptions used especially for the circular case with bessel properties are normally available for high numbers thanks to these results the schroeder frequency could be derived from the modal density it is proposed in the following paragraph 2 2 derivation of the schroeder frequency modal density in an acoustic environment is responsible for both the homogenization of the acoustic field and also the diffuse quality of this field beyond a given frequency resonant modes are so numerous and close to each other s that resonances could not be observed acoustic energy dissipation does not depend on modal resonance but could be evaluated with the reverberation time at the working frequency the dissipation factor δ defined by schroeder 1954 as δ 3 ln 10 t r is linked to the reverberation time in the room t r reverberation which could be measured experimentally t r is defined as the sabine reverberation time that is the time lag required for a 60 db fall of the acoustic energy environment response could be considered statistically uniform when the frequency gap defined by the gap between two modal resonant peaks is small enough this limit has been proposed in 1954 and refined in 1962 as 8 f n 1 3 δ π applying this criterion to the modal density computed before allows to express the schroeder frequencies in acoustic duct cases we obtain then f r e c t 0 2171 t r c 0 2 s and f c i r c 0 5196 t r c 0 2 s these equations have been obtained by adjusting only the modal density found in an acoustic duct this modal density could also be computed with other test section shapes and other conditions if necessary moreover it is well known see morse and ingard 1968 or pierce 1989 that the boundary conditions modify the shape of each mode and the cut off frequencies even if these modifications have to be taken into account for an accurate mode number and consequently an accurate modal density it has to be noticed that the cut off frequencies are slightly shifted generally downward the main consequence is that modes appear earlier and the density is slightly increased this shift if not significant compared to the whole bandwidth of interest it was not judged important for our application that is just deriving an order of magnitude of the limit between the two domains in the same manner the measurements of real sources are always performed with a flow its presence modifies the shape of the pressure profiles and shifts the cut off frequencies downward or upward boucheron 2016 rienstra and hirschberg 2008 according to the direction of the flow compared to the direction of propagation nevertheless the frequency shift introduced by the flow is again assumed small enough to consider the above theory trustworthy in the practical cases 2 3 diffuse acoustic domain above the schroeder frequency and far away from the source the acoustic domain is then supposed to be uniform diffuse and statistical the statistical features like the average value and the standard deviations of the sound pressure level could be derived two distinct cases have to be described the first one is the reverberant field that exists when only a pure sine wave is generated by an acoustic source for such a configuration the acoustic energy p 2 has to follow a poisson distribution in space see for example pierce 1989 we define firstly the variable z ln 10 10 l p l 0 with l 0 the sound pressure level of the average of acoustic energy in space this variable z represents consequently the spread of the measured sound pressure level in space its probability density function is then similar to a gumbel distribution expressed as 9 w z e z e z mathematically the expected value z could be computed and equals γ γ being the euler mascheroni constant 1 1 abramowitz and stegun 1970 γ 0 5772157 therefore the expected sound pressure level is then l 0 2 5 db moreover it could be also demonstrated that the standard deviation around the average level l is 10 ln 10 π 6 5 6 db the second case to be considered is the case when broadband noise is used it could be proved see again pierce 1989 that the probability density function could be written as w m z m m e m z e m z with m a parameter which can be seen as a variable proportional to the number of individual frequencies inside the bandwidth with the time scale τ defined as the reverberation time t r divided by 6 ln 10 it is possible to link statistically these parameters by 10 m 1 ζ τ δ ω with ζ x 2 x arctan x ln 1 x 2 x the representation of the level distributions for different values of m is given in fig 4 it could be observed that the statistics are fully different between the pure sine case and the broadband noise if m increases the distribution tends to reduce the deviation from the average and converges towards a peak on the contrary for a pure sine wave the distribution is spread over the space the difference of behaviour of the acoustic field could be exploited experimentally this is done at the end of the article with the experimental data obtained in the gth 3 experimental validation since its first use in 1988 the large cavitation tunnel gth remains a performing experimental facility to conduct innovative experiments to improve the design of ship propulsors especially with regard to cavitation but also in hydroacoustic domain the gth is a close circuit tunnel of demineralized water fully comparable to wind tunnel in aerodynamic domain it is mainly composed by two test sections as shown by fig 5 each test section is equipped with large perspex windows allowing high visibility on model and also laser or high speed video measurements while one test section is in use model preparation can be done on the other one as each test section can be isolated using closing doors located downstream and upstream the two test sections the small test section dimensions 1 14 m 1 14 m 6 m is more dedicated to studies at very high speed up to 20 m s 1 while the large test section dimensions 2 m 1 35 m 10 m is more dedicated to propeller tests with complete hull apparatus the water velocity is continuously variable 0 v 20 m s 1 for the small test section and 0 v 12 m s 1 for the large test section the pressure is also continuously adjustable in the range 5 kpa p 500 kpa see lecoffre et al 1987 for more information on gth moreover air content is controlled and can be adjusted as the nuclei content necessary for cavitation testing for example the gth is equipped with an efficient de aeration process for its 3600 m 3 of water as shown by fig 6 due to the low background noise of the gth noise scale measurements are practicable in this facility as it could be observed on fig 6 the test section is a small part of the facility measurements have been performed inside the gth to validate the above theory the experimental configuration and the results are presented in the following paragraph two different campaigns have been done the first one is dedicated to the reverberation time measurement it is presented in section 3 1 the second campaign devoted to the measurements of the transfer functions and the estimate of the schroeder frequency in the test section is presented in section 3 2 3 1 reverberation time measurements 3 1 1 experimental configuration the particular design of a cavitation tunnel makes the test section the smallest part of the tunnel the dissipation inside the test section is then expected to be faster than the global tunnel actually the test section looks like a corridor between the downstream separating tank and the resorber these two large volumes are predominant in maintaining the acoustic energy in the facility acoustic energy absorption is mainly due to the different walls of the gth consequently the geometrical configuration makes the decay of the acoustic level generated by a source inside the test section specific to demonstrate this behaviour two different measurement configurations have been investigated for the reverberation decay time measurements the acoustic source has been placed inside the test section as hydrophones for the measurements as presented by fig 7 at left in a second step the source has been moved into the large downstream tank devoted to separate bubbles from flow when bubbles injection are used this configuration is presented in fig 7 at right the measurements are performed in both cases with the same hydrophones in the test section and without any flow in the tunnel 3 1 2 results fig 8 and fig 9 present the acoustic energy decay in decibel for the cases with the source inside the test section and the source inside the downstream tank respectively we observe in fig 8 that the decay exhibits a two steps behaviour the first step is a quick decay the pink part of the decay just after the source extinction and quasi linear in db with time this first step is followed by a non linear decay depicted in red slower than the first step the first step is similar to the early decay time that is encountered in room acoustic domain these two steps are not visible on the decay response when the source is located inside the large downstream tank fig 9 the decay is straight out slower than the configuration with the acoustic source in the test section this is due to the large volumes of the gth called downstream tank and resorber in fig 6 that drive the decay of energy in the whole tunnel from our opinion this difference accounts for substituting the t r by the e d t in the schroeder frequency formula for its application in cavitation tunnel because the dissipation of the energy is more related to the first part of the decay than the global decay itself more linked to the whole cavitation tunnel environment 3 2 validation of the schroeder frequency this section is dedicated to the second experimental campaign designed to assess the acoustic features of the diffuse field we firstly present the experimental apparatus 3 2 1 experimental configuration the test section of our cavitation tunnel has been equipped with 25 hydrophones as described in fig 10 hydrophones have been gathered in the same area relatively far away from the location of the acoustic source it ensures that at least for medium frequencies around few khz hydrophones are located in the diffuse field because the distance from the source is greater than the critical distance the measurements of the acoustic pressure have been performed with an acquisition system running at a 200 khz sampling frequency excepted for the last experiment described at the end of the paper the measurements have been performed with a white noise signal it was sent to the acoustic source via an amplifier that provides enough power to get high signal to noise ratio for the hydrophone measurements the signal processing method is described in fig 11 the transfer functions are computed for each hydrophone with the acoustic source signal and expressed in fourier domain the statistics studied in this paper are the different values of these transfer functions at a given frequency for all the hydrophones it could be said that it is spatial statistics because we focus on data that are coming from different hydrophones spatially distributed 3 2 2 schroeder frequency by transfer function as commented by several authors in literature an accurate measurement of the schroeder frequency is still nowadays tricky nevertheless the measurement of a large set of different transfer functions could appear as a great data set to estimate the schroeder frequency a unique tf presents generally a lot of resonances and anti resonances due to the source and sensor positions that make the use of this tf very delicate particularly if the position of the source to be measured is not exactly the same as the source used for the tf moreover for near field measurements evanescent waves generally omitted in most of practical uses have to be taken into account because they could exist close to the source boucheron et al 2017 hynninen et al 2017 on the contrary for the frequencies higher than the schroeder frequency the acoustic field is composed of the direct free field and a diffuse field statistically homogeneous in the whole space domain the number of modes is so important than the tf is smoother and a statistical description of the acoustic field is adopted the tf is measured by averaging different tfs performed at several positions of the source tani et al 2019 the application of the tf in the statistical domain appears more efficient than in the modal domain it is then important for a relevant analysis of the results obtained experimentally to determine the order of magnitude of the schroeder frequency beyond the experimental interest for correcting measurements performing statistics on a whole data set of tfs measured in our facility could give information s about the value of this frequency inside the bandwidth for modal domain application the tf is highly dependent on the position of the source and the receiver the position of the source will make a given mode emerging or not while the position of the receiver will make the magnitude measurement weighted by the modal shape the emergence of a mode will be fully different if the source is slightly shifted boucheron et al 2017 rienstra and hirschberg 2008 consequently measuring several tfs with different hydrophones located at different positions over the test section could produce high differences in this bandwidth conversely for frequencies higher than the schroeder frequency the statistical acoustic field is expected to be smoother and the variations between the different tfs should be smaller firstly the repeatability of the tf measurements with the acoustic source at the same position is presented in fig 12 among all the measurements performed the first ten results are represented the average tf is plotted with the black bold curve and each individual measurement by a coloured curve a good repeatability of the measurements could be observed even if some small discrepancies sometimes appear see the zoom area on the right in a second step we present in fig 13 the curves of forty individual tfs measured with different hydrophone locations and or source locations in the gth the black bold curve represents the averaged tf computed with these forty tfs it is worth mentioning the impressive dispersion observed in fig 13 compared to the one of fig 12 the position effect of source and or hydrophone is clearly observed the repeatability result ensures that the tf measurement set up is great enough to be able to discuss the dispersion observed when changing the set up parameters moreover theoretically the cut off frequency for the first non plane mode is around 370 hz computed with hard wall conditions above this frequency the modal propagation occurs it could be observed in fig 13 that high variations happen with several resonance humps and hollows which seem to be less important beyond around 10 khz during the dedicated experimental campaign a full data set of 864 tfs in different configurations has been acquired the standard deviation of the tfs computed frequency by frequency is represented in fig 14 the behaviour of the standard deviation against frequency black curve on fig 14 is interesting for very low frequencies the standard deviation could be estimated around 2 db in the modal domain the variation is higher as expected and the spread of tf is around 4 db between 700 hz and 5 khz above 5 khz the standard deviation decreases that is also expected to reach the value of 2 5 db around 20 khz for very high frequencies the standard deviation increases this behaviour is not linked to the statistical acoustic field but is more probably due to the directivity of the hydrophones actually the hydrophones used are not omnidirectional for such high frequencies that makes the tfs dependent on the received angles it could be observed that there is not a sharp threshold with a clear step between the modal and statistical domains but more something converging slowly the decay of the standard deviation represented by the red curve in fig 14 allows the determination of the schroeder frequency with the help of a threshold as explained in previous paragraph the formulae for the schroeder frequency in rectangular and circular case are available in duct and linked to the limit defined by the dissipation δ from eq 8 this limit adopted until now was the same as the one adopted by schroeder and kuttruff 1962 it has been historically adjusted thanks to the comparison between the theory schroeder 1954 and both the experimental results and monte carlo simulations such adjustment has to be performed to assess the correct coefficient for the formula in the case of a duct and particularly for a test section of a cavitation tunnel in accordance with this procedure a new threshold α for the dissipation coefficient could be proposed by the following equation f n α δ π the link between the coefficient α and the experimental data is shown in fig 15 the top graph shows the evolution of the coefficient α against the frequency black curve and the historical value given by schroeder and available in room acoustics blue dashed line the bottom graph presents the decay of the standard deviation measured in the gth against frequency taking a threshold of 3 db for the standard deviation leads to a coefficient α 0 266 using this threshold allows to express the schroeder frequency with adjustment to experimental results as f r e c t 0 2721 e d t c 0 2 s and f c i r c 0 6511 e d t c 0 2 s 3 3 diffuse field description as already mentioned previously above the schroeder frequency the acoustic field is assumed statistical theoretically the sound pressure level measured has to follow a gumbel distribution in space see paragraph 2 3 with parameter m which can be seen as a parameter proportional to the number of individual frequencies contained in the bandwidth used in the analysis process for m 1 the spatial distribution complies with a distribution very spread the gumbel distribution whereas when m increases this spatial distribution converges to a narrowed distribution with a more important peak centred close to the averaged sound pressure level see fig 4 below the schroeder frequency the distribution is assumed following a non symmetrical normal distribution according to the hydrophone locations distributions the crossover between the two domains defining the schroeder frequency is expected to be smooth and gradual between the two distinct distributions as explained by skålevik 2011 nevertheless if we want to assess experimentally such a distribution with a good accuracy we need a large number of data that is to say a very large number of hydrophones practically it is not possible to use hundreds of hydrophones to be able to estimate an accurate statistical distribution over space to overcome this problem it has to be noticed that the statistics do not depend on the working frequency as long as this frequency is higher than the schroeder one this offers the possibility to gather the data of all the high frequencies to generate a whole data set with many individual points that could be analysed as a unique one this method allows a large number of data and is useful for a statistical analysis as evoked above the gumbel distribution given by eq 9 has no parameter nevertheless it exists a generalized gumbel distribution that allows adjusting the average and the spread of the distribution to experimental data it is expressed by 11 w z μ σ e z μ σ e z μ σ this distribution has been used to fit the acquired data to a gumbel shape distribution by adjusting the mean μ and the standard deviation parameter σ in a least square sense processing in this way the comparison of the distribution obtained with the data gathered at frequencies higher than 15 khz assumed to be higher than the schroeder frequency is presented in fig 16 the measures are represented by black points the model of a generalized gumbel distribution adjusted to the data is plotted by the red curve a very good fit is obtained between experimental data and the model adjusted the deviation from the average value obtained with the model is about 2 52 db whereas the theory predict a shift of 2 51 db for a perfect gumbel distribution the standard deviation of the data around the mean value is experimentally around 5 65 db for a theoretical value of 5 57 db for the gumbel distribution these results valid the fact that in reverberation domain the acoustic field is statistical and complies with the gumbel distribution beyond the check of the gumbel behaviour of the statistical acoustic field at frequencies higher than the schroeder frequency a specific approach has been developed actually the parameter m of the spatial distribution depends on reverberation time and also on the bandwidth used for the analysis see eq 10 a convenient way to modify this parameter with the same data set is the analysis bandwidth for a large bandwidth δ ω the parameter m will be high and the distribution will be less spread with a thinner bandwidth the parameter m will decrease and the distribution will converge progressively on the gumbel distribution this phenomenon is well known by engineers performing the fourier transform with very disturbed fourier amplitude compared to averaged spectral signals obtained by welch method for example fig 17 presents the evolution of the model that could be adjusted to data with different bandwidth for convenience and visibility only the curves of the model adjusted to the data are represented the curves colour depends on the value of the bandwidth used for the analysis performed on the same data set it could be observed that the distribution shapes are converging towards a sharper one with a higher peak as long as δ ω increases hot colours the curves for the first 6 lowest bandwidth are superimposed on the graph and comply perfectly with a pure gumbel distribution μ 0 and σ 1 in eq 11 the gap between the most probable value and the spatial mean is 2 5 db the same as the theoretical one and is reduced when δ ω increases the value is indicated in the legend δ l and expressed in db the same curves for the low frequencies below the schroeder frequency are given in fig 18 the trend to converge towards a sharper distribution could also be observed the main difference between the two configurations low high frequencies is the fact that the distribution is not a gumbel one but more a non symmetrical normal distribution the most probable value is found closer to the spatial average one consequently the gap δ l between these values decreases even for very small bandwidth this gap does not reach the theoretical values given for statistical fields 2 5 db it indicates that the nature of the acoustic field is no more diffuse like in reverberant field therefore the nature of the acoustic field described just above could be used to estimate the schroeder frequency by a statistical approach the main idea is to perform measurements with a particular signal composed of a broadband white noise and pure sine waves superimposed as previously evoked the spectral density of such signals is given in fig 19 the signal used in this measurement is a white noise with sine waves at frequency every 100 hz between 500 hz and 25 khz each sine wave is emerging from the background spectra composed of white noise thus for a given frequency the analysis of the distribution with a small bandwidth centred on a pure sine wave is assumed to follow a gumbel distribution as long as the given frequency is beyond the schroeder frequency if the bandwidth does not contain a pure sine wave the broadband noise used must modify the distribution and has to fit a non symmetrical normal one the difference between the two regimes could be observed in the evolution of the deviation δ l against the frequency these results are shown in fig 20 it could be observed that at low frequencies the deviation δ l is similar between the results obtained by analysing the sine signal or the noise signal the absolute value in the modal domain depends mainly on the spatial distribution of the hydrophones regarding the modal magnitude shapes and also if these modes are excited by the source position or not consequently taking into account many modes it is hard to predict theoretically the expected value of the deviation the results are nevertheless consistent between the values obtained at low frequencies however for high frequencies we observe a difference between the two deviations obtained with sine or white noise signals this expected behaviour is clearly observed on fig 20 the sine signals results are very close slightly lower to the theoretical values of 2 5 db the deviation obtained for the noise is lower than expected theoretically for a gumbel distribution and close to 0 5 db the limit between the two domains modal diffuse could be observed as already remarked by skålevik 2011 in room acoustics the transition between the two domains is gradual and not sharp enough to allow an accurate evaluation of the limit the crossover region between the two domains is also observed in our results once again the use of a given threshold seems required to compute the so called schroeder frequency nevertheless it is worth noticing that the order of magnitude of the bandwidth in which the transition occurs is the same for the two experimental processes used in this paper finally following the discussion of skålevik in his paper skålevik 2011 the transition between the modal domain and the statistical domain is progressive the schroeder frequency has been defined originally by schroeder as the frequency high enough to maintain the validity of the statistical theory it could be then defined as the higher limit of the transition region it could also be defined as the lower bound of the transition region or also as the central frequency of this area anyway the use of the schroeder frequency as an indicator of the facility behaviour for the analysis of noise measurements in a cavitation tunnel requires only an order of magnitude regarding the consistent results obtained experimentally in this paper by two different ways and also the good agreement between the theory and the experimental values we are confident enough to propose the following equations for computing the schroeder frequency in cavitation tunnels f r e c t 0 2721 e d t c 0 2 s and f c i r c 0 6511 e d t c 0 2 s 4 conclusion the description of the acoustic field in a particular environment like a cavitation tunnel is one of the key point for an accurate estimate of the underwater radiated noise the geometrical configuration of such a measurement is far to be comparable to a free field the analysis of the results obtained during an experimental campaign has to be led with the knowledge of the acoustic field features at low frequencies modal domain is suitable for high frequencies the statistical approach remains the only practicable method the concept of the so called schroeder frequency delimiting the two domains is adapted to the case of the acoustic propagation in duct for both rectangular and circular shape sections the adaptation is required mainly because the original definition used two parameters the volume of the environment and the reverberation time that appear here to be not the more appropriated parameters for defining the physical problem a new formula is then derived for the schroeder frequency and adjusted to the gth measurements with the help of a threshold found not so far from the original threshold of the dissipation rate given by schroeder and kuttruff 1962 besides several experimental data sets of transfer function have been used to describe the statistics obtained for the acoustic field it has been demonstrated that the experimental diffuse acoustic field complies very well with a gumbel distribution as predicted by the theory whereas it is more similar to a non symmetrical normal distribution in the modal domain this particularity of the acoustic field statistics has been used as another way to estimate the schroeder frequency in the test section of our cavitation tunnel it has to be emphasized that the order of magnitude of the frequencies computed by the two approaches is the same however further studies are required to assess the accuracy of the equations of the schroeder frequency derived in this paper the threshold found here is close to the one defined historically but measurements and results from other facilities should be helpful to criticize the choice made here with our data these studies could be driven in other facilities or also by a numerical way with the help of monte carlo method for example declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
21719,in high flow velocity areas turbulence intensity is high and flow variations may have a major impact on tidal turbines behaviour previous studies show that a square wall mounted cylinder produces a very extended and energetic wake in this work two component piv measurements are conducted in the symmetry plane of the flow in order to evaluate the turbulent kinetic energy tke budget this analysis enables to show how the tke produced in the shear layer region is re distributed and dissipated within the flow the large eddy piv method enables to obtain full spatial maps of dissipation and to assess the validity of the constant involved in the spectral method results show that the production occurs when the reynolds shear stress is the more intense so is the dissipation energy is then transported through turbulent motion into the outer flow and swept to the bottom due to the pressure gradient effects production is directly due to the periodic vortex shedding unlike for other terms a better description of the energy exchanges in the turbulent wake flow is obtained this knowledge is important for the performance determination of a tidal turbine positioned in such an obstacle wake which affects the flow induced dynamic load on turbine keywords turbulence experimental trials wall mounted cylinder piv ldv kinetic energy budget 1 introduction industrial projects have started to emerge in tidal energy harvesting there is a strong tidal potential in europe and over 25 of the european potential is located in french waters edf 2010 in situ strong velocity variations exist myers and bahaj 2005 the flow perturbations can come from waves inflow turbulence coast or bathymetry effects ouro and stoesser 2018 such flow variations are causing a high turbulence rate in the water column moreover due to bathymetry variations some turbulent events can sometimes rise up to the surface and erupt to create a boil as it is observed in the alderney race myers and bahaj 2005 ikhennicheu et al 2019b presented a case study comparison of various elementary obstacles used to reproduce at scale bathymetry variations they concluded that a surface mounted cylinder produces the most energetic wake that extends up to the free surface in this case large scale turbulent structures are periodically emitted from its wake and their diameter is similar to the one of a turbine at the same scale ikhennicheu et al 2019c these high energetic flow structures induce some mean velocity shear and thus a turbulent kinetic energy tke production term this work proposes a better understanding of the transportation of the turbulent kinetic energy in the wake of two dimensional obstacle related to realistic bathymetry variations the knowledge of the inflow turbulence that will potentially impact a turbine is of great interest for optimizing the turbine performance durán medina et al 2017 indeed the turbulent inflow condition plays a crucial role not only on both fatigue and mean loads acting on hydrodynamics turbine mycek et al 2014 but also on the wake evolution behind the turbine for the development of tidal turbine farms a better knowledge of the turbine wake under specific incoming turbulent flow conditions is essential to optimize the turbines location in order to know if such inflow can be critical for tidal turbines behaviour specific studies were initiated ikhennicheu et al 2019 but today a better knowledge of the flow characteristics in the cylinder wake is still needed particularly from an energetic point of view such description will allow a more thorough validation of numerical models mercier et al 2020 which will then provide precise flow data in tidal sites this work highlights how the large eddy piv approach enables us to obtain full spatial maps of dissipation and also to compare it with the spectral method and assess of the validity of the constant used for the dissipation rate estimation the description of the energy exchange in the turbulent wake flow will permit to determine the performance of a tidal turbine positioned in such an obstacle wake many studies have focused on turbulent flow over and behind a surface mounted obstacle due to its important implication in many engineering applications however only a few studies detailed the tke budget obtained in a flow configuration close to the current one these studies are given in table 1 where the nature of available data experimental or numerical and the reynolds number of the flow configuration are mentioned in this study we propose to analyse previous ldv and piv measurements ikhennicheu et al 2019 obtained in the wake of a horizontal wall mounted square cylinder this flow configuration and measurement methods have specific characteristics which greatly differ from previous investigations see table 1 first the reynolds number based on the mean upstream flow velocity and the cylinder height is equal to 2 5 1 0 5 second to fully investigate the near and far wake of the cylinder large piv measurement planes 0 5 m 2 with a high spatial discretization 1 3 cm in each direction have been used the purpose is then to determine each term of the equation of conservation of the turbulent kinetic energy hence this works proposed to perform a tke budget based on piv measurements at reynolds number much higher than existing works 10 to 100 times higher thus providing data closer to in situ conditions the determination of the turbulent dissipation rate ϵ appearing in the tke budget requires turbulent velocity gradients which cannot be entirely and accurately computed from 2d piv many studies focused on the estimation of the dissipation rate from piv measurements saarenrinne and piirto 2000 zaripov et al 2019 the remaining velocity gradients are generally estimated under isotropy assumption or other hypothesis but the piv resolution especially in our case is too large to access the dissipative smallest scales smaller than the kolmogorov scale to address this problem several methods have been developed sheng et al 2000 such as the large eddy piv method and the spectral method the former follows the same concept of large eddy simulation where the large scale flow structures are computed while the smallest ones are modelled thanks to a sub grid scale model this assumes that the turbulent kinetic production is only due to large scale structures which is true for high reynolds number turbulent flow and the turbulent energy dissipation comes from the smallest scale structures the energy transfer takes place in the inertial area determined by the properties of the flow this method relies then on the determination of a spatial filter size applied to piv measures for the separation of involved flow scales to access the spatial scale filtering process the direct energy transfer method presented in natrajan and christensen 2006 can be considered it allows a direct calculation of the energy transfer between the large scale filtered turbulence and the small scale structures conversely the spectral method is based on the local isotropy of the flow and the frozen turbulence taylor s assumption these two methods will be successively implemented in this work to access the energy dissipation rate justifying the use of ldv measurements in present investigation for the spectral method application the main objective is to characterize the spatial distribution of each term the production the turbulent transport the pressure transport the convection and the viscous dissipation in the near and far wake of the surface mounted 2d cylinder a better description of the energy exchanges in the turbulent wake flow is important for the determination of the performance of a tidal turbine positioned in such an obstacle wake which affects the flow induced dynamic load on turbine it is also of great importance for the analysis of the accuracy of the closure models used in the numerical simulation in this paper the experimental set up is first described with a presentation of the tank and the used velocimetry techniques then the average flow past the wall mounted cylinder is briefly reminded finally the decomposition of the turbulent kinetic energy budget is proposed and results for the wall mounted cylinder cases are presented 2 experimental set up the tests are carried out in the wave and current circulating flume tank of ifremer located in boulogne sur mer france presented in fig 1 a the test section is 18 m long 4 m wide 2 m high in this work the three instantaneous velocity components are denoted u v w along the x y z directions respectively fig 1 b each instantaneous velocity component is separated into a mean value and a fluctuating part according to the reynolds decomposition u u u where an overbar indicates the time average the incoming flow u v w is assumed to be steady and constant by means of a grid and a honeycomb that acts as a flow straightener placed at the inlet of the working section see fig 1 b a turbulent intensity of i 1 5 is achieved for a flow velocity of 1 m s turbulence intensity i in the incoming flow is defined as follows where σ is the standard deviation 1 i 100 1 3 σ u 2 σ v 2 σ w 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 the wall mounted cylinder case is chosen to be representative of real life conditions alderney race ikhennicheu et al 2019 as there is no obstacle upstream of the cylinder the upstream flow is a simple boundary layer developing over the tank floor hence the experimental set up represents a bump considerably higher than its neighbours to consider turbulent events interaction with the free surface experiments shall be achieved in froude similitude see table 2 where f r u g d with g the gravity and d the tank depth furthermore reynolds number must be as high as achievable to be closer to real conditions the obstacle of interest in this study is a wall mounted cylinder of aspect ratio a r width height 6 this obstacle represents a key bathymetric element in the area of interest at a 1 20 scale see table 2 in the following non dimensional lengths are used for all parameters indexed by x x h y y h z z h and δ δ h with h the cylinder height h 0 25 m at the obstacle position the boundary layer height δ equal to 1 3 is calculated as δ 95 z u 0 95 u to characterize the flow two laser velocimetry techniques are used ldv laser doppler velocimetry and piv particle image velocimetry see fig 2 beforehand the tank is seeded with 10 μ m diameter silver coated glass micro particles for the piv measurements a nd yag laser gemini like is used power is 200 mj per probe and wavelength is 532 mm the laser is synchronized with a camera flowsens eo 2m 1600 pix 1200 pix that makes double images with a time step of 1600 μ s a particle is detected on 3 to 5 pixels cross correlation peak intensity is between 0 3 and 0 8 and peak detectability ratio of the tallest correlation peak and the second tallest correlation peak adrian and westerweel 2011 is 8 in average piv acquisitions are made for 150 s hence 2250 double images are taken with a 15 h z acquisition frequency planes dimensions are 1153 430 mm 2 the data are post processed with the software dynamic studio the displacement of particles is calculated using a cross correlation on 32 pix 32 pix interrogation windows with 50 overlap meinhart et al 1993 outliers are replaced with the universal outlier detection westerweel and scarano 2005 precisions on the method can be found in ikhennicheu et al 2019c the resolution being d x d z 11 6 mm the ldv measurements are made using a 2d dantec fiberflow system the probe is positioned horizontally for u v measurements at various streamwise positions along the z axis with ldv measurements the acquisition frequency is not constant it depends on the number of particles passing through the measurement volume then a re sampling is done in the post processing based on previous works performed in the tank durán medina et al 2015 the re sampling is done using the mean sample rate of the measurement set considered at a specific streamwise position f e varies from 70 to 270 h z depending on the turbulent agitation in the water column various sources of experimental errors can be identified for both techniques they are detailed in ikhennicheu et al 2019c as both measurement methods will be used to access the fluctuating velocity field allowing the computation of each term of the tke energy budget a first comparison of ldv and piv results has been done it was demonstrated that both ldv and piv measured velocity fields are in good agreement mean flow reynolds tensor spectral content as well as the convergence of the first and second order flow statistics ikhennicheu 2019 the cylinder wake has been extensively described in ikhennicheu et al 2019c maps of average streamwise velocity component u and reynolds shear stress u w are represented in fig 3 in these figures the classical behaviour of the flow past a wall mounted element can be observed the flow separates at the leading edges of the cylinder into the outer steady region and the recirculation area downstream of the cylinder a shear layer develops in between see fig 3 b and then the flow reattaches ikhennicheu et al 2019c explained that in the symmetry plane the wake extends towards the surface due to the negligible influence of side effects the transverse component is not impacted by the cylinder wake fig 4 at x 5 5 and z 4 the values are u u 0 64 0 2 v u 0 00 0 04 et w u 0 05 0 16 hence in the symmetry plane the wake is developing in the x z plane and has a 2d aspect in the cylinder wake large scale turbulent structures are generated and they rise up in the water column fig 4 right hand side displays the spectrum of the fluctuating u component extracting at x z 2 2 it shows that these structures are shed from the cylinder at a frequency of 0 3 hz the physical description of this phenomenon presented in ikhennicheu et al 2019c allowed to validate some numerical developments performed to study high energetic sites where currents reach 5 m s mercier 2019 this study showed that even if the mean flow velocity comparisons are good the turbulent characteristics especially the energy exchanges in the flow have to be better characterized not only for numerical model improvements but also for a better understanding of the inlet flow condition that could impact a turbine 3 turbulent kinetic energy budget 3 1 description of the method for an incompressible newtonian fluid the governing equations for the fluid movements are the equations of continuity and the navier stokes equations with k 1 2 u i u i the turbulent kinetic energy hinze 1975 described the turbulent kinetic energy budget as follows

average movement to the turbulent movement d μ is the viscous diffusion that can be neglected in high reynolds number flows blackman et al 2017 ϵ is the viscous dissipation in the present study 2 components piv measurements give access to the velocity components u w under the assumption that the flow is 2d in the symmetry plane v 0 and y 0 for scales greater than the dissipation scale and that the turbulence isotropic at dissipation scale the different terms of the turbulent kinetic budget can be written as follows panigrahi et al 2008 gabriele et al 2009 3 k 3 4 u u w w 4 c u k x w k z 5 t

order centred finite difference method d μ is neglected and φ is calculated as the rest of eq 2 assuming a steady flow state k t 0 fig 4 shows that the transverse component v is relatively unaffected by the cylinder wake the velocity fluctuations at z 2 indicate a large shear stress area for u and w that does affect v at z 2 for instance values are u u 0 64 0 2 v v 0 03 0 04 and w w 0 05 0 16 as stated in the introduction part dissipation ϵ is often an issue in calculations according to the theory kolmogorov 1941 pope 2000 dissipation occurs at scale smaller than the kolmogorov scale η hence the piv resolution must be sufficient for direct ϵ calculations in our case piv measurements can only resolve scales up to the size of the interrogation window 11 6 mm hence the piv resolution is not sufficient to compute the dissipation with the direct method that issue is not applicable for other components of the turbulent kinetic energy budget as they mainly occur at larger scales various calculation methods for ϵ exist sheng et al 2000 among which le piv and et methods these methods applied to 2d piv database propose an estimation of the dissipation from resolved sub grid scale sgs both le piv and et methods are based on large eddy simulation formalism the dissipation is then evaluated using the following equations 8 ϵ ϵ s g s τ i j s i j where τ i j is the sgs stress tensor and s i j is the filtered stress tensor 9 s i j 1 2 u j x i u i x j the differences between both methods remain the evaluation of the stress tensor another class of method is the spectral method applied from temporal resolved database under several assumptions after a brief recall of these three methods they will be successively implemented to compute the tke dissipation rate spectral method the spectral method is based on the richardson kolmogorov theory kolmogorov 1941 under homogeneous isotropic turbulence hit conditions at high reynolds number the theoretical one dimensional energy spectrum in the inertial range is 10 e f c k ϵ 2 3 f 5 3 with c k c k u 2 π 5 3 with the kolmogorov constant c k equal to 1 5 pope 2000 even if the constant value remains questionable al homoud and hondzo 2007 defining the constant c k 0 satisfying 11 e f c k 0 f 5 3 and corresponding to the intersection with the zero axis of the slope in the log log representation of the spectrum in the inertial range the energy dissipation rate becomes 12 ϵ c k 0 c k 3 2 2 π u 5 2 the kolmogorov scale can then be evaluated as follows 13 η ν 3 ϵ 1 4 following previous developments ldv measurements are used to compute the velocity fluctuations spectra fig 5 displays two representative spectra of the u component which are superimposed on the f 5 3 slope in the inertial range such a representation allows the evaluation of the kolmogorov scale note that as a function of the spatial location the spectral slope exhibits various c k 0 values inducing different kolmogorov scale values the maximum value of η is equal to η 0 065 mm which is close to the 0 092 mm found in a rib wake in panigrahi et al 2008 direct energy transfer et and le piv methods both et and le piv methods rely on the les large eddy simulation formalism allowing a spatial scale filtering separation within the inertial range of the velocity spectrum details of the applications of these methods can be found in sheng et al 2000 natrajan and christensen 2006 and blackman et al 2017 consequently the direct et method uses the sgs stress tensor defined as follows 14 τ i j e t u i u j u i u j based on the available 2d piv database an estimate of the sgs dissipation is given by natrajan and christensen 2006 15 ϵ s g s 2 d τ 11 s 11 2 τ 12 s 12 τ 22 s 22 in the other hand the le piv method proposes to model the stress tensor using smagorinsky 1963 16 τ i j c s 2 δ 2 s s i j with c s 0 17 the smagorinsky constant and δ the sub grid size which corresponds to the size of the spatial filtering for isotropic turbulence and using piv results the dissipation rate can be written as khan 2005 17 ϵ c s δ 2 4 u x 2 4 w z 2 2 u z 2 2 w x 2 3 2 both methods are implemented and successively tested using several sizes for the low pass spatial filtering operation detailed below 3 2 tke budget in the cylinder wake the upstream flow is anisotropic but the turbulent agitation in the obstacles wake restores the isotropy ikhennicheu et al 2017a in the symmetry plane the cylinder wake can be considered 2d ikhennicheu et al 2019c the method described in the previous section to calculate the terms of the equation can thus be applied to the cylinder wake positive values are energy gains and negative values are energy losses in the following the dissipation rate is estimated using the le piv method before presenting each term of the tke budget a statistical convergence analysis of the third order moments as well as the convection and transport terms of the tke budget is presented fig 6 displays the following third order moments used to compute the transport term of the tke budget u 3 w 3 u 2 w u w 2 calculated from n 1 n 2 n 3 n t 1000 1500 2000 2249 time steps it is observed that available n t time steps are sufficient to obtained quasi converged third order moment values the statistical convergence is also done for the convection c and transport t terms see fig 7 even if some very slight differences appear between n 3 and n t this representation confirms that the terms appearing in the tke budget are statistically converged in order to choose and validate the value of δ the size of the spatial filtering operation we propose to determine the sub grid scale sgs dissipation using varying values of δ both et and le piv methods are used to compute the dissipation by applying similar low pass filtering to velocity fields fig 8 displays the dissipation profiles computed from et and le piv methods at x 2 using different values of δ note that the size of the spatial filtering is normalized with d x the spatial resolution of piv which is the limit size of the resolved small scales structures first et results do not seem to be satisfactory fully converged for δ 1 justifying that the profile of et method with δ d x δ 1 is not represented second a quite good agreement is observed for both methods with et dissipation values converging to le piv values for δ 1 23 based on these investigations it is proposed to keep δ 1 23 value as a good compromise for both methods fig 9 presents the distribution along the z axis of each normalized term in the tke budget equation at x 2 the wake does not reach z 4 hence no measurements were carried out higher furthermore fig 10 shows maps of production and dissipation in the very near wake globally for all quantities their magnitude is relatively higher in the near wake compared to the far wake the profiles also illustrate the shear layer rising in the water column with a decreasing intensity when moving further from the obstacle it is first confirmed that the main source of tke is the vortex shedding developing behind the cylinder a high level of the turbulent kinetic energy production p is observed inside the shear layer area the production peak occurs at the peak of the reynolds shear stress indeed reynolds shear stress is the main contribution to turbulent energy production panigrahi et al 2008 panigrahi 2009 blackman et al 2017 note that the high turbulent kinetic energy area highlighted in fig 3 extends further downstream compared to that of turbulent production p presented in fig 8 indeed in the downstream direction x 5 the magnitude of the turbulent production gradually decreases due to the dissipation of the shear layer in the agitated turbulent flow fig 10 illustrates this decrease of the production intensity when the shear layer is dissipating production p is compensated mostly by viscous dissipation ϵ at the peak turbulent transport t at the bottom and pressure transport φ at the top above the reynolds shear stress peak the dominant component is the turbulent transport t from the shear layer to the outer flow that effect is compensated by convection c and pressure transport φ convection c is higher in the near wake due to the unsteady flow separation and presents generally small magnitude with negative values the absolute value of c which corresponds to the transfer of tke via mean flow decreases in the far wake as it was previously observed panigrahi 2009 ricardo et al 2014 underneath the reynolds shear stress peak energy is mainly ejected by pressure effect hence the turbulent kinetic energy produced by the shear is transported to the outer flow by turbulent processes t and swept to the bottom by pressure gradient effects φ the turbulent transport term t is then high in the shear layer and then changes sign inside the shear layer negative in the lower region of the shear layer and positive in the upper region which is similar to previous studies panigrahi et al 2008 panigrahi 2009 liu and thomas 2004 concerning the dissipation rate ϵ the tke is dissipated within the shear layer especially in the near wake in this area the dissipation rate follows the one of the turbulent production and its magnitude is maximal in the near wake see fig 10 dissipation ϵ is thus maximal at the position where turbulence intensity is the highest liu and thomas 2004 and is correlated to the production peak that behaviour is often observed for flows past ribs panigrahi et al 2008 panigrahi 2009 unlike for turbulent boundary layers but in the far wake the dissipation rate does not seem to be directly related to the vortex shedding to investigate the link between each term and the large scale flow structures instantaneous and spectral analyses are performed in the next section globally along the symmetrical axis of the wall mounted square cylinder in a high reynolds flow tke budget terms exhibit the same tendency and amplitudes as the one presented in similar flow configurations for the flow past a wall mounted rib at lower reynolds numbers see table 1 shah and tachie 2008 acharya et al 1994 panigrahi et al 2008 a similar distribution of each tke term is observed along the shear layer moving downstream the intensities are lower and the production p close to 0 due to the wake dissipation the main components at those downstream positions are the turbulent transport t and consequently the pressure transport φ that can be caused by 3d effects instantaneous and spectral analysis of production and dissipation terms instantaneous production is represented along with the fluctuating velocity signals in fig 11 a it shows that production peaks occur when the fluctuating velocity drops when a vortex is passing indeed vortices shed in the cylinder wake present very intense negative fluctuating velocities in their bottom part and low positive velocities at the top ikhennicheu et al 2019c hence when a large scale turbulent structures passes turbulent kinetic energy is produced the production peak amplitude does not seem to be correlated to the velocity fluctuation intensity authors assume that it is due to the complex 3d organization of vortex structures a single point analysis is not enough to correlate vortices intensity to production peaks amplitude dissipation ϵ however does not follow the velocity fluctuations indeed the flow is dominated by large scale turbulent structures shed from the cylinder whereas dissipation occurs at small scales production and dissipation power spectral densities are also given in fig 11 b the production spectrum follows a 5 3 slope as for the velocity in the inertial sub range kolmogorov 1941 there is a wide peak at f 0 3 hz also present on the velocity spectra indicating the vortex shedding frequency from the cylinder ikhennicheu et al 2019c indeed the vortices being shed are large scale structures source of the production dissipation spectra does not follow the 5 3 slope and does not show any peak dissipation is thus not directly connected to the vortex shedding dominating the flow convection c and turbulent transport t signals and spectra are not depicted here results are similar to the dissipation their behaviour is not connected to the vortex shedding investigation of the spectral method for dissipation rate estimation by comparing both methods le piv and spectral using ldv data for estimating the dissipation rate it is possible to investigate the constant c k appearing in the spectral method and based on certain assumptions thus from these results we can also determine the kolmogorov constant c k generally fixed at 1 5 tennekes and lumley 1972 indeed numerous studies are questioning that value al homoud and hondzo 2007 looking to evaluate the dissipation in a undulating grid set up estimate that 0 43 c k 4 differences observed between le piv and the spectral method fig 12 can thus be explained by a c k value to be adjusted using experimental data in x 2 results from the spectral method are close to le piv for c k 1 although le piv can be used to question the c k values commonly used as this method is based on strong assumptions authors suggest that this value should be used in further works with precautions 4 conclusions and perspectives in this paper specific in situ conditions are reproduced in the ifremer flume tank at high reynolds number r e 2 5 1 0 5 large bathymetry variations are reproduced with a large aspect ratio wall mounted cylinder this obstacle produces a very energetic and extended wake embedded with large scale turbulent structures such turbulent inflow can have a strong impact on tidal turbines the wake past the wall mounted cylinder is thus investigated using piv and ldv measurements this paper focuses on the turbulent content of the cylinder wake using the decomposition of the turbulent kinetic energy budget equation different terms are identified and calculated using large scale piv measurements planes dimensions are 1153 430 mm 2 a special care is taken for the dissipation calculation as viscous dissipation occurs at small scale unlike for other terms using ldv measurements the spectral method based on the richardson kolmogorov theory is used to determine the kolmogorov scale at which viscous dissipation occurs that scale is much smaller than the piv interrogation window size hence piv measurements are not resolved enough to evaluate directly viscous dissipation consequently the large eddy piv is used based on the smagorinsky sub grid model the kinetic energy budget is performed at different streamwise positions in the cylinder wake results show that production is maximized where the average reynlods shear stress is the more intense where energy transmitted from the mean flow to the turbulent flow is maximized dissipation peak occurs at the same position in between turbulent kinetic energy is ejected to the outer flow by turbulent effects and swept to the bottom by pressure gradient effects further analysis shows that production peaks coincide with the passing of large scale turbulent structures dissipation that occurs at smaller scales does not follow that trend that decomposition allows a more thorough analysis of the turbulent wake of the cylinder however dissipation computed with the le piv is dependant on the subgrid scale and corresponds to the transfer of the tke from resolved scales to subgrid ones tke budget decomposition may be used for validation of numerical model allowing a more precise identification of any development issues it also illustrates that the evaluation of the turbulent kinetic energy budget is achievable for large scale piv planes in high reynolds number flow that type of description is useful when predicting the potential loads on a tidal turbine submitted to the wake of bathymetry elements furthermore turbulent inflow conditions play a crucial role in the wake evolution behind the turbine then the present thorough analysis of the energy exchanges is needed for the development of tidal turbine farm and specifically for the associated numerical models this paper presents the first results obtained for that study further experiments including synchronous measurements of the three velocity components or piv measurements planes of different size are necessary to confirm the hypothesis for calculating the different components of the equation even if the large eddy piv approach enabled to obtain full spatial maps of dissipation and also to compare it with the spectral method and to assess the validity of the constant used for the dissipation rate estimation the tke energy budget can also be achieved at the turbine position with or without its

21719,in high flow velocity areas turbulence intensity is high and flow variations may have a major impact on tidal turbines behaviour previous studies show that a square wall mounted cylinder produces a very extended and energetic wake in this work two component piv measurements are conducted in the symmetry plane of the flow in order to evaluate the turbulent kinetic energy tke budget this analysis enables to show how the tke produced in the shear layer region is re distributed and dissipated within the flow the large eddy piv method enables to obtain full spatial maps of dissipation and to assess the validity of the constant involved in the spectral method results show that the production occurs when the reynolds shear stress is the more intense so is the dissipation energy is then transported through turbulent motion into the outer flow and swept to the bottom due to the pressure gradient effects production is directly due to the periodic vortex shedding unlike for other terms a better description of the energy exchanges in the turbulent wake flow is obtained this knowledge is important for the performance determination of a tidal turbine positioned in such an obstacle wake which affects the flow induced dynamic load on turbine keywords turbulence experimental trials wall mounted cylinder piv ldv kinetic energy budget 1 introduction industrial projects have started to emerge in tidal energy harvesting there is a strong tidal potential in europe and over 25 of the european potential is located in french waters edf 2010 in situ strong velocity variations exist myers and bahaj 2005 the flow perturbations can come from waves inflow turbulence coast or bathymetry effects ouro and stoesser 2018 such flow variations are causing a high turbulence rate in the water column moreover due to bathymetry variations some turbulent events can sometimes rise up to the surface and erupt to create a boil as it is observed in the alderney race myers and bahaj 2005 ikhennicheu et al 2019b presented a case study comparison of various elementary obstacles used to reproduce at scale bathymetry variations they concluded that a surface mounted cylinder produces the most energetic wake that extends up to the free surface in this case large scale turbulent structures are periodically emitted from its wake and their diameter is similar to the one of a turbine at the same scale ikhennicheu et al 2019c these high energetic flow structures induce some mean velocity shear and thus a turbulent kinetic energy tke production term this work proposes a better understanding of the transportation of the turbulent kinetic energy in the wake of two dimensional obstacle related to realistic bathymetry variations the knowledge of the inflow turbulence that will potentially impact a turbine is of great interest for optimizing the turbine performance durán medina et al 2017 indeed the turbulent inflow condition plays a crucial role not only on both fatigue and mean loads acting on hydrodynamics turbine mycek et al 2014 but also on the wake evolution behind the turbine for the development of tidal turbine farms a better knowledge of the turbine wake under specific incoming turbulent flow conditions is essential to optimize the turbines location in order to know if such inflow can be critical for tidal turbines behaviour specific studies were initiated ikhennicheu et al 2019 but today a better knowledge of the flow characteristics in the cylinder wake is still needed particularly from an energetic point of view such description will allow a more thorough validation of numerical models mercier et al 2020 which will then provide precise flow data in tidal sites this work highlights how the large eddy piv approach enables us to obtain full spatial maps of dissipation and also to compare it with the spectral method and assess of the validity of the constant used for the dissipation rate estimation the description of the energy exchange in the turbulent wake flow will permit to determine the performance of a tidal turbine positioned in such an obstacle wake many studies have focused on turbulent flow over and behind a surface mounted obstacle due to its important implication in many engineering applications however only a few studies detailed the tke budget obtained in a flow configuration close to the current one these studies are given in table 1 where the nature of available data experimental or numerical and the reynolds number of the flow configuration are mentioned in this study we propose to analyse previous ldv and piv measurements ikhennicheu et al 2019 obtained in the wake of a horizontal wall mounted square cylinder this flow configuration and measurement methods have specific characteristics which greatly differ from previous investigations see table 1 first the reynolds number based on the mean upstream flow velocity and the cylinder height is equal to 2 5 1 0 5 second to fully investigate the near and far wake of the cylinder large piv measurement planes 0 5 m 2 with a high spatial discretization 1 3 cm in each direction have been used the purpose is then to determine each term of the equation of conservation of the turbulent kinetic energy hence this works proposed to perform a tke budget based on piv measurements at reynolds number much higher than existing works 10 to 100 times higher thus providing data closer to in situ conditions the determination of the turbulent dissipation rate ϵ appearing in the tke budget requires turbulent velocity gradients which cannot be entirely and accurately computed from 2d piv many studies focused on the estimation of the dissipation rate from piv measurements saarenrinne and piirto 2000 zaripov et al 2019 the remaining velocity gradients are generally estimated under isotropy assumption or other hypothesis but the piv resolution especially in our case is too large to access the dissipative smallest scales smaller than the kolmogorov scale to address this problem several methods have been developed sheng et al 2000 such as the large eddy piv method and the spectral method the former follows the same concept of large eddy simulation where the large scale flow structures are computed while the smallest ones are modelled thanks to a sub grid scale model this assumes that the turbulent kinetic production is only due to large scale structures which is true for high reynolds number turbulent flow and the turbulent energy dissipation comes from the smallest scale structures the energy transfer takes place in the inertial area determined by the properties of the flow this method relies then on the determination of a spatial filter size applied to piv measures for the separation of involved flow scales to access the spatial scale filtering process the direct energy transfer method presented in natrajan and christensen 2006 can be considered it allows a direct calculation of the energy transfer between the large scale filtered turbulence and the small scale structures conversely the spectral method is based on the local isotropy of the flow and the frozen turbulence taylor s assumption these two methods will be successively implemented in this work to access the energy dissipation rate justifying the use of ldv measurements in present investigation for the spectral method application the main objective is to characterize the spatial distribution of each term the production the turbulent transport the pressure transport the convection and the viscous dissipation in the near and far wake of the surface mounted 2d cylinder a better description of the energy exchanges in the turbulent wake flow is important for the determination of the performance of a tidal turbine positioned in such an obstacle wake which affects the flow induced dynamic load on turbine it is also of great importance for the analysis of the accuracy of the closure models used in the numerical simulation in this paper the experimental set up is first described with a presentation of the tank and the used velocimetry techniques then the average flow past the wall mounted cylinder is briefly reminded finally the decomposition of the turbulent kinetic energy budget is proposed and results for the wall mounted cylinder cases are presented 2 experimental set up the tests are carried out in the wave and current circulating flume tank of ifremer located in boulogne sur mer france presented in fig 1 a the test section is 18 m long 4 m wide 2 m high in this work the three instantaneous velocity components are denoted u v w along the x y z directions respectively fig 1 b each instantaneous velocity component is separated into a mean value and a fluctuating part according to the reynolds decomposition u u u where an overbar indicates the time average the incoming flow u v w is assumed to be steady and constant by means of a grid and a honeycomb that acts as a flow straightener placed at the inlet of the working section see fig 1 b a turbulent intensity of i 1 5 is achieved for a flow velocity of 1 m s turbulence intensity i in the incoming flow is defined as follows where σ is the standard deviation 1 i 100 1 3 σ u 2 σ v 2 σ w 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 the wall mounted cylinder case is chosen to be representative of real life conditions alderney race ikhennicheu et al 2019 as there is no obstacle upstream of the cylinder the upstream flow is a simple boundary layer developing over the tank floor hence the experimental set up represents a bump considerably higher than its neighbours to consider turbulent events interaction with the free surface experiments shall be achieved in froude similitude see table 2 where f r u g d with g the gravity and d the tank depth furthermore reynolds number must be as high as achievable to be closer to real conditions the obstacle of interest in this study is a wall mounted cylinder of aspect ratio a r width height 6 this obstacle represents a key bathymetric element in the area of interest at a 1 20 scale see table 2 in the following non dimensional lengths are used for all parameters indexed by x x h y y h z z h and δ δ h with h the cylinder height h 0 25 m at the obstacle position the boundary layer height δ equal to 1 3 is calculated as δ 95 z u 0 95 u to characterize the flow two laser velocimetry techniques are used ldv laser doppler velocimetry and piv particle image velocimetry see fig 2 beforehand the tank is seeded with 10 μ m diameter silver coated glass micro particles for the piv measurements a nd yag laser gemini like is used power is 200 mj per probe and wavelength is 532 mm the laser is synchronized with a camera flowsens eo 2m 1600 pix 1200 pix that makes double images with a time step of 1600 μ s a particle is detected on 3 to 5 pixels cross correlation peak intensity is between 0 3 and 0 8 and peak detectability ratio of the tallest correlation peak and the second tallest correlation peak adrian and westerweel 2011 is 8 in average piv acquisitions are made for 150 s hence 2250 double images are taken with a 15 h z acquisition frequency planes dimensions are 1153 430 mm 2 the data are post processed with the software dynamic studio the displacement of particles is calculated using a cross correlation on 32 pix 32 pix interrogation windows with 50 overlap meinhart et al 1993 outliers are replaced with the universal outlier detection westerweel and scarano 2005 precisions on the method can be found in ikhennicheu et al 2019c the resolution being d x d z 11 6 mm the ldv measurements are made using a 2d dantec fiberflow system the probe is positioned horizontally for u v measurements at various streamwise positions along the z axis with ldv measurements the acquisition frequency is not constant it depends on the number of particles passing through the measurement volume then a re sampling is done in the post processing based on previous works performed in the tank durán medina et al 2015 the re sampling is done using the mean sample rate of the measurement set considered at a specific streamwise position f e varies from 70 to 270 h z depending on the turbulent agitation in the water column various sources of experimental errors can be identified for both techniques they are detailed in ikhennicheu et al 2019c as both measurement methods will be used to access the fluctuating velocity field allowing the computation of each term of the tke energy budget a first comparison of ldv and piv results has been done it was demonstrated that both ldv and piv measured velocity fields are in good agreement mean flow reynolds tensor spectral content as well as the convergence of the first and second order flow statistics ikhennicheu 2019 the cylinder wake has been extensively described in ikhennicheu et al 2019c maps of average streamwise velocity component u and reynolds shear stress u w are represented in fig 3 in these figures the classical behaviour of the flow past a wall mounted element can be observed the flow separates at the leading edges of the cylinder into the outer steady region and the recirculation area downstream of the cylinder a shear layer develops in between see fig 3 b and then the flow reattaches ikhennicheu et al 2019c explained that in the symmetry plane the wake extends towards the surface due to the negligible influence of side effects the transverse component is not impacted by the cylinder wake fig 4 at x 5 5 and z 4 the values are u u 0 64 0 2 v u 0 00 0 04 et w u 0 05 0 16 hence in the symmetry plane the wake is developing in the x z plane and has a 2d aspect in the cylinder wake large scale turbulent structures are generated and they rise up in the water column fig 4 right hand side displays the spectrum of the fluctuating u component extracting at x z 2 2 it shows that these structures are shed from the cylinder at a frequency of 0 3 hz the physical description of this phenomenon presented in ikhennicheu et al 2019c allowed to validate some numerical developments performed to study high energetic sites where currents reach 5 m s mercier 2019 this study showed that even if the mean flow velocity comparisons are good the turbulent characteristics especially the energy exchanges in the flow have to be better characterized not only for numerical model improvements but also for a better understanding of the inlet flow condition that could impact a turbine 3 turbulent kinetic energy budget 3 1 description of the method for an incompressible newtonian fluid the governing equations for the fluid movements are the equations of continuity and the navier stokes equations with k 1 2 u i u i the turbulent kinetic energy hinze 1975 described the turbulent kinetic energy budget as follows

due to the particle movement φ is the energy transport due to pressure effect t is the energy transport due to the vortices movement p is the energy production or the transfer of energy from the average movement to the turbulent movement d μ is the viscous diffusion that can be neglected in high reynolds number flows blackman et al 2017 ϵ is the viscous dissipation in the present study 2 components piv measurements give access to the velocity components u w under the assumption that the flow is 2d in the symmetry plane v 0 and y 0 for scales greater than the dissipation scale and that the turbulence isotropic at dissipation scale the different terms of the turbulent kinetic budget can be written as follows panigrahi et al 2008 gabriele et al 2009 3 k 3 4 u u w w 4 c u k x w k z 5 t

order statistics and it is assumed that the local isotropy is satisfied as it was done in similar studies panigrahi 2009 in the rest of the study partial derivatives will be calculated using a second order centred finite difference method d μ is neglected and φ is calculated as the rest of eq 2 assuming a steady flow state k t 0 fig 4 shows that the transverse component v is relatively unaffected by the cylinder wake the velocity fluctuations at z 2 indicate a large shear stress area for u and w that does affect v at z 2 for instance values are u u 0 64 0 2 v v 0 03 0 04 and w w 0 05 0 16 as stated in the introduction part dissipation ϵ is often an issue in calculations according to the theory kolmogorov 1941 pope 2000 dissipation occurs at scale smaller than the kolmogorov scale η hence the piv resolution must be sufficient for direct ϵ calculations in our case piv measurements can only resolve scales up to the size of the interrogation window 11 6 mm hence the piv resolution is not sufficient to compute the dissipation with the direct method that issue is not applicable for other components of the turbulent kinetic energy budget as they mainly occur at larger scales various calculation methods for ϵ exist sheng et al 2000 among which le piv and et methods these methods applied to 2d piv database propose an estimation of the dissipation from resolved sub grid scale sgs both le piv and et methods are based on large eddy simulation formalism the dissipation is then evaluated using the following equations 8 ϵ ϵ s g s τ i j s i j where τ i j is the sgs stress tensor and s i j is the filtered stress tensor 9 s i j 1 2 u j x i u i x j the differences between both methods remain the evaluation of the stress tensor another class of method is the spectral method applied from temporal resolved database under several assumptions after a brief recall of these three methods they will be successively implemented to compute the tke dissipation rate spectral method the spectral method is based on the richardson kolmogorov theory kolmogorov 1941 under homogeneous isotropic turbulence hit conditions at high reynolds number the theoretical one dimensional energy spectrum in the inertial range is 10 e f c k ϵ 2 3 f 5 3 with c k c k u 2 π 5 3 with the kolmogorov constant c k equal to 1 5 pope 2000 even if the constant value remains questionable al homoud and hondzo 2007 defining the constant c k 0 satisfying 11 e f c k 0 f 5 3 and corresponding to the intersection with the zero axis of the slope in the log log representation of the spectrum in the inertial range the energy dissipation rate becomes 12 ϵ c k 0 c k 3 2 2 π u 5 2 the kolmogorov scale can then be evaluated as follows 13 η ν 3 ϵ 1 4 following previous developments ldv measurements are used to compute the velocity fluctuations spectra fig 5 displays two representative spectra of the u component which are superimposed on the f 5 3 slope in the inertial range such a representation allows the evaluation of the kolmogorov scale note that as a function of the spatial location the spectral slope exhibits various c k 0 values inducing different kolmogorov scale values the maximum value of η is equal to η 0 065 mm which is close to the 0 092 mm found in a rib wake in panigrahi et al 2008 direct energy transfer et and le piv methods both et and le piv methods rely on the les large eddy simulation formalism allowing a spatial scale filtering separation within the inertial range of the velocity spectrum details of the applications of these methods can be found in sheng et al 2000 natrajan and christensen 2006 and blackman et al 2017 consequently the direct et method uses the sgs stress tensor defined as follows 14 τ i j e t u i u j u i u j based on the available 2d piv database an estimate of the sgs dissipation is given by natrajan and christensen 2006 15 ϵ s g s 2 d τ 11 s 11 2 τ 12 s 12 τ 22 s 22 in the other hand the le piv method proposes to model the stress tensor using smagorinsky 1963 16 τ i j c s 2 δ 2 s s i j with c s 0 17 the smagorinsky constant and δ the sub grid size which corresponds to the size of the spatial filtering for isotropic turbulence and using piv results the dissipation rate can be written as khan 2005 17 ϵ c s δ 2 4 u x 2 4 w z 2 2 u z 2 2 w x 2 3 2 both methods are implemented and successively tested using several sizes for the low pass spatial filtering operation detailed below 3 2 tke budget in the cylinder wake the upstream flow is anisotropic but the turbulent agitation in the obstacles wake restores the isotropy ikhennicheu et al 2017a in the symmetry plane the cylinder wake can be considered 2d ikhennicheu et al 2019c the method described in the previous section to calculate the terms of the equation can thus be applied to the cylinder wake positive values are energy gains and negative values are energy losses in the following the dissipation rate is estimated using the le piv method before presenting each term of the tke budget a statistical convergence analysis of the third order moments as well as the convection and transport terms of the tke budget is presented fig 6 displays the following third order moments used to compute the transport term of the tke budget u 3 w 3 u 2 w u w 2 calculated from n 1 n 2 n 3 n t 1000 1500 2000 2249 time steps it is observed that available n t time steps are sufficient to obtained quasi converged third order moment values the statistical convergence is also done for the convection c and transport t terms see fig 7 even if some very slight differences appear between n 3 and n t this representation confirms that the terms appearing in the tke budget are statistically converged in order to choose and validate the value of δ the size of the spatial filtering operation we propose to determine the sub grid scale sgs dissipation using varying values of δ both et and le piv methods are used to compute the dissipation by applying similar low pass filtering to velocity fields fig 8 displays the dissipation profiles computed from et and le piv methods at x 2 using different values of δ note that the size of the spatial filtering is normalized with d x the spatial resolution of piv which is the limit size of the resolved small scales structures first et results do not seem to be satisfactory fully converged for δ 1 justifying that the profile of et method with δ d x δ 1 is not represented second a quite good agreement is observed for both methods with et dissipation values converging to le piv values for δ 1 23 based on these investigations it is proposed to keep δ 1 23 value as a good compromise for both methods fig 9 presents the distribution along the z axis of each normalized term in the tke budget equation at x 2 the wake does not reach z 4 hence no measurements were carried out higher furthermore fig 10 shows maps of production and dissipation in the very near wake globally for all quantities their magnitude is relatively higher in the near wake compared to the far wake the profiles also illustrate the shear layer rising in the water column with a decreasing intensity when moving further from the obstacle it is first confirmed that the main source of tke is the vortex shedding developing behind the cylinder a high level of the turbulent kinetic energy production p is observed inside the shear layer area the production peak occurs at the peak of the reynolds shear stress indeed reynolds shear stress is the main contribution to turbulent energy production panigrahi et al 2008 panigrahi 2009 blackman et al 2017 note that the high turbulent kinetic energy area highlighted in fig 3 extends further downstream compared to that of turbulent production p presented in fig 8 indeed in the downstream direction x 5 the magnitude of the turbulent production gradually decreases due to the dissipation of the shear layer in the agitated turbulent flow fig 10 illustrates this decrease of the production intensity when the shear layer is dissipating production p is compensated mostly by viscous dissipation ϵ at the peak turbulent transport t at the bottom and pressure transport φ at the top above the reynolds shear stress peak the dominant component is the turbulent transport t from the shear layer to the outer flow that effect is compensated by convection c and pressure transport φ convection c is higher in the near wake due to the unsteady flow separation and presents generally small magnitude with negative values the absolute value of c which corresponds to the transfer of tke via mean flow decreases in the far wake as it was previously observed panigrahi 2009 ricardo et al 2014 underneath the reynolds shear stress peak energy is mainly ejected by pressure effect hence the turbulent kinetic energy produced by the shear is transported to the outer flow by turbulent processes t and swept to the bottom by pressure gradient effects φ the turbulent transport term t is then high in the shear layer and then changes sign inside the shear layer negative in the lower region of the shear layer and positive in the upper region which is similar to previous studies panigrahi et al 2008 panigrahi 2009 liu and thomas 2004 concerning the dissipation rate ϵ the tke is dissipated within the shear layer especially in the near wake in this area the dissipation rate follows the one of the turbulent production and its magnitude is maximal in the near wake see fig 10 dissipation ϵ is thus maximal at the position where turbulence intensity is the highest liu and thomas 2004 and is correlated to the production peak that behaviour is often observed for flows past ribs panigrahi et al 2008 panigrahi 2009 unlike for turbulent boundary layers but in the far wake the dissipation rate does not seem to be directly related to the vortex shedding to investigate the link between each term and the large scale flow structures instantaneous and spectral analyses are performed in the next section globally along the symmetrical axis of the wall mounted square cylinder in a high reynolds flow tke budget terms exhibit the same tendency and amplitudes as the one presented in similar flow configurations for the flow past a wall mounted rib at lower reynolds numbers see table 1 shah and tachie 2008 acharya et al 1994 panigrahi et al 2008 a similar distribution of each tke term is observed along the shear layer moving downstream the intensities are lower and the production p close to 0 due to the wake dissipation the main components at those downstream positions are the turbulent transport t and consequently the pressure transport φ that can be caused by 3d effects instantaneous and spectral analysis of production and dissipation terms instantaneous production is represented along with the fluctuating velocity signals in fig 11 a it shows that production peaks occur when the fluctuating velocity drops when a vortex is passing indeed vortices shed in the cylinder wake present very intense negative fluctuating velocities in their bottom part and low positive velocities at the top ikhennicheu et al 2019c hence when a large scale turbulent structures passes turbulent kinetic energy is produced the production peak amplitude does not seem to be correlated to the velocity fluctuation intensity authors assume that it is due to the complex 3d organization of vortex structures a single point analysis is not enough to correlate vortices intensity to production peaks amplitude dissipation ϵ however does not follow the velocity fluctuations indeed the flow is dominated by large scale turbulent structures shed from the cylinder whereas dissipation occurs at small scales production and dissipation power spectral densities are also given in fig 11 b the production spectrum follows a 5 3 slope as for the velocity in the inertial sub range kolmogorov 1941 there is a wide peak at f 0 3 hz also present on the velocity spectra indicating the vortex shedding frequency from the cylinder ikhennicheu et al 2019c indeed the vortices being shed are large scale structures source of the production dissipation spectra does not follow the 5 3 slope and does not show any peak dissipation is thus not directly connected to the vortex shedding dominating the flow convection c and turbulent transport t signals and spectra are not depicted here results are similar to the dissipation their behaviour is not connected to the vortex shedding investigation of the spectral method for dissipation rate estimation by comparing both methods le piv and spectral using ldv data for estimating the dissipation rate it is possible to investigate the constant c k appearing in the spectral method and based on certain assumptions thus from these results we can also determine the kolmogorov constant c k generally fixed at 1 5 tennekes and lumley 1972 indeed numerous studies are questioning that value al homoud and hondzo 2007 looking to evaluate the dissipation in a undulating grid set up estimate that 0 43 c k 4 differences observed between le piv and the spectral method fig 12 can thus be explained by a c k value to be adjusted using experimental data in x 2 results from the spectral method are close to le piv for c k 1 although le piv can be used to question the c k values commonly used as this method is based on strong assumptions authors suggest that this value should be used in further works with precautions 4 conclusions and perspectives in this paper specific in situ conditions are reproduced in the ifremer flume tank at high reynolds number r e 2 5 1 0 5 large bathymetry variations are reproduced with a large aspect ratio wall mounted cylinder this obstacle produces a very energetic and extended wake embedded with large scale turbulent structures such turbulent inflow can have a strong impact on tidal turbines the wake past the wall mounted cylinder is thus investigated using piv and ldv measurements this paper focuses on the turbulent content of the cylinder wake using the decomposition of the turbulent kinetic energy budget equation different terms are identified and calculated using large scale piv measurements planes dimensions are 1153 430 mm 2 a special care is taken for the dissipation calculation as viscous dissipation occurs at small scale unlike for other terms using ldv measurements the spectral method based on the richardson kolmogorov theory is used to determine the kolmogorov scale at which viscous dissipation occurs that scale is much smaller than the piv interrogation window size hence piv measurements are not resolved enough to evaluate directly viscous dissipation consequently the large eddy piv is used based on the smagorinsky sub grid model the kinetic energy budget is performed at different streamwise positions in the cylinder wake results show that production is maximized where the average reynlods shear stress is the more intense where energy transmitted from the mean flow to the turbulent flow is maximized dissipation peak occurs at the same position in between turbulent kinetic energy is ejected to the outer flow by turbulent effects and swept to the bottom by pressure gradient effects further analysis shows that production peaks coincide with the passing of large scale turbulent structures dissipation that occurs at smaller scales does not follow that trend that decomposition allows a more thorough analysis of the turbulent wake of the cylinder however dissipation computed with the le piv is dependant on the subgrid scale and corresponds to the transfer of the tke from resolved scales to subgrid ones tke budget decomposition may be used for validation of numerical model allowing a more precise identification of any development issues it also illustrates that the evaluation of the turbulent kinetic energy budget is achievable for large scale piv planes in high reynolds number flow that type of description is useful when predicting the potential loads on a tidal turbine submitted to the wake of bathymetry elements furthermore turbulent inflow conditions play a crucial role in the wake evolution behind the turbine then the present thorough analysis of the energy exchanges is needed for the development of tidal turbine farm and specifically for the associated numerical models this paper presents the first results obtained for that study further experiments including synchronous measurements of the three velocity components or piv measurements planes of different size are necessary to confirm the hypothesis for calculating the different components of the equation even if the large eddy piv approach enabled to obtain full spatial maps of dissipation and also to compare it with the spectral method and to assess the validity of the constant used for the dissipation rate estimation the tke energy budget can also be achieved at the turbine position with or without its presence in order to understand the complex interactions between the turbulent flow and the turbine behaviour credit authorship contribution statement maria ikhennicheu investigation software writing
