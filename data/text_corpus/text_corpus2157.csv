32 6 kg n ha 1 when the n fertilizer rate was reduced from 231 kg n ha 1 to 155 kg n ha 1 and the snr was changed from 5 3 1 to 1 1 4 therefore reducing the n fertilizer rate and increasing the snr in

oryza sativa l is a major cereal crop that supports more than half of the world s population khush 2005 the rice cultivated area of china has recently reached 30 45 million ha and grain yield production is over 200 million tons which accounts for 19 of the world s total rice planted area and 25 of global rice yield fao 2017 nitrogen n fertilizer plays an important role in rice cultivation rice crops in china consumed about 37 of the total n fertilizer used for rice production in the world peng et al 2002 however only 30 40 of the n fertilizer is used by the crop while approximately 50 of n applied is lost to the environment by ammonia volatilization denitrification runoff and leaching zhu and chen 2002 this situation results in a series of serious environmental problems such as soil acidification guo 2010a groundwater pollution zhang et al 2017 water eutrophication zhao et al 2014 2016 and air pollution pappa et al 2011 li et al 2018b wang et al 2018 2019 to improve n use efficiency nue and reduce environmental pollution caused by excessive n fertilizer application the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of china recently proposed the implementation of zero increase in fertilizer use excessive n fertilizer application not only failed to achieve high yield but also led to a serious loss of n in rice production yan et al 2009 reported that there was no significant increase in rice yield when n inputs exceeded 150 kg n ha 1 wang et al 2019 demonstrated that n application primarily affected n loss to the environment but had little effect on rice yield at n rates above 130 to 170 kg n ha 1 reducing the total n application rate is an effective method to reduce n loss and improve nue in paddy fields zhang et al 2018b found that decreasing the n application rate effectively reduces n loss for instance the amount of n loss was reduced by 21 45 when the n fertilizer rate reduced from 74 8 112 3 kg n ha 1 to 59 1 70 4 kg n ha 1 zhang et al 2017 investigated n leaching for different n levels in a rice wheat rotation system and found that the total n leaching of a reduced n strategy was 30 87 lower than that of the conventional practice and crop yield increased by 23 56 zhao et al 2016 recommended that 100 kg n ha 1 organic fertilizer combined with 150 kg n ha 1 chemical fertilizer in shanghai effectively reduced n loss from runoff and leaching in paddy fields while maintaining high yield implementing a split n application ratio snr according to the rice requirement at different stages is another way to improve nue and reduce n loss yang et al 2013 emphasized that site specific n management remarkably decreased n loss through ammonia volatilization runoff and leaching liu et al 2019 examined the responses of yield and nue to different n fertilizer managements in the philippines and found that increasing the n fertilizer rate at the heading stage increases rice yield by 6 7 and improve nue prasad and mailapalli 2018 suggested that four n splits at basal tillering panicle initiation and heading stages could reduce nitrate leaching in paddy fields liu et al 2018 reported that under the n application rate of 300 kg n ha 1 the snr in the ratio of 1 1 3 of basal tiller and panicle growth stages in taihu lake could effectively reduce the n loss by surface runoff in paddy fields however these studies mainly focused on reducing n loss and improving nue under improved n management few studies have considered the relationships between n losses and different n managements strategies quantifying n loss under different n fertilizer management strategies is critical for reducing environmental impacts most studies about n losses under different n managements strategies were mainly based on field experiments however the field dynamic observation of n leaching denitrification and other n losses are time consuming and costly to overcome this shortcoming soil crop system models such as ceres rice oryza hydrus 1d and dndc have been used to simulate rice growth and n losses in paddy fields under different water and n management and environmental conditions for example zhao et al 2014 used the dndc model to simulate surface runoff and subsurface n leaching in paddy fields in shanghai li et al 2015a 2018b used the hydrus 1d model to simulate the n loss under different water and n managements in direct seeding and transplant rice fields in taihu lake tan et al 2015 investigated the effects of alternating wet and dry irrigation on water drainage and n leaching in paddy fields by using the hydrus 1d model antonopoulos 2010 used the ricewnb model to simulate rice growth water balance and n fates in paddy fields zhang et al 2018a used the ceres rice model to simulate rice growth under different climatic scenarios and latitudes hameed et al 2019 used the oryza v3 model to optimize water and n management practices to improve crop yield and nue in rice paddy however different models have their strength and weaknesses the hydrus 1d model has been widely used to simulate the water movement and solute transport but it failed to simulate the crop growth due to lack of crop module the oryza and ceres rice models can simulate crop growth process very well but the effect of n stress on rice growth is limited the dndc model used a generalized crop growth curve to simulate crop growth so the effects of climate on crop growth and its interactions with soil biogeochemical processes are not considered recently an integrated soil crop model whcns soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator was developed based on the chinese climate soil types and field management to optimize water and n management liang et al 2016a the model has been successfully applied to simulate water use n loss and water and n use efficiencies under ground cover rice production system in the middle reaches of the yangtze river liang et al 2019 at present studies on n fertilizer application in paddy fields are mainly focused on assessing the effects of n fertilizer rates on crop yield and n loss few studies had evaluated the effects of different snr under the same n fertilizer rate on crop yield and n losses in paddy fields therefore the objectives of this study are to i analyze the water consumption and n losses under the conventional farmer s practice and identify the main pathways of n losses in the middle reaches of the yangtze river and ii determine the relationships between different n fertilizer rates and snrs and crop yield and n losses in rice fields and identify an optimal n application strategy for this region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experiment design a field experiment was conducted at the jingzhou agricultural meteorological experiment station 30 21 n 112 09 e in the middle reaches of the yangtze river in jingzhou city hubei province china the study area has a humid monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 16 c an average annual rainfall of 1095 mm and a groundwater depth of approximately 90 cm a rice rapeseed rotation was planted for the last 10 years the field experiment began in may 2017 and ended in september 2018 thereby including two rice growing seasons in 2017 and 2018 rice oryza sativa l cv fengliangyou xiang no 1 indica was transplanted on june 6 and 9 with density of 9 plants m 2 and harvested on september 14 and september 18 respectively the plot area was 150 m2 25 m 6 m with three replicates according to local farmers practices an n fertilizer rate of 230 9 kg n ha 1 was applied along with 26 7 kg p ha 1 phosphate and 40 4 kg k ha 1 potassium basal fertilizer bf was incorporated using a compound mixture of urea and ammonium sulfate before transplanting topdressings of n were applied at the tillering tf1 and heading stages tf2 and the snr was applied in a ratio of 5 3 1 water management in each plot was flooding midseason drainage frequent water logging with intermittent irrigation fu et al 2019 table 1 shows the detailed field management before starting the experiment soil samples were collected by using a steel ring at depths of 0 20 20 30 and 30 90 cm to determine the soil bulk density and particle fraction which were used to estimate the hydraulic parameters by a pedotransfer function model using the rosetta software schaap 1999 table 2 the soil ph soil organic carbon soc and total n content in the topsoil were 8 1 7 9 g kg 1 and 1 2 g kg 1 respectively the soil was classified as hydragric anthrosol according to the world reference base for soil resources iuss working group wrb 2006 table 2 shows the soil physical properties e g bulk density soil hydraulic parameter and texture in the soil profile 2 2 observations and measurement methods the depth of the ponding water was manually measured every two hours during the daytime by a ruler fixed in the field and its average value at night was estimated by linear interpolation between observations the irrigation amount was manually recorded using a water meter the runoff pools were installed for three plots before the experiment the runoff water depth was collected to calculate the runoff volume for every event and the concentration of nh4 n and no3 n in the water samples were determined by using a flow analyzer auto analyzer 3 bran luebbe germany the amount of n runoff during the rice growing season was calculated by 1 n r i l n r i c i where nr was the amount of n loss through runoff kg n ha 1 ri was the runoff amount occurring in the ith event mm and ci represented the concentration of soil inorganic n in the runoff water mg l 1 ammonia volatilization was measured by the dynamic box method in 2017 the ammonia collection device consisted of a closed cover a snorkel a gas wash bottle and a vacuum pump the gas wash bottle was filled with 60 ml of 20 g l 1 boric acid h3bo3 solution to collect nh3 from rice fields after the application of bf and the first topdressing tf1 nh3 flux was measured every 2 h in the daytime from june 6 to july 1 respectively during the midseason drainage period and after the second topdressing tf2 nh3 flux measurements were reduced to twice a day from july 2 to 17 from the second topdressing until harvest july 18 to sept 14 the frequency was reduced to four times a week zhan et al 2019 due to lack of workers the n losses by runoff and ammonia volatilization were not measured in 2018 aboveground dry matter was measured at middle and maximum tillering panicle initiation flowering and maturity on each sampling date eight hills were harvested and dried at 70 c to a constant weight exactly 1 m2 of undisturbed area in the center of each plot was harvested for determining grain yield and straw dry yield when the crop was mature after each plant sample was taken the total n content of the plants was determined using a c and n element analyzer flash2000 thermo usa the weather data at the experimental site rainfall air temperature relatively humidity solar radiation and wind speed were collected every 30 min using an automatic weather station the latent and sensible heat fluxes were observed at the 2 m height at 30 min intervals using an eddy covariance system li7500 li cor usa and soil heat flux was also measured at the 10 cm soil depth at 30 min intervals hfp01 campbell usa evapotranspiration et was directly measured using the eddy covariance system the energy balance equation was used to calculate some missing et values due to equipment malfunction by 2 n r g h λ e t where nr is net radiation mj m 2 day 1 h is the sensible heat g is soil

study liang et al 2016a the model runs on a daily time step and is driven by meteorological data and crop physiology parameters it can be used to simulate crop growth soil water movement n transport and transformation and heat transfer the model uses the penman monteith method to estimate the reference crop et allen et al 1998 the soil water infiltration and redistribution process under unsaturated conditions is computed by the green ampt model and richards equation hachum and alfaro 1980 darcy s law is used to compute soil water flow under saturated condition the daily surface water depth is estimated by using the water balance equation 3 p w n p w n 1 i n p n e t n r n i n f n where pwn and pwn 1 represent the ponding water depth mm on day n and n 1 day respectively in is the irrigation amount mm d 1 pn is the precipitation mm d 1 and etn is the evapotranspiration on day n mm d 1 rn represents the runoff on day n mm d 1 and infn is the water infiltration flux on day n mm d 1 for paddy fields the maximum ponding water depth equals the height of the field ridge in the case of heavy precipitation the pool must be filled first and runoff occurs after the water exceeds the field ridge soil c and n cycling concepts were directly taken from the daisy model hansen et al 2012 the soil n transport process is described by the convection dispersion equation and the key processes such as net mineralization urea hydrolysis ammonia volatilization nitrification denitrification and crop uptake are included in the sink source terms the general ps123 crop model is used to simulate annual crop growth processes including crop development stage lai photosynthate accumulation and allocation maintenance and growth respiration and crop yield formation driessen and konjin 1992 the daily water stress factor is computed by dividing the actual evaporation by the potential evaporation the n stress ns factor was derived based on the simulation of the crop n demand actual crop n uptake and soil n supply more detailed information is available in liang et al 2016a the whcns model has been successfully used to simulate various crops such as wheat corn rice and vegetables in the north china plain and south and northwest china li et al 2015b liang et al 2016b 2017 2018 shi et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 2 4 scenario analysis the whcns model was used to simulate the crop yield and n fates under different n management practices and two scenarios were evaluated based on farmers practice in 2017 to obtain the optimal n fertilizer strategy for the study region in the first scenario set1 11 different n fertilizer rates were simulated at 10 intervals from 70 to 30 of the farmers practice 231 kg n ha 1 the minimum rate was 69 kg n ha 1 and the maximum rate was 300 kg n ha 1 the method and date of irrigation and fertilizer application were all consistent with the farmer s practice table1 in the second scenario set2 four additional scenarios representing different snrs based on the snr 5 3 1 of the current farmers practice were 3 4 3 1 1 2 1 1 4 and 1 1 6 in each of the snr scenarios 11 different n fertilizer rates in set1 were combined with each snr scenario in set2 giving a total of 55 11 5 different n fertilizer management scenarios for evaluation these scenarios were conducted by only varying the n application strategy of set1 or set2 while other field management practices were maintained the same as the farmer s practice in 2017 2 5 model evaluation statistics three statistical indices including root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and index of agreement d were used to evaluate the model performance willmott 1982 the three deviation statistics were calculated using the following equations 4 r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 5 d 1 i l n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o p i o 2 6 n s e 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where pi and oi are the simulated and measured values o is the mean of the measured values and n is the number of values the rmse represents the absolute error between measured and simulated values the d statistic is a descriptive measure of model fit and ranges from 0 to 1 the closer the value to 1 the better the model performance nse ranges between and 1 and allows for negative error values of d 0 75 and nse 0 is the minimum threshold values for crop growth values of d 0 60 and nse 1 is the minimum threshold values for soil outputs evaluation yang et al 2014 3 results 3 1 model calibration and evaluation before the model calibration the morris method was used to analyze the global sensitivities of input parameters soil hydraulic parameters crop parameters and n turnover parameters of the whcns model then according to the sensitivity analysis results the trial and error method was used to calibrate the model highly sensitive parameters were chosen to calibrate the model to minimize error between simulated and measured values in 2017 including ponding water depth et dry matter weight yield crop n uptake ammonium volatilization and n runoff after the calibration the input parameters were all fixed and the model was evaluated using the measured data in 2018 figs 1 3 showed the calibration and evaluation results the simulated ponding water depth et dry matter and crop n uptake were in good agreement with the measured values the maximum ponding water depth was 50 mm in 2017 and 90 mm in 2018 fig 1 the average ponding water depth in 2018 was higher than that in 2017 the difference in et was small for two years fig 2 the dry matter in 2017 was higher than that in 2018 fig 3a the reason was that the seedlings transplanted in 2018 were later than in 2017 thereby causing delay of a few days later for the rice development in 2018 the simulated crop n uptake in 2017 was higher than in 2018 because of the higher dry matter values in 2017 fig 3b from the middle to the late periods of rice growth simulated crop n uptake for two years were higher than the measured values because we ignored the root n uptake in the measurement the differences between the simulated and measured yield in 2017 and 2018 were 2 and 980 kg ha 1 respectively table 4 giving a simulation error of less than 10 which was within an acceptable range for runoff the simulation error was 42 and 4 mm for the two years respectively the differences between simulated and measured ammonia volatilization and n runoff in 2017 were 1 1 and 0 7 kg n ha 1 respectively and their differences were both small table 3 showed the evaluation statistic of model performance for the model calibration the rmse values of the ponding water depth et adm and crop n uptake in 2017 were 16 03 mm 1 44 mm 414 kg ha 1 and 15 02 kg n ha 1 respectively the evaluation indices of d and nse were 0 93 except for the depth of the ponding water in 2017 the d 0 77 and nse 0 38 values for the ponding water depth were relatively low mainly because of the large difference between the simulated and measured values at 15 27 days after transplanting only a small amount of rainfall was observed on the 22nd and 23rd day during this period and the difference may be caused by measurement errors of ponding water depth during that period for model evaluation the rmse values of ponding water depth et adm and crop n uptake in 2018 were 15 74 mm 1 18 mm 375 kg ha 1 and 16 89 kg n ha 1 respectively except for ponding water depth nse value of 0 70 the values of d and nse for other observed values were 0 92 the values of all the evaluation indices for two years were within the acceptable range and good agreement was observed between the simulated and measured values therefore the model gave good performance and can be used to simulate rice growth water movement and n fates in the study area 3 2 water consumption and n fates table 4 showed the simulated results of water consumption and n fates in the 0 90 cm soil profile during the rice growth season for both years the rainfall in the rice growth season in 2017 was 100 mm higher than that in 2018 and the irrigation amount in 2018 was 100 mm more than that in 2017 thus the amount of water inputs precipitation irrigation for both years was almost the same drainage was the main component of water loss accounting for 44 and 49 of the water input in 2017 and 2018 respectively the et in 2018 was higher than that in 2017 in contrast with 2017 the average temperature in 2018 was higher thereby leading to a relatively larger soil evaporation however its effect on transpiration was limited and the transpiration between the two years was not obvious the amount of runoff among the water outputs was the smallest in 2017 the amount of runoff was approximately twice that in 2018 the wue was higher in 2017 than 2018 because of the higher et in 2018 from the n balance table 4 n input fertilization net mineralization n irrigation wet deposition was almost the same for both years approximately 307 kg n ha 1 crop n uptake was the largest n output approximately 190 kg n ha 1 accounting for 64 4 of the total n output gaseous n loss surface runoff and n leaching were the main pathways for n loss in the paddy field gaseous loss ammonia volatilization denitrification was obviously higher than those by water body loss runoff leaching the two year average of denitrification ammonia volatilization n leaching and runoff loss accounted for 17 16 10 and 3 of the n fertilizer rate respectively the amount of n loss by denitrification was the highest because of the long term flooding conditions during the rice growing season the second largest loss was ammonia volatilization because of the two topdressings which were directly applied to the surface water the simulated n leaching in 2017 and 2018 were 25 3 and 22 5 kg n ha 1 respectively n loss by runoff was the smallest among all n losses components which was mainly determined by the n concentration in the surface water the nue was lower in 2017 than in 2018 due to the slightly higher yield in 2018 however the difference in the total amount of n loss for both years was not obvious table 4 3 3 crop yield and n fates under different n fertilization scenarios 3 3 1 effects of different n fertilizer rates on crop yield and n fates a large amount of n was lost to the environment under the farmers practice according to the model simulation results the average amount of total n loss by ammonia volatilization denitrification runoff and leaching was approximately 105 kg n ha 1 for both years accounting for 35 6 of the total n output table 4 the validated model was used to simulate the crop yield and n fates under different n fertilizer rates to improve nue and reduce n losses in paddy fields based on the farmers practice in 2017 fig 4 a and b showed that the simulated yield and n uptake increased linearly with the n fertilizer rate when the n fertilizer rate exceeded 198 kg n ha 1 the yield and n uptake reached the maximum and no obvious change was observed in crop yield and n uptake as the n application rate increased the relationship between crop yield and n uptake and n fertilizer rate could be described by a linear plus platform model however various n loss pathways obviously increased with the n fertilizer rate for the gaseous n loss fig 4c the amount of ammonia volatilization exponentially increased with n fertilizer rate whereas the increased rate of denitrification gradually reduced under higher n application rates this phenomenon could be described by a parabolic equation for the n loss from the pond fig 4d the amount of n runoff exponentially increased with n fertilizer rate n leaching increased until an n rate of approximately 200 kg n ha 1 then decreased with an increase in n fertilizer rate the reason may be that the proportion of ammonia volatilization denitrification and runoff loss from surface water obviously increased at the higher n fertilizer rates thereby decreasing n leaching in summary when n fertilizer rate exceeded 198 kg n ha 1 total n loss sharply increased while yield remained constant 3 3 2 effects of different snrs on crop yield and n fates the aforementioned results showed that the best n fertilizer rate was 198 kg n ha 1 when only the crop yield and n uptake were considered at this rate n loss by ammonia volatilization denitrification leaching and runoff were 28 6 37 2 25 2 and 5 9 kg n ha 1 respectively fig 4 a large amount of n 97 kg n ha 1 was still lost to the environment however optimizing the fertilization rate further was necessary to reduce environmental impacts fig 5 showed the dynamic changes of n loss during the rice growing season when the n fertilizer rate was 198 kg n ha 1 the ammonia volatilization denitrification leaching and runoff losses accounted for 98 58 22 and 81 of the total n loss within 50 days after transplanting the high levels of n fertilization in the early season caused a large amount of ammonia volatilization and n runoff loss the fluctuation of denitrification was small because the rice mostly grew under flooded condition n leaching loss mainly occurred in the late stage of rice growth due to frequent irrigation fig 6 showed the simulated nitrogen stress ns factor in each crop growing season when n fertilizer rate was 198 kg n ha 1 when the ns was zero the n supply was sufficient to meet crop demand high values of ns corresponded to severe ns ns began at approximately 65 days after transplanting and gradually increased the arrows represented the fertilizer application date in 2017 and 2018 farmers usually applied a large amount of fertilizer in the early stage of crop growth and in this experiment only a small amount was applied by topdressing for both years the two bf applications accounted for 57 of the total n applied with the first bf accouting for 34 and the 2nd bf accounting for 9 of the total n applied this resulted in a simulated n deficiency in the late stages of crop growth which may have impacted yield reducing the amount of fertilizer applied in the early stage and increasing the amount in the middle and late stages of rice growth are important to further reduce the amount of n loss four different snrs were evaluated and model simulations were performed on the basis of the ratio of farmers snr 5 3 1 fig 7 showed the yield and n fates under different n split application strategies the relationships between crop yield and crop n uptake and n fertilizer rate could be described by linear plus platform model under different snrs fig 7a b when the snrs were 3 4 3 1 1 2 1 1 4 and 1 1 6 their corresponding n fertilizer rates at the peak were 185 173 155 and 150 kg n ha 1 respectively thereby showing a gradually reducing trend however the difference in yield and crop n uptake at peak between the two ratios of 1 1 4 and 1 1 6 was not obvious therefore optimal n fertilizer rate could further improve yield and nue large differences were observed for each component of n loss among the five snrs fig 7 the amount of ammonia volatilization gradually increased with n fertilizer rates fig 7c topdressing was applied by surface application and the temperature in the late season was higher than in the early growing season thus the increase in topdressing n rate increased ammonia volatilization denitrification generally increased with increasing n rate reached a peak then decreased with higher application rates fig 7d when n fertilizer rate was low the amount of denitrification increased with the proportion of n applied in the later application after the application rate exceeds about 160 kg n ha 1 the snrs of 1 1 4 and 1 1 6 showed a decreasing trend which was lower than the three other snrs the amount of n runoff loss increased with the proportion of n fertilizer application in the late stage of rice growth mainly because a large amount of runoff occurred in the late rice season fig 7e however n runoff of the 5 3 1 snr was higher than that of the 3 4 3 and 1 1 2 snrs the main reason was that heavy rain occurred after transplanting which led to a large amount of n runoff loss under high n application of bf fig 5 n leaching quickly decreased with the increase in later topdressing n rates fig 7f due to the obvious increase of other loss components such as ammonia volatilization and denitrification fig 8 showed the total n loss for different n management practices the n loss increased linearly with n fertilizer rate under the same n fertilizer rate n loss of the farmers practice 5 3 1 was higher than the four other snrs and small differences were observed among the four split n application scenarios when the crop yield reached a plateau at a n fertilizer rate of 155 kg n ha 1 for the snr 1 1 4 the total amount of n loss was 73 6 kg n ha 1 which was lower than that of the farmers practice 106 2 kg n ha 1 to sum up reducing n loss and improving nue by increasing the n application ratio in the late rice growing season while reducing the total n fertilization rate was possible 4 discussion 4 1 effects of different n fertilizer rates and snrs on rice yield nitrogen is critical for ensuring high rice yield however it can lead to environmental impacts sayer and cassman 2013 thind et al 2018 the optimum n application rate is dependent on the target yield the fertilization methods timing and fertilizer types bindraban et al 2015 reasonable fertilization time and method can reduce n loss and improve nue otherwise a large amount of n fertilizer applied to the farmland will be lost to the environment through various ways thus farmers must apply high fertilizer rate to meet crop demand due to low nue therefore the appropriate fertilizer type and timing should be considered according to the crop demand in different growing stages wu et al 2015 proposed that the optimum n application rate in different rice growing areas in china ranged from 114 to 224 kg n ha 1 and the average optimal n application rate was 167 kg n ha 1 at this rate yield increased by 7 whereas greenhouse gas emissions was reduced by 11 based on the farmers practice of n application rate of 300 kg n ha 1 liu et al 2012a found that reducing n input by 20 did not lead to yield reduction and nue increased by 8 8 in this study the reduction of n fertilizer by 14 3 from farmer practice did not reduce simulated rice yield when the split n ratio was 5 3 1 fig 4a the n application rate could be reduced by 32 9 to 155 kg n ha 1 using a different split strategy without affecting yield fig 7a our results were consistent with previous studies in addition to over fertilization another common problem in rice cultivation in china is that a large proportion of n fertilizer is applied in the early stage of crop growth zhao et al 2013 the excessive application of n fertilizer in the early stage produces a large number of ineffective tillers liu et al 2012b reported that the number of tillers reached up to 3 million ha 1 when all n fertilizer was applied as bf however small spikes and low seed setting rate led to yield reduction in this study the local farmer s split n ratio of bf tf1 and tf2 was 5 3 1 n stress began at the booting stage according to the n stress factor simulated by the model fig 6 the low proportion of n fertilizer at the panicle stage resulted in n deficiency in the late rice growing stage results of this study showed that increasing the ratio of n fertilizer in the late season could reduce n stress at booting and late in the season when the snr was changed from 5 3 1 to 3 4 3 1 1 2 1 1 4 and 1 1 6 respectively and the n fertilizer rates that correspond to their highest yield were 185 173 155 and 150 kg n ha 1 respectively fig 7a the optimal n fertilizer rate in this study was consistent with the recommended fertilizer rate 167 kg n ha 1 of wu et al 2015 when the snr was 1 1 6 the yield under different n fertilizer rates was almost the same as 1 1 4 snr if the proportion of panicle fertilizer continuously increased then it may cause n stress in the early stage and lead to yield reduction these results indicate that a reduction of n fertilizer can improve nue without reducing rice yield if timing of application is adjusted thus the n fertilizer rate applied in different periods should be reasonably distributed according to the crop demands at different stages reducing the n application rate in the early stage and increasing the proportion of n fertilizer application in the middle and late stages of rice can increase rice yield and nue 4 2 effects of different n fertilizer rates and snrs on n loss to water body in paddy fields many studies have reported that high fertilizer rates have led to nitrate contamination in groundwater and water eutrophication xue et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 ensuring high yield while minimizing negative environmental impacts is important in rice cultivation n runoff loss is the main pollution resource for surface water bodies especially in the rice planting areas in south china the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river where rainfall is relatively abundant are the main rice planting areas in china the amount of n runoff loss is related to the surface water n concentration in the paddy field li et al 2018a the concentration of n in the ponding water is determined by the rate and timing of fertilizer sun et al 2016 a large amount of n fertilizer applied in the early stage of rice growth increases the risk of n loss by surface runoff liu et al 2018 guo et al 2010b showed that n runoff loss accounted for 60 of the loss over the rice season from rice transplanting to re greening and jointing period in this study the amount of runoff loss exponentially increased with n fertilizer rate when the snr was 5 3 1 the amount n runoff loss was higher than that of snrs with 3 4 3 and 1 1 2 fig 7e a large amount of runoff occurred after transplanting thus reducing the basal rate of n fertilizer could effectively lessen the loss of n through runoff which was consistent with the results reported by liu et al 2015 however when the snrs were 1 1 4 and 1 1 6 the total amount of runoff n loss was slightly higher than that of snr with 5 3 1 because the date of the second topdressing coincided with the rainy season fig 1 thus excessive panicle fertilizer lead to high n runoff loss in the late season therefore changing snr to apply more n later in the season is essential for reducing n runoff losses n leaching which threatens groundwater safety is another main pathway for n loss in paddy fields inorganic n leaching in paddy fields is mainly in the form of no3 n nh4 n is mainly distributed in the surface soil and its leaching is very low especially in the late stage of rice growth li et al 2015 liu et al 2012a showed that nitrate leaching accounted for 70 80 of the total n leaching in paddy fields according to our simulated results the difference in nh4 n leaching in different fertilizer scenarios was not significant ranging from 4 8 to 5 0 kg n ha 1 whereas nitrate leaching was different for different n management scenarios ranging from 2 4 to 20 5 kg n ha 1 fig 7f this result was consistent with that of liu et al 2012a however the results reported by tan et al 2015 disagreed with our study their results showed that the nh4 n leaching rate was slightly higher than that of no3 n due to strong denitrification which led to low no3 n content in his study under different snrs the amount of no3 n leaching gradually decreased as an increasing proportion of n fertilizer was applied in later season most of the n was lost by ammonia volatilization and runoff because a large amount of urea was applied as topdressing to the surface water thereby indirectly decreasing nitrate n leaching therefore according to the rice requirements of n fertilizer at different stages rational snr is essential in reducing n losses by runoff and leaching 4 3 effects of different n fertilizer rates and snrs on gaseous n loss in paddy fields ammonia volatilization and denitrification are the main pathways for gaseous n loss in paddy fields soares et al 2012 xu et al 2012 wang et al 2018 li et al 2018b zhan et al 2019 coskun et al 2017 pointed out that the global n fertilizer application rate was approximately 19 2 million tons of which 10 50 of n was lost to the atmosphere through ammonia volatilization in this study ammonia volatilization and denitrification accounted for 15 1 and 17 0 of the n fertilizer input respectively which was obviously higher than that of n loss by runoff and leaching table 4 wang et al 2018 found that the ammonia volatilization of farmers practice accounted for 17 7 of the n fertilizer and exponentially increased with n fertilizer rate which was consistent with our study fig 7c zhao et al 2009 reported that reducing the amount of n fertilizer can significantly reduce the loss of ammonia volatilization shang et al 2014 pointed out that nh4 concentration in surface water was the main factor that affects the loss through ammonia volatilization in this study the amount of ammonia volatilization was slightly different under various snrs fig 7c ammonia volatilization increased with n fertilizer rate in the later stage of rice growth because the topdressings was usually applied as urea to the surface water and nh4 n concentration in the surface water was high thereby increasing ammonia volatilization the paddy field was mostly flooded during the rice growing season and the denitrification process was relatively strong thereby causing a large amount of n loss n denitrification increased with n application rate dash et al 2014 reported the denitrification was 18 9 kg n ha 1 with 120 kg n ha 1 n application rate in a paddy field in india tan et al 2013 found that the denitrification rate in paddy soil was approximately 18 7 33 6 kg n ha 1 under different water and n management practices the amount of denitrification in our study was between 21 2 42 5 kg n ha 1 in different scenarios which was similar to the aforementioned results fig 7d however this result was clearly lower than that of li et al 2018b in which the simulated denitrification reached approximately 140 kg n ha 1 for the 120 cm soil depth under the water saving irrigation measures in rice paddy fields in the taihu lake basin with the n application rate of 220 kg n ha 1 this phenomenon may be due to frequent dry and wet interactions that resulted in high denitrification loss under different n fertilizer scenarios in this study the denitrification loss showed a parabolic curve with the increase in fertilizer rate fig 7d when the n fertilizer rate exceeded approximately 180 kg n ha 1 the denitrification amount began to decrease because the n loss by ammonia volatilization increased sharply in the snrs of 1 1 4 and 1 1 6 the denitrification was obviously reduced due to the excessive topdressing and the increase in ammonia volatilization although each n loss pathway had a large difference under various snrs even they showed different trends with increasing n fertilizer rates however reducing the total n fertilizer application rate and postponing n application is an efficient method in reducing total n loss and improving nue in paddy fields 4 4 limitations and future works in this study we used the whcns model to simulate the impacts of different n management strategies to crop growth and n loss in the region however we calibrated the n loss by ammonia volatilization and n runoff in 2017 and did not validate them in 2018 due to lack of the observed values so the n loss by ammonia volatilization and runoff needs to be further validated furthermore the optimal n management practices obtained by the model simulation also needs to be verified in practice for scenario analysis we only optimized n management practices and did not considered water management practices in the study area water input irrigation precipitation was about 1200 mm which obviously exceeded the requirement of rice growth nearly half of the water was lost through drainage 560 mm many water saving methods such as alternative wetting and drying irrigation belder et al 2004 dry seeding techniques thind et al 2018 and ground cover rice production systems liang et al 2019 have been developed to reduce water loss therefore water management practices should be considered when optimizing n management practices different climatic conditions have significant effects on rice growth and n loss liang et al 2011 tao et al 2014 the scenario analysis was conducted on the basis of climate condition in 2017 without considering the impact of different weather patterns in different seasons in fact the management of water and n fertilizer needs to be adjusted according to the climate conditions the adaptability of our recommended fertilization strategy also needs to be further verified under different climate conditions in future studies 5 conclusions the whcns model was calibrated and validated for a paddy rice field on the basis of two years of field measurements in the middle reaches of the yangtze river the simulated surface water depth et crop adm and crop n uptake were all in good agreement with the measured values therefore the model can be used to quantitatively analyze rice growth water dynamics and n fates in paddy fields in this area the model simulated results indicated that approximately 46 of the n fertilizer inputs was lost to the environment through various pathways ammonia volatilization and denitrification were the main pathways of n loss in this region accounting for approximately 72 of total n loss followed by n leaching 23 and runoff loss 5 scenario analysis showed that the relationship of crop yield n uptake and n fertilizer rate can be described by a linear plus platform model ammonia volatilization and runoff n loss exponentially increased with n fertilizer rate whereas denitrification and n leaching could be described by parabolic curves under different snrs the optimal amounts of n fertilizer with the highest yields decreased with the increase in the proportion of fertilizer rate at the late stage the difference in total n loss was not obvious however each n loss pathway had a large difference under various snrs the n fertilizer rate could be reduced by increasing the ratio of n fertilizer rate in the late rice season when the n fertilizer rate was 155 kg n ha 1 and the ratio of bf tiller fertilizer and panicle fertilizer was 1 1 4 the n loss was reduced by 31 compared with farmers practice therefore the optimal strategy should be recommended to farmers to reduce the risk of environmental pollution and develop sustainable rice production in the study area declaration of competing interest the authors have declared that no competing interests exist acknowledgments the study was funded by the national key research and

10786,excessive fertilization in rice paddy fields leads to surface water eutrophication groundwater contamination and air pollution determining optimum nitrogen n management is essential for maintaining rice yield while reducing the environmental risk caused by n loss a two year field experiment 2017 2018 was carried out in a typical paddy field in the middle reaches of the yangtze river the whcns soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator model was calibrated and evaluated for simulations of measured ponding water depth evapotranspiration aboveground dry matter yield runoff and crop n the model was then used to evaluate the effects of different n fertilizer rates and split n application ratios snr practices on crop growth and n losses results showed that the model performed well in simulating rice growth and n losses in the region ammonia volatilization and denitrification were the mainly pathways of n loss in paddy field and their two year average losses were 34 and 38 of the total n loss respectively n leaching accounted for 23 and runoff n loss accounted for 5 of total n loss n losses were evaluated for two different scenarios and simulated ratios of ammonia volatilization denitrification n leaching and runoff to total n loss under different n management scenarios were 15 53 33 55 6 30 and 4 8 respectively ammonia volatilization and n runoff exponentially increased with an increase of n fertilizer rate whereas denitrification and n leaching showed an increasing and then a decreasing trend yield increased by 36 kg ha 1 and the total n loss decreased by 32 6 kg n ha 1 when the n fertilizer rate was reduced from 231 kg n ha 1 to 155 kg n ha 1 and the snr was changed from 5 3 1 to 1 1 4 therefore reducing the n fertilizer rate and increasing the snr in the late rice growing season can significantly reduce n loss and effectively improve n use efficiency keywords rice split n application n loss optimal n management whcns model 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l is a major cereal crop that supports more than half of the world s population khush 2005 the rice cultivated area of china has recently reached 30 45 million ha and grain yield production is over 200 million tons which accounts for 19 of the world s total rice planted area and 25 of global rice yield fao 2017 nitrogen n fertilizer plays an important role in rice cultivation rice crops in china consumed about 37 of the total n fertilizer used for rice production in the world peng et al 2002 however only 30 40 of the n fertilizer is used by the crop while approximately 50 of n applied is lost to the environment by ammonia volatilization denitrification runoff and leaching zhu and chen 2002 this situation results in a series of serious environmental problems such as soil acidification guo 2010a groundwater pollution zhang et al 2017 water eutrophication zhao et al 2014 2016 and air pollution pappa et al 2011 li et al 2018b wang et al 2018 2019 to improve n use efficiency nue and reduce environmental pollution caused by excessive n fertilizer application the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of china recently proposed the implementation of zero increase in fertilizer use excessive n fertilizer application not only failed to achieve high yield but also led to a serious loss of n in rice production yan et al 2009 reported that there was no significant increase in rice yield when n inputs exceeded 150 kg n ha 1 wang et al 2019 demonstrated that n application primarily affected n loss to the environment but had little effect on rice yield at n rates above 130 to 170 kg n ha 1 reducing the total n application rate is an effective method to reduce n loss and improve nue in paddy fields zhang et al 2018b found that decreasing the n application rate effectively reduces n loss for instance the amount of n loss was reduced by 21 45 when the n fertilizer rate reduced from 74 8 112 3 kg n ha 1 to 59 1 70 4 kg n ha 1 zhang et al 2017 investigated n leaching for different n levels in a rice wheat rotation system and found that the total n leaching of a reduced n strategy was 30 87 lower than that of the conventional practice and crop yield increased by 23 56 zhao et al 2016 recommended that 100 kg n ha 1 organic fertilizer combined with 150 kg n ha 1 chemical fertilizer in shanghai effectively reduced n loss from runoff and leaching in paddy fields while maintaining high yield implementing a split n application ratio snr according to the rice requirement at different stages is another way to improve nue and reduce n loss yang et al 2013 emphasized that site specific n management remarkably decreased n loss through ammonia volatilization runoff and leaching liu et al 2019 examined the responses of yield and nue to different n fertilizer managements in the philippines and found that increasing the n fertilizer rate at the heading stage increases rice yield by 6 7 and improve nue prasad and mailapalli 2018 suggested that four n splits at basal tillering panicle initiation and heading stages could reduce nitrate leaching in paddy fields liu et al 2018 reported that under the n application rate of 300 kg n ha 1 the snr in the ratio of 1 1 3 of basal tiller and panicle growth stages in taihu lake could effectively reduce the n loss by surface runoff in paddy fields however these studies mainly focused on reducing n loss and improving nue under improved n management few studies have considered the relationships between n losses and different n managements strategies quantifying n loss under different n fertilizer management strategies is critical for reducing environmental impacts most studies about n losses under different n managements strategies were mainly based on field experiments however the field dynamic observation of n leaching denitrification and other n losses are time consuming and costly to overcome this shortcoming soil crop system models such as ceres rice oryza hydrus 1d and dndc have been used to simulate rice growth and n losses in paddy fields under different water and n management and environmental conditions for example zhao et al 2014 used the dndc model to simulate surface runoff and subsurface n leaching in paddy fields in shanghai li et al 2015a 2018b used the hydrus 1d model to simulate the n loss under different water and n managements in direct seeding and transplant rice fields in taihu lake tan et al 2015 investigated the effects of alternating wet and dry irrigation on water drainage and n leaching in paddy fields by using the hydrus 1d model antonopoulos 2010 used the ricewnb model to simulate rice growth water balance and n fates in paddy fields zhang et al 2018a used the ceres rice model to simulate rice growth under different climatic scenarios and latitudes hameed et al 2019 used the oryza v3 model to optimize water and n management practices to improve crop yield and nue in rice paddy however different models have their strength and weaknesses the hydrus 1d model has been widely used to simulate the water movement and solute transport but it failed to simulate the crop growth due to lack of crop module the oryza and ceres rice models can simulate crop growth process very well but the effect of n stress on rice growth is limited the dndc model used a generalized crop growth curve to simulate crop growth so the effects of climate on crop growth and its interactions with soil biogeochemical processes are not considered recently an integrated soil crop model whcns soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator was developed based on the chinese climate soil types and field management to optimize water and n management liang et al 2016a the model has been successfully applied to simulate water use n loss and water and n use efficiencies under ground cover rice production system in the middle reaches of the yangtze river liang et al 2019 at present studies on n fertilizer application in paddy fields are mainly focused on assessing the effects of n fertilizer rates on crop yield and n loss few studies had evaluated the effects of different snr under the same n fertilizer rate on crop yield and n losses in paddy fields therefore the objectives of this study are to i analyze the water consumption and n losses under the conventional farmer s practice and identify the main pathways of n losses in the middle reaches of the yangtze river and ii determine the relationships between different n fertilizer rates and snrs and crop yield and n losses in rice fields and identify an optimal n application strategy for this region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experiment design a field experiment was conducted at the jingzhou agricultural meteorological experiment station 30 21 n 112 09 e in the middle reaches of the yangtze river in jingzhou city hubei province china the study area has a humid monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 16 c an average annual rainfall of 1095 mm and a groundwater depth of approximately 90 cm a rice rapeseed rotation was planted for the last 10 years the field experiment began in may 2017 and ended in september 2018 thereby including two rice growing seasons in 2017 and 2018 rice oryza sativa l cv fengliangyou xiang no 1 indica was transplanted on june 6 and 9 with density of 9 plants m 2 and harvested on september 14 and september 18 respectively the plot area was 150 m2 25 m 6 m with three replicates according to local farmers practices an n fertilizer rate of 230 9 kg n ha 1 was applied along with 26 7 kg p ha 1 phosphate and 40 4 kg k ha 1 potassium basal fertilizer bf was incorporated using a compound mixture of urea and ammonium sulfate before transplanting topdressings of n were applied at the tillering tf1 and heading stages tf2 and the snr was applied in a ratio of 5 3 1 water management in each plot was flooding midseason drainage frequent water logging with intermittent irrigation fu et al 2019 table 1 shows the detailed field management before starting the experiment soil samples were collected by using a steel ring at depths of 0 20 20 30 and 30 90 cm to determine the soil bulk density and particle fraction which were used to estimate the hydraulic parameters by a pedotransfer function model using the rosetta software schaap 1999 table 2 the soil ph soil organic carbon soc and total n content in the topsoil were 8 1 7 9 g kg 1 and 1 2 g kg 1 respectively the soil was classified as hydragric anthrosol according to the world reference base for soil resources iuss working group wrb 2006 table 2 shows the soil physical properties e g bulk density soil hydraulic parameter and texture in the soil profile 2 2 observations and measurement methods the depth of the ponding water was manually measured every two hours during the daytime by a ruler fixed in the field and its average value at night was estimated by linear interpolation between observations the irrigation amount was manually recorded using a water meter the runoff pools were installed for three plots before the experiment the runoff water depth was collected to calculate the runoff volume for every event and the concentration of nh4 n and no3 n in the water samples were determined by using a flow analyzer auto analyzer 3 bran luebbe germany the amount of n runoff during the rice growing season was calculated by 1 n r i l n r i c i where nr was the amount of n loss through runoff kg n ha 1 ri was the runoff amount occurring in the ith event mm and ci represented the concentration of soil inorganic n in the runoff water mg l 1 ammonia volatilization was measured by the dynamic box method in 2017 the ammonia collection device consisted of a closed cover a snorkel a gas wash bottle and a vacuum pump the gas wash bottle was filled with 60 ml of 20 g l 1 boric acid h3bo3 solution to collect nh3 from rice fields after the application of bf and the first topdressing tf1 nh3 flux was measured every 2 h in the daytime from june 6 to july 1 respectively during the midseason drainage period and after the second topdressing tf2 nh3 flux measurements were reduced to twice a day from july 2 to 17 from the second topdressing until harvest july 18 to sept 14 the frequency was reduced to four times a week zhan et al 2019 due to lack of workers the n losses by runoff and ammonia volatilization were not measured in 2018 aboveground dry matter was measured at middle and maximum tillering panicle initiation flowering and maturity on each sampling date eight hills were harvested and dried at 70 c to a constant weight exactly 1 m2 of undisturbed area in the center of each plot was harvested for determining grain yield and straw dry yield when the crop was mature after each plant sample was taken the total n content of the plants was determined using a c and n element analyzer flash2000 thermo usa the weather data at the experimental site rainfall air temperature relatively humidity solar radiation and wind speed were collected every 30 min using an automatic weather station the latent and sensible heat fluxes were observed at the 2 m height at 30 min intervals using an eddy covariance system li7500 li cor usa and soil heat flux was also measured at the 10 cm soil depth at 30 min intervals hfp01 campbell usa evapotranspiration et was directly measured using the eddy covariance

study liang et al 2016a the model runs on a daily time step and is driven by meteorological data and crop physiology parameters it can be used to simulate crop growth soil water movement n transport and transformation and heat transfer the model uses the penman monteith method to estimate the reference crop et allen et al 1998 the soil water infiltration and redistribution process under unsaturated conditions is computed by the green ampt model and richards equation hachum and alfaro 1980 darcy s law is used to compute soil water flow under saturated condition the daily surface water depth is estimated by using the water balance equation 3 p w n p w n 1 i n p n e t n r n i n f n where pwn and pwn 1 represent the ponding water depth mm on day n and n 1 day respectively in is the irrigation amount mm d 1 pn is the precipitation mm d 1 and etn is the evapotranspiration on day n mm d 1 rn represents the runoff on day n mm d 1 and infn is the water infiltration flux on day n mm d 1 for paddy fields the maximum ponding water depth equals the height of the field ridge in the case of heavy precipitation the pool must be filled first and runoff occurs after the water exceeds the field ridge soil c and n cycling concepts were directly taken from the daisy model hansen et al 2012 the soil n transport process is described by the convection dispersion equation and the key processes such as net mineralization urea hydrolysis ammonia volatilization nitrification denitrification and crop uptake are included in the sink source terms the general ps123 crop model is used to simulate annual crop growth processes including crop development stage lai photosynthate accumulation and allocation maintenance and growth respiration and crop yield formation driessen and konjin 1992 the daily water stress factor is computed by dividing the actual evaporation by the potential evaporation the n stress ns factor was derived based on the simulation of the crop n demand actual crop n uptake and soil n supply more detailed information is available in liang et al 2016a the whcns model has been successfully used to simulate various crops such as wheat corn rice and vegetables in the north china plain and south and northwest china li et al 2015b liang et al 2016b 2017 2018 shi et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 2 4 scenario analysis the whcns model was used to simulate the crop yield and n fates under different n management practices and two scenarios were evaluated based on farmers practice in 2017 to obtain the optimal n fertilizer strategy for the study region in the first scenario set1 11 different n fertilizer rates were simulated at 10 intervals from 70 to 30 of the farmers practice 231 kg n ha 1 the minimum rate was 69 kg n ha 1 and the maximum rate was 300 kg n ha 1 the method and date of irrigation and fertilizer application were all consistent with the farmer s practice table1 in the second scenario set2 four additional scenarios representing different snrs based on the snr 5 3 1 of the current farmers practice were 3 4 3 1 1 2 1 1 4 and 1 1 6 in each of the snr scenarios 11 different n fertilizer rates in set1 were combined with each snr scenario in set2 giving a total of 55 11 5 different n fertilizer management scenarios for evaluation these scenarios were conducted by only varying the n application strategy of set1 or set2 while other field management practices were maintained the same as the farmer s practice in 2017 2 5 model evaluation statistics three statistical indices including root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and index of agreement d were used to evaluate the model performance willmott 1982 the three deviation statistics were calculated using the following equations 4 r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 5 d 1 i l n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o p i o 2 6 n s e 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where pi and oi are the simulated and measured values o is the mean of the measured values and n is the number of values the rmse represents the absolute error between measured and simulated values the d statistic is a descriptive measure of model fit and ranges from 0 to 1 the closer the value to 1 the better the model performance nse ranges between and 1 and allows for negative error values of d 0 75 and nse 0 is the minimum threshold values for crop growth values of d 0 60 and nse 1 is the minimum threshold values for soil outputs evaluation yang et al 2014 3 results 3 1 model calibration and evaluation before the model calibration the morris method was used to analyze the global sensitivities of input parameters soil hydraulic parameters crop parameters and n turnover parameters of the whcns model then according to the sensitivity analysis results the trial and error method was used to calibrate the model highly sensitive parameters were chosen to calibrate the model to minimize error between simulated and measured values in 2017 including ponding water depth et dry matter weight yield crop n uptake ammonium volatilization and n runoff after the calibration the input parameters were all fixed and the model was evaluated using the measured data in 2018 figs 1 3 showed the calibration and evaluation results the simulated ponding water depth et dry matter and crop n uptake were in good agreement with the measured values the maximum ponding water depth was 50 mm in 2017 and 90 mm in 2018 fig 1 the average ponding water depth in 2018 was higher than that in 2017 the difference in et was small for two years fig 2 the dry matter in 2017 was higher than that in 2018 fig 3a the reason was that the seedlings transplanted in 2018 were later than in 2017 thereby causing delay of a few days later for the rice development in 2018 the simulated crop n uptake in 2017 was higher than in 2018 because of the higher dry matter values in 2017 fig 3b from the middle to the late periods of rice growth simulated crop n uptake for two years were higher than the measured values because we ignored the root n uptake in the measurement the differences between the simulated and measured yield in 2017 and 2018 were 2 and 980 kg ha 1 respectively table 4 giving a simulation error of less than 10 which was within an acceptable range for runoff the simulation error was 42 and 4 mm for the two years respectively the differences between simulated and measured ammonia volatilization and n runoff in 2017 were 1 1 and 0 7 kg n ha 1 respectively and their differences were both small table 3 showed the evaluation statistic of model performance for the model calibration the rmse values of the ponding water depth et adm and crop n uptake in 2017 were 16 03 mm 1 44 mm 414 kg ha 1 and 15 02 kg n ha 1 respectively the evaluation indices of d and nse were 0 93 except for the depth of the ponding water in 2017 the d 0 77 and nse 0 38 values for the ponding water depth were relatively low mainly because of the large difference between the simulated and measured values at 15 27 days after transplanting only a small amount of rainfall was observed on the 22nd and 23rd day during this period and the difference may be caused by measurement errors of ponding water depth during that period for model evaluation the rmse values of ponding water depth et adm and crop n uptake in 2018 were 15 74 mm 1 18 mm 375 kg ha 1 and 16 89 kg n ha 1 respectively except for ponding water depth nse value of 0 70 the values of d and nse for other observed values were 0 92 the values of all the evaluation indices for two years were within the acceptable range and good agreement was observed between the simulated and measured values therefore the model gave good performance and can be used to simulate rice growth water movement and n fates in the study area 3 2 water consumption and n fates table 4 showed the simulated results of water consumption and n fates in the 0 90 cm soil profile during the rice growth season for both years the rainfall in the rice growth season in 2017 was 100 mm higher than that in 2018 and the irrigation amount in 2018 was 100 mm more than that in 2017 thus the amount of water inputs precipitation irrigation for both years was almost the same drainage was the main component of water loss accounting for 44 and 49 of the water input in 2017 and 2018 respectively the et in 2018 was higher than that in 2017 in contrast with 2017 the average temperature in 2018 was higher thereby leading to a relatively larger soil evaporation however its effect on transpiration was limited and the transpiration between the two years was not obvious the amount of runoff among the water outputs was the smallest in 2017 the amount of runoff was approximately twice that in 2018 the wue was higher in 2017 than 2018 because of the higher et in 2018 from the n balance table 4 n input fertilization net mineralization n irrigation wet deposition was almost the same for both years approximately 307 kg n ha 1 crop n uptake was the largest n output approximately 190 kg n ha 1 accounting for 64 4 of the total n output gaseous n loss surface runoff and n leaching were the main pathways for n loss in the paddy field gaseous loss ammonia volatilization denitrification was obviously higher than those by water body loss runoff leaching the two year average of denitrification ammonia volatilization n leaching and runoff loss accounted for 17 16 10 and 3 of the n fertilizer rate respectively the amount of n loss by denitrification was the highest because of the long term flooding conditions during the rice growing season the second largest loss was ammonia volatilization because of the two topdressings which were directly applied to the surface water the simulated n leaching in 2017 and 2018 were 25 3 and 22 5 kg n ha 1 respectively n loss by runoff was the smallest among all n losses components which was mainly determined by the n concentration in the surface water the nue was lower in 2017 than in 2018 due to the slightly higher yield in 2018 however the difference in the total amount of n loss for both years was not obvious table 4 3 3 crop yield and n fates under different n fertilization scenarios 3 3 1 effects of different n fertilizer rates on crop yield and n fates a large amount of n was lost to the environment under the farmers practice according to the model simulation results the average amount of total n loss by ammonia volatilization denitrification runoff and leaching was approximately 105 kg n ha 1 for both years accounting for 35 6 of the total n output table 4 the validated model was used to simulate the crop yield and n fates under different n fertilizer rates to improve nue and reduce n losses in paddy fields based on the farmers practice in 2017 fig 4 a and b showed that the simulated yield and n uptake increased linearly with the n fertilizer rate when the n fertilizer rate exceeded 198 kg n ha 1 the yield and n uptake reached the maximum and no obvious change was observed in crop yield and n uptake as the n application rate increased the relationship between crop yield and n uptake and n fertilizer rate could be described by a linear plus platform model however various n loss pathways obviously increased with the n fertilizer rate for the gaseous n loss fig 4c the amount of ammonia volatilization exponentially increased with n fertilizer rate whereas the increased rate of denitrification gradually reduced under higher n application rates this phenomenon could be described by a parabolic equation for the n loss from the pond fig 4d the amount of n runoff exponentially increased with n fertilizer rate n leaching increased until an n rate of approximately 200 kg n ha 1 then decreased with an increase in n fertilizer rate the reason may be that the proportion of ammonia volatilization denitrification and runoff loss from surface water obviously increased at the higher n fertilizer rates thereby decreasing n leaching in summary when n fertilizer rate exceeded 198 kg n ha 1 total n loss sharply increased while yield remained constant 3 3 2 effects of different snrs on crop yield and n fates the aforementioned results showed that the best n fertilizer rate was 198 kg n ha 1 when only the crop yield and n uptake were considered at this rate n loss by ammonia volatilization denitrification leaching and runoff were 28 6 37 2 25 2 and 5 9 kg n ha 1 respectively fig 4 a large amount of n 97 kg n ha 1 was still lost to the environment however optimizing the fertilization rate further was necessary to reduce environmental impacts fig 5 showed the dynamic changes of n loss during the rice growing season when the n fertilizer rate was 198 kg n ha 1 the ammonia volatilization denitrification leaching and runoff losses accounted for 98 58 22 and 81 of the total n loss within 50 days after transplanting the high levels of n fertilization in the early season caused a large amount of ammonia volatilization and n runoff loss the fluctuation of denitrification was small because the rice mostly grew under flooded condition n leaching loss mainly occurred in the late stage of rice growth due to frequent irrigation fig 6 showed the simulated nitrogen stress ns factor in each crop growing season when n fertilizer rate was 198 kg n ha 1 when the ns was zero the n supply was sufficient to meet crop demand high values of ns corresponded to severe ns ns began at approximately 65 days after transplanting and gradually increased the arrows represented the fertilizer application date in 2017 and 2018 farmers usually applied a large amount of fertilizer in the early stage of crop growth and in this experiment only a small amount was applied by topdressing for both years the two bf applications accounted for 57 of the total n applied with the first bf accouting for 34 and the 2nd bf accounting for 9 of the total n applied this resulted in a simulated n deficiency in the late stages of crop growth which may have impacted yield reducing the amount of fertilizer applied in the early stage and increasing the amount in the middle and late stages of rice growth are important to further reduce the amount of n loss four different snrs were evaluated and model simulations were performed on the basis of the ratio of farmers snr 5 3 1 fig 7 showed the yield and n fates under different n split application strategies the relationships between crop yield and crop n uptake and n fertilizer rate could be described by linear plus platform model under different snrs fig 7a b when the snrs were 3 4 3 1 1 2 1 1 4 and 1 1 6 their corresponding n fertilizer rates at the peak were 185 173 155 and 150 kg n ha 1 respectively thereby showing a gradually reducing trend however the difference in yield and crop n uptake at peak between the two ratios of 1 1 4 and 1 1 6 was not obvious therefore optimal n fertilizer rate could further improve yield and nue large differences were observed for each component of n loss among the five snrs fig 7 the amount of ammonia volatilization gradually increased with n fertilizer rates fig 7c topdressing was applied by surface application and the temperature in the late season was higher than in the early growing season thus the increase in topdressing n rate increased ammonia volatilization denitrification generally increased with increasing n rate reached a peak then decreased with higher application rates fig 7d when n fertilizer rate was low the amount of denitrification increased with the proportion of n applied in the later application after the application rate exceeds about 160 kg n ha 1 the snrs of 1 1 4 and 1 1 6 showed a decreasing trend which was lower than the three other snrs the amount of n runoff loss increased with the proportion of n fertilizer application in the late stage of rice growth mainly because a large amount of runoff occurred in the late rice season fig 7e however n runoff of the 5 3 1 snr was higher than that of the 3 4 3 and 1 1 2 snrs the main reason was that heavy rain occurred after transplanting which led to a large amount of n runoff loss under high n application of bf fig 5 n leaching quickly decreased with the increase in later topdressing n rates fig 7f due to the obvious increase of other loss components such as ammonia volatilization and denitrification fig 8 showed the total n loss for different n management practices the n loss increased linearly with n fertilizer rate under the same n fertilizer rate n loss of the farmers practice 5 3 1 was higher than the four other snrs and small differences were observed among the four split n application scenarios when the crop yield reached a plateau at a n fertilizer rate of 155 kg n ha 1 for the snr 1 1 4 the total amount of n loss was 73 6 kg n ha 1 which was lower than that of the farmers practice 106 2 kg n ha 1 to sum up reducing n loss and improving nue by increasing the n application ratio in the late rice growing season while reducing the total n fertilization rate was possible 4 discussion 4 1 effects of different n fertilizer rates and snrs on rice yield nitrogen is critical for ensuring high rice yield however it can lead to environmental impacts sayer and cassman 2013 thind et al 2018 the optimum n application rate is dependent on the target yield the fertilization methods timing and fertilizer types bindraban et al 2015 reasonable fertilization time and method can reduce n loss and improve nue otherwise a large amount of n fertilizer applied to the farmland will be lost to the environment through various ways thus farmers must apply high fertilizer rate to meet crop demand due to low nue therefore the appropriate fertilizer type and timing should be considered according to the crop demand in different growing stages wu et al 2015 proposed that the optimum n application rate in different rice growing areas in china ranged from 114 to 224 kg n ha 1 and the average optimal n application rate was 167 kg n ha 1 at this rate yield increased by 7 whereas greenhouse gas emissions was reduced by 11 based on the farmers practice of n application rate of 300 kg n ha 1 liu et al 2012a found that reducing n input by 20 did not lead to yield reduction and nue increased by 8 8 in this study the reduction of n fertilizer by 14 3 from farmer practice did not reduce simulated rice yield when the split n ratio was 5 3 1 fig 4a the n application rate could be reduced by 32 9 to 155 kg n ha 1 using a different split strategy without affecting yield fig 7a our results were consistent with previous studies in addition to over fertilization another common problem in rice cultivation in china is that a large proportion of n fertilizer is applied in the early stage of crop growth zhao et al 2013 the excessive application of n fertilizer in the early stage produces a large number of ineffective tillers liu et al 2012b reported that the number of tillers reached up to 3 million ha 1 when all n fertilizer was applied as bf however small spikes and low seed setting rate led to yield reduction in this study the local farmer s split n ratio of bf tf1 and tf2 was 5 3 1 n stress began at the booting stage according to the n stress factor simulated by the model fig 6 the low proportion of n fertilizer at the panicle stage resulted in n deficiency in the late rice growing stage results of this study showed that increasing the ratio of n fertilizer in the late season could reduce n stress at booting and late in the season when the snr was changed from 5 3 1 to 3 4 3 1 1 2 1 1 4 and 1 1 6 respectively and the n fertilizer rates that correspond to their highest yield were 185 173 155 and 150 kg n ha 1 respectively fig 7a the optimal n fertilizer rate in this study was consistent with the recommended fertilizer rate 167 kg n ha 1 of wu et al 2015 when the snr was 1 1 6 the yield under different n fertilizer rates was almost the same as 1 1 4 snr if the proportion of panicle fertilizer continuously increased then it may cause n stress in the early stage and lead to yield reduction these results indicate that a reduction of n fertilizer can improve nue without reducing rice yield if timing of application is adjusted thus the n fertilizer rate applied in different periods should be reasonably distributed according to the crop demands at different stages reducing the n application rate in the early stage and increasing the proportion of n fertilizer application in the middle and late stages of rice can increase rice yield and nue 4 2 effects of different n fertilizer rates and snrs on n loss to water body in paddy fields many studies have reported that high fertilizer rates have led to nitrate contamination in groundwater and water eutrophication xue et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 ensuring high yield while minimizing negative environmental impacts is important in rice cultivation n runoff loss is the main pollution resource for surface water bodies especially in the rice planting areas in south china the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river where rainfall is relatively abundant are the main rice planting areas in china the amount of n runoff loss is related to the surface water n concentration in the paddy field li et al 2018a the concentration of n in the ponding water is determined by the rate and timing of fertilizer sun et al 2016 a large amount of n fertilizer applied in the early stage of rice growth increases the risk of n loss by surface runoff liu et al 2018 guo et al 2010b showed that n runoff loss accounted for 60 of the loss over the rice season from rice transplanting to re greening and jointing period in this study the amount of runoff loss exponentially increased with n fertilizer rate when the snr was 5 3 1 the amount n runoff loss was higher than that of snrs with 3 4 3 and 1 1 2 fig 7e a large amount of runoff occurred after transplanting thus reducing the basal rate of n fertilizer could effectively lessen the loss of n through runoff which was consistent with the results reported by liu et al 2015 however when the snrs were 1 1 4 and 1 1 6 the total amount of runoff n loss was slightly higher than that of snr with 5 3 1 because the date of the second topdressing coincided with the rainy season fig 1 thus excessive panicle fertilizer lead to high n runoff loss in the late season therefore changing snr to apply more n later in the season is essential for reducing n runoff losses n leaching which threatens groundwater safety is another main pathway for n loss in paddy fields inorganic n leaching in paddy fields is mainly in the form of no3 n nh4 n is mainly distributed in the surface soil and its leaching is very low especially in the late stage of rice growth li et al 2015 liu et al 2012a showed that nitrate leaching accounted for 70 80 of the total n leaching in paddy fields according to our simulated results the difference in nh4 n leaching in different fertilizer scenarios was not significant ranging from 4 8 to 5 0 kg n ha 1 whereas nitrate leaching was different for different n management scenarios ranging from 2 4 to 20 5 kg n ha 1 fig 7f this result was consistent with that of liu et al 2012a however the results reported by tan et al 2015 disagreed with our study their results showed that the nh4 n leaching rate was slightly higher than that of no3 n due to strong denitrification which led to low no3 n content in his study under different snrs the amount of no3 n leaching gradually decreased as an increasing proportion of n fertilizer was applied in later season most of the n was lost by ammonia volatilization and runoff because a large amount of urea was applied as topdressing to the surface water thereby indirectly decreasing nitrate n leaching therefore according to the rice requirements of n fertilizer at different stages rational snr is essential in reducing n losses by runoff and leaching 4 3 effects of different n fertilizer rates and snrs on gaseous n loss in paddy fields ammonia volatilization and denitrification are the main pathways for gaseous n loss in paddy fields soares et al 2012 xu et al 2012 wang et al 2018 li et al 2018b zhan et al 2019 coskun et al 2017 pointed out that the global n fertilizer application rate was approximately 19 2 million tons of which 10 50 of n was lost to the atmosphere through ammonia volatilization in this study ammonia volatilization and denitrification accounted for 15 1 and 17 0 of the n fertilizer input respectively which was obviously higher than that of n loss by runoff and leaching table 4 wang et al 2018 found that the ammonia volatilization of farmers practice accounted for 17 7 of the n fertilizer and exponentially increased with n fertilizer rate which was consistent with our study fig 7c zhao et al 2009 reported that reducing the amount of n fertilizer can significantly reduce the loss of ammonia volatilization shang et al 2014 pointed out that nh4 concentration in surface water was the main factor that affects the loss through ammonia volatilization in this study the amount of ammonia volatilization was slightly different under various snrs fig 7c ammonia volatilization increased with n fertilizer rate in the later stage of rice growth because the topdressings was usually applied as urea to the surface water and nh4 n concentration in the surface water was high thereby increasing ammonia volatilization the paddy field was mostly flooded during the rice growing season and the denitrification process was relatively strong thereby causing a large amount of n loss n denitrification increased with n application rate dash et al 2014 reported the denitrification was 18 9 kg n ha 1 with 120 kg n ha 1 n application rate in a paddy field in india tan et al 2013 found that the denitrification rate in paddy soil was approximately 18 7 33 6 kg n ha 1 under different water and n management practices the amount of denitrification in our study was between 21 2 42 5 kg n ha 1 in different scenarios which was similar to the aforementioned results fig 7d however this result was clearly lower than that of li et al 2018b in which the simulated denitrification reached approximately 140 kg n ha 1 for the 120 cm soil depth under the water saving irrigation measures in rice paddy fields in the taihu lake basin with the n application rate of 220 kg n ha 1 this phenomenon may be due to frequent dry and wet interactions that resulted in high denitrification loss under different n fertilizer scenarios in this study the denitrification loss showed a parabolic curve with the increase in fertilizer rate fig 7d when the n fertilizer rate exceeded approximately 180 kg n ha 1 the denitrification amount began to decrease because the n loss by ammonia volatilization increased sharply in the snrs of 1 1 4 and 1 1 6 the denitrification was obviously reduced due to the excessive topdressing and the increase in ammonia volatilization although each n loss pathway had a large difference under various snrs even they showed different trends with increasing n fertilizer rates however reducing the total n fertilizer application rate and postponing n application is an efficient method in reducing total n loss and improving nue in paddy fields 4 4 limitations and future works in this study we used the whcns model to simulate the impacts of different n management strategies to crop growth and n loss in the region however we calibrated the n loss by ammonia volatilization and n runoff in 2017 and did not validate them in 2018 due to lack of the observed values so the n loss by ammonia volatilization and runoff needs to be further validated furthermore the optimal n management practices obtained by the model simulation also needs to be verified in practice for scenario analysis we only optimized n management practices and did not considered water management practices in the study area water input irrigation precipitation was about 1200 mm which obviously exceeded the requirement of rice growth nearly half of the water was lost through drainage 560 mm many water saving methods such as alternative wetting and drying irrigation belder et al 2004 dry seeding techniques thind et al 2018 and ground cover rice production systems liang et al 2019 have been developed to reduce water loss therefore water management practices should be considered when optimizing n management practices different climatic conditions have significant effects on rice growth and n loss liang et al 2011 tao et al 2014 the scenario analysis was conducted on the basis of climate condition in 2017 without considering the impact of different weather patterns in different seasons in fact the management of water and n fertilizer needs to be adjusted according to the climate conditions the adaptability of our recommended fertilization strategy also needs to be further verified under different climate conditions in future studies 5 conclusions the whcns model was calibrated and validated for a paddy rice field on the basis of two years of field measurements in the middle reaches of the yangtze river the simulated surface water depth et crop adm and crop n uptake were all in good agreement with the measured values therefore the model can be used to quantitatively analyze rice growth water dynamics and n fates in paddy fields in this area the model simulated results indicated that approximately 46 of the n fertilizer inputs was lost to the environment through various pathways ammonia volatilization and denitrification were the main pathways of n loss in this region accounting for approximately 72 of total n loss followed by n leaching 23 and runoff loss 5 scenario analysis showed that the relationship of crop yield n uptake and n fertilizer rate can be described by a linear plus platform model ammonia volatilization and runoff n loss exponentially increased with n fertilizer rate whereas denitrification and n leaching could be described by parabolic curves under different snrs the optimal amounts of n fertilizer with the highest yields decreased with the increase in the proportion of fertilizer rate at the late stage the difference in total n loss was not obvious however each n loss pathway had a large difference under various snrs the n fertilizer rate could be reduced by increasing the ratio of n fertilizer rate in the late rice season when the n fertilizer rate was 155 kg n ha 1 and the ratio of bf tiller fertilizer and panicle fertilizer was 1 1 4 the n loss was reduced by 31 compared with farmers practice therefore the optimal strategy should be recommended to farmers to reduce the risk of environmental pollution and develop sustainable rice production in the study area declaration of competing interest the authors have declared that no competing interests exist acknowledgments the study was funded by the national key research and

10787,vertical impact and turbine drive sprinklers are the most widely used high volume sprinklers with both solid set spray and hose drawn traveler irrigator systems different mechanical structures and driving modes between the two types of sprinklers will inevitably lead to differences in spray performance which may affect the adaptability of each sprinkler thus far there are few comparative studies that have quantitatively analyzed the spray characteristics of the two types of gun sprinklers resulting in the lack of guidance in sprinkler type selection for both sprinkler system designers and farmers in this paper the vertical impact drive gun sprinkler 50pyc and turbine drive gun sprinkler hy50 were used to conduct a comparative analysis of water distribution and kinetic energy distribution between these two commonly used sprinklers the results show that the average radial application rate of 50pyc was 11 0 35 9 higher than that of hy50 under fixed spray conditions under mobile spray conditions the water distribution of the two gun sprinklers initially increased and then decreased as the distance from the travel lane increased exhibiting a unimodal distribution both the cumulative irrigation depth and average radial application rate of 50pyc were significantly higher than those of hy50 in the spray area close to the travel lane under overlapping spraying conditions using two adjacent sprinklers of the same type various working pressures and different spacing between sprinklers the maximum distribution uniformity coefficients of the 50pyc gun sprinkler reached 80 5 to 87 8 while the maximum distribution uniformity coefficients of the hy50 gun sprinkler were approximately 67 1 to 76 9 5 3 to 13 5 lower than that of 50pyc under fixed spray conditions the peak values of spray kinetic energy of the turbine drive hy50 was about 1 5 2 7 times that of the 50pyc gun sprinkler under different working pressures under mobile spray conditions the cumulative kinetic energy in the whole spray area of the hy50 gun sprinkler was about 1 5 2 4 times that of the 50pyc gun sprinkler this quantitative study on two common types of sprinkler guns vertical impact and turbine drive sprinklers indicates that to comprehensively obtain greater irrigation benefits soil and crop types irrigation water quality and economic and labor costs should also be taken into consideration when selecting between the two gun sprinklers keywords vertical impact drive turbine drive high volume sprinkler application rate kinetic energy 1 introduction big gun sprinklers have been widely used in agricultural irrigation due to their advantages of high flow rate generally higher than 5 l s 1 wide spray area and high flexibility especially in combination with a hose drawn traveler irrigator ge et al 2018a as the chinese government has continuously increased investment on high efficiency water saving irrigation projects nearly 1 4 million hectares of arable land will be implemented with sprinkler irrigation systems during the 13th five year plan 2016 2020 consequently a vast number of high volume sprinklers vertical impact or turbine drive models have been applied in agricultural production the respective 50pyc and hy50 models are the typical vertical impact and turbine drive gun sprinklers used in china tang et al 2016 in 2015 the numbers of these two kinds of sprinklers put into production exceeded 20 000 zhang 2016 although 50pyc and hy50 both fall into the category of high flow rate sprinklers keller and bliesner 1990 there is a significant difference in the driving mechanism that rotates each of the two sprinklers fig 1 the vertical impact sprinkler 50pyc rotates by virtue of the reaction force from the water jet and the actuator includes a vertical swing rocker a reaction shovel and a balance weight on the other hand in the turbine drive sprinkler hy50 a stream of water ejected from a secondary nozzle impacts the turbine and drives the transmission mechanism to rotate the sprinkler due to the high impact speed of the water jet the rotating speed of the impeller can reach up to 2000 r min 1 unfortunately there are few reports on the spray hydraulic characteristics of the two gun sprinklers and whether the difference of spray performance affects the environments in which the sprinklers are applied therefore it is common to find potential users getting confused in selecting between the two types of gun sprinklers in addition the manufacturers are also unable to provide effective guidance in selection thus it was necessary to carry out this comparative study to provide practical information to sprinkler system designers and users on the selection of gun sprinkler type for the purpose of irrigation quality improvement according to the american society of civil engineers asce irrigation efficiency and uniformity are the key indicators in the evaluation of irrigation quality burt et al 1997 the higher the irrigation efficiency the lower the amount of irrigation water should be consumed irrigation uniformity relates closely to crop yield mantovani et al 1995 surface runoff bernuth 1983 deep percolation of water and nutrient leaching vories and bernuth 1986 uneven water distribution contributes to the waste of both water and energy consumption ascough et al 2002 irrigation efficiency and uniformity of big gun sprinklers remain at low levels in all kinds of sprinklers systems rolim and teixeira 2016 the irrigation efficiency of big gun sprinklers is 58 according to the bc sprinkler irrigation manual vander 1989 the water distribution uniformity of hose drawn travelers is only 62 according to the test results of wigginton and raine 2001 there are many factors that affect irrigation uniformity and efficiency of big gun sprinklers the most direct factors are the distribution of water application and kinetic energy of droplets from the big gun sprinklers the water distribution of a big gun sprinkler depends on sprinkler type flow rate working pressure as well as the radiation angle and overlapping spray distance under traveling spray conditions ge et al 2016a commonly used spray uniformity coefficients include the christiansen christiansen 1942 distribution hart and reynolds 1965 and statistical uniformity coefficients bralts et al 1981 the commonly used indicators to describe the kinetic energy includes specific power thompson et al 2001 area based kinetic energy and volume based kinetic energy king and bjorneberg 2010 according to bautista capetillo et al 2012 droplet size and velocity are the main factors affecting the distribution of spray water kinetic energy many studies on the distribution of droplet size and velocity have been carried out and the commonly used methods to measure these two factors include stain method kincaid et al 1996 flour method deboer et al 2001 photography method kinnell 1981 image processing technique salvador et al 2009 and the optical spectropluviometer method montero et al 2003 in recent years the laser precipitation monitor lpm frasson and krajewski 2011 liu et al 2016 and 2d video disdrometer 2dvd ge et al 2016b have been gradually applied to measure sprinkler droplet size and velocity the lpm and 2dvd methods are the most advanced techniques due to their capability to efficiently sample and produce a large amount of data fraile et al 2013 as well as to help determine the role of raindrop impact on splash detachment fernández raga et al 2017 however lpm and 2dvd are too sophisticated and at the present time too expensive to apply to routine studies of soil erosion jayawardena and rezaur 2000 taking physical measurements is not the only way to obtain data on droplet size and velocity application of the ballistic trajectory model can also be an effective method carrión et al 2001 yan et al 2011 although one study has reported that occasionally overestimations of kinetic energy as high as 172 can occur by using this model bautista capetillo et al 2012 spray water kinetic energy and surface soil structure have a close relationship studies by agassi et al 1994 and yan et al 2011 show that soil infiltration rate decreased exponentially with the increase of spray water kinetic energy young and wiersma 1973 reduced the kinetic energy of spray water droplets by 89 without changing the application rate and the amount of soil erosion dropped by more than 90 therefore spray water kinetic energy maybe considered an appropriate indicator for predicting soil erosion shin et al 2015 research to date has concentrated on fixed plate sprinklers yan et al 2011 ouazaa et al 2014 rotating plate sprinklers kohl and deboer 1990 deboer and monnens 2001 and mid sized impact sprinklers sanchez et al 2011 stambouli et al 2014 the study on five types of fixed and rotating plate sprinklers by king and bjorneberg 2010 demonstrated that the conventional thought that sprinkler drop size alone determines kinetic energy transferred to the soil is incorrect sprinklers with the largest drop sizes do not necessarily transfer the greatest kinetic energy to the soil therefore high flow rate gun sprinklers that produce larger droplet sizes than these common sprinkler types may be worth exploring to improve irrigation efficiency while reducing negative consequences such as soil erosion unfortunately few studies have investigated high flow rate gun sprinklers sheikhesmaeili et al 2016 here for the first time we used the 50pyc and hy50 big gun sprinklers to compare their water and kinetic energy distributions under fixed and mobile spraying conditions both sprinklers are widely used in solid set and hose drawn traveler irrigation systems the difference between the two gun sprinklers were summarized to provide guidance for gun type selection and help end users make more informed choices in different operating conditions such as different irrigated crops and soil types these results will also improve our understanding of spray hydraulic performance of vertical impact and turbine drive gun sprinklers 2 material and methods both gun sprinklers were examined under fixed and mobile conditions simulating how they may be applied in the field under the fixed condition a sprinkler was placed in one stationary location and sprayed rotationally while all data were collected under the mobile condition a sprinkler was attached to a hose traveler and the sprinkler rotated periodically while moving in the direction of travel the indexes of spray characteristics determined for the fixed conditions were flow rate sprayed area per unit time radius of throw application rate droplet size and spray kinetic energy the indexes of spray characteristics determined for the mobile conditions were traveling cumulative water depth and traveling cumulative kinetic energy which were calculated according to the models provided by ge et al 2018a 2018b in an additional part of this study two sprinkler guns of each of the same model were placed within various distances of one another to examine effects of various overlapping distances of spray between guns subsequently the changes in soil infiltration rate of the spray water from the two types of sprinkler were compared to determine the potential for promoting surface runoff additional details are described below 2 1 test platform the experiment was carried out in the sprinkler irrigation test site of the agricultural and water saving research institute of china s arid regions a 50pyc vertical impact drive big gun sprinkler tianshui irrigation equipment co ltd jiangsu china and a hy50 turbine drive big gun sprinkler delong irrigation equipment co ltd jiangsu china were tested fig 1 two different diameters of conical nozzles 18 and 20 mm were also used and compared in the sprinkler test a sprinkler was placed 1 7 m above the ground and the spray jet angle was 24 the rotation angle of both gun sprinklers was set to 270 a cyb13i digital pressure sensor 0 1 mpa accuracy 0 1 output signal 4 20 ma current manufactured by xi an xinmin electronic technology co was placed 0 2 m under the nozzle water was supplied from a hydrant and a variable frequency pump was attached to regulate the water head at the inlet of the sprinkler the test pressure ranged from 0 1 to 0 45 mpa with an interval of 0 05 mpa in a leg test of water distribution saretta et al 2018 three lines of catch cans were radially placed along the spray jet with 25 catch cans in each of the three lines and a 2 m distance between each catch can fig 2 a the catch cans used in the test were plastic cylinder barrels with a height of 25 7 cm and inner and outer diameters of 15 2 and 17 cm respectively each test duration was one hour and the weight of water from each catch can was recorded immediately after each test playán et al 2005 the test was carried out in the absence of wind or in light wind speeds of 0 1 5 m s 1 to simulate an indoor test environment thus the effect of wind on spraying pattern was not considered in this study in the radial test of kinetic energy distribution a 2dvd produced by joanneum research corp austria was used to measure droplet diameter and velocity fig 2b diameter and velocity of droplets using the 2dvd were obtained as follows 2 1 1 droplet diameter two orthogonal light sources form two parallel horizontal light planes and the vertical distance between the light planes was 6 2 mm fig 3 the intersection of the two orthogonal light planes determines the virtual area of droplet measurement in the 2dvd 100 mm 100 mm kruger and krajewski 2002 two ccd cameras linearly sweep the test area periodically as water droplets pass through the test area the widths of their shadows are scanned and recorded by the photodetector of the ccd cameras and the shadow widths were used to reconstruct each droplet s shape in two dimensions as shown in fig 3 the shadow width 0 a b c d and e f of a droplet are measured at four time points t1 t2 t3 and t4 respectively as it falls through a light plane the four time points of data taken from each of the two light planes are then used to reconstruct the three dimensional shape of the water droplet as well as estimate its volume thereby calculating the diameter of the sphere with equal volume the test accuracy of droplet size is 0 195 mm kruger and krajewski 2002 2 1 2 droplet velocity the vertical velocity of the water droplet is determined by the time required for the water droplet to pass the distance between the two light planes s 6 2 mm as shown in fig 4 t0 and t2 are the moments when a water droplet enters light planes a and b t1 and t3 are the moments when the water droplets leave light planes a and b and s is the distance between the two light planes thus the vertical velocity of a water droplet is calculated by 1 v v 2 s t 2 t 0 t 3 t 1 a droplet s horizontal velocity was measured similar to that of the vertical velocity the horizontal displacement of the water droplet passing through light planes a and b are sa and sb respectively and the formula for calculating the horizontal velocity is 2 v h s a t 1 t o s b t 3 t 2 2 the combined velocity of a water droplet is determined by the horizontal velocity and vertical velocity 3 v c v v 2 v h 2 the 2dvd was moved along the radial direction of the spray jet and the interval of measurement points was 2 m the 2dvd spent 3 min at each point before being moved to the next point in order to facilitate transfer of the 2dvd between each point we modified the structure of the 2dvd and installed four universal wheels on the support frame so the height from soil to the center of the light plane was 52 cm fig 2b the operating pressures during the kinetic energy test were 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa 2 2 spray characteristic indexes 2 2 1 flow rate and sprayed area per unit time flow rate is an important indicator of sprinkler output and determines the sprayed area per unit time of the sprinkler in this study the flow rate was measured by an emf5000 electronic flow meter fanyang electrical co ltd shanghai china testing scope 0 60 m3 h

radius of throw the sprinkler radius of throw determines the radial application rate defined in the next section and the optimal lane spacing of adjacent sprinklers the radius of throw of a sprinkler also has a direct effect on costs of a sprinkler system tuo et al 2006 according to the asabe standard s398 1 procedure for sprinkler testing and performance reporting the radius of throw is referred to as the distance measured from the sprinkler center line to the farthest point at which the sprinkler deposits water at the minimum rate of 0 26 mm h 1 2 2 3 water application rate the water application rate refers to the depth of sprayed water falling onto a surface per unit of time the point based water application rate focuses on the water received at various points while the average water application rate reflects the average amount of water received across the entire sprayed area the point based water application rate was determined using eq 6 6 p i m a v g i a t where pi is the water application rate at a distance of i from the sprinkler mm h 1 mavg i is the average volume of water in three catch cans at a distance of i from the sprinkler mm3 a is the cross sectional area of a catch can mm2 t is the spray duration h the average water application rate pavg expressed by van der gulik 1989 was adjusted as shown in eq 7 to consider that the rotation angle of our big gun sprinklers was set to 270 7 p a v g 1000 q α 360 π r 2 where q is the flow rate m3 h 1 and r is the radius of throw of a sprinkler m 2 2 4 droplet size spray water is composed of droplets of different sizes and in this study ranged from smaller than 0 5 mm to larger than 6 mm the volume weighted average drop size bautista capetillo et al 2009 was adopted in this study to compare the general distributions of drop sizes of 50pyc and hy50 along the radial direction of spray the volume weighted average drop size was calculated by eq 8 8 d v i 1 n d i 4 i 1 n d i 3 where dv is the volume weighted average drop diameter mm n is the number of droplets and di is the diameter of the ith droplet mm 2 2 5 radial kinetic energy the kinetic energy carried by spray droplets can be calculated on the basis of drop size and velocity measured by the 2dvd as shown in eq 9 9 k e 1 12 π d 3 ρ ω v c 2 where ke is the kinetic energy of the drop j d is the droplet diameter m vc is the combined horizontal and vertical velocities of the droplet m s 1 and ρ w is the mass density of water kg m 3 considering that there are millions of droplets of different sizes and velocities at each point specific power sp j m 2 s 1 was adopted to describe and compare the radial kinetic energy of the two big gun sprinklers the sp of each sprinkler was determined by the following formula king and bjorneberg 2010 10 s p i j 1 n d i k e j 1000 j 1 n d i π d j 3 6 p i 3600 where ndi is the number of drops at the ith location kej is the kinetic energy of the jth drop j dj is the diameter of the

various points in the spray field under moving spray conditions and can be used to evaluate spray uniformity and adequacy of irrigation the model constructed by ge et al 2018b was used to obtain the cumulative water depth for a gun sprinkler under moving spray conditions using the information illustrated in fig 5 and eq 11 to eq 22 in actual working conditions the gun sprinkler attached to a mobile cart rotates periodically while the cart moving in the direction of travel in this study the gun sprinkler was summed as being stationary at point o and the only movement was from the periodic rotating spray around point o point m located at a distance of x from the travel lane moved in the opposite direction of the travel direction and water is received from point mstart to point mend fig 5 the spray area was divided into two regions the semi circular above and the quadrant below the x axis the distances from points m to mend above the x axis and points m to mstart below the x axis in the two regions were lup and ldown respectively and calculated by 11 l u p r 2 x 2 where r is the radius of throw of a sprinkler m and x is the distance between point m and the travel lane m with the cart moving velocity set to be v the rotation cycle to be t and the moving distance of cart in one rotation cycle to be δl lup was divided into n units taking δl as the unit length and each unit was numbered where 12 m l u p δ l 1 for the jth calculation unit the vertical distance from the horizontal coordinate axis to the unit was 13 l v j δ l and the distance from the jth unit to the sprinkler was expressed by 14 l j l v 2 x 2 j δ l 2 x 2 the radial point based application rate was described by a polynomial fit curve 15 p d a i d i where d is the distance from point of measure to the sprinkler m p d is the application rate at the measured point mm h 1 ai is the fitting coefficient and i 0 1 2 6 with j 0 n substituted into the application rate curve it was possible to obtain the application rate at each unit as well as the corresponding time point then it was also possible to obtain a series of p t relationship points accordingly the relationship between the duration of precipitation and application rate could be obtained by creating a polynomial fit to these points as shown in eq 16 16 p t b i t i where t is the point in time of m in the spraying area h p t is the application rate at moment t mm h 1 bi is the fitting coefficient i 0 1 2 6 the cumulative water depth of the upper semicircle could be achieved by integrating the interval of 0 tup with p t 17 d u p x 0 t u p x p t d t where tup x is the length of time for the gun cart to pass through the region above the x axis 18 t u p x r 2 x 2 v the relationship between the precipitation duration and the application rate of point m when passing through the fan shaped spraying area could also be expressed by eq 15 the cumulative water depth ddown x was calculated by eq 19 19 d d o w n x 0 t d o w n x p t d t where tdown x is the length of time for the gun cart to pass through the area below the x axis the equation for tdown x is 20 t d o w n x x tan α 180 2 0 x r cos α 180 2 r 2 x 2 v r cos α 180 2 x r where α is the rotation angle of the sprinkler in degrees the cumulative water depth of point m is then be calculated as 21 d x d u p x d d o w n x the total spray duration of point m is 22 t m t u p x t d o w n x this model was adopted in our study to calculate the traveling cumulative water depth the rotating angle of the sprinkler was set to 270 and the traveling velocity of the sprinkler cart was 20 m h 1 2 2 7 traveling cumulative kinetic energy the expressions to calculate of cumulative kinetic energy sp are similar to those of cumulative water depth except that the radial application rate curve eq 15 was replaced by the expression of radial specific power ge et al 2018a 23 s p d p d μ e q 2 d v 7200 where μeq is the equivalent velocity at the measuring point which was derived from the total kinetic energy and the weight of droplets m s 1 area based kinetic energy kea j m 2 and volume based kinetic energy kev j m 2 mm 1 were adopted as evaluation indicators of cumulative kinetic energy distribution calculation of kea reveals the total energy striking soil surfaces during irrigation eq 24 and kev expresses the kinetic energy per unit volume of applied water eq 25 the equations are as follows 24 k e a m 0 t m s p m t d t 25 k e v m k e a m h m where hm is the spray water depth at the mth location mm 2 2 8 uniformity of overlapping spray distribution in practical applications multiple traveling sprinklers are established to ensure overlap and achieve greater evenness of the spray water distribution under moving spray condition as used here one big gun moved lineally along a travel lane and then was shifted to an adjacent lane at a distance where the spray pattern overlapped that of the previous lane fig 6 the spray uniformity coefficient an important indicator to evaluate the irrigation performance was then determined it is necessary to compare the effect of the overlapping distance on the uniformity of spray the distribution uniformity coefficient dulq recommended by usda burt et al 1997 was adopted and calculated as follows eq 26 26 d u l q d l q d t o t a l where d l q is the depth of water accumulated in that quarter of the field area receiving the smallest depth of accumulation and d t o t a l is the average irrigation depth of the whole spray area two sprinkler guns of the same model were placed at various overlapping spray distances of 0 0 1r 0 2r r r is the corresponding radius of throw under different operating pressures to determine their traveling cumulative water depth from the calculated water depth the distribution uniformity coefficient dulq were determined according to eq 26 2 2 9 influence of spray kinetic energy on infiltration rate the impact on soil surface from irrigation sprinklers due to the kinetic energy of spray can alter surface soil structure and reduce the soil infiltration rate the impact is a primary cause of soil erosion and surface runoff therefore the effects of spray kinetic energy of 50pyc and hy50 on infiltration rate ir in mm h 1 were compared mohammed and kohl 1987 investigated the effect of droplet kinetic energy on infiltration rate with vienna loam soil 43 sand 34 silt and 23 clay the results showed that the key indicators affecting infiltration rate are kea and kev based on the experimental results of mohammed and kohl 1987 ge et al 2018a proposed a mathematical model to calculate infiltration rates based on kea and kev as shown in eq 27 in this study ge et al s 2018a model was adopted to simulate infiltration rates values obtained for the kinetic energy of 50pyc and hy50 gun sprinklers it should be noted that the data source of the model was derived from experiments conducted by mohammed and kohl 1987 therefore this model may be only applicable to the specific type of soil used in their study 27 ir 147 1 k e v 12 2 k e a 135 8 34 1 113 1 k e a 135 8 375 2 k e v 12 2 k e a 135 8 113 34 1 1 k e v 12 2 17 7 2 k e v 12 2 k e a 135 8

increase of working pressure and greater nozzle diameter fig 7 the flow rates of 50pyc and hy50 increased by 16 6 19 4 and 20 2 21 4 for the respective nozzle diameters of 18 mm and 20 mm used with either sprinkler across the various operating pressures with any combination of the two sprinkler types and two nozzle sizes the flow rate increases logarithmically with increasing operating pressure the flow rates of 50pyc and hy50 were similar at the same operation pressure by substituting flow rate in eq 4 for the two sprinklers the sprayed area per unit time of 50pyc and hy50 under different pressures and nozzle diameters were calculated the following values for effective utilization factor of working hours irrigation efficiency and irrigation depth of 0 9 75 and 20 mm respectively were used in the calculations the sprayed area per unit time of 50pyc and hy50 varied from 467 1000 m2 h 1 18 mm nozzle diameter and 533 1200 m2 h 1 20 mm nozzle diameter under the operating pressure of 0 1 0 5 mpa 3 2 radius of throw the radius of throw of 50pyc and hy50 under different operating pressures are shown in fig 8 the geometric logarithms of radius of throw increased with increasing operating pressures the radius of throw of hy50 was generally higher than that of 50pyc with a difference of approximately 8 1 to 21 9 this phenomenon can be explained by two aspects 1 the difference in the mechanical structures of the vertical impact and turbine drive gun sprinklers and 2 the variation of rotation speed the structure of the 50pyc sprinkler caused the main water jet to strike the deflector directly resulting in large disturbances of the jet stream of water and thus relatively high energy loss in contrast the main water jet of the hy50 received relatively less interference despite the presence of a water breaker the driving force that drives the sprinkler to rotate comes from water shooting from a secondary nozzle the variation in rotation speed also contributes to the difference in radius of throw the radius of throw decreased greatly with the increase of rotation speed li et al 2014 the test results of this study show that the rotating speed of 50pyc reached up to 0 86 1 5 r min while the rotating speed of hy50 varied from 0 12 to 0 6 r min table 1 the rotating speed of 50pyc was always higher than that of hy50 3 3 water application rate significant differences were observed in radial application rates between the two spray guns at different working pressures fig 9 the radial water distribution of 50pyc primarily appeared in a unimodal distribution with the peak point close to the sprinkler the peak values of application rate at working pressures of 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa were 17 1 16 4 15 6 and 16 7 mm h 1 respectively the working pressure had little effect on the peak value of application rate by contrast the radial application rate of hy50 changed gradually from a unimodal distribution to a biomodal distribution with the increase of working pressure the peak value of application rate was located near the perimeter of the radius of throw the application rate peaked at 25 8 16 5 12 0 and 11 2 mm h 1 under respective working pressures of 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa moreover the peak value of application rate decreased rapidly with the increase of working pressure the difference in radial application rate can also be attributed to the different rotational mechanisms between sprinkler types the main jet of 50pyc was perturbed by the spray arm resulting in a concentrated distribution of water nearest the sprinkler in contrast the spray jet of hy50 was not perturbed thus the spray water concentrated near the perimeter of the spray range under low working pressure however as the working pressure increased the degree of destabilization of the spray jet increased numerous small sized droplets appeared near the sprinkler which lead to an increase in the amount of irrigation water at that location as a result the distribution of the radial application rate transformed from a unimodal into a saddle shaped distribution fig 9 the average application rates of 50pyc and hy50 were calculated by eq 7 and can be viewed in fig 10 average application rates of both 50pyc and hy50 gun sprinkler clearly decreased as the operating pressure increased this is likely due to the greater increase in spray control area in the denominator of eq 7 causing the average application rate to decrease accordingly despite the rising flow rates with the increase of operating pressure consistent flow rates and the difference between throw radii may have contributed to the significantly lower average application rate of hy50 than that of 50pyc with a nozzle diameter of 18 mm the average application rate of hy50 was 14 6 35 9 lower than that of 50pyc with nozzle diameter of 20 mm the average application rate of hy50 was 11 27 2 lower than that of 50pyc excessive water application rate may lead to surface ponding and runoff and can exacerbate soil erosion and induce formation of surface crust in contrast low water application rate can result in an insufficient supply of water per unit of time and thus require longer working hours of the irrigation machine to compensate for the insufficient supply the point based application rate pi and the average application rate pavg play different roles in practical use pi is important for calculating spraying uniformity and pavg is used to design sprinkler irrigation systems sometimes pi is used as an indicator of local surface ponding 3 4 droplet size the volume weighted average drop sizes of 50pyc and hy50 under different operating pressures are shown in fig 11 droplet diameter increased exponentially with distance from the sprinkler which this founding was consistent with the results of chen and wallender 1985 however the sprinklers of interest in their study were mid sized impact sprinklers and fixed plate spray nozzles meanwhile the volume weighted average drop size at the same distance from the sprinkler decreased with increasing operating pressures which verified the conclusion of montero et al 2003 that working pressure is the main factor affecting droplet size distribution of the sprinkler the volume weighted average diameters of 50pyc near the perimeter of the radius of throw under operating pressures of 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa were 3 1 2 7 2 8 and 3 0 mm respectively while the diameters of hy50 were 3 5 3 3 3 1 and 3 6 mm respectively the droplet sizes of the hy50 sprinkler were clearly bigger which was likely due to the fact that the main jet from the principal nozzle from the hy50 sprinkler was not disturbed while the jet of the main nozzle from 50pyc sprinkler strikes directly with the impact arm the impact of 50pyc sprinkler breaks down the jet in drops also the energy losses due to the impact of the drive arm on the jet likely reduced its kinetic energy and thus decreased its radius of throw furthermore the difference of droplet size likely contributed to the difference of hydraulic performance between the two gun sprinklers droplets of smaller size are susceptible to wind drift and evaporation causing greater water loss dechmi et al 2003 molle et al 2012 however large droplets carry higher kinetic energy which intensifies their impact and compaction on the soil exacerbating adverse effects such as soil erosion and surface runoff king and bjorneberg 2010 the effect of nozzle diameter on the distribution of droplet size is shown in fig 12 considering the influence of test accuracy 0 195 mm on the results of small droplet sizes close to the sprinkler the sizes of water droplets over 6 m away from the sprinkler were compared for the 50pyc spray gun fig 12a the volume weighted average drop size showed slight increases in size with the increase in nozzle diameter from 18 mm to 20 mm the increasing rates were lower than 10 the variation of droplet size in response to the change of nozzle diameter for hy50 remained nearly the same as that of 50pyc the volume weighted average diameter increased by 15 when the diameter of nozzle changed from 18 mm to 20 mm in general with the increase of nozzle diameter both the radius of throw and the volume weighted average diameter of the vertical impact spray gun and turbine spray gun increased accordingly 3 5 radial kinetic energy the radial specific power of 50pyc and hy50 were calculated based on the droplet diameter and velocity of droplets at each sampling point fig 13 there was a significant difference in distributions of radial specific power between the two spray guns the specific power distribution of 50pyc transformed from a triangle to saddle like shape when the operating pressure increased from 0 15 mpa to 0 45 mpa the peak value of specific power was measured at the outer end of the radius of throw the peak values reached 0 074 0 046 0 057 and 0 040 j m 2 s 1 under the pressures 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa respectively indicating no significant change with the increase of working pressure in contrast the radial specific power of hy50 consistently presented a triangular distribution with the changes in operating pressure the peak value of specific power was also measured at the outer end of the spray zone however the peak values were significantly higher than those of 50pyc reaching 0 2 0 1 0 084 and 0 069 j m 2 s 1 under 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa respectively the peak value of specific power decreased with the increase of operating pressure notably the radial distribution pattern of specific power of 50pyc differed greatly from the radial distribution pattern of application rate as illustrated in fig 6 the radial application rate of 50pyc decreased with increasing distance from the sprinkler and the peak value of application rate occurred at a distance close to the sprinkler moreover the peak value of specific power occurred at the outer end of the spray wet zone fig 13 the peak values of application rate and specific power in relation to distances from the sprinkler under different operating pressures for both the 50pyc and hy50 spray guns are summarized in table 2 the recorded distance of the peak value of the specific power of 50pyc was located within 70 80 of the radius of throw while the distance of the peak value of the radial application rate was located within 10 30 of the radius of throw by contrast the peak points of application rate and specific power for hy50 were almost overlapping occurring at approximately 65 85 of the distance of its radius of throw these results show that high radial application rate does not indicate high spray kinetic energy for instance the highest radial application rate of 50pyc appeared near the sprinkler however the water at this location was mostly impact dissipated by the baffles and the stream was fully broken the sizes of the droplets were relatively small and the speeds of the droplets were low therefore this section of spray water carried a limited amount of kinetic energy the spray kinetic energy was not determined simply by the droplet size and velocity fig 11 shows that the size of water droplets were largest at the farthest end of the spray range and the water droplet velocity was positively correlated with particle size of droplets ge et al 2018b however the highest value of the specific power was not at the outermost end of the spray control area fig 13 although the droplet size and velocity reach their maximums at the outer end the rapid decrease of sprinkler application rate leads to the decrease of specific power the specific power peaks only when the droplet size velocity and application rate are maintained at a high levels the experimental results also indicate that the peak value points of spray kinetic energy of both 50pyc and hy50 were consistently observed within 65 85 of the radius of throw 3 6 traveling cumulative water depth the cumulative spray water depth was calculated based on the radial application rate and the corresponding operating parameters the cumulative depth of irrigation water perpendicular to the travel lane of the two spray guns initially increased and subsequently decreased with increasing distance from the travel lane displaying a parabolic distribution the sprayed water depth of 50pyc near the travel lane was significantly higher than that of the hy50 spray gun the maximum irrigation depth under the operating pressures of 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa for the 50pyc spray gun were 19 9 20 8 23 3 and 23 9 mm respectively while the maximum irrigation depths for the hy50 spray gun were 20 7 16 8 21 9 and 20 8 mm respectively overall hy50 depths were lower than that of 50pyc the average application rate at each point perpendicular to the travel lane during the irrigation process was obtained by dividing the cumulative depth by the spray duration as shown in fig 14 there was a significant difference in the average application rate between 50pyc and hy50 under mobile spray conditions for the 50pyc vertical impact gun sprinkler the average application rate decreased with the increase in distance from the travel lane and the peak values of application rate were 13 4 11 6 9 5 and 10 6 mm h 1 under the respective operating pressures of 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa in contrast for the hy50 turbine drive gun sprinkler the average application rate transformed from a donut shape to a flat trapezoid distribution with the increase in operating pressures of 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa the peak values of application rate at each pressure value were 13 8 7 1 7 4 and 6 1 mm h 1 respectively the application rate under the mobile spraying system was relatively lower for hy50 which can be attributed to the larger radius of throw as well as the longer spray duration at each data sampling point 3 7 traveling cumulative kinetic energy the measured radial spray kinetic energy of 50pyc and hy50 were substituted into the calculation model proposed by ge et al 2018a to obtain the traveling cumulative kinetic energy kea the results are shown in fig 15 for 18 mm nozzle diameter spray guns similar to the distribution of cumulative water depth the cumulative kinetic energy perpendicular to the travel lane increased and then decreased with increasing distance from the travel lane showing a parabolic distribution generally the cumulative kinetic energy of hy50 was higher than that of 50pyc the peak values of kinetic energy of 50pyc were 446 404 553 and 389 j m 2 under the respective operating pressures of 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa for the hy50 gun sprinkler the peak values of kinetic energy were 781 475 630 and 572 j m 2 respectively for the same amount of spray water the kinetic energy of hy50 was 1 5 2 4 times that of 50pyc the volume based kinetic energy kev at each point perpendicular to the travel lane during the irrigation process was obtained by dividing the cumulative kinetic energy by the cumulative water depth fig 15 the volume based kinetic energy of both spray guns increased with increasing distance from the travel lane in most spray areas the volume based kinetic energy of spray water of hy50 was higher than that of 50pyc the peak values of volume based kinetic energy of 50pyc were 32 2 37 1 37 7 and 30 9 j m 2 mm 1 under the operating pressures of 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa respectively while of the hy50 spray gun these peak values were 44 3 51 7 47 8 and 54 3 j m 2 mm 1 respectively there are various indicators to describe the sprinkler kinetic energy according to previous studies the two indicators kea and kev can effectively predict and evaluate the infiltration rate and soil erosion caused by the kinetic energy of sprinkler precipitation for instance mohammed and kohl 1987 analyzed the effects of changes in kea and kev on infiltration rate kea was thought to be the direct cause of breakdown of surface exposed aggregates while the value of kev determines the thickness of surface seal layer the model constructed by ge et al 2018a to calculate infiltration rate well supported this view according to the model when kev is greater than 12 2 j m 2 mm 1 and kea is greater than 135 8 j m 2 the infiltration rate decreases with increases of kev and kea according to agassi et al s 1994 study the major decrease in final infiltration rate was already achieved at a kev lower than10 j m 2 mm 1 in addition wash erosion and splash erosion is largely attributable to the value of kev wash erosion increased exponentially with the increase in kev and splash erosion increased linearly with the increase in kev agassi et al 1994 where kev was greater than 16 j m 2 mm 1 wash erosion increased sharply with an increase in kev according to the fig 15 the overall kev and kea of hy50 were higher than those of 50pyc indicating a greater risk of the breakdown of surface exposed aggregates thicker soil crusts and more soil erosion 3 8 uniformity of overlapping spray distribution fig 16 presents the distribution of uniformity coefficients of 18 mm nozzle diameter 50pyc and hy50 under different operating pressures and overlapping distances the distribution of uniformity coefficients of both gun sprinklers increased and then decreased with increasing overlapping distance of the coverage area of spray water and under different operating pressures the traveling cumulative water depth perpendicular to the travel lane of the two spray guns showed a parabolic distribution fig 14 and the irrigation depth was lower at the outer end of the spray range however with overlapping spray by multiple sprinklers the water deficient edges received supplemental watering by the neighboring sprinkler and thus irrigation depth at points furthest from each sprinkler became more uniform as the overlapping distance increased water depth rose sharply in the overlapping areas and presented a unimodal distribution the water distribution became uneven and the distribution uniformity coefficient decreased accordingly for the 50pyc spray gun the highest values of distribution uniformity coefficients under the respective operating pressures 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa were 80 5 85 6 82 2 and 87 8 respectively and the corresponding overlapping distances were 0 3r 0 5r 0 5r and 0 5r for the hy50 spray gun the highest values of distribution uniformity coefficients under the four operating pressures were respectively 67 1 75 8 76 9 and 75 7 at the overlapping distances 0 1r 0 2r 0 3r and 0 5r fig 16 shows that the pair of 50pyc gun sprinklers obtained higher spray distribution coefficients than that of the hy50 pair however un sprayed areas is an important problem when the overlap distance is small for instance the distribution uniformity coefficients of 50pyc at 0 25 and 0 35 mpa were only 29 7 and 26 4 with an overlap distance of 0 by contrast the distribution uniformity coefficients of hy50 were 50 3 and 43 6 under the same conditions based on results of the sprinkler operating pressure radius of throw and spray uniformity coefficient the optimal distance of overlapping spray area for 50pyc under different pressures 0 15 0 45 mpa was 34 50 m while for hy50 the optimal distance of overlapping spray area at 0 15 to 0 45 mpa was 41 63 m in comparing the two gun sprinklers the suitable overlapping distances for the two sprinklers are the same to a large extent however because the radius of throw for hy50 was 8 1 21 9 greater than that of 50pyc the overlapping spray distance of hy50 was higher than that of 50pyc thus for instance under the operating pressure of 0 25 mpa the overlapping distance between sprinklers of hy50 was 54 8 m while that of 50pyc was 37 5 m this suggests that implementation of the hy50 gun sprinkler would require fewer auxiliary facilities in the field such as hydrants and travel lanes which can reduce the total costs of establishing an irrigation system in addition the total time required to implement a hose drawn traveler irrigator equipped with the hy50 gun sprinkler would be lower than the time needed to implement the same irrigation system with the 50pyc and ultimately increase irrigation area per unit time 3 9 influence of spray kinetic energy on infiltration rate the area based kinetic energy and volume based kinetic energy of 50pyc and hy50 were substituted into the above model and the infiltration rate after one session of spraying under different operating pressures were calculated and presented in fig 17 it should be noted that in mohammed and kohl s 1987 the maximum value of kev was 24 4 j m 2 mm 1 while in our study kev of 50pyc and hy50 ranged from 11 3 63 9 j m 2 mm 1 it was assumed the calculation model was still valid to facilitate the comparative analysis of two spray guns the infiltration rate of each sampling point perpendicular to the travel lane initially decreased and then increased with increasing distance from the lane under the mobile spray conditions the decrease in infiltration rate of the hy50 spray gun was greater than that of the 50pyc spray gun the greatest drops in infiltration rates from 50pyc under the four operating pressures were to 41 4 86 7 mm h 1 32 1 99 9 mm h 1 51 7 71 mm h 1 and 27 2 107 1 mm h 1 of the initial infiltration rate the lowest values of infiltration rate of hy50 were 37 3 77 2 55 2 and 63 8 mm h 1 under the respective four pressures and amounted to 74 6 47 5 62 5 and 56 6 of the initial infiltration rate respectively these results indicate that surface ponding is more likely to occur with the hy50 sprayer than the 50pyc sprayer if the same amount of water is applied when designing an irrigation system often application rate is the factor that designers consider above all others in selecting a sprinkler unit because of the magnitude of impact that application rate may have on crops and soil surfaces however our results suggest that the lower application rate of hy50 is not a good indicator of milder impacts and that the amount of kinetic energy carried by spray water also plays an important role in the interaction between the spray water and their infiltration rates in soils the benefits associated with lower application rate may be negated by the higher kinetic energy and lower infiltration rate which often increases the formation of surface seal and runoff 4 conclusions two typical large volume gun sprinklers 50pyc vertical impact and hy50 turbine drive have wide applications in industrial dust removal and agricultural irrigation the market price of the two sprinklers are equivalent approximately 2000 yuan each 300 us dollars due to the limited knowledge of hydraulic performance of vertical impact and turbine drive big gun sprinklers it is difficult to select between the two gun sprinklers simply based on the basic hydraulic parameters e g flow rate provided by the manufacturer in this study the spray characteristics of 50pyc and hy50 under stationary and mobile spray conditions were empirically compared and analyzed with model calculations due to the different rotation mechanism of the two gun sprinklers the main spray jet of 50pyc was heavily disturbed while the main spray jet of hy50 was not this resulted in significant differences in the radius of throw droplet size water distribution and kinetic energy distribution between the two gun sprinklers under the working pressure of 0 15 0 45 mpa the radius of throw of hy50 was 8 1 21 9 bigger than that of 50pyc and the volume weighted droplet size of hy50 was 7 8 21 7 greater than that of 50pyc the average application rate of hy50 was 11 0 35 9 lower than that of 50pyc however the peak value of specific power of hy50 was 1 5 2 7 times that of 50pyc and the cumulative kinetic energy of hy50 was 1 5 2 4 times that of 50pyc the differences in the hydraulic performance of the 50pyc and hy50 gun sprinklers implies different effects in the field the spray water of 50pyc was more evenly distributed with the highest values of distribution uniformity coefficients that were 5 3 13 5 higher than values of hy50 more evenly disributed water is more conducive to increasing crop yield and water use efficiency meanwhile the larger radius of throw of hy50 would require fewer auxiliary facilities such as hydrants and travel lanes as well as less ineffective time which brings more savings in terms of capital investment and labor cost in addition the overall kev and kea of hy50 were higher than those of 50pyc indicating a higher risk of breakdown of surface exposed aggregates and thicker soil crusts thus the benefits associated with lower application rate would ne negated by the higher kinetic energy and lower infiltration rate which often increases the formation of surface seal and runoff in conclusion this empirical study highlights the differences in spray hydraulic performance between a typical vertical impact drive gun sprinkler and a typical turbine drive gun sprinkler soil and crop types irrigation water quality and economic and labor costs should also be taken into consideration when selecting between the two gun sprinklers in order to

10787,vertical impact and turbine drive sprinklers are the most widely used high volume sprinklers with both solid set spray and hose drawn traveler irrigator systems different mechanical structures and driving modes between the two types of sprinklers will inevitably lead to differences in spray performance which may affect the adaptability of each sprinkler thus far there are few comparative studies that have quantitatively analyzed the spray characteristics of the two types of gun sprinklers resulting in the lack of guidance in sprinkler type selection for both sprinkler system designers and farmers in this paper the vertical impact drive gun sprinkler 50pyc and turbine drive gun sprinkler hy50 were used to conduct a comparative analysis of water distribution and kinetic energy distribution between these two commonly used sprinklers the results show that the average radial application rate of 50pyc was 11 0 35 9 higher than that of hy50 under fixed spray conditions under mobile spray conditions the water distribution of the two gun sprinklers initially increased and then decreased as the distance from the travel lane increased exhibiting a unimodal distribution both the cumulative irrigation depth and average radial application rate of 50pyc were significantly higher than those of hy50 in the spray area close to the travel lane under overlapping spraying conditions using two adjacent sprinklers of the same type various working pressures and different spacing between sprinklers the maximum distribution uniformity coefficients of the 50pyc gun sprinkler reached 80 5 to 87 8 while the maximum distribution uniformity coefficients of the hy50 gun sprinkler were approximately 67 1 to 76 9 5 3 to 13 5 lower than that of 50pyc under fixed spray conditions the peak values of spray kinetic energy of the turbine drive hy50 was about 1 5 2 7 times that of the 50pyc gun sprinkler under different working pressures under mobile spray conditions the cumulative kinetic energy in the whole spray area of the hy50 gun sprinkler was about 1 5 2 4 times that of the 50pyc gun sprinkler this quantitative study on two common types of sprinkler guns vertical impact and turbine drive sprinklers indicates that to comprehensively obtain greater irrigation benefits soil and crop types irrigation water quality and economic and labor costs should also be taken into consideration when selecting between the two gun sprinklers keywords vertical impact drive turbine drive high volume sprinkler application rate kinetic energy 1 introduction big gun sprinklers have been widely used in agricultural irrigation due to their advantages of high flow rate generally higher than 5 l s 1 wide spray area and high flexibility especially in combination with a hose drawn traveler irrigator ge et al 2018a as the chinese government has continuously increased investment on high efficiency water saving irrigation projects nearly 1 4 million hectares of arable land will be implemented with sprinkler irrigation systems during the 13th five year plan 2016 2020 consequently a vast number of high volume sprinklers vertical impact or turbine drive models have been applied in agricultural production the respective 50pyc and hy50 models are the typical vertical impact and turbine drive gun sprinklers used in china tang et al 2016 in 2015 the numbers of these two kinds of sprinklers put into production exceeded 20 000 zhang 2016 although 50pyc and hy50 both fall into the category of high flow rate sprinklers keller and bliesner 1990 there is a significant difference in the driving mechanism that rotates each of the two sprinklers fig 1 the vertical impact sprinkler 50pyc rotates by virtue of the reaction force from the water jet and the actuator includes a vertical swing rocker a reaction shovel and a balance weight on the other hand in the turbine drive sprinkler hy50 a stream of water ejected from a secondary nozzle impacts the turbine and drives the transmission mechanism to rotate the sprinkler due to the high impact speed of the water jet the rotating speed of the impeller can reach up to 2000 r min 1 unfortunately there are few reports on the spray hydraulic characteristics of the two gun sprinklers and whether the difference of spray performance affects the environments in which the sprinklers are applied therefore it is common to find potential users getting confused in selecting between the two types of gun sprinklers in addition the manufacturers are also unable to provide effective guidance in selection thus it was necessary to carry out this comparative study to provide practical information to sprinkler system designers and users on the selection of gun sprinkler type for the purpose of irrigation quality improvement according to the american society of civil engineers asce irrigation efficiency and uniformity are the key indicators in the evaluation of irrigation quality burt et al 1997 the higher the irrigation efficiency the lower the amount of irrigation water should be consumed irrigation uniformity relates closely to crop yield mantovani et al 1995 surface runoff bernuth 1983 deep percolation of water and nutrient leaching vories and bernuth 1986 uneven water distribution contributes to the waste of both water and energy consumption ascough et al 2002 irrigation efficiency and uniformity of big gun sprinklers remain at low levels in all kinds of sprinklers systems rolim and teixeira 2016 the irrigation efficiency of big gun sprinklers is 58 according to the bc sprinkler irrigation manual vander 1989 the water distribution uniformity of hose drawn travelers is only 62 according to the test results of wigginton and raine 2001 there are many factors that affect irrigation uniformity and efficiency of big gun sprinklers the most direct factors are the distribution of water application and kinetic energy of droplets from the big gun sprinklers the water distribution of a big gun sprinkler depends on sprinkler type flow rate working pressure as well as the radiation angle and overlapping spray distance under traveling spray conditions ge et al 2016a commonly used spray uniformity coefficients include the christiansen christiansen 1942 distribution hart and reynolds 1965 and statistical uniformity coefficients bralts et al 1981 the commonly used indicators to describe the kinetic energy includes specific power thompson et al 2001 area based kinetic energy and volume based kinetic energy king and bjorneberg 2010 according to bautista capetillo et al 2012 droplet size and velocity are the main factors affecting the distribution of spray water kinetic energy many studies on the distribution of droplet size and velocity have been carried out and the commonly used methods to measure these two factors include stain method kincaid et al 1996 flour method deboer et al 2001 photography method kinnell 1981 image processing technique salvador et al 2009 and the optical spectropluviometer method montero et al 2003 in recent years the laser precipitation monitor lpm frasson and krajewski 2011 liu et al 2016 and 2d video disdrometer 2dvd ge et al 2016b have been gradually applied to measure sprinkler droplet size and velocity the lpm and 2dvd methods are the most advanced techniques due to their capability to efficiently sample and produce a large amount of data fraile et al 2013 as well as to help determine the role of raindrop impact on splash detachment fernández raga et al 2017 however lpm and 2dvd are too sophisticated and at the present time too expensive to apply to routine studies of soil erosion jayawardena and rezaur 2000 taking physical measurements is not the only way to obtain data on droplet size and velocity application of the ballistic trajectory model can also be an effective method carrión et al 2001 yan et al 2011 although one study has reported that occasionally overestimations of kinetic energy as high as 172 can occur by using this model bautista capetillo et al 2012 spray water kinetic energy and surface soil structure have a close relationship studies by agassi et al 1994 and yan et al 2011 show that soil infiltration rate decreased exponentially with the increase of spray water kinetic energy young and wiersma 1973 reduced the kinetic energy of spray water droplets by 89 without changing the application rate and the amount of soil erosion dropped by more than 90 therefore spray water kinetic energy maybe considered an appropriate indicator for predicting soil erosion shin et al 2015 research to date has concentrated on fixed plate sprinklers yan et al 2011 ouazaa et al 2014 rotating plate sprinklers kohl and deboer 1990 deboer and monnens 2001 and mid sized impact sprinklers sanchez et al 2011 stambouli et al 2014 the study on five types of fixed and rotating plate sprinklers by king and bjorneberg 2010 demonstrated that the conventional thought that sprinkler drop size alone determines kinetic energy transferred to the soil is incorrect sprinklers with the largest drop sizes do not necessarily transfer the greatest kinetic energy to the soil therefore high flow rate gun sprinklers that produce larger droplet sizes than these common sprinkler types may be worth exploring to improve irrigation efficiency while reducing negative consequences such as soil erosion unfortunately few studies have investigated high flow rate gun sprinklers sheikhesmaeili et al 2016 here for the first time we used the 50pyc and hy50 big gun sprinklers to compare their water and kinetic energy distributions under fixed and mobile spraying conditions both sprinklers are widely used in solid set and hose drawn traveler irrigation systems the difference between the two gun sprinklers were summarized to provide guidance for gun type selection and help end users make more informed choices in different operating conditions such as different irrigated crops and soil types these results will also improve our understanding of spray hydraulic performance of vertical impact and turbine drive gun sprinklers 2 material and methods both gun sprinklers were examined under fixed and mobile conditions simulating how they may be applied in the field under the fixed condition a sprinkler was placed in one stationary location and sprayed rotationally while all data were collected under the mobile condition a sprinkler was attached to a hose traveler and the sprinkler rotated periodically while moving in the direction of travel the indexes of spray characteristics determined for the fixed conditions were flow rate sprayed area per unit time radius of throw application rate droplet size and spray kinetic energy the indexes of spray characteristics determined for the mobile conditions were traveling cumulative water depth and traveling cumulative kinetic energy which were calculated according to the models provided by ge et al 2018a 2018b in an additional part of this study two sprinkler guns of each of the same model were placed within various distances of one another to examine effects of various overlapping distances of spray between guns subsequently the changes in soil infiltration rate of the spray water from the two types of sprinkler were compared to determine the potential for promoting surface runoff additional details are described below 2 1 test platform the experiment was carried out in the sprinkler irrigation test site of the agricultural and water saving research institute of china s arid regions a 50pyc vertical impact drive big gun sprinkler tianshui irrigation equipment co ltd jiangsu china and a hy50 turbine drive big gun sprinkler delong irrigation equipment co ltd jiangsu china were tested fig 1 two different diameters of conical nozzles 18 and 20 mm were also used and compared in the sprinkler test a sprinkler was placed 1 7 m above the ground and the spray jet angle was 24 the rotation angle of both gun sprinklers was set to 270 a cyb13i digital pressure sensor 0 1 mpa accuracy 0 1 output signal 4 20 ma current manufactured by xi an xinmin electronic technology co was placed 0 2 m under the nozzle water was supplied from a hydrant and a variable frequency pump was attached to regulate the water head at the inlet of the sprinkler the test pressure ranged from 0 1 to 0 45 mpa with an interval of 0 05 mpa in a leg test of water distribution saretta et al 2018 three lines of catch cans were radially placed along the spray jet with 25 catch cans in each of the three lines and a 2 m distance between each catch can fig 2 a the catch cans used in the test were plastic cylinder barrels with a height of 25 7 cm and inner and outer diameters of 15 2 and 17 cm respectively each test duration was one hour and the weight of water from each catch can was recorded immediately after each test playán et al 2005 the test was carried out in the absence of wind or in light wind speeds of 0 1 5 m s 1 to simulate an indoor test environment thus the effect of wind on spraying pattern was not considered in this study in the radial test of kinetic energy distribution a 2dvd produced by joanneum research corp austria was used to measure droplet diameter and velocity fig 2b diameter and velocity of droplets using the 2dvd were obtained as follows 2 1 1 droplet diameter two orthogonal light sources form two parallel horizontal light planes and the vertical distance between the light planes was 6 2 mm fig 3 the intersection of the two orthogonal light planes determines the virtual area of droplet measurement in the 2dvd 100 mm 100 mm kruger and krajewski 2002 two ccd cameras linearly sweep the test area periodically as water droplets pass through the test area the widths of their shadows are scanned and recorded by the photodetector of the ccd cameras and the shadow widths were used to reconstruct each droplet s shape in two dimensions as shown in fig 3 the shadow width 0 a b c d and e f of a droplet are measured at four time points t1 t2 t3 and t4 respectively as it falls through a light plane the four time points of data taken from each of the two light planes are then used to reconstruct the three dimensional shape of the water droplet as well as estimate its volume thereby calculating the diameter of the sphere with equal volume the test accuracy of droplet size is 0 195 mm kruger and krajewski 2002 2 1 2 droplet velocity the vertical velocity of the water droplet is determined by the time required for the water droplet to pass the distance between the two light planes s 6 2 mm as shown in fig 4 t0 and t2 are the moments when a water droplet enters light planes a and b t1 and t3 are the moments when the water droplets leave light planes a and b and s is the distance between the two light planes thus the vertical velocity of a water droplet is calculated by 1 v v 2 s t 2 t 0 t 3 t 1 a droplet s horizontal velocity was measured similar to that of the vertical velocity the horizontal displacement of the water droplet passing through light planes a and b are sa and sb respectively and the formula for calculating the horizontal velocity is 2 v h s a t 1 t o s b t 3 t 2 2 the combined velocity of a water droplet is determined by the horizontal velocity and vertical velocity 3 v c v v 2 v h 2 the 2dvd was moved along the radial direction of the spray jet and the interval of measurement points was 2 m the 2dvd spent 3 min at each point before being moved to the next point in order to facilitate transfer of the 2dvd between each point we modified the structure of the 2dvd and installed four universal wheels on the support frame so the height from soil to the center of the light plane was 52 cm fig 2b the operating pressures during the kinetic energy test were 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa 2 2 spray characteristic indexes 2 2 1 flow rate and sprayed area per unit time flow rate is an important indicator of sprinkler output and determines the sprayed area per unit time of the sprinkler in this study the flow rate was measured by an emf5000 electronic flow meter fanyang electrical co ltd shanghai china testing scope 0 60 m3 h

irrigation efficiency of the irrigation system and kb is the effective utilization factor of working hours 5 k b t s p r a y t s p r a y t t r a n s t u n c o i l where tspray is the time a sprinkler was actually spraying water h ttrans is the time needed to transfer the entire irrigation system from one point to the next point h tuncoil is the time needed to uncoil the traveler hose h 2 2 2 radius of throw the sprinkler radius of throw determines the radial application rate defined in the next section and the optimal lane spacing of adjacent sprinklers the radius of throw of a sprinkler also has a direct effect on costs of a sprinkler system tuo et al 2006 according to the asabe standard s398 1 procedure for sprinkler testing and performance reporting the radius of throw is referred to as the distance measured from the sprinkler center line to the farthest point at which the sprinkler deposits water at the minimum rate of 0 26 mm h 1 2 2 3 water application rate the water application rate refers to the depth of sprayed water falling onto a surface per unit of time the point based water application rate focuses on the water received at various points while the average water application rate reflects the average amount of water received across the entire sprayed area the point based water application rate was determined using eq 6 6 p i m a v g i a t where pi is the water application rate at a distance of i from the sprinkler mm h 1 mavg i is the average volume of water in three catch cans at a distance of i from the sprinkler mm3 a is the cross sectional area of a catch can mm2 t is the spray duration h the average water application rate pavg expressed by van der gulik 1989 was adjusted as shown in eq 7 to consider that the rotation angle of our big gun sprinklers was set to 270 7 p a v g 1000 q α 360 π r 2 where q is the flow rate m3 h 1 and r is the radius of throw of a sprinkler m 2 2 4 droplet size spray water is composed of droplets of different sizes and in this study ranged from smaller than 0 5 mm to larger than 6 mm the volume weighted average drop size bautista capetillo et al 2009 was adopted in this study to compare the general distributions of drop sizes of 50pyc and hy50 along the radial direction of spray the volume weighted average drop size was calculated by eq 8 8 d v i 1 n d i 4 i 1 n d i 3 where dv is the volume weighted average drop diameter mm n is the number of droplets and di is the diameter of the ith droplet mm 2 2 5 radial kinetic energy the kinetic energy carried by spray droplets can be calculated on the basis of drop size and velocity measured by the 2dvd as shown in eq 9 9 k e 1 12 π d 3 ρ ω v c 2 where ke is the kinetic energy of the drop j d is the droplet diameter m vc is the combined horizontal and vertical velocities of the droplet m s 1 and ρ w is the mass density of water kg m 3 considering that there are millions of droplets of different sizes and velocities at each point specific power sp j m 2 s 1 was adopted to describe and compare the radial kinetic energy of the two big gun sprinklers the sp of each sprinkler was determined by the following formula king and bjorneberg 2010 10 s p i j 1 n d i k e j 1000 j 1 n d i π d j 3 6 p i 3600 where ndi is the number of drops at the ith location kej is the kinetic energy of the jth drop j dj is the diameter of the jth drop m pi is the application rate at distance i from the sprinkler mm h 1 2 2 6 traveling cumulative water depth the traveling cumulative water depth reflects the actual irrigation depth at various points in the spray field under moving spray conditions and can be used to evaluate spray uniformity and adequacy of irrigation the model constructed by ge et al 2018b was used to obtain the cumulative water depth for a gun sprinkler under moving spray conditions using the information illustrated in fig 5 and eq 11 to eq 22 in actual working conditions the gun sprinkler attached to a mobile cart rotates periodically while the cart moving in the direction of travel in this study the gun sprinkler was summed as being stationary at point o and the only movement was from the periodic rotating spray around point o point m located at a distance of x from the travel lane moved in the opposite direction of the travel direction and water is received from point mstart to point mend fig 5 the spray area was divided into two regions the semi circular above and the quadrant below the x axis the distances from points m to mend above the x axis and points m to mstart below the x axis in the two regions were lup and ldown respectively and calculated by 11 l u p r 2 x 2 where r is the radius of throw of a sprinkler m and x is the distance between point m and the travel lane m with the cart moving velocity set to be v the rotation cycle to be t and the moving distance of cart in one rotation cycle to be δl lup was divided into n units taking δl as the unit length and each unit was numbered where 12 m l u p δ l 1 for the jth calculation unit the vertical distance from the horizontal coordinate axis to the unit was 13 l v j δ l and the distance from the jth unit to the sprinkler was expressed by 14 l j l v 2 x 2 j δ l 2 x 2 the radial point based application rate was described by a polynomial fit curve 15 p d a i d i where d is the distance from point of measure to the sprinkler m p d is the application rate at the measured point mm h 1 ai is the fitting coefficient and i 0 1 2 6 with j 0 n substituted into the application rate curve it was possible to obtain the application rate at each unit as well as the corresponding time point then it was also possible to obtain a series of p t relationship points accordingly the relationship between the duration of precipitation and application rate could be obtained by creating a polynomial fit to these points as shown in eq 16 16 p t b i t i where t is the point in time of m in the spraying area h p t is the application rate at moment t mm h 1 bi is the fitting coefficient i 0 1 2 6 the cumulative water depth of the upper semicircle could be achieved by integrating the interval of 0 tup with p t 17 d u p x 0 t u p x p t d t where tup x is the length of time for the gun cart to pass through the region above the x axis 18 t u p x r 2 x 2 v the relationship between the precipitation duration and the application rate of point m when passing through the fan shaped spraying area could also be expressed by eq 15 the cumulative water depth ddown x was calculated by eq 19 19 d d o w n x 0 t d o w n x p t d t where tdown x is the length of time for the gun cart to pass through the area below the x axis the equation for tdown x is 20 t d o w n x x tan α 180 2 0 x r cos α 180 2 r 2 x 2 v r cos α 180 2 x r where α is the rotation angle of the sprinkler in degrees the cumulative water depth of point m is then be calculated as 21 d x d u p x d d o w n x the total spray duration of point m is 22 t m t u p x t d o w n x this model was adopted in our study to calculate the traveling cumulative water depth the rotating angle of the sprinkler was set to 270 and the traveling velocity of the sprinkler cart was 20 m h 1 2 2 7 traveling cumulative kinetic energy the expressions to calculate of cumulative kinetic energy sp are similar to those of cumulative water depth except that the radial application rate curve eq 15 was replaced by the expression of radial specific power ge et al 2018a 23 s p d p d μ e q 2 d v 7200 where μeq is the equivalent velocity at the measuring point which was derived from the total kinetic energy and the weight of droplets m s 1 area based kinetic energy kea j m 2 and volume based kinetic energy kev j m 2 mm 1 were adopted as evaluation indicators of cumulative kinetic energy distribution calculation of kea reveals the total energy striking soil surfaces during irrigation eq 24 and kev expresses the kinetic energy per unit volume of applied water eq 25 the equations are as follows 24 k e a m 0 t m s p m t d t 25 k e v m k e a m h m where hm is the spray water depth at the mth location mm 2 2 8 uniformity of overlapping spray distribution in practical applications multiple traveling sprinklers are established to ensure overlap and achieve greater evenness of the spray water distribution under moving spray condition as used here one big gun moved lineally along a travel lane and then was shifted to an adjacent lane at a distance where the spray pattern overlapped that of the previous lane fig 6 the spray uniformity coefficient an important indicator to evaluate the irrigation performance was then determined it is necessary to compare the effect of the overlapping distance on the uniformity of spray the distribution uniformity coefficient dulq recommended by usda burt et al 1997 was adopted and calculated as follows eq 26 26 d u l q d l q d t o t a l where d l q is the depth of water accumulated in that quarter of the field area receiving the smallest depth of accumulation and d t o t a l is the average irrigation depth of the whole spray area two sprinkler guns of the same model were placed at various overlapping spray distances of 0 0 1r 0 2r r r is the corresponding radius of throw under different operating pressures to determine their traveling cumulative water depth from the calculated water depth the distribution uniformity coefficient dulq were determined according to eq 26 2 2 9 influence of spray kinetic energy on infiltration rate the impact on soil surface from irrigation sprinklers due to the kinetic energy of spray can alter surface soil structure and reduce the soil infiltration rate the impact is a primary cause of soil erosion and surface runoff therefore the effects of spray kinetic energy of 50pyc and hy50 on infiltration rate ir in mm h 1 were compared mohammed and kohl 1987 investigated the effect of droplet kinetic energy on infiltration rate with vienna loam soil 43 sand 34 silt and 23 clay the results showed that the key indicators affecting infiltration rate are kea and kev based on the experimental results of mohammed and kohl 1987 ge et al 2018a proposed a mathematical model to calculate infiltration rates based on kea and kev as shown in eq 27 in this study ge et al s 2018a model was adopted to simulate infiltration rates values obtained for the kinetic energy of 50pyc and hy50 gun sprinklers it should be noted that the data source of the model was derived from experiments conducted by mohammed and kohl 1987 therefore this model may be only applicable to the specific type of soil used in their study 27 ir 147 1 k e v 12 2 k e a 135 8 34 1 113 1 k e a 135 8 375 2 k e v 12 2 k e a 135 8 113 34 1 1 k e v 12 2 17 7 2 k e v 12 2 k e a 135 8

increase of working pressure and greater nozzle diameter fig 7 the flow rates of 50pyc and hy50 increased by 16 6 19 4 and 20 2 21 4 for the respective nozzle diameters of 18 mm and 20 mm used with either sprinkler across the various operating pressures with any combination of the two sprinkler types and two nozzle sizes the flow rate increases logarithmically with increasing operating pressure the flow rates of 50pyc and hy50 were similar at the same operation pressure by substituting flow rate in eq 4 for the two sprinklers the sprayed area per unit time of 50pyc and hy50 under different pressures and nozzle diameters were calculated the following values for effective utilization factor of working hours irrigation efficiency and irrigation depth of 0 9 75 and 20 mm respectively were used in the calculations the sprayed area per unit time of 50pyc and hy50 varied from 467 1000 m2 h 1 18 mm nozzle diameter and 533 1200 m2 h 1 20 mm nozzle diameter under the operating pressure of 0 1 0 5 mpa 3 2 radius of throw the radius of throw of 50pyc and hy50 under different operating pressures are shown in fig 8 the geometric logarithms of radius of throw increased with increasing operating pressures the radius of throw of hy50 was generally higher than that of 50pyc with a difference of approximately 8 1 to 21 9 this phenomenon can be explained by two aspects 1 the difference in the mechanical structures of the vertical impact and turbine drive gun sprinklers and 2 the variation of rotation speed the structure of the 50pyc sprinkler caused the main water jet to strike the deflector directly resulting in large disturbances of the jet stream of water and thus relatively high energy loss in contrast the main water jet of the hy50 received relatively less interference despite the presence of a water breaker the driving force that drives the sprinkler to rotate comes from water shooting from a secondary nozzle the variation in rotation speed also contributes to the difference in radius of throw the radius of throw decreased greatly with the increase of rotation speed li et al 2014 the test results of this study show that the rotating speed of 50pyc reached up to 0 86 1 5 r min while the rotating speed of hy50 varied from 0 12 to 0 6 r min table 1 the rotating speed of 50pyc was always higher than that of hy50 3 3 water application rate significant differences were observed in radial application rates between the two spray guns at different working pressures fig 9 the radial water distribution of 50pyc primarily appeared in a unimodal distribution with the peak point close to the sprinkler the peak values of application rate at working pressures of 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa were 17 1 16 4 15 6 and 16 7 mm h 1 respectively the working pressure had little effect on the peak value of application rate by contrast the radial application rate of hy50 changed gradually from a unimodal distribution to a biomodal distribution with the increase of working pressure the peak value of application rate was located near the perimeter of the radius of throw the application rate peaked at 25 8 16 5 12 0 and 11 2 mm h 1 under respective working pressures of 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa moreover the peak value of application rate decreased rapidly with the increase of working pressure the difference in radial application rate can also be attributed to the different rotational mechanisms between sprinkler types the main jet of 50pyc was perturbed by the spray arm resulting in a concentrated distribution of water nearest the sprinkler in contrast the spray jet of hy50 was not perturbed thus the spray water concentrated near the perimeter of the spray range under low working pressure however as the working pressure increased the degree of destabilization of the spray jet increased numerous small sized droplets appeared near the sprinkler which lead to an increase in the amount of irrigation water at that location as a result the distribution of the radial application rate transformed from a unimodal into a saddle shaped distribution fig 9 the average application rates of 50pyc and hy50 were calculated by eq 7 and can be viewed in fig 10 average application rates of both 50pyc and hy50 gun sprinkler clearly decreased as the operating pressure increased this is likely due to the greater increase in spray control area in the denominator of eq 7 causing the average application rate to decrease accordingly despite the rising flow rates with the increase of operating pressure consistent flow rates and the difference between throw radii may have contributed to the significantly lower average application rate of hy50 than that of 50pyc with a nozzle diameter of 18 mm the average application rate of hy50 was 14 6 35 9 lower than that of 50pyc with nozzle diameter of 20 mm the average application rate of hy50 was 11 27 2 lower than that of 50pyc excessive water application rate may lead to surface ponding and runoff and can exacerbate soil erosion and induce formation of surface crust in contrast low water application rate can result in an insufficient supply of water per unit of time and thus require longer working hours of the irrigation machine to compensate for the insufficient supply the point based application rate pi and the average application rate pavg play different roles in practical use pi is important for calculating spraying uniformity and pavg is used to design sprinkler irrigation systems sometimes pi is used as an indicator of local surface ponding 3 4 droplet size the volume weighted average drop sizes of 50pyc and hy50 under different operating pressures are shown in fig 11 droplet diameter increased exponentially with distance from the sprinkler which this founding was consistent with the results of chen and wallender 1985 however the sprinklers of interest in their study were mid sized impact sprinklers and fixed plate spray nozzles meanwhile the volume weighted average drop size at the same distance from the sprinkler decreased with increasing operating pressures which verified the conclusion of montero et al 2003 that working pressure is the main factor affecting droplet size distribution of the sprinkler the volume weighted average diameters of 50pyc near the perimeter of the radius of throw under operating pressures of 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa were 3 1 2 7 2 8 and 3 0 mm respectively while the diameters of hy50 were 3 5 3 3 3 1 and 3 6 mm respectively the droplet sizes of the hy50 sprinkler were clearly bigger which was likely due to the fact that the main jet from the principal nozzle from the hy50 sprinkler was not disturbed while the jet of the main nozzle from 50pyc sprinkler strikes directly with the impact arm the impact of 50pyc sprinkler breaks down the jet in drops also the energy losses due to the impact of the drive arm on the jet likely reduced its kinetic energy and thus decreased its radius of throw furthermore the difference of droplet size likely contributed to the difference of hydraulic performance between the two gun sprinklers droplets of smaller size are susceptible to wind drift and evaporation causing greater water loss dechmi et al 2003 molle et al 2012 however large droplets carry higher kinetic energy which intensifies their impact and compaction on the soil exacerbating adverse effects such as soil erosion and surface runoff king and bjorneberg 2010 the effect of nozzle diameter on the distribution of droplet size is shown in fig 12 considering the influence of test accuracy 0 195 mm on the results of small droplet sizes close to the sprinkler the sizes of water droplets over 6 m away from the sprinkler were compared for the 50pyc spray gun fig 12a the volume weighted average drop size showed slight increases in size with the increase in nozzle diameter from 18 mm to 20 mm the increasing rates were lower than 10 the variation of droplet size in response to the change of nozzle diameter for hy50 remained nearly the same as that of 50pyc the volume weighted average diameter increased by 15 when the diameter of nozzle changed from 18 mm to 20 mm in general with the increase of nozzle diameter both the radius of throw and the volume weighted average diameter of the vertical impact spray gun and turbine spray gun increased accordingly 3 5 radial kinetic energy the radial specific power of 50pyc and hy50 were calculated based on the droplet diameter and velocity of droplets at each sampling point fig 13 there was a significant difference in distributions of radial specific power between the two spray guns the specific power distribution of 50pyc transformed from a triangle to saddle like shape when the operating pressure increased from 0 15 mpa to 0 45 mpa the peak value of specific power was measured at the outer end of the radius of throw the peak values reached 0 074 0 046 0 057 and 0 040 j m 2 s 1 under the pressures 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa respectively indicating no significant change with the increase of working pressure in contrast the radial specific power of hy50 consistently presented a triangular distribution with the changes in operating pressure the peak value of specific power was also measured at the outer end of the spray zone however the peak values were significantly higher than those of 50pyc reaching 0 2 0 1 0 084 and 0 069 j m 2 s 1 under 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa respectively the peak value of specific power decreased with the increase of operating pressure notably the radial distribution pattern of specific power of 50pyc differed greatly from the radial distribution pattern of application rate as illustrated in fig 6 the radial application rate of 50pyc decreased with increasing distance from the sprinkler and the peak value of application rate occurred at a distance close to the sprinkler moreover the peak value of specific power occurred at the outer end of the spray wet zone fig 13 the peak values of application rate and specific power in relation to distances from the sprinkler under different operating pressures for both the 50pyc and hy50 spray guns are summarized in table 2 the recorded distance of the peak value of the specific power of 50pyc was located within 70 80 of the radius of throw while the distance of the peak value of the radial application rate was located within 10 30 of the radius of throw by contrast the peak points of application rate and specific power for hy50 were almost overlapping occurring at approximately 65 85 of the distance of its radius of throw these results show that high radial application rate does not indicate high spray kinetic energy for instance the highest radial application rate of 50pyc appeared near the sprinkler however the water at this location was mostly impact dissipated by the baffles and the stream was fully broken the sizes of the droplets were relatively small and the speeds of the droplets were low therefore this section of spray water carried a limited amount of kinetic energy the spray kinetic energy was not determined simply by the droplet size and velocity fig 11 shows that the size of water droplets were largest at the farthest end of the spray range and the water droplet velocity was positively correlated with particle size of droplets ge et al 2018b however the highest value of the specific power was not at the outermost end of the spray control area fig 13 although the droplet size and velocity reach their maximums at the outer end the rapid decrease of sprinkler application rate leads to the decrease of specific power the specific power peaks only when the droplet size velocity and application rate are maintained at a high levels the experimental results also indicate that the peak value points of spray kinetic energy of both 50pyc and hy50 were consistently observed within 65 85 of the radius of throw 3 6 traveling cumulative water depth the cumulative spray water depth was calculated based on the radial application rate and the corresponding operating parameters the cumulative depth of irrigation water perpendicular to the travel lane of the two spray guns initially increased and subsequently decreased with increasing distance from the travel lane displaying a parabolic distribution the sprayed water depth of 50pyc near the travel lane was significantly higher than that of the hy50 spray gun the maximum irrigation depth under the operating pressures of 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa for the 50pyc spray gun were 19 9 20 8 23 3 and 23 9 mm respectively while the maximum irrigation depths for the hy50 spray gun were 20 7 16 8 21 9 and 20 8 mm respectively overall hy50 depths were lower than that of 50pyc the average application rate at each point perpendicular to the travel lane during the irrigation process was obtained by dividing the cumulative depth by the spray duration as shown in fig 14 there was a significant difference in the average application rate between 50pyc and hy50 under mobile spray conditions for the 50pyc vertical impact gun sprinkler the average application rate decreased with the increase in distance from the travel lane and the peak values of application rate were 13 4 11 6 9 5 and 10 6 mm h 1 under the respective operating pressures of 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa in contrast for the hy50 turbine drive gun sprinkler the average application rate transformed from a donut shape to a flat trapezoid distribution with the increase in operating pressures of 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa the peak values of application rate at each pressure value were 13 8 7 1 7 4 and 6 1 mm h 1 respectively the application rate under the mobile spraying system was relatively lower for hy50 which can be attributed to the larger radius of throw as well as the longer spray duration at each data sampling point 3 7 traveling cumulative kinetic energy the measured radial spray kinetic energy of 50pyc and hy50 were substituted into the calculation model proposed by ge et al 2018a to obtain the traveling cumulative kinetic energy kea the results are shown in fig 15 for 18 mm nozzle diameter spray guns similar to the distribution of cumulative water depth the cumulative kinetic energy perpendicular to the travel lane increased and then decreased with increasing distance from the travel lane showing a parabolic distribution generally the cumulative kinetic energy of hy50 was higher than that of 50pyc the peak values of kinetic energy of 50pyc were 446 404 553 and 389 j m 2 under the respective operating pressures of 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa for the hy50 gun sprinkler the peak values of kinetic energy were 781 475 630 and 572 j m 2 respectively for the same amount of spray water the kinetic energy of hy50 was 1 5 2 4 times that of 50pyc the volume based kinetic energy kev at each point perpendicular to the travel lane during the irrigation process was obtained by dividing the cumulative kinetic energy by the cumulative water depth fig 15 the volume based kinetic energy of both spray guns increased with increasing distance from the travel lane in most spray areas the volume based kinetic energy of spray water of hy50 was higher than that of 50pyc the peak values of volume based kinetic energy of 50pyc were 32 2 37 1 37 7 and 30 9 j m 2 mm 1 under the operating pressures of 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa respectively while of the hy50 spray gun these peak values were 44 3 51 7 47 8 and 54 3 j m 2 mm 1 respectively there are various indicators to describe the sprinkler kinetic energy according to previous studies the two indicators kea and kev can effectively predict and evaluate the infiltration rate and soil erosion caused by the kinetic energy of sprinkler precipitation for instance mohammed and kohl 1987 analyzed the effects of changes in kea and kev on infiltration rate kea was thought to be the direct cause of breakdown of surface exposed aggregates while the value of kev determines the thickness of surface seal layer the model constructed by ge et al 2018a to calculate infiltration rate well supported this view according to the model when kev is greater than 12 2 j m 2 mm 1 and kea is greater than 135 8 j m 2 the infiltration rate decreases with increases of kev and kea according to agassi et al s 1994 study the major decrease in final infiltration rate was already achieved at a kev lower than10 j m 2 mm 1 in addition wash erosion and splash erosion is largely attributable to the value of kev wash erosion increased exponentially with the increase in kev and splash erosion increased linearly with the increase in kev agassi et al 1994 where kev was greater than 16 j m 2 mm 1 wash erosion increased sharply with an increase in kev according to the fig 15 the overall kev and kea of hy50 were higher than those of 50pyc indicating a greater risk of the breakdown of surface exposed aggregates thicker soil crusts and more soil erosion 3 8 uniformity of overlapping spray distribution fig 16 presents the distribution of uniformity coefficients of 18 mm nozzle diameter 50pyc and hy50 under different operating pressures and overlapping distances the distribution of uniformity coefficients of both gun sprinklers increased and then decreased with increasing overlapping distance of the coverage area of spray water and under different operating pressures the traveling cumulative water depth perpendicular to the travel lane of the two spray guns showed a parabolic distribution fig 14 and the irrigation depth was lower at the outer end of the spray range however with overlapping spray by multiple sprinklers the water deficient edges received supplemental watering by the neighboring sprinkler and thus irrigation depth at points furthest from each sprinkler became more uniform as the overlapping distance increased water depth rose sharply in the overlapping areas and presented a unimodal distribution the water distribution became uneven and the distribution uniformity coefficient decreased accordingly for the 50pyc spray gun the highest values of distribution uniformity coefficients under the respective operating pressures 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa were 80 5 85 6 82 2 and 87 8 respectively and the corresponding overlapping distances were 0 3r 0 5r 0 5r and 0 5r for the hy50 spray gun the highest values of distribution uniformity coefficients under the four operating pressures were respectively 67 1 75 8 76 9 and 75 7 at the overlapping distances 0 1r 0 2r 0 3r and 0 5r fig 16 shows that the pair of 50pyc gun sprinklers obtained higher spray distribution coefficients than that of the hy50 pair however un sprayed areas is an important problem when the overlap distance is small for instance the distribution uniformity coefficients of 50pyc at 0 25 and 0 35 mpa were only 29 7 and 26 4 with an overlap distance of 0 by contrast the distribution uniformity coefficients of hy50 were 50 3 and 43 6 under the same conditions based on results of the sprinkler operating pressure radius of throw and spray uniformity coefficient the optimal distance of overlapping spray area for 50pyc under different pressures 0 15 0 45 mpa was 34 50 m while for hy50 the optimal distance of overlapping spray area at 0 15 to 0 45 mpa was 41 63 m in comparing the two gun sprinklers the suitable overlapping distances for the two sprinklers are the same to a large extent however because the radius of throw for hy50 was 8 1 21 9 greater than that of 50pyc the overlapping spray distance of hy50 was higher than that of 50pyc thus for instance under the operating pressure of 0 25 mpa the overlapping distance between sprinklers of hy50 was 54 8 m while that of 50pyc was 37 5 m this suggests that implementation of the hy50 gun sprinkler would require fewer auxiliary facilities in the field such as hydrants and travel lanes which can reduce the total costs of establishing an irrigation system in addition the total time required to implement a hose drawn traveler irrigator equipped with the hy50 gun sprinkler would be lower than the time needed to implement the same irrigation system with the 50pyc and ultimately increase irrigation area per unit time 3 9 influence of spray kinetic energy on infiltration rate the area based kinetic energy and volume based kinetic energy of 50pyc and hy50 were substituted into the above model and the infiltration rate after one session of spraying under different operating pressures were calculated and presented in fig 17 it should be noted that in mohammed and kohl s 1987 the maximum value of kev was 24 4 j m 2 mm 1 while in our study kev of 50pyc and hy50 ranged from 11 3 63 9 j m 2 mm 1 it was assumed the calculation model was still valid to facilitate the comparative analysis of two spray guns the infiltration rate of each sampling point perpendicular to the travel lane initially decreased and then increased with increasing distance from the lane under the mobile spray conditions the decrease in infiltration rate of the hy50 spray gun was greater than that of the 50pyc spray gun the greatest drops in infiltration rates from 50pyc under the four operating pressures were to 41 4 86 7 mm h 1 32 1 99 9 mm h 1 51 7 71 mm h 1 and 27 2 107 1 mm h 1 of the initial infiltration rate the lowest values of infiltration rate of hy50 were 37 3 77 2 55 2 and 63 8 mm h 1 under the respective four pressures and amounted to 74 6 47 5 62 5 and 56 6 of the initial infiltration rate respectively these results indicate that surface ponding is more likely to occur with the hy50 sprayer than the 50pyc sprayer if the same amount of water is applied when designing an irrigation system often application rate is the factor that designers consider above all others in selecting a sprinkler unit because of the magnitude of impact that application rate may have on crops and soil surfaces however our results suggest that the lower application rate of hy50 is not a good indicator of milder impacts and that the amount of kinetic energy carried by spray water also plays an important role in the interaction between the spray water and their infiltration rates in soils the benefits associated with lower application rate may be negated by the higher kinetic energy and lower infiltration rate which often increases the formation of surface seal and runoff 4 conclusions two typical large volume gun sprinklers 50pyc vertical impact and hy50 turbine drive have wide applications in industrial dust removal and agricultural irrigation the market price of the two sprinklers are equivalent approximately 2000 yuan each 300 us dollars due to the limited knowledge of hydraulic performance of vertical impact and turbine drive big gun sprinklers it is difficult to select between the two gun sprinklers simply based on the basic hydraulic parameters e g flow rate provided by the manufacturer in this study the spray characteristics of 50pyc and hy50 under stationary and mobile spray conditions were empirically compared and analyzed with model calculations due to the different rotation mechanism of the two gun sprinklers the main spray jet of 50pyc was heavily disturbed while the main spray jet of hy50 was not this resulted in significant differences in the radius of throw droplet size water distribution and kinetic energy distribution between the two gun sprinklers under the working pressure of 0 15 0 45 mpa the radius of throw of hy50 was 8 1 21 9 bigger than that of 50pyc and the volume weighted droplet size of hy50 was 7 8 21 7 greater than that of 50pyc the average application rate of hy50 was 11 0 35 9 lower than that of 50pyc however the peak value of specific power of hy50 was 1 5 2 7 times that of 50pyc and the cumulative kinetic energy of hy50 was 1 5 2 4 times that of 50pyc the differences in the hydraulic performance of the 50pyc and hy50 gun sprinklers implies different effects in the field the spray water of 50pyc was more evenly distributed with the highest values of distribution uniformity coefficients that were 5 3 13 5 higher than values of hy50 more evenly disributed water is more conducive to increasing crop yield and water use efficiency meanwhile the larger radius of throw of hy50 would require fewer auxiliary facilities such as hydrants and travel lanes as well as less ineffective time which brings more savings in terms of capital investment and labor cost in addition the overall kev and kea of hy50 were higher than those of 50pyc indicating a higher risk of breakdown of surface exposed aggregates and thicker soil crusts thus the benefits associated with lower application rate would ne negated by the higher kinetic energy and lower infiltration rate which often increases the formation of surface seal and runoff in conclusion this empirical study highlights the differences in spray hydraulic performance between a typical vertical impact drive gun sprinkler and a typical turbine drive gun sprinkler soil and crop types irrigation water quality and economic and labor costs should also be taken into consideration when selecting between the two gun sprinklers in order to

10788,the deep root system of safflower carthamus tinctorius l is an important adaptive trait under rainfed conditions in semi arid agriculture lower water requirements and ability to tolerate abiotic stresses make safflower a potential alternative crop for the southern high plains shp however information on water extraction patterns of safflower and its role in oil yield formation under center pivot irrigation system that keeps only the surface soil profile wet with frequent irrigations is limited therefore a field experiment was conducted in a split plot design at clovis new mexico during 2012 and 2013 growing seasons to assess the soil water use patterns evapotranspiration and oil yield of two spring safflower cultivars under different preseason and in season irrigation levels half of the experimental units received 164 and 153 mm of preseason irrigation in 2012 and 2013 respectively while the other half remained unirrigated five in season irrigation levels i1 i5 ranging from 88 to 392 mm in 2012 and from 83 to 373 mm in 2013 were applied to preseason and no preseason irrigation blocks on average safflower extracted 70 and 28 mm of stored soil moisture in the preseason and no preseason irrigation treatments which significantly increased evapotranspiration et water use efficiency wue and oil yield in preseason compared to no preseason irrigation treatment average water extraction decreased with increasing level of in season irrigation and a decline of 32 27 and 25 in soil moisture at the end of the season compared to initial soil moisture were observed in i1 i3 and i5 respectively since wue was not much affected by in season irrigation treatment in both years limiting the in season irrigation level to i4 can save 17 of irrigation with a corresponding 9 reduction in oil yield the relatively smaller differences were observed for water extraction and wue among the cultivars overall safflower was able to use preseason irrigation water more efficiently in semi arid shp growers can pre irrigate safflower and reduce its in season irrigation to allocate more water to high water requirement traditional crops such as corn keywords evapotranspiration water use efficiency oilseed crop drought tolerant crop 1 introduction drought erratic rainfall and a decline in irrigation water availability are the main factors that limit crop productivity in arid and semi arid environments ali et al 2019 low annual precipitation 350 500 mm and high potential evapotranspiration 1500 1750 mm of semi arid southern high plains shp of the us are jeopardizing the sustainability of agriculture in the region twdb 2012 the primary source of irrigation in the shp is the ogallala aquifer which stretches from the south dakota in the north to texas in the south and is declining rapidly especially in the shp xue et al 2014 it is estimated that 2 million hectare meter of water is pumped annually from the aquifer if the current withdrawal rate continues it is projected that about 35 of currently irrigated land in the shp might shift to dryland in approximately next 15 years haacker et al 2016 this decline in pumping capacity can no longer meet the peak irrigation requirements of most of the major crops grown in the shp during the summer it is encouraging growers to use water saving strategies such as deficit irrigation site specific irrigation management scheduling irrigation based on weather and crop stage and planting crops that efficiently utilize stored soil water in root zone neupane and guo 2019 during the drought periods ability of a crop to extract soil moisture depends on the uniformity and depth of its root system the moisture left by the previous crop or moisture stored by preseason precipitation irrigation in the soil profile and amount of in season precipitation irrigation received eslam et al 2010 studies conducted on preseason irrigation also known as pre plant off season or dormant irrigation technique during the mid eighties in the diverse environmental condition showed that the preseason irrigation is not beneficial compared to in season irrigation in the humid and semi humid regions because winter precipitation could replenish a significant portion of the soil profile moisture schlegel et al 2012 however in the arid semi arid region preseason irrigation technique could be a unique strategy to render the crop from water stress especially when irrigation systems are not capable to meet the peak water requirements during in season schlegel et al 2012 stone et al 1987 even the water extracted from the deeper profile is small moisture stored from preseason can significantly buffer stress at critical growth stages of a crop and this helps in reducing the competition for in season irrigation and contributes to the yield stone et al 1987 though soil characteristic plays important role in water storage use of bubbler pad in the center pivot irrigation system one of the most widely adopted irrigation technique in the shp can considerably help store water received from preseason irrigation in deeper soil profiles hence in environments where the availability of water is variable and difficult to predict assessing the crop s ability to utilize preseason and in season irrigation and evaluating the water use pattern could better help manage the crop production crops like safflower carthamus tinctorius l with xerophytic spines on leaves and flower bracts and with deep taproot system can efficiently utilize the available soil moisture to fulfill their water requirement singh et al 2016a safflower being evolved in the arid regions of fertile crescent of the middle east has the ability to tolerate drought and heat chapman and burke 2007 depending on the soil depth safflower taproots can grow up to 2 2 m deep with numerous thin horizontal lateral roots conferring the ability to draw moisture and nutrients from a substantial depth dajue and mündel 1996 this strong rooting system enables safflower to survive in low water availability regions like the shp safflower is primarily grown for edible oil birdseed and food color omidi et al 2012 furthermore including safflower in the cropping system of the shp could 1 aid to the local vegetable oil production 2 provide an option for crop rotation to break the insects and disease cycle and 3 provide the valuable feed to livestock however very few studies are available on safflower adaptability drought response soil water use patterns and oil yield under different irrigation management practices in the semi arid shp therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of preseason and in season irrigation amounts on water use patterns and yield of spring safflower cultivars in the shp 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment description a 2 year field experiment was conducted at the new mexico state university agricultural science center clovis nm 34 35 n 103 12 w and altitude of 1348 m above mean sea level during 2012 and 2013 growing seasons the climate at clovis is semi arid with an annual average precipitation of 445 mm and the annual mean maximum and minimum temperatures of 22 c and 7 c respectively singh et al 2014 the soil at the experiment site was olton clay loam fine mixed superlative thermic aridic paleustoll soil ph was 7 7 and 7 9 and organic matter content was 1 5 and 1 6 in 2012 and 2013 respectively the experimental field was disked and plowed before planting to incorporate residue and to form a seedbed each year the field was divided into four blocks two blocks were randomly assigned to preseason irrigation and the other two were assigned to no preseason irrigation the preseason irrigation blocks received total preseason irrigation of 164 mm in 2012 and 153 mm in 2013 to recharge the soil profile exhausted by previous crops corn zea mays l and winter wheat triticum aestivum l respectively fig 1 the total preseason irrigation was applied in four splits to the preseason irrigation blocks between february and march to avoid any runoff a center pivot system with bubbler pads was used for irrigating the blocks bubbler pads helped to ensure a deeper percolation of the irrigation water while reducing wind and evaporation losses the no preseason irrigation blocks did not receive any preseason irrigation and were separated from the preseason irrigation blocks with buffer strips 1 83 3 66 m wide to keep out any irrigation water from the preseason irrigation blocks the final 25 mm of preseason irrigation before planting was applied with spray pads to all four blocks to create uniform seedbed moisture for the entire trial the experiment field was fertilized with 100 kg n ha 1 and 40 kg p2o5 ha 1 based on soil test recommendations at planting in both years a pre plant herbicide treflan hfp 2 5 l ha 1 was incorporated into the soil for weed control each year safflower was planted on 9 april 2012 and 4 april 2013 respectively using a plot drill model 3p600 great plains drill salina ks usa the target population of 625 000 plants ha 1 with 85 emergence rate was used for seed calculation the plot size was 9 4 m2 with two passes 11 rows per pass in each plot to ensure good plant stand a total of 88 and 83 mm of irrigation was applied to the entire trial over a two week period in 2012 and 2013 respectively fig 1 extremely dry warm and windy spring weather in both seasons necessitated higher amounts of establishment irrigation than planned after the safflower seedlings started emerging an above ground drip irrigation system with water meters was installed on each plot to regulate irrigation application to each experimental unit separately once the crop was well established surface drip system took over the irrigation the goal was to develop crop response to irrigation ranging from near rainfed to 300 mm of in season irrigation which is the maximum irrigation farmer in the region can afford on a crop like safflower irrigations were scheduled to meet the target amount of water assigned to a particular treatment covering all critical growth stages the scheduled irrigation was skipped when significant rainfall occurred around the time of a planned irrigation event the crop was harvested on 7 august 2012 and 13 august 2013 2 2 weather condition during the growing seasons the average values of weather variables were different during the 2012 and 2013 safflower growing season at clovis nm fig 2 the seasonal average air temperature was higher in the month of april may and july in 2012 compared to 2013 making a more favorable growing condition for safflower in the early stage however it was similar in the month of june and august in both years the cumulative daily rainfall during 2013 growing season was 150 mm which was 30 more compared to 2012 growing season even though the amount of rainfall received during 2012 was less it was well distributed throughout the growing season whereas rainfall was concentrated at the later stage of crop growth in 2013 fig 2 july and august received 83 of the growing season rainfall in 2013 which led to higher relative humidity rh in those months compared to 2012 in general july and august were the most humid months in both years vapor pressure deficit vpd values were observed higher in 2012 than in 2013 and peak vpd values were found in the month of june in both years 2 3 experimental design and statistical analysis the research project was laid out in a split plot design with three factors including preseason irrigation levels in season irrigation levels and cultivars preseason irrigation was the main factor with two levels consisting of preseason irrigation and no preseason irrigation combinations of five irrigation levels i1 i2 i3 i4 and i5 and two cultivars of different stature s333 and pi8311 were randomized into sub plots all treatment combinations were replicated four times the analysis of variance was performed using the general linear model glm procedure of sas software version 9 2 sas institute inc nc usa by using appropriate error term to evaluate each factor and their interactions the means were separated by fisher s protected least significant difference lsd test at the 0 05 probability level 2 4 data collection the volumetric soil water content cm3 cm 3 was recorded in the lowest i1 middle i3 and highest i5 in season irrigation levels from preseason as well as no preseason irrigation blocks using a field calibrated soil moisture neutron gauge model 503 dr campbell pacific nuclear inc ca usa neutron access tubes were installed in the crop rows near the center of each plot to measure soil moisture to a depth of 1 6 m neutron probe readings were made from 0 1 to 1 5 m depth at 0 2 m depth increments to assess the moisture to the depth of 1 6 m hao et al 2015 soil water content mm at each depth was calculated by multiplying depth increment mm with volumetric water content for that depth increment soil water depletion at each depth between two sampling dates was determined by subtracting the soil water content of later measurement from the earlier measurement the total water content was calculated using measurements from 0 1 to 1 6 m depth seasonal crop evapotranspiration et was calculated by summing rainfall irrigation and change in soil water content between planting and post harvest singh et al 2016b a linear relationship between irrigation and crop et was used to determine seasonal crop et for i2 and i4 irrigation levels an area of 9 2 m2 was harvested using a plot combine model elite plot 2001 wintersteiger ried austria for seed yield and weights were adjusted to 10 seed moisture singh et al 2016a water use efficiency wue was calculated as the ratio of seed yield to seasonal et hao et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of preseason irrigation 3 1 1 initial soil water content and its extraction preseason and no preseason irrigation treatments had different soil water profiles at the time of planting in both years fig 3 and preseason irrigation significantly increased soil water content over no preseason irrigation at each observation depth the total soil profile water of preseason irrigation treatment was 9 higher compared to no preseason irrigation treatment in 2012 fig 3a while this was 12 higher in 2013 fig 3b the preseason irrigation units received an approximately similar amount of preseason irrigation in both years however at planting the initial soil water content at each depth in both preseason irrigation and no preseason irrigation treatments was higher in 2012 compared to 2013 which could be due to drier winter and spring before 2013 growing season the soil profile in 2013 was extremely dry in the deeper depth especially from 1 0 to 1 6 m depth safflower extracted a significant amount of soil water at each depth down to 1 6 m profile in preseason and no preseason irrigation treatments during both growing seasons fig 4 these results suggest that water extraction depth of safflower was not influenced by preseason irrigation application singh et al 2016b also reported no difference in water extraction depth of safflower grown under water stressed and non water stressed irrigation treatments in another study hao et al 2015 observed similar water extraction depth of maize zea mays l plants in response to different water regimes the maximum depth for soil water observations in the current study is 1 6 m which might not be enough to gauge the difference of safflower water extraction depth in response to water stress as the taproot of safflower can penetrate up to depth of 2 2 m bergman and kandel 2013 dajue and mündel 1996 this makes it more interesting to examine the water extraction of safflower deeper than 1 6 m and sets a new goal for future researchers in 2012 water extraction in preseason irrigation treatment was significant up to 1 2 m depth when compared soil water content of 17 days after planting dap with 50 dap fig 4a whereas in similar comparison for no preseason irrigation treatment significant water extraction was observed up to 0 8 m depth fig 4b this shows the efficient nature of safflower roots to utilize extra water available in preseason irrigation treatment even at its early growth stages the soil water extraction at 84 dap was greater than 17 and 50 dap throughout the observed soil profile in both irrigation treatments fig 4a and b and after that the soil water depletion was minimal the period from 50 to 84 dap covered important growth stages including vegetative growth flowering and seed set which caused maximum soil profile water extraction consistent with higher evapotranspiration et requirement of safflower safflower water requirement decreased after 84 dap due to it s gradual progress to physiological maturity which was the reason for minimal water extraction during this time there was also late rains during that stage in 2012 however little bit of extraction at the lowest depth was observed indicating safflower relied on deeper soil moisture for seed filling in 2013 similar to 2012 soil water extraction was observed up to 1 2 m depth in preseason irrigation treatment when soil water content of 25 dap was compared with 62 dap fig 4c however in no preseason irrigation treatment the water extraction was significant only up to 0 6 m fig 4d the soil water extraction was greater during 62 81 dap which covered the peak vegetative growth stage of safflower and decreased after 81 dap fig 4c and d overall period from 17 to 120 dap in 2012 soil profile water depleted by 30 and 18 in preseason and no preseason irrigation treatments compared to initial soil moisture respectively similarly in 2013 period from 25 to 132 dap soil profile water depletion values were 23 and 8 in preseason and no preseason irrigation treatments respectively these results suggest that safflower on average extracted up to 26 and 13 stored soil moisture in preseason and no preseason irrigation treatments the additional water use in preseason irrigation treatment was due to greater transpiration and photosynthesis that led to greater growth of safflower over no preseason irrigation singh et al 2016a 3 1 2 cumulative soil water extraction soil moisture extraction by safflower in preseason irrigation treatment was significantly higher than no preseason irrigation treatment as the season progressed in both years fig 5 in 2012 soil water extracted by preseason and no preseason irrigation treatment until 50 dap was significant only up to the depth of 0 8 m fig 5a however it was significant throughout the 1 6 m depth profile during the period of 0 84 fig 5b and 0 120 dap fig 5c similarly hao et al 2015 also showed the water extraction from shallow depth 0 2 0 4 m in the early growth stage of corn followed by greater depth 0 8 1 0 m with progressing growth stage this increase in soil water extraction depth with progressing growing season could be due to the increase in root growth merrill et al 2002 showed that the shallow root growth in the early growing season of safflower reaching a maximum root length of 1 8 m at 90 dap in haplustolls soil total water extracted values during the period of 0 50 0 84 and 0 120 dap for preseason irrigation treatment was 21 76 and 87 mm and for no preseason irrigation treatment were 11 47 and 53 mm in 2012 respectively fig 5a b and c preseason irrigation treatment extracted 91 62 and 64 more soil moisture compared to no preseason irrigation treatment during the period of 0 50 0 84 and 0 120 dap in 2012 respectively yonts et al 2018 also observed significant water extraction in beans when the growing season received a greater amount of preseason rainfall compared to the growing season with little preseason rainfall total water extraction during the periods of 0 62 and 0 132 dap for preseason irrigation treatment was significant up to 1 2 and 1 6 m depths however for no preseason irrigation treatment it was only significant up to 0 6 and 1 4 m depth in 2013 respectively fig 5d and f the amounts of total soil water extracted during the period of 0 62 0 81 and 0 132 dap by preseason irrigation treatment were 33 57 and 53 mm and by no preseason irrigation treatment were 13 20 and 4 mm in 2013 respectively in 2012 and 2013 at the end of the growing season there was net 88 and 53 mm of soil water depletion in preseason irrigation treatment whereas only 52 and 4 mm in no preseason irrigation treatment respectively overall water extraction from soil profile was greater for preseason irrigation treatment as compared to no preseason irrigation for both years this could be due to the increased physiological activity and plant growth in preseason treatment similarly amini et al 2013 also showed the increased chlorophyll content and photosynthetic activity in safflower receiving higher irrigation amount compared to water deficit treatment 3 2 effects of in season irrigation 3 2 1 initial soil moisture and its extraction soil water content in all in season irrigation treatments decreased significantly down to 1 6 m depth irrespective of irrigation amount suggesting no variation in the water extraction depths among different in season irrigation treatments fig 6 initially moisture levels in all in season irrigation treatments were relatively similar however at the end of growing season significant decline in soil moisture was observed in i1 in season irrigation treatment compared i3 and i5 treatments in both years this indicates the ability of safflower to extract soil moisture from considerable depth when available moisture is low in 2012 there was a significant water extraction up to 1 m depth in i1 in season irrigation treatment during 17 dap when compared to 50 dap fig 6a and likewise for i3 and i5 water extraction was significant up to a depth of 0 8 and 0 6 m fig 6b and c respectively similarly in 2013 water extraction was significant up to the depth of 1 2 m in i1 in season irrigation treatment during 25 dap when compared to 62 dap fig 6d and for i3 and i5 it was only significant up to the depth of 1 m fig 6e and f hao et al 2015 also observed the greater water extraction by corn when the irrigation amount was decreased greater water depletion was observed during the period of 50 84 dap in 2012 compared to 62 81 dap in 2013 in 2012 the total water depletion values from the soil profile during the period of 50 84 dap were 44 40 and 56 mm in i1 i3 and i5 in season irrigation treatments which were 292 180 and 166 greater compared to the period of 62 81 dap in 2013 respectively fig 6 this could be due to higher vpd and more favorable temperature during the early to mid growing season in 2012 compared to 2013 fig 2 which resulted in increased physiological activity and et leading to greater water extraction 3 2 2 growth stage based soil water extraction safflower extracted more water from the upper soil layers during the early growing season vegetative growth stage and from deeper layers later in the season reproductive growth stage from all in season irrigation treatments fig 7 however plants in water deficit treatment i1 extracted soil moisture from deeper depths when compared to i3 and i5 in both years during the vegetative stage 17 50 dap in 2012 and 25 62 dap in 2013 i1 treatment extracted water up to the depth of 1 2 and 1 4 m in 2012 and 2013 fig 7a and d respectively whereas both i3 and i5 treatments extracted water up to the depth of 1 m in 2012 fig 7b and c and 1 2 m in 2013 fig 7e and f in both years safflower extracted significantly more amounts of water in i1 in season irrigation treatment followed by i3 and i5 treatments in both the growing periods the total amounts of water extracted by i1 i3 and i5 treatments during the vegetative period were 26 20 and 3 mm in 2012 and 27 23 and 19 mm in 2013 respectively during reproductive period 50 120 dap in 2012 and 62 132 dap in 2013 in 2012 40 27 and 24 mm of total soil water amounts were extracted whereas interestingly there was net recharge of 5 15 and 14 mm of soil moisture in 2013 in i1 i3 and i5 treatments respectively this recharge of soil water in 2013 is due to the greater amount of late season rainfall fig 2 which exceeded the crop water need 3 2 3 total water extraction a significant amount of soil moisture was extracted throughout the growing season at each soil depth in all in season irrigation treatments in both years fig 8 the amount of total water extracted by safflower in each in season irrigation treatment in 2012 was more than twice compared to 2013 in 2012 the total amounts of soil water depletion from beginning to the last observation 17 120 dap were 78 69 and 63 mm in i1 i3 and i5 treatments respectively fig 8a similarly the water depletion values from 25 to 132 dap in 2013 were 34 24 and 28 mm in i1 i3 and i5 treatments respectively fig 8b this indicates that on average safflower was able to extract 56 47 and 46 mm of stored soil water in i1 i3 and i5 treatments respectively this shows that the soil water extraction along the profile decreased with increasing water supply hao et al 2015 have also shown a similar result of decreasing soil water extraction from the soil profile with increasing irrigation amount in corn 3 2 4 effect of cultivars on soil water extraction both cultivars significantly extracted soil water up to the depth of 1 6 m in both years fig 9 the cultivars pi8311 extracted 158 131 and 115 mm of total soil moisture in i1 i3 and i5 irrigation treatments whereas cultivar s333 extracted 153 144 and 137 mm in 2012 respectively fig 9a c similarly in 2013 cultivar pi8311 extracted 60 35 and 64 mm of soil moisture and cultivar s333 extracted 75 35 and 47 mm of soil moisture in i1 i3 and i5 irrigation treatment fig 9d f on average cultivar s333 extracted 114 101 and 92 mm of soil moisture in i1 i2 and i3 irrigation treatments which was 5 22 and 3 greater than pi8311 respectively however no distinct pattern in water extraction was observed among the cultivars across different in season irrigation treatments in both years 3 3 evapotranspiration there were significant differences in the seasonal evapotranspiration et among the preseason irrigation treatments in season irrigation treatments and cultivars in both years table 1 the treatment that received the preseason irrigation had the highest level of et in both years the et in preseason irrigation treatment was 440 and 427 mm which was 8 6 and 12 7 greater than no preseason irrigation treatment in 2012 and 2013 respectively the irrigation applied two months prior to the planting significantly increased the available soil moisture and increased the seasonal et in preseason irrigation treatment compared to no preseason irrigation treatment a similar observation of increased et was also reported by stone et al 1987 in corn and winter wheat when the preseason irrigation was applied similarly the highest et was observed in i5 in season irrigation treatment and the lowest in i1 in season irrigation treatment in both years table 1 these results were pronounced since i5 irrigation treatment received the highest and the i1 received the lowest amount of irrigation water the et for i5 irrigation treatment was 575 and 550 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively this et was twice as much as i1 irrigation treatment in both years the et in intermediated in season irrigation treatment i3 was 411 and 394 mm which was 44 and 47 greater than i1 and 28 and 29 lower compared to i5 in 2012 and 2013 respectively hao et al 2014 reported higher et value in corn with increasing irrigation amount similarly istanbulluoglu et al 2009 also observed increased et with increasing irrigation amount in safflower and reported 673 and 232 mm during the summer and 728 and 364 during winter in full irrigation and no irrigation treatments respectively the difference in et observed in different studies could be attributed to the difference in irrigation amount prevailing weather conditions during the growing season and water extraction amounts in both years cultivars showed a significant difference in et and it was more for s333 than for pi8311 table 1 cultivar s333 and pi8311 had the et of 425 and 420 mm in 2012 and 405 and 400 mm in 2013 respectively this difference in the cultivar et could be due to the difference in the water extraction as s333 extracted 9 more soil water on average from the profile compared to pi8311 fig 9 overall the trend of et was similar in both years for preseason and in season irrigation treatments meaning in both years preseason irrigation treatment and higher in season irrigation treatments had a greater et which is due to similar amount of irrigation applications in both years and relatively similar rainfall amount in 2012 115 mm and 2013 150 mm however et values were higher in irrigation treatments as well as in cultivars during 2012 compared to 2013 this could be due to the higher total water extraction in both the preseason and in season irrigation treatment in 2012 compared to 2013 further higher vpd and well distributed rainfall throughout the growing season in 2012 compared to 2013 could have resulted in more et in 2012 wang et al 2012 also confirmed the difference in et of pulse crops due to variation in seasonal rainfall and reported the lowest and highest et in lowest and highest rainfall years respectively 3 4 water use efficiency the wue of the preseason irrigation treatment was significantly different from that of no preseason irrigation treatment in both years table 1 the wue was 30 and 114 greater in preseason irrigation treatment than no preseason irrigation treatment in 2012 and 2013 respectively the ability of safflower to extract soil moisture from deeper depth during the seed filling stage fig 4 makes it more efficient in converting biomass into seed yield singh et al 2016a safflower yield forming trait was also improved with preseason irrigation as the seed yield was 39 and 118 higher in 2012 and 2013 with preseason irrigation respectively singh et al 2016a fang et al 2010 and stone et al 1987 also reported increased wue as a result of preseason irrigation in wheat and corn respectively the wue was not significantly different among the in season irrigation treatments and cultivars in 2012 however it differed significantly in 2013 table 1 in 2012 though irrigation treatments did not show significant difference the lowest irrigation treatment had the highest wue and vice versa this result was in agreement with the study of istanbulluoglu et al 2009 who also reported the highest wue in the lowest irrigation treatment in contrast during 2013 in season irrigation treatment was significantly different and the lowest wue was observed in the lowest irrigation treatment and the highest wue in highest irrigation treatment the overall wue values in 2013 were lower compared to 2012 and it could be due to the less favorable weather conditions which is clear from uneven distribution of rainfall and lower air temperature in 2013 compared to 2012 fig 1 that resulted in poor growth and seed yield singh et al 2016a the cultivar pi8311 had more wue compared to s333 in both years the wue of pi8311 was 3 0 and 2 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 which was 3 5 and 14 2 greater compared to s333 in 2012 and 2013 respectively table 1 this reflects the potential of cultivar pi8311 to produce higher seed and oil yield per unit water used compared to s333 singh et al 2016a 3 5 oil yield the total oil yield of safflower was significantly affected by the preseason and in season irrigation treatments in both years however the difference in oil yield among the cultivars was only noticed in 2013 table 1 higher water availability in preseason irrigation treatment produced significantly higher oil yield the oil yields were 525 and 489 kg ha 1 in preseason irrigation treatment which was 41 and 128 greater than no preseason irrigation treatment in 2012 and 2013 respectively these observations were much higher than 8 30 yield increase due to preseason irrigation treatment in winter wheat and maize by fang et al 2010 also yonts et al 2018 observed a comparable amount of bean yield in severe deficit in season irrigation and full irrigation treatment in years with above average preseason precipitation similarly with increasing levels of in season irrigation from i1 to i5 oil yield significantly increased in both years the highest oil yield was recorded in i5 in season irrigation treatment which did not differ significantly from i4 irrigation treatment in both years these results suggest that increasing in season irrigation amounts from i4 to i5 may not profitably increase the oil yield in safflower among the cultivars the highest oil yield was observed in pi8311 in both years compared to s333 the oil yield in pi8311 was 459 and 371 kg ha 1 which was 4 and 12 higher than the s333 the overall oil yield in 2012 was greater than 2013 which could be due to the higher rainfall 72 mm total in the month of april and may in 2012 than in 2013 11 mm total which boosted the growth of safflower and more healthier plants produced more oil yield 4 conclusions soil water extraction patterns wue and oil yield of spring safflower were significantly affected by preseason and in season irrigation treatments safflower extracted more water from the soil profile in preseason treatment compared to no preseason treatment in both years preseason irrigation treatment significantly increased the wue which indicates the efficient nature of safflower to utilize the preseason irrigation earlier in the growing season safflower extracted more water from the upper soil profile 0 0 8 m and later in the season from the deeper profile 1 1 6 m however at the end of the growing season no difference was observed in the soil water extraction depth among the irrigation treatments these results confirmed the ability of safflower to utilize the stored soil moisture efficiently from the deeper soil profile however the amount of soil water extraction decreased with increasing in season irrigation amount results from wue and oil yield also suggest excessive in season irrigation will not benefit safflower productivity on average by limiting the in season irrigation level to i4 17 of irrigation water can be saved with a corresponding 9 reduction in oil yield further research considering additional depths can help better understand the response of safflower to the preseason and in season irrigation declaration of competing interest there is no conflict of interest among authors acknowledgments we would like to thank

10788,the deep root system of safflower carthamus tinctorius l is an important adaptive trait under rainfed conditions in semi arid agriculture lower water requirements and ability to tolerate abiotic stresses make safflower a potential alternative crop for the southern high plains shp however information on water extraction patterns of safflower and its role in oil yield formation under center pivot irrigation system that keeps only the surface soil profile wet with frequent irrigations is limited therefore a field experiment was conducted in a split plot design at clovis new mexico during 2012 and 2013 growing seasons to assess the soil water use patterns evapotranspiration and oil yield of two spring safflower cultivars under different preseason and in season irrigation levels half of the experimental units received 164 and 153 mm of preseason irrigation in 2012 and 2013 respectively while the other half remained unirrigated five in season irrigation levels i1 i5 ranging from 88 to 392 mm in 2012 and from 83 to 373 mm in 2013 were applied to preseason and no preseason irrigation blocks on average safflower extracted 70 and 28 mm of stored soil moisture in the preseason and no preseason irrigation treatments which significantly increased evapotranspiration et water use efficiency wue and oil yield in preseason compared to no preseason irrigation treatment average water extraction decreased with increasing level of in season irrigation and a decline of 32 27 and 25 in soil moisture at the end of the season compared to initial soil moisture were observed in i1 i3 and i5 respectively since wue was not much affected by in season irrigation treatment in both years limiting the in season irrigation level to i4 can save 17 of irrigation with a corresponding 9 reduction in oil yield the relatively smaller differences were observed for water extraction and wue among the cultivars overall safflower was able to use preseason irrigation water more efficiently in semi arid shp growers can pre irrigate safflower and reduce its in season irrigation to allocate more water to high water requirement traditional crops such as corn keywords evapotranspiration water use efficiency oilseed crop drought tolerant crop 1 introduction drought erratic rainfall and a decline in irrigation water availability are the main factors that limit crop productivity in arid and semi arid environments ali et al 2019 low annual precipitation 350 500 mm and high potential evapotranspiration 1500 1750 mm of semi arid southern high plains shp of the us are jeopardizing the sustainability of agriculture in the region twdb 2012 the primary source of irrigation in the shp is the ogallala aquifer which stretches from the south dakota in the north to texas in the south and is declining rapidly especially in the shp xue et al 2014 it is estimated that 2 million hectare meter of water is pumped annually from the aquifer if the current withdrawal rate continues it is projected that about 35 of currently irrigated land in the shp might shift to dryland in approximately next 15 years haacker et al 2016 this decline in pumping capacity can no longer meet the peak irrigation requirements of most of the major crops grown in the shp during the summer it is encouraging growers to use water saving strategies such as deficit irrigation site specific irrigation management scheduling irrigation based on weather and crop stage and planting crops that efficiently utilize stored soil water in root zone neupane and guo 2019 during the drought periods ability of a crop to extract soil moisture depends on the uniformity and depth of its root system the moisture left by the previous crop or moisture stored by preseason precipitation irrigation in the soil profile and amount of in season precipitation irrigation received eslam et al 2010 studies conducted on preseason irrigation also known as pre plant off season or dormant irrigation technique during the mid eighties in the diverse environmental condition showed that the preseason irrigation is not beneficial compared to in season irrigation in the humid and semi humid regions because winter precipitation could replenish a significant portion of the soil profile moisture schlegel et al 2012 however in the arid semi arid region preseason irrigation technique could be a unique strategy to render the crop from water stress especially when irrigation systems are not capable to meet the peak water requirements during in season schlegel et al 2012 stone et al 1987 even the water extracted from the deeper profile is small moisture stored from preseason can significantly buffer stress at critical growth stages of a crop and this helps in reducing the competition for in season irrigation and contributes to the yield stone et al 1987 though soil characteristic plays important role in water storage use of bubbler pad in the center pivot irrigation system one of the most widely adopted irrigation technique in the shp can considerably help store water received from preseason irrigation in deeper soil profiles hence in environments where the availability of water is variable and difficult to predict assessing the crop s ability to utilize preseason and in season irrigation and evaluating the water use pattern could better help manage the crop production crops like safflower carthamus tinctorius l with xerophytic spines on leaves and flower bracts and with deep taproot system can efficiently utilize the available soil moisture to fulfill their water requirement singh et al 2016a safflower being evolved in the arid regions of fertile crescent of the middle east has the ability to tolerate drought and heat chapman and burke 2007 depending on the soil depth safflower taproots can grow up to 2 2 m deep with numerous thin horizontal lateral roots conferring the ability to draw moisture and nutrients from a substantial depth dajue and mündel 1996 this strong rooting system enables safflower to survive in low water availability regions like the shp safflower is primarily grown for edible oil birdseed and food color omidi et al 2012 furthermore including safflower in the cropping system of the shp could 1 aid to the local vegetable oil production 2 provide an option for crop rotation to break the insects and disease cycle and 3 provide the valuable feed to livestock however very few studies are available on safflower adaptability drought response soil water use patterns and oil yield under different irrigation management practices in the semi arid shp therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of preseason and in season irrigation amounts on water use patterns and yield of spring safflower cultivars in the shp 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment description a 2 year field experiment was conducted at the new mexico state university agricultural science center clovis nm 34 35 n 103 12 w and altitude of 1348 m above mean sea level during 2012 and 2013 growing seasons the climate at clovis is semi arid with an annual average precipitation of 445 mm and the annual mean maximum and minimum temperatures of 22 c and 7 c respectively singh et al 2014 the soil at the experiment site was olton clay loam fine mixed superlative thermic aridic paleustoll soil ph was 7 7 and 7 9 and organic matter content was 1 5 and 1 6 in 2012 and 2013 respectively the experimental field was disked and plowed before planting to incorporate residue and to form a seedbed each year the field was divided into four blocks two blocks were randomly assigned to preseason irrigation and the other two were assigned to no preseason irrigation the preseason irrigation blocks received total preseason irrigation of 164 mm in 2012 and 153 mm in 2013 to recharge the soil profile exhausted by previous crops corn zea mays l and winter wheat triticum aestivum l respectively fig 1 the total preseason irrigation was applied in four splits to the preseason irrigation blocks between february and march to avoid any runoff a center pivot system with bubbler pads was used for irrigating the blocks bubbler pads helped to ensure a deeper percolation of the irrigation water while reducing wind and evaporation losses the no preseason irrigation blocks did not receive any preseason irrigation and were separated from the preseason irrigation blocks with buffer strips 1 83 3 66 m wide to keep out any irrigation water from the preseason irrigation blocks the final 25 mm of preseason irrigation before planting was applied with spray pads to all four blocks to create uniform seedbed moisture for the entire trial the experiment field was fertilized with 100 kg n ha 1 and 40 kg p2o5 ha 1 based on soil test recommendations at planting in both years a pre plant herbicide treflan hfp 2 5 l ha 1 was incorporated into the soil for weed control each year safflower was planted on 9 april 2012 and 4 april 2013 respectively using a plot drill model 3p600 great plains drill salina ks usa the target population of 625 000 plants ha 1 with 85 emergence rate was used for seed calculation the plot size was 9 4 m2 with two passes 11 rows per pass in each plot to ensure good plant stand a total of 88 and 83 mm of irrigation was applied to the entire trial over a two week period in 2012 and 2013 respectively fig 1 extremely dry warm and windy spring weather in both seasons necessitated higher amounts of establishment irrigation than planned after the safflower seedlings started emerging an above ground drip irrigation system with water meters was installed on each plot to regulate irrigation application to each experimental unit separately once the crop was well established surface drip system took over the irrigation the goal was to develop crop response to irrigation ranging from near rainfed to 300 mm of in season irrigation which is the maximum irrigation farmer in the region can afford on a crop like safflower irrigations were scheduled to meet the target amount of water assigned to a particular treatment covering all critical growth stages the scheduled irrigation was skipped when significant rainfall occurred around the time of a planned irrigation event the crop was harvested on 7 august 2012 and 13 august 2013 2 2 weather condition during the growing seasons the average values of weather variables were different during the 2012 and 2013 safflower growing season at clovis nm fig 2 the seasonal average air temperature was higher in the month of april may and july in 2012 compared to 2013 making a more favorable growing condition for safflower in the early stage however it was similar in the month of june and august in both years the cumulative daily rainfall during 2013 growing season was 150 mm which was 30 more compared to 2012 growing season even though the amount of rainfall received during 2012 was less it was well distributed throughout the growing season whereas rainfall was concentrated at the later stage of crop growth in 2013 fig 2 july and august received 83 of the growing season rainfall in 2013 which led to higher relative humidity rh in those months compared to 2012 in general july and august were the most humid months in both years vapor pressure deficit vpd values were observed higher in 2012 than in 2013 and peak vpd values were found in the month of june in both years 2 3 experimental design and statistical analysis the research project was laid out in a split plot design with three factors including preseason irrigation levels in season irrigation levels and cultivars preseason irrigation was the main factor with two levels consisting of preseason irrigation and no preseason irrigation combinations of five irrigation levels i1 i2 i3 i4 and i5 and two cultivars of different stature s333 and pi8311 were randomized into sub plots all treatment combinations were replicated four times the analysis of variance was performed using the general linear model glm procedure of sas software version 9 2 sas institute inc nc usa by using appropriate error term to evaluate each factor and their interactions the means were separated by fisher s protected least significant difference lsd test at the 0 05 probability level 2 4 data collection the volumetric soil water content cm3 cm 3 was recorded in the lowest i1 middle i3 and highest i5 in season irrigation levels from preseason as well as no preseason irrigation blocks using a field calibrated soil moisture neutron gauge model 503 dr campbell pacific nuclear inc ca usa neutron access tubes were installed in the crop rows near the center of each plot to measure soil moisture to a depth of 1 6 m neutron probe readings were made from 0 1 to 1 5 m depth at 0 2 m depth increments to assess the moisture to the depth of 1 6 m hao et al 2015 soil water content mm at each depth was calculated by multiplying depth increment mm with volumetric water content for that depth increment soil water depletion at each depth between two sampling dates was determined by subtracting the soil water content of later measurement from the earlier measurement the total water content was calculated using measurements from 0 1 to 1 6 m depth seasonal crop evapotranspiration et was calculated by summing rainfall irrigation and change in soil water content between planting and post harvest singh et al 2016b a linear relationship between irrigation and crop et was used to determine seasonal crop et for i2 and i4 irrigation levels an area of 9 2 m2 was harvested using a plot combine model elite plot 2001 wintersteiger ried austria for seed yield and weights were adjusted to 10 seed moisture singh et al 2016a water use efficiency wue was calculated as the ratio of seed yield to seasonal et hao et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of preseason irrigation 3 1 1 initial soil water content and its extraction preseason and no preseason irrigation treatments had different soil water profiles at the time of planting in both years fig 3 and preseason irrigation significantly increased soil water content over no preseason irrigation at each observation depth the total soil profile water of preseason irrigation treatment was 9 higher compared to no preseason irrigation treatment in 2012 fig 3a while this was 12 higher in 2013 fig 3b the preseason irrigation units received an approximately similar amount of preseason irrigation in both years however at planting the initial soil water content at each depth in both preseason irrigation and no preseason irrigation treatments was higher in 2012 compared to 2013 which could be due to drier winter and spring before 2013 growing season the soil profile in 2013 was extremely dry in the deeper depth especially from 1 0 to 1 6 m depth safflower extracted a significant amount of soil water at each depth down to 1 6 m profile in preseason and no preseason irrigation treatments during both growing seasons fig 4 these results suggest that water extraction depth of safflower was not influenced by preseason irrigation application singh et al 2016b also reported no difference in water extraction depth of safflower grown under water stressed and non water stressed irrigation treatments in another study hao et al 2015 observed similar water extraction depth of maize zea mays l plants in response to different water regimes the maximum depth for soil water observations in the current study is 1 6 m which might not be enough to gauge the difference of safflower water extraction depth in response to water stress as the taproot of safflower can penetrate up to depth of 2 2 m bergman and kandel 2013 dajue and mündel 1996 this makes it more interesting to examine the water extraction of safflower deeper than 1 6 m and sets a new goal for future researchers in 2012 water extraction in preseason irrigation treatment was significant up to 1 2 m depth when compared soil water content of 17 days after planting dap with 50 dap fig 4a whereas in similar comparison for no preseason irrigation treatment significant water extraction was observed up to 0 8 m depth fig 4b this shows the efficient nature of safflower roots to utilize extra water available in preseason irrigation treatment even at its early growth stages the soil water extraction at 84 dap was greater than 17 and 50 dap throughout the observed soil profile in both irrigation treatments fig 4a and b and after that the soil water depletion was minimal the period from 50 to 84 dap covered important growth stages including vegetative growth flowering and seed set which caused maximum soil profile water extraction consistent with higher evapotranspiration et requirement of safflower safflower water requirement decreased after 84 dap due to it s gradual progress to physiological maturity which was the reason for minimal water extraction during this time there was also late rains during that stage in 2012 however little bit of extraction at the lowest depth was observed indicating safflower relied on deeper soil moisture for seed filling in 2013 similar to 2012 soil water extraction was observed up to 1 2 m depth in preseason irrigation treatment when soil water content of 25 dap was compared with 62 dap fig 4c however in no preseason irrigation treatment the water extraction was significant only up to 0 6 m fig 4d the soil water extraction was greater during 62 81 dap which covered the peak vegetative growth stage of safflower and decreased after 81 dap fig 4c and d overall period from 17 to 120 dap in 2012 soil profile water depleted by 30 and 18 in preseason and no preseason irrigation treatments compared to initial soil moisture respectively similarly in 2013 period from 25 to 132 dap soil profile water depletion values were 23 and 8 in preseason and no preseason irrigation treatments respectively these results suggest that safflower on average extracted up to 26 and 13 stored soil moisture in preseason and no preseason irrigation treatments the additional water use in preseason irrigation treatment was due to greater transpiration and photosynthesis that led to greater growth of safflower over no preseason irrigation singh et al 2016a 3 1 2 cumulative soil water extraction soil moisture extraction by safflower in preseason irrigation treatment was significantly higher than no preseason irrigation treatment as the season progressed in both years fig 5 in 2012 soil water extracted by preseason and no preseason irrigation treatment until 50 dap was significant only up to the depth of 0 8 m fig 5a however it was significant throughout the 1 6 m depth profile during the period of 0 84 fig 5b and 0 120 dap fig 5c similarly hao et al 2015 also showed the water extraction from shallow depth 0 2 0 4 m in the early growth stage of corn followed by greater depth 0 8 1 0 m with progressing growth stage this increase in soil water extraction depth with progressing growing season could be due to the increase in root growth merrill et al 2002 showed that the shallow root growth in the early growing season of safflower reaching a maximum root length of 1 8 m at 90 dap in haplustolls soil total water extracted values during the period of 0 50 0 84 and 0 120 dap for preseason irrigation treatment was 21 76 and 87 mm and for no preseason irrigation treatment were 11 47 and 53 mm in 2012 respectively fig 5a b and c preseason irrigation treatment extracted 91 62 and 64 more soil moisture compared to no preseason irrigation treatment during the period of 0 50 0 84 and 0 120 dap in 2012 respectively yonts et al 2018 also observed significant water extraction in beans when the growing season received a greater amount of preseason rainfall compared to the growing season with little preseason rainfall total water extraction during the periods of 0 62 and 0 132 dap for preseason irrigation treatment was significant up to 1 2 and 1 6 m depths however for no preseason irrigation treatment it was only significant up to 0 6 and 1 4 m depth in 2013 respectively fig 5d and f the amounts of total soil water extracted during the period of 0 62 0 81 and 0 132 dap by preseason irrigation treatment were 33 57 and 53 mm and by no preseason irrigation treatment were 13 20 and 4 mm in 2013 respectively in 2012 and 2013 at the end of the growing season there was net 88 and 53 mm of soil water depletion in preseason irrigation treatment whereas only 52 and 4 mm in no preseason irrigation treatment respectively overall water extraction from soil profile was greater for preseason irrigation treatment as compared to no preseason irrigation for both years this could be due to the increased physiological activity and plant growth in preseason treatment similarly amini et al 2013 also showed the increased chlorophyll content and photosynthetic activity in safflower receiving higher irrigation amount compared to water deficit treatment 3 2 effects of in season irrigation 3 2 1 initial soil moisture and its extraction soil water content in all in season irrigation treatments decreased significantly down to 1 6 m depth irrespective of irrigation amount suggesting no variation in the water extraction depths among different in season irrigation treatments fig 6 initially moisture levels in all in season irrigation treatments were relatively similar however at the end of growing season significant decline in soil moisture was observed in i1 in season irrigation treatment compared i3 and i5 treatments in both years this indicates the ability of safflower to extract soil moisture from considerable depth when available moisture is low in 2012 there was a significant water extraction up to 1 m depth in i1 in season irrigation treatment during 17 dap when compared to 50 dap fig 6a and likewise for i3 and i5 water extraction was significant up to a depth of 0 8 and 0 6 m fig 6b and c respectively similarly in 2013 water extraction was significant up to the depth of 1 2 m in i1 in season irrigation treatment during 25 dap when compared to 62 dap fig 6d and for i3 and i5 it was only significant up to the depth of 1 m fig 6e and f hao et al 2015 also observed the greater water extraction by corn when the irrigation amount was decreased greater water depletion was observed during the period of 50 84 dap in 2012 compared to 62 81 dap in 2013 in 2012 the total water depletion values from the soil profile during the period of 50 84 dap were 44 40 and 56 mm in i1 i3 and i5 in season irrigation treatments which were 292 180 and 166 greater compared to the period of 62 81 dap in 2013 respectively fig 6 this could be due to higher vpd and more favorable temperature during the early to mid growing season in 2012 compared to 2013 fig 2 which resulted in increased physiological activity and et leading to greater water extraction 3 2 2 growth stage based soil water extraction safflower extracted more water from the upper soil layers during the early growing season vegetative growth stage and from deeper layers later in the season reproductive growth stage from all in season irrigation treatments fig 7 however plants in water deficit treatment i1 extracted soil moisture from deeper depths when compared to i3 and i5 in both years during the vegetative stage 17 50 dap in 2012 and 25 62 dap in 2013 i1 treatment extracted water up to the depth of 1 2 and 1 4 m in 2012 and 2013 fig 7a and d respectively whereas both i3 and i5 treatments extracted water up to the depth of 1 m in 2012 fig 7b and c and 1 2 m in 2013 fig 7e and f in both years safflower extracted significantly more amounts of water in i1 in season irrigation treatment followed by i3 and i5 treatments in both the growing periods the total amounts of water extracted by i1 i3 and i5 treatments during the vegetative period were 26 20 and 3 mm in 2012 and 27 23 and 19 mm in 2013 respectively during reproductive period 50 120 dap in 2012 and 62 132 dap in 2013 in 2012 40 27 and 24 mm of total soil water amounts were extracted whereas interestingly there was net recharge of 5 15 and 14 mm of soil moisture in 2013 in i1 i3 and i5 treatments respectively this recharge of soil water in 2013 is due to the greater amount of late season rainfall fig 2 which exceeded the crop water need 3 2 3 total water extraction a significant amount of soil moisture was extracted throughout the growing season at each soil depth in all in season irrigation treatments in both years fig 8 the amount of total water extracted by safflower in each in season irrigation treatment in 2012 was more than twice compared to 2013 in 2012 the total amounts of soil water depletion from beginning to the last observation 17 120 dap were 78 69 and 63 mm in i1 i3 and i5 treatments respectively fig 8a similarly the water depletion values from 25 to 132 dap in 2013 were 34 24 and 28 mm in i1 i3 and i5 treatments respectively fig 8b this indicates that on average safflower was able to extract 56 47 and 46 mm of stored soil water in i1 i3 and i5 treatments respectively this shows that the soil water extraction along the profile decreased with increasing water supply hao et al 2015 have also shown a similar result of decreasing soil water extraction from the soil profile with increasing irrigation amount in corn 3 2 4 effect of cultivars on soil water extraction both cultivars significantly extracted soil water up to the depth of 1 6 m in both years fig 9 the cultivars pi8311 extracted 158 131 and 115 mm of total soil moisture in i1 i3 and i5 irrigation treatments whereas cultivar s333 extracted 153 144 and 137 mm in 2012 respectively fig 9a c similarly in 2013 cultivar pi8311 extracted 60 35 and 64 mm of soil moisture and cultivar s333 extracted 75 35 and 47 mm of soil moisture in i1 i3 and i5 irrigation treatment fig 9d f on average cultivar s333 extracted 114 101 and 92 mm of soil moisture in i1 i2 and i3 irrigation treatments which was 5 22 and 3 greater than pi8311 respectively however no distinct pattern in water extraction was observed among the cultivars across different in season irrigation treatments in both years 3 3 evapotranspiration there were significant differences in the seasonal evapotranspiration et among the preseason irrigation treatments in season irrigation treatments and cultivars in both years table 1 the treatment that received the preseason irrigation had the highest level of et in both years the et in preseason irrigation treatment was 440 and 427 mm which was 8 6 and 12 7 greater than no preseason irrigation treatment in 2012 and 2013 respectively the irrigation applied two months prior to the planting significantly increased the available soil moisture and increased the seasonal et in preseason irrigation treatment compared to no preseason irrigation treatment a similar observation of increased et was also reported by stone et al 1987 in corn and winter wheat when the preseason irrigation was applied similarly the highest et was observed in i5 in season irrigation treatment and the lowest in i1 in season irrigation treatment in both years table 1 these results were pronounced since i5 irrigation treatment received the highest and the i1 received the lowest amount of irrigation water the et for i5 irrigation treatment was 575 and 550 mm in 2012 and 2013 respectively this et was twice as much as i1 irrigation treatment in both years the et in intermediated in season irrigation treatment i3 was 411 and 394 mm which was 44 and 47 greater than i1 and 28 and 29 lower compared to i5 in 2012 and 2013 respectively hao et al 2014 reported higher et value in corn with increasing irrigation amount similarly istanbulluoglu et al 2009 also observed increased et with increasing irrigation amount in safflower and reported 673 and 232 mm during the summer and 728 and 364 during winter in full irrigation and no irrigation treatments respectively the difference in et observed in different studies could be attributed to the difference in irrigation amount prevailing weather conditions during the growing season and water extraction amounts in both years cultivars showed a significant difference in et and it was more for s333 than for pi8311 table 1 cultivar s333 and pi8311 had the et of 425 and 420 mm in 2012 and 405 and 400 mm in 2013 respectively this difference in the cultivar et could be due to the difference in the water extraction as s333 extracted 9 more soil water on average from the profile compared to pi8311 fig 9 overall the trend of et was similar in both years for preseason and in season irrigation treatments meaning in both years preseason irrigation treatment and higher in season irrigation treatments had a greater et which is due to similar amount of irrigation applications in both years and relatively similar rainfall amount in 2012 115 mm and 2013 150 mm however et values were higher in irrigation treatments as well as in cultivars during 2012 compared to 2013 this could be due to the higher total water extraction in both the preseason and in season irrigation treatment in 2012 compared to 2013 further higher vpd and well distributed rainfall throughout the growing season in 2012 compared to 2013 could have resulted in more et in 2012 wang et al 2012 also confirmed the difference in et of pulse crops due to variation in seasonal rainfall and reported the lowest and highest et in lowest and highest rainfall years respectively 3 4 water use efficiency the wue of the preseason irrigation treatment was significantly different from that of no preseason irrigation treatment in both years table 1 the wue was 30 and 114 greater in preseason irrigation treatment than no preseason irrigation treatment in 2012 and 2013 respectively the ability of safflower to extract soil moisture from deeper depth during the seed filling stage fig 4 makes it more efficient in converting biomass into seed yield singh et al 2016a safflower yield forming trait was also improved with preseason irrigation as the seed yield was 39 and 118 higher in 2012 and 2013 with preseason irrigation respectively singh et al 2016a fang et al 2010 and stone et al 1987 also reported increased wue as a result of preseason irrigation in wheat and corn respectively the wue was not significantly different among the in season irrigation treatments and cultivars in 2012 however it differed significantly in 2013 table 1 in 2012 though irrigation treatments did not show significant difference the lowest irrigation treatment had the highest wue and vice versa this result was in agreement with the study of istanbulluoglu et al 2009 who also reported the highest wue in the lowest irrigation treatment in contrast during 2013 in season irrigation treatment was significantly different and the lowest wue was observed in the lowest irrigation treatment and the highest wue in highest irrigation treatment the overall wue values in 2013 were lower compared to 2012 and it could be due to the less favorable weather conditions which is clear from uneven distribution of rainfall and lower air temperature in 2013 compared to 2012 fig 1 that resulted in poor growth and seed yield singh et al 2016a the cultivar pi8311 had more wue compared to s333 in both years the wue of pi8311 was 3 0 and 2 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 which was 3 5 and 14 2 greater compared to s333 in 2012 and 2013 respectively table 1 this reflects the potential of cultivar pi8311 to produce higher seed and oil yield per unit water used compared to s333 singh et al 2016a 3 5 oil yield the total oil yield of safflower was significantly affected by the preseason and in season irrigation treatments in both years however the difference in oil yield among the cultivars was only noticed in 2013 table 1 higher water availability in preseason irrigation treatment produced significantly higher oil yield the oil yields were 525 and 489 kg ha 1 in preseason irrigation treatment which was 41 and 128 greater than no preseason irrigation treatment in 2012 and 2013 respectively these observations were much higher than 8 30 yield increase due to preseason irrigation treatment in winter wheat and maize by fang et al 2010 also yonts et al 2018 observed a comparable amount of bean yield in severe deficit in season irrigation and full irrigation treatment in years with above average preseason precipitation similarly with increasing levels of in season irrigation from i1 to i5 oil yield significantly increased in both years the highest oil yield was recorded in i5 in season irrigation treatment which did not differ significantly from i4 irrigation treatment in both years these results suggest that increasing in season irrigation amounts from i4 to i5 may not profitably increase the oil yield in safflower among the cultivars the highest oil yield was observed in pi8311 in both years compared to s333 the oil yield in pi8311 was 459 and 371 kg ha 1 which was 4 and 12 higher than the s333 the overall oil yield in 2012 was greater than 2013 which could be due to the higher rainfall 72 mm total in the month of april and may in 2012 than in 2013 11 mm total which boosted the growth of safflower and more healthier plants produced more oil yield 4 conclusions soil water extraction patterns wue and oil yield of spring safflower were significantly affected by preseason and in season irrigation treatments safflower extracted more water from the soil profile in preseason treatment compared to no preseason treatment in both years preseason irrigation treatment significantly increased the wue which indicates the efficient nature of safflower to utilize the preseason irrigation earlier in the growing season safflower extracted more water from the upper soil profile 0 0 8 m and later in the season from the deeper profile 1 1 6 m however at the end of the growing season no difference was observed in the soil water extraction depth among the irrigation treatments these results confirmed the ability of safflower to utilize the stored soil moisture efficiently from the deeper soil profile however the amount of soil water extraction decreased with increasing in season irrigation amount results from wue and oil yield also suggest excessive in season irrigation will not benefit safflower productivity on average by limiting the in season irrigation level to i4 17 of irrigation water can be saved with a corresponding 9 reduction in oil yield further research considering additional depths can help better understand the response of safflower to the preseason and in season irrigation declaration of competing interest there is no conflict of interest among authors acknowledgments we would like to thank

10789,water deficiency seriously restricts the agricultural production in northern china soil tillage practices can conserve water and increase yield effectively but the regional applicability of soil tillage practices has not been systematically studied so far it is significant to study the regional characteristics of tillage practices on water conserving and yield increasing so that the optimal practices for improving the crop water production and maintaining the agricultural sustainable development can be determined this study applied the meta analysis method to analyze results extracted

furrow planting 1 introduction drylands are usually defined as areas with a ratio of annual precipitation to annual potential evapotranspiration less than 0 65 and cover about 41 of earth s land surface these arid and semi arid lands are homes to more than 38 of the total global population where precipitation is mainly consumed by evaporation from land surfaces and transpiration from plants reynolds et al 2007 huang et al 2015 most drylands have infertile soil with sparse vegetation covers and thus their ecosystems are substantially more fragile and vulnerable to climate change and human activities than ecosystems in humid and semi humid regions reynolds et al 2007 in recent decades drought has become more frequent and intense in most dry areas and food production has fallen significantly in these areas while food demand has increased due to rapid population growth which led to the intensified conflict between limited water supply and increased demand on agricultural production pedrick 2012 trenberth et al 2014 elliott et al 2014 northern china is one of the typical dryland agriculture production regions and has been facing increasingly severe water scarcity with

relieve the conflict between limited water resources and increased demand on agricultural production conserving water and increasing crop yield have been two major concerns related to agricultural production in northern china manipulating tillage and mulch managements are effective ways to conserve water and improve yield for dryland farming by adjusting soil properties soil tillage practices and mulch managements not only can change water and nutrient contents within soils but also affect the process of evapotranspiration by modifying the available energy and water in the soil profile and the water and energy exchange in the plant soil atmosphere continuum which has potential to substantially improve crop yield and soil moisture conditions hussain et al 1999 hatfield et al 2001

experiments conducted at kalapara upazila of patuakhali district in bangladesh showed that plastic and straw mulching increased crop yield by 78 173 and 25 47 respectively haque et al 2018 ridge and furrow planting is one of commonly used rainwater harvesting methods by adjusting micro topography of farmland to produce accumulation of rain water in furrows carter and miller 1991 li et al 2001 and qin et al 2018 investigated a ridge furrow rainwater harvesting system with mulching to improve water availability and maize production in northwest china and showed that ridge furrow with plastic

due to ridge furrow with plastic film mulching compared with ridge furrow without mulching mo et al 2016 however since the above mentioned studies were mainly based on field experiments at the specific locations it is difficult to apply their results to evaluate the comprehensive effects of tillage practices at the large scales such as regional and national tao et al 2015 in fact the influences of the same tillage practice might be different in different regions and even some tillage practices are not suitable for certain crops or agricultural production areas the regional water conserving and yield increasing characteristics performance and suitability of soil tillage practices have not been fully studied therefore it is necessary to evaluate the regional characteristics of soil tillage practices so as to provide a scientific basis for selecting the optimal soil tillage practices which is the main goal of this study to fulfill this research goal this study employs the meta analysis an integrated statistical method to synthesize the results of independent experiments and quantitatively evaluate the effects of practices at some regional scales hedges et al 1999 the meta analysis of the relevant literature will help to draw a conclusion of the overall impacts of different tillage practices on crop yield water consumption and wue in each sub region in order to relieve the conflict between conserving the limited water resources and improving crop production the relationship between crop water consumption and yield under different soil tillage practices should be identified first such relationship is also known as the crop water production function in which crop yield is a function of the amount of water consumption e g vaux and pruitt 1983 with the established crop water production functions the optimal soil tillage practices can be determined for developing more efficient systems to allocate the limited water resources improve the wue and agricultural water productivity this study focuses on two major staple crops in northern china i e wheat and maize and applies a meta analysis to explore the effects of soil tillage practices on crop yield water consumption and wue thereby reveal the regional characteristics of soil tillage practices and further identify the suitable practices to achieve a more effective region specific agricultural management thus this study aims to i quantify the effects of different tillage practices on crop yield water consumption and wue of wheat and maize in different sub regions of northern china ii build the crop water production functions of wheat and maize under different soil tillage practices to quantify the characteristics of each tillage practice iii analyze the suitability of the different tillage practices in the three sub regions of northern china 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection a literature review of published papers was carried out to gather crop yield and water consumption data under different soil tillage practices in northern china up to december 2017 papers written in english were collected from google scholar and the web of science http apps webofknowledge com and papers written in chinese were collected from the china national knowledge infrastructure http www cnki net data collections were restricted to field experimental studies conducted in northern china including crop yield water consumption or wue under a particular type of soil tillage practice based on these conditions 156 publications were selected that included 169 field experiments 89 for wheat 80 for maize located in 62 study sites detailed information about the selected publications for data collection is listed in supplementary as shown in table s 1 according to the diverse geographic climatic conditions and natural cultivated regions of crops in northern china the study areas were divided into three sub regions 1 north central china including beijing tianjin hebei shanxi shandong and henan provinces where winter wheat summer maize double cropping system is adopted predominantly li et al 2007 spring maize is also planted in north central china mainly located in the northern areas precipitation in this region is highly variable because of the influence of the monsoon in summer and dry westerlies in winter during the winter wheat growing season precipitation ranges from 50 mm in dry years to 150 mm in wet years with an average annual precipitation of 115 9 mm which cannot meet the water demand of winter wheat liu et al 2002 due to the big gap between available rainfall and water demand of the wheat maize cropping system irrigation accounts for around 70 80 of the total consumption of water in this region liu et al 2001 xu et al 2005 2 northwest china including inner mongolia gansu ningxia and shaanxi provinces in this region the staple crops include winter wheat spring wheat spring maize and summer maize the dryland farming is the main agricultural production form due to the high temporal variability of precipitation as well as the high potential evapotranspiration of more than 1500 mm per year water has been a main limiting factor for crop production in this region li et al 2000 specially most areas of inner mongolia are grassland located in the north of the farming pastoral ecotone in northern china where ecological environments are fragile wei et al 2016 farming is hardly conducted in this region due to the shortage of water resources limited sunshine hours and the fragile environments 3 northeast china including heilongjiang jilin and liaoning provinces where spring maize is the dominant crop with the increasing temperature and declining precipitation drought has caused the severe water stress for maize production during the past decades yu et al 2014 the geographic locations of the experimental sites as well as the main tillage practices at each site are shown in fig 1 based on the literature review the major soil tillage practices used in northern china can be divided into six categories 1 conventional tillage ct as the benchmark i e planting crops on bare land keeping soil bare after harvesting crops and shallow plowing to an average depth of 10 20 cm before sowing the next crops the sowing methods plowing depth irrigation and fertilization are determined by environmental conditions crop varieties and local custom 2 no tillage nt i e planting crops on bare land without disturbing the soil usually with 30 straw returning 3 subsoiling ss i e deep scarification to an average depth of 25 40 cm is applied prior to planting of crops only loosing rather than stirring the soils 4 mulching m i e covering materials on flat land during the fallow period or crop growth period mulching materials include straw plastic film stubble and others 5 ridge and furrow planting without mulching f i e setting ridge and furrow before planting crops and sowing crop seeds in trench without mulching and 6 ridge and furrow planting with mulching f m i e setting ridge and furrow before planting crops and mulching the ridge sowing crop seeds in trench a brief sketch of each soil tillage practice is showed in fig 2 2 2 data analysis 2 2 1 water consumption total water consumption or crop evapotranspiration et in the growing season gathered from the published papers see table s 1 was calculated based on the soil water balance equation which is given as follows 1 et p i δw where p mm is precipitation i mm is the depth of irrigated water and δw mm is the change of water storage in the soil some of the reference publications only provided the data of water use efficiency wue instead of crop water consumption et the agronomic wue is calculated as follows payero et al 2008 2 wue y et where wue kg ha 1 mm 1 is the water use efficiency and y kg ha 1 is the crop yield according to eq 2 et can also be calculated as 3 et y wue 2 2 2 statistical analysis the natural logarithm of the response ratio r was employed as the effect indicator in this meta analysis hedges et al 1999 for representing the effects of each treatment which is calculated as follows 4 r xt xc 5 lnr ln xt xc lnxt lnxc where xt is the treatment value i e crop yield water consumption or wue under the nt ss m f or f m treatment and xc is the benchmark value under the ct treatment in order to avoid assigning extreme high weights to individual experiments a random effects model dersimonian and laird 1986 was utilized to assign the weight to each experiment and implemented using the openmee software wallace et al 2017 the results were presented as the percentage change r 1 100 under different treatments with a positive negative percentage change indicating an increase decrease in the variable value the mean percentage change was considered significantly positive or negative when 95 confidence interval did not overlap with zero p 0 05 2 2 3 the relationship between crop water consumption and yield to determine the optimal practice to achieve a relative high yield under limited water condition in each sub region of northern china it is essential to identify the relationship between crop water consumption and yield under different soil tillage practices the crop water production functions demonstrate the relationship between crop yield and water consumption in which crop yield is a function of the amount of consumed water with all other variables held constant can be defined as vaux and pruitt 1983 6 y f et where y is the crop yield kg ha et is the water consumption mm some research results showed that under suitable water conditions the relationship between et and y appears to be a linear relationship fao 1979 however considering the complexity and the adequacy of samples there might exist a quadratic nonlinear relationship as shown in eq 7 for a wider range of et under extreme wet conditions y will decline with increasing et as the yield reaching its maximum level chen et al 1995 liu et al 2002 it should be noted that as et is the sum of transpiration and evaporation if soil water is excessive especially near the saturation condition poor soil aeration will happen because of limited oxygen supply to the soil which will inhibit plant growth shut down plant transpiration and trigger plant mortality i e both yield and plant transpiration will decrease while the excessive water will be consumed by the enhanced evaporation and result in et increasing so that the crop water production function then can be described as 7 y aet 2 bet c where a b c are regression coefficients in the case of the quadratic behavior both the coefficients a and c will generally be negative when the function is derived from regression based on sufficient samples chen et al 1995 liu et al 2002 based on the quadratic function of y versus et y reaches its maximum value at dy det 0 8 dy det d aet 2 bet c det 2aet b 0 9 et y max b 2a where et ymax is the water consumption as crop yield is maximum the agronomic wue representing the crop production as crop consumes 1 mm of the soil water per unit area kg mm ha is calculated as follows 10 wue y et aet2 bet c et aet b c et for the function of wue versus et wue reaches its maximum value at dwue det 0 11 d wue det a c et2 0 12 et wuemax c a 1 2 where et wuemax is the water consumption as wue is maximum fig 3 is a schematic diagram illustrating the relationships between et versus y and wue as et et wuemax both y and wue increase with the increases of et in this range the amount of irrigation should be increased as long as the water supply is available for improving the crop yield as et changes from et wuemax to et ymax y increases while wue decreases with the increases of et it is the suitable water consumption interval of crop under certain treatments as both y and wue are relatively high as et varies in this range as et et ymax both y and wue decrease with the increase of et in this range the increase of the amount of irrigation would adversely affect the growth and yield of crops 3 results 3 1 impacts of soil tillage practices on crop yield water

wue were significant p 0 05 for summer maize planted in northwest china as shown in fig 5d compared with ct m and f m increased the yield by 8 1 6 9 and 14 8 10 2 respectively and reduced the water

on it were relatively weak as for the wue nt m and f m improved it by 9 5 3 9 13 8 4 3 and 7 5 5 8 respectively 3 3 the crop water production functions of wheat and maize under the conventional tillage practice ct through regressing the crop yield and water consumption data of wheat and maize under ct by the quadratic parabola function the regression coefficients for wheat and maize under the ct in the sub regions of northern china were determined then according to the determined regression functions et wuemax and et ymax were calculated based on eq 9 and eq 12 the range from et wuemax to et ymax is considered to be the suitable water consumption interval for wheat and maize considering the regional water constraints if the calculated et wuemax or et ymax was not in the range of the observed et it was replaced by the borderline et value the calculated results and the suitable water consumption interval were listed in supplementary as shown in table s 2 fig 6 a shows the crop water production functions under the ct for wheat in north central and northwest china according to fig 6a under the same amount of water consumption winter wheat planted in north central china achieved the highest yield in northwest china winter wheat yield was greater than spring wheat yield thus the wue of winter wheat in north central china was the highest and the wue of spring wheat in northwest china was the lowest fig 6b shows the crop water production functions of maize under the ct in north central china northwest china and northeast china according to fig 6b under the same level of water consumption spring maize planted in northeast china achieved the highest yield the yield of summer maize was higher than that of spring maize in north central china in northwest china as et was less than 350 mm the yield of summer maize was higher than that of spring maize as et was higher than 350 mm the yield of summer maize was lower than that of spring maize wue of summer maize was higher than that of spring maize in both north central and northwest china wue of spring maize in northeast china was the highest 3 4 the crop water production functions of wheat and maize under different soil tillage practices based on the crop yield and water consumption data of wheat and maize under different soil tillage practices the regression coefficients for wheat and maize under different soil tillage practices in the sub regions of northern china were determined as well as the suitable water consumption interval the calculated results were listed in supplementary table s 3 fig 7 shows the crop water production functions of wheat under different soil tillage practices for winter wheat in north central china as shown in fig 7a the regression function curve of nt was relatively low i e the crop yield under nt was lower than ct under the same amount of water consumption the regression function curve under m was slightly higher than that of ct as et 300 mm and lower than that of ct as et 300 mm the regression function curves of ss f and f m treatments were all higher than that of ct for winter wheat in northwest china as shown in fig 7b the regression function curve of nt was close to that of ct the regression function curves of ss f and f m were higher than that of ct as water consumption was low et 300 mm m achieved the maximum yield as water consumption was high et 300 mm f m and ss achieved higher yield for spring wheat in northwest china as shown in fig 7c the regression function curve of nt was lower than that of ct the regression function curve of m was higher than that of ct fig 8 shows the crop water production functions of maize under different soil tillage practices for summer maize in north central china as shown in fig 8a compared to ct the regression function curve of nt was relatively low while ss m and f m showed effects on increasing crop yield as water consumption was low et 350 mm m achieved the highest crop yield as water consumption varied between 350 mm and 430 mm f achieved the highest crop yield as water consumption was high et 430 mm ss achieved the highest crop yield for spring maize in north central china as shown in fig 8b the regression function curve of nt was close to that of ct and the regression function curve of ss was higher than that of ct m and f m showed effects on increasing crop yield compared to ct as water consumption was low et 370 mm crop yield under f m was higher than that under ct and m treatments as water consumption was high et 370 mm crop yield under m was higher for summer maize in northwest china as shown in fig 8c m and f m both achieved higher crop yield meanwhile consumed less water compared with ct as water consumption was between 170 mm and 270 mm f m achieved the highest yield as water consumption was between 270 mm and 370 mm m achieved the highest yield for spring maize planted in northwest china as shown in fig 8d the regression function curve of nt was close to that of ct while ss improved crop yield under the same amount of water consumption compared to ct m and f m both achieved higher crop yield compared with ct the effect of f m on promoting crop yield is more obvious for spring maize in northeast china as shown in fig 8e m and f m both showed effects on increasing crop yield under the same amount of water consumption compared to ct as water consumption was low et 380 mm crop yield under m was higher than that under ct and f m treatments as water consumption was high et 380 mm crop yield under f m was higher 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of tillage practices on crop yield water consumption and wue the main objective of tillage practices is preparing a good seedbed to ensure good subsequent plant growth ct mainly tills the surface soil which makes deep soil more compact and a hardpan is usually developed underneath the plough layer further hindering the movement of water and air inhibiting root growth and potentially reducing crop yield huang et al 2012 no tillage nt is one of the conservation agricultural practices by growing crops without disturbing soil through tillage in this study nt increased the yield of winter wheat in north central china and spring maize in northeast china by 10 8 7 0 and 8 6 3 0 respectively while the effects of nt for wheat and maize in other sub regions were not significant compared with the ct the impacts of nt on crop production are debatable nt has advantages on conserving soil water sequestrating nutrient substance in the root zone and improving microbial communities and activities de vita et al 2007 mikha et al 2013 kohl et al 2014 islam et al 2015 lal 2015 while nt also has some negative effects on crop production as it may result in low crop stands stunting seedling growth soil compaction in the row zone immobilization of nitrogen persistence of weeds e g perennial weeds and increasing incidence of pests and pathogens lal 2015 nawaz et al 2016 previous meta analysis of nt performance showed that nt significantly decreased crop yield by 5 van kessel et al 2013 and 5 7 pittelkow et al 2015 at the global scale and decreased crop yield by 2 1 1 8 in china zhao et al 2017 the results are not consistent as the effectiveness of nt depends on many different factors such as climate soil type fertilizer input and how long nt has been used zhao et al 2017 he et al 2011 found that nt can achieve much higher yield than ct in dry years experiments in southern italy also showed nt performed better with limited rainfall during the wheat growing season de vita et al 2007 soil type and climate condition also influence the effects of nt on crop yield in northeast china for maize soybean rotation system zhang et al 2015 reported that maize yield was improved under nt while chen et al 2011 found that nt significantly decreased maize yield relative to ct the opposite results of these two experiments are probably due to the different geographic and environmental conditions of the two sites a study conducted in different regions of the united states and canada showed that nt could lead to totally different impacts on crop production in different regions defelice et al 2006 i e nt tended to have greater yields than ct in the south and west regions while produced lower yields than ct in the northern u s and canada nt had better performance on increasing yield in moderate to well drained soils but slightly lowered yields in poorly drained soils defelice et al 2006 the time period of nt applied may be another factor controlling its impacts on crop production in a winter wheat summer maize cropping system in north central china a 17 year experiment showed that nt generated 30 yield increases in winter wheat liu et al 2014a another 11 year experiment showed that the average winter wheat yield under nt was only 3 5 higher than that under ct he et al 2011 the results imply that a short period of nt practice may not be adequate for soil to achieve a new equilibrium to provide beneficial effects in grain yield he et al 2011 while in the absence of cultivation a long term nt can cause soil compaction which can adversely affect root growth root uptake of water and nutrients and crop yield hill 1990 nidal 2003 although nt is a very effective erosion control measure and also can effectively reduce energy labor and machinery inputs triplett and dick 2008 its impacts on crop yield are so debatable that it is very hard to draw a comprehensive conclusion subsoiling ss is a good method to fracture compacted soil and promote root penetration by reducing soil bulk density and strength improving infiltration and water retention and increasing air entry in soil and ultimately eliminate the negative impact of soil compaction on crop growth evans et al 1996 jennings et al 2012 lampurlanés et al 2001 mohanty et al 2007 ss effectively increased soil effective porosity by 27 drewry et al 2000 soil permeability and the infiltration rate by about 2 5 times pikul and aase 1999 soil water storage was also increased by an average of 8 in 0 20 cm soil depth 19 in 20 80 cm depth and 10 in 80 120 cm depth due to the annual ss in northern china liu et al 2016 in this study ss showed a noticeable effect on improving crop yield e g wheat and maize yields were increased by 16 3 3 2 and 9 2 3 0 respectively in northern china at the same time more soil water was consumed the winter wheat yield increased by the ss treatment in north central china 16 9 3 4 was higher than that in northwest china 11 6 9 7 however ss had significantly increased the water consumption in north central china 9 4 3 6 qiang et al 2015 found that ss could increase soil water storage capacity and winter wheat yield in the north central china field experiments conducted in odemis in western turkey also showed that ss could achieve higher winter wheat yield than ct yalcin and cakir 2006 ss exhibited a significant impact on improving maize yield in all sub regions in northern china e g the summer maize yield increased by the ss treatment in north central china 12 7 5 3 was higher than that in northwest china 9 0 7 4 previous study showed that ss significantly increased maize yield by 7 78 in northern china zheng et al 2015 similarly the yield increasing effects of ss on winter wheat and spring maize in north central china was stronger than those in northwest china which might be due to the water shortage in northwest china that constrains the yield increasing effect of ss while the relatively abundant water supply irrigation in north central china might be a favorable factor for the ss treatment which can promote higher crop yield under ss 4 2 the effect of mulching practices on crop yield water consumption and wue mulching m can directly and indirectly exert positive impacts on micro climates and crop yield it can protect soil from water erosion and reduce nitrogen leaching and thus reduce soil and water loss and increase nutrient availability haraguchi et al 2004 m is an effective practice promoting water conservation by reducing et and increasing crop yields hares and novak 1992 su et al 2007 wang et al 2009 2011 it influences the soil hydro thermal conditions by increasing soil temperature and reducing soil water evaporation wang et al 2005 this study showed that m improved crop yield and conserved soil water e g overall wheat and maize yields were increased by 14 9 2 9 and 17 7 6 2 respectively in northern china and the yield increases in all sub regions were significant previous studies showed that m significantly increased both crop yield and wue by up to 60 compared with ct qin et al 2015 doubled wheat yield and wue in loess plateau qin et al 2013 and improved crop yield by 25 173 in kalapara upazila of patuakhali district bangladesh haque et al 2018 the results in this study showed that the increases in the maize yield under the m treatment were greater than the increases in the wheat yield which could be related to the larger yield potential of maize maize as a c4 crop is more efficient in photosynthesis than wheat as a c3 crop long et al 2006 considering the growing conditions maize has a much lower planting density than wheat dai et al 2014 li et al 2015 which reduces the crop shading and competition for water and sunlight in maize fields therefore m can promote maize achieving higher yield than wheat this study also found that the effects of m on crop yield varied in northern china the increases of wheat and maize yields in northwest china under m treatment were higher than those in north central china previous studies showed that m is an effective practice on promoting crop yield under limited water supply its positive impacts on yield production is pronounced in drier climates qin et al 2015 yan et al 2018 considering the climatic and irrigation conditions in north central and northwest china the water resources are relatively adequate in north central china while the water stress is stronger in northwest china and thus m performed better in northwest china than in other sub regions also the impact of m on spring maize was stronger than that on summer maize previous studies showed that plastic film mulching has advantages in terms of increasing soil temperature and water storage yan et al 2018 hou and li 2019 as air temperature during the sowing stage and growing season of spring maize is relatively low plastic film mulching can effectively improve soil temperature and promote the growth and development of spring maize 4 3 the effect of ridge and furrow planting on crop yield water consumption and wue ridge and furrow planting f has noticeable effects on improving the microenvironment for crop growth ren et al 2010 as one type of rainwater harvesting measure the f treatment can effectively improve the utilization rate of precipitation and irrigation increase soil water content in furrow and reduce water loss due to surface runoff e g the soil water content in a wheat field was increased by 3 5 10 0 under the f treatment li 2004 li and zhang 2005 in this study we found that the f practice increased the wheat yield in north central china by 5 0 1 1 and had no significant impacts on the maize yield generally the effects of f on yield improving and water conserving were relatively weak while combining ridge and furrow planting with mulching practices f m could yield a better performance on harvesting rainwater through collecting rainwater produced by light rainfall and retaining surface runoff produced by heavy rainfall thus the f m treatment has been identified as an effective approach for increasing crop water availability favoring soil microbial activity improving soil productivity increasing wue and crop yield in the drylands of northern china li et al 2001 li and gong 2002 tian et al 2003 xie et al 2005 jia et al 2006 zhang et al 2007 ren et al 2008 2010 gan et al 2013 hu et al 2014 eldoma et al 2016 therefore f m has been widely used in northwest and northeast china f m improved wheat yields by 10 2 21 4 in northern china also had a positive effect on improving maize yield by 4 2 49 8 previous studies of f m impacts on wheat production showed that it significantly increased the total dry matter amount per wheat plant and further achieved higher yield than ct ren et al 2016 li et al 2019 found that f m increased winter wheat yield and wue by 28 3 55 6 and 22 6 40 5 respectively in semi humid region of china effects of f m on winter wheat yield calculated in this study was between 10 2 21 4 zhu et al 2002 found spring wheat yields were increased by 17 6 72 8 under f m treatment in northwest china our results were in a good agreement with these experiments other studies on maize showed that f m improved water availability and increased maize production in northwest china li et al 2001 qin et al 2018 for maize based systems in north western india f m achieved 13 28 higher crop yield in comparison with ct parihar et al 2016 just like m f m also has the advantages of increasing soil temperature and reducing evaporation from soil ren et al 2008 showed that with different annual rainfall amounts i e 230 340 and 440 mm f m increased spring maize yield by 82 8 43 4 and 11 2 compared with ct wue was increased by 77 4 43 1 and 9 5 respectively it is demonstrated that the effectiveness of f m on promoting crop yield is stronger in dry years therefore f m performed better on increasing crop yield and conserving water in northwest and northeast china especially mulching with plastic film for winter wheat spring wheat and spring maize in northwest china their yield may increase more noticeable 4 4 suitable soil tillage practices for wheat and maize in sub regions of northern china northern china is facing serious shortage of water due to climate change yong 2009 piao et al 2010 in north central china the resources of heat and water are relatively abundant while the demand for water is also very high due to the winter wheat summer maize double cropping practice in every year xiong et al 2010 in northwest china the agricultural climatic resources are characterized by sufficient solar radiation and deficit precipitation with high potential evapotranspiration zhang et al 2010 coupled with lacking of irrigation conditions in northeast china the limited water and heat resources both constrain the growth of crops yu et al 2014 therefore appropriate farming practices should be selected based on the actual conditions of these specific regions based on the results of this study the appropriate tillage practices for each sub region in northern china were determined and illustrated in fig 9 ss is suitable for the winter wheat in north central china as ss can significantly improve the crop yield with adequate water supply supplementary irrigation is often applied during winter wheat growing season which can help meet the water demand of crops traditionally no irrigation is applied during summer maize growing season therefore ss is suitable for summer maize in relatively wet areas of north central china et 400 mm and m is more suitable for summer maize in relatively dry areas of north central china et 400 mm as spring maize is mainly planted in the north regions of north central china with limited heat and water resources m and f m are suitable practices for spring maize in north central china m and f m are also suitable soil tillage practices in northwest china as this region is facing a serious water shortage especially m is suitable for wheat and f m is suitable for maize in this region both m and f m have the positive effects of water conserving and yield increasing for maize in northeast china based on the crop water production functions m is more suitable for relatively dry regions et 380 mm and f m is suitable for relatively wet regions et 380 mm according to the results mulching practices i e m and f m are effective practices in water deficit areas with the social economy development the use of plastic film mulching had increased by 3 8 folds from 1991 to 2011 in china yan et al 2014 plastic films mulching performed more effectively in reducing evaporation from soil than straw mulching li et al 2013 haque et al 2018 also plastic film mulching may increase the topsoil temperature whereas the straw mulching may reduce the temperature hou and li 2019 plastic film mulching could promote growth and development of crops when they are under heat stress this is probably the reason that plastic film mulching has been widely used in production of maize wheat cotton oilseed sugar vegetable melon fruit and tobacco to improve yields save water enable earlier harvesting and reduce herbicide and pesticide use among these agricultural plants the percentage of plastic file mulching maize field is the highest especially in arid mountainous regions gan et al 2013 scarascia mugnozza et al 2011 yan et al 2014 plastic film used for mulching however are made of low density and linear low density poly ethylene that does easily biodegrade when exposed to sunlight and environmental weathering polyethylene based mulches become embrittled and difficult to be completely removed from fields resulting in gradual accumulation of plastic residues in soils which could produce negative impacts on soil texture water and nutrient transport in soils and crop growth thereby reducing crop production liu et al 2014b yan et al 2014 steinmetz et al 2016 biodegradable plastic mulch may be an alternative to polyethylene which can be decomposed into carbon dioxide water and microbial biomass however a long term study is needed to better evaluate the effects of biodegradable plastic mulch on soil health sintim et al 2016 5 conclusion in this study a meta analysis method was employed to evaluate the effects of five different tillage and mulching practices i e no tillage nt subsoiling ss mulching m ridge and furrow planting without mulching f and ridge and furrow planting with mulching f m on maize and wheat yield and wue in northern china the crop water production functions were established through regression analysis of crop yield and water consumption data extracted from 156 peer reviewed publications and the appropriate management strategies for conserving water and achieving optimal crop yields of wheat and maize in northern china were identified it was found that nt can improve winter wheat yield in the north central china and spring maize in northeast china ss improved soil conditions and had positive impacts on increasing crop yield while consuming more water m showed significant impacts on increasing crop yield and less significant impacts on the water consumption of wheat but it significantly reduced the water consumption of maize f significantly increased the yield of wheat in north central china but showed no significant yield improving effect for maize f m had noticeable promoting effects on both wheat and maize yields the results of this study also show that ss is suitable for winter wheat in north central china as well as summer maize in relatively wet regions of north central china growing season et 400 mm m is suitable for summer maize in relatively dry areas of north central china growing

10789,water deficiency seriously restricts the agricultural production in northern china soil tillage practices can conserve water and increase yield effectively but the regional applicability of soil tillage practices has not been systematically studied so far it is significant to study the regional characteristics of tillage practices on water conserving and yield increasing so that the optimal practices for improving the crop water production and maintaining the agricultural sustainable development can be determined this study applied the meta analysis method to analyze results extracted from 156 peer reviewed published papers conducted at 62 agricultural experimental sites for evaluating the effects of commonly used tillage practices i e no tillage nt subsoiling ss mulching m ridge

furrow planting 1 introduction drylands are usually defined as areas with a ratio of annual precipitation to annual potential evapotranspiration less than 0 65 and cover about 41 of earth s land surface these arid and semi arid lands are homes to more than 38 of the total global population where precipitation is mainly consumed by evaporation from land surfaces and transpiration from plants reynolds et al 2007 huang et al 2015 most drylands have infertile soil with sparse vegetation covers and thus their ecosystems are substantially more fragile and vulnerable to climate change and human activities than ecosystems in humid and semi humid regions reynolds et al 2007 in recent decades drought has become more frequent and intense in most dry areas and food production has fallen significantly in these areas while food demand has increased due to rapid population growth which led to the intensified conflict between limited water supply and increased demand on agricultural production pedrick 2012 trenberth et al 2014 elliott et al 2014 northern china is one of the typical dryland agriculture production regions and has been facing increasingly severe water scarcity with insufficient water resources to meet rising water consumption yong 2009 piao et al 2010 with only 18 of china s water resources northern china accounts for as much as 65 of the arable land and 40 of the population population census office of china 2011 in the past three decades droughts affected 35 6 of agricultural area in northern china national bureau of statistics of china 2014 in order to relieve the conflict between limited water resources and increased demand on agricultural production conserving water and increasing crop yield have been two major concerns related to agricultural production in northern china manipulating tillage and mulch managements are effective ways to conserve water and improve yield for dryland farming by adjusting soil properties soil tillage practices and mulch managements not only can change water and nutrient contents within soils but also affect the process of evapotranspiration by modifying the available energy and water in the soil profile and the water and energy exchange in the plant soil atmosphere continuum which has potential to substantially improve crop yield and soil moisture conditions hussain et al 1999 hatfield et al 2001 findeling et al 2003 now a great deal of researches has been done to explore the effects of tillage practices on crop production no tillage nt a kind of conservation tillage generally defined as planting crops in unprepared soil with 30 straw returning can effectively reduce energy labor and machinery inputs triplett and dick 2008 the nt practice is also a very effective erosion control measure while its impacts on crop yield are debatable a 17 year nt experiment conducted in northern china showed that nt generated 30 yield increases in wheat production liu et al 2014a hussain et al 1999 showed that nt increased maize yield by 15 compared with the moldboard plow treatment in southern illinois in the u s and slightly improved plant available water in soil while experiments in southern italy showed nt had contrasting consequences on grain yield depending on weather conditions i e nt performed better with limited rainfall during the wheat growing season de vita et al 2007 in a maize wheat rotation field in the southeastern buenos aires province of argentina nt led to higher soil water storage during the critical growth stage of maize and most of the wheat growing season while it generated negligible impacts on crop yield fabrizzia et al 2005 furthermore in the absence of cultivation long term nt can cause soil compaction hill 1990 and sequentially produce adverse influences on root growth uptake of water and nutrients and crop yield nidal 2003 subsoiling ss is to loose rather than stir soil which can effectively reduce soil compaction he et al 2007 showed that annual ss effectively reduced bulk density by 4 9 compared with nt treatments on the silty loam soils of the loess plateau in china for a winter wheat summer maize rotation system ss prior to winter wheat seeding could increase soil water storage capacity and crop yield in the huang huai hai plain in china qiang et al 2015 some studies found that ss significantly increased the grain yield of maize by 6 21 10 09 in xinxiang henan province of china sun et al 2017 and by 6 3 in northeastern china feng et al 2018 field experiments conducted in other countries also showed the effects of ss on yield increasing i e in the western part of turkey ss could achieve higher winter wheat yield than conventional methods yalcin and cakir 2006 in sweden ss increased spring wheat yield by 4 5 6 getahun et al 2018 mulching m is an effective practice promoting water conservation by reducing water consumption and increasing crop yields hares and novak 1992 su et al 2007 wang et al 2009 2011 a hydrological modelling study conducted in la tinaja of mexico showed that runoff was dramatically cut down by mulching through enhancing infiltration and water retention in soil findeling et al 2003 a field experiment conducted in a dryland area showed that plastic film mulching and straw mulching reduced maize water consumption by 23 9 and 5 7 respectively li et al 2013 results of aquacrop model i e a water driven crop growth for modeling crop yield as a function of water availability carried out in the loess plateau showed that reducing soil evaporation by straw or plastic film mulching could double wheat yield and wue qin et al 2013 pittelkow et al 2015 reported that crop yields increased by 7 3 in rainfed agriculture in dry climates where straw mulching and crop rotation were implemented experiments conducted at kalapara upazila of patuakhali district in bangladesh showed that plastic and straw mulching increased crop yield by 78 173 and 25 47 respectively haque et al 2018 ridge and furrow planting is one of commonly used rainwater harvesting methods by adjusting micro topography of farmland to produce accumulation of rain water in furrows carter and miller 1991 li et al 2001 and qin et al 2018 investigated a ridge furrow rainwater harvesting system with mulching to improve water availability and maize production in northwest china and showed that ridge furrow with plastic film mulching increased winter wheat yield by 28 3 55 6 and wue by 22 6 40 5 in semi humid region of china li et al 2019 for maize based systems in north western india ridge furrow with mulching achieved 13 28 higher system productivity in comparison with the conventional planting system parihar et al 2016 in semiarid kenya maize yield and wue increased by 66 5 382 and 72 9 382 respectively due to ridge furrow with plastic film mulching compared with ridge furrow without mulching mo et al 2016 however since the above mentioned studies were mainly based on field experiments at the specific locations it is difficult to apply their results to evaluate the comprehensive effects of tillage practices at the large scales such as regional and national tao et al 2015 in fact the influences of the same tillage practice might be different in different regions and even some tillage practices are not suitable for certain crops or agricultural production areas the regional water conserving and yield increasing characteristics performance and suitability of soil tillage practices have not been fully studied therefore it is necessary to evaluate the regional characteristics of soil tillage practices so as to provide a scientific basis for selecting the optimal soil tillage practices which is the main goal of this study to fulfill this research goal this study employs the meta analysis an integrated statistical method to synthesize the results of independent experiments and quantitatively evaluate the effects of practices at some regional scales hedges et al 1999 the meta analysis of the relevant literature will help to draw a conclusion of the overall impacts of different tillage practices on crop yield water consumption and wue in each sub region in order to relieve the conflict between conserving the limited water resources and improving crop production the relationship between crop water consumption and yield under different soil tillage practices should be identified first such relationship is also known as the crop water production function in which crop yield is a function of the amount of water consumption e g vaux and pruitt 1983 with the established crop water production functions the optimal soil tillage practices can be determined for developing more efficient systems to allocate the limited water resources improve the wue and agricultural water productivity this study focuses on two major staple crops in northern china i e wheat and maize and applies a meta analysis to explore the effects of soil tillage practices on crop yield water consumption and wue thereby reveal the regional characteristics of soil tillage practices and further identify the suitable practices to achieve a more effective region specific agricultural management thus this study aims to i quantify the effects of different tillage practices on crop yield water consumption and wue of wheat and maize in different sub regions of northern china ii build the crop water production functions of wheat and maize under different soil tillage practices to quantify the characteristics of each tillage practice iii analyze the suitability of the different tillage practices in the three sub regions of northern china 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection a literature review of published papers was carried out to gather crop yield and water consumption data under different soil tillage practices in northern china up to december 2017 papers written in english were collected from google scholar and the web of science http apps webofknowledge com and papers written in chinese were collected from the china national knowledge infrastructure http www cnki net data collections were restricted to field experimental studies conducted in northern china including crop yield water consumption or wue under a particular type of soil tillage practice based on these conditions 156 publications were selected that included 169 field experiments 89 for wheat 80 for maize located in 62 study sites detailed information about the selected publications for data collection is listed in supplementary as shown in table s 1 according to the diverse geographic climatic conditions and natural cultivated regions of crops in northern china the study areas were divided into three sub regions 1 north central china including beijing tianjin hebei shanxi shandong and henan provinces where winter wheat summer maize double cropping system is adopted predominantly li et al 2007 spring maize is also planted in north central china mainly located in the northern areas precipitation in this region is highly variable because of the influence of the monsoon in summer and dry westerlies in winter during the winter wheat growing season precipitation ranges from 50 mm in dry years to 150 mm in wet years with an average annual precipitation of 115 9 mm which cannot meet the water demand of winter wheat liu et al 2002 due to the big gap between available rainfall and water demand of the wheat maize cropping system irrigation accounts for around 70 80 of the total consumption of water in this region liu et al 2001 xu et al 2005 2 northwest china including inner mongolia gansu ningxia and shaanxi provinces in this region the staple crops include winter wheat spring wheat spring maize and summer maize the dryland farming is the main agricultural production form due to the high temporal variability of precipitation as well as the high potential evapotranspiration of more than 1500 mm per year water has been a main limiting factor for crop production in this region li et al 2000 specially most areas of inner mongolia are grassland located in the north of the farming pastoral ecotone in northern china where ecological environments are fragile wei et al 2016 farming is hardly conducted in this region due to the shortage of water resources limited sunshine hours and the fragile environments 3 northeast china including heilongjiang jilin and liaoning provinces where spring maize is the dominant crop with the increasing temperature and declining precipitation drought has caused the severe water stress for maize production during the past decades yu et al 2014 the geographic locations of the experimental sites as well as the main tillage practices at each site are shown in fig 1 based on the literature review the major soil tillage practices used in northern china can be divided into six categories 1 conventional tillage ct as the benchmark i e planting crops on bare land keeping soil bare after harvesting crops and shallow plowing to an average depth of 10 20 cm before sowing the next crops the sowing methods plowing depth irrigation and fertilization are determined by environmental conditions crop varieties and local custom 2 no tillage nt i e planting crops on bare land without disturbing the soil usually with 30 straw returning 3 subsoiling ss i e deep scarification to an average depth of 25 40 cm is applied prior to planting of crops only loosing rather than stirring the soils 4 mulching m i e covering materials on flat land during the fallow period or crop growth period mulching materials include straw plastic film stubble and others 5 ridge and furrow planting without mulching f i e setting ridge and furrow before planting crops and sowing crop seeds in trench without mulching and 6 ridge and furrow planting with mulching f m i e setting ridge and furrow before planting crops and mulching the ridge sowing crop seeds in trench a brief sketch of each soil tillage practice is showed in fig 2 2 2 data analysis 2 2 1 water consumption total water consumption or crop evapotranspiration et in the growing season gathered from the published papers see table s 1 was calculated based on the soil water balance equation which is given as follows 1 et p i δw where p mm is precipitation i mm is the depth of irrigated water and δw mm is the change of water storage in the soil some of the reference publications only provided the data of water use efficiency wue instead of crop water consumption et the agronomic wue is calculated as follows payero et al 2008 2 wue y et where wue kg ha 1 mm 1 is the water use efficiency and y kg ha 1 is the crop yield according to eq 2 et can also be calculated as 3 et y wue 2 2 2 statistical analysis the natural logarithm of the response ratio r was employed as the effect indicator in this meta analysis hedges et al 1999 for representing the effects of each treatment which is calculated as follows 4 r xt xc 5 lnr ln xt xc lnxt lnxc where xt is the treatment value i e crop yield water consumption or wue under the nt ss m f or f m treatment and xc is the benchmark value under the ct treatment in order to avoid assigning extreme high weights to individual experiments a random effects model dersimonian and laird 1986 was utilized to assign the weight to each experiment and implemented using the openmee software wallace et al 2017 the results were presented as the percentage change r 1 100 under different treatments with a positive negative percentage change indicating an increase decrease in the variable value the mean percentage change was considered significantly positive or negative when 95 confidence interval did not overlap with zero p 0 05 2 2 3 the relationship between crop water consumption and yield to determine the optimal practice to achieve a relative high yield under limited water condition in each sub region of northern china it is essential to identify the relationship between crop water consumption and yield under different soil tillage practices the crop water production functions demonstrate the relationship between crop yield and water consumption in which crop yield is a function of the amount of consumed water with all other variables held constant can be defined as vaux and pruitt 1983 6 y f et where y is the crop yield kg ha et is the water consumption mm some research results showed that under suitable water conditions the relationship between et and y appears to be a linear relationship fao 1979 however considering the complexity and the adequacy of samples there might exist a quadratic nonlinear relationship as shown in eq 7 for a wider range of et under extreme wet conditions y will decline with increasing et as the yield reaching its maximum level chen et al 1995 liu et al 2002 it should be noted that as et is the sum of transpiration and evaporation if soil water is excessive especially near the saturation condition poor soil aeration will happen because of limited oxygen supply to the soil which will inhibit plant growth shut down plant transpiration and trigger plant mortality i e both yield and plant transpiration will decrease while the excessive water will be consumed by the enhanced evaporation and result in et increasing so that the crop water production function then can be described as 7 y aet 2 bet c where a b c are regression coefficients in the case of the quadratic behavior both the coefficients a and c will generally be negative when the function is derived from regression based on sufficient samples chen et al 1995 liu et al 2002 based on the quadratic function of y versus et y reaches its maximum value at dy det 0 8 dy det d aet 2 bet c det 2aet b 0 9 et y max b 2a where et ymax is the water consumption as crop yield is maximum the agronomic wue representing the crop production as crop consumes 1 mm of the soil water per unit area kg mm ha is calculated as follows 10 wue y et aet2 bet c et aet b c et for the function of wue versus et wue reaches its maximum value at dwue det 0 11 d wue det a c et2 0 12 et wuemax c a 1 2 where et wuemax is the water consumption as wue is maximum fig 3 is a schematic diagram illustrating the relationships between et versus y and wue as et et wuemax both y and wue increase with the increases of et in this range the amount of irrigation should be increased as long as the water supply is available for improving the crop yield as et changes from et wuemax to et ymax y increases while wue decreases with the increases of et it is the suitable water consumption interval of crop under certain treatments as both y and wue are relatively high as et varies in this range as et et ymax both y and wue decrease with the increase of et in this range the increase of the amount of irrigation would adversely affect the growth and yield of crops 3 results 3 1 impacts of soil tillage practices on crop yield water

water production functions under the ct for wheat in north central and northwest china according to fig 6a under the same amount of water consumption winter wheat planted in north central china achieved the highest yield in northwest china winter wheat yield was greater than spring wheat yield thus the wue of winter wheat in north central china was the highest and the wue of spring wheat in northwest china was the lowest fig 6b shows the crop water production functions of maize under the ct in north central china northwest china and northeast china according to fig 6b under the same level of water consumption spring maize planted in northeast china achieved the highest yield the yield of summer maize was higher than that of spring maize in north central china in northwest china

1 the effects of tillage practices on crop yield water consumption and wue the main objective of tillage practices is preparing a good seedbed to ensure good subsequent plant growth ct mainly tills the surface soil which makes deep soil more compact and a hardpan is usually developed underneath the plough layer further hindering the movement of water and air inhibiting root growth and potentially reducing crop yield huang et al 2012 no tillage nt is one of the conservation agricultural practices by growing crops without disturbing soil through tillage in this study nt increased the yield of winter wheat in north central china and spring maize in northeast china by 10 8 7 0 and 8 6 3 0 respectively while the effects of nt for wheat and maize in other sub regions were not significant compared with the ct the impacts of nt on crop production are debatable nt has advantages on conserving soil water sequestrating nutrient substance in the root zone and improving microbial communities and activities de vita et al 2007 mikha et al 2013 kohl et al 2014 islam et al 2015 lal 2015 while nt also has some negative effects on crop production as it may result in low crop stands stunting seedling growth soil compaction in the row zone immobilization of nitrogen persistence of weeds e g perennial weeds and increasing incidence of pests and pathogens lal 2015 nawaz et al 2016 previous meta analysis of nt performance showed that nt significantly decreased crop yield by 5 van kessel et al 2013 and 5 7 pittelkow et al 2015 at the global scale and decreased crop yield by 2 1 1 8 in china zhao et al 2017 the results are not consistent as the effectiveness of nt depends on many different factors such as climate soil type fertilizer input and how long nt has been used zhao et al 2017 he et al 2011 found that nt can achieve much higher yield than ct in dry years experiments in southern italy also showed nt performed better with limited rainfall during the wheat growing season de vita et al 2007 soil type and climate condition also influence the effects of nt on crop yield in northeast china for maize soybean rotation system zhang et al 2015 reported that maize yield was improved under nt while chen et al 2011 found that nt significantly decreased maize yield relative to ct the opposite results of these two experiments are probably due to the different geographic and environmental conditions of the two sites a study conducted in different regions of the united states and canada showed that nt could lead to totally different impacts on crop production in different regions defelice et al 2006 i e nt tended to have greater yields than ct in the south and west regions while produced lower yields than ct in the northern u s and canada nt had better performance on increasing yield in moderate to well drained soils but slightly lowered yields in poorly drained soils defelice et al 2006 the time period of nt applied may be another factor controlling its impacts on crop production in a winter wheat summer maize cropping system in north central china a 17 year experiment showed that nt generated 30 yield increases in winter wheat liu et al 2014a another 11 year experiment showed that the average winter wheat yield under nt was only 3 5 higher than that under ct he et al 2011 the results imply that a short period of nt practice may not be adequate for soil to achieve a new equilibrium to provide beneficial effects in grain yield he et al 2011 while in the absence of cultivation a long term nt can cause soil compaction which can adversely affect root growth root uptake of water and nutrients and crop yield hill 1990 nidal 2003 although nt is a very effective erosion control measure and also can effectively reduce energy labor and machinery inputs triplett and dick 2008 its impacts on crop yield are so debatable that it is very hard to draw a comprehensive conclusion subsoiling ss is a good method to fracture compacted soil and promote root penetration by reducing soil bulk density and strength improving infiltration and water retention and increasing air entry in soil and ultimately eliminate the negative impact of soil compaction on crop growth evans et al 1996 jennings et al 2012 lampurlanés et al 2001 mohanty et al 2007 ss effectively increased soil effective porosity by 27 drewry et al 2000 soil permeability and the infiltration rate by about 2 5 times pikul and aase 1999 soil water storage was also increased by an average of 8 in 0 20 cm soil depth 19 in 20 80 cm depth and 10 in 80 120 cm depth due to the annual ss in northern china liu et al 2016 in this study ss showed a noticeable effect on improving crop yield e g wheat and maize yields were increased by 16 3 3 2 and 9 2 3 0 respectively in northern china at the same time more soil water was consumed the winter wheat yield increased by the ss treatment in north central china 16 9 3 4 was higher than that in northwest china 11 6 9 7 however ss had significantly increased the water consumption in north central china 9 4 3 6 qiang et al 2015 found that ss could increase soil water storage capacity and winter wheat yield in the north central china field experiments conducted in odemis in western turkey also showed that ss could achieve higher winter wheat yield than ct yalcin and cakir 2006 ss exhibited a significant impact on improving maize yield in all sub regions in northern china e g the summer maize yield increased by the ss treatment in north central china 12 7 5 3 was higher than that in northwest china 9 0 7 4 previous study showed that ss significantly increased maize yield by 7 78 in northern china zheng et al 2015 similarly the yield increasing effects of ss on winter wheat and spring maize in north central china was stronger than those in northwest china which might be due to the water shortage in northwest china that constrains the yield increasing effect of ss while the relatively abundant water supply irrigation in north central china might be a favorable factor for the ss treatment which can promote higher crop yield under ss 4 2 the effect of mulching practices on crop yield water consumption and wue mulching m can directly and indirectly exert positive impacts on micro climates and crop yield it can protect soil from water erosion and reduce nitrogen leaching and thus reduce soil and water loss and increase nutrient availability haraguchi et al 2004 m is an effective practice promoting water conservation by reducing et and increasing crop yields hares and novak 1992 su et al 2007 wang et al 2009 2011 it influences the soil hydro thermal conditions by increasing soil temperature and reducing soil water evaporation wang et al 2005 this study showed that m improved crop yield and conserved soil water e g overall wheat and maize yields were increased by 14 9 2 9 and 17 7 6 2 respectively in northern china and the yield increases in all sub regions were significant previous studies showed that m significantly increased both crop yield and wue by up to 60 compared with ct qin et al 2015 doubled wheat yield and wue in loess plateau qin et al 2013 and improved crop yield by 25 173 in kalapara upazila of patuakhali district bangladesh haque et al 2018 the results in this study showed that the increases in the maize yield under the m treatment were greater than the increases in the wheat yield which could be related to the larger yield potential of maize maize as a c4 crop is more efficient in photosynthesis than wheat as a c3 crop long et al 2006 considering the growing conditions maize has a much lower planting density than wheat dai et al 2014 li et al 2015 which reduces the crop shading and competition for water and sunlight in maize fields therefore m can promote maize achieving higher yield than wheat this study also found that the effects of m on crop yield varied in northern china the increases of wheat and maize yields in northwest china under m treatment were higher than those in north central china previous studies showed that m is an effective practice on promoting crop yield under limited water supply its positive impacts on yield production is pronounced in drier climates qin et al 2015 yan et al 2018 considering the climatic and irrigation conditions in north central and northwest china the water resources are relatively adequate in north central china while the water stress is stronger in northwest china and thus m performed better in northwest china than in other sub regions also the impact of m on spring maize was stronger than that on summer maize previous studies showed that plastic film mulching has advantages in terms of increasing soil temperature and water storage yan et al 2018 hou and li 2019 as air temperature during the sowing stage and growing season of spring maize is relatively low plastic film mulching can effectively improve soil temperature and promote the growth and development of spring maize 4 3 the effect of ridge and furrow planting on crop yield water consumption and wue ridge and furrow planting f has noticeable effects on improving the microenvironment for crop growth ren et al 2010 as one type of rainwater harvesting measure the f treatment can effectively improve the utilization rate of precipitation and irrigation increase soil water content in furrow and reduce water loss due to surface runoff e g the soil water content in a wheat field was increased by 3 5 10 0 under the f treatment li 2004 li and zhang 2005 in this study we found that the f practice increased the wheat yield in north central china by 5 0 1 1 and had no significant impacts on the maize yield generally the effects of f on yield improving and water conserving were relatively weak while combining ridge and furrow planting with mulching practices f m could yield a better performance on harvesting rainwater through collecting rainwater produced by light rainfall and retaining surface runoff produced by heavy rainfall thus the f m treatment has been identified as an effective approach for increasing crop water availability favoring soil microbial activity improving soil productivity increasing wue and crop yield in the drylands of northern china li et al 2001 li and gong 2002 tian et al 2003 xie et al 2005 jia et al 2006 zhang et al 2007 ren et al 2008 2010 gan et al 2013 hu et al 2014 eldoma et al 2016 therefore f m has been widely used in northwest and northeast china f m improved wheat yields by 10 2 21 4 in northern china also had a positive effect on improving maize yield by 4 2 49 8 previous studies of f m impacts on wheat production showed that it significantly increased the total dry matter amount per wheat plant and further achieved higher yield than ct ren et al 2016 li et al 2019 found that f m increased winter wheat yield and wue by 28 3 55 6 and 22 6 40 5 respectively in semi humid region of china effects of f m on winter wheat yield calculated in this study was between 10 2 21 4 zhu et al 2002 found spring wheat yields were increased by 17 6 72 8 under f m treatment in northwest china our results were in a good agreement with these experiments other studies on maize showed that f m improved water availability and increased maize production in northwest china li et al 2001 qin et al 2018 for maize based systems in north western india f m achieved 13 28 higher crop yield in comparison with ct parihar et al 2016 just like m f m also has the advantages of increasing soil temperature and reducing evaporation from soil ren et al 2008 showed that with different annual rainfall amounts i e 230 340 and 440 mm f m increased spring maize yield by 82 8 43 4 and 11 2 compared with ct wue was increased by 77 4 43 1 and 9 5 respectively it is demonstrated that the effectiveness of f m on promoting crop yield is stronger in dry years therefore f m performed better on increasing crop yield and conserving water in northwest and northeast china especially mulching with plastic film for winter wheat spring wheat and spring maize in northwest china their yield may increase more noticeable 4 4 suitable soil tillage practices for wheat and maize in sub regions of northern china northern china is facing serious shortage of water due to climate change yong 2009 piao et al 2010 in north central china the resources of heat and water are relatively abundant while the demand for water is also very high due to the winter wheat summer maize double cropping practice in every year xiong et al 2010 in northwest china the agricultural climatic resources are characterized by sufficient solar radiation and deficit precipitation with high potential evapotranspiration zhang et al 2010 coupled with lacking of irrigation conditions in northeast china the limited water and heat resources both constrain the growth of crops yu et al 2014 therefore appropriate farming practices should be selected based on the actual conditions of these specific regions based on the results of this study the appropriate tillage practices for each sub region in northern china were determined and illustrated in fig 9 ss is suitable for the winter wheat in north central china as ss can significantly improve the crop yield with adequate water supply supplementary irrigation is often applied during winter wheat growing season which can help meet the water demand of crops traditionally no irrigation is applied during summer maize growing season therefore ss is suitable for summer maize in relatively wet areas of north central china et 400 mm and m is more suitable for summer maize in relatively dry areas of north central china et 400 mm as spring maize is mainly planted in the north regions of north central china with limited heat and water resources m and f m are suitable practices for spring maize in north central china m and f m are also suitable soil tillage practices in northwest china as this region is facing a serious water shortage especially m is suitable for wheat and f m is suitable for maize in this region both m and f m have the positive effects of water conserving and yield increasing for maize in northeast china based on the crop water production functions m is more suitable for relatively dry regions et 380 mm and f m is suitable for relatively wet regions et 380 mm according to the results mulching practices i e m and f m are effective practices in water deficit areas with the social economy development the use of plastic film mulching had increased by 3 8 folds from 1991 to 2011 in china yan et al 2014 plastic films mulching performed more effectively in reducing evaporation from soil than straw mulching li et al 2013 haque et al 2018 also plastic film mulching may increase the topsoil temperature whereas the straw mulching may reduce the temperature hou and li 2019 plastic film mulching could promote growth and development of crops when they are under heat stress this is probably the reason that plastic film mulching has been widely used in production of maize wheat cotton oilseed sugar vegetable melon fruit and tobacco to improve yields save water enable earlier harvesting and reduce herbicide and pesticide use among these agricultural plants the percentage of plastic file mulching maize field is the highest especially in arid mountainous regions gan et al 2013 scarascia mugnozza et al 2011 yan et al 2014 plastic film used for mulching however are made of low density and linear low density poly ethylene that does easily biodegrade when exposed to sunlight and environmental weathering polyethylene based mulches become embrittled and difficult to be completely removed from fields resulting in gradual accumulation of plastic residues in soils which could produce negative impacts on soil texture water and nutrient transport in soils and crop growth thereby reducing crop production liu et al 2014b yan et al 2014 steinmetz et al 2016 biodegradable plastic mulch may be an alternative to polyethylene which can be decomposed into carbon dioxide water and microbial biomass however a long term study is needed to better evaluate the effects of biodegradable plastic mulch on soil health sintim et al 2016 5 conclusion in this study a meta analysis method was employed to evaluate the effects of five different tillage and mulching practices i e no tillage nt subsoiling ss mulching m ridge and furrow planting without mulching f and ridge and furrow planting with mulching f m on maize and wheat yield and wue in northern china the crop water production functions were established through regression analysis of crop yield and water consumption data extracted from 156 peer reviewed publications and the appropriate management strategies for conserving water and achieving optimal crop yields of wheat and maize in northern china were identified it was found that nt can improve winter wheat yield in the north central china and spring maize in northeast china ss improved soil conditions and had positive impacts on increasing crop yield while consuming more water m showed significant impacts on increasing crop yield and less significant impacts on the water consumption of wheat but it significantly reduced the water consumption of maize f significantly increased the yield of wheat in north central china but showed no significant yield improving effect for maize f m had noticeable promoting effects on both wheat and maize yields the results of this study also show that ss is suitable for winter wheat in north central china as well as summer maize in relatively wet regions of north central china growing season et 400 mm m is suitable for summer maize in relatively dry areas of north central china growing season et 400 mm m and f m are suitable for spring maize in north central china as well as crops in northwest and northeast china in northwest china m is more suitable for wheat and f m is more suitable for maize in northeast china m is suitable for relatively dry regions growing season et 380 mm and f m is suitable for relatively wet regions growing season et 380 mm acknowledgements this
