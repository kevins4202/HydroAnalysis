10925,water scarcity has always been a serious challenge for agriculture and food security hence different strategies are considered to save more water and increase water productivity however the effectiveness of such water saving measures have not been sufficiently evaluated in addition they may have side effects like salt accumulation which will be exacerbated in dry and semi arid zones so any evaluation needs to be done in an integrated framework thus this work aims to evaluate some of the most popular agricultural water management measures from the points of view of real water saving water productivity soil salinity and environmental flow such an evaluation requires both field and basin scale simulations to this aim a modelling setup was defined to estimate the components of crop growth yield evaporation and transpiration as well as water and salt budgets using the swat and aquacrop models the evaluated measures include deficit irrigation replacing surface irrigation with drip irrigation and greenhouse cultivation the study area of this research work is a part of the tashk bakhtegan basin located in the fars province of iran the results show that deficit irrigation can save water up to 12 but it would also cause up to 94 more salt accumulation than surface irrigation notably implementation of improved irrigation systems like drip irrigation can increase water consumption up to 8 and still have nearly the same problem with salt accumulation among the assessed measures greenhouse cultivation resulted in an up to 24 reduction in water consumption with no serious salt accumulation while it was assumed that the rebound effects of measures are controlled it was seen in the study area that these measures can lead to an illusion of reducing water consumption due to consequent increases in cultivated area or changing to more water consuming crop patterns this ultimately reduces groundwater recharge or environmental flow that have been traditionally supplied by irrigation return flows keywords real water saving soil salinity swat aquacrop marvdasht kharame 1 introduction water scarcity poses a serious threat to agriculture and global food security therefore agricultural water saving is the most important strategy to overcoming water resource scarcity ruisen et al 2009 however any measures intended to save water should first be evaluated in an integrated framework in which their effects e g their capacity for saving water increases in water productivity and side effects e g return flows and soil salinity are examined otherwise as divine 1999 warned implementing conservation programs could merely reallocate water from one use to another scott et al 2014 expressed that in some cases policies intended to save water can actually deplete it similarly törnqvist and jarsjö 2012 found that increasing irrigation efficiency rarely saves water to look more realistically at water conservation measures and prevent some of the misunderstandings and misinterpretations that are common for irrigation efficiency scott et al 2014 the term real water saving rws has been introduced keller and keller 1995 defined rws as reduction of waste of water in one area to free it up for beneficial use and emphasizes reduction of water depletion e g decreasing evaporation instead of water withdrawal therefore rws has both economical and hydrological aspects in recent literature reduction of evapotranspiration is given the most attention bastiaanssen et al 2008 karimov et al 2012 in explanations of rws the scale of application is also an important issue seckler 1999 emphasized that some positive field scale results may have negative outcomes at a basin scale for example increasing on farm irrigation application efficiency from 30 to 80 percent e g changing conventional surface irrigation to drip irrigation may reduce water withdrawal at the field scale but at a basin scale perspective the lost water from low irrigation efficiency can be recharged through return flows perry 1999 perry et al 2017 which can have important role in meeting environmental flows scott et al 2014 soil leaching requirements jägermeyr et al 2015 and groundwater recharge ward et al 2008 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 call it valuable return flow due to this multi functionality in assessments of rws it is recommended to compare on farm irrigation efficiency versus basin irrigation efficiency for instance these are 40 and 78 respectively in the lake urmia basin farokhni et al 2019 and 30 and 80 in the nile basin qureshi et al 2010 high basin irrigation efficiency means that water saving measures can t be very effective this situation is called a closed basin seckler 1996 therefore if the scaling of water saving measures is insufficiently considered measures can lead to increased water consumption kulkarni 2011 increased vulnerability of groundwater resources ward et al 2008 and decreased sustainability scott et al 2014 soil salinity is another issue that needs more attention while considering water saving measures per our literature review simultaneous assessment of water saving soil salinity and their interactions is rarely carried out zhao et al 2011 however evaluated the impact of water saving measures on salinity in a dry region of china using numerical simulations they showed that water saving scenarios may lead to salt accumulation among the water saving options improving pressurized irrigation systems is the technology being most considered kulkarni 2011 törnqvist and jarsjö 2012 investigated basin scale hydrological impacts of irrigation technique improvements by using a distributed hydrologic model in the aral sea drainage basin of central asia results showed that improved irrigation techniques can lead to basin scale water savings between 1 and 6 km3 year farokhni et al 2019 evaluated the impact of improving irrigation efficiency on inflow to lake urmia iran they showed that this measure can increase water inflow to the lake but it also decreases groundwater recharge deficit irrigation is another water saving strategy it involves applying less irrigation than the full crop water requirement costa et al 2007 kiziloglu et al 2006 evaluated the effect of deficit irrigation on potato yield their experiment included six water deficits 0 full irrigation 20 40 60 80 and 100 rainfed the seasonal evapotranspiration was found to be 445 2 mm in the full irrigated and 195 2 mm for non irrigated while the yields were 26 43 ton ha and 8 28 ton ha respectively in fact water stress reduced evapotranspiration and potato yield but water can be saved in terms of yield per unit of water used in irrigation greenhouses are also a possibility for water saving the use of greenhouses decreases crop water requirements by reducing evapotranspiration because the plastic cover changes the radiation balance by entrapping long wave radiation and also creates a barrier to moisture loss tipis and mpusia 2006 it reduces the non beneficial component of evapotranspiration evaporation from soil fernandes et al 2003 reported that evapotranspiration inside a greenhouse is around 60 to 80 of outside evapotranspiration to simulate the aforementioned measures the most popular model is aquacrop steduto et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 the model is field scale and is used to simulate crop growth jin et al 2014 different agricultural water management scenarios greaves and wang 2016 pawar et al 2017 nyathi et al 2018 ket et al 2018 drainage management zabihi et al 2015 and soil salinity el mokh et al 2017 for basin scale modeling the soil and water assessment tool swat is a well known model arnold et al 1993 it is also considered for rws analyses for instance lei et al 2015 used it to assess a number of management scenarios for rws in the north plain of china the assessed scenarios included deficit irrigation crop pattern change and irrigation water source change however swat doesn t have a soil salinity component and none of the models simulate greenhouse conditions this paper attempts to evaluate a number of popular water saving measures in an integrated framework in which effects and side effects of measures are considered in evaluations the modeling setup links swat and aquacrop so that different field and basin scale criteria e g return flows rws crop productivity soil salt budget are simultaneously simulated due to the swat code being open source deficits of simulation like greenhouse can be added to the model to show the methodology for doing so tashk bakhtegan basin and its most important plain marvdasht kharame iran are used as the study area 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data marvdasht kharame is the most important intermediate subbasin of tashk bakhtegan basin with a total area of 3942 km2 the subbasin is located between longitudes 45 47 and 47 20 north and between latitudes 35 41 and 37 27 east fig 1 the average annual rainfall in the basin is 360 mm and its irrigated cultivation area is 107595 ha this subbasin ends at the tashk bakhtegan lakes fig 1 the water requirements of these two lakes are mainly met by the return flows of agricultural lands weather input data were obtained from the iranian meteorological organization imo for six stations that are located in the basin also streamflow data required for calibration and validation of the model were obtained from the ministry of energy of iran table 1 and fig 1 show the specifications and locations of the gauging stations used in the study 1990 2008 the growing season in the subbasin is from mid spring to mid autumn and water requirements are mainly met from groundwater resources the region s irrigation efficiency varies from 40 for surface systems to 80 for drip systems major crops are wheat barley alfalfa potato tomato sugar beet and onion the agricultural information including cropping pattern planting and harvesting dates irrigation management cultivated area of major crops and fertilizer uses are provided from the fars jahade agriculture organization fjao the field scale part of this paper focuses more on wheat and tomato and the related information is shown in table 2 palnt parameters of wheat phonological stages also is presented in table 3 2 2 water saving measures among the various water saving measures deficit irrigation df drip irrigation dp and development of greenhouse gh cultivation are investigated and compared with surface irrigation si as the base scenario the region s gross water requirements and efficiencies of surface and drip irrigation systems are 1000 mm and 745 mm and 42 and 80 respectively also irrigation duration was set as 10 days and 2 days for surface and drip irrigation systems respectively based on local practices furthermore for implementation of deficit irrigation different scenarios including deficits of 20 40 and 50 with respect to the conventional irrigation depth i e 1000 mm ha are used same ratios are also applied by lei et al 2015 2 3 modeling setup and descriptions df and dp are applied for wheat cultivation and gh is applied for tomato cultivation also the selected criteria for evaluation of the measures include real water saving reduction of actual evaporation c1 return flows at field and basin scale outlet of the subbasin c2 crop yield c3 water productivity c4 and soil salinity accumulation c5 c1 c3 and c4 are considered as effects and the rest are side effects to simulate the measures and estimate the criteria both aquacrop and swat models are applied for more clarification to evaluate df and dp measures aquacrop is applied to estimate c1 c2 at the field scale c3 c4 and c5 however swat is needed to estimate c2 at the basin scale for this the model was separately run applying df and dp in the management of all hrus under wheat cultivation for gh none of the models has this management so this option was added to swat see next section then all the hrus with field cultivation of tomato were converted to greenhouse and the c1 to c4 criteria were evaluated salinity or c4 is neglected for gh fig 2 illustrates the aforementioned tools measures criteria and their interrelationships to address the objectives of this research work 2 3 1 aquacrop aquacrop is a software system developed by the land and water division of fao 2009 in order to increase water efficiency practices in agricultural production trombetta et al 2016 the model calculates the daily soil water balance and describes the interactions between plants and the soil the soil water balance is the sum of the ingoing fluxes rainfall irrigation and capillary rise and outgoing fluxes evaporation and transpiration runoff and deep percolation lievens 2014 the root zone is mathematically described as a reservoir the change of the water content in the soil profile is obtained by the soil water balance equation 1 w r t 1 w r t p r o i c r e t r d p where w r t and w r t 1 are the water contents in the root zone at times t and t 1 deep percolation losses dp will occur if after significant rainfall or excessive irrigation w r exceeds field capacity as shown in eq 1 the model calculates separately evaporation and transpiration components allen et al 1998 furthermore the effect of water stress on crop growth are segregated into four components canopy growth canopy senescence tr and harvest index hi akumaga et al 2017 one of the most important parameters used in aquacrop is the normalized water productivity wp which tends to be constant regardless of climatic conditions steduto et al 2009 using this parameter and the ratio of the cumulative amount of water transpired t r to reference evapotranspiration eto the biomass production b is estimated as follows 2 b w p t r i e t o i final crop yield y is simulated by multiplying b by a harvest index hi which expresses the mass of the harvested product as a percentage of the total above ground biomass b 3 y h i b to estimate the reduction of crop yield due salinity it uses the average seasonal saturated soil paste extract ece in the root zone as an indicator and then uses following equation el mokh et al 2017 4 b 100 1 kssalt where kssalt is the salinity stress coefficient determined by the average electrical conductivity of ece 2 3 2 swat the soil and water assessment tool swat has been developed by the usda agricultural research service liu et al 2016 swat is a physical semi distributed hydrological model that can operate under different climate conditions and land use change scenarios ruan et al 2017 this model is a process based continuous hydrological model ahmadzadeh et al 2016 the swat model was developed to predict the impact of land management practices on water sediment and agricultural chemical yield in large complex watersheds with varying soils land use and management conditions over long periods of time arnold et al 2012 for this research work a modified version of swat was developed for tashk bakhtegan basin called swat fars delavar et al 2017 this version is enhanced with the wa water accounting karimi et al 2013 so the depletion of water is considered to be very crucial for rws more details about swat fars are available in delavar and morid 2016 2 3 2 1 embedding greenhouse management greenhouse management is not originally defined in swat nor in swat fars so it was necessary to add it to the model the most important modifications in this regard are 1 estimation of evapotranspiration et in greenhouse situation and 2 hydrological factors like runoff and infiltration with respect to greenhouse situations 2 3 2 1 1 evapotranspiration in greenhouse accurate estimation of et is a key parameter in the crop management of greenhouses with this aim the stanghellini model 1987 was applied this model is the revised version of the penman montieth equation based on the status of air velocities in greenhouses usually low and less than 1 m s 1 5 e t 2 l a i 1 λ s r n g k t v p d ρ c p r r s γ 1 r c r a 6 r n 0 07 r n s 252 ρ c p t t 0 r r r n s 0 77 r s 7 r r ρ c p 4 σ t 273 15 3 where e t is reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 r n is net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 k t is unit conversion factor equal to 3600 s h 1 vpd is daily or hourly vapor pressure deficit kpa ρ is mean atmospheric density kg m 3 c p is specific heat of the air mj kg 1 1 r r is radiative resistance s m 1 r c is canopy resistance s m 1 r a is aerodynamic resistance s m 1 λ is latent heat of vaporization mj kg 1 s is slope of the saturation vapour pressure curve kpa 1 γ is psychrometric constant kpa 1 and lai is leaf area index m2 m 2 potential evapotranspiration corrections were applied in the etpot f subroutine to do this it was necessary to correct or add to the equations some other parameters including net radiation at the crop surface r n net short wave radiation r n s leaf temperature to and radiative resistance r r this equation is verified by comparing the actual evapotranspiration of the greenhouse with that of fields as mentioned before evapotranspiration in greenhouse cultivation is 60 85 of that for open cultivation as will be shown this rate is about 76 in our study area this method was included in the etpot f subroutine as a new method in addition to penman montieth hargreaves and priestly taylor methods 2 3 2 1 2 runoff and infiltration considering the impenetrability of greenhouses and the resulting impact on hru runoff and percolation rate the following changes were made 1 the soil layer in the subroutine of perc f was considered zero 2 the curve number for hrus with greenhouse management was set as 100 file mgt 2 3 2 1 3 radiation and vapor pressure deficit other parameters that are considered include radiation and vapor pressure deficit vpd by entrapping long wave radiation greenhouses change the energy balance including net radiation from the sun transfer of heat and vapor from a canopy and crop evapotranspiration fazlil ilahil 2009 furthermore greenhouses reduce evapotranspiration by blocking wind increasing relative humidity and decreasing the solar radiation that reaches the plants o connor and mehta 2016 for the required simulations radiation and vpd corrections are applied in the grow f subroutine of the swat model this subroutine applies beer s law to calculate intercepted photosynthetically active radiation on a given day h p h o s y n the cover of greenhouse potentially changes the physical properties of the surface area and its albedo therefore it potentially affects the ratio of intercepted radiation of greenhouse comparing with open field fan et al 2015 showed this ratio is about 0 1 in plastic film greenhouses so h p h o s y n is adjusted based on the field α 0 3 and greenhouse α 0 7 albedo in our study shamshiri 2007 romullus 2014 furthermore the subroutine includes two equations to calculate a plant s radiation use efficiency rue one is used when vpd 1 and the other when vpd 1 in greenhouses vpd is smaller than 1 li 2015 so the second equation is applied it is recommended to review stockle and kiniry 1990 for more details about of the aforementioned equations and variables 2 3 2 1 4 predicted biomass due to stress on plant the swat model considers 4 types of stress to estimate plant growth factors water temperature nitrogen and phosphorus stresses for greenhouse management it is assumed that there are no water or nutrient stresses 2 4 water productivity for this research work the terms physical productivity of water pwp and water productivity wp are applied as follows 8 p h y s i c a l w a t e r p r o d u c t i v i t y p r o d u c t i o n k g w a t e r w i t h d r a w a l m 3 9 w a t e r p r o d u c t i v i t y p r o d u c t i o n k g e v a p o t r a n s p i r a t i o n m 3 these terms help to evaluate the performance of the water saving measures in a more realistic manner if a measure allows the same or higher production while water deliveries are reduced then there is an apparent increase in pwp if the water delivered remains constant and the area of irrigation increases then again there is an apparent increase in pwp but for the objective of water saving one must measure production per unit of water consumed mainly evapotranspiration which is based on depletion not withdrawal eq 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 models calibration and validation 3 1 1 swat model the model results for the discharge gauging stations fig 1 are shown in table 4 also the annual average of simulated potential et mm and yield ton ha for wheat and tomato are illustrated in table 5 3 1 2 aquacrop model after preparation calibration of plant parameters was done using the local practices studies showed that the sensitivity of model is higher than some other parameters the calibrated values of these parameters for wheat are presented in table 6 3 2 evaluation of water saving measures the water saving measures were evaluated using the developed modeling framework and the selected criteria the evaluations were first done separately and then they were compared it is also assumed that possible rebound effects e g increasing cropped area or changing cropping patterns scott et al 2014 are fully controlled while applying the water saving measures 3 2 1 deficit irrigation df 3 2 1 1 real water saving as has been already pointed out df management options include 0 full irrigation 20 40 and 50 reductions in irrigation for wheat cultivation fig 3 shows the results and how eta has been reduced in comparison to the full irrigation 1000 mm of surface irrigation which is actually water withdrawal value the results of modellings showed that actual evapotranspiration depletion under the df managements are 581 561 and 528 mm respectively so the highest capacity of this measure for rws percentage of reduction of actual evapotranspiration is at the 50 df scenario and is only 12 3 2 1 2 return flow furthermore the most important difference between full irrigation and deficit irrigation is in return flow in the field scale evaluation this value ranges from 472 mm at a 0 df to 15 mm under the 50 df scenario fig 4 a but at the basin scale evaluation the values of return flow are 166 mm and 141 mm respectively fig 4b which emphasizes the role of scale in evaluations 3 2 1 3 yield and water productivity by implementing deficit irrigation the yield decreases from 3 7 ton ha at full irrigation to 3 4 3 2 and 2 8 ton ha under the 20 40 and 50 df scenarios using the previous results makes it possible to estimate the physical pwp withdrawal base and non physical water productivity wp eta base indices fig 5 notably while pwp increases from 0 37 to 0 56 kg m3 the wp decreases from 0 61 full irrigation to 0 53 kg m3 scenario df 50 3 2 1 4 soil salinity one of the main side effects of deficit irrigation is increased salt accumulation in soil which is the result of reductions in return flows table 7 shows changes in salt balance in the soil profile the average annual salt accumulation increases from 7 1 ton ha in the current condition 0 df to 7 5 9 5 and 9 9 ton ha under 20 40 and 50 df respectively 3 2 2 drip irrigation dp 3 2 2 1 real water saving the effects of changing conventional surface irrigation 42 ie and 1000 mm ha irrigation to drip irrigation 80 ie and 745 mm ha irrigation were evaluated in terms of rws fig 6 it is notable that the drip system did not decrease consumption but actually increased consumption up to 8 3 significantly while this type of irrigation system is considered to be a water saving measure applying drip irrigation has simultaneously increased irrigation efficiency from 40 to 80 and actual evapotranspiration from 598 to 645 mm fig 7 also reveals the variation of soil evaporation and transpiration due to changing the irrigation system dp increase in transpiration from 444 to 518 mm and reduction in evaporation from 154 to 137 mm it should be noted that the eta in the figure includes effective rainfall this is why the amount of eta in cases of drip irrigation exceeds irrigation depth 3 2 2 2 return flow changing the irrigation systems from surface to dp affects the status of return flows fig 8 as shown in the figure the role of scale is noticeable fig 8a shows a substantial difference between return flows at the field scale it is reduced from 472 mm to almost 0 by using drip irrigation however at the basin scale fig 8b the differences are not significant and it is only about a 6 reduction this issue is also reported by ward and pulido velazquez 2008 who mentioned that high efficiencies reduce return flows 3 2 2 3 yield and water productivity wp the drip irrigation system increases wheat yield by 17 fig 9 from the wp perspective applying this system increases pwp from 0 37 to 0 61 kg m3 while the wp remains almost the same only increasing from 0 62 kg m3 to 0 69 kg m3 it is notable that the ratio of pwp due to the application of these systems is about 2 2 however this ratio for wp is only 1 11 the same ratios are also reported by ward and pulido velazquez 2008 3 2 2 4 soil salinity change in the salt balance can be a dangerous consequence of high irrigation efficiencies it can be seen from table 8 that 80 ie has resulted in more salt accumulation in the soil profile 7 1 ton ha increase to 15 7 ton ha it is obvious that reduction in return flow is the main factor for this situation 3 2 3 greenhouse cultivation gh 3 2 3 1 real water saving as has already been pointed out the evaluation of gh measures is done based on cultivation of tomato the significant rws changes resulting from this measure are illustrated in fig 10 it can be seen that eta decreases from 772 to 584 mm 188 mm or 24 reduction salokhe et al 2005 reported a 25 reduction in eta tomato cultivation in gh koupai et al 2010 also reported that eta in cultivation of tomato is reduced from 689 mm in the fields to 524 mm by greenhouse cultivation 24 reduction they used direct measurements for this assessment 3 2 3 2 return flow as has already been explained the permeability of gh is assumed by swat to be zero therefore by applying greenhouse management return flow at field scale increases from 176 to 315 mm the total rainfall is about 360 mm which is due to higher runoff however the change is not very significant at the basin scale fig 11 the excess return flows due to gh can be attributed to more groundwater recharge delavar and morid 2016 3 2 3 3 yield and water productivity fig 12 shows high significance of gh on the tomato yield compared with field cultivation production increased from 33 5 to 102 ton ha wp also increased from 4 3 kg m3 to 17 4 kg m3 in gh for instance sánchez et al 2015 found vegetables grown under greenhouses to have higher water productivity than those grown outdoors tomatoes showed wp values ranging between 18 7 and 21 8 kg m3 3 3 summary of effects and side effects of water saving measures a summary of the results of applying water saving measures is presented in table 9 as shown in the table sustainable measures must in addition to saving water also consider soil sustainability 4 summary and conclusions whether water saving has positive effects largely depends on the distinction between depletion and withdrawal for wheat cultivation in our study area while measures like deficit irrigation or improving drip irrigation have capacities to reduce water withdrawal by about 40 and 50 respectively their effects on depletion reduction rws were less than 12 or even had a negative impact eta increase however greenhouses showed a capacity for 24 reduction in water depletion the aforementioned point about depletion and withdrawal is also very crucial to evaluate the effect of water saving on water productivity for physical water productivity pwp which is mainly withdrawal base implementing deficit irrigation increases wheat pwp from 0 37 kg m3 full irrigation to 0 56 kg m3 50 df however for wp which is depletion base the opposite is true and it decreases from 0 61 kg m3 to 0 53 kg m3 with the irrigation deficit a similar result is observed for drip irrigation greenhouse cultivation however had a positive effect and caused an increase in wp of tomato from 4 3 kg m3 to 17 4 kg m3 another important issue is the scale which is very important to return flow at the field scale the water saving measures can have significant effect on this factor for instance the deficit irrigation reduced return flows up to 95 and drip irrigation almost eliminated it however at the basin scale there is insignificant change in return flows assuming no enhancement in the cultivated area or changes in cropping pattern what is called the rebound effect so while to some extent the environmental flows can be saved in reality there are many reports about rebound effect as the negative effect of water saving measures which can threaten the environmental flows as well another danger of the illusion of reducing water consumption by only looking to reduction of withdrawal is soil salt accumulation the results showed increases of salt accumulation for deficit and drip irrigation of up to 100 for the study area as the side effect of some of the water saving measures the study showed that evaluation of water saving measures is not something that can be done solely within a field or by comparing the records of water meters before and after the implementation of measures an integrated framework and basin wide perspective that tracks crop yield water depletion salt accumulation and environmental flows is necessary such a framework was developed in this study by means of a modified swat model and aquacrop and it can be applied for similar studies acknowledgments this research was a part of national project entitled development of national strategy for adaptation to climate change in iran water

reduced evapotranspiration and potato yield but water can be saved in terms of yield per unit of water used in irrigation greenhouses are also a possibility for water saving the use of greenhouses decreases crop water requirements by reducing evapotranspiration because the plastic cover changes the radiation balance by entrapping long wave radiation and also creates a barrier to moisture loss tipis and mpusia 2006 it reduces the non beneficial component of evapotranspiration evaporation from soil fernandes et al 2003 reported that evapotranspiration inside a greenhouse is around 60 to 80 of outside evapotranspiration to simulate the aforementioned measures the most popular model is aquacrop steduto et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 the model is field scale and is used to simulate crop growth jin et al 2014 different agricultural water management scenarios greaves and wang 2016 pawar et al 2017 nyathi et al 2018 ket et al 2018 drainage management zabihi et al 2015 and soil salinity el mokh et al 2017 for basin scale modeling the soil and water assessment tool swat is a well known model arnold et al 1993 it is also considered for rws analyses for instance lei et al 2015 used it to assess a number of management scenarios for rws in the north plain of china the assessed scenarios included deficit irrigation crop pattern change and irrigation water source change however swat doesn t have a soil salinity component and none of the models simulate greenhouse conditions this paper attempts to evaluate a number of popular water saving measures in an integrated framework in which effects and side effects of measures are considered in evaluations the modeling setup links swat and aquacrop so that different field and basin scale criteria e g return flows rws crop productivity soil salt budget are simultaneously simulated due to the swat code being open source deficits of simulation like greenhouse can be added to the model to show the methodology for doing so tashk bakhtegan basin and its most important plain marvdasht kharame iran are used as the study area 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data marvdasht kharame is the most important intermediate subbasin of tashk bakhtegan basin with a total area of 3942 km2 the subbasin is located between longitudes 45 47 and 47 20 north and between latitudes 35 41 and 37 27 east fig 1 the average annual rainfall in the basin is 360 mm and its irrigated cultivation area is 107595 ha this subbasin ends at the tashk bakhtegan lakes fig 1 the water requirements of these two lakes are mainly met by the return flows of agricultural lands weather input data were obtained from the iranian meteorological organization imo for six stations that are located in the basin also streamflow data required for calibration and validation of the model were obtained from the ministry of energy of iran table 1 and fig 1 show the specifications and locations of the gauging stations used in the study 1990 2008 the growing season in the subbasin is from mid spring to mid autumn and water requirements are mainly met from groundwater resources the region s irrigation efficiency varies from 40 for surface systems to 80 for drip systems major crops are wheat barley alfalfa potato tomato sugar beet and onion the agricultural information including cropping pattern planting and harvesting dates irrigation management cultivated area of major crops and fertilizer uses are provided from the fars jahade agriculture organization fjao the field scale part of this paper focuses more on wheat and tomato and the related information is shown in table 2 palnt parameters of wheat phonological stages also is presented in table 3 2 2 water saving measures among the various water saving measures deficit irrigation df drip irrigation dp and development of greenhouse gh cultivation are investigated and compared with surface irrigation si as the base scenario the region s gross water requirements and efficiencies of surface and drip irrigation systems are 1000 mm and 745 mm and 42 and 80 respectively also irrigation duration was set as 10 days and 2 days for surface and drip irrigation systems respectively based on local practices furthermore for implementation of deficit irrigation different scenarios including deficits of 20 40 and 50 with respect to the conventional irrigation depth i e 1000 mm ha are used same ratios are also applied by lei et al 2015 2 3 modeling setup and descriptions df and dp are applied for wheat cultivation and gh is applied for tomato cultivation also the selected criteria for evaluation of the measures include real water saving reduction of actual evaporation c1 return flows at field and basin scale outlet of the subbasin c2 crop yield c3 water productivity c4 and soil salinity accumulation c5 c1 c3 and c4 are considered as effects and the rest are side effects to simulate the measures and estimate the criteria both aquacrop and swat models are applied for more clarification to evaluate df and dp measures aquacrop is applied to estimate c1 c2 at the field scale c3 c4 and c5 however swat is needed to estimate c2 at the basin scale for this the model was separately run applying df and dp in the management of all hrus under wheat cultivation for gh none of the models has this management so this option was added to swat see next section then all the hrus with field cultivation of tomato were converted to greenhouse and the c1 to c4 criteria were evaluated salinity or c4 is neglected for gh fig 2 illustrates the aforementioned tools measures criteria and their interrelationships to address the objectives of this research work 2 3 1 aquacrop aquacrop is a software system developed by the land and water division of fao 2009 in order to increase water efficiency practices in agricultural production trombetta et al 2016 the model calculates the daily soil water balance and describes the interactions between plants and the soil the soil water balance is the sum of the ingoing fluxes rainfall irrigation and capillary rise and outgoing fluxes evaporation and transpiration runoff and deep percolation lievens 2014 the root zone is mathematically described as a reservoir the change of the water content in the soil profile is obtained by the soil water balance equation 1 w r t 1 w r t p r o i c r e t r d p where w r t and w r t 1 are the water contents in the root zone at times t and t 1 deep percolation losses dp will occur if after significant rainfall or excessive irrigation w r exceeds field capacity as shown in eq 1 the model calculates separately evaporation and transpiration components allen et al 1998 furthermore the effect of water stress on crop growth are segregated into four components canopy growth canopy senescence tr and harvest index hi akumaga et al 2017 one of the most important parameters used in aquacrop is the normalized water productivity wp which tends to be constant regardless of climatic conditions steduto et al 2009 using this parameter and the ratio of the cumulative amount of water transpired t r to reference evapotranspiration eto the biomass production b is estimated as follows 2 b w p t r i e t o i final crop yield y is simulated by multiplying b by a harvest index hi which expresses the mass of the harvested product as a percentage of the total above ground biomass b 3 y h i b to estimate the reduction of crop yield due salinity it uses the average seasonal saturated soil paste extract ece in the root zone as an indicator and then uses following equation el mokh et al 2017 4 b 100 1 kssalt where kssalt is the salinity stress coefficient determined by the average electrical conductivity of ece 2 3 2 swat the soil and water assessment tool swat has been developed by the usda agricultural research service liu et al 2016 swat is a physical semi distributed hydrological model that can operate under different climate conditions and land use change scenarios ruan et al 2017 this model is a process based continuous hydrological model ahmadzadeh et al 2016 the swat model was developed to predict the impact of land management practices on water sediment and agricultural chemical yield in large complex watersheds with varying soils land use and management conditions over long periods of time arnold et al 2012 for this research work a modified version of swat was developed for tashk bakhtegan basin called swat fars delavar et al 2017 this version is enhanced with the wa water accounting karimi et al 2013 so the depletion of water is considered to be very crucial for rws more details about swat fars are available in delavar and morid 2016 2 3 2 1 embedding greenhouse management greenhouse management is not originally defined in swat nor in swat fars so it was necessary to add it to the model the most important modifications in this regard are 1 estimation of evapotranspiration et in greenhouse situation and 2 hydrological factors like runoff and infiltration with respect to greenhouse situations 2 3 2 1 1 evapotranspiration in greenhouse accurate estimation of et is a key parameter in the crop management of greenhouses with this aim the stanghellini model 1987 was applied this model is the revised version of the penman montieth equation based on the status of air velocities in greenhouses usually low and less than 1 m s 1 5 e t 2 l a i 1 λ s r n g k t v p d ρ c p r r s γ 1 r c r a 6 r n 0 07 r n s 252 ρ c p t t 0 r r r n s 0 77 r s 7 r r ρ c p 4 σ t 273 15 3 where e t is reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 r n is net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 k t is unit conversion factor equal to 3600 s h 1 vpd is daily or hourly vapor pressure deficit kpa ρ is mean atmospheric density kg m 3 c p is specific heat of the air mj kg 1 1 r r is radiative resistance s m 1 r c is canopy resistance s m 1 r a is aerodynamic resistance s m 1 λ is latent heat of vaporization mj kg 1 s is slope of the saturation vapour pressure curve kpa 1 γ is psychrometric constant kpa 1 and lai is leaf area index m2 m 2 potential evapotranspiration corrections were applied in the etpot f subroutine to do this it was necessary to correct or add to the equations some other parameters including net radiation at the crop surface r n net short wave radiation r n s leaf temperature to and radiative resistance r r this equation is verified by comparing the actual evapotranspiration of the greenhouse with that of fields as mentioned before evapotranspiration in greenhouse cultivation is 60 85 of that for open cultivation as will be shown this rate is about 76 in our study area this method was included in the etpot f subroutine as a new method in addition to penman montieth hargreaves and priestly taylor methods 2 3 2 1 2 runoff and infiltration considering the impenetrability of greenhouses and the resulting impact on hru runoff and percolation rate the following changes were made 1 the soil layer in the subroutine of perc f was considered zero 2 the curve number for hrus with greenhouse management was set as 100 file mgt 2 3 2 1 3 radiation and vapor pressure deficit other parameters that are considered include radiation and vapor pressure deficit vpd by entrapping long wave radiation greenhouses change the energy balance including net radiation from the sun transfer of heat and vapor from a canopy and crop evapotranspiration fazlil ilahil 2009 furthermore greenhouses reduce evapotranspiration by blocking wind increasing relative humidity and decreasing the solar radiation that reaches the plants o connor and mehta 2016 for the required simulations radiation and vpd corrections are applied in the grow f subroutine of the swat model this subroutine applies beer s law to calculate intercepted photosynthetically active radiation on a given day h p h o s y n the cover of greenhouse potentially changes the physical properties of the surface area and its albedo therefore it potentially affects the ratio of intercepted radiation of greenhouse comparing with open field fan et al 2015 showed this ratio is about 0 1 in plastic film greenhouses so h p h o s y n is adjusted based on the field α 0 3 and greenhouse α 0 7 albedo in our study shamshiri 2007 romullus 2014 furthermore the subroutine includes two equations to calculate a plant s radiation use efficiency rue one is used when vpd 1 and the other when vpd 1 in greenhouses vpd is smaller than 1 li 2015 so the second equation is applied it is recommended to review stockle and kiniry 1990 for more details about of the aforementioned equations and variables 2 3 2 1 4 predicted biomass due to stress on plant the swat model considers 4 types of stress to estimate plant growth factors water temperature nitrogen and phosphorus stresses for greenhouse management it is assumed that there are no water or nutrient stresses 2 4 water productivity for this research work the terms physical productivity of water pwp and water productivity wp are applied as follows 8 p h y s i c a l w a t e r p r o d u c t i v i t y p r o d u c t i o n k g w a t e r w i t h d r a w a l m 3 9 w a t e r p r o d u c t i v i t y p r o d u c t i o n k g e v a p o t r a n s p i r a t i o n m 3 these terms help to evaluate the performance of the water saving measures in a more realistic manner if a measure allows the same or higher production while water deliveries are reduced then there is an apparent increase in pwp if the water delivered remains constant and the area of irrigation increases then again there is an apparent increase in pwp but for the objective of water saving one must measure production per unit of water consumed mainly evapotranspiration which is based on depletion not withdrawal eq 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 models calibration and validation 3 1 1 swat model the model results for the discharge gauging stations fig 1 are shown in table 4 also the annual average of simulated potential et mm and yield ton ha for wheat and tomato are illustrated in table 5 3 1 2 aquacrop model after preparation calibration of plant parameters was done using the local practices studies showed that the sensitivity of model is higher than some other parameters the calibrated values of these parameters for wheat are presented in table 6 3 2 evaluation of water saving measures the water saving measures were evaluated using the developed modeling framework and the selected criteria the evaluations were first done separately and then they were compared it is also assumed that possible rebound effects e g increasing cropped area or changing cropping patterns scott et al 2014 are fully controlled while applying the water saving measures 3 2 1 deficit irrigation df 3 2 1 1 real water saving as has been already pointed out df management options include 0 full irrigation 20 40 and 50 reductions in irrigation for wheat cultivation fig 3 shows the results and how eta has been reduced in comparison to the full irrigation 1000 mm of surface irrigation which is actually water withdrawal value the results of modellings showed that actual evapotranspiration depletion under the df managements are 581 561 and 528 mm respectively so the highest capacity of this measure for rws percentage of reduction of actual evapotranspiration is at the 50 df scenario and is only 12 3 2 1 2 return flow furthermore the most important difference between full irrigation and deficit irrigation is in return flow in the field scale evaluation this value ranges from 472 mm at a 0 df to 15 mm under the 50 df scenario fig 4 a but at the basin scale evaluation the values of return flow are 166 mm and 141 mm respectively fig 4b which emphasizes the role of scale in evaluations 3 2 1 3 yield and water productivity by implementing deficit irrigation the yield decreases from 3 7 ton ha at full irrigation to 3 4 3 2 and 2 8 ton ha under the 20 40 and 50 df scenarios using the previous results makes it possible to estimate the physical pwp withdrawal base and non physical water productivity wp eta base indices fig 5 notably while pwp increases from 0 37 to 0 56 kg m3 the wp decreases from 0 61 full irrigation to 0 53 kg m3 scenario df 50 3 2 1 4 soil salinity one of the main side effects of deficit irrigation is increased salt accumulation in soil which is the result of reductions in return flows table 7 shows changes in salt balance in the soil profile the average annual salt accumulation increases from 7 1 ton ha in the current condition 0 df to 7 5 9 5 and 9 9 ton ha under 20 40 and 50 df respectively 3 2 2 drip irrigation dp 3 2 2 1 real water saving the effects of changing conventional surface irrigation 42 ie and 1000 mm ha irrigation to drip irrigation 80 ie and 745 mm ha irrigation were evaluated in terms of rws fig 6 it is notable that the drip system did not decrease consumption but actually increased consumption up to 8 3 significantly while this type of irrigation system is considered to be a water saving measure applying drip irrigation has simultaneously increased irrigation efficiency from 40 to 80 and actual evapotranspiration from 598 to 645 mm fig 7 also reveals the variation of soil evaporation and transpiration due to changing the irrigation system dp increase in transpiration from 444 to 518 mm and reduction in evaporation from 154 to 137 mm it should be noted that the eta in the figure includes effective rainfall this is why the amount of eta in cases of drip irrigation exceeds irrigation depth 3 2 2 2 return flow changing the irrigation systems from surface to dp affects the status of return flows fig 8 as shown in the figure the role of scale is noticeable fig 8a shows a substantial difference between return flows at the field scale it is reduced from 472 mm to almost 0 by using drip irrigation however at the basin scale fig 8b the differences are not significant and it is only about a 6 reduction this issue is also reported by ward and pulido velazquez 2008 who mentioned that high efficiencies reduce return flows 3 2 2 3 yield and water productivity wp the drip irrigation system increases wheat yield by 17 fig 9 from the wp perspective applying this system increases pwp from 0 37 to 0 61 kg m3 while the wp remains almost the same only increasing from 0 62 kg m3 to 0 69 kg m3 it is notable that the ratio of pwp due to the application of these systems is about 2 2 however this ratio for wp is only 1 11 the same ratios are also reported by ward and pulido velazquez 2008 3 2 2 4 soil salinity change in the salt balance can be a dangerous consequence of high irrigation efficiencies it can be seen from table 8 that 80 ie has resulted in more salt accumulation in the soil profile 7 1 ton ha increase to 15 7 ton ha it is obvious that reduction in return flow is the main factor for this situation 3 2 3 greenhouse cultivation gh 3 2 3 1 real water saving as has already been pointed out the evaluation of gh measures is done based on cultivation of tomato the significant rws changes resulting from this measure are illustrated in fig 10 it can be seen that eta decreases from 772 to 584 mm 188 mm or 24 reduction salokhe et al 2005 reported a 25 reduction in eta tomato cultivation in gh koupai et al 2010 also reported that eta in cultivation of tomato is reduced from 689 mm in the fields to 524 mm by greenhouse cultivation 24 reduction they used direct measurements for this assessment 3 2 3 2 return flow as has already been explained the permeability of gh is assumed by swat to be zero therefore by applying greenhouse management return flow at field scale increases from 176 to 315 mm the total rainfall is about 360 mm which is due to higher runoff however the change is not very significant at the basin scale fig 11 the excess return flows due to gh can be attributed to more groundwater recharge delavar and morid 2016 3 2 3 3 yield and water productivity fig 12 shows high significance of gh on the tomato yield compared with field cultivation production increased from 33 5 to 102 ton ha wp also increased from 4 3 kg m3 to 17 4 kg m3 in gh for instance sánchez et al 2015 found vegetables grown under greenhouses to have higher water productivity than those grown outdoors tomatoes showed wp values ranging between 18 7 and 21 8 kg m3 3 3 summary of effects and side effects of water saving measures a summary of the results of applying water saving measures is presented in table 9 as shown in the table sustainable measures must in addition to saving water also consider soil sustainability 4 summary and conclusions whether water saving has positive effects largely depends on the distinction between depletion and withdrawal for wheat cultivation in our study area while measures like deficit irrigation or improving drip irrigation have capacities to reduce water withdrawal by about 40 and 50 respectively their effects on depletion reduction rws were less than 12 or even had a negative impact eta increase however greenhouses showed a capacity for 24 reduction in water depletion the aforementioned point about depletion and withdrawal is also very crucial to evaluate the effect of water saving on water productivity for physical water productivity pwp which is mainly withdrawal base implementing deficit irrigation increases wheat pwp from 0 37 kg m3 full irrigation to 0 56 kg m3 50 df however for wp which is depletion base the opposite is true and it decreases from 0 61 kg m3 to 0 53 kg m3 with the irrigation deficit a similar result is observed for drip irrigation greenhouse cultivation however had a positive effect and caused an increase in wp of tomato from 4 3 kg m3 to 17 4 kg m3 another important issue is the scale which is very important to return flow at the field scale the water saving measures can have significant effect on this factor for instance the deficit irrigation reduced return flows up to 95 and drip irrigation almost eliminated it however at the basin scale there is insignificant change in return flows assuming no enhancement in the cultivated area or changes in cropping pattern what is called the rebound effect so while to some extent the environmental flows can be saved in reality there are many reports about rebound effect as the negative effect of water saving measures which can threaten the environmental flows as well another danger of the illusion of reducing water consumption by only looking to reduction of withdrawal is soil salt accumulation the results showed increases of salt accumulation for deficit and drip irrigation of up to 100 for the study area as the side effect of some of the water saving measures the study showed that evaluation of water saving measures is not something that can be done solely within a field or by comparing the records of water meters before and after the implementation of measures an integrated framework and basin wide perspective that tracks crop yield water depletion salt accumulation and environmental flows is necessary such a framework was developed in this study by means of a modified swat model and aquacrop and it can be applied for similar studies acknowledgments this research was a part of national project entitled development of national strategy for adaptation to climate change in iran water

10926,under semi arid conditions water is the most limiting factor for ensuring the sustainability of mediterranean agriculture proper management of practices such as irrigation fertilization and changes in sowing date and sowing density can contribute decisively to efficient water management in these agricultural systems thus the aim of this study was to assess the effect in terms of yield and profit of combining those agricultural practices and subsequently to define strategies for the sustainable intensification of semi arid agricultural systems in southern spain the study focused on sunflower as a representative crop sustainable intensification practices were evaluated through a series of experiments revealing the prominent role played by water availability in their performance thus high sowing density provided much more satisfactory yield results compared to the traditional sowing density and it was observed that this yield increase was related to water availability higher yield increases around 27 were obtained with deficit irrigation strategies than under severe deficit irrigation or rainfed conditions around 16 other intensification strategies such as support irrigation and early sowing date also generated satisfactory yield increases around 45 and 30 respectively finally interactions between irrigation and fertilization indicated that under limited water availability very low n fertilization rates were required all these results led to the conclusion that the combination of high sowing densities early sowing date deficit irrigation and limited fertilization constitutes an innovative intensification strategy for sunflower under semi arid conditions an economic analysis of the proposed agricultural practices also revealed a clear connection between water availability and optimized management of sowing density sowing date and fertilization these results confirmed that technical advisory services provided to farmers should focus on integrated site specific crop management especially under semi arid conditions with severely limited water availability keywords water availability sustainable intensification deficit irrigation strategies sowing density sowing date semi arid conditions 1 introduction rainfed agriculture plays a significant role in the agricultural systems of southern europe this type of agriculture is mainly based on specific low input cultivation techniques for wheat sunflower and legume crops that allow efficient and effective use of limited soil moisture agriculture is one of the sectors most vulnerable to the impact of global climate change tingem et al 2009 and rainfed systems are especially vulnerable to changes in weather conditions valverde et al 2015 the general circulation models gmcs of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc have predicted strong warming over western and southern europe during summer with increases in mean summer temperatures exceeding 6 c by the end of the century and substantial decreases in summer precipitation in southern and central europe ipcc 2014 furthermore heat waves and droughts are predicted to occur more often due to the combined effect of warmer temperatures and less precipitation lotze campen 2011 spain has a total of 17 m ha of farmland of which only 3 5 m ha are cultivated under irrigation while the rest are rainfed crops in these rainfed systems sunflower is a relevant crop globally the european union is the third largest sunflower producer in the world behind ukraine and russia mapama 2016 spain ranks fourth or fifth in terms of eu countries sunflower yield depending on climatological factors mainly drought by cultivated area it lies in third place behind romania and bulgaria in 2016 in spain around 730 000 ha was dedicated to sunflower cultivation and in andalusia the region with the largest cultivated area this crop was cultivated on around 260 000 ha of which only 5 was cultivated under irrigation mapama 2016 consequently the sunflower crop in its traditional production areas such as the guadalquivir valley in andalusia will be exposed to severe impacts of climate change related to water shortages and high temperatures debaeke et al 2017 especially when these climatic conditions happen during the critical periods of the crop cycle from early flowering to the achene filling stage garcía lópez et al 2014 in addition to these impacts the scarcity of available adaptation strategies for rainfed agriculture could be a limiting factor for the future economic sustainability of agricultural systems cultivated with sunflower throughout history farmers have responded to changes in the environment by adopting new crop cultivars and by adjusting their cultural practices gala bijl and fisher 2011 at the farm level examples of these adaptations include alterations in planting and harvest dates changes in cropping sequence better water management in irrigation systems optimized use of fertilizers and adoption of improved tillage practices adams et al 1998 in addition to the concerns related to climate change the productivity of rainfed sunﬂower under mediterranean conditions is currently low figueiredo et al 2017 and is strongly dependent on water availability and the water use efﬁciency of the crop barros et al 2004 soriano et al 2004 water is by far the most limiting factor for rainfed sunﬂower production although other factors such as temperature during flowering stage garcía lópez et al 2014 fertilization garcía lópez et al 2016 sowing date and sowing density may show an influential interaction with water supply diepenbrock et al 2001 barros et al 2004 thus the abovementioned limiting factors relating to future climate change will require combining production intensification strategies with strategies aimed at improving the efficiency of the systems these practices have recently been integrated under the term sustainable intensification gadanakis et al 2015 kumar et al 2018 the implementation of efficient deficit irrigation practices is one of the main sustainable intensification actions proposed for sunflower systems in southern spain garcía lópez et al 2016 although the irrigation of low income crops such as sunflower is not yet common lorite et al 2012 equally proper management of sowing density is one of the most widely recommended agricultural practices to achieve an increase in crop productivity escalante estrada et al 2008 jia et al 2018 thus an appropriate number of individual plants per unit area may enable a better use of water and nutritional resources increasing density reduces biomass and yield per plant but biomass production and seed yield per unit area are higher vega muñoz et al 2001 the optimum sowing density for sunﬂower is inﬂuenced by several factors such as temperature soil fertility water availability and genotype villalobos et al 1994 diepenbrock et al 2001 in recent years the need to increase yields and thereby to improve crop productivity and profitability has encouraged an increase in sowing density this practice has been promoted in response to the negative trend in sunflower yields in andalusia since the late 80 s garcía ruiz et al 2008 this decline may have been caused by the sudden appearance of sunflower broomrape orobanche cumana wallr in traditional areas of cultivation which led to the substitution of older varieties that were highly productive but also very susceptible to the parasite garcía ruiz et al 2008 therefore seed companies primary objective has been to quickly breed broomrape resistant varieties leaving yield and oil content as a lower priority another agricultural practice in semi arid mediterranean environments is the implementation of early sowing dates nouri et al 2017 allowing the crop to beneﬁt from moderate temperatures at the end of the crop cycle garcía lópez et al 2014 and from late winter rainfall reducing the volume of water required to sustain the yield sarno et al 1992 soriano et al 2004 garcía lópez et al 2016 conversely the delay in sowing date shortens the growing cycle decreasing the amount of radiation intercepted during the growing season and thus the total dry matter at harvest andrade 1995 sunderman et al 1997 therefore to maximize the use of natural resources the selection of an appropriate sowing date is a critical issue since it ensures good seed germination as well as the timely appearance of seedlings and the optimum development of the root system equally a suitable sowing date allows the critical periods for oil yield and its components to overlap with the part of the growing season when the most environmental resources are available balalic et al 2012 the practice of winter sowing for sunflower in andalusia was first developed in the 1980s studies carried out during that period in the region such as gimeno et al 1989 showed clear increases in yield of up to 30 over the usual yield for the area however this shift in the sowing date was not put into practice by the farmers because of the difficulty in carrying out proper weed control weed interference increases the risk of crop yield losses despite the technological progress made in weed control korres et al 2016 an advance in the sowing date resulted in a greater abundance of winter weeds which in the conventional spring sowings are easily controlled by land tilling prior to planting under these circumstances the sowing density is key to effective inter row tillage the distance between the sowing lines must be at least 65 cm which entails densities from around 60 000 plants ha this is a critical requisite as in the past it was not feasible to integrate an early sowing date with high sowing density with the appearance in recent years of herbicide resistant cultivars clearfield and expresssun technology a clear opportunity to solve those limitations has been identified but new research studies are needed to be able to take advantage of these opportunities finally correct fertilization coordinated with the irrigation supply constitutes an essential factor for optimal crop management debaeke et al 2006 sinha et al 2017 and represents a useful sustainable intensification technique especially in systems affected by severe water stress garcía lópez et al 2016 despite their low profitability extensive crops play an important role in the agriculture systems of southern europe however while previous studies have described a significant number of agronomic practices for increasing the crop sustainability of extensive crops such as maize welde and gebremariam 2016 or wheat abolpour 2018 few studies have done so for sunflower given the new challenges described above and in order to fill the gap in the literature specifically regarding sunflower the main objective of this study was to evaluate different sustainable intensification strategies for mediterranean agricultural systems cultivated with sunflower the strategies analyzed were increases in sowing density changes in the sowing dates and limited irrigation and fertilizer supply furthermore the interaction between these strategies was also assessed in order to determine whether these new crop management approaches have a positive influence on the economic sustainability of these agricultural systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiments with sustainable intensification practices four sustainable intensification practices related to sowing date and density irrigation and fertilization management fig 1 and their interactions with water availability were evaluated through a study conducted during six growing seasons from 2012 to 2017 in three experimental fields located at ifapa alameda del obispo córdoba ifapa tomejil carmona and ifapa rancho de la merced jerez de la frontera in andalusia southern spain fig 2 the climate in córdoba and carmona both located in the guadalquivir valley is considered semi arid with the rainy period concentrated between autumn and spring and with a very hot dry summer season different weather conditions are found in jerez which is located closer to the coast with a different rainfall pattern lower maximum temperatures and higher relative humidity at the ifapa alameda del obispo experimental farm located near the city of córdoba latitude 37º 51 42 n longitude 04º 48 0 w two trials were carried out during the 2012 and 2013 seasons aimed at evaluating the interaction between fertilization and irrigation supply in addition during the 2016 and 2017 seasons two trials were run to evaluate the interaction between sowing density and irrigation supply table 1 the 2012 and 2013 trials are fully described in garcía lópez et al 2016 the 2016 and 2017 trials were arranged as strip plot designs with four replications where irrigation rates were the main plots and sowing density were the sub plots experimental plots consisted of 4 rows with a north south orientation 10 m long 70 cm apart and two distances between plants within rows 20 and 15 cm resulting in plant populations of around 70 000 d2 and 95 000 d1 plants ha respectively both trials were seeded with lg 5537 ho cultivar limagrain for the irrigation treatments a drip irrigation system with 75 cm drip emitter spacing was used two strategies were considered in these treatments providing around 15 and 40 of the full irrigation requirements of the crop for r1 and r2 strategy respectively thus for each year and trial different irrigation scheduling was used providing 82 246 123 and 232 5 mm for the trials co 2016 r1 co 2016 r2 co 2017 r1 and co 2017 r2 respectively representing 12 8 38 5 19 9 and 37 7 of the full water requirements full irrigation scheduling was based on a water balance approach described later in section 2 2 the other six trials were carried out under rainfed conditions one located in ifapa rancho de la merced experimental farm situated near the city of jerez de la frontera cádiz latitude 36 38 33 n longitude 06 00 48 w in 2015 and five located in ifapa tomejil experimental farm situated near the city of carmona seville latitude 37 24 07 n longitude 05 35 10 w in 2014 2015 and 2017 table 1 all of them were arranged as strip plot designs with four replications where the main factor was sowing density and the secondary factor was varieties in addition in 2015 and 2017 in the trials carried out in ifapa tomejil two different sowing dates were used per year conventional sowing dates s2 and winter sowing dates s1 table 2 experimental plots consisted of 4 rows 70 cm apart or 6 rows 40 cm apart 10 m long and 25 cm between plants within rows obtaining approximate densities of 60 000 d2 and 100 000 d1 plants per hectare respectively for the trial conducted in 2014 and the three trials carried out in 2015 three cultivars were used one hybrid resistant to race f of sunflower broomrape orobanche cumana wallr one hybrid resistant to pulsar40 herbicide based on clearfield technology and one hybrid resistant to granstar50 herbicide based on expresssuntm technology the clearfield technology consists of hybrids with resistance to herbicides of the imidazolinone family and the expresssuntm technology involves hybrids that are tolerant to a herbicide of the sulfonylureas family lastly for the two trials of 2017 only two varieties were used the hybrid resistant to the race f sunflower broomrape and the hybrid with clearfield technology in each trial and replication phenology stages were identified table 2 by periodical visits to experimental fields in addition seed yield and seed oil content were assessed by harvesting all the plants from the two central rows of the trials to avoid crop border effects seed oil content was estimated using nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy 2 2 crop water requirements irrigation scheduling and fertilization irrigation scheduling and crop water stress assessment for each irrigated trial were computed using a water balance approach based on allen et al 1998 and previously described in garcía lópez et al 2016 thus using a cascade approach a daily water balance was computed for each field including rainfall and irrigation as inputs and superficial runoff deep percolation soil evaporation and crop transpiration as outputs lorite et al 2004 a key component of crop water stress and irrigation scheduling is the accurate assessment of crop water requirements using crop coefficients allen et al 1998 in this study the methodology for assessing crop basal coefficients kcb entailed assessing crop ground cover by means of overhead digital pictures using the greencrop tracker software pattey and liu 2010 these pictures were taken with variable temporal frequency depending on the crop stage table 2 daily kcb values were calculated based on the available images and using an interpolation technique based on a spline function santos et al 2008 trezza et al 2013 these daily values and the reference evapotranspiration eto provide the crop transpiration the key component for assessing crop water requirements weather data and eto were collected by automated weather stations located near the experimental fields which form part of the agroclimatic weather network of andalusia cruz blanco et al 2015 the water balance was initialized on 1st september of each year considering the soil water content equal to 20 of the total soil storage taking into account the previous crop and the weather conditions garcía lópez et al 2016 full irrigation scheduling was defined as that which avoided stress throughout the crop cycle but without generating over irrigation this was achieved by ensuring that the water stored in the soil at the end of the crop cycle did not exceed 20 of the maximum water storage garcía lópez et al 2016 finally based on experimentation described in garcía lópez et al 2016 a positive correlation between yield y and n supply x was found when the ratio of rainfall plus irrigation supply to optimal water supply to avoid crop water stress rws was higher than 0 75 y 2045 8 x 0 053 and y 1898 3 x 0 0721 for rws equal to 0 76 and 0 95 respectively however the correlation was negative for rws values around 0 5 y 1839 1 x 0 072 for rws equal to 0 53 2 3 scenarios simulation scenarios were conducted to examine economic components related to irrigation and sowing density fertilization and irrigation and sowing date and sowing density under rainfed conditions in these studies the profitability of sunflower is defined according to sunflower price seed costs and irrigation water fertilizer supply and cost depending on the source and availability of irrigation water and n fertilization cost can vary widely in the first study profit was calculated depending on sowing density 71 000 and 95 000 seeds ha irrigation supply rainfed severe deficit and non severe deficit irrigation and water cost ranging between 6 and 14 cents cubic meter in addition a fixed cost of 145 per 150 000 seeds was set and 150 ha for other costs such as soil management fertilization etc for both irrigated and rainfed systems three sunflower prices were considered based on previous and future projections 200 350 and 500 ton in the second study sunflower profit was calculated considering different irrigation supply severe deficit and full irrigation and fertilizer supply 10 50 100 and 150 n units ha with water cost equal to 6 cents cubic meter and fertilizer costs equal to 1 8 and 3 6 n unit with an additional fixed cost of 100 ha and sunflower price equal to 350 ton yield functions were developed based on the results obtained in the experimental trials under irrigation in ifapa alameda del obispo and under rainfed conditions in ifapa tomejil thresholds of profitability are defined as the irrigation water cost generating no profit a higher cost would generate economic losses implying that irrigation is not advisable 3 results 3 1 interactions between sowing density and sowing date under rainfed conditions average yield increased by 17 8 from 1490 to 1755 kg ha with the highest sowing density d1 100 000 plants ha relative to d2 60 000 plants ha table 3 breaking results down by location experiments located in jerez je showed the highest yields of all the rainfed trials r0 the highest sowing density d1 produced over 3300 kg ha an increase of 26 compared with the lower density d2 with this difference being statistically significant table 3 experiments in tomejil to also showed differences between the two densities for seed yield with d1 achieving a yield around 12 5 higher than d2 being statistically significant for to 2014 and to 2015 s2 on the other hand seed oil content revealed no significant differences between densities in any of the tests carried out in both locations during the three seasons table 3 equally sowing date had a great impact on yield resulting in average yields of 1502 4 and 1159 3 kg ha for early s1 and traditional sowing dates s2 respectively table 3 increases in seed yield were observed with early planting dates for the two years tested reaching 25 5 and 33 7 respectively although significant differences were only found in 2017 table 3 similarly significant differences in oil content were found in the two trials with s1 registering increases of 8 4 and 5 4 respectively over s2 table 3 when evaluating the effect of sowing density with different sowing dates on yield increases in yield were found when sowing density was increased for both early sowing date s1 and late sowing date s2 although the increases were higher with s2 thus the increase using d1 compared with d2 was equal to 3 5 and 11 5 for s1 and s2 respectively however the highest yields were found with d1 s1 strategies and the lowest with d2 s2 table 3 3 2 interactions between sowing density and irrigation supply the volume of irrigation supply had a positive effect on yield under deficit irrigation r2 and severe deficit irrigation r1 compared with rainfed experiments r0 thus average yields increased by 17 4 and 42 3 with r1 and r2 irrigation treatments respectively compared to r0 table 3 yield differences between r2 and r0 were significant in 2016 and 2017 but no significant differences in yield between r1 and r0 were found analyzing seed oil content oc this increased when irrigation supply increased thus oc was 42 7 43 8 and 46 4 for rainfed r1 and r2 respectively table 3 deficit irrigation treatment r2 showed a significantly higher oil content than for r0 in both years whereas differences between r1 and r0 resulted in significant differences only for 2017 trials table 3 in deficit and severe deficit irrigated trials sowing density had a significant impact on yield thus yield increased with high density sowing 1851 vs 1545 kg ha for d1 and d2 respectively however this effect of sowing density on yield was influenced by the water availability table 3 the yield increase from traditional sowing density d2 to high d1 was equal to 15 1 15 7 and 26 9 for r0 r1 and r2 respectively oil content showed a similar pattern albeit with smaller differences between treatments thus oil content increased under high density sowing d1 44 7 vs 43 9 for d1 and d2 respectively and was affected by the water availability with the highest increase around 4 1 registered for r2 and the lowest for r0 table 3 3 3 effect of the interactions between sowing density sowing date and irrigation supply on profit the evaluation of the profit curves under different irrigation strategies and sowing densities for the current sunflower price 350 ton revealed two clear patterns high density d1 generated curves with a positive slope especially when the irrigation supply was above 1000 m3 ha and when the irrigation water cost iwc was not high however the opposite trend was found when traditional plant population d2 was considered fig 3 a these differences are of critical importance to profit as the slope of the curves indicates whether or not a specific irrigation strategy is suitable if the slope is positive e g with d1 an irrigation supply of around 1500 m3 ha with iwc 10 cents m3 fig 3a the profit increases and so the irrigation practice can be considered appropriate if the slope is negative e g with d2 an irrigation supply of around 1500 m3 ha with iwc 10 cents m3 fig 3a the profit decreases and so the irrigation practice cannot be recommended the profit values and the threshold of profitability are clearly affected by the sunflower price with clear differences in terms of the recommended irrigation practice depending on this value fig 3 thus under the weather soil conditions of the guadalquivir valley in southern spain and with a sunflower price sp of 350 ton the threshold of profitability for sunflower the upper limit for irrigation water costs to be profitable with a limited irrigation supply below 1000 m3 ha was around 9 and 8 cents m3 for d1 and d2 respectively for a non severe deficit irrigation supply irrigation between 1000 and 2500 m3 ha the threshold was around 12 and 6 cents m3 for d1 and d2 respectively fig 3a however with sp 200 ton the irrigation supply below 1000 m3 ha was not profitable with any sowing density and between 1000 and 2500 m3 ha it was only profitable for d1 with a threshold equal to 7 cents m3 fig 3b finally with sp 500 ton and limited irrigation supply the threshold was 14 and 11 cents m3 for d1 and d2 respectively and for non severe deficit irrigation supply equal to 16 and 8 cents m3 for d1 and d2 respectively fig 3c economic analysis of profit patterns under rainfed conditions with different sunflower prices sp sowing dates and sowing densities fig 4 revealed a negligible impact of sowing density on profit compared with the effect of sowing date thus for sp 350 ton the average profit ranged between 78 4 and 198 5 ha for s1 and s2 respectively and between 134 8 and 142 1 ha for d2 and d1 respectively this profit is reduced even registering negative values when sp decreases to 200 ton and increases up to values of around 400 ha when sp reaches 500 ton with the pattern described above remaining constant fig 4 3 4 effect of the interactions between fertilization and irrigation supply on profit in the economic evaluation of irrigation and fertilizer supply under severely limited water supply the optimal n supply was very small even for low fertilization costs the maximum profit was obtained with 10 n units fig 5 however when water supply was close to the level required to avoid crop water stress rws around 1 with irrigation supply around 4500 m3 ha and the n fertilization cost was low around 1 8 n unit the n rate that maximized the profit was around 50 n units ha fig 5 for all other water supply and fertilization cost scenarios the recommendation was to supply the lowest n rates fig 5 when n fertilization costs were high the combination of irrigation and fertilization rates that maximized sunflower profit was deficit irrigation rws 0 76 together with very limited n fertilization 10 n units ha with low n fertilization costs the recommendation was similar requiring deficit irrigation rws 0 76 with irrigation supply around 3000 m3 ha with n fertilization of between 10 and 50 n units ha fig 5 4 discussion several sustainable intensification practices specific to sunflower crop have been evaluated in this study namely increasing sowing density bringing forward the sowing date and implementing efficient deficit irrigation and limited fertilization strategies this study complements previous studies uniquely focused on the optimization of deficit irrigation and n fertilization garcía lópez et al 2016 and provides an innovative approach to identify intensification strategies for sunflower the evaluation and integration of these intensification strategies is the result of the search for improved agricultural practices to overcome some of the drawbacks of traditional practices regarding unsustainable water use and nitrogen misuse which have high economic and environmental costs jury and vaux 2005 to date the most common intensification practice carried out in agricultural systems with limited water availability in southern spain has been the application of support irrigation strategies for traditional rainfed crops such as wheat or sunflower lorite et al 2012 in our study the analysis of irrigation for sunflower even though the full irrigation requirements were not met produced very satisfactory results with a significant increase in the yield of around 42 compared to the yield under rainfed conditions these results agree with those obtained by connor et al 1985 cox and jolliff 1986 and garcía lópez et al 2016 however the main limitation for implementing this intensification practice is the lack of available water resources for irrigation in many agricultural areas in southern spain thus the increase in sowing density emerges as an optimal intensification practice it is an easy cost effective measure in any agricultural area cultivated with sunflower based on the results of this study increases in yield of around 19 on average confirm the virtues of this practice however this increase was not equal under rainfed and under irrigated conditions indicating that the success of this agricultural practice depended on favorable water conditions thus under rainfed r0 and severe deficit irrigation r1 the yield increase was around 17 but with an efficient deficit irrigation strategy the increase reached 27 this multiplier effect of other agronomical practices implies an additional advantage of the irrigation even if it does not meet full water requirements additional advantages of irrigation were related to the decrease in canopy temperature reducing the impact of heat stress on yield in crops such as sunflower ploschuk and hall 1995 guilioni and lhomme 2006 garcía lópez et al 2014 wheat and maize siebert et al 2017 or preventing water stress during critical stages such as flowering rinaldi 2001 göksoy et al 2004 in line with the different behavior detected in this study depending on the irrigation supply previous studies evaluated the effect of different sowing densities on sunflower yield and seed oil content finding that the optimal plant population depended on the environmental conditions radford 1978 fernández et al 1980 garcía ruíz et al 1980 barros et al 2004 mcmaster et al 2012 ion et al 2015 thus in those studies the highest yields were reached for intensive plant populations but requiring favorable growing conditions conversely an increase in sowing density under less favorable growing conditions even led to a reduction in yields thus optimal plant populations vary greatly across environments the higher the potential yield according to the environment the higher the plant population should be in our rainfed trials this trend can be clearly perceived since both tests carried out in tomejil during 2017 s1 2017 and s2 2017 and the early sowing trial in 2015 s1 2015 show very similar yield values for both densities even detecting higher yields for lower densities s2 2017 evaluating the climatic conditions for these trials very high average maximum temperatures especially during the s2 2017 trial and low rainfall were found in critical periods for the crop hindering pollination and grain filling and therefore affecting the yields in the opposite case also in tomejil during the 2014 and 2015 s2 trials higher density led to significant differences of 46 and 28 respectively both trials registered the lowest average maximum temperatures of the historical series of the trials similarly the trial located in jerez had an acceptable amount of rain and milder maximum temperatures in the critical periods showing high yields with higher density generating a significant difference of 26 moreover the results obtained for irrigated trials confirm that the effect of increasing sowing density is enhanced when climatic conditions are satisfactory obtaining higher yields as consequence of increasing sowing density another sustainable intensification practice feasible under rainfed conditions and moderate winter temperatures is related to the advance in sowing date distinguishing between results from early and traditional sowing dates the early ones produced between 25 5 and 33 7 more seed yield and a significant increase in seed oil content of approximately 8 5 and 5 5 compared with traditional sowing dates these results agree with those obtained by unger 1980 jones 1984 gimeno et al 1989 and barros et al 2004 some authors found that early sowing dates produced even greater differences soriano et al 2004 obtained increases in seed yield of up to 52 by bringing the sowing date forward from march to december likewise sheoran et al 2015 concluded that a delay in the sowing date drastically reduced the crop yields to the tune of 33 37 in seed yield and 39 42 in oil yield in comparison to earlier sowing dates moreover the benefit of early planting dates is strengthened by the results obtained with the herbicide resistant varieties clearfield technology which register a similar performance in terms of seed yield and even significantly higher than the hybrids widely cultivated in spain sunflower hybrids resistant to race f when interactions between sowing date and sowing density were evaluated under rainfed conditions only small increases in yield were associated with increases in sowing density underlining the critical role of water availability on the outcomes of other agronomical practices under irrigated conditions the promotion of sustainable intensification practices must involve an efficient use of irrigation water in this way water losses can be avoided while also generating a positive economic value associated with irrigation which for some crops such as sunflower is not always possible however only a few studies have evaluated irrigation management for crops such as sunflower moreover some of these studies have found that the application of irrigation for these crops could generate negative incomes even if yield increased compared to rainfed conditions lorite et al 2012 garcía lópez et al 2016 as our study has proved the profitability of irrigated sunflower will depend on the sunflower price and the irrigation water costs but the role of sowing density is very relevant thus under specific circumstances the only way to obtain positive profits is by employing efficient deficit irrigation strategies however the yield must also be increased through some other additional intensification practice such as increasing sowing density equally the combination of irrigation strategies that prevent severe water stress with high sowing density contributes to raising the profitability of sunflower lastly an additional sustainable intensification strategy considered was the optimization of the n fertilization again the role of water availability was decisive with the response to n fertilization changing depending on water availability thus n rate reduction generated positive effects on root growth under rainfed conditions improving drought resistance wang et al 2019 these results confirm the need to develop integrated sustainable intensification strategies adapted to local conditions and including economic components webber et al 2018 intensification techniques have been considered as a strategy to increase the economic sustainability of agricultural systems struik and kuyper 2017 however using such strategies also helps to reduce the amount of irrigation and fertilization required thereby increasing the environmental sustainability of these systems thus in our study non maximum rates of irrigation and fertilization were required to maximize sunflower profit confirming the results obtained by sinha et al 2017 and wang et al 2019 in addition to the resulting economic benefits water savings and reductions in nitrate pollution were also achieved making this an excellent sustainable intensification strategy the agronomic practices considered in this study such as efficient irrigation and fertilization scheduling increases in sowing density or the promotion of early sowing dates have previously been independently evaluated barros et al 2004 garcía lópez et al 2014 2016 but their combination has not been addressed thus far this study has tried to close that gap thus traditionally the advisory services provided to farmers have been focused on irrigation fertilization or cultivar selection lorite et al 2012 however under current conditions of low agricultural profitability more integrated advice is required including the optimization and coordination of agronomic factors such as irrigation fertilization sowing date and sowing density in this study the individual effects of well known agricultural practices have been confirmed moreover the critical role of water availability in the satisfactory performance of intensification practices has been identified this component is often overlooked and so even when improved agricultural practices such as modifications in sowing date sowing density or fertilization have been correctly implemented the outcome may not be as expected the results of ecophysiological mechanisms related to drought sowing density or sowing date are well known even for crops such as sunflower diepenbrock et al 2001 hussain et al 2018 however the effects interactions of these mechanisms when different agricultural practices are combined are unknown this study constitutes the basis for assessing the effects of integrating different agricultural practices on physiological mechanisms such as radiation use efficiency or the stomatal response to water stress with the ultimate aim of developing mechanistic crop models to be used under future climate conditions thus under disturbing climate change scenarios where water availability for crops will be a limiting factor boosting water use efficiency will be critical to achieve this recent studies have emphasized the need to integrate management techniques farooq et al 2019 thus this study provides a first step in the promotion of intensification strategies in traditional rainfed crops such as sunflower a topic that has not been widely analyzed to date however additional experimental studies integrating different sowing dates density fertilization and irrigation strategies are still required similarly experimental work under different climate and agronomic conditions is necessary to provide more general recommendations to farmers cultivating sunflower under semi arid conditions finally by combining experimentation based on a wide range of agronomical practices and water availability with the development and analysis of economic scenarios this study provides an innovative tool for analyzing the performance of integrated intensification strategies for sunflower equally performing the analysis under different economic scenarios extends the applicability of this study to other regions and weather conditions making it useful for analyzing the sustainability of a wide range of agricultural systems today and in the future 5 conclusions through the concept of sustainable intensification this study evaluated a number of agronomical practices for traditional sunflower cultivation systems such as deficit irrigation strategies optimized fertilization practices related to water availability the use of high sowing densities and the application of early sowing dates analyzing individually the effects of each proposed agricultural practice on yield revealed that efficient deficit irrigation was the practice reporting the greatest benefits in terms of crop performance obtaining yield increases of 42 compared with rainfed fields an appropriate combination of agronomical practices enhanced the positive results on sunflower yield and profitability thus coordinating deficit irrigation strategies with high sowing densities resulted in yield increases of around 70 compared with rainfed systems and traditional sowing densities similarly the combination of high sowing densities with early sowing dates generated performance increases of approximately 40 compared to traditional techniques finally the interaction between fertilization rate and water availability resulted in significant n fertilization savings when irrigation rainfall supply was very limited all these results emphasize the vital importance of proper water management for the sustainability of agricultural systems under semi arid conditions economic analyses under a wide range of scenarios confirmed the optimal performance when sowing density deficit irrigation and n fertilization strategies were coordinated equally profitability thresholds relating to yield harvest price and irrigation water costs were improved when deficit irrigation and high sowing density were integrated however despite the evident improvements in yield crop profitability and sustainability generated by the correct coordination of intensification measures described and evaluated in this study their use has not been widely applied by farmers in southern spain thus an effort to promote advisory services and technology transfer to farmers and technicians is required to increase the sustainability of these agricultural systems acknowledgements the authors would like to express their gratitude to the

10926,under semi arid conditions water is the most limiting factor for ensuring the sustainability of mediterranean agriculture proper management of practices such as irrigation fertilization and changes in sowing date and sowing density can contribute decisively to efficient water management in these agricultural systems thus the aim of this study was to assess the effect in terms of yield and profit of combining those agricultural practices and subsequently to define strategies for the sustainable intensification of semi arid agricultural systems in southern spain the study focused on sunflower as a representative crop sustainable intensification practices were evaluated through a series of experiments revealing the prominent role played by water availability in their performance thus high sowing density provided much more satisfactory yield results compared to the traditional sowing density and it was observed that this yield increase was related to water availability higher yield increases around 27 were obtained with deficit irrigation strategies than under severe deficit irrigation or rainfed conditions around 16 other intensification strategies such as support irrigation and early sowing date also generated satisfactory yield increases around 45 and 30 respectively finally interactions between irrigation and fertilization indicated that under limited water availability very low n fertilization rates were required all these results led to the conclusion that the combination of high sowing densities early sowing date deficit irrigation and limited fertilization constitutes an innovative intensification strategy for sunflower under semi arid conditions an economic analysis of the proposed agricultural practices also revealed a clear connection between water availability and optimized management of sowing density sowing date and fertilization these results confirmed that technical advisory services provided to farmers should focus on integrated site specific crop management especially under semi arid conditions with severely limited water availability keywords water availability sustainable intensification deficit irrigation strategies sowing density sowing date semi arid conditions 1 introduction rainfed agriculture plays a significant role in the agricultural systems of southern europe this type of agriculture is mainly based on specific low input cultivation techniques for wheat sunflower and legume crops that allow efficient and effective use of limited soil moisture agriculture is one of the sectors most vulnerable to the impact of global climate change tingem et al 2009 and rainfed systems are especially vulnerable to changes in weather conditions valverde et al 2015 the general circulation models gmcs of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc have predicted strong warming over western and southern europe during summer with increases in mean summer temperatures exceeding 6 c by the end of the century and substantial decreases in summer precipitation in southern and central europe ipcc 2014 furthermore heat waves and droughts are predicted to occur more often due to the combined effect of warmer temperatures and less precipitation lotze campen 2011 spain has a total of 17 m ha of farmland of which only 3 5 m ha are cultivated under irrigation while the rest are rainfed crops in these rainfed systems sunflower is a relevant crop globally the european union is the third largest sunflower producer in the world behind ukraine and russia mapama 2016 spain ranks fourth or fifth in terms of eu countries sunflower yield depending on climatological factors mainly drought by cultivated area it lies in third place behind romania and bulgaria in 2016 in spain around 730 000 ha was dedicated to sunflower cultivation and in andalusia the region with the largest cultivated area this crop was cultivated on around 260 000 ha of which only 5 was cultivated under irrigation mapama 2016 consequently the sunflower crop in its traditional production areas such as the guadalquivir valley in andalusia will be exposed to severe impacts of climate change related to water shortages and high temperatures debaeke et al 2017 especially when these climatic conditions happen during the critical periods of the crop cycle from early flowering to the achene filling stage garcía lópez et al 2014 in addition to these impacts the scarcity of available adaptation strategies for rainfed agriculture could be a limiting factor for the future economic sustainability of agricultural systems cultivated with sunflower throughout history farmers have responded to changes in the environment by adopting new crop cultivars and by adjusting their cultural practices gala bijl and fisher 2011 at the farm level examples of these adaptations include alterations in planting and harvest dates changes in cropping sequence better water management in irrigation systems optimized use of fertilizers and adoption of improved tillage practices adams et al 1998 in addition to the concerns related to climate change the productivity of rainfed sunﬂower under mediterranean conditions is currently low figueiredo et al 2017 and is strongly dependent on water availability and the water use efﬁciency of the crop barros et al 2004 soriano et al 2004 water is by far the most limiting factor for rainfed sunﬂower production although other factors such as temperature during flowering stage garcía lópez et al 2014 fertilization garcía lópez et al 2016 sowing date and sowing density may show an influential interaction with water supply diepenbrock et al 2001 barros et al 2004 thus the abovementioned limiting factors relating to future climate change will require combining production intensification strategies with strategies aimed at improving the efficiency of the systems these practices have recently been integrated under the term sustainable intensification gadanakis et al 2015 kumar et al 2018 the implementation of efficient deficit irrigation practices is one of the main sustainable intensification actions proposed for sunflower systems in southern spain garcía lópez et al 2016 although the irrigation of low income crops such as sunflower is not yet common lorite et al 2012 equally proper management of sowing density is one of the most widely recommended agricultural practices to achieve an increase in crop productivity escalante estrada et al 2008 jia et al 2018 thus an appropriate number of individual plants per unit area may enable a better use of water and nutritional resources increasing density reduces biomass and yield per plant but biomass production and seed yield per unit area are higher vega muñoz et al 2001 the optimum sowing density for sunﬂower is inﬂuenced by several factors such as temperature soil fertility water availability and genotype villalobos et al 1994 diepenbrock et al 2001 in recent years the need to increase yields and thereby to improve crop productivity and profitability has encouraged an increase in sowing density this practice has been promoted in response to the negative trend in sunflower yields in andalusia since the late 80 s garcía ruiz et al 2008 this decline may have been caused by the sudden appearance of sunflower broomrape orobanche cumana wallr in traditional areas of cultivation which led to the substitution of older varieties that were highly productive but also very susceptible to the parasite garcía ruiz et al 2008 therefore seed companies primary objective has been to quickly breed broomrape resistant varieties leaving yield and oil content as a lower priority another agricultural practice in semi arid mediterranean environments is the implementation of early sowing dates nouri et al 2017 allowing the crop to beneﬁt from moderate temperatures at the end of the crop cycle garcía lópez et al 2014 and from late winter rainfall reducing the volume of water required to sustain the yield sarno et al 1992 soriano et al 2004 garcía lópez et al 2016 conversely the delay in sowing date shortens the growing cycle decreasing the amount of radiation intercepted during the growing season and thus the total dry matter at harvest andrade 1995 sunderman et al 1997 therefore to maximize the use of natural resources the selection of an appropriate sowing date is a critical issue since it ensures good seed germination as well as the timely appearance of seedlings and the optimum development of the root system equally a suitable sowing date allows the critical periods for oil yield and its components to overlap with the part of the growing season when the most environmental resources are available balalic et al 2012 the practice of winter sowing for sunflower in andalusia was first developed in the 1980s studies carried out during that period in the region such as gimeno et al 1989 showed clear increases in yield of up to 30 over the usual yield for the area however this shift in the sowing date was not put into practice by the farmers because of the difficulty in carrying out proper weed control weed interference increases the risk of crop yield losses despite the technological progress made in weed control korres et al 2016 an advance in the sowing date resulted in a greater abundance of winter weeds which in the conventional spring sowings are easily controlled by land tilling prior to planting under these circumstances the sowing density is key to effective inter row tillage the distance between the sowing lines must be at least 65 cm which entails densities from around 60 000 plants ha this is a critical requisite as in the past it was not feasible to integrate an early sowing date with high sowing density with the appearance in recent years of herbicide resistant cultivars clearfield and expresssun technology a clear opportunity to solve those limitations has been identified but new research studies are needed to be able to take advantage of these opportunities finally correct fertilization coordinated with the irrigation supply constitutes an essential factor for optimal crop management debaeke et al 2006 sinha et al 2017 and represents a useful sustainable intensification technique especially in systems affected by severe water stress garcía lópez et al 2016 despite their low profitability extensive crops play an important role in the agriculture systems of southern europe however while previous studies have described a significant number of agronomic practices for increasing the crop sustainability of extensive crops such as maize welde and gebremariam 2016 or wheat abolpour 2018 few studies have done so for sunflower given the new challenges described above and in order to fill the gap in the literature specifically regarding sunflower the main objective of this study was to evaluate different sustainable intensification strategies for mediterranean agricultural systems cultivated with sunflower the strategies analyzed were increases in sowing density changes in the sowing dates and limited irrigation and fertilizer supply furthermore the interaction between these strategies was also assessed in order to determine whether these new crop management approaches have a positive influence on the economic sustainability of these agricultural systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiments with sustainable intensification practices four sustainable intensification practices related to sowing date and density irrigation and fertilization management fig 1 and their interactions with water availability were evaluated through a study conducted during six growing seasons from 2012 to 2017 in three experimental fields located at ifapa alameda del obispo córdoba ifapa tomejil carmona and ifapa rancho de la merced jerez de la frontera in andalusia southern spain fig 2 the climate in córdoba and carmona both located in the guadalquivir valley is considered semi arid with the rainy period concentrated between autumn and spring and with a very hot dry summer season different weather conditions are found in jerez which is located closer to the coast with a different rainfall pattern lower maximum temperatures and higher relative humidity at the ifapa alameda del obispo experimental farm located near the city of córdoba latitude 37º 51 42 n longitude 04º 48 0 w two trials were carried out during the 2012 and 2013 seasons aimed at evaluating the interaction between fertilization and irrigation supply in addition during the 2016 and 2017 seasons two trials were run to evaluate the interaction between sowing density and irrigation supply table 1 the 2012 and 2013 trials are fully described in garcía lópez et al 2016 the 2016 and 2017 trials were arranged as strip plot designs with four replications where irrigation rates were the main plots and sowing density were the sub plots experimental plots consisted of 4 rows with a north south orientation 10 m long 70 cm apart and two distances between plants within rows 20 and 15 cm resulting in plant populations of around 70 000 d2 and 95 000 d1 plants ha respectively both trials were seeded with lg 5537 ho cultivar limagrain for the irrigation treatments a drip irrigation system with 75 cm drip emitter spacing was used two strategies were considered in these treatments providing around 15 and 40 of the full irrigation requirements of the crop for r1 and r2 strategy respectively thus for each year and trial different irrigation scheduling was used providing 82 246 123 and 232 5 mm for the trials co 2016 r1 co 2016 r2 co 2017 r1 and co 2017 r2 respectively representing 12 8 38 5 19 9 and 37 7 of the full water requirements full irrigation scheduling was based on a water balance approach described later in section 2 2 the other six trials were carried out under rainfed conditions one located in ifapa rancho de la merced experimental farm situated near the city of jerez de la frontera cádiz latitude 36 38 33 n longitude 06 00 48 w in 2015 and five located in ifapa tomejil experimental farm situated near the city of carmona seville latitude 37 24 07 n longitude 05 35 10 w in 2014 2015 and 2017 table 1 all of them were arranged as strip plot designs with four replications where the main factor was sowing density and the secondary factor was varieties in addition in 2015 and 2017 in the trials carried out in ifapa tomejil two different sowing dates were used per year conventional sowing dates s2 and winter sowing dates s1 table 2 experimental plots consisted of 4 rows 70 cm apart or 6 rows 40 cm apart 10 m long and 25 cm between plants within rows obtaining approximate densities of 60 000 d2 and 100 000 d1 plants per hectare respectively for the trial conducted in 2014 and the three trials carried out in 2015 three cultivars were used one hybrid resistant to race f of sunflower broomrape orobanche cumana wallr one hybrid resistant to pulsar40 herbicide based on clearfield technology and one hybrid resistant to granstar50 herbicide based on expresssuntm technology the clearfield technology consists of hybrids with resistance to herbicides of the imidazolinone family and the expresssuntm technology involves hybrids that are tolerant to a herbicide of the sulfonylureas family lastly for the two trials of 2017 only two varieties were used the hybrid resistant to the race f sunflower broomrape and the hybrid with clearfield technology in each trial and replication phenology stages were identified table 2 by periodical visits to experimental fields in addition seed yield and seed oil content were assessed by harvesting all the plants from the two central rows of the trials to avoid crop border effects seed oil content was estimated using nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy 2 2 crop water requirements irrigation scheduling and fertilization irrigation scheduling and crop water stress assessment for each irrigated trial were computed using a water balance approach based on allen et al 1998 and previously described in garcía lópez et al 2016 thus using a cascade approach a daily water balance was computed for each field including rainfall and irrigation as inputs and superficial runoff deep percolation soil evaporation and crop transpiration as outputs lorite et al 2004 a key component of crop water stress and irrigation scheduling is the accurate assessment of crop water requirements using crop coefficients allen et al 1998 in this study the methodology for assessing crop basal coefficients kcb entailed assessing crop ground cover by means of overhead digital pictures using the greencrop tracker software pattey and liu 2010 these pictures were taken with variable temporal frequency depending on the crop stage table 2 daily kcb values were calculated based on the available images and using an interpolation technique based on a spline function santos et al 2008 trezza et al 2013 these daily values and the reference evapotranspiration eto provide the crop transpiration the key component for assessing crop water requirements weather data and eto were collected by automated weather stations located near the experimental fields which form part of the agroclimatic weather network of andalusia cruz blanco et al 2015 the water balance was initialized on 1st september of each year considering the soil water content equal to 20 of the total soil storage taking into account the previous crop and the weather conditions garcía lópez et al 2016 full irrigation scheduling was defined as that which avoided stress throughout the crop cycle but without generating over irrigation this was achieved by ensuring that the water stored in the soil at the end of the crop cycle did not exceed 20 of the maximum water storage garcía lópez et al 2016 finally based on experimentation described in garcía lópez et al 2016 a positive correlation between yield y and n supply x was found when the ratio of rainfall plus irrigation supply to optimal water supply to avoid crop water stress rws was higher than 0 75 y 2045 8 x 0 053 and y 1898 3 x 0 0721 for rws equal to 0 76 and 0 95 respectively however the correlation was negative for rws values around 0 5 y 1839 1 x 0 072 for rws equal to 0 53 2 3 scenarios simulation scenarios were conducted to examine economic components related to irrigation and sowing density fertilization and irrigation and sowing date and sowing density under rainfed conditions in these studies the profitability of sunflower is defined according to sunflower price seed costs and irrigation water fertilizer supply and cost depending on the source and availability of irrigation water and n fertilization cost can vary widely in the first study profit was calculated depending on sowing density 71 000 and 95 000 seeds ha irrigation supply rainfed severe deficit and non severe deficit irrigation and water cost ranging between 6 and 14 cents cubic meter in addition a fixed cost of 145 per 150 000 seeds was set and 150 ha for other costs such as soil management fertilization etc for both irrigated and rainfed systems three sunflower prices were considered based on previous and future projections 200 350 and 500 ton in the second study sunflower profit was calculated considering different irrigation supply severe deficit and full irrigation and fertilizer supply 10 50 100 and 150 n units ha with water cost equal to 6 cents cubic meter and fertilizer costs equal to 1 8 and 3 6 n unit with an additional fixed cost of 100 ha and sunflower price equal to 350 ton yield functions were developed based on the results obtained in the experimental trials under irrigation in ifapa alameda del obispo and under rainfed conditions in ifapa tomejil thresholds of profitability are defined as the irrigation water cost generating no profit a higher cost would generate economic losses implying that irrigation is not advisable 3 results 3 1 interactions between sowing density and sowing date under rainfed conditions average yield increased by 17 8 from 1490 to 1755 kg ha with the highest sowing density d1 100 000 plants ha relative to d2 60 000 plants ha table 3 breaking results down by location experiments located in jerez je showed the highest yields of all the rainfed trials r0 the highest sowing density d1 produced over 3300 kg ha an increase of 26 compared with the lower density d2 with this difference being statistically significant table 3 experiments in tomejil to also showed differences between the two densities for seed yield with d1 achieving a yield around 12 5 higher than d2 being statistically significant for to 2014 and to 2015 s2 on the other hand seed oil content revealed no significant differences between densities in any of the tests carried out in both locations during the three seasons table 3 equally sowing date had a great impact on yield resulting in average yields of 1502 4 and 1159 3 kg ha for early s1 and traditional sowing dates s2 respectively table 3 increases in seed yield were observed with early planting dates for the two years tested reaching 25 5 and 33 7 respectively although significant differences were only found in 2017 table 3 similarly significant differences in oil content were found in the two trials with s1 registering increases of 8 4 and 5 4 respectively over s2 table 3 when evaluating the effect of sowing density with different sowing dates on yield increases in yield were found when sowing density was increased for both early sowing date s1 and late sowing date s2 although the increases were higher with s2 thus the increase using d1 compared with d2 was equal to 3 5 and 11 5 for s1 and s2 respectively however the highest yields were found with d1 s1 strategies and the lowest with d2 s2 table 3 3 2 interactions between sowing density and irrigation supply the volume of irrigation supply had a positive effect on yield under deficit irrigation r2 and severe deficit irrigation r1 compared with rainfed experiments r0 thus average yields increased by 17 4 and 42 3 with r1 and r2 irrigation treatments respectively compared to r0 table 3 yield differences between r2 and r0 were significant in 2016 and 2017 but no significant differences in yield between r1 and r0 were found analyzing seed oil content oc this increased when irrigation supply increased thus oc was 42 7 43 8 and 46 4 for rainfed r1 and r2 respectively table 3 deficit irrigation treatment r2 showed a significantly higher oil content than for r0 in both years whereas differences between r1 and r0 resulted in significant differences only for 2017 trials table 3 in deficit and severe deficit irrigated trials sowing density had a significant impact on yield thus yield increased with high density sowing 1851 vs 1545 kg ha for d1 and d2 respectively however this effect of sowing density on yield was influenced by the water availability table 3 the yield increase from traditional sowing density d2 to high d1 was equal to 15 1 15 7 and 26 9 for r0 r1 and r2 respectively oil content showed a similar pattern albeit with smaller differences between treatments thus oil content increased under high density sowing d1 44 7 vs 43 9 for d1 and d2 respectively and was affected by the water availability with the highest increase around 4 1 registered for r2 and the lowest for r0 table 3 3 3 effect of the interactions between sowing density sowing date and irrigation supply on profit the evaluation of the profit curves under different irrigation strategies and sowing densities for the current sunflower price 350 ton revealed two clear patterns high density d1 generated curves with a positive slope especially when the irrigation supply was above 1000 m3 ha and when the irrigation water cost iwc was not high however the opposite trend was found when traditional plant population d2 was considered fig 3 a these differences are of critical importance to profit as the slope of the curves indicates whether or not a specific irrigation strategy is suitable if the slope is positive e g with d1 an irrigation supply of around 1500 m3 ha with iwc 10 cents m3 fig 3a the profit increases and so the irrigation practice can be considered appropriate if the slope is negative e g with d2 an irrigation supply of around 1500 m3 ha with iwc 10 cents m3 fig 3a the profit decreases and so the irrigation practice cannot be recommended the profit values and the threshold of profitability are clearly affected by the sunflower price with clear differences in terms of the recommended irrigation practice depending on this value fig 3 thus under the weather soil conditions of the guadalquivir valley in southern spain and with a sunflower price sp of 350 ton the threshold of profitability for sunflower the upper limit for irrigation water costs to be profitable with a limited irrigation supply below 1000 m3 ha was around 9 and 8 cents m3 for d1 and d2 respectively for a non severe deficit irrigation supply irrigation between 1000 and 2500 m3 ha the threshold was around 12 and 6 cents m3 for d1 and d2 respectively fig 3a however with sp 200 ton the irrigation supply below 1000 m3 ha was not profitable with any sowing density and between 1000 and 2500 m3 ha it was only profitable for d1 with a threshold equal to 7 cents m3 fig 3b finally with sp 500 ton and limited irrigation supply the threshold was 14 and 11 cents m3 for d1 and d2 respectively and for non severe deficit irrigation supply equal to 16 and 8 cents m3 for d1 and d2 respectively fig 3c economic analysis of profit patterns under rainfed conditions with different sunflower prices sp sowing dates and sowing densities fig 4 revealed a negligible impact of sowing density on profit compared with the effect of sowing date thus for sp 350 ton the average profit ranged between 78 4 and 198 5 ha for s1 and s2 respectively and between 134 8 and 142 1 ha for d2 and d1 respectively this profit is reduced even registering negative values when sp decreases to 200 ton and increases up to values of around 400 ha when sp reaches 500 ton with the pattern described above remaining constant fig 4 3 4 effect of the interactions between fertilization and irrigation supply on profit in the economic evaluation of irrigation and fertilizer supply under severely limited water supply the optimal n supply was very small even for low fertilization costs the maximum profit was obtained with 10 n units fig 5 however when water supply was close to the level required to avoid crop water stress rws around 1 with irrigation supply around 4500 m3 ha and the n fertilization cost was low around 1 8 n unit the n rate that maximized the profit was around 50 n units ha fig 5 for all other water supply and fertilization cost scenarios the recommendation was to supply the lowest n rates fig 5 when n fertilization costs were high the combination of irrigation and fertilization rates that maximized sunflower profit was deficit irrigation rws 0 76 together with very limited n fertilization 10 n units ha with low n fertilization costs the recommendation was similar requiring deficit irrigation rws 0 76 with irrigation supply around 3000 m3 ha with n fertilization of between 10 and 50 n units ha fig 5 4 discussion several sustainable intensification practices specific to sunflower crop have been evaluated in this study namely increasing sowing density bringing forward the sowing date and implementing efficient deficit irrigation and limited fertilization strategies this study complements previous studies uniquely focused on the optimization of deficit irrigation and n fertilization garcía lópez et al 2016 and provides an innovative approach to identify intensification strategies for sunflower the evaluation and integration of these intensification strategies is the result of the search for improved agricultural practices to overcome some of the drawbacks of traditional practices regarding unsustainable water use and nitrogen misuse which have high economic and environmental costs jury and vaux 2005 to date the most common intensification practice carried out in agricultural systems with limited water availability in southern spain has been the application of support irrigation strategies for traditional rainfed crops such as wheat or sunflower lorite et al 2012 in our study the analysis of irrigation for sunflower even though the full irrigation requirements were not met produced very satisfactory results with a significant increase in the yield of around 42 compared to the yield under rainfed conditions these results agree with those obtained by connor et al 1985 cox and jolliff 1986 and garcía lópez et al 2016 however the main limitation for implementing this intensification practice is the lack of available water resources for irrigation in many agricultural areas in southern spain thus the increase in sowing density emerges as an optimal intensification practice it is an easy cost effective measure in any agricultural area cultivated with sunflower based on the results of this study increases in yield of around 19 on average confirm the virtues of this practice however this increase was not equal under rainfed and under irrigated conditions indicating that the success of this agricultural practice depended on favorable water conditions thus under rainfed r0 and severe deficit irrigation r1 the yield increase was around 17 but with an efficient deficit irrigation strategy the increase reached 27 this multiplier effect of other agronomical practices implies an additional advantage of the irrigation even if it does not meet full water requirements additional advantages of irrigation were related to the decrease in canopy temperature reducing the impact of heat stress on yield in crops such as sunflower ploschuk and hall 1995 guilioni and lhomme 2006 garcía lópez et al 2014 wheat and maize siebert et al 2017 or preventing water stress during critical stages such as flowering rinaldi 2001 göksoy et al 2004 in line with the different behavior detected in this study depending on the irrigation supply previous studies evaluated the effect of different sowing densities on sunflower yield and seed oil content finding that the optimal plant population depended on the environmental conditions radford 1978 fernández et al 1980 garcía ruíz et al 1980 barros et al 2004 mcmaster et al 2012 ion et al 2015 thus in those studies the highest yields were reached for intensive plant populations but requiring favorable growing conditions conversely an increase in sowing density under less favorable growing conditions even led to a reduction in yields thus optimal plant populations vary greatly across environments the higher the potential yield according to the environment the higher the plant population should be in our rainfed trials this trend can be clearly perceived since both tests carried out in tomejil during 2017 s1 2017 and s2 2017 and the early sowing trial in 2015 s1 2015 show very similar yield values for both densities even detecting higher yields for lower densities s2 2017 evaluating the climatic conditions for these trials very high average maximum temperatures especially during the s2 2017 trial and low rainfall were found in critical periods for the crop hindering pollination and grain filling and therefore affecting the yields in the opposite case also in tomejil during the 2014 and 2015 s2 trials higher density led to significant differences of 46 and 28 respectively both trials registered the lowest average maximum temperatures of the historical series of the trials similarly the trial located in jerez had an acceptable amount of rain and milder maximum temperatures in the critical periods showing high yields with higher density generating a significant difference of 26 moreover the results obtained for irrigated trials confirm that the effect of increasing sowing density is enhanced when climatic conditions are satisfactory obtaining higher yields as consequence of increasing sowing density another sustainable intensification practice feasible under rainfed conditions and moderate winter temperatures is related to the advance in sowing date distinguishing between results from early and traditional sowing dates the early ones produced between 25 5 and 33 7 more seed yield and a significant increase in seed oil content of approximately 8 5 and 5 5 compared with traditional sowing dates these results agree with those obtained by unger 1980 jones 1984 gimeno et al 1989 and barros et al 2004 some authors found that early sowing dates produced even greater differences soriano et al 2004 obtained increases in seed yield of up to 52 by bringing the sowing date forward from march to december likewise sheoran et al 2015 concluded that a delay in the sowing date drastically reduced the crop yields to the tune of 33 37 in seed yield and 39 42 in oil yield in comparison to earlier sowing dates moreover the benefit of early planting dates is strengthened by the results obtained with the herbicide resistant varieties clearfield technology which register a similar performance in terms of seed yield and even significantly higher than the hybrids widely cultivated in spain sunflower hybrids resistant to race f when interactions between sowing date and sowing density were evaluated under rainfed conditions only small increases in yield were associated with increases in sowing density underlining the critical role of water availability on the outcomes of other agronomical practices under irrigated conditions the promotion of sustainable intensification practices must involve an efficient use of irrigation water in this way water losses can be avoided while also generating a positive economic value associated with irrigation which for some crops such as sunflower is not always possible however only a few studies have evaluated irrigation management for crops such as sunflower moreover some of these studies have found that the application of irrigation for these crops could generate negative incomes even if yield increased compared to rainfed conditions lorite et al 2012 garcía lópez et al 2016 as our study has proved the profitability of irrigated sunflower will depend on the sunflower price and the irrigation water costs but the role of sowing density is very relevant thus under specific circumstances the only way to obtain positive profits is by employing efficient deficit irrigation strategies however the yield must also be increased through some other additional intensification practice such as increasing sowing density equally the combination of irrigation strategies that prevent severe water stress with high sowing density contributes to raising the profitability of sunflower lastly an additional sustainable intensification strategy considered was the optimization of the n fertilization again the role of water availability was decisive with the response to n fertilization changing depending on water availability thus n rate reduction generated positive effects on root growth under rainfed conditions improving drought resistance wang et al 2019 these results confirm the need to develop integrated sustainable intensification strategies adapted to local conditions and including economic components webber et al 2018 intensification techniques have been considered as a strategy to increase the economic sustainability of agricultural systems struik and kuyper 2017 however using such strategies also helps to reduce the amount of irrigation and fertilization required thereby increasing the environmental sustainability of these systems thus in our study non maximum rates of irrigation and fertilization were required to maximize sunflower profit confirming the results obtained by sinha et al 2017 and wang et al 2019 in addition to the resulting economic benefits water savings and reductions in nitrate pollution were also achieved making this an excellent sustainable intensification strategy the agronomic practices considered in this study such as efficient irrigation and fertilization scheduling increases in sowing density or the promotion of early sowing dates have previously been independently evaluated barros et al 2004 garcía lópez et al 2014 2016 but their combination has not been addressed thus far this study has tried to close that gap thus traditionally the advisory services provided to farmers have been focused on irrigation fertilization or cultivar selection lorite et al 2012 however under current conditions of low agricultural profitability more integrated advice is required including the optimization and coordination of agronomic factors such as irrigation fertilization sowing date and sowing density in this study the individual effects of well known agricultural practices have been confirmed moreover the critical role of water availability in the satisfactory performance of intensification practices has been identified this component is often overlooked and so even when improved agricultural practices such as modifications in sowing date sowing density or fertilization have been correctly implemented the outcome may not be as expected the results of ecophysiological mechanisms related to drought sowing density or sowing date are well known even for crops such as sunflower diepenbrock et al 2001 hussain et al 2018 however the effects interactions of these mechanisms when different agricultural practices are combined are unknown this study constitutes the basis for assessing the effects of integrating different agricultural practices on physiological mechanisms such as radiation use efficiency or the stomatal response to water stress with the ultimate aim of developing mechanistic crop models to be used under future climate conditions thus under disturbing climate change scenarios where water availability for crops will be a limiting factor boosting water use efficiency will be critical to achieve this recent studies have emphasized the need to integrate management techniques farooq et al 2019 thus this study provides a first step in the promotion of intensification strategies in traditional rainfed crops such as sunflower a topic that has not been widely analyzed to date however additional experimental studies integrating different sowing dates density fertilization and irrigation strategies are still required similarly experimental work under different climate and agronomic conditions is necessary to provide more general recommendations to farmers cultivating sunflower under semi arid conditions finally by combining experimentation based on a wide range of agronomical practices and water availability with the development and analysis of economic scenarios this study provides an innovative tool for analyzing the performance of integrated intensification strategies for sunflower equally performing the analysis under different economic scenarios extends the applicability of this study to other regions and weather conditions making it useful for analyzing the sustainability of a wide range of agricultural systems today and in the future 5 conclusions through the concept of sustainable intensification this study evaluated a number of agronomical practices for traditional sunflower cultivation systems such as deficit irrigation strategies optimized fertilization practices related to water availability the use of high sowing densities and the application of early sowing dates analyzing individually the effects of each proposed agricultural practice on yield revealed that efficient deficit irrigation was the practice reporting the greatest benefits in terms of crop performance obtaining yield increases of 42 compared with rainfed fields an appropriate combination of agronomical practices enhanced the positive results on sunflower yield and profitability thus coordinating deficit irrigation strategies with high sowing densities resulted in yield increases of around 70 compared with rainfed systems and traditional sowing densities similarly the combination of high sowing densities with early sowing dates generated performance increases of approximately 40 compared to traditional techniques finally the interaction between fertilization rate and water availability resulted in significant n fertilization savings when irrigation rainfall supply was very limited all these results emphasize the vital importance of proper water management for the sustainability of agricultural systems under semi arid conditions economic analyses under a wide range of scenarios confirmed the optimal performance when sowing density deficit irrigation and n fertilization strategies were coordinated equally profitability thresholds relating to yield harvest price and irrigation water costs were improved when deficit irrigation and high sowing density were integrated however despite the evident improvements in yield crop profitability and sustainability generated by the correct coordination of intensification measures described and evaluated in this study their use has not been widely applied by farmers in southern spain thus an effort to promote advisory services and technology transfer to farmers and technicians is required to increase the sustainability of these agricultural systems acknowledgements the authors would like to express their gratitude to the

10927,automatic irrigation in the soil and water assessment tool swat is triggered by using plant water stress and soil water deficit irrigation scheduling auto irrigation is important to simulate the catchment s behavior in response to climate change and water management scenarios however studies have identified deficiencies in the auto irrigation algorithms in swat as the irrigation water amount simulated under plant water stress scheduling shows a large deviation from the simulated irrigation water amount under soil water deficit scheduling therefore the current research deals with validating and modifying the auto irrigation scheduling under plant water stress condition using swat the modified swat model was evaluated against the soil water atmosphere plant swap model as well as observed data for irrigation and crop yield at an experimental field hamerstorf lower saxony germany during the 2008 2018 cropping seasons the two swat subroutines swu and autoirr were modified the existing root density distribution function was replaced with the one proposed by li et al 1998 and also a dynamic estimation of the plant water uptake compensation factor epco was incorporated into the modified swat the results revealed that swap and modified swat were able to simulate the irrigation amount and crop yield with an acceptable bias for all the crops at the experimental site however the overall spread of crop yield simulated 11 years by both the models was less compared to the observed spread for most of the crops furthermore the modified swat code was used to simulate the irrigation amount for three different agro climatic catchments in germany india and vietnam results showed improved irrigation simulation in terms of long term annual amounts compared to the default swat under plant water stress condition keywords root water uptake irrigation auto irrigation swat swap 1 introduction plant water uptake plays a main role in water transfer in the soil plant and atmosphere continuum feddes et al 2001 it is estimated that 65 of the precipitation is returned to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration et which depends on plant water uptake oki and kanae 2006 water availability enhances the plant water uptake processes in irrigated agricultural fields irrigated agriculture provides an enormous contribution to global food supply and security by producing approximately 40 of food and agricultural commodities on only 20 of the agricultural area kadiresan and khanal 2018 hence the quality of simulations in agricultural water management depends on a good implementation of root water uptake albasha et al 2015 water availability and water demand are two important aspects of sustainable water resources management the increase in water scarcity due to the overuse of limited water resources is a real threat to sustainable water resources development in many parts of the world irrigated agriculture is the most relevant consumer of water worldwide population growth and climate change will most probably lead to further increasing irrigation water demand elliott et al 2014 as water is a highly managed commodity in irrigation systems therefore improving the simulation of root water uptake rwu in agro hydrological models will foster improvements in resource utilization at global regional and field scales research on rwu has resulted in the development of models that vary from conceptual to highly complex physically based models feddes 1982 described one dimensional water flow in a heterogeneous soil root system in which the sink term was integrated over the plant s rooting depth this model was later improved by peters et al 2017 who extended its application to limited aeration and under low water potential conditions jarvis 1989 described root water uptake as a function of potential et and a weighted stress index which depends on vertical root distribution and water content in the soil li et al 1998 developed an exponential root water extraction function to account for non uniform root distribution in the soil profile and this was implemented into the soil water plant atmosphere swap model jarvis 2011 developed a parsimonious physically based uptake compensation model that requires fewer parameters than the other empirical approaches peters 2016 introduced a constraint to compensate for too high transpiration rates in the empirical model developed by jarvis 2011 even though the number of parameters used in the aforementioned models is low their correct estimation is important for simulating root water uptake de willigen et al 2012 evaluated root water uptake from three soil water flow models of different complexity and revealed that soil physical and root physiological factors are important for root water uptake modeling ojha et al 2009 examined the performance of different root water extraction models using available data as well as data generated under controlled conditions the result stresses that the nonlinear parameters in the model can define the nonlinearity in plant water uptake van lier et al 2008 developed a physically based root water uptake model containing a compensation mechanism based on the matric flux potential m and different root parameters the proposed reduction function was built into the swap model and predictions were compared to the feddes model results revealed that the developed function can simulate the compensated root water uptake without increasing the number of input parameters or degrading model performance even though rwu is a very small component of the water cycle but it affects one of the most important losses occurring in the system evapotranspiration et and this makes it sensitive towards the water cycle in addition this is a highly complicated and heterogeneous process occurring inside the soil macroscopic empirical rwu models are often used in hydrological studies to predict water dynamics through the soil plant atmosphere continuum they have an edge over the other models as they do not require complete insight into the physical processes of root water uptake thereby eliminating the need for parameters that are difficult to obtain ojha et al 2009 it can be assessed from the literature that rwu in macroscopic models is highly dependent on root density distribution albasha et al 2015 in addition to the soil physical parameters daisy hansen et al 2012 and dssat jones et al 2003 models use the exponential rwu model for simulating the root water uptake but the model parameters as well as their equations are different for different models li et al 2001 swap is a one dimensional physically based model which is used for simulating water heat and solute transport in saturated and unsaturated zones it has separate modules for irrigation management and crop growth wofost model van diepen et al 1989 swap provides the user with an option of choosing either linear or physically based root water uptake models kroes et al 2009 in this study water transport irrigation management and crop growth modules of swap were used swat soil and water assessment tool uses exponential root water uptake model defined in the epic documentation sharpley 1990 neitsch et al 2011 in which root density distribution is a bit simpler as compared to the one discussed by li et al 1998 and van lier et al 2008 swat has become a popular agro hydrological model amongst researchers and planners dealing with the simulation of hydrology agricultural water management and nutrient loads of agricultural watersheds around the world neitsch et al 2011 swat provides options for the implementation of scheduled irrigation and auto irrigation the latter can be triggered by soil water deficit or by plant water stress auto irrigation is commonly used due to the lack of scheduling data and it is recommended for the implementation of dynamic irrigation under climate variability or change even though swat is a widely used model it still has some shortcomings it has been continuously modified by researchers in the last decades in this study the authors focus on the subroutine which triggers irrigation under plant water stress for automatic irrigation scheduling there are very few studies that have explored the plant water stress subroutine in swat for simulating irrigation water demand for different crops under varying agro climatic conditions even though the improvement of the irrigation routines gained more attention in the last years santhi et al 2005 developed a canal irrigation component in swat and validated it for regional planning of an agricultural catchment in lower rio grande valley texas dechmi et al 2012 modified swat to correctly simulate the hydrological process in

growth algorithm is not suitable for simulating the representative cotton yield of the catchment which could be due to the limitation of auto irrigation function chen et al 2018 also found that although the swat default auto irrigation triggered by soil water content method provided a reasonable simulation of actual et the irrigation amount varied greatly from actual irrigation amount observed in the field they developed a new management allowable depletion mad based auto irrigation algorithm in swat based on scheduled date and accumulated heat units in most cases the irrigation amount simulated by swat default auto irrigation is overestimated compared to the observed values chen et al 2019 evaluated the swat mad algorithm using field irrigation data based on the fao 56 irrigation scheduling method for six corn fields in five states of the u s the results revealed that the irrigation amount simulated under soil water content auto irrigation algorithm was overestimated pbias of 32 9 at clovis site by the model whereas in case of plant water demand the model showed an underestimation of 36 uniyal et al 2019 found that the irrigation amount simulated by swat using plant water stress is sometimes 2 3 times less than the amount of irrigation simulated by the model under soil water deficit condition therefore there is a need to conduct studies which test the amount of irrigation simulated by the model as well as the overall crop yield and which propose further improvements in the auto irrigation routines of swat with this aim the objectives of the current research are framed as follows 1 improving auto irrigation in swat by changing the root density distribution 2 validating the proposed model with swap and observed data in terms of annual irrigation amount and crop yield at an experimental field hamerstorf lower saxony germany 3 evaluating the modified swat code at catchment scale by using models from the study of uniyal et al 2019 for baitarani india monsoon climate thubon vietnam tropical climate and wipperau germany humid climate 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data data from an experimental field fig 1 are used in this study to develop and test the different agro hydrological models at the field scale the experimental field is maintained by the agricultural chamber of the federal state of lower saxony in northern germany landwirtschaftskammer niedersachsen lwk lwk operates different experimental plots in hamerstorf within the ilmenau river catchment germany the average annual precipitation of the region was 756 mm from 2007 to 2018 which is distributed throughout the year humid climate weather data was obtained from deutscher wetterdienst dwd data analysis revealed that there is considerable variability between years 2009 and 2018 are hot and dry years compared to the average in terms of average annual maximum temperature 0 4 and 1 15 k and average annual solar radiation 7 and 34 in addition the amount of precipitation received by these two years was 30 40 less than the average precipitation during the cropping season of winter wheat from 2007 to 2018 also 2007 and 2017 were wet years which received 20 43 more precipitation than their respective average during 2007 2018 the soil in the experimental field is sandy loam with around 80 sand and 15 clay which makes it a relatively low water holding soil with high infiltration rates soil data was obtained by collecting the soil samples from the experimental field and soil textural analysis was performed in the lab to obtain the soil physical properties and to derive soil hydraulic parameters for the models the experimental site is used for consultancy purpose in niedersachsen region for providing irrigation recommendations to farmers on a weekly basis during the cropping season https www lwk niedersachsen de yearly reports about the experiments were obtained from lwk these provide information about planting harvesting fertilization and irrigation dates for different local crops grown in the experimental field corn silage csil sugar beet sgbt potato pota winter wheat wwht etc in addition to this amounts and scheduling of irrigation sprinkler and fertilizer for different crops grown in the experimental field from 2007 to 2018 were also provided in the reports soil s initial condition and information about the preceding crop were also given the experiments were done under different irrigation scenarios rain fed optimal and reduced irrigation which are also documented in the reports 2 2 model set up 2 2 1 design of the model experiment the physical processes are well defined in a small scale agricultural model as compared to the catchment scale agro hydrological model if adequate data is available as observed field data is available it was decided to first use a field scale model swap to mimic the field conditions and then head towards improving a catchment scale model swat by using both experimental data and model outputs of the physically based field scale model assuming that they are better and can be used to extend the observed data swap and swat were used in this study to simulate the annual irrigation amount as well as crop yield during 2007 2018 at the field scale the models were developed using the same weather and soil input for the simulation of the movement of water in the unsaturated soil swat uses a conceptual tipping bucket model whereas swap uses the physical richard s equation both swat and swap use a macroscopic approach to calculate the water uptake by roots mineral nitrogen and phosphorous amounts present in the field during 2007 were incorporated into swat chm file to depict the initial conditions for nitrogen and phosphorous in the soil profile whereas the swap model is initializing the nitrogen concentration from the previous model simulation the maximum rooting depth of the local soil was taken as 900 mm whereas actual rooting depth of winter wheat was taken 700 mm in swat crops were planted and harvested by using the planting and harvesting dates provided in the annual reports along with the date and amount of fertilizer application both use a temperature sum approach to grow crops but use different crop growth models two different irrigation management scenarios were considered 1 scheduled irrigation according to the field experiments and 2 auto irrigation in both the models however in case of automatic irrigation plant water stress was used for triggering the irrigation plant water stress is defined as the ratio of actual to the potential plant transpiration and for this study its value is taken as 0 95 the amount of irrigation water applied during an irrigation event was selected as the average amount of irrigation water applied in the field 25 mm during 2007 2018 irrigation efficiency was considered as 75 this includes the total loss that is due to transportation and application irrigation water is extracted from the shallow aquifer in the experimental field 2 2 2 swap in this study swap model version 4 0 1 was used to simulate the interaction of water and crop processes at field scale the model was simulated from 2006 to 2018 with 2006 being used as a warm up period in order to have reliable soil storage at the start of the simulation period van genuchten mualem parameters were calculated by using the pedotransfer function published by schaap et al 2001 a separate crop file for corn silage sugar beet potato and winter wheat was created using the parameters defined by groenendijk et al 2016 different swap models were created for different crops the amount of irrigation applied by the model as well as the corresponding yield of a specific crop was compared with the actual field values the selection of the swap model was done to check whether a field scale model can simulate the irrigation amount applied to an experimental field in addition to that observed irrigation and crop yield data for some additional crops of interest were not available in the experimental field swap was also used to fill the data gaps for swat therefore using a physically based model like swap would provide more data points to validate the existing as well as modified swat 2 2 3 swat swat version 2012 revision 664 was used in this study to simulate the soil water and plant interactions at catchment and field scale at first swat was developed for the whole wipperau basin fig 1 located in northern germany using land use weather soil and elevation data this is a sub catchment of the ilmenau river basin which shows soil and land management characteristics close to the hamerstorf experimental site it was chosen catchment scale simulations because streamflow of wipperau is less altered by anthropogenic influence than in the sub catchment where the experimental field is placed uniyal et al 2017 can be referred for more information about the catchment characteristics and the model development at catchment scale later a single hru combination of specific land use soil and slope model was analyzed for the experimental site using the input data from the experimental field like soil properties weather crop type irrigation and fertilizer amounts etc the simulation period was from 2005 to 2018 with the first three years as a warm up period more information about the basic model equations and its processes can be found in neitsch et al 2011 swat has two auto irrigation algorithms which vary with the stress identifier 1 plant water demand or 2 soil water deficit in case of plant water demand the model applies a dose of irrigation water on the day when the ratio of actual transpiration to potential transpiration becomes less than the user defined threshold for the soil water content irrigation scheduling method irrigation is triggered when the current water content in the soil profile falls below the field capacity minus the user defined soil water depletion threshold it was seen from the previous study uniyal et al 2019 that very less irrigation amount was simulated by swat for wwht avg 25 mm under plant water stress scheduling technique which is not comparable with the annual average irrigation amount applied in the experimental field avg 140 mm therefore winter wheat is used as a test crop to check the simulation of crop yield dry matter and irrigation amount for experimental field using swat and swap models and also the improvement in irrigation amount simulated by swat using the proposed modifications in this research 2 3 calibration and validation of swap and swat models calibration of both the models was performed using the observed yield of winter wheat during 2008 2013 while the rest of the years 2014 2018 were used for model validation as winter wheat is planted in fall 2007 and harvested in summer 2008 therefore the model comparison was performed from 2008 onwards different crop sensitive parameters were used to calibrate swap and swat under scheduled management practices irrigation and fertilization crop parameters in swap were sensitive towards extreme weather conditions in year 2017 wet and 2018 dry and hot compared to the average conditions during 2008 2016 therefore in this case swap was calibrated and validated in two different ways 1 using same parameters for all the years 2 using different parameters for 2017 and 2018 based on precipitation and temperature during the cropping season using winter wheat as the crop table 1 most of the parameters values were taken from the crop specific simulation parameters report for the european community boons prins et al 1993 the light use efficiency was set to 0 65 as in both the years 2017 and 2018 more water was present in the field due to rain or irrigation which reduced the nitrogen concentration available to plant therefore optimal nitrogen concentration ratio frnx was reduced from 0 4 to 0 35 in addition the temperature sum from emergence to anthesis tsumea was taken 750 in 2017 and 1300 in 2018 as the average temperature was less in 2017 compared to 2018 2 4 modification of swat for auto irrigation it was seen from this study that the irrigation amount simulated by the model under plant water stress condition is less compared to the actual amount of water applied to the experimental field however the amount of water applied in the experimental field is close to the irrigation amount simulated by swat under soil water deficit irrigation scheduling method this was further discussed in detail by uniyal et al 2019 therefore it is very important to diagnose the amount of water stress simulated by the model under plant water stress irrigation scheduling the water stress factor wstrs used in this method is the ratio of actual root water uptake up to the potential transpiration ep the irrigation trigger mechanism depends on the actual plant need actual transpiration and potential transpiration swat assumes actual transpiration as equal to the root water uptake the amount of irrigation simulated by the model completely depends on the stress factor therefore by using eq 1 it can be generalized as follows 1 irr f up ep potential transpiration ep is calculated by using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 on the other hand the root water uptake is calculated by using the plant growth module from the epic model sharpley 1990 this can be further improved by modifying the module the existing exponential equation used in the model for calculating the potential root water uptake is defined as follows 2 u p l e p i 1 exp λ 1 exp λ z l r z 1 e p c o 1 exp λ z l 1 r z e p c o k 1 l 1 u k where u p l is the potential root water uptake from layer l mm d e p i is potential transpiration mm d λ is the water use distribution parameter epco is plant uptake compensation factor z l is the current rooting depth mm and rz is the maximum rooting depth mm the irrigation simulated by the model can be improved 1 by calibration 2 modifying the code 1 the existing swat model can be calibrated for two important parameters λ and epco which control the actual root water uptake epco s default value is 0 95 the water distribution parameter λ depends on the soil characteristics its high value denotes high water uptake near the surface and very low water uptake in the lower half of the root zone by default this value is set to 10 which means the roots extract a high amount of water from the near surface to fulfill the transpiration demand of the plant calibration can only be done if the observed irrigation amount is known otherwise it will be difficult to calibrate the parameters at first the models were calibrated for winter wheat using the field observed schedules of irrigation and fertilizer later on the developed models were simulated using the auto irrigation under plant water stress condition and then the simulated irrigation from swap and swat was validated with the experimental irrigation amounts 2 modifications of swat are developed and validated based on the data of the experimental field as described below later on the modified model can be used to simulate irrigation amounts with higher confidence in the catchments where observed irrigation amounts are unknown rwu depends primarily on root density distribution and soil physical properties therefore in this case root density distribution and dynamic estimation of the plant uptake compensation factor is incorporated into the modified swat called swat m in this paper 2 4 1 root density distribution the existing mathematical description of root density distribution eq 3 can be replaced by an equation eq 4 defined by li et al 1998 to improve the simulated irrigation amount the new equation is an enhanced version of the existing equation and the parameters involved in this equation are all readily available in the model database the root water extraction models using the enhanced root density distribution function performed better than other models in some studies li et al 1998 2001 3 r o o t d e n s i t y d i s t r i b u t i o n 1 1 exp λ 1 exp λ z l r z 4 r o o t d e n s i t y d i s t r i b u t i o n ln 1 exp b z 1 1 exp b z 2 0 5 exp b z 1 exp b z 2 ln 2 1 exp b r z 0 5 1 exp b r z where z1 and z2 are the depths up to which the root water extraction has to be calculated b is the extinction coefficient which governs the percentage of root water supplied by the top 10 of the root zone 2 4 2 dynamic estimation of plant water uptake compensation factor the epco a root growth stress factor depends on different stress factors namely soil strength temperature and aluminum toxicity the aforementioned stresses depend on soil properties the lowest of these three stresses governs epco sharpley 1990 in this study two stresses are considered for estimating the dynamic value for epco namely soil stress ssl and temperature stress tmprs due to the lack of basic data required to calculate the stress due to aluminum toxicity for the experimental field and with no information regarding aluminum toxicity the authors have not considered this stress in the study area the equations used for calculating the soil strength stress factor are as follows 5 s s l 0 1 0 9 b d l b d l exp b t 1 b t 2 b d l this stress mainly depends upon bulk density texture field capacity and soil water content eavis 1972 monteith and banath 1965 taylor et al 1966 sharpley 1990 where ssl is the soil strength factor in layer l bd is the wet bulk density of soil t m3 bt1 and bt2 are the parameters that dependson soil texture there are specific equations to calculate the variables and parameters required for this equation which are discussed in detail in the epic manual sharpley 1990 additionally a new sub routine ssl is added to the code for calculating soil strength factor ssi furthermore the tmprs is calculated by using the code already present in swat neitsch et al 2011 arnold et al 2013 therefore 6 epco min ssl tmprs in addition a management scenario proposed by chen et al 2018 was also added to the model in this the whole plant growth cycle is divided into three stages initial 0 0 35 mid season 0 35 0 75 and late season 0 75 1 0 the ratio of accumulated heat units was used to define these crop stages in the model irrigation was triggered in the model based on different stresses defined for these stages chen et al 2018 in general the stress for the initial and the late season is assigned as 0 95 0 5 for the mid season stage 0 6 0 4 as a crop can withstand stress during this stage without much reduction in the yield allen et al 1998 this code is implemented hardcoded in the autoirr f module of the swat model rev664 2 4 3 irrigation scheme efficiency this section deals with the improvement in the implementation of application and conveyance efficiency in swat in the original version of swat rev664 source the irrigation amount simulated by the model during an irrigation event is calculated by subtracting the surface runoff loss during the process however in actual practice water is applied to the field first and after that the runoff losses occur during an irrigation event therefore the amount of water applied should be equal to the amount of water going into the soil plus the amount of water lost from the field due to surface runoff additionally the amount of water extracted from the source should be equal to the amount of water applied by the model during irrigation application water going into the soil plus the surface runoff divided by the application efficiency this includes losses during transportation as well as during application these corrections have been implemented into the irrigation f and autoirr f modules of the modified swat model later the swat m was used to simulate the irrigation amount and crop yield dry matter for the rest of the crops csil pota and sgbt the swat simulated results were then evaluated against the observed and swap simulated irrigation amount and crop yields using statistical indicators and box plots to validate the proposed modifications lastly swat m was applied to three different catchments to test the modified code at the catchment scale the effective parameters used for catchment scale models were derived from a most common parameter upscaling approach used in distributed hydrological modeling this approach assume that the processes equations and data from the smaller scale are also applicable at a larger scale it is assumed that the effective parameters from field plot scale when used for regional scale hydrological models would reproduce the mean response of the system observed at regional or catchment scale refsgaard et al 2016 this assumption was justified by refsgaard 1997 and henriksen et al 2003 whereas it was rejected by beven 1995 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance with scheduled irrigation this section comprises of the results comparing the simulated annual crop yield dry matter by swap and swat using field observed irrigation and fertilizer scheduling with a observed yield from the experimental field at hamerstorf obs field and b agricultural census data for the uelzen region census ulz during 2008 2018 fig 2 shows the observed and simulated yield of winter wheat under given irrigation and fertilizer amounts census ulz is the agricultural census data of the federal state of lower saxony which is reported by the farmers via an online platform due to a wide range of soil fertility and the presence of rain fed agriculture the larger scale yield is expected to be lower than the one on the highly managed experimental field swap c1 is the calibrated yield simulated by using same crop parameters for the entire period of interest whereas swap c2 uses different crop parameters for 2017 and 2018 as they were extreme years calibration results of wwht simulated by swap revealed 7 2 underestimation for both swap c1 and swap c2 whereas validation results were better in case of swap c2 3 31 compared to swap c1 pbias 38 2 this is due to the fact that swap is not able to simulate crop yield in two extreme years to a satisfactory level 2017 and 2018 this justifies the use of weather dependent crop parameters in swap as it is sensitive to temperature e g the model performance in swap c2 is improved compared to the swap c1 in terms of overall variability in addition swat model is also under estimating the model performance during both calibration and validation period with pbias 3 3 and 13 8 respectively it can be inferred from fig 2 that the simulated yields from both the models are not able to match the overall spread of wwht from the observed yield compared to the long term mean this qualitative analysis is also supported by the quantitative analysis which revealed the underestimation of simulated yield by 5 64 and 6 15 from swap and swat during 2008 2018 respectively furthermore the simulated wwht yield from swat and swap matches well with census ulz in terms of their overall spread and mean this is due to less uncertainty or averaging effects at district scale compared to field scale the overall underestimation in case of swat is attributed to some warm years 2015 and 2018 for which the considered model has bad model performance in simulating yield the overall deviation in winter wheat in these years is 15 29 whereas it is 3 19 in rest of the years in addition to this the overall difference in the long term means from both the models is close to 0 5 t ha compared to the long term average of the observed yield during 2008 2018 the model simulated yields and error ranges are backed by a study done in europe abbaspour et al 2015 it is obvious from the boxplots fig 2 that the variability of the observed yield from the experimental field is better represented by swap whereas swat represents the overall yield s distribution better for the regional census data of uelzen compared to the experimental field these results comply with the target scale of application of the two models used 3 2 model performance under auto irrigation fig 3 shows the range of annual irrigation simulated by models using plant water stress triggering under auto irrigation scheduling along with the observed irrigation amount applied in the field swat uc shows the irrigation amount simulated by swat model under default plant water stress auto irrigation condition without calibration of λ and epco in addition swat denotes the irrigation amount simulated after calibrating the model using λ 2 and epco 0 6 parameter whereas swat m shows the simulated irrigation from the modified swat model swat m uses a dynamic value of epco which is calculated internally by the model and also it doesn t use λ it can be seen from the results that the overall spread and mean is well replicated by swap as compared to both the swat cases the irrigation amount from swat and swat m is relatively good compared to observed and swap in simulating the mean annual irrigation amount than the one simulated by uncalibrated swat swat uc but still one can see a huge uncertainty in irrigation simulation in terms of higher annual variability and a general underestimation the one by one comparison of simulated irrigation from swap and swat revealed that the overall model response to an extreme dry year 2018 is not well represented in 2018 swap simulated 175 mm and swat models simulated irrigation values ranging from 250 to 350 mm whereas in 2017 which was a wet year all the models simulated either zero or 25 mm of irrigation which is close one can see a general overestimation in 2018 from all the different swat models e g even though the irrigation amount is zero in case of swat uc in all the years but still it has 125 mm of irrigation amount simulated in 2018 this reveals that there is more stress in swat in 2018 compared to other years specifically due to high observed temperature the statistical indicators pbias and correlation r are also used to evaluate the simulated irrigation amount it can be seen from the results that both the models are underestimating the irrigation amount swat by 34 and swap by 11 it should be noted that the one by one matching of observed and simulated irrigation is not possible therefore the bias from the field values is acceptable for simulated irrigation chen et al 2018 as well as crop yield abbaspour et al 2015 this can be justified by several reasons 1 the irrigation amount as applied in the experimental field was based on the combination of previous day s weather conditions along with the forecast of future weather and soil water deficit as well as the condition of the plant plant water stress 2 the irrigation amount applied in one irrigation event in both the models during an irrigation event is the same but in field conditions it varies from year to year and also varies within a year however based on the qualitative and quantitative analysis it can be inferred that simulated irrigation amount from swap swat and swat m is in a good range chen et al 2018 in addition fig 4 shows the year wise comparison of irrigation amounts simulated by swap and different swat models under plant water demand irrigation scheduling technique against the observed irrigation amounts applied in the field it can be seen from the figure that the overall response of observed and modified swat is better swat m compared to the irrigation amounts simulated by calibrated swat model swat however the overall variability is better matched in case of swap simulated irrigation amounts this might be due to the reason that swat sometimes irrigates out of season chen et al 2019 the higher amount can be related to more frequent triggering furthermore the observed amounts applied in the experimental field were restricted in extreme years like 2018 due to over use of water rights fig 5 shows the boxplot comparison of observed obs field and obs ulz and simulated swap swat and swat m wwht during 2008 2018 at hamerstorf in this the auto irrigation scheduling under plant water stress condition was used the overall distribution and crop yield are mostly reduced compared to the yield simulated in fig 2 it can be seen from fig 5 that the overall range of wwht yield simulated by different swat models is nearly the same it can be concluded from this result that water stress is not the dominant stress affecting the crop yield as the same crop parameters were used in two cases swat and swat m figs 2 and 5 the long term mean as well as pbias 6 2 8 8 and r 0 6 0 7 is in accordance with the observed yield of wwht at hamerstorf and the overall prediction uncertainty is less in model simulated results in addition the mean and median of simulated yield from all the models are close to the observed yield of winter wheat in the uelzen district 3 3 other crops evaluation of annual irrigation amount and yield simulated by swat m and swap for corn silage csil sugar beet sgbt and potato pota was also performed for the experimental field it should be noted that in the case of these crops same values of crop parameters were used for calibration and validation from 2008 to 2013 and 2014 2018 respectively fig 6 shows the boxplots of annual irrigation and yield dry matter from csil it is assessed from the boxplots that the mean annual irrigation simulated by swap 125 mm and swat m 75 mm are close to the observed mean 84 mm quantitative analysis revealed an overestimation of simulated irrigation in case of swap by 48 and underestimation in case of swat m by 11 the simulated yield from both the models is matching well with each other difference 0 17 as compared to the observed yield in addition their overall spread and mean is not matching well with the observed yield pbias 8 6 8 7 this could be attributed to the crop model parameters for csil apart from csil figs 7 8 show the comparative evaluation of simulated irrigation amount and crop yield for sgbt and pota respectively it can be seen from figs 7 8 that the simulated irrigation is underestimated in case of sgbt pbias 15 15 15 20 while it is overestimated in case of pota pbias 29 96 to 14 7 for both the crops the overall spread and annual average mean of simulated irrigation the amount is matching relatively well when compared to wwht and csil a general trend is observed in simulating crop yield using swap and swat m which revealed that the simulated yield is always underestimated for all the crops it should be noted that the mean and spread of crop yield from the uelzen district is less compared to hamerstorf figs 6 8 this is expected because not all fields in this region are irrigated and some soils show a poorer quality sandy soil compared to the one in the experimental field loamy sand in case of all crops the overall spread simulated by swap and swat m is covering the observed yield estimated from the uelzen district 3 4 verification of swat m at the catchment scale the swat m was tested for three different catchments with different agroclimatic conditions namely baitarani thubon and wipperau fig 1 fig 9 shows the annual average irrigation amount simulated for the wipperau catchment during 2007 2018 for different crops here obs field is the observed irrigation applied in hamerstorf field given for comparison purpose swat p is the irrigation amount simulated by swat under plant water stress auto irrigation setting whereas swat m is the simulated irrigation amount using the swat m during auto irrigation swat s and swat s m are the irrigation amounts simulated by original and modified swat under soil water deficit auto irrigation setting this is given to check if there is any feedback between the modifications with the soil moisture deficit auto irrigation routine the boxplots from swat s and swat s m show that less irrigation is applied with the new code this difference can be explained by the difference in et 2 due to the changes of the root density distribution this has effect on the transpiration calculated by the model and thus on soil moisture and the triggering of auto irrigation the overall difference reduction in mean annual irrigation in case of swat s m varies from 9 to 10 compared to swat s the overall irrigation amount in case of csil sgbt and wwht have significantly increased as compared to the one simulated by swat p model furthermore simulated irrigation amount for pota is more in case of swat p and swat m compared to the ones applied in the field but the overall spread is less than the amount applied in the field here obs field is used as a reference as there is no other observed data for the whole wipperau catchment it can be assessed from the results that although obs field cannot be directly compared with swat p and swat m but its overall spread and mean will provide useful insight to evaluate the modified swat fig 10 shows the annual average irrigation amounts simulated under plant water stress swat p and soil water deficit swat s irrigation along with the modified swat swat m under plant water stress irrigation scheduling condition for baitarani and thubon catchments during 2000 2010 as the observed irrigation amounts are not available in these catchments therefore irrigation amounts simulated by model under soil water deficit condition swat s is assumed to be close to the local conditions of the catchments by comparing the simulated irrigation amounts with the literature and expert opinions in addition the results reveal a clear improvement in terms of the annual average mean of irrigation amounts simulated using swat m and swat s models as more water is applied in case of swat m therefore it is expected that it will affect et because more water is available for the plant to transpire the results showed a slight increase in catchment s et varying from 0 10 wipperau to 1 10 baitarni and increase in total aquifer recharge from 1 25 thubon to 9 57 wipperau 4 conclusions irrigation scheduling methods help to improve the simulation of irrigation water demand by agro hydrological models the current study modified the swat code in improving the irrigation water demand simulated using plant water stress during 2007 2018 for an experimental site hamerstorf in lower saxony germany a field scale model swap was also used to simulate the irrigation amount and the crop yield from this experimental field swap and swat were calibrated for simulating crop yield of corn silage sugar beet potato and winter wheat the results revealed that the calibrated models were able to simulate the annual irrigation amount and crop yield with acceptable bias however there is uncertainty in model parameters during calibration the proposed modification revealed that root density distribution and dynamic compensation factor play an important role in quantifying the plant water stress in the model during auto irrigation mode it can be seen from the modified swat model that root density distribution soil strength and temperature are affecting the actual root water uptake the verification of the modified swat model at catchment scale was performed it can be concluded from the results that the overall simulation of irrigation amount was improved with only minor impact on the simulated annual yield of different crops catchment s annual average et and total aquifer recharge in general this study has provided a good insight into the process affecting auto irrigation in the case of plant water stress condition in addition there is minor effect of the modified code on the soil water deficit irrigation scheduling method therefore the findings of this study will help researchers to get more consistent irrigation amounts simulated by swat auto irrigation scheduling techniques and thus reduce the uncertainties associated with the simulation of irrigation water demand by swat in particular when observed values are not available as it is the case for climate change predictions it can be seen from the results that improvement can be done in the plant growth modules used by both the models in addition the use of non stationary crop parameters is encouraged as swap was not able to simulate crop yield in extreme years both the models show good capabilities of mimicking the past and current irrigation amounts but they are limited in terms of operational predictions as the weather of the season is not known a priori this limitation can be overcome by using model parameter ensembles or by updating the model once the seasonal weather characteristics becomes clear follow up studies could be done to combine the swat subroutines modified by different authors to build new irrigation routines for the next generation of swat code e g chen et al 2018 for irrigation soil water deficit scheduling under management allowed depletion the current model distributes the same amount of water to the entire hru area however this is not true in actual practice therefore aspects such as model code modifications for applying non uniform distribution of irrigation water can be part of future research in addition aluminum toxicity could be incorporated in the model which authors have neglected for this study future research in irrigation simulation should implement model parameter uncertainty analyses for hydrological models in addition to that the model uncertainty can be dealt with using the model ensemble for simulating irrigation amounts at field and catchment scale acknowledgments the authors would like to thank ms angela riedel and mr ekkehard fricke from landwirtschaftskammer niedersachsen and fachverband feldberegnung e v for providing the necessary field information and data for carrying out this research in addition we would like to thank mr christian themer and ms surbhi jain for initially developing a swap model in their m sc theses which helped us to further develop it according to our requirement 
10927,automatic irrigation in the soil and water assessment tool swat is triggered by using plant water stress and soil water deficit irrigation scheduling auto irrigation is important to simulate the catchment s behavior in response to climate change and water management scenarios however studies have identified deficiencies in the auto irrigation algorithms in swat as the irrigation water amount simulated under plant water stress scheduling shows a large deviation from the simulated irrigation water amount under soil water deficit scheduling therefore the current research deals with validating and modifying the auto irrigation scheduling under plant water stress condition using swat the modified swat model was evaluated against the soil water atmosphere plant swap model as well as observed data for irrigation and crop yield at an experimental field hamerstorf lower saxony germany during the 2008 2018 cropping seasons the two swat subroutines swu and autoirr were modified the existing root density distribution function was replaced with the one proposed by li et al 1998 and also a dynamic estimation of the plant water uptake compensation factor epco was incorporated into the modified swat the results revealed that swap and modified swat were able to simulate the irrigation amount and crop yield with an acceptable bias for all the crops at the experimental site however the overall spread of crop yield simulated 11 years by both the models was less compared to the observed spread for most of the crops furthermore the modified swat code was used to simulate the irrigation amount for three different agro climatic catchments in germany india and vietnam results showed improved irrigation simulation in terms of long term annual amounts compared to the default swat under plant water stress condition keywords root water uptake irrigation auto irrigation swat swap 1 introduction plant water uptake plays a main role in water transfer in the soil plant and atmosphere continuum feddes et al 2001 it is estimated that 65 of the precipitation is returned to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration et which depends on plant water uptake oki and kanae 2006 water availability enhances the plant water uptake processes in irrigated agricultural fields irrigated agriculture provides an enormous contribution to global food supply and security by producing approximately 40 of food and agricultural commodities on only 20 of the agricultural area kadiresan and khanal 2018 hence the quality of simulations in agricultural water management depends on a good implementation of root water uptake albasha et al 2015 water availability and water demand are two important aspects of sustainable water resources management the increase in water scarcity due to the overuse of limited water resources is a real threat to sustainable water resources development in many parts of the world irrigated agriculture is the most relevant consumer of water worldwide population growth and climate change will most probably lead to further increasing irrigation water demand elliott et al 2014 as water is a highly managed commodity in irrigation systems therefore improving the simulation of root water uptake rwu in agro hydrological models will foster improvements in resource utilization at global regional and field scales research on rwu has resulted in the development of models that vary from conceptual to highly complex physically based models feddes 1982 described one dimensional water flow in a heterogeneous soil root system in which the sink term was integrated over the plant s rooting depth this model was later improved by peters et al 2017 who extended its application to limited aeration and under low water potential conditions jarvis 1989 described root water uptake as a function of potential et and a weighted stress index which depends on vertical root distribution and water content in the soil li et al 1998 developed an exponential root water extraction function to account for non uniform root distribution in the soil profile and this was implemented into the soil water plant atmosphere swap model jarvis 2011 developed a parsimonious physically based uptake compensation model that requires fewer parameters than the other empirical approaches peters 2016 introduced a constraint to compensate for too high transpiration rates in the empirical model developed by jarvis 2011 even though the number of parameters used in the aforementioned models is low their correct estimation is important for simulating root water uptake de willigen et al 2012 evaluated root water uptake from three soil water flow models of different complexity and revealed that soil physical and root physiological factors are important for root water uptake modeling ojha et al 2009 examined the performance of different root water extraction models using available data as well as data generated under controlled conditions the result stresses that the nonlinear parameters in the model can define the nonlinearity in plant water uptake van lier et al 2008 developed a physically based root water uptake model containing a compensation mechanism based on the matric flux potential m and different root parameters the proposed reduction function was built into the swap model and predictions were compared to the feddes model results revealed that the developed function can simulate the compensated root water uptake without increasing the number of input parameters or degrading model performance even though rwu is a very small component of the water cycle but it affects one of the most important losses occurring in the system evapotranspiration et and this makes it sensitive towards the water cycle in addition this is a highly complicated and heterogeneous process occurring inside the soil macroscopic empirical rwu models are often used in hydrological studies to predict water dynamics through the soil plant atmosphere continuum they have an edge over the other models as they do not require complete insight into the physical processes of root water uptake thereby eliminating the need for parameters that are difficult to obtain ojha et al 2009 it can be assessed from the literature that rwu in macroscopic models is highly dependent on root density distribution albasha et al 2015 in addition to the soil physical parameters daisy hansen et al 2012 and dssat jones et al 2003 models use the exponential rwu model for simulating the root water uptake but the model parameters as well as their equations are different for different models li et al 2001 swap is a one dimensional physically based model which is used for simulating water heat and solute transport in saturated and unsaturated zones it has separate modules for irrigation management and crop growth wofost model van diepen et al 1989 swap provides the user with an option of choosing either linear or physically based root water uptake models kroes et al 2009 in this study water transport irrigation management and crop growth modules of swap were used swat soil and water assessment tool uses exponential root water uptake model defined in the epic documentation sharpley 1990 neitsch et al 2011 in which root density distribution is a bit simpler as compared to the one discussed by li et al 1998 and van lier et al 2008 swat has become a popular agro hydrological model amongst researchers and planners dealing with the simulation of hydrology agricultural water management and nutrient loads of agricultural watersheds around the world neitsch et al 2011 swat provides options for the implementation of scheduled irrigation and auto irrigation the latter can be triggered by soil water deficit or by plant water stress auto irrigation is commonly used due to the lack of scheduling data and it is recommended for the implementation of dynamic irrigation under climate variability or change even though swat is a widely used model it still has some shortcomings it has been continuously modified by researchers in the last decades in this study the authors focus on the subroutine which triggers irrigation under plant water stress for automatic irrigation scheduling there are very few studies that have explored the plant water stress subroutine in swat for simulating irrigation water demand for different crops under varying agro climatic conditions even though the improvement of the irrigation routines gained more attention in the last years santhi et al 2005 developed a canal irrigation component in swat and validated it for regional planning of an agricultural catchment in lower rio grande valley texas dechmi et al 2012 modified swat to correctly simulate the hydrological process in an intensively irrigated catchment located in spain panagopoulos et al 2014 assessed the cost effectiveness of different irrigation water management practices in a water scarce agricultural catchment in pinios greece githui et al 2016 tested different irrigation inputs in swat and evaluated them against the observed and simulated flow and et in an irrigated catchment in australia wei et al 2018 modified seepage simulation from earthen irrigation systems to improve the simulation of management practices and hydrological processes mainly in stream flows in an intensively managed agricultural watershed in colorado united states mcinerney et al 2018 evaluated the response of different spatio temporal irrigation inputs in simulating streamflow et and potential recharge marek et al 2017 used swat for simulating the crop yields crop water use as well as the irrigation required by a semi arid watershed located in the texas high plains us the overall results concluded that swat s plant growth algorithm is not suitable for simulating the representative cotton yield of the catchment which could be due to the limitation of auto irrigation function chen et al 2018 also found that although the swat default auto irrigation triggered by soil water content method provided a reasonable simulation of actual et the irrigation amount varied greatly from actual irrigation amount observed in the field they developed a new management allowable depletion mad based auto irrigation algorithm in swat based on scheduled date and accumulated heat units in most cases the irrigation amount simulated by swat default auto irrigation is overestimated compared to the observed values chen et al 2019 evaluated the swat mad algorithm using field irrigation data based on the fao 56 irrigation scheduling method for six corn fields in five states of the u s the results revealed that the irrigation amount simulated under soil water content auto irrigation algorithm was overestimated pbias of 32 9 at clovis site by the model whereas in case of plant water demand the model showed an underestimation of 36 uniyal et al 2019 found that the irrigation amount simulated by swat using plant water stress is sometimes 2 3 times less than the amount of irrigation simulated by the model under soil water deficit condition therefore there is a need to conduct studies which test the amount of irrigation simulated by the model as well as the overall crop yield and which propose further improvements in the auto irrigation routines of swat with this aim the objectives of the current research are framed as follows 1 improving auto irrigation in swat by changing the root density distribution 2 validating the proposed model with swap and observed data in terms of annual irrigation amount and crop yield at an experimental field hamerstorf lower saxony germany 3 evaluating the modified swat code at catchment scale by using models from the study of uniyal et al 2019 for baitarani india monsoon climate thubon vietnam tropical climate and wipperau germany humid climate 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data data from an experimental field fig 1 are used in this study to develop and test the different agro hydrological models at the field scale the experimental field is maintained by the agricultural chamber of the federal state of lower saxony in northern germany landwirtschaftskammer niedersachsen lwk lwk operates different experimental plots in hamerstorf within the ilmenau river catchment germany the average annual precipitation of the region was 756 mm from 2007 to 2018 which is distributed throughout the year humid climate weather data was obtained from deutscher wetterdienst dwd data analysis revealed that there is considerable variability between years 2009 and 2018 are hot and dry years compared to the average in terms of average annual maximum temperature 0 4 and 1 15 k and average annual solar radiation 7 and 34 in addition the amount of precipitation received by these two years was 30 40 less than the average precipitation during the cropping season of winter wheat from 2007 to 2018 also 2007 and 2017 were wet years which received 20 43 more precipitation than their respective average during 2007 2018 the soil in the experimental field is sandy loam with around 80 sand and 15 clay which makes it a relatively low water holding soil with high infiltration rates soil data was obtained by collecting the soil samples from the experimental field and soil textural analysis was performed in the lab to obtain the soil physical properties and to derive soil hydraulic parameters for the models the experimental site is used for consultancy purpose in niedersachsen region for providing irrigation recommendations to farmers on a weekly basis during the cropping season https www lwk niedersachsen de yearly reports about the experiments were obtained from lwk these provide information about planting harvesting fertilization and irrigation dates for different local crops grown in the experimental field corn silage csil sugar beet sgbt potato pota winter wheat wwht etc in addition to this amounts and scheduling of irrigation sprinkler and fertilizer for different crops grown in the experimental field from 2007 to 2018 were also provided in the reports soil s initial condition and information about the preceding crop were also given the experiments were done under different irrigation scenarios rain fed optimal and reduced irrigation which are also documented in the reports 2 2 model set up 2 2 1 design of the model experiment the physical processes are well defined in a small scale agricultural model as compared to the catchment scale agro hydrological model if adequate data is available as observed field data is available it was decided to first use a field scale model swap to mimic the field conditions and then head towards improving a catchment scale model swat by using both experimental data and model outputs of the physically based field scale model assuming that they are better and can be used to extend the observed data swap and swat were used in this study to simulate the annual irrigation amount as well as crop yield during 2007 2018 at the field scale the models were developed using the same weather and soil input for the simulation of the movement of water in the unsaturated soil swat uses a conceptual tipping bucket model whereas swap uses the physical richard s equation both swat and swap use a macroscopic approach to calculate the water uptake by roots mineral nitrogen and phosphorous amounts present in the field during 2007 were incorporated into swat chm file to depict the initial conditions for nitrogen and phosphorous in the soil profile whereas the swap model is initializing the nitrogen concentration from the previous model simulation the maximum rooting depth of the local soil was taken as 900 mm whereas actual rooting depth of winter wheat was taken 700 mm in swat crops were planted and harvested by using the planting and harvesting dates provided in the annual reports along with the date and amount of fertilizer application both use a temperature sum approach to grow crops but use different crop growth models two different irrigation management scenarios were considered 1 scheduled irrigation according to the field experiments and 2 auto irrigation in both the models however in case of automatic irrigation plant water stress was used for triggering the irrigation plant water stress is defined as the ratio of actual to the potential plant transpiration and for this study its value is taken as 0 95 the amount of irrigation water applied during an irrigation event was selected as the average amount of irrigation water applied in the field 25 mm during 2007 2018 irrigation efficiency was considered as 75 this includes the total loss that is due to transportation and application irrigation water is extracted from the shallow aquifer in the experimental field 2 2 2 swap in this study swap model version 4 0 1 was used to simulate the interaction of water and crop processes at field scale the model was simulated from 2006 to 2018 with 2006 being used as a warm up period in order to have reliable soil storage at the start of the simulation period van genuchten mualem parameters were calculated by using the pedotransfer function published by schaap et al 2001 a separate crop file for corn silage sugar beet potato and winter wheat was created using the parameters defined by groenendijk et al 2016 different swap models were created for different crops the amount of irrigation applied by the model as well as the corresponding yield of a specific crop was compared with the actual field values the selection of the swap model was done to check whether a field scale model can simulate the irrigation amount applied to an experimental field in addition to that observed irrigation and crop yield data for some additional crops of interest were not available in the experimental field swap was also used to fill the data gaps for swat therefore using a physically based model like swap would provide more data points to validate the existing as well as modified swat 2 2 3 swat swat version 2012 revision 664 was used in this study to simulate the soil water and plant interactions at catchment and field scale at first swat was developed for the whole wipperau basin fig 1 located in northern germany using land use weather soil and elevation data this is a sub catchment of the ilmenau river basin which shows soil and land management characteristics close to the hamerstorf experimental site it was chosen catchment scale simulations because streamflow of wipperau is less altered by anthropogenic influence than in the sub catchment where the experimental field is placed uniyal et al 2017 can be referred for more information about the catchment characteristics and the model development at catchment scale later a single hru combination of specific land use soil and slope model was analyzed for the experimental site using the input data from the experimental field like soil properties weather crop type irrigation and fertilizer amounts etc the simulation period was from 2005 to 2018 with the first three years as a warm up period more information about the basic model equations and its processes can be found in neitsch et al 2011 swat has two auto irrigation algorithms which vary with the stress identifier 1 plant water demand or 2 soil water deficit in case of plant water demand the model applies a dose of irrigation water on the day when the ratio of actual transpiration to potential transpiration becomes less than the user defined threshold for the soil water content irrigation scheduling method irrigation is triggered when the current water content in the soil profile falls below the field capacity minus the user defined soil water depletion threshold it was seen from the previous study uniyal et al 2019 that very less irrigation amount was simulated by swat for wwht avg 25 mm under plant water stress scheduling technique which is not comparable with the annual average irrigation amount applied in the experimental field avg 140 mm therefore winter wheat is used as a test crop to check the simulation of crop yield dry matter and irrigation amount for experimental field using swat and swap models and also the improvement in irrigation amount simulated by swat using the proposed modifications in this research 2 3 calibration and validation of swap and swat models calibration of both the models was performed using the observed yield of winter wheat during 2008 2013 while the rest of the years 2014 2018 were used for model validation as winter wheat is planted in fall 2007 and harvested in summer 2008 therefore the model comparison was performed from 2008 onwards different crop sensitive parameters were used to calibrate swap and swat under scheduled management practices irrigation and fertilization crop parameters in swap were sensitive towards extreme weather conditions in year 2017 wet and 2018 dry and hot compared to the average conditions during 2008 2016 therefore in this case swap was calibrated and validated in two different ways 1 using same parameters for all the years 2 using different parameters for 2017 and 2018 based on precipitation and temperature during the cropping season using winter wheat as the crop table 1 most of the parameters values were taken from the crop specific simulation parameters report for the european community boons prins et al 1993 the light use efficiency was set to 0 65 as in both the years 2017 and 2018 more water was present in the field due to rain or irrigation which reduced the nitrogen concentration available to plant therefore optimal nitrogen concentration ratio frnx was reduced from 0 4 to 0 35 in addition the temperature sum from emergence to anthesis tsumea was taken 750 in 2017 and 1300 in 2018 as the average temperature was less in 2017 compared to 2018 2 4 modification of swat for auto irrigation it was seen from this study that the irrigation amount simulated by the model under plant water stress condition is less compared to the actual amount of water applied to the experimental field however the amount of water applied in the experimental field is close to the irrigation amount simulated by swat under soil water deficit irrigation scheduling method this was further discussed in detail by uniyal et al 2019 therefore it is very important to diagnose the amount of water stress simulated by the model under plant water stress irrigation scheduling the water stress factor wstrs used in this method is the ratio of actual root water uptake up to the potential transpiration ep the irrigation trigger mechanism depends on the actual plant need actual transpiration and potential transpiration swat assumes actual transpiration as equal to the root water uptake the amount of irrigation simulated by the model completely depends on the stress factor therefore by using eq 1 it can be generalized as follows 1 irr f up ep potential transpiration ep is calculated by using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 on the other hand the root water uptake is calculated by using the plant growth module from the epic model sharpley 1990 this can be further improved by modifying the module the existing exponential equation used in the model for calculating the potential root water uptake is defined as follows 2 u p l e p i 1 exp λ 1 exp λ z l r z 1 e p c o 1 exp λ z l 1 r z e p c o k 1 l 1 u k where u p l is the potential root water uptake from layer l mm d e p i is potential transpiration mm d λ is the water use distribution parameter epco is plant uptake compensation factor z l is the current rooting depth mm and rz is the maximum rooting depth mm the irrigation simulated by the model can be improved 1 by calibration 2 modifying the code 1 the existing swat model can be calibrated for two important parameters λ and epco which control the actual root water uptake epco s default value is 0 95 the water distribution parameter λ depends on the soil characteristics its high value denotes high water uptake near the surface and very low water uptake in the lower half of the root zone by default this value is set to 10 which means the roots extract a high amount of water from the near surface to fulfill the transpiration demand of the plant calibration can only be done if the observed irrigation amount is known otherwise it will be difficult to calibrate the parameters at first the models were calibrated for winter wheat using the field observed schedules of irrigation and fertilizer later on the developed models were simulated using the auto irrigation under plant water stress condition and then the simulated irrigation from swap and swat was validated with the experimental irrigation amounts 2 modifications of swat are developed and validated based on the data of the experimental field as described below later on the modified model can be used to simulate irrigation amounts with higher confidence in the catchments where observed irrigation amounts are unknown rwu depends primarily on root density distribution and soil physical properties therefore in this case root density distribution and dynamic estimation of the plant uptake compensation factor is incorporated into the modified swat called swat m in this paper 2 4 1 root density distribution the existing mathematical description of root density distribution eq 3 can be replaced by an equation eq 4 defined by li et al 1998 to improve the simulated irrigation amount the new equation is an enhanced version of the existing equation and the parameters involved in this equation are all readily available in the model database the root water extraction models using the enhanced root density distribution function performed better than other models in some studies li et al 1998 2001 3 r o o t d e n s i t y d i s t r i b u t i o n 1 1 exp λ 1 exp λ z l r z 4 r o o t d e n s i t y d i s t r i b u t i o n ln 1 exp b z 1 1 exp b z 2 0 5 exp b z 1 exp b z 2 ln 2 1 exp b r z 0 5 1 exp b r z where z1 and z2 are the depths up to which the root water extraction has to be calculated b is the extinction coefficient which governs the percentage of root water supplied by the top 10 of the root zone 2 4 2 dynamic estimation of plant water uptake compensation factor the epco a root growth stress factor depends on different stress factors namely soil strength temperature and aluminum toxicity the aforementioned stresses depend on soil properties the lowest of these three stresses governs epco sharpley 1990 in this study two stresses are considered for estimating the dynamic value for epco namely soil stress ssl and temperature stress tmprs due to the lack of basic data required to calculate the stress due to aluminum toxicity for the experimental field and with no information regarding aluminum toxicity the authors have not considered this stress in the study area the equations used for calculating the soil strength stress factor are as follows 5 s s l 0 1 0 9 b d l b d l exp b t 1 b t 2 b d l this stress mainly depends upon bulk density texture field capacity and soil water content eavis 1972 monteith and banath 1965 taylor et al 1966 sharpley 1990 where ssl is the soil strength factor in layer l bd is the wet bulk density of soil t m3 bt1 and bt2 are the parameters that dependson soil texture there are specific equations to calculate the variables and parameters required for this equation which are discussed in detail in the epic manual sharpley 1990 additionally a new sub routine ssl is added to the code for calculating soil strength factor ssi furthermore the tmprs is calculated by using the code already present in swat neitsch et al 2011 arnold et al 2013 therefore 6 epco min ssl tmprs in addition a management scenario proposed by chen et al 2018 was also added to the model in this the whole plant growth cycle is divided into three stages initial 0 0 35 mid season 0 35 0 75 and late season 0 75 1 0 the ratio of accumulated heat units was used to define these crop stages in the model irrigation was triggered in the model based on different stresses defined for these stages chen et al 2018 in general the stress for the initial and the late season is assigned as 0 95 0 5 for the mid season stage 0 6 0 4 as a crop can withstand stress during this stage without much reduction in the yield allen et al 1998 this code is implemented hardcoded in the autoirr f module of the swat model rev664 2 4 3 irrigation scheme efficiency this section deals with the improvement in the implementation of application and conveyance efficiency in swat in the original version of swat rev664 source the irrigation amount simulated by the model during an irrigation event is calculated by subtracting the surface runoff loss during the process however in actual practice water is applied to the field first and after that the runoff losses occur during an irrigation event therefore the amount of water applied should be equal to the amount of water going into the soil plus the amount of water lost from the field due to surface runoff additionally the amount of water extracted from the source should be equal to the amount of water applied by the model during irrigation application water going into the soil plus the surface runoff divided by the application efficiency this includes losses during transportation as well as during application these corrections have been implemented into the irrigation f and autoirr f modules of the modified swat model later the swat m was used to simulate the irrigation amount and crop yield dry matter for the rest of the crops csil pota and sgbt the swat simulated results were then evaluated against the observed and swap simulated irrigation amount and crop yields using statistical indicators and box plots to validate the proposed modifications lastly swat m was applied to three different catchments to test the modified code at the catchment scale the effective parameters used for catchment scale models were derived from a most common parameter upscaling approach used in distributed hydrological modeling this approach assume that the processes equations and data from the smaller scale are also applicable at a larger scale it is assumed that the effective parameters from field plot scale when used for regional scale hydrological models would reproduce the mean response of the system observed at regional or catchment scale refsgaard et al 2016 this assumption was justified by refsgaard 1997 and henriksen et al 2003 whereas it was rejected by beven 1995 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance with scheduled irrigation this section comprises of the results comparing the simulated annual crop yield dry matter by swap and swat using field observed irrigation and fertilizer scheduling with a observed yield from the experimental field at hamerstorf obs field and b agricultural census data for the uelzen region census ulz during 2008 2018 fig 2 shows the observed and simulated yield of winter wheat under given irrigation and fertilizer amounts census ulz is the agricultural census data of the federal state of lower saxony which is reported by the farmers via an online platform due to a wide range of soil fertility and the presence of rain fed agriculture the larger scale yield is expected to be lower than the one on the highly managed experimental field swap c1 is the calibrated yield simulated by using same crop parameters for the entire period of interest whereas swap c2 uses different crop parameters for 2017 and 2018 as they were extreme years calibration results of wwht simulated by swap revealed 7 2 underestimation for both swap c1 and swap c2 whereas validation results were better in case of swap c2 3 31 compared to swap c1 pbias 38 2 this is due to the fact that swap is not able to simulate crop yield in two extreme years to a satisfactory level 2017 and 2018 this justifies the use of weather dependent crop parameters in swap as it is sensitive to temperature e g the model performance in swap c2 is improved compared to the swap c1 in terms of overall variability in addition swat model is also under estimating the model performance during both calibration and validation period with pbias 3 3 and 13 8 respectively it can be inferred from fig 2 that the simulated yields from both the models are not able to match the overall spread of wwht from the observed yield compared to the long term mean this qualitative analysis is also supported by the quantitative analysis which revealed the underestimation of simulated yield by 5 64 and 6 15 from swap and swat during 2008 2018 respectively furthermore the simulated wwht yield from swat and swap matches well with census ulz in terms of their overall spread and mean this is due to less uncertainty or averaging effects at district scale compared to field scale the overall underestimation in case of swat is attributed to some warm years 2015 and 2018 for which the considered model has bad model performance in simulating yield the overall deviation in winter wheat in these years is 15 29 whereas it is 3 19 in rest of the years in addition to this the overall difference in the long term means from both the models is close to 0 5 t ha compared to the long term average of the observed yield during 2008 2018 the model simulated yields and error ranges are backed by a study done in europe abbaspour et al 2015 it is obvious from the boxplots fig 2 that the variability of the observed yield from the experimental field is better represented by swap whereas swat represents the overall yield s distribution better for the regional census data of uelzen compared to the experimental field these results comply with the target scale of application of the two models used 3 2 model performance under auto irrigation fig 3 shows the range of annual irrigation simulated by models using plant water stress triggering under auto irrigation scheduling along with the observed irrigation amount applied in the field swat uc shows the irrigation amount simulated by swat model under default plant water stress auto irrigation condition without calibration of λ and epco in addition swat denotes the irrigation amount simulated after calibrating the model using λ 2 and epco 0 6 parameter whereas swat m shows the simulated irrigation from the modified swat model swat m uses a dynamic value of epco which is calculated internally by the model and also it doesn t use λ it can be seen from the results that the overall spread and mean is well replicated by swap as compared to both the swat cases the irrigation amount from swat and swat m is relatively good compared to observed and swap in simulating the mean annual irrigation amount than the one simulated by uncalibrated swat swat uc but still one can see a huge uncertainty in irrigation simulation in terms of higher annual variability and a general underestimation the one by one comparison of simulated irrigation from swap and swat revealed that the overall model response to an extreme dry year 2018 is not well represented in 2018 swap simulated 175 mm and swat models simulated irrigation values ranging from 250 to 350 mm whereas in 2017 which was a wet year all the models simulated either zero or 25 mm of irrigation which is close one can see a general overestimation in 2018 from all the different swat models e g even though the irrigation amount is zero in case of swat uc in all the years but still it has 125 mm of irrigation amount simulated in 2018 this reveals that there is more stress in swat in 2018 compared to other years specifically due to high observed temperature the statistical indicators pbias and correlation r are also used to evaluate the simulated irrigation amount it can be seen from the results that both the models are underestimating the irrigation amount swat by 34 and swap by 11 it should be noted that the one by one matching of observed and simulated irrigation is not possible therefore the bias from the field values is acceptable for simulated irrigation chen et al 2018 as well as crop yield abbaspour et al 2015 this can be justified by several reasons 1 the irrigation amount as applied in the experimental field was based on the combination of previous day s weather conditions along with the forecast of future weather and soil water deficit as well as the condition of the plant plant water stress 2 the irrigation amount applied in one irrigation event in both the models during an irrigation event is the same but in field conditions it varies from year to year and also varies within a year however based on the qualitative and quantitative analysis it can be inferred that simulated irrigation amount from swap swat and swat m is in a good range chen et al 2018 in addition fig 4 shows the year wise comparison of irrigation amounts simulated by swap and different swat models under plant water demand irrigation scheduling technique against the observed irrigation amounts applied in the field it can be seen from the figure that the overall response of observed and modified swat is better swat m compared to the irrigation amounts simulated by calibrated swat model swat however the overall variability is better matched in case of swap simulated irrigation amounts this might be due to the reason that swat sometimes irrigates out of season chen et al 2019 the higher amount can be related to more frequent triggering furthermore the observed amounts applied in the experimental field were restricted in extreme years like 2018 due to over use of water rights fig 5 shows the boxplot comparison of observed obs field and obs ulz and simulated swap swat and swat m wwht during 2008 2018 at hamerstorf in this the auto irrigation scheduling under plant water stress condition was used the overall distribution and crop yield are mostly reduced compared to the yield simulated in fig 2 it can be seen from fig 5 that the overall range of wwht yield simulated by different swat models is nearly the same it can be concluded from this result that water stress is not the dominant stress affecting the crop yield as the same crop parameters were used in two cases swat and swat m figs 2 and 5 the long term mean as well as pbias 6 2 8 8 and r 0 6 0 7 is in accordance with the observed yield of wwht at hamerstorf and the overall prediction uncertainty is less in model simulated results in addition the mean and median of simulated yield from all the models are close to the observed yield of winter wheat in the uelzen district 3 3 other crops evaluation of annual irrigation amount and yield simulated by swat m and swap for corn silage csil sugar beet sgbt and potato pota was also performed for the experimental field it should be noted that in the case of these crops same values of crop parameters were used for calibration and validation from 2008 to 2013 and 2014 2018 respectively fig 6 shows the boxplots of annual irrigation and yield dry matter from csil it is assessed from the boxplots that the mean annual irrigation simulated by swap 125 mm and swat m 75 mm are close to the observed mean 84 mm quantitative analysis revealed an overestimation of simulated irrigation in case of swap by 48 and underestimation in case of swat m by 11 the simulated yield from both the models is matching well with each other difference 0 17 as compared to the observed yield in addition their overall spread and mean is not matching well with the observed yield pbias 8 6 8 7 this could be attributed to the crop model parameters for csil apart from csil figs 7 8 show the comparative evaluation of simulated irrigation amount and crop yield for sgbt and pota respectively it can be seen from figs 7 8 that the simulated irrigation is underestimated in case of sgbt pbias 15 15 15 20 while it is overestimated in case of pota pbias 29 96 to 14 7 for both the crops the overall spread and annual average mean of simulated irrigation the amount is matching relatively well when compared to wwht and csil a general trend is observed in simulating crop yield using swap and swat m which revealed that the simulated yield is always underestimated for all the crops it should be noted that the mean and spread of crop yield from the uelzen district is less compared to hamerstorf figs 6 8 this is expected because not all fields in this region are irrigated and some soils show a poorer quality sandy soil compared to the one in the experimental field loamy sand in case of all crops the overall spread simulated by swap and swat m is covering the observed yield estimated from the uelzen district 3 4 verification of swat m at the catchment scale the swat m was tested for three different catchments with different agroclimatic conditions namely baitarani thubon and wipperau fig 1 fig 9 shows the annual average irrigation amount simulated for the wipperau catchment during 2007 2018 for different crops here obs field is the observed irrigation applied in hamerstorf field given for comparison purpose swat p is the irrigation amount simulated by swat under plant water stress auto irrigation setting whereas swat m is the simulated irrigation amount using the swat m during auto irrigation swat s and swat s m are the irrigation amounts simulated by original and modified swat under soil water deficit auto irrigation setting this is given to check if there is any feedback between the modifications with the soil moisture deficit auto irrigation routine the boxplots from swat s and swat s m show that less irrigation is applied with the new code this difference can be explained by the difference in et 2 due to the changes of the root density distribution this has effect on the transpiration calculated by the model and thus on soil moisture and the triggering of auto irrigation the overall difference reduction in mean annual irrigation in case of swat s m varies from 9 to 10 compared to swat s the overall irrigation amount in case of csil sgbt and wwht have significantly increased as compared to the one simulated by swat p model furthermore simulated irrigation amount for pota is more in case of swat p and swat m compared to the ones applied in the field but the overall spread is less than the amount applied in the field here obs field is used as a reference as there is no other observed data for the whole wipperau catchment it can be assessed from the results that although obs field cannot be directly compared with swat p and swat m but its overall spread and mean will provide useful insight to evaluate the modified swat fig 10 shows the annual average irrigation amounts simulated under plant water stress swat p and soil water deficit swat s irrigation along with the modified swat swat m under plant water stress irrigation scheduling condition for baitarani and thubon catchments during 2000 2010 as the observed irrigation amounts are not available in these catchments therefore irrigation amounts simulated by model under soil water deficit condition swat s is assumed to be close to the local conditions of the catchments by comparing the simulated irrigation amounts with the literature and expert opinions in addition the results reveal a clear improvement in terms of the annual average mean of irrigation amounts simulated using swat m and swat s models as more water is applied in case of swat m therefore it is expected that it will affect et because more water is available for the plant to transpire the results showed a slight increase in catchment s et varying from 0 10 wipperau to 1 10 baitarni and increase in total aquifer recharge from 1 25 thubon to 9 57 wipperau 4 conclusions irrigation scheduling methods help to improve the simulation of irrigation water demand by agro hydrological models the current study modified the swat code in improving the irrigation water demand simulated using plant water stress during 2007 2018 for an experimental site hamerstorf in lower saxony germany a field scale model swap was also used to simulate the irrigation amount and the crop yield from this experimental field swap and swat were calibrated for simulating crop yield of corn silage sugar beet potato and winter wheat the results revealed that the calibrated models were able to simulate the annual irrigation amount and crop yield with acceptable bias however there is uncertainty in model parameters during calibration the proposed modification revealed that root density distribution and dynamic compensation factor play an important role in quantifying the plant water stress in the model during auto irrigation mode it can be seen from the modified swat model that root density distribution soil strength and temperature are affecting the actual root water uptake the verification of the modified swat model at catchment scale was performed it can be concluded from the results that the overall simulation of irrigation amount was improved with only minor impact on the simulated annual yield of different crops catchment s annual average et and total aquifer recharge in general this study has provided a good insight into the process affecting auto irrigation in the case of plant water stress condition in addition there is minor effect of the modified code on the soil water deficit irrigation scheduling method therefore the findings of this study will help researchers to get more consistent irrigation amounts simulated by swat auto irrigation scheduling techniques and thus reduce the uncertainties associated with the simulation of irrigation water demand by swat in particular when observed values are not available as it is the case for climate change predictions it can be seen from the results that improvement can be done in the plant growth modules used by both the models in addition the use of non stationary crop parameters is encouraged as swap was not able to simulate crop yield in extreme years both the models show good capabilities of mimicking the past and current irrigation amounts but they are limited in terms of operational predictions as the weather of the season is not known a priori this limitation can be overcome by using model parameter ensembles or by updating the model once the seasonal weather characteristics becomes clear follow up studies could be done to combine the swat subroutines modified by different authors to build new irrigation routines for the next generation of swat code e g chen et al 2018 for irrigation soil water deficit scheduling under management allowed depletion the current model distributes the same amount of water to the entire hru area however this is not true in actual practice therefore aspects such as model code modifications for applying non uniform distribution of irrigation water can be part of future research in addition aluminum toxicity could be incorporated in the model which authors have neglected for this study future research in irrigation simulation should implement model parameter uncertainty analyses for hydrological models in addition to that the model uncertainty can be dealt with using the model ensemble for simulating irrigation amounts at field and catchment scale acknowledgments the authors would like to thank ms angela riedel and mr ekkehard fricke from landwirtschaftskammer niedersachsen and fachverband feldberegnung e v for providing the necessary

cp flat planting without plastic mulching with four nitrogen levels 0 0 kg n ha 1 1 100 kg n ha 1 2 200 kg n ha 1 3 300 kg n ha 1 in semi arid areas the results indicated that grain filling rate hormonal changes dry matter per plant yield components wue and et of maize under the rf technique were significantly higher as compared with pm and cp cultivation techniques under different nutrient management strategies under the same cultivation techniques as n amount increased up to 200 kg ha 1 the soil water storage phytohormones such as iaa z zr aba content were significantly improved and reducing gas ethylene evolution rate which led to improve maize production as compared with control plots nitrogen applications at 300 kg ha 1 have significantly reduced soil water storage and et rate at different cultivation techniques these results indicated that under the rf3 treatment improved grain filling process wue 55 5 and grain yield 3 0 t ha 1 nitrogen applications at the rate of 300 kg

farming 1 introduction precipitation is the key source of water for maize production in a dry land farming system wen et al 2012 however inadequate and erratic rainfall which led drought condition as a results low production and sometimes total failure of crops ren et al 2010 nutrients and water shortage are the two main limiting factors which un stabilized maize production abbas et al 2005 but several rain fed regions researches works to have given more interest to wue as compared with fertilizer use efficiency which restricted the potential of land for crops productivity barbieri et al 2012 to improving the grain yield of crops such as maize in the semi arid area is to best consumption of the rainwater and improved soil water storage to attain the largest possible enhance in the fertilizer use efficiency and wue sangoi et al 2002 the grain filling rates and maize production has been greatly effects by varying the nitrogen levels nagaz et al 2012 similarly rf planting has significantly increased the mean seed filling rate of maize as compared with flat planting without plastic mulching li et al 2001 it is hard to increase plant growth in dry land farming systems due to water shortage which restricted to uptake of crop nutrients and water wang et al 2015a b several research works have reported that rf cultivation technique has been usually urbanized and applied in rain fed areas which significantly increase the utilization of precipitation and enhance the wue jia et al 2006 zhang et al 2015 the plastic film mulching can improve crop productivity by saving water from light rainfall and reducing the surface runoff from the heavy rainfall li et al 2016 seghatoleslami et al 2008 as well the rf system can supply adequate moisture at the key growth stages and decrease top soil evaporations as a result increase wue wu et al 2015 earlier research works have been recommended that the rf system affected the maize production grain which may be correlated to soil temperature moisture and nutrition s bu et al 2013 han et al 2014 but the biochemical mechanism under the nutrient and planting modes strategies increased or decreases the maize production is not yet clear fertilizer use efficiency can significantly increase by efficient use of precipitation which sustains crop productivity in rain fed areas xu et al 2007 due to considering the precipitation patterns in rain fed areas the soil fertility can be optimized by improving the efficient use of precipitation under the rf system and avoiding severe drought stress thus increasing maize production by enhancing the uptake of soil nutrients and water li et al 2004 the maize potential yield has three main components ear plant 1 grain ear 1 and single grain weight tiquia et al 2002 the final stage of growth is called grain filling stage in which fertilized ovaries develop into caryopses singh et al 2010 it is essential to know how nutrients and planting modes strategies affect the seed filling process of maize crop but no literature is accessible about the combined effects of nutrients and planting modes strategies on the seed filling rate of maize and their biochemical mechanism increase or decreased the grain weight excessively use of nutrients is not helpful for improving maize production but optimum supply of nutrients and water can significantly improve the biomass and grian yields li et al 2009 inadequate of soil water storage throughout the seed filling stage the plant leaves pre maturely senescence as a resulting decrease in grain filling duration and yields gao et al 2015 the rf planting has maximum soil water storage which increased soil water contents and significantly accelerating the grain filling process as a result improved average seed filling rates wang et al 2015a b in cereals crops plant hormones play a significant role in the regulatory grain filling rate zeatin and zeatin riboside z zr indole 3 acetic acid iaa and abscisic acid aba contents in maize seeds is positively associated while gibberellic acid ga3 is negatively linked with the seed filling process xu et al 2013 the iaa and aba improve rapidly in the early seed filling and then decline slowly at maturity stage liu et al 2013 the ethylene z zr and aba significantly regulated the seed filling in maize and winter wheat which indicated that grains hormones obviously influence the grain filling rates in cereals crops hu et al 2014 wang et al 2014 previous research works reported that rf planting had focused mostly on regulation of water such as appropriate rainfall irrigation ridges cover materials and ridge furrow ratios gao et al 2000 ren et al 2010 however the relationship between such hormonal changes and grain filling induced by different nutrients and planting modes strategies remains unclear therefore we study the combined effects of nutrients and planting modes strategies in iaa aba z zr gas and eth in wheat grains during the grain filling process the objective of the study was to investigate the effect of nutrients and planting modes strategies on the grain filling process of winter wheat and how changes in endogenous hormones in the developing grains of winter wheat sws and wue related to the grain filling process 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this research work was carried out during 2016 17 in huan county eastern gansu province north

2017 between adjacent plots a 0 8 m wide space was maintained to stop n and water seepage weeds were control manually and during the two growing years irrigation water was not supplied 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water storage moisture content was determined in the furrows at 20 cm intervals to a depth of 200 cm at the planting time seedling jointing flowering grain filling and harvesting stages from 2016 2017 moisture content at 20 cm intervals in 0 200 cm soil layers was recorded using a tdr meter time domain reflectometry trase system soil moisture equipment corp germany soil water storage was calculated by using following formula ali et al 2017 1 sws c ρ h 10 where sws is the soil water storage c is the soil moisture ρ is the soil bulk density and h is the soil depth

were analyzed separately means among treatments were compared based on the least significant difference test lsd 0 05 significance level was set at p 0 05 4 results 4 1 soil water storage and evoptranspiration during both years almost have same sws with no significant variations at 20 dap soil moisture changed under different nutrient and planting modes strategies due to various rainfalls and its distribution events fig 3 the crop water consumption rate increased with crop growth but the rf2 and pm2 treatments were recorded no drought conditions which make sure the successful growth of crops the sws under the rf2 planting at the 0 2 m soil layers was significantly maximum at different growth stages except 20 dap than that of all treatments at each treatment a trend of sws was significantly improved from 40 to 120 dap than that of 20 dap at 80 dap the average of two year data revealed that under rf2 treatment the sws had significantly increased by 5 8 compared with rf1 treatment at various planting modes strategies with 200 kg n ha 1 has significantly improved sws than that of 300 kg n ha 1 throughout the growth stages there were non significant differences in the sws among the different treatments from 60 to 80 dap during both study years as the n fertilizer levels improved up to 200 kg ha 1 under different planting modes strategies the sws increased except 300 kg n ha 1 throughout the growth stages of maize crop fig 3 the table 4 showed that there were considerable variations in et among the various treatments maize growth was fast with the maximum rainwater consumption as a result higher transpiration under the cp treatment with various n fertilizer levels led to higher et rate than that of rf and pm cultivation techniques in 2016 under the rf1 rf2 and rf3 treatments the et was significantly improved by 5 1 6 9 and 9 6 than that of rf0 treatment and pm1 pm2 pm3 treatment were significantly improved the seasonal et by the 2 0 4 7 and 9 1 as evaluated with pm0 treatment while compared with cp0 treatment the et rate under the cp1 cp2 cp3 treatments were significantly improved by 8 3 11 0 and 15 3 respectively in 2017 under the rf1 rf2 and rf3 treatments the et was significantly improved by 2 6 4 7 and 7 9 than that of rf0 treatment and pm1 pm2 pm3 treatments were significantly improved the seasonal et by the 10 7 16 8 and 21 5 as evaluated with pm0 treatment while compared with cp0 treatment the et rate under the cp1 cp2 cp3 treatments were significantly increased by 8 6 15 8 and 21 9 respectively 4 2 characteristics of grain filling the field study of two year confirmed that the wmax gmax and gmean increased with increasing n fertilizer levels under different cultivation techniques table 2 during 2016 year under the rf and pm cultivation techniques at different n fertilizer levels the wmax gmax and gmean have non significant difference while the wmax gmax and gmean were significantly decreased under the low n level than that of high n level under the different cultivation techniques the wmax gmax and gmean were significantly higher under the higher n fertilizer level with rf and pm cultivation techniques during the 2017 however under the rf and pm planting models there was non significant variation between the 200 and 300 kg n ha 1 respectively the occurrence time of maximal filling tmax under the rf and pm cultivation techniques was significantly later as compared with cp cultivation technique under the 200 and 300 kg n ha 1 during 2016 17 however during both study years under the rf and pm treatments there was non significant variation in agp the agp improved with improving n levels under different cultivation techniques the agp was significantly higher under higher n level than that of low n fertilizer level under different cultivation techniques 4 3 hormonal changes 4 3 1 iaa and z zr contents at the early seed filling stages the iaa and z zr quickly increased and then declined under the rf planting the iaa and z zr was significantly improved than that of pm and cp planting techniques figs 4 and 5 the rf system significantly affected the iaa and z zr under various n fertilizer levels the rf planting with 300 kg n ha 1 significantly improved the iaa and z zr contents as compared with pm and cp cultivation techniques under same n fertilizer level under the rf3 and pm3 cultivation techniques the iaa and z zr was significantly improved at 3 24 days after silking as compared with cp3 cultivation technique also the peak of the iaa and z zr under the rf3 cultivation technique was higher than that of pm3 and cp3 treatments at 18 das the iaa and z zr under the rf and pm cultivation techniques reached to maximum value while at 21 das the iaa and z zr contents in the grains of the cp cultivation technique reached a maximum value the rf planting with 200 kg n ha 1 also significantly improved the iaa and z zr in the early seed filling stage however the peak of the iaa and z zr under the rf system was synchronous as compared with pm cultivation technique the rf2 treatment also significantly enhanced the iaa and z zr than that of pm and cp cultivation techniques 4 3 2 aba content at the early seed filling stages the aba rapidly improved and then declined under the rf3 cultivation technique the aba content was significantly improved as compared with pm3 and cp3 planting techniques fig 6 under the rf2 or rf3 treatments significantly improved the aba content compared with pm and cp cultivation techniques however under cp cultivation technique with 0 or 100 kg n ha 1has non significant effects on the aba content while cp cultivation technique with 200 or 300 kg n ha 1only significantly improved the aba content 4 3 3 ga and eth evolution rate the gas and eth indicated the similar changing trends during seed filling stage the gas and eth reduced gradually in the whole grain filling stage figs 7 and 8 the gas and eth were significantly higher under cp cultivation technique than those of rf and pm cultivation techniques in the whole seed filling stage under the cp1 treatment significantly increased the gas and eth than that of rf and pm cultivation techniques under same n fertilizer level in contrast at the 100 kg n ha 1 rf and pm cultivation techniques significantly decreased the gas and the eth as compared with cp cultivation technique at the 100 or 200 kg n ha 1 with different cultivation techniques had no significant variation was observed for the gas and the eth however the gas and the eth under the rf0 cultivation technique were significantly lower than those to pm0 and cp0 cultivation techniques table 3 4 4 dry matter accumulation and yield components in 2016 the pre silking dry matter indicated a considerable variation among the three cultivation techniques under different n fertilizer levels table 4 while under the rf and pm cultivation techniques the post silking dry matter was significantly maximum compared to cp cultivation technique at four different n fertilizer levels during 2016 under the rf system the pre silking post silking and the total dry matter was significantly maximum as compared with pm and cp cultivation techniques the mean of two year data revealed that the rf and pm planting methods the total dry matter plant 1 significantly improved by 19 8 and 15 6 compared with cp planting under the same cultivation techniques the total dry matter significantly improved with the increasing of n fertilizer levels under the rf3 and pm3 treatments the total dry matter in 2016 increased by 10 5 and 7 6 and by 20 6 and 17 9 in 2017 than that of cp3 the ridge furrow system with plastic film mulching produced the highest grain yield was due to maximum kernels ear 1 ear length kernel weight ear 1 thousand kernels weight and yield per plant under the rf and pm cultivation techniques the maximum grain yield per plant was regarded than that of cp cultivation technique due to its higher yield components and efficient precipitation utilization 4 5 wue and production the wue under the rf and pm cultivation techniques significantly increased as compared with cp cultivation technique and there was also considerable variation in wue between the rf and pm cultivation techniques table 5 under the rf3 and pm3 cultivation techniques the mean of two year wue improved by 55 5 and 34 4 then that of cp3 cultivation technique evaluated with the cp2 cultivation technique the mean of two year wue improved by 48 9 and 31 6 under rf2 and pm2 cultivation techniques the wue under rf1 and pm1 cultivation techniques was increased by 56 7 and 32 6 then that of cp2 cultivation technique during 2016 17 under the various n fertilizer levels with different planting methods significantly increased the maize production the average of two years data revealed that maize seed yield for each of the treatments was ranked as rf3 pm3 rf2 rf1 pm2 pm1 cp3 cp2 cp1 rf0 pm0 cp0 cultivation techniques the average grain yield with rf0 rf1 rf2 rf3 pm0 pm1 pm2 and pm3 were significantly increased by 1 1 t ha 1 19 3 3 0 t ha 1 43 1 2 5 t ha 1 32 5 3 0 t ha 1 36 2 0 6 t ha 1 11 0 1 9 t ha 1 27 0 2 0 t ha 1 26 0 and 2 3 t ha 1 28 2 respectively as compared with cp0 cp1 cp2 and cp3 treatments table 5 4 6 correlation coefficients the correlation coefficients indicated significant variation in the peak hormone contents seed filling rate wue and grain yield of the maize plants table 5 the iaa z zr aba and ga contents in the seeds significantly positively correlated with the maximum and mean seed filling rates agp tmax and the maximum seed weight respectively however the eth evolution rate of the grains was negatively and significantly correlated with the maximum and mean seed filling rates agp tmax and the maximum seed weight 5 discussion 5 1 effects of nutrients and planting modes strategies on sws and production soil water shortage is an essential limiting factor for maize productivity in the rain fed regions du et al 2015 while the sws was primarily influenced by rainfall which is the most vital water source for dry land farming system liu et al 2014 the rf planting reduced evaporation and can efficiently save more precipitation in the soil as compared with flat cultivation hu et al 2014 we found that under the rf2 and pm2 treatments were recorded no drought conditions which makes sure the successful growth of maize plant under the rf planting rainwater directly moves into the planting zone and then deep penetration in soil so decrease water losses by evaporation gan et al 2008 we also found that the rf2 treatment sws was significantly increased at different growth stages than that of all treatments frequent drought is also an important factor that limits crop yields previous studies have suggested that rf system with medium n application could significantly improve the moisture temperature and the nutrients of soil and that the rf system is an effective way to increase water availability for crop yield martinez et al 2011 blanco moure et al 2012 the rf model is better consuming the light rainfall as a result the swc under rf system was significantly maximum as compared with cp cultivation model ren et al 2010 the fig 3 showed that as the n fertilizer levels improved up to 200 kg ha 1 under different planting modes strategies the sws increased throughout the growth stages of maize crop transpiration is the key mechanism of water utilization which is positive relationship with biomass therefore the cultivation techniques and nutrients had a considerable effect on et rate xu et al 2007 under the cp treatment with various n fertilizer levels led to higher et rate than that of rf and pm cultivation techniques 5 2 relationship between maize seed filling process and hormone changes grain filling which determines the grain weight is an important agronomic trait of maize and previous studies have indicated that ct significantly affects the grain weight of wheat liu et al 2004 zhang et al 2009 the active seed filling duration finds out the final grain yield this seed filling rate is not only calculated hereditarily however its also affected by ecological environment such as sowing date nutrients level planting modes and cultivation models wu et al 2011 earlier research works reported that rf system with nutrient strategies promoted the seed filling process early as compared with flat cultivation without plastic film mulching as a result improved the maize seed filling process and final grain weight zhang et al 2010 we find out that the wmax gmax and gmean were significantly higher under the higher n fertilizer level with rf and pm cultivation techniques however under the rf and pm planting models there was non significant variation between the 200 and 300 kg n ha 1 maize grains can be divided into superior and inferior grains according to the degree and rate of filling yang and zhang 2010 suggested that super rice cultivars frequently do not exhibit their high yield potential due to the poor grain filling of inferior grains the agp improved with improving n levels under different cultivation techniques the agp was significantly higher under higher n level than that of low n fertilizer level under different cultivation techniques xu et al 2007 have suggested that non flooded plastic mulching cultivation significantly decreases the grain filling rate and grain weight of inferior grains of rice compared to traditional flooding cultivation however this cultivation has no such effect on superior rice grains indicating that the inferior grains are more sensitive to soil moisture grain filling is significantly synchronized by cytokinins ctks and iaa which has been significantly linked with grain development zhang et al 2009a iaa and ctks are generally found in the grain of maize endosperm which is essential for cell partition yang et al 2002 at 18 das the iaa and z zr under the rf and pm cultivation techniques reached to maximum value while at 21 das the iaa and z zr of the cp cultivation technique reached a maximum value singh and gerung 1982 reported that in the early silking stage the iaa and z zr may normalize maize seed filling most probable using the management of endosperm cell division the iaa z zr eth and aba play key roles in regulated seed filling yang et al 2006 reported that the maximum aba content and minimum eth evolution rate found in maize seeds were play key roles in a regulated higher grain filling process we also find a same result that the aba content transiently increased and then decline under the rf3 cultivation technique the aba content improved than that of pm3 and cp3 planting techniques fig 6 however cp cultivation technique with 200 or 300 kg n ha 1only significantly improved the aba content yang et al 2006 reported that aba improves the eth which controls the grain filling rate in peas crop a rapid pod elongation was due to maximum gas content in the endosperm eeuwens and schwabe 1975 relatively large panicle of rice just before and at flowering was due to high levels of gas content yang et al 2006 at the 100 or 200 kg n ha 1 with different cultivation techniques had no significant variation was observed for the gas and eth however the gas and eth under the rf0 cultivation technique were significantly lower than those to pm0 and cp0 cultivation techniques this outcome shows that aba promotes while eth inhibits a seed filling process of maize this is consistent with an earlier study suzuki et al 1981 in addition to z zr and iaa aba and eth also play important roles in regulated grain filling yang et al 2006 suggested that the higher aba concentration and lower eth concentration found in superior versus inferior wheat grains were associated with a higher filling rate in the superior grains 5 3 water use efficiency biomass and grain yield the crop water utilization is directly associated with biomass production li et al 2001 the rf planting with nutrient strategies can enhance the soil water thereby increasing the biomass production ma et al 2008 we also find out that under the rf system the pre silking post silking and total dry matter was significantly maximum as compared with pm and cp cultivation techniques under the plastic film mulching with nutrient strategies improved the dry matter by raising soil moisture utilization efficiently and speeds up the maize development payero et al 2008 but under the same cultivation techniques the total dry matter significantly improved with the increasing of n fertilizer levels under the rf3 and pm3 treatments the total dry matter in 2016 increased by 10 5 and 7 6 and by 20 6 and 17 9 in 2017 than that of cp3 the ridge furrow system with plastic film mulching produced the highest grain yield was due to maximum soil water storage fertilization can significantly improve the transpiration which is the main mechanism to improving the wue chen et al 2011 under the rf3 and pm3 cultivation techniques the mean of two year wue improved by 55 5 and 34 4 than that of cp3 cultivation technique the rf planting can improve the accessibility of

result efficiently improving the precipitation utilization and wue li and gong 2002 6 conclusion the outcome of current research work clearly recommended that grain filling rate hormonal changes dry matter yield components wue and et of maize under the rf technique were significantly higher as compared with pm and cp cultivation techniques under different nutrient strategies under the same cultivation techniques as n levels increased to 200 kg n ha 1 the soil water storage phytohormones such as iaa z zr aba content were significantly improved and reducing gas eth evolution rate which led to improve maize production as compared with control plots nitrogen applications at 300 kg ha 1 have significantly reduced soil water storage and et rate at different cultivation techniques these

cp flat planting without plastic mulching with four nitrogen levels 0 0 kg n ha 1 1 100 kg n ha 1 2 200 kg n ha 1 3 300 kg n ha 1 in semi arid areas the results indicated that grain filling rate hormonal changes dry matter per plant yield components wue and et of maize under the rf technique were significantly higher as compared with pm and cp cultivation techniques under different nutrient management strategies under the same cultivation techniques as n amount increased up to 200 kg ha 1 the soil water storage phytohormones such as iaa z zr aba content were significantly improved and reducing gas ethylene evolution rate which led to improve maize production as compared with control plots nitrogen applications at 300 kg ha 1 have significantly reduced soil water storage and et rate at different cultivation techniques these results indicated that under the rf3 treatment improved grain filling process wue 55 5 and grain yield 3 0 t ha 1 nitrogen applications at the rate of 300 kg

from our results that the rf3 treatment is an innovative cultivation technique to significantly improve the soil water storage wue total dry mater accumulation 19 8 grain filling rates thereby balance hormonal changes in maize seeds as a result increase maize yields in semi arid regions keywords planting models nutrient hormone grain filling process water use efficiency maize production dry land farming 1 introduction precipitation is the key source of water for maize production in a dry land farming system wen et al 2012 however inadequate and erratic rainfall which led drought condition as a results low production and sometimes total failure of crops ren et al 2010 nutrients and water shortage are the two main limiting factors which un stabilized maize production abbas et al 2005 but several rain fed regions researches works to have given more interest to wue as compared with fertilizer use efficiency which restricted the potential of land for crops productivity barbieri et al 2012 to improving the grain yield of crops such as maize in the semi arid area is to best consumption of the rainwater and improved soil water storage to attain the largest possible enhance in the fertilizer use efficiency and wue sangoi et al 2002 the grain filling rates and maize production has been greatly effects by varying the nitrogen levels nagaz et al 2012 similarly rf planting has significantly increased the mean seed filling rate of maize as compared with flat planting without plastic mulching li et al 2001 it is hard to increase plant growth in dry land farming systems due to water shortage which restricted to uptake of crop nutrients and water wang et al 2015a b several research works have reported that rf cultivation technique has been usually urbanized and applied in rain fed areas which significantly increase the utilization of precipitation and enhance the wue jia et al 2006 zhang et al 2015 the plastic film mulching can improve crop productivity by saving water from light rainfall and reducing the surface runoff from the heavy rainfall li et al 2016 seghatoleslami et al 2008 as well the rf system can supply adequate moisture at the key growth stages and decrease top soil evaporations as a result increase wue wu et al 2015 earlier research works have been recommended that the rf system affected the maize production grain which may be correlated to soil temperature moisture and nutrition s bu et al 2013 han et al 2014 but the biochemical mechanism under the nutrient and planting modes strategies increased or decreases the maize production is not yet clear fertilizer use efficiency can significantly increase by efficient use of precipitation which sustains crop productivity in rain fed areas xu et al 2007 due to considering the precipitation patterns in rain fed areas the soil fertility can be optimized by improving the efficient use of precipitation under the rf system and avoiding severe drought stress thus increasing maize production by enhancing the uptake of soil nutrients and water li et al 2004 the maize potential yield has three main components ear plant 1 grain ear 1 and single grain weight tiquia et al 2002 the final stage of growth is called grain filling stage in which fertilized ovaries develop into caryopses singh et al 2010 it is essential to know how nutrients and planting modes strategies affect the seed filling process of maize crop but no literature is accessible about the combined effects of nutrients and planting modes strategies on the seed filling rate of maize and their biochemical mechanism increase or decreased the grain weight excessively use of nutrients is not helpful for improving maize production but optimum supply of nutrients and water can significantly improve the biomass and grian yields li et al 2009 inadequate of soil water storage throughout the seed filling stage the plant leaves pre maturely senescence as a resulting decrease in grain filling duration and yields gao et al 2015 the rf planting has maximum soil water storage which increased soil water contents and significantly accelerating the grain filling process as a result improved average seed filling rates wang et al 2015a b in cereals crops plant hormones play a significant role in the regulatory grain filling rate zeatin and zeatin riboside z zr indole 3 acetic acid iaa and abscisic acid aba contents in maize seeds is positively associated while gibberellic acid ga3 is negatively linked with the seed filling process xu et al 2013 the iaa and aba improve rapidly in the early seed filling and then decline slowly at maturity stage liu et al 2013 the ethylene z zr and aba significantly regulated the seed filling in maize and winter wheat which indicated that grains hormones obviously influence the grain filling rates in cereals crops hu et al 2014 wang et al 2014 previous research works reported that rf planting had focused mostly on regulation of water such as appropriate rainfall irrigation ridges cover materials and ridge furrow ratios gao et al 2000 ren et al 2010 however the relationship between such hormonal changes and grain filling induced by different nutrients and planting modes strategies remains unclear therefore we study the combined effects of nutrients and planting modes strategies in iaa aba z zr gas and eth in wheat grains during the grain filling process the objective of the study was to investigate the effect of nutrients and planting modes strategies on the grain filling process of winter wheat and how changes in endogenous hormones in the developing grains of winter wheat sws and wue related to the grain filling process 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this research work was carried out during 2016 17 in huan county eastern gansu province north

were analyzed separately means among treatments were compared based on the least significant difference test lsd 0 05 significance level was set at p 0 05 4 results 4 1 soil water storage and evoptranspiration during both years almost have same sws with no significant variations at 20 dap soil moisture changed under different nutrient and planting modes strategies due to various rainfalls and its distribution events fig 3 the crop water consumption rate increased with crop growth but the rf2 and pm2 treatments were recorded no drought conditions which make sure the successful growth of crops the sws under the rf2 planting at the 0 2 m soil layers was significantly maximum at different growth stages except 20 dap than that of all treatments at each treatment a trend of sws was significantly improved from 40 to 120 dap than that of 20 dap at 80 dap the average of two year data revealed that under rf2 treatment the sws had significantly increased by 5 8 compared with rf1 treatment at various planting modes strategies with 200 kg n ha 1 has significantly improved sws than that of 300 kg n ha 1 throughout the growth stages there were non significant differences in the sws among the different treatments from 60 to 80 dap during both study years as the n fertilizer levels improved up to 200 kg ha 1 under different planting modes strategies the sws increased except 300 kg n ha 1 throughout the growth stages of maize crop fig 3 the table 4 showed that there were considerable variations in et among the various treatments maize growth was fast with the maximum rainwater consumption as a result higher transpiration under the cp treatment with various n fertilizer levels led to higher et rate than that of rf and pm cultivation techniques in 2016 under the rf1 rf2 and rf3 treatments the et was significantly improved by 5 1 6 9 and 9 6 than that of rf0 treatment and pm1 pm2 pm3 treatment were significantly improved the seasonal et by the 2 0 4 7 and 9 1 as evaluated with pm0 treatment while compared with cp0 treatment the et rate under the cp1 cp2 cp3 treatments were significantly improved by 8 3 11 0 and 15 3 respectively in 2017 under the rf1 rf2 and rf3 treatments the et was significantly improved by 2 6 4 7 and 7 9 than that of rf0 treatment and pm1 pm2 pm3 treatments were significantly improved the seasonal et by the 10 7 16 8 and 21 5 as evaluated with pm0 treatment while compared with cp0 treatment the et rate under the cp1 cp2 cp3 treatments were significantly increased by 8 6 15 8 and 21 9 respectively 4 2 characteristics of grain filling the field study of two year confirmed that the wmax gmax and gmean increased with increasing n fertilizer levels under different cultivation techniques table 2 during 2016 year under the rf

than that of high n level under the different cultivation techniques the wmax gmax and gmean were significantly higher under the higher n fertilizer level with rf and pm cultivation techniques during the 2017 however under the rf and pm planting models there was non significant variation between the 200 and 300 kg n ha 1 respectively the occurrence time of maximal filling tmax under the rf and pm cultivation techniques was significantly later as compared with cp cultivation technique under the 200 and 300 kg n ha 1 during 2016 17 however during both study years under the rf and pm treatments there was non significant variation in agp the agp improved with improving n levels under different cultivation techniques the agp was significantly higher under higher n level than that of low n fertilizer level under different cultivation techniques 4 3 hormonal changes 4 3 1 iaa and z zr contents at the early seed filling stages the iaa and z zr quickly increased and then declined under the rf planting the iaa and z zr was significantly improved than that of pm and cp planting techniques figs 4 and 5 the rf system significantly affected the iaa and z zr under various n fertilizer levels the rf planting with 300 kg n ha 1 significantly improved the iaa and z zr contents as compared with pm and cp cultivation techniques under same n fertilizer level under the rf3 and pm3 cultivation techniques the iaa and z zr was significantly improved at 3 24 days after silking as compared with cp3 cultivation technique also the peak of the iaa and z zr under the rf3 cultivation technique was higher than that of pm3 and cp3 treatments at 18 das the iaa and z zr under the rf and pm cultivation techniques reached to maximum value while at 21 das the iaa and z zr contents in the grains of the cp cultivation technique reached a maximum value the rf planting with 200 kg n ha 1 also significantly improved the iaa and z zr in the early seed filling stage however the peak of the iaa and z zr under the rf system was synchronous as compared with pm cultivation technique the rf2 treatment also significantly enhanced the iaa and z zr than that of pm and cp cultivation techniques 4 3 2 aba content at the early seed filling stages the aba rapidly improved and then declined under the rf3 cultivation technique the aba content was significantly improved as compared with pm3 and cp3 planting techniques fig 6 under the rf2 or rf3 treatments significantly improved the aba content compared with pm and cp cultivation techniques however under cp cultivation technique with 0 or 100 kg n ha 1has non significant effects on the aba content while cp cultivation technique with 200 or 300 kg n ha 1only significantly improved the aba content 4 3 3 ga and eth evolution rate the gas and eth indicated the similar changing trends during seed filling stage the gas and eth reduced gradually in the whole grain filling stage figs 7 and 8 the gas and eth were significantly higher under cp cultivation technique than those of rf and pm cultivation techniques in the whole seed filling stage under the cp1 treatment significantly increased the gas and eth than that of rf and pm cultivation techniques under same n fertilizer level in contrast at the 100 kg n ha 1 rf and pm cultivation techniques significantly decreased the gas and the eth as compared with cp cultivation technique at the 100 or 200 kg n ha 1 with different cultivation techniques had no significant variation was observed for the gas and the eth however the gas and the eth under the rf0 cultivation technique were significantly lower than those to pm0 and cp0 cultivation techniques table 3 4 4 dry matter accumulation and yield components in 2016 the pre silking dry matter indicated a considerable variation among the three cultivation techniques under different n fertilizer levels table 4 while under the rf and pm cultivation techniques the post silking dry matter was significantly maximum compared to cp cultivation technique at four different n fertilizer levels during 2016 under the rf system the pre silking post silking and the total dry matter was significantly maximum as compared with pm and cp cultivation techniques the mean of two year data revealed that the rf and pm planting methods the total dry matter plant 1 significantly improved by 19 8 and 15 6 compared with cp planting under the same cultivation techniques the total dry matter significantly improved with the increasing of n fertilizer levels under the rf3 and pm3 treatments the total dry matter in 2016 increased by 10 5 and 7 6 and by 20 6 and 17 9 in 2017 than that of cp3 the ridge furrow system with plastic film mulching produced the highest grain yield was due to maximum kernels ear 1 ear length kernel weight ear 1 thousand kernels weight and yield per plant under the rf and pm cultivation techniques the maximum grain yield per plant was regarded than that of cp cultivation technique due to its higher yield components and efficient precipitation utilization 4 5 wue and production the wue under the rf and pm cultivation techniques significantly increased as compared with cp cultivation technique and there was also considerable variation in wue between the rf and pm cultivation techniques table 5 under the rf3 and pm3 cultivation techniques the mean of two year wue improved by 55 5 and 34 4 then that of cp3 cultivation technique evaluated with the cp2 cultivation technique the mean of two year wue improved by 48 9 and 31 6 under rf2 and pm2 cultivation techniques the wue under rf1 and pm1 cultivation techniques was increased by 56 7 and 32 6 then that of cp2 cultivation technique during 2016 17 under the various n fertilizer levels with different planting methods significantly increased the maize production the average of two years data revealed that maize seed yield for each of the treatments was ranked as rf3 pm3 rf2 rf1 pm2 pm1 cp3 cp2 cp1 rf0 pm0 cp0 cultivation techniques the average grain yield with rf0 rf1 rf2 rf3 pm0 pm1 pm2 and pm3 were significantly increased by 1 1 t ha 1 19 3 3 0 t ha 1 43 1 2 5 t ha 1 32 5 3 0 t ha 1 36 2 0 6 t ha 1 11 0 1 9 t ha 1 27 0 2 0 t ha 1 26 0 and 2 3 t ha 1 28 2 respectively as compared with cp0 cp1 cp2 and cp3 treatments table 5 4 6 correlation coefficients the correlation coefficients indicated significant variation in the peak hormone contents seed filling rate wue and grain yield of the maize plants table 5 the iaa z zr aba and ga contents in the seeds significantly positively correlated with the maximum and mean seed filling rates agp tmax and the maximum seed weight respectively however the eth evolution rate of the grains was negatively and significantly correlated with the maximum and mean seed filling rates agp tmax and the maximum seed weight 5 discussion 5 1 effects of nutrients and planting modes strategies on sws and production soil water shortage is an essential limiting factor for maize productivity in the rain fed regions du et al 2015 while the sws was primarily influenced by rainfall which is the most vital water source for dry land farming system liu et al 2014 the rf planting reduced evaporation and can efficiently save more precipitation in the soil as compared with flat cultivation hu et al 2014 we found that under the rf2 and pm2 treatments were recorded no drought conditions which makes sure the successful growth of maize plant under the rf planting rainwater directly moves into the planting zone and then deep penetration in soil so decrease water losses by evaporation gan et al 2008 we also found that the rf2 treatment sws was significantly increased at different growth stages than that of all treatments frequent drought is also an important factor that limits crop yields previous studies have suggested that rf system with medium n application could significantly improve the moisture temperature and the nutrients of soil and that the rf system is an effective way to increase water availability for crop yield martinez et al 2011 blanco moure et al 2012 the rf model is better consuming the light rainfall as a result the swc under rf system was significantly maximum as compared with cp cultivation model ren et al 2010 the fig 3 showed that as the n fertilizer levels improved up to 200 kg ha 1 under different planting modes strategies the sws increased throughout the growth stages of maize crop transpiration is the key mechanism of water utilization which is positive relationship with biomass therefore the cultivation techniques and nutrients had a considerable effect on et rate xu et al 2007 under the cp treatment with various n fertilizer levels led to higher et rate than that of rf and pm cultivation techniques 5 2 relationship between maize seed filling process and hormone changes grain filling which determines the grain weight is an important agronomic trait of maize and previous studies have indicated that ct significantly affects the grain weight of wheat liu et al 2004 zhang et al 2009 the active seed filling duration finds out the final grain yield this seed filling rate is not only calculated hereditarily however its also affected by ecological environment such as sowing date nutrients level planting modes and cultivation models wu et al 2011 earlier research works reported that rf system with nutrient strategies promoted the seed filling process early as compared with flat cultivation without plastic film mulching as a result improved the maize seed filling process and final grain weight zhang et al 2010 we find out that the wmax gmax and gmean were significantly higher under the higher n fertilizer level with rf and pm cultivation techniques however under the rf and pm planting models there was non significant variation between the 200 and 300 kg n ha 1 maize grains can be divided into superior and inferior grains according to the degree and rate of filling yang and zhang 2010 suggested that super rice cultivars frequently do not exhibit their high yield potential due to the poor grain filling of inferior grains the agp improved with improving n levels under different cultivation techniques the agp was significantly higher under higher n level than that of low n fertilizer level under different cultivation techniques xu et al 2007 have suggested that non flooded plastic mulching cultivation significantly decreases the grain filling rate and grain weight of inferior grains of rice compared to traditional flooding cultivation however this cultivation has no such effect on superior rice grains indicating that the inferior grains are more sensitive to soil moisture grain filling is significantly synchronized by cytokinins ctks and iaa which has been significantly linked with grain development zhang et al 2009a iaa and ctks are generally found in the grain of maize endosperm which is essential for cell partition yang et al 2002 at 18 das the iaa and z zr under the rf and pm cultivation techniques reached to maximum value while at 21 das the iaa and z zr of the cp cultivation technique reached a maximum value singh and gerung 1982 reported that in the early silking stage the iaa and z zr may normalize maize seed filling most probable using the management of endosperm cell division the iaa z zr eth and aba play key roles in regulated seed filling yang et al 2006 reported that the maximum aba content and minimum eth evolution rate found in maize seeds were play key roles in a regulated higher grain filling process we also find a same result that the aba content transiently increased and then decline under the rf3 cultivation technique the aba content improved than that of pm3 and cp3 planting techniques fig 6 however cp cultivation technique with 200 or 300 kg n ha 1only significantly improved the aba content yang et al 2006 reported that aba improves the eth which controls the grain filling rate in peas crop a rapid pod elongation was due to maximum gas content in the endosperm eeuwens and schwabe 1975 relatively large panicle of rice just before and at flowering was due to high levels of gas content yang et al 2006 at the 100 or 200 kg n ha 1 with different cultivation techniques had no significant variation was observed for the gas and eth however the gas and eth under the rf0 cultivation technique were significantly lower than those to pm0 and cp0 cultivation techniques this outcome shows that aba promotes while eth inhibits a seed filling process of maize this is consistent with an earlier study suzuki et al 1981 in addition to z zr and iaa aba and eth also play important roles in regulated grain filling yang et al 2006 suggested that the higher aba concentration and lower eth concentration found in superior versus inferior wheat grains were associated with a higher filling rate in the superior grains 5 3 water use efficiency biomass and grain yield the crop water utilization is directly associated with biomass production li et al 2001 the rf planting with nutrient strategies can enhance the soil water thereby increasing the biomass production ma et al 2008 we also find out that under the rf system the pre silking post silking and total dry matter was significantly maximum as compared with pm and cp cultivation techniques under the plastic film mulching with nutrient strategies improved the dry matter by raising soil moisture utilization efficiently and speeds up the maize development payero et al 2008 but under the same cultivation techniques the total dry matter significantly improved with the increasing of n fertilizer levels under the rf3 and pm3 treatments the total dry matter in 2016 increased by 10 5 and 7 6 and by 20 6 and 17 9 in 2017 than that of cp3 the ridge furrow system with plastic film mulching produced the highest grain yield was due to maximum soil water storage fertilization can significantly improve the transpiration which is the main mechanism to improving the wue chen et al 2011 under the rf3 and pm3 cultivation techniques the mean of two year wue improved by 55 5 and 34 4 than that of cp3 cultivation technique the rf planting can improve the accessibility of rainwater to crops then that of flat planting thereby maximum wue ren et al 2008 the average grain yields with rf0 rf1 rf2 rf3 pm0 pm1 pm2 and pm3 were significantly increased by 19 3 43 1 32 5 36 2 11 0 27 0 26 0 and 28 2 respectively as compared with cp0 cp1 cp2 and cp3 treatments table 5 hu et al 2014 find out that no need to implement rf planting where greater than 400 mm of rainfall and increasing the maize yield under plastic film was not significantly than that of flat cultivation in addition we found that nutrients significantly improved the production and decrease the et as a result efficiently improving the precipitation utilization and wue li and gong 2002 6 conclusion the outcome of current research work clearly recommended that grain filling rate hormonal changes dry matter yield components wue and et of maize under the rf technique were significantly higher as compared with pm and cp cultivation techniques under different nutrient strategies under the same cultivation techniques as n levels increased to 200 kg n ha 1 the soil water storage phytohormones such as iaa z zr aba content were significantly improved and reducing gas eth evolution rate which led to improve maize production as compared with control plots nitrogen applications at 300 kg ha 1 have significantly reduced soil water storage and et rate at different cultivation techniques these results indicated that under the rf3 treatment improved grain filling process wue and grain yield nitrogen applications at the rate of 300 kg ha 1 with either rf or pm cultivation techniques significantly affected hormonal changes therefore regulating the wmax gmax gmean tmax and agp of maize these finding revealed that rf3 is a new planting methods in the rain fed areas because its significantly improved sws wue total dry mater grain filling rates thus improve hormonal changes in maize grains which affected yield components and maize production future study is needed to investigate the impact of different nutrient and planting modes strategies on crops production runoff use efficiency and economic benefit under different ridge furrow ratios soil types slopes and

10929,drainage water recycling the practice of capturing and storing water drained from fields and using the stored water to irrigate crops when there is a soil water deficit has been proposed to increase the resiliency of drained agriculture but the potential benefits have not been quantified this study determined irrigation and nutrient reduction benefits of drainage water recycling for various reservoir sizes at two tile drained sites in the u s midwest with differing climates and soils field and reservoir water budgets were developed using ten years of measured tile drain flow and weather data the calculated volume of drain flow that could be captured by the reservoir was combined with measured nitrate nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations to determine nutrient load reductions at the indiana site a reservoir size representing 6 of the field area 3 05 m depth would provide water storage for meeting irrigation requirements in all ten years this reservoir would capture 37 of annual tile drain flow on average resulting in average annual load reductions of 11 kg ha 1 yr 1 37 for nitrate n and 0 05 kg ha 1 yr 1 39 for soluble reactive phosphorus at the iowa site a reservoir size of 8 was necessary to meet the irrigation requirements which were zero in most years but were higher than at the indiana site for the three years in which irrigation was needed this larger reservoir would capture 23 of annual tile drain flow on average with average annual load reductions of 9 kg ha 1 yr 1 24 for nitrate nitrogen and 0 02 kg ha 1 yr 1 21 for soluble reactive phosphorus quantifying nutrient load reductions and irrigation potential at these two sites showed that drainage water recycling is a promising practice for the tile drained landscape of the u s midwest providing a strategy to manage water related risks while also contributing to water quality goals keywords tile drainage water storage reservoir nutrient load reduction water reuse supplemental irrigation 1 introduction drained agricultural landscapes within the humid u s midwest are faced with the challenge of addressing both excess and deficit water conditions often within the same year while also minimizing negative impacts on water quality and the environment baker et al 2012 subsurface tile drainage is widespread and necessary for managing seasonal excess water in this predominantly poorly drained landscape but has also been linked to increased losses of nitrogen porter et al 2015 and phosphorus king et al 2015 from the field despite a wide range of conservation practices available to help address water quality concerns with an estimated usd 4 billion yr 1 of funding pavelis et al 2011 nutrient levels are not decreasing in rivers across the region murphy et al 2013 this suggests that new conservation innovations and approaches to managing agricultural water are needed to help address water quality concerns in this largely tile drained landscape historically less prevalent across the region than tile drainage the adoption of irrigation practices to supplement growing season rainfall and address seasonal water deficit conditions has increased by more than 28 within the u s midwest during a recent 15 year period nass 2014 1999 this growth in irrigation reflects the increasing recognition of the influence of water deficit during summer on the yield gap even in this relatively humid region and that crop sensitivity to water stress may be increasing lobell et al 2014 wang et al 2016 found that midwestern u s corn yields were negatively correlated with drought stress in the early and middle reproductive growth stages supplemental irrigation can increase average yields and reduce inter annual yield variation in this region grassini et al 2015 and adoption is expected to increase as dry periods during the growing season increase in length hatfield et al 2014 the growing prevalence of both water excess and deficit presents critical water management challenges baker et al 2012 reviewed ten years of records from federal crop insurance programs for the region and showed that indemnities paid out for corn and soybean yield losses for water related yield losses totaled usd 5 to 6 billion yr 1 and they were nearly equally divided between losses due to excess water and those due to drought this amounts to 60 to 75 of the average annual claims paid to agricultural producers during this time crs 2018 and highlights a significant opportunity for advancing integrated agricultural water management systems that combine the benefits associated with tile drainage and supplemental irrigation to reduce water related yield losses drainage water recycling dwr is the practice of capturing and storing water drained from fields in a pond reservoir or drainage ditch and using the stored water to irrigate crops when there is a soil water deficit frankenberger et al 2017 this practice has great potential to improve water quality by recovering nutrient loads that would normally be discharged from tile drains and provide supplemental irrigation to crops through increased water retention and storage in tile drained landscapes it could also reduce flood risk and lead to a more resilient landscape by dampening the impacts of fluctuating precipitation on yield and streamflow baker et al 2012 the few existing studies of drainage water recycling systems within tile drained agriculture have shown encouraging results in missouri and ohio the implementation of drainage water recycling systems increased corn grain yields between 14 to 50 and soybean yields up to 7 to 29 compared to conventional free draining and non drained treatments allred et al 2014 nelson et al 2011 nelson and smoot 2012 considerable water quality benefits have also been documented for these systems with average nitrogen reductions ranging between 40 to 70 drury et al 2009 1996 and phosphorus reductions between 12 to 36 tan and zhang 2011 tan et al 2007 similar water management systems that integrate water capture irrigation and storage have been implemented in the southern u s in the form of tailwater recovery systems prince czarnecki et al 2016 yaeger et al 2018 these systems differ from drainage water recycling in their focus on capturing and reusing runoff associated with surface irrigation practices as opposed to seasonal excess water from tile drains nonetheless research on tailwater recovery systems has highlighted the potential to capture store and reuse water from the field based on measurements of the water balance at tailwater recovery research sites omer et al 2018a estimated the water budgets for 180 constructed tailwater recovery systems in the mississippi delta and demonstrated the ability for these systems to provide reliable water supplies for irrigation by capturing and storing surface runoff resulting from precipitation and irrigation tailwater recovery has also been shown to be a valuable water quality practice reducing annual loadings of total nitrogen and total phosphorus by 34 to 44 and 43 to 89 respectively omer et al 2018b omer and baker 2018 no similar characterization of the water balance in drainage water recycling systems has been published a model enabling this characterization is needed to provide more general estimates of potential benefits of the practice beyond the handful of site specific published studies estimating water availability for irrigation and reductions in nutrient loads will allow a quantitative estimation of benefits and help to define the factors that are most likely to impact the potential benefits realized from drainage water recycling systems in tile drained landscapes of the humid u s midwest models for estimating the benefits of various sizes of irrigation reservoirs have been developed by palmer et al 1982 arnold and stockle 1991 ouyang et al 2017 and in the spaw model saxton and willey 2005 but these models focus on surface runoff as the primary water source for capture and storage due to differences in the timing and volumes of surface runoff compared to tile drainage storage relationships for drainage water recycling systems relying on tile drainage may differ from those supplied through surface runoff tile drainage patterns vary across the u s midwest and coupled with considerable variation in soils are also expected to influence storage relationships and these relationships have not been quantified although no research has been published that includes all flows of a drainage water recycling system tile drain flow has been measured at numerous sites across the midwest this study uses two of these sites each of which has daily weather tile drain flow and water table records for more than ten years along with extensive site and soil characterization data these inputs to a drainage water recycling model allow for the first estimate of nutrient loss and supplemental irrigation benefits for drainage water recycling systems in a tile drained landscape the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the amount of tile drainage that can be captured stored and utilized as supplemental irrigation by drainage water recycling systems 2 estimate the corresponding reductions in nitrate n and soluble reactive phosphorus srp loads and 3 compare results between two tile drained sites in the u s midwest with differing climates and soils results from this study will advance the understanding of the potential for dwr systems to improve water quality and crop production performance within the tile drained u s midwest and identify key research needs 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental sites this study used measured weather tile drain flow and soil characteristics data from sites in indiana eastern corn belt plains and iowa western corn belt plains for the 10 year period between 2007 and 2016 fig 1 the davis purdue agricultural center dpac in east central indiana included four tile drainage plots to evaluate hydrologic and water quality impacts between conventional free draining tile systems and controlled drainage systems detailed descriptions of the site and measurements are in saadat et al 2018a b the iowa state university southeast research farm serf is in southeast iowa and includes eight tile drainage plots to compare free draining shallow drainage controlled drainage and non drained treatments helmers et al 2012 schott et al 2017 both of these sites had more than one tile drainage treatment but only the conventional free drainage treatments were used in this study 2 1 1 soil properties soil water characteristics were collected in order to model the water balance at each site water retention at 0 0 05 0 1 0 33 and 15 bar water potential at each site was measured using hand core samples representing depth layers of 0 to 10 cm 10 to 20 cm 20 to 40 cm and 40 to 60 cm abendroth et al 2017 kladivko et al 2014 at serf water retention for soil depths greater than 20 cm was not measured for the 0 05 0 1 and 15 bar water potential and therefore was estimated using the program rosetta schaap et al 2001 because these soils do not drain freely due to a restricting layer field capacity was defined as the volumetric water content at 0 1 bar water potential reflecting the tile drain depth of approximately 1 m and following the practice in the netherlands where shallow water tables are common bouma and droogers 1999 reynolds et al 2000 soil water conditions in the field were estimated following the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 which distinguishes total available water taw in the entire soil profile and in an evaporation layer on the soil surface water conditions within the evaporation layer are defined by the total evaporable water tew which is the total amount of water that can be evaporated from the evaporation layer and readily evaporable water rew which is the portion of tew that freely evaporates from the evaporation layer under saturated conditions the soil profile depth was defined by the depth of the tile drains and the depth of the evaporation layer was assumed to be the top 10 cm of the soil profile based on allen et al 1998 taw was calculated as the difference between the average measured field capacity and wilting point 15 bar potential across sampled layers and applied to the depth of the soil profile tew was estimated as the difference between measured field capacity and one half the water content at wilting point within the 0 to 10 cm sampling depth and applied to the depth of the evaporation layer table 1 typical values of rew were obtained from allen et al 1998 based on soil texture classification 2 1 2 water table and tile drain flow water table depth and tile drain flow were measured on an hourly basis and aggregated to daily values missing data were filled using a combination of methods at dpac saadat et al 2018a used the hooghoudt equation and measured water table depth when available to estimate missing tile drain flow measurements and a linear regression relationship between replicate treatment plots otherwise at serf data gaps of less than four hours were filled using linear interpolation and larger data gaps were filled following a linear regression relationship between replicate treatment plots when replicate plot data was available at both sites remaining missing daily values dpac 1 9 of total period days serf 9 8 of total period days which occurred primarily during low flow conditions were filled using a linear regression relationship with measured precipitation average annual tile drain flow at dpac was 342 mm yr 1 range 232 to 454 mm and 301 mm yr 1 range 46 to 536 mm at serf fig 2 2 1 3 tile drain flow nutrient concentration and load nitrate n concentration of the tile drain flow was measured at each site during the 10 year study period and soluble reactive phosphorus srp concentration was measured starting in 2012 at dpac and 2011 at serf automated water samplers were utilized at dpac to collect hourly samples from tile drain flow when flow was present and combined into weekly composite samples except during the winter when weekly grab samples were collected in place of the automated samplers at serf weekly grab samples were collected directly from the tile drain when flow was present continuous daily datasets for nitrate n and srp concentrations were developed by saadat et al 2018b for dpac and by craft et al 2018 for serf for the composited samples the concentration was used for all days since the previous measurement while linear interpolation was used to estimate daily concentration between measured grab samples if no samples were taken for more than a month the average concentration for that month in other years of measurement was used daily concentration values were applied to daily tile drain flow amounts to calculate nutrient loads at each site average monthly nitrate n concentration varied between 5 4 to 13 1 mg l 1 at dpac and 9 0 to 11 6 mg l 1 at serf and nitrate n loads ranged from 0 04 to 5 2 kg ha 1 mo 1 at dpac and 0 08 to 10 1 kg ha 1 mo 1 at serf average monthly srp concentration ranged from 0 015 to 0 056 mg l 1 at dpac and 0 021 to 0 038 mg l 1 at serf and srp loads ranged from 0 001 to 0 023 kg ha 1 mo 1 at dpac and 0 001 to 0 021 kg ha 1 mo 1 at serf fig 3 2 1 4 weather data daily weather data were collected from national weather service and on site automated weather stations abendroth et al 2017 craft et al 2018 average annual rainfall was 1043 mm yr 1 range 800 to 1542 mm at dpac and 1077 mm yr 1 range 771 to 1468 mm at serf fig 2 the 30 year normal annual precipitation at the closest national weather service weather stations for dpac and serf was 1000 mm yr 1 and 927 mm yr 1 respectively arguez et al 2010 results were evaluated across dry average and wet years defined as the years most closely matching the minimum median and maximum annual and growing season precipitation amounts during the 10 year study period results from each year are provided as supplementary material 2 2 water balance model a spreadsheet model was developed using visual basic for applications in microsoft excel office 2016 to conduct daily water budgeting for the two primary components of drainage water recycling systems the reservoir and irrigated field fig 4 2 2 1 reservoir water balance the daily reservoir water volume in the reservoir was estimated based on eq 1 1 v t v t 1 p t d t i t s t e t d d t where v t 1 is the volume of water in the reservoir on the previous day p t is the precipitation volume over the surface area of the reservoir d t is the tile drain flow volume entering the reservoir from the tile drained field area i t is the amount of water withdrawn for irrigation purposes and s t e t and d d t are daily losses due to seepage evaporation from the reservoir surface and drainage discharge resulting when reservoir water volumes exceeded reservoir capacity respectively daily values for v t ranged between zero representing an empty reservoir and a maximum capacity set by a given reservoir size to summarize across a variety of reservoir sizes and shape configurations calculations of reservoir water volume were based on a reservoir with constant surface area and an average depth of 3 05 m 10 feet a range of reservoir sizes with surface areas representing 2 4 6 8 and 10 of field area were simulated to evaluate the role of storage capacity in providing water quality and irrigation benefits a seepage rate of 0 9 mm day 1 was used based on usda natural resources conservation service design standards for waste storage lagoons nrcs 2009 open water evaporation was estimated by lee 2017 using the penman monteith equation for a free water surface and daily weather data 2 2 2 field water balance a daily water balance was used to track soil water depletion in the soil layer above the tile drains based on eq 2 2 z t z t 1 p t r o t u f t i t e t c t d f t where z t 1 is the soil water depletion on the previous day p t and r o t are precipitation and runoff u f t is upward flux from a shallow groundwater table below the tile drains i t is applied irrigation e t c t is crop evapotranspiration and d f t is the downward flux of excess soil water resulting in drainage or deep percolation occurring whenever the soil profile is at or above field capacity surface runoff was estimated using the nrcs curve number approach allen et al 2007 a curve number of 65 was assumed for average antecedent soil moisture conditions which is lower than standard values for poorly drained agricultural fields nrcs 2004 to account for increased soil water storage capacity in tile drained soils the software program ref et allen 2016 was used to calculate the fao 56 penman monteith grass based reference evapotranspiration from daily weather data at each site daily crop evapotranspiration e t c t under stressed and non stressed soil water conditions was estimated following the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 growing period dates crop height and water depletion fractions were assigned based on common conditions for a corn zea mays l crop in the u s midwest and mid season basal crop coefficients were corrected for local climate conditions table 2 during the non growing season both the basal crop coefficient and fraction of living cover were set to zero to reflect the lack of growing vegetation during this period during a 30 day post harvest period tew was limited by 15 at the soil surface assuming a mulch tillage regime with 30 residue cover a 30 day pre planting period assumed bare soil conditions leading up to crop planting and total evaporative losses during this time were calculated based on a water balance for the evaporation layer following the post harvest period and prior to the pre planting period when freezing temperatures and snow cover result in violations of coefficient based approaches for estimating e t c a coefficient value of 0 44 was used as an overall average coefficient value for estimating evaporative losses during the non growing season hay and irmak 2009 a graphical example of the crop coefficient method showing the 10 year average of daily basal crop coefficient and soil evaporation coefficient at dpac is provided in the supplementary materials daily soil water deficit was calculated as the difference between soil water depletion z t and readily available water which estimates the portion of taw that can be depleted before water stress occurs irrigation scheduling followed an et based approach applying irrigation equal to the soil water deficit amount each time it exceeded a threshold of 8 mm representing the average maximum water use per day for corn irrigation application efficiency was not considered since the purpose of this study was not to evaluate irrigation approaches within dwr if the deficit amount was less than 8 mm or if the available reservoir water volume was incapable of meeting the threshold amount no irrigation was applied upward flux from a shallow or perched water table can also contribute towards meeting the crop water requirement ayars et al 2006 a relationship between water table depth and the maximum potential rate of upward flux from a shallow groundwater table was established at each site using the soil utility module in drainmod skaggs et al 2012 to estimate the amount of water that was capable of being added to the soil water balance during situations of soil water deficit fig 5 within the drainmod soil utility unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is estimated from saturated hydraulic conductivity following methods by millington and quirk 1961 and marshall 1958 the water table upward flux relationship is then calculated based on the darcy buckingham equation skaggs 1980 daily estimates of potential upward flux mm day 1 were calculated by summing the estimated hourly volumes of potential upward flux for each day based on the hourly water table measurements actual daily upward flux was assumed to be zero unless soil water deficit conditions existed and did not occur during periods when measured water table was above the depth of the tile drain if a soil water deficit persisted following any applied irrigation upward flux was added to the water balance at a volume less than or equal to the estimated daily potential upward flux based on water table observations in order to contribute towards the remaining irrigation requirement 2 3 quantifying potential water quality and irrigation benefits two types of drainage water recycling benefits were quantified using metrics selected for both absolute volumes and relative percentages table 3 irrigation benefits were quantified in absolute terms as the amount of irrigation supplied by a given reservoir size the ability of the reservoir to meet the total irrigation requirement was quantified using the annual relative irrigation supply aris index defined by malano and burton 2001 eq 3 aris index values between zero and one represent the fraction of the total irrigation requirement met by the reservoir 3 a r i s j y i j y i r y where i j y is the annual applied irrigation from a reservoir with size j during year y and i r y is the annual irrigation requirement calculated as the total irrigation that would be applied given an unlimited water supply and irrigation scheduling approach during the corresponding year water quality benefits were described in absolute terms as the reduction in tile drainage discharge and corresponding nutrient loads from the field daily tile drain flow was captured and stored if reservoir capacity was available when drainage occurred the quantity of captured tile drain flow represents the total reduction of discharged flow from the field and corresponding loads were estimated based on measured nutrient concentrations the annual percent nutrient reduction r j y of a given reservoir size and year was then calculated based on eq 4 4 r j y c j y n y where c j y is the cumulative annual captured nutrient load and n y is the cumulative annual nutrient load associated with the annual tile drain flow volume for the corresponding year 3 results 3 1 supplemental irrigation irrigation requirements occurred during each of the ten years at dpac with the total annual requirement varying between 17 and 153 mm yr 1 with a median of 110 mm yr 1 fig 6 irrigation requirements were less frequent at serf occurring in only three dry years 2011 2012 and 2013 however during these dry years the total annual irrigation requirement was greater than at dpac 111 mm yr 1 in 2011 191 mm yr 1 in 2012 and 207 mm yr 1 in 2013 reservoir water depth and availability for irrigation varied considerably throughout the growing season across the evaluated reservoir sizes as well as the annual precipitation and resulting tile drain flow amounts reservoir sizes including 2 4 and 6 of field area were drained completely during dry years at both sites and all reservoir sizes remained mostly full during wet years fig 7 during 2008 the average year at dpac larger reservoir sizes 6 8 and 10 maintained a surplus of water throughout the growing season while smaller reservoir sizes 2 and 4 were depleted to levels below what was adequate to meet the irrigation requirement while annual and growing season precipitation totals during 2014 at serf were near median values for the study period reservoir water levels were impacted by a preceding 3 year dry period where growing season precipitation was between 57 to 78 of the 10 year average combined with increased levels of irrigation requirement during this dry period all reservoir sizes at serf entered 2014 with reduced water levels deficit water stress was reduced at both sites with increasing reservoir storage size before reaching a maximum amount at reservoir sizes 6 and larger at this point any remaining water stress was minor and can be attributed to the irrigation management approach chosen for this study the minimum application threshold of 8 mm creates an allowable deficit even when there is water availability within the reservoir at dpac a reservoir size representing 6 of the field area would reduce the probability of experiencing 20 days of deficit water stress for corn from 90 to 20 fig 8 reductions in the frequency of days experiencing deficit water stress were less at serf across all reservoir sizes due to a lower frequency of irrigation requirement during the study period during dry years when irrigation was most needed the total amount of irrigation applied increased with reservoir size at both sites fig 9 the annual amount of applied irrigation at dpac increased by more than 100 mm during 2009 at dpac and 140 mm during 2012 at serf as reservoir size increased in size from 2 to 10 at dpac a reservoir of size 6 was able to supply enough water to meet the total irrigation requirement during all years with no additional irrigation benefit added from larger reservoir sizes fig 10 comparatively given the larger magnitude of irrigation requirements that occurred during dry years at serf a reservoir size of 8 was required to satisfy the irrigation requirement across all years 3 2 drainage water storage water quality benefits were quantified by the amount and percentage of tile drain flow and nutrient loads that were captured and stored by the various reservoir sizes as expected these quantities varied considerably based on the amount and timing of precipitation tile drain flow and irrigation requirements however in all scenarios evaluated the amount of captured tile drain flow increased with reservoir size the capture and accumulation of tile drain flow within the reservoir generally began earlier in the year at dpac compared to serf fig 11 during dry years at both sites the largest incremental gains in captured tile drain flow occurred as reservoir size increased from 2 to 6 the total cumulative amount of captured tile drain flow was greater at dpac during these years across reservoir sizes ranging between 4 and 10 average precipitation years at dpac showed minimal increases in captured tile drain flow between smaller reservoir sizes 2 and 4 and the largest increases occurred as reservoir size increased from 6 to 10 comparatively at serf relatively large increases in the amount of capture tile drain flow were simulated across all reservoir sizes however as mentioned in section 3 1 conditions in 2014 at serf were largely influenced by a preceding 3 year dry period which drained the reservoir for irrigation and resulted in the maximum capacity for water capture and storage when subsequent precipitation and tile drain flow occurred increases in the amount of tile drain flow captured during wet years were minimal compared to other years and largely a function of volumetric increases in reservoir size as indicated by the regularly spaced lines in fig 11 during the 10 year study period the average annual amount of captured tile drain flow varied from 54 mm yr 1 2 reservoir size to 145 mm yr 1 10 reservoir size at dpac which corresponded to between 16 and 43 of the average annual tile drain flow table 4 at serf total amounts of captured tile drain flow and percent of tile drain flow captured were lower in the majority of years evaluated with the exception being the large captured tile drain flow volumes in 2014 3 3 nutrient load reduction at both sites reductions in nutrient loads and percent reductions increased with reservoir size fig 12 at dpac the median annual load reduction varied from 5 to 10 kg ha 1 yr 1 nitrate n and 0 02 to 0 05 kg ha 1 yr 1 srp as reservoir size increased from 2 to 10 the maximum annual reductions during this time increased from 9 kg ha 1 yr 1 nitrate n and 0 05 kg ha 1 yr 1 srp at a reservoir size of 2 to 29 kg ha 1 yr 1 nitrate n and 0 1 kg ha 1 yr 1 srp given a reservoir size of 10 the average annual percent reductions ranged between 18 to 42 for nitrate n and 20 to 43 for srp at dpac lower average annual percent reductions for nitrate n 8 to 26 and srp 9 to 24 were estimated at serf the median annual load reduction varied from 1 to 5 kg ha 1 yr 1 nitrate n and 0 003 to 0 01 kg ha 1 yr 1 srp however the maximum annual load reduction in nitrate n 42 kg ha 1 yr 1 exceeded those at dpac and occurred during 2014 following an extended 3 year dry period this pattern of higher amounts of nutrient reduction following exceptionally dry conditions presents an intriguing scenario suggesting that drainage water recycling may help mitigate some of the impact from excess residual nutrients within the soil profile that go unused by crops during drought conditions an example of these abnormally high rates of nutrient loading were documented by van metre et al 2016 following the 2012 drought that impacted much of the u s midwest 4 discussion 4 1 effect of climate average annual precipitation across the study period was similar at both sites but differences in the distribution of precipitation between the growing and non growing seasons played a critical role in the timing and magnitude of irrigation and water quality benefits achieved through drainage water recycling on average 45 of the annual precipitation at dpac occurred during growing season months whereas 59 of the annual precipitation on average occurred during the growing season at serf the higher proportion of precipitation within the growing season at serf contributed to a lower frequency of irrigation requirement and higher monthly average tile drain flow during the growing season under these conditions reservoirs would fill with early spring tile drain flow and remain full throughout the growing season due to limited irrigation requirement reducing the ability to capture and store subsequent tile drain flow events at dpac where less of the annual precipitation occurred within the growing season and more frequent irrigation requirement was estimated reservoirs would fill with tile drain flow during the non growing season but water was routinely withdrawn from the reservoir during the growing season creating capacity to store subsequent tile drain flow these results suggest a positive relationship between irrigation requirement and water quality benefits where water is routinely withdrawn from the reservoir opportunities for water quality benefit are also created through increased capacity for storing future tile drain flow climate effects on irrigation and water quality benefits were compounded across years where precipitation patterns were consistently wetter or drier than average despite little to no irrigation requirement estimated for much of the study period serf experienced an extended dryer than average period between 2011 to 2013 during this time the growing season precipitation was between 57 to 78 of the 10 year average and irrigation requirements increased each year peaking at 207 mm in 2013 however higher levels of irrigation requirement during this dry period at serf served to drawdown reservoir water levels and created capacity for capturing tile drain flow and reducing nutrient loss at a much higher level than was estimated during other years the highest annual nutrient load reduction of either site by mass was estimated at serf during 2014 dpac experienced more balance between dry and wet years during the study period and as a result more consistent and higher overall average nutrient load reductions were estimated across all reservoir sizes the potential for drainage water recycling to provide irrigation and water quality benefits is expected to increase within the u s midwest as future climate is projected to be characterized by wetter non growing seasons hotter growing seasons and greater variability and magnitude of precipitation within and across years baule et al 2017 and gunn et al 2018 found that the benefits of supplemental irrigation and on farm water recycling are expected to increase under three future climate scenarios with estimated average corn and soybean yield increases between 15 to 30 and 19 to 22 respectively over non irrigated conditions 4 2 effect of soil water characteristics in conjunction with a greater proportion of precipitation falling during the growing season the deeper soils and higher water holding capacity at serf contributed to supporting crop water requirements reducing irrigation requirements and consequently water quality benefits the estimated total available water within the soil profile at serf was more than double that estimated at dpac where the soil profile can store adequate water to overcome the variability in annual and seasonal precipitation the benefits received from drainage water recycling and reservoir water storage may be reduced while soils at dpac had a lower water holding capacity the combination of a shallower tile drain depth and lower levels of hydraulic conductivity deeper in the soil profile created conditions for a shallow perched groundwater table contributing towards meeting the crop water requirement through an upward flux of water under non irrigated free draining conditions at dpac an average of 67 mm yr 1 of water through upward flux was estimated across the study period representing between 4 to 22 of the annual crop evapotranspiration given deeper tile drains at serf the depth of a shallow groundwater table is increased and the potential for upward flux is reduced during 2011 to 2013 when irrigation requirement occurred at serf an average of 14 mm yr 1 of water was supplied through upward flux representing only 2 3 of the annual crop evapotranspiration regardless results from both sites suggest that the contribution of water through upward flux from a shallow perched groundwater table can contribute towards meeting crop water requirements and may help reduce the peak magnitudes of irrigation requirement at sites 4 3 effect of reservoir size larger reservoir sizes were necessary to meet irrigation requirements during extended drought periods at dpac a reservoir size representing 6 of the field area was able to fully satisfy the irrigation requirement whereas at serf a reservoir size of 8 was required to fully meet irrigation requirements across all years a better balance between dry and wet years at dpac and greater contribution of water through upward flux from a shallow groundwater table moderated peak irrigation requirement across the study period thereby reducing the need for larger reservoir sizes at serf a 3 year period of dryer than average conditions resulted in peak levels of irrigation requirement in 2013 and required a larger reservoir however even small reservoir sizes proved to be beneficial particularly at dpac where irrigation was of lesser magnitude than peak levels estimated at serf but was more frequent small reservoirs such as those less than 6 were able to greatly reduce the number of days where crop water stress occurred at serf given the low frequency but high magnitude of irrigation requirement the benefit of these smaller reservoir sizes was less but still contributed to reducing the total number of days where deficit water stress occurred the influence of these small reservoirs at both sites is represented by the amount of area between corresponding lines in fig 8 reservoir size had a positive relationship with the magnitude of nutrient load reductions particularly maximum load reductions and extended the period of captured tile drain flow at both sites large increases in the maximum nutrient reductions for each respective reservoir size can be seen in the boxplots shown in fig 12 there was relatively little increase in average nutrient reductions across reservoir sizes above 6 compared to the increases in the upper tails of the distribution also these additional reductions occurred later in the peak tile drain flow season at each site thereby extending the period of captured tile drain flow at each site 4 4 opportunities and potential enhancements while not the primary focus of this study our results help to shed light on future opportunities and point towards potential management strategies for enhancing the benefits of drainage water recycling in tile drained landscapes extended or diversified cropping rotations such as those that incorporate cover crops into traditional corn soybean rotations double cropping and relay cropping can provide multiple benefits such as improving soil quality biological function and increase resource use efficiencies davis et al 2012 king and hofmockel 2017 however this intensification of the cropping system may also increase water requirements either through increases in individual crop water requirements such as with alfalfa garcia y garcia and strock 2018 or due to extending the active crop growing season such as with double cropping systems gesch and johnson 2015 the ability of drainage water recycling to provide both a drainage benefit and supplemental irrigation may be able to better support more intensive cropping systems and additional water use through irrigating these crops can create added capacity for capturing tile drain flow and improve the water quality benefits provided by drainage water recycling modifying irrigation scheduling and technology is likely to influence the benefits received from drainage water recycling by impacting the amount of water use for supplemental irrigation the irrigation scheduling approach used in this study may overestimate irrigated amounts compared to deficit irrigation approaches or underestimate water use for irrigation when considering less efficient systems or implementing high volume applications under a full irrigation strategy roy et al 2009 found that the optimum reservoir size for irrigation decreased when allowable depletion thresholds increased for a rainfed rice mustard cropping system due to changes in irrigation requirements temperature based thresholds may be used in place of soil water deficit thresholds as an alternative approach to irrigation scheduling and as a result can lead to different levels of irrigation water use evett et al 1996 given the importance of water use for generating the capacity for water quality benefits to occur irrigation scheduling may be used as a management tool to increase the water quality performance of drainage water recycling systems at both dpac and serf observed nutrient concentrations and loads exhibited seasonality suggesting that seasonal water level management within drainage water recycling reservoirs may be used to prioritize the capture storage and reuse of tile drain flow during times of peak concentration and tile drain flow reservoirs can also capture nutrients from surface runoff which were not quantified in this analysis omer et al 2018b found that the fullness and overall capacity of tailwater recovery systems were important predictors in the water quality performance and suggested that manipulating water levels within the system could increase performance active management of reservoir water levels within drainage water recycling reservoirs may also create opportunities for not only improving water quality but also flood control downstream particularly if implemented across a landscape scale camnasio and becciu 2011 nakanishi 2004 physical enhancement of the reservoir through practices such as the creation of shallow wetland like areas and including floating islands yeh et al 2015 may further increase the water quality performance of drainage water recycling reservoirs 4 5 research to advance drainage water recycling drainage water recycling represents a new approach to managing excess and deficit water conditions in the tile drained u s midwest and few sites have been implemented within the region this study provided needed estimates of irrigation and water quality benefits resulting from drainage water recycling and has also revealed key areas for future research to advance our understanding of this practice large capital expenses will be needed for the installation of the tile drainage irrigation and water storage infrastructure and projects will carry a life expectancy of approximately 25 to 50 years crabbé et al 2012 solomon et al 2007 given this large investment of both time and money new tools will be necessary to inform decision making by potential adopters and funders irrigation research has been relatively sparse for the u s midwest compared to more traditionally irrigated areas but will be particularly important to support economic analyses and inform irrigation management approaches suitable for providing supplemental irrigation in the region decisions tools should also be capable of evaluating both current and future climate scenarios due to the long term nature of drainage water recycling the two sites analyzed here provided some variation in soils but additional research needs to consider the variability that exists across the u s midwest soil water characteristics such as water holding capacity saturated hydraulic conductivity and the influence of upward flux from a shallow or perched water table will be critical in defining the total irrigation requirement at a site and therefore are likely to influence the potential water quality benefits of drainage water recycling direct physical measurement of these soil properties particularly the contribution of shallow groundwater to crop water requirements are not widely described for this region dyer and boisvert 1985 additional research particularly from sites which include direct physical measurement of drainage water recycling systems reinhart et al 2016 is needed in the u s midwest in order to fully evaluate the variability in benefits provided by drainage water recycling and better characterize site characteristics that influence performance research also should address water and conservation policies and programs that will need to be developed if the full suite of crop production and water quality benefits resulting from the practice are to be achieved to meet water quality objectives and provide both private and public benefits policy and financing efforts to support the costs of designing implementing and managing drainage water recycling systems will be necessary to encourage the construction of reservoirs that are larger than would be needed for irrigation benefits alone 5 conclusion this study quantified the potential irrigation and water quality benefits that can be realized from drainage water recycling systems in the tile drained u s midwest a reservoir size representing 6 of the field area can meet the irrigation requirement during all but the worst drought periods and could reduce average annual nitrate n loads by 20 to 37 and soluble reactive phosphorus loads by 17 to 39 from sites in iowa and indiana with varying climate and soils the load reductions of both nutrients show that drainage water recycling is one of the few conservation practices that can play a critical role in achieving both nitrogen and phosphorus reduction goals in this tile drained landscape there was a tight linkage between irrigation requirement and water quality benefits which highlighted the role of agricultural water use in creating capacity within drainage water recycling systems to capture and store tile drain flow and nutrients this relationship between agricultural water use and water quality point towards opportunities to further enhance the benefits received from drainage water recycling through practices that increase or diversify the use of tile drain water drainage water recycling is a promising new practice for the tile drained landscape of the u s midwest providing a strategy for agricultural producers to manage water related risks to crop production while also contributing to

10929,drainage water recycling the practice of capturing and storing water drained from fields and using the stored water to irrigate crops when there is a soil water deficit has been proposed to increase the resiliency of drained agriculture but the potential benefits have not been quantified this study determined irrigation and nutrient reduction benefits of drainage water recycling for various reservoir sizes at two tile drained sites in the u s midwest with differing climates and soils field and reservoir water budgets were developed using ten years of measured tile drain flow and weather data the calculated volume of drain flow that could be captured by the reservoir was combined with measured nitrate nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations to determine nutrient load reductions at the indiana site a reservoir size representing 6 of the field area 3 05 m depth would provide water storage for meeting irrigation requirements in all ten years this reservoir would capture 37 of annual tile drain flow on average resulting in average annual load reductions of 11 kg ha 1 yr 1 37 for nitrate n and 0 05 kg ha 1 yr 1 39 for soluble reactive phosphorus at the iowa site a reservoir size of 8 was necessary to meet the irrigation requirements which were zero in most years but were higher than at the indiana site for the three years in which irrigation was needed this larger reservoir would capture 23 of annual tile drain flow on average with average annual load reductions of 9 kg ha 1 yr 1 24 for nitrate nitrogen and 0 02 kg ha 1 yr 1 21 for soluble reactive phosphorus quantifying nutrient load reductions and irrigation potential at these two sites showed that drainage water recycling is a promising practice for the tile drained landscape of the u s midwest providing a strategy to manage water related risks while also contributing to water quality goals keywords tile drainage water storage reservoir nutrient load reduction water reuse supplemental irrigation 1 introduction drained agricultural landscapes within the humid u s midwest are faced with the challenge of addressing both excess and deficit water conditions often within the same year while also minimizing negative impacts on water quality and the environment baker et al 2012 subsurface tile drainage is widespread and necessary for managing seasonal excess water in this predominantly poorly drained landscape but has also been linked to increased losses of nitrogen porter et al 2015 and phosphorus king et al 2015 from the field despite a wide range of conservation practices available to help address water quality concerns with an estimated usd 4 billion yr 1 of funding pavelis et al 2011 nutrient levels are not decreasing in rivers across the region murphy et al 2013 this suggests that new conservation innovations and approaches to managing agricultural water are needed to help address water quality concerns in this largely tile drained landscape historically less prevalent across the region than tile drainage the adoption of irrigation practices to supplement growing season rainfall and address seasonal water deficit conditions has increased by more than 28 within the u s midwest during a recent 15 year period nass 2014 1999 this growth in irrigation reflects the increasing recognition of the influence of water deficit during summer on the yield gap even in this relatively humid region and that crop sensitivity to water stress may be increasing lobell et al 2014 wang et al 2016 found that midwestern u s corn yields were negatively correlated with drought stress in the early and middle reproductive growth stages supplemental irrigation can increase average yields and reduce inter annual yield variation in this region grassini et al 2015 and adoption is expected to increase as dry periods during the growing season increase in length hatfield et al 2014 the growing prevalence of both water excess and deficit presents critical water management challenges baker et al 2012 reviewed ten years of records from federal crop insurance programs for the region and showed that indemnities paid out for corn and soybean yield losses for water related yield losses totaled usd 5 to 6 billion yr 1 and they were nearly equally divided between losses due to excess water and those due to drought this amounts to 60 to 75 of the average annual claims paid to agricultural producers during this time crs 2018 and highlights a significant opportunity for advancing integrated agricultural water management systems that combine the benefits associated with tile drainage and supplemental irrigation to reduce water related yield losses drainage water recycling dwr is the practice of capturing and storing water drained from fields in a pond reservoir or drainage ditch and using the stored water to irrigate crops when there is a soil water deficit frankenberger et al 2017 this practice has great potential to improve water quality by recovering nutrient loads that would normally be discharged from tile drains and provide supplemental irrigation to crops through increased water retention and storage in tile drained landscapes it could also reduce flood risk and lead to a more resilient landscape by dampening the impacts of fluctuating precipitation on yield and streamflow baker et al 2012 the few existing studies of drainage water recycling systems within tile drained agriculture have shown encouraging results in missouri and ohio the implementation of drainage water recycling systems increased corn grain yields between 14 to 50 and soybean yields up to 7 to 29 compared to conventional free draining and non drained treatments allred et al 2014 nelson et al 2011 nelson and smoot 2012 considerable water quality benefits have also been documented for these systems with average nitrogen reductions ranging between 40 to 70 drury et al 2009 1996 and phosphorus reductions between 12 to 36 tan and zhang 2011 tan et al 2007 similar water management systems that integrate water capture irrigation and storage have been implemented in the southern u s in the form of tailwater recovery systems prince czarnecki et al 2016 yaeger et al 2018 these systems differ from drainage water recycling in their focus on capturing and reusing runoff associated with surface irrigation practices as opposed to seasonal excess water from tile drains nonetheless research on tailwater recovery systems has highlighted the potential to capture store and reuse water from the field based on measurements of the water balance at tailwater recovery research sites omer et al 2018a estimated the water budgets for 180 constructed tailwater recovery systems in the mississippi delta and demonstrated the ability for these systems to provide reliable water supplies for irrigation by capturing and storing surface runoff resulting from precipitation and irrigation tailwater recovery has also been shown to be a valuable water quality practice reducing annual loadings of total nitrogen and total phosphorus by 34 to 44 and 43 to 89 respectively omer et al 2018b omer and baker 2018 no similar characterization of the water balance in drainage water recycling systems has been published a model enabling this characterization is needed to provide more general estimates of potential benefits of the practice beyond the handful of site specific published studies estimating water availability for irrigation and reductions in nutrient loads will allow a quantitative estimation of benefits and help to define the factors that are most likely to impact the potential benefits realized from drainage water recycling systems in tile drained landscapes of the humid u s midwest models for estimating the benefits of various sizes of irrigation reservoirs have been developed by palmer et al 1982 arnold and stockle 1991 ouyang et al 2017 and in the spaw model saxton and willey 2005 but these models focus on surface runoff as the primary water source for capture and storage due to differences in the timing and volumes of surface runoff compared to tile drainage storage relationships for drainage water recycling systems relying on tile drainage may differ from those supplied through surface runoff tile drainage patterns vary across the u s midwest and coupled with considerable variation in soils are also expected to influence storage relationships and these relationships have not been quantified although no research has been published that includes all flows of a drainage water recycling system tile drain flow has been measured at numerous sites across the midwest this study uses two of these sites each of which has daily weather tile drain flow and water table records for more than ten years along with extensive site and soil characterization data these inputs to a drainage water recycling model allow for the first estimate of nutrient loss and supplemental irrigation benefits for drainage water recycling systems in a tile drained landscape the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the amount of tile drainage that can be captured stored and utilized as supplemental irrigation by drainage water recycling systems 2 estimate the corresponding reductions in nitrate n and soluble reactive phosphorus srp loads and 3 compare results between two tile drained sites in the u s midwest with differing climates and soils results from this study will advance the understanding of the potential for dwr systems to improve water quality and crop production performance within the tile drained u s midwest and identify key research needs 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental sites this study used measured weather tile drain flow and soil characteristics data from sites in indiana eastern corn belt plains and iowa western corn belt plains for the 10 year period between 2007 and 2016 fig 1 the davis purdue agricultural center dpac in east central indiana included four tile drainage plots to evaluate hydrologic and water quality impacts between conventional free draining tile systems and controlled drainage systems detailed descriptions of the site and measurements are in saadat et al 2018a b the iowa state university southeast research farm serf is in southeast iowa and includes eight tile drainage plots to compare free draining shallow drainage controlled drainage and non drained treatments helmers et al 2012 schott et al 2017 both of these sites had more than one tile drainage treatment but only the conventional free drainage treatments were used in this study 2 1 1 soil properties soil water characteristics were collected in order to model the water balance at each site water retention at 0 0 05 0 1 0 33 and 15 bar water potential at each site was measured using hand core samples representing depth layers of 0 to 10 cm 10 to 20 cm 20 to 40 cm and 40 to 60 cm abendroth et al 2017 kladivko et al 2014 at serf water retention for soil depths greater than 20 cm was not measured for the 0 05 0 1 and 15 bar water potential and therefore was estimated using the program rosetta schaap et al 2001 because these soils do not drain freely due to a restricting layer field capacity was defined as the volumetric water content at 0 1 bar water potential reflecting the tile drain depth of approximately 1 m and following the practice in the netherlands where shallow water tables are common bouma and droogers 1999 reynolds et al 2000 soil water conditions in the field were estimated following the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 which distinguishes total available water taw in the entire soil profile and in an evaporation layer on the soil surface water conditions within the evaporation layer are defined by the total evaporable water tew which is the total amount of water that can be evaporated from the evaporation layer and readily evaporable water rew which is the portion of tew that freely evaporates from the evaporation layer under saturated conditions the soil profile depth was defined by the depth of the tile drains and the depth of the evaporation layer was assumed to be the top 10 cm of the soil profile based on allen et al 1998 taw was calculated as the difference between the average measured field capacity and wilting point 15 bar potential across sampled layers and applied to the depth of the soil profile tew was estimated as the difference between measured field capacity and one half the water content at wilting point within the 0 to 10 cm sampling depth and applied to the depth of the evaporation layer table 1 typical values of rew were obtained from allen et al 1998 based on soil texture classification 2 1 2 water table and tile drain flow water table depth and tile drain flow were measured on an hourly basis and aggregated to daily values missing data were filled using a combination of methods at dpac saadat et al 2018a used the hooghoudt equation and measured water table depth when available to estimate missing tile drain flow measurements and a linear regression relationship between replicate treatment plots otherwise at serf data gaps of less than four hours were filled using linear interpolation and larger data gaps were filled following a linear regression relationship between replicate treatment plots when replicate plot data was available at both sites remaining missing daily values dpac 1 9 of total period days serf 9 8 of total period days which occurred primarily during low flow conditions were filled using a linear regression relationship with measured precipitation average annual tile drain flow at dpac was 342 mm yr 1 range 232 to 454 mm and 301 mm yr 1 range 46 to 536 mm at serf fig 2 2 1 3 tile drain flow nutrient concentration and load nitrate n concentration of the tile drain flow was measured at each site during the 10 year study period and soluble reactive phosphorus srp concentration was measured starting in 2012 at dpac and 2011 at serf automated water samplers were utilized at dpac to collect hourly samples from tile drain flow when flow was present and combined into weekly composite samples except during the winter when weekly grab samples were collected in place of the automated samplers at serf weekly grab samples were collected directly from the tile drain when flow was present continuous daily datasets for nitrate n and srp concentrations were developed by saadat et al 2018b for dpac and by craft et al 2018 for serf for the composited samples the concentration was used for all days since the previous measurement while linear interpolation was used to estimate daily concentration between measured grab samples if no samples were taken for more than a month the average concentration for that month in other years of measurement was used daily concentration values were applied to daily tile drain flow amounts to calculate nutrient loads at each site average monthly nitrate n concentration varied between 5 4 to 13 1 mg l 1 at dpac and 9 0 to 11 6 mg l 1 at serf and nitrate n loads ranged from 0 04 to 5 2 kg ha 1 mo 1 at dpac and 0 08 to 10 1 kg ha 1 mo 1 at serf average monthly srp concentration ranged from 0 015 to 0 056 mg l 1 at dpac and 0 021 to 0 038 mg l 1 at serf and srp loads ranged from 0 001 to 0 023 kg ha 1 mo 1 at dpac and 0 001 to 0 021 kg ha 1 mo 1 at serf fig 3 2 1 4 weather data daily weather data were collected from national weather service and on site automated weather stations abendroth et al 2017 craft et al 2018 average annual rainfall was 1043 mm yr 1 range 800 to 1542 mm at dpac and 1077 mm yr 1 range 771 to 1468 mm at serf fig 2 the 30 year normal annual precipitation at the closest national weather service weather stations for dpac and serf was 1000 mm yr 1 and 927 mm yr 1 respectively arguez et al 2010 results were evaluated across dry average and wet years defined as the years most closely matching the minimum median and maximum annual and growing season precipitation amounts during the 10 year study period results from each year are provided as supplementary material 2 2 water balance model a spreadsheet model was developed using visual basic for applications in microsoft excel office 2016 to conduct daily water budgeting for the two primary components of drainage water recycling systems the reservoir and irrigated field fig 4 2 2 1 reservoir water balance the daily reservoir water volume in the reservoir was estimated based on eq 1 1 v t v t 1 p t d t i t s t e t d d t where v t 1 is the volume of water in the reservoir on the previous day p t is the precipitation volume over the surface area of the reservoir d t is the tile drain flow volume entering the reservoir from the tile drained field area i t is the amount of water withdrawn for irrigation purposes and s t e t and d d t are daily losses due to seepage evaporation from the reservoir surface and drainage discharge resulting when reservoir water volumes exceeded reservoir capacity respectively daily values for v t ranged between zero representing an empty reservoir and a maximum capacity set by a given reservoir size to summarize across a variety of reservoir sizes and shape configurations calculations of reservoir water volume were based on a reservoir with constant surface area and an average depth of 3 05 m 10 feet a range of reservoir sizes with surface areas representing 2 4 6 8 and 10 of field area were simulated to evaluate the role of storage capacity in providing water quality and irrigation benefits a seepage rate of 0 9 mm day 1 was used based on usda natural resources conservation service design standards for waste storage lagoons nrcs 2009 open water evaporation was estimated by lee 2017 using the penman monteith equation for a free water surface and daily weather data 2 2 2 field water balance a daily water balance was used to track soil water depletion in the soil layer above the tile drains based on eq 2 2 z t z t 1 p t r o t u f t i t e t c t d f t where z t 1 is the soil water depletion on the previous day p t and r o t are precipitation and runoff u f t is upward flux from a shallow groundwater table below the tile drains i t is applied irrigation e t c t is crop evapotranspiration and d f t is the downward flux of excess soil water resulting in drainage or deep percolation occurring whenever the soil profile is at or above field capacity surface runoff was estimated using the nrcs curve number approach allen et al 2007 a curve number of 65 was assumed for average antecedent soil moisture conditions which is lower than standard values for poorly drained agricultural fields nrcs 2004 to account for increased soil water storage capacity in tile drained soils the software program ref et allen 2016 was used to calculate the fao 56 penman monteith grass based reference evapotranspiration from daily weather data at each site daily crop evapotranspiration e t c t under stressed and non stressed soil water conditions was estimated following the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 growing period dates crop height and water depletion fractions were assigned based on common conditions for a corn zea mays l crop in the u s midwest and mid season basal crop coefficients were corrected for local climate conditions table 2 during the non growing season both the basal crop coefficient and fraction of living cover were set to zero to reflect the lack of growing vegetation during this period during a 30 day post harvest period tew was limited by 15 at the soil surface assuming a mulch tillage regime with 30 residue cover a 30 day pre planting period assumed bare soil conditions leading up to crop planting and total evaporative losses during this time were calculated based on a water balance for the evaporation layer following the post harvest period and prior to the pre planting period when freezing temperatures and snow cover result in violations of coefficient based approaches for estimating e t c a coefficient value of 0 44 was used as an overall average coefficient value for estimating evaporative losses during the non growing season hay and irmak 2009 a graphical example of the crop coefficient method showing the 10 year average of daily basal crop coefficient and soil evaporation coefficient at dpac is provided in the supplementary materials daily soil water deficit was calculated as the difference between soil water depletion z t and readily available water which estimates the portion of taw that can be depleted before water stress occurs irrigation scheduling followed an et based approach applying irrigation equal to the soil water deficit amount each time it exceeded a threshold of 8 mm representing the average maximum water use per day for corn irrigation application efficiency was not considered since the purpose of this study was not to evaluate irrigation approaches within dwr if the deficit amount was less than 8 mm or if the available reservoir water volume was incapable of meeting the threshold amount no irrigation was applied upward flux from a shallow or perched water table can also contribute towards meeting the crop water requirement ayars et al 2006 a relationship between water table depth and the maximum potential rate of upward flux from a shallow groundwater table was established at each site using the soil utility module in drainmod skaggs et al 2012 to estimate the amount of water that was capable of being added to the soil water balance during situations of soil water deficit fig 5 within the drainmod soil utility unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is estimated from saturated hydraulic conductivity following methods by millington and quirk 1961 and marshall 1958 the water table upward flux relationship is then calculated based on the darcy buckingham equation skaggs 1980 daily estimates of potential upward flux mm day 1 were calculated by summing the estimated hourly volumes of potential upward flux for each day based on the hourly water table measurements actual daily upward flux was assumed to be zero unless soil water deficit conditions existed and did not occur during periods when measured water table was above the depth of the tile drain if a soil water deficit persisted following any applied irrigation upward flux was added to the water balance at a volume less than or equal to the estimated daily potential upward flux based on water table observations in order to contribute towards the remaining irrigation requirement 2 3 quantifying potential water quality and irrigation benefits two types of drainage water recycling benefits were quantified using metrics selected for both absolute volumes and relative percentages table 3 irrigation benefits were quantified in absolute terms as the amount of irrigation supplied by a given reservoir size the ability of the reservoir to meet the total irrigation requirement was quantified using the annual relative irrigation supply aris index defined by malano and burton 2001 eq 3 aris index values between zero and one represent the fraction of the total irrigation requirement met by the reservoir 3 a r i s j y i j y i r y where i j y is the annual applied irrigation from a reservoir with size j during year y and i r y is the annual irrigation requirement calculated as the total irrigation that would be applied given an unlimited water supply and irrigation scheduling approach during the corresponding year water quality benefits were described in absolute terms as the reduction in tile drainage discharge and corresponding nutrient loads from the field daily tile drain flow was captured and stored if reservoir capacity was available when drainage occurred the quantity of captured tile drain flow represents the total reduction of discharged flow from the field and corresponding loads were estimated based on measured nutrient concentrations the annual percent nutrient reduction r j y of a given reservoir size and year was then calculated based on eq 4 4 r j y c j y n y where c j y is the cumulative annual captured nutrient load and n y is the cumulative annual nutrient load associated with the annual tile drain flow volume for the corresponding year 3 results 3 1 supplemental irrigation irrigation requirements occurred during each of the ten years at dpac with the total annual requirement varying between 17 and 153 mm yr 1 with a median of 110 mm yr 1 fig 6 irrigation requirements were less frequent at serf occurring in only three dry years 2011 2012 and 2013 however during these dry years the total annual irrigation requirement was greater than at dpac 111 mm yr 1 in 2011 191 mm yr 1 in 2012 and 207 mm yr 1 in 2013 reservoir water depth and availability for irrigation varied considerably throughout the growing season across the evaluated reservoir sizes as well as the annual precipitation and resulting tile drain flow amounts reservoir sizes including 2 4 and 6 of field area were drained completely during dry years at both sites and all reservoir sizes remained mostly full during wet years fig 7 during 2008 the average year at dpac larger reservoir sizes 6 8 and 10 maintained a surplus of water throughout the growing season while smaller reservoir sizes 2 and 4 were depleted to levels below what was adequate to meet the irrigation requirement while annual and growing season precipitation totals during 2014 at serf were near median values for the study period reservoir water levels were impacted by a preceding 3 year dry period where growing season precipitation was between 57 to 78 of the 10 year average combined with increased levels of irrigation requirement during this dry period all reservoir sizes at serf entered 2014 with reduced water levels deficit water stress was reduced at both sites with increasing reservoir storage size before reaching a maximum amount at reservoir sizes 6 and larger at this point any remaining water stress was minor and can be attributed to the irrigation management approach chosen for this study the minimum application threshold of 8 mm creates an allowable deficit even when there is water availability within the reservoir at dpac a reservoir size representing 6 of the field area would reduce the probability of experiencing 20 days of deficit water stress for corn from 90 to 20 fig 8 reductions in the frequency of days experiencing deficit water stress were less at serf across all reservoir sizes due to a lower frequency of irrigation requirement during the study period during dry years when irrigation was most needed the total amount of irrigation applied increased with reservoir size at both sites fig 9 the annual amount of applied irrigation at dpac increased by more than 100 mm during 2009 at dpac and 140 mm during 2012 at serf as reservoir size increased in size from 2 to 10 at dpac a reservoir of size 6 was able to supply enough water to meet the total irrigation requirement during all years with no additional irrigation benefit added from larger reservoir sizes fig 10 comparatively given the larger magnitude of irrigation requirements that occurred during dry years at serf a reservoir size of 8 was required to satisfy the irrigation requirement across all years 3 2 drainage water storage water quality benefits were quantified by the amount and percentage of tile drain flow and nutrient loads that were captured and stored by the various reservoir sizes as expected these quantities varied considerably based on the amount and timing of precipitation tile drain flow and irrigation requirements however in all scenarios evaluated the amount of captured tile drain flow increased with reservoir size the capture and accumulation of tile drain flow within the reservoir generally began earlier in the year at dpac compared to serf fig 11 during dry years at both sites the largest incremental gains in captured tile drain flow occurred as reservoir size increased from 2 to 6 the total cumulative amount of captured tile drain flow was greater at dpac during these years across reservoir sizes ranging between 4 and 10 average precipitation years at dpac showed minimal increases in captured tile drain flow between smaller reservoir sizes 2 and 4 and the largest increases occurred as reservoir size increased from 6 to 10 comparatively at serf relatively large increases in the amount of capture tile drain flow were simulated across all reservoir sizes however as mentioned in section 3 1 conditions in 2014 at serf were largely influenced by a preceding 3 year dry period which drained the reservoir for irrigation and resulted in the maximum capacity for water capture and storage when subsequent precipitation and tile drain flow occurred increases in the amount of tile drain flow captured during wet years were minimal compared to other years and largely a function of volumetric increases in reservoir size as indicated by the regularly spaced lines in fig 11 during the 10 year study period the average annual amount of captured tile drain flow varied from 54 mm yr 1 2 reservoir size to 145 mm yr 1 10 reservoir size at dpac which corresponded to between 16 and 43 of the average annual tile drain flow table 4 at serf total amounts of captured tile drain flow and percent of tile drain flow captured were lower in the majority of years evaluated with the exception being the large captured tile drain flow volumes in 2014 3 3 nutrient load reduction at both sites reductions in nutrient loads and percent reductions increased with reservoir size fig 12 at dpac the median annual load reduction varied from 5 to 10 kg ha 1 yr 1 nitrate n and 0 02 to 0 05 kg ha 1 yr 1 srp as reservoir size increased from 2 to 10 the maximum annual reductions during this time increased from 9 kg ha 1 yr 1 nitrate n and 0 05 kg ha 1 yr 1 srp at a reservoir size of 2 to 29 kg ha 1 yr 1 nitrate n and 0 1 kg ha 1 yr 1 srp given a reservoir size of 10 the average annual percent reductions ranged between 18 to 42 for nitrate n and 20 to 43 for srp at dpac lower average annual percent reductions for nitrate n 8 to 26 and srp 9 to 24 were estimated at serf the median annual load reduction varied from 1 to 5 kg ha 1 yr 1 nitrate n and 0 003 to 0 01 kg ha 1 yr 1 srp however the maximum annual load reduction in nitrate n 42 kg ha 1 yr 1 exceeded those at dpac and occurred during 2014 following an extended 3 year dry period this pattern of higher amounts of nutrient reduction following exceptionally dry conditions presents an intriguing scenario suggesting that drainage water recycling may help mitigate some of the impact from excess residual nutrients within the soil profile that go unused by crops during drought conditions an example of these abnormally high rates of nutrient loading were documented by van metre et al 2016 following the 2012 drought that impacted much of the u s midwest 4 discussion 4 1 effect of climate average annual precipitation across the study period was similar at both sites but differences in the distribution of precipitation between the growing and non growing seasons played a critical role in the timing and magnitude of irrigation and water quality benefits achieved through drainage water recycling on average 45 of the annual precipitation at dpac occurred during growing season months whereas 59 of the annual precipitation on average occurred during the growing season at serf the higher proportion of precipitation within the growing season at serf contributed to a lower frequency of irrigation requirement and higher monthly average tile drain flow during the growing season under these conditions reservoirs would fill with early spring tile drain flow and remain full throughout the growing season due to limited irrigation requirement reducing the ability to capture and store subsequent tile drain flow events at dpac where less of the annual precipitation occurred within the growing season and more frequent irrigation requirement was estimated reservoirs would fill with tile drain flow during the non growing season but water was routinely withdrawn from the reservoir during the growing season creating capacity to store subsequent tile drain flow these results suggest a positive relationship between irrigation requirement and water quality benefits where water is routinely withdrawn from the reservoir opportunities for water quality benefit are also created through increased capacity for storing future tile drain flow climate effects on irrigation and water quality benefits were compounded across years where precipitation patterns were consistently wetter or drier than average despite little to no irrigation requirement estimated for much of the study period serf experienced an extended dryer than average period between 2011 to 2013 during this time the growing season precipitation was between 57 to 78 of the 10 year average and irrigation requirements increased each year peaking at 207 mm in 2013 however higher levels of irrigation requirement during this dry period at serf served to drawdown reservoir water levels and created capacity for capturing tile drain flow and reducing nutrient loss at a much higher level than was estimated during other years the highest annual nutrient load reduction of either site by mass was estimated at serf during 2014 dpac experienced more balance between dry and wet years during the study period and as a result more consistent and higher overall average nutrient load reductions were estimated across all reservoir sizes the potential for drainage water recycling to provide irrigation and water quality benefits is expected to increase within the u s midwest as future climate is projected to be characterized by wetter non growing seasons hotter growing seasons and greater variability and magnitude of precipitation within and across years baule et al 2017 and gunn et al 2018 found that the benefits of supplemental irrigation and on farm water recycling are expected to increase under three future climate scenarios with estimated average corn and soybean yield increases between 15 to 30 and 19 to 22 respectively over non irrigated conditions 4 2 effect of soil water characteristics in conjunction with a greater proportion of precipitation falling during the growing season the deeper soils and higher water holding capacity at serf contributed to supporting crop water requirements reducing irrigation requirements and consequently water quality benefits the estimated total available water within the soil profile at serf was more than double that estimated at dpac where the soil profile can store adequate water to overcome the variability in annual and seasonal precipitation the benefits received from drainage water recycling and reservoir water storage may be reduced while soils at dpac had a lower water holding capacity the combination of a shallower tile drain depth and lower levels of hydraulic conductivity deeper in the soil profile created conditions for a shallow perched groundwater table contributing towards meeting the crop water requirement through an upward flux of water under non irrigated free draining conditions at dpac an average of 67 mm yr 1 of water through upward flux was estimated across the study period representing between 4 to 22 of the annual crop evapotranspiration given deeper tile drains at serf the depth of a shallow groundwater table is increased and the potential for upward flux is reduced during 2011 to 2013 when irrigation requirement occurred at serf an average of 14 mm yr 1 of water was supplied through upward flux representing only 2 3 of the annual crop evapotranspiration regardless results from both sites suggest that the contribution of water through upward flux from a shallow perched groundwater table can contribute towards meeting crop water requirements and may help reduce the peak magnitudes of irrigation requirement at sites 4 3 effect of reservoir size larger reservoir sizes were necessary to meet irrigation requirements during extended drought periods at dpac a reservoir size representing 6 of the field area was able to fully satisfy the irrigation requirement whereas at serf a reservoir size of 8 was required to fully meet irrigation requirements across all years a better balance between dry and wet years at dpac and greater contribution of water through upward flux from a shallow groundwater table moderated peak irrigation requirement across the study period thereby reducing the need for larger reservoir sizes at serf a 3 year period of dryer than average conditions resulted in peak levels of irrigation requirement in 2013 and required a larger reservoir however even small reservoir sizes proved to be beneficial particularly at dpac where irrigation was of lesser magnitude than peak levels estimated at serf but was more frequent small reservoirs such as those less than 6 were able to greatly reduce the number of days where crop water stress occurred at serf given the low frequency but high magnitude of irrigation requirement the benefit of these smaller reservoir sizes was less but still contributed to reducing the total number of days where deficit water stress occurred the influence of these small reservoirs at both sites is represented by the amount of area between corresponding lines in fig 8 reservoir size had a positive relationship with the magnitude of nutrient load reductions particularly maximum load reductions and extended the period of captured tile drain flow at both sites large increases in the maximum nutrient reductions for each respective reservoir size can be seen in the boxplots shown in fig 12 there was relatively little increase in average nutrient reductions across reservoir sizes above 6 compared to the increases in the upper tails of the distribution also these additional reductions occurred later in the peak tile drain flow season at each site thereby extending the period of captured tile drain flow at each site 4 4 opportunities and potential enhancements while not the primary focus of this study our results help to shed light on future opportunities and point towards potential management strategies for enhancing the benefits of drainage water recycling in tile drained landscapes extended or diversified cropping rotations such as those that incorporate cover crops into traditional corn soybean rotations double cropping and relay cropping can provide multiple benefits such as improving soil quality biological function and increase resource use efficiencies davis et al 2012 king and hofmockel 2017 however this intensification of the cropping system may also increase water requirements either through increases in individual crop water requirements such as with alfalfa garcia y garcia and strock 2018 or due to extending the active crop growing season such as with double cropping systems gesch and johnson 2015 the ability of drainage water recycling to provide both a drainage benefit and supplemental irrigation may be able to better support more intensive cropping systems and additional water use through irrigating these crops can create added capacity for capturing tile drain flow and improve the water quality benefits provided by drainage water recycling modifying irrigation scheduling and technology is likely to influence the benefits received from drainage water recycling by impacting the amount of water use for supplemental irrigation the irrigation scheduling approach used in this study may overestimate irrigated amounts compared to deficit irrigation approaches or underestimate water use for irrigation when considering less efficient systems or implementing high volume applications under a full irrigation strategy roy et al 2009 found that the optimum reservoir size for irrigation decreased when allowable depletion thresholds increased for a rainfed rice mustard cropping system due to changes in irrigation requirements temperature based thresholds may be used in place of soil water deficit thresholds as an alternative approach to irrigation scheduling and as a result can lead to different levels of irrigation water use evett et al 1996 given the importance of water use for generating the capacity for water quality benefits to occur irrigation scheduling may be used as a management tool to increase the water quality performance of drainage water recycling systems at both dpac and serf observed nutrient concentrations and loads exhibited seasonality suggesting that seasonal water level management within drainage water recycling reservoirs may be used to prioritize the capture storage and reuse of tile drain flow during times of peak concentration and tile drain flow reservoirs can also capture nutrients from surface runoff which were not quantified in this analysis omer et al 2018b found that the fullness and overall capacity of tailwater recovery systems were important predictors in the water quality performance and suggested that manipulating water levels within the system could increase performance active management of reservoir water levels within drainage water recycling reservoirs may also create opportunities for not only improving water quality but also flood control downstream particularly if implemented across a landscape scale camnasio and becciu 2011 nakanishi 2004 physical enhancement of the reservoir through practices such as the creation of shallow wetland like areas and including floating islands yeh et al 2015 may further increase the water quality performance of drainage water recycling reservoirs 4 5 research to advance drainage water recycling drainage water recycling represents a new approach to managing excess and deficit water conditions in the tile drained u s midwest and few sites have been implemented within the region this study provided needed estimates of irrigation and water quality benefits resulting from drainage water recycling and has also revealed key areas for future research to advance our understanding of this practice large capital expenses will be needed for the installation of the tile drainage irrigation and water storage infrastructure and projects will carry a life expectancy of approximately 25 to 50 years crabbé et al 2012 solomon et al 2007 given this large investment of both time and money new tools will be necessary to inform decision making by potential adopters and funders irrigation research has been relatively sparse for the u s midwest compared to more traditionally irrigated areas but will be particularly important to support economic analyses and inform irrigation management approaches suitable for providing supplemental irrigation in the region decisions tools should also be capable of evaluating both current and future climate scenarios due to the long term nature of drainage water recycling the two sites analyzed here provided some variation in soils but additional research needs to consider the variability that exists across the u s midwest soil water characteristics such as water holding capacity saturated hydraulic conductivity and the influence of upward flux from a shallow or perched water table will be critical in defining the total irrigation requirement at a site and therefore are likely to influence the potential water quality benefits of drainage water recycling direct physical measurement of these soil properties particularly the contribution of shallow groundwater to crop water requirements are not widely described for this region dyer and boisvert 1985 additional research particularly from sites which include direct physical measurement of drainage water recycling systems reinhart et al 2016 is needed in the u s midwest in order to fully evaluate the variability in benefits provided by drainage water recycling and better characterize site characteristics that influence performance research also should address water and conservation policies and programs that will need to be developed if the full suite of crop production and water quality benefits resulting from the practice are to be achieved to meet water quality objectives and provide both private and public benefits policy and financing efforts to support the costs of designing implementing and managing drainage water recycling systems will be necessary to encourage the construction of reservoirs that are larger than would be needed for irrigation benefits alone 5 conclusion this study quantified the potential irrigation and water quality benefits that can be realized from drainage water recycling systems in the tile drained u s midwest a reservoir size representing 6 of the field area can meet the irrigation requirement during all but the worst drought periods and could reduce average annual nitrate n loads by 20 to 37 and soluble reactive phosphorus loads by 17 to 39 from sites in iowa and indiana with varying climate and soils the load reductions of both nutrients show that drainage water recycling is one of the few conservation practices that can play a critical role in achieving both nitrogen and phosphorus reduction goals in this tile drained landscape there was a tight linkage between irrigation requirement and water quality benefits which highlighted the role of agricultural water use in creating capacity within drainage water recycling systems to capture and store tile drain flow and nutrients this relationship between agricultural water use and water quality point towards opportunities to further enhance the benefits received from drainage water recycling through practices that increase or diversify the use of tile drain water drainage water recycling is a promising new practice for the tile drained landscape of the u s midwest providing a strategy for agricultural producers to manage water related risks to crop production while also contributing to water quality goals associated with both nitrate n and srp loss declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this material is based upon work that is supported by the national institute of
