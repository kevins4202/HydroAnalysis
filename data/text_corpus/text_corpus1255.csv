6275,debris is known to influence the ablation topography and hydrological systems of glaciers this paper determines for the first time how these influences impact on bulk water routing and the proglacial runoff signal using analyses of supraglacial and proglacial water chemistry and proglacial discharge at miage glacier italian alps debris does influence the supraglacial water chemistry but the inefficient subglacial system beneath the debris covered zone also plays a role in increasing the ion contribution to the proglacial stream daily hydrographs had a lower amplitude and later discharge peak compared to clean glaciers and fewer diurnal hydrographs were found compared to similar analysis for haut glacier d arolla we attribute these observations to the attenuating effect of the debris on ablation smaller input streams on the debris covered area a less efficient subglacial system and possible leakage into a raised sediment bed beneath the glacier strongly diurnal hydrographs are constrained to periods with warmer than average conditions average weather conditions result in a hydrograph with reverse asymmetry conductivity and discharge commonly show anti clockwise hysteresis suggesting the more dilute rapidly routed melt component from the mid glacier peaks before the discharge peak with components from higher up glacier and the debris covered areas arriving later at the proglacial stream the results of this study could lead to a greater understanding of the hydrological structure of other debris covered glaciers with findings highlighting the need to include the influence of the debris cover within future models of debris covered glacier runoff keywords debris covered glaciers glacier hydrology proglacial discharge suspended sediment concentration glacier hydrochemistry 1 introduction glacial melt is an important component of downstream runoff especially during dry seasons maurya et al 2011 xu et al 2009 understanding the runoff hydrograph is important for water resources management for example for irrigation e g in the tien shan region of china wang et al 2014 and the development of hydropower projects e g in the indian himalaya srivastava et al 2014 there is a need to provide a more complete assessment of how glacier retreat may impact on hydropower revenues milner et al 2017 the diurnal amplitude of runoff from clean glaciers is expected to increase and the lag time to peak runoff to decrease in a warmer climate as the snowpack has a progressively smaller hydrological influence escher vetter and reinwarth 1994 however given the likely increase in debris cover on alpine glaciers stokes et al 2007 and the widespread occurrence of debris covered glaciers in high mountain regions scherler et al 2018 projections of runoff hydrographs need to include debris cover effects debris covered glaciers are especially common in the pamirs and himalaya bolch et al 2012 scherler et al 2011 caucasus mountains russia stokes et al 2007 and the western alps deline et al 2012 with the extent and thickness of debris cover increasing in many areas bhambri et al 2011 bolch et al 2008 kirkbride and deline 2013 lambrecht et al 2011 supraglacial debris cover reduces melt compared to bare ice except where the cover is thin or discontinuous kirkbride and dugmore 2003 mattson et al 1993 østrem 1959 debris also reduces the amplitude of the melt signal and causes an increase in the lag from peak air temperature to peak melt with the effect greater for thicker covers fyffe et al 2014 recent dye tracing work fyffe et al 2019 found that a supraglacial debris cover reduced meltwater inputs and resulted in less efficient flow beneath the debris covered area in contrast up glacier the higher ablation rates of the clean and dirty ice and the focussing of supraglacial streams between moraine ridges produced an efficient conduit drainage system despite this new understanding dye tracing can only ever elucidate the system efficiency for specific drainage routes during the time of the test and cannot identify the proportion of water in each part of the system and how this varies diurnally and seasonally however hydrochemistry and proglacial hydrograph investigations can reveal variations in bulk water routing providing a complementary perspective on this rarely studied system glacier hydrochemistry can elucidate the conditions through which meltwater travels before emerging at the snout see brown 2002 for a review with the glacial runoff pattern a function of the recharge input hydrograph and how it has been influenced by the glacier hydrological system covington et al 2012 essentially the proglacial discharge and its chemistry provides a cumulative insight into all of the meltwater sources and their transport paths so that if the chemical signature of a flow component usually defined by a meltwater source or transport path is known then its lag time and proportion of discharge can be determined brown 2002 understanding bulk water routing also allows a clearer understanding of the processes leading to sediment transport and solute acquisition variations in suspended sediment have implications for nutrient cycling hawkings et al 2016 hodson et al 2004 and also influence turbidity affecting light penetration and primary productivity milner et al 2017 furthermore there is currently little knowledge of how the unusual hydrological system identified from dye tracing affects the glacier hydrochemistry and proglacial runoff some work has dealt with solute ssc and discharge characteristics of debris covered glaciers see table 1 but these studies do not relate their findings to the existence of a supraglacial debris cover we hypothesis that proglacial solute will be enhanced due to prolonged contact with debris both supraglacially and subglacially especially for the delayed flow component composed of sub debris melt it is expected that the proglacial hydrograph will be relatively subdued with a long time to peak discharge and a less strongly peaked diurnal hydrograph given the known lag time to peak melt beneath debris fyffe et al 2014 and the less efficient hydrological system beneath the lower glacier fyffe et al 2019 using data collected from the debris covered miage glacier italy this paper therefore has the following aims 1 determine the influence of supraglacial debris on supraglacial and proglacial water chemistry 2 determine how the debris impact on the supraglacial hydrograph and englacial and subglacial drainage system structure determine the form and magnitude of the proglacial hydrograph 3 establish an understanding of the main flow components in debris covered glacier runoff 2 study site miage glacier is a 10 5 km2 glacier with an elevation range of 1740 4640 m a s l situated in the western italian alps fig 1 it sits within a catchment of approximately 22 7 km2 bounded by the ridge crest from pointe baretti around to petit mont blanc deline 2005 and by large lateral moraines surrounding the lower glacier miage glacier has four steep icefall tributaries the mont blanc dome bionassay and tête carrée glaciers the main tongue occupies a deep trough from which it flows into val veny bending eastwards and dividing into the large northern and southern lobes and a smaller central lobe the glacier has a variety of surface types at high altitudes clean ice and snow dominate in the mid part of the glacier c 2400 2600 m a s l relief is controlled by medial and lateral moraines with a patchy covering of debris hereafter dirty ice in the intervening troughs whereas the lower 5 km of the glacier is almost continuously covered by debris with a mean thickness of 0 25 m foster et al 2012 the described extent of the continuous debris cover relevant to the 2010 2011 field seasons has existed since the 1930s deline 2005 though there has been an observed increase in debris cover at the expense of the moraine trough dirty ice since at least 2012 the debris originates predominantly from rockfalls and mixed snow and rock avalanches from the steep valley sides deline 2009 3 methodology meteorological hydrological and water chemistry measurements were conducted on miage glacier over the 2010 and 2011 summer seasons table 2 3 1 meteorology and melt modelling two energy balance weather stations were installed on continuous debris on the upper uws and lower lws glacier in 2010 and 2011 with a further station iws measuring only air temperature situated over an area of thin and patchy debris in 2011 fig 1 for full details of the instrumentation and variables measured see brock et al 2010 and fyffe et al 2014 a distributed energy balance melt model was constructed for miage glacier see fyffe et al 2014 for detailed model methods and results the model runs at an hourly timestep over a 30 30 m grid over the miage glacier catchment with exactly the same inputs and parameters as outlined in fyffe et al 2014 the difference between simulated and measured melt at long term stakes was 0 001 m d 1 5 with the rmse between simulated and measured debris surface temperature at lws 1 8 c r2 0 95 comparison between simulated melt plus effective precipitation defined as rainfall minus evaporation with rainfall distributed using a rainfall lapse rate derived from measured rainfall at tipping bucket rain gauges situated at lws and uws and measured discharge resulted in a rmse of 3 26 m3 s 1 in 2010 and 3 77 m3 s 1 in 2011 with a model bias of 0 94 in 2010 and 2 60 in 2011 this underestimation of discharge is likely due to raingauge undercatch since values corresponded well during dry periods note that no routing routines were applied to account for water transport through the hydrological system 3 2 supraglacial and proglacial water chemistry water samples were taken in the morning and afternoon at the gauging station during field visits almost daily in june 2010 and every second or third day during other field trips the average time of morning measurements in 2010 was 10 44 and in 2011 was 10 06 with the average time of afternoon measurements 16 54 in 2010 and 16 43 in 2011 conductivity and water temperature were measured continuously at the gauging station see table 3 at one minute intervals during field visits and 30 minute intervals between visits unfortunately clogging of the probe with sediment resulted in large periods of erroneous conductivity data conductivity data were collected from 23 06 2010 to 28 06 2010 from 28 07 2010 to 23 08 2010 from 06 09 2010 to 12 09 2010 from 05 06 2011 to 26 06 2011 from 26 07 2011 to 24 08 2011 and from 12 09 2011 to 15 09 2011 although there are smaller gaps within these periods water samples were also collected from supraglacial streams ponds and lakes and three snow samples were melted and analysed see fig 1 and table 4 sample locations were chosen to represent the range of supraglacial environments on the glacier and allow the conditions conducive to solute and sediment acquisition to be determined water samples were filtered in the field using a nalgene field filter holder and receiver and hand pump and a pre weighed whatman cellulose nitrate membrane filter 0 45 μm pore size and 47 mm diameter following standard procedures hubbard and glasser 2005 the filter papers were oven dried and weighed in the laboratory to determine the suspended sediment concentration ssc each sample was stored in an acid rinsed bottle in a cool bag or fridge except during transit to the uk whenever a water sample was taken the conductivity water temperature turbidity and ph of the stream pond or lake was also measured using hand held probes table 3 each sample was tested for the concentration of sulphate and bicarbonate ions these ions were chosen due to their common use as indicators of the subglacial environment sulphate ions are generated by sulphide oxidation within water routed slowly within a distributed system although snow and groundwater can also be a source of sulphate with bicarbonate ions generated from acid hydrolysis signifying contact of meltwater with sediment either at the bed or suspended in stream brown 2002 brown et al 1996 raiswell 1984 tranter et al 1996 1993a tranter and raiswell 1991 sulphate concentration was found by adding a powdered sulphate reagent with the sample absorbance tested in a cecil ce 4002 spectrophotometer accuracy of 0 005a or 1 whichever is greater the test has a stated measurement range of between 2 and 100 mg l 1 the measured absorbance was calibrated to sulphate concentration using a calibration curve the results were not accepted if they differed by more than 100 µeq l 1 for the remaining samples the mean median absolute difference between samples was 28 7 19 4 µeq l 1 or 18 12 in 2010 and 9 3 5 3 µeq l 1 or 51 8 in 2011 the mean percentage difference is larger in 2011 due to the increased number of lower concentration supraglacial samples the concentration of bicarbonate was found by titrating 20 ml of sample with 0 01 mol l 1 hydrochloric acid using kittiwake ph 4 5 indicator two titrations were carried out on each sample and they were accepted if the volume of hydrochloric acid added agreed within 2 ml 59 8 µeq l 1 of bicarbonate if not then a third test was performed and if two of the three tests agreed then their values were used instead the average absolute difference between the tests was 24 7 µeq l 1 of bicarbonate 5 once both the sulphate and bicarbonate concentrations had been found they were used to calculate the c ratio hco3 hco3 so4 2 brown et al 1996 the partial pressure of co2 was also calculated from the ph and bicarbonate concentration see brown 2002 eq 9 3 3 the impact of debris on the proglacial hydrograph 3 3 1 field measurements proglacial runoff was derived from water level measurements and a rating curve collected at a gauging station located on the northern lobe stream upstream of any confluences gs in fig 1 it consisted of a pressure transducer hung in a stilling well bolted onto a very large boulder see table 3 the onset hobo pressure data were compensated using air pressure data from mont de la saxe 7 6 km from the gauging station dye tracing indicates that the small outflow from the southern lobe is derived locally from only the area of that lobe fyffe 2012 so the runoff from the rest of the glacier exits via the northern lobe a high flow event in june 2011 caused damage to the well resulting in data loss between 18 06 2011 and 03 08 2011 and the repositioning of the well data was also lost between 27 08 2010 and 28 08 2010 and between 04 09 2010 and 08 09 2010 the measured stages from all time periods were adjusted to the datum of the june 2010 well so that one stage discharge rating could be applied a total of 16 rhodamine wt dye dilution gaugings were used to construct a two part rating curve with a percentage error of 14 6 see supplementary information a for further details 3 3 2 analysis of the proglacial runoff record daily hydrographs were categorised into shape categories following hannah et al 2000 1999 and swift et al 2005 the hydrograph classes were predetermined and hydrographs classified manually to allow a more direct comparison of results with other workers the runoff record was divided into 24 h periods days with the beginning of the day being the average time of minimum runoff for complete days with no rain of 11 00 in 2010 daily hydrographs were classified as either i diurnal a peak in the middle of the day and lower flows at the beginning and end ii rising iii falling or iv unknown hydrograph steady or could not be assigned to one of the other categories if a hydrograph fell between two categories then the most prominent feature of the hydrograph was used to determine its category only complete days with no rain were categorised mean hydrographs for categories i to iii are in fig 2 following swift et al 2005 specific parameters were calculated for each of the hydrographs classified as diurnal as well as averages for each year see table 5 the 2010 and 2011 melt season hydrographs were delimited into phases based on the dominant hydrograph type fig 3 the percentage of days of each hydrograph type diurnal rising or falling not including unknown hydrographs was calculated for a running 10 day period with the mid day of the 10 day period used as the phase boundary the early season period is phase 1 later in the season from the beginning of july onwards hydrographs are classified as either phase 2 when more than 50 of the hydrographs are diurnally classified or phase 3 when less than 50 of the hydrographs are diurnally classified to find the lag time between peak air temperature and discharge the time between maximum air temperature and maximum discharge was calculated with the day starting at 11 00 lag times were also calculated between maximum air temperature and minimum conductivity and between minimum conductivity and maximum discharge only diurnally classified conductivity data defined as having a minimum conductivity in the middle of the day and higher values before and after this were used in this analysis lag times were also calculated statistically using a lag correlation between hourly discharge and air temperature records from lws and uws the discharge record was moved back in time in hourly increments and the correlation repeated up to a lag of 24 h with the lag time with the highest correlation coefficient giving the average lag time the records were also split into 10 day periods and the process repeated to reveal seasonal changes only the 2010 record was used in the statistical analysis due to its completeness and all days were included 4 results 4 1 the influence of debris on supraglacial and proglacial water chemistry 4 1 1 supraglacial water chemistry supraglacial water chemistry results are given in table 4 with sulphate and bicarbonate concentrations shown in fig 4 there is a distinction in bicarbonate concentrations between the two largest streams on the upper glacier s12 and s14 which demonstrated lower bicarbonate concentrations and also lower ssc and most of the other samples which had bicarbonate concentrations around 300 µeq l 1 note that although s15 was close to s12 and s15 it had a smaller mainly debris covered catchment sp5 a small pond had the highest bicarbonate concentrations with the lower glacier streams s1 and s7 also showing elevated concentrations the average supraglacial stream bicarbonate concentration was much lower 286 µeq l 1 than the proglacial stream values 783 µeq l 1 in 2010 and 603 µeq l 1 in 2011 there was not a distinction in sulphate concentrations between the larger upglacier streams and the smaller streams on the lower glacier however the sulphate concentration of sp5 was particularly high 87 µeq l 1 with the values for the c4 and c8 lakes also high compared to the supraglacial streams the elevated sulphate concentrations measured at ws5 are likely because the samples were taken in early june 2010 when its catchment was snow covered since snow sample 3 demonstrated elevated sulphate concentrations the mean sulphate concentration of supraglacial stream measurements of 16 µeq l 1 was an order of magnitude lower than gauging station values 4 1 2 proglacial water chemistry the concentration of sulphate ions measured at the proglacial stream was high compared with other clean glaciers table 6 with values most similar to the debris covered dokriani glacier outside of the monsoon season the highest values of sulphate on miage glacier were either when there was a pulse of ion and sediment rich water 09 06 2010 474 μeq l 1 corresponding to a fall in discharge and a peak in conductivity ssc and bicarbonate concentration or when discharges were low during cold weather e g 367 μeq l 1 on 20 06 2010 and 383 μeq l 1 on 15 09 2011 even though the highest sulphate concentration measured was on 09 06 10 the delayed flow sulphate concentrations were still high even in mid summer table 4 the variation between different times of year was small with the difference between mean june and mean july august concentrations being only 5 µeq l 1 in 2010 and 25 µeq l 1 in 2011 this contrasts with haut glacier d arolla and austre brøggerbreen where june sulphate concentrations were at least twice those later in the season tranter et al 1996 the relationship between sulphate and discharge was generally weak so in 2010 the only relationship with discharge was in september when the sulphate concentration increased as discharge decreased p value 0 016 r2 37 3 although in 2011 this negative relationship was also found in june p value 0 009 r2 27 4 and more strongly in july and august p value 0 017 r2 58 4 even taking account of the elevated supraglacial bicarbonate concentrations section 4 1 the mean and range of proglacial values are still high compared to clean glaciers table 6 the values are most similar to the debris covered batura glacier and dokriani glacier during the monsoon season slightly above the values for grimsvötn and below those from the icing at scott turnerbreen as for sulphate bicarbonate concentrations were highest either in june 2010 when there was a pulse of sediment and ion rich water 913 μeq l 1 on 09 06 2010 at 10 05 or during recessional flow for instance 1092 µeq l 1 at 10 30 on 22 06 2010 corresponding with a particularly low discharge of 1 65 m3 s 1 the bicarbonate concentration decreased over the season in 2010 but this was not mirrored in 2011 unlike sulphate the bicarbonate concentration never had a significant relationship with discharge in 2010 or 2011 4 2 the impact of debris on the proglacial hydrograph the runoff and meteorological conditions in 2010 and 2011 are given in fig 5 average values are calculated for the melt season with 2011 meteorological averages found for the same dates as the 2010 record see table 2 4 2 1 hydrograph shape classification hydrograph shape classification table 7 revealed that the majority of hydrographs were diurnal in both years with almost as many rising but fewer falling hydrographs of the diurnally classified hydrographs in 2010 2011 7 6 were found in june 14 no data in july 8 16 in august and 3 3 in september even diurnally classified hydrographs often did not smoothly rise or fall and could exhibit a flattened or variable peak hannah et al 2000 and swift et al 2005 classified daily hydrographs from haut glacier d arolla into shape categories with hannah et al 1999 conducting similar analysis on taillon glacier runoff the haut glacier d arolla and taillon glacier runoff records were classified using principle component analysis meaning the hydrograph classes were statistically derived and unique to the runoff record a direct comparison with the miage glacier classes although predetermined and conducted manually to aid comparison should therefore be treated with caution nevertheless table 7 shows miage glacier has fewer diurnal hydrographs over the season than was classified for haut glacier d arolla in 1998 and 1999 miage glacier had a similar number of diurnal hydrographs to taillon glacier and haut glacier d arolla in 1989 but some of the building late peaked hydrographs which rise to a peak around 24 00 would have been classed as diurnal for miage glacier 4 2 2 the amplitude of diurnal hydrographs the diurnal runoff amplitude described by qdmax qdmin can be compared to other clean and debris covered glaciers tables 8 and 9 the range for miage glacier from 1 2 in june phase 1 to 2 12 in phase 3a is similar to dokriani glacier slightly higher than gangotri glacier and always higher than dunagiri glacier the aforementioned glaciers are all debris covered and their values including those of miage glacier are all lower than those given for the clean qiyi and parlung no 4 glaciers although the glacier area may alter the discharge ratio the glacier area of miage glacier and parlung no 4 are very similar table 10 values of qdsdamp found by averaging values for peaked hydrographs of different magnitudes were also given by swift et al 2005 for haut glacier d arolla the swift et al 2005 values ranged from 0 83 2 40 equating to qdmax qdmin of 1 83 3 40 which appears relatively high compared to values for both miage glacier and the other debris covered glaciers similarly found values of qdsdamp given by hannah et al 1999 for taillon glacier ranged from 0 434 to 2 649 equating to qdmax qdmin of 1 434 3 649 again giving high values compared to the debris covered glaciers this suggests that the diurnal runoff amplitude of debris covered glaciers is less than clean glaciers 4 2 3 lag time analysis lag times between air temperature and peak discharge determined by analysis of daily hydrographs are shown in table 11 the mean and minimum lag times of the debris covered glaciers are greater than that of the clean glaciers the maximum lag time was greatest for parlung no 4 glacier but this value could have been influenced by colder weather in october lag times were also derived by conducting lag correlations between discharge and air temperature in 2010 all correlations were statistically significant p 0 05 with correlations generally stronger with uws than lws the lag time for the whole discharge time series was between 9 and 10 h uws relationship table 12 compares statistically derived lag times for a range of glaciers the two debris covered glaciers miage glacier and keqikaer glacier have longer minimum lag times than all of the clean glaciers baounet glacier and haut glacier d arolla are both temperate alpine glaciers similar to miage glacier and both their maximum and minimum lag times are much lower than the values for miage glacier by 14 15 h and 4 7 h respectively despite the small dataset there is therefore evidence that there is a greater lag time between peak air temperature and peak runoff for the debris covered glaciers compared to the clean glaciers lag times from peak air temperature to minimum conductivity 3 47 and 2 75 h in 2010 and 2011 respectively were shorter than between peak air temperature and peak runoff 6 34 and 7 92 h in 2010 and 2011 respectively when both diurnally classified proglacial discharge and diurnally classified conductivity data were available only 8 days in total see fig 6 there was often a delay between the time of lowest conductivity and highest discharge resulting in discharge and conductivity rising in phase for a few hours the mean time between minimum conductivity and maximum discharge in 2010 2011 was 2 5 4 25 h fig 6 shows the temporal change in the relationship between conductivity and discharge on individual days the clearest cyclic hysteresis is anticlockwise resulting in conductivity increasing with discharge in the evening or sometimes high but variable discharge and increasing conductivity for conductivity to increase with discharge the solute load must be increasing at a greater rate than discharge fountain 1992 4 2 4 runoff fluctuations and their relation to meteorological variations 4 2 4 1 phase 1 early season runoff during the entire phase 1 period in 2010 and prior to 13 06 11 in the 2011 record discharges generally remained low average 3 2 m3 s 1 and 2 1 m3 s 1 for 2010 and 2011 respectively and although diurnal hydrographs dominated they had a small amplitude in 2010 variations over a few days had a larger magnitude than diurnal fluctuations in 2011 discharges rose on 13 06 11 but did not rise substantially until 15 06 11 followed by the large flood event on 18 06 11 caused by very heavy rainfall fig 5 in both years air temperatures during phase 1 periods were lower than average 4 2 4 2 phase 2 diurnal runoff during phase 2 in both years the discharge increased alongside an increase in the percentage of diurnal hydrographs and the mean amplitude of diurnal hydrographs to 5 0 m3 s 1 in both years fig 7 a and b these changes were driven by consistently fine weather with increased air temperatures and only occasional rainfall mean lws air temperature in phase 2 was greater than average by 4 4 c in 2010 and 2 3 c in 2011 the flows in 2010 did not increase until around three days after the rise in air temperature although within the phase 2 period the discharge was more responsive to meteorological changes e g the shape of the hydrograph peak relates to the hourly modelled ablation on 11 07 10 see fig 7a 4 2 4 3 phase 3 hydrographs with reverse asymmetry the phase 3 runoff in 2010 begins around 16 07 10 fig 7c the overall discharge magnitude was similar to average 5 9 m3 s 1 average 5 3 m3 s 1 with the discharge amplitude larger than average 2 7 m3 s 1 for diurnal hydrographs only with 3 4 m3 s 1 the average the lag time to peak discharge for diurnal hydrographs 4 46 h was shorter than average and for phase 2 but including all hydrographs was much longer 8 17 h the mean air temperature at lws was within 1 c of the average the phase 3 runoff in 2011 occurred both before phase 3a and after phase 3b fig 7d the phase 2 runoff period the mean discharge of the phase 3a and 3b runoff for diurnal and all hydrographs was higher 3a and lower 3b than average but by not much more than 1 m3 s 1 the discharge amplitude was higher than average using only diurnal hydrographs in phase 3a but lower than average in phase 3b using both diurnal and all hydrographs the lag time of phase 3a and 3b around 9 10 h was higher than phase 2 and the seasonal average the mean air temperature at lws of the phase 3a and 3b periods was also within 1 c of the average phase 3 runoff tends to show reverse asymmetry in 2010 and 2011 see fig 7c the increasingly warm air temperatures between 30 07 10 and 01 08 10 lead to a gradually rising hydrograph then after the precipitation inputs passed and the weather cooled the runoff decreases warmer temperatures lead to gradually increasing discharges but a decrease in air temperature leads to a sharp runoff decrease in 2011 fig 7d shows the rise in night time air temperature on 28 08 10 results in a rising hydrograph on 29 08 10 in the following days the discharge does become diurnal but the minimum flow has a clearer trough than the maximum flow has a peak 5 discussion 5 1 the influence of debris on supraglacial and proglacial water chemistry the proglacial concentration of sulphate and bicarbonate ions was high for miage glacier compared with clean glaciers section 4 1 2 the concentration of sulphate ions can be influenced by a snowpack sulphate derived from deposition of mainly the sea salt aerosol tranter et al 1996 b contact of water with sediment at the bed resulting in sulphide oxidation tranter et al 1993b or c by the influence of groundwater the influence of supraglacial debris on sulphate concentrations is not known from previous studies sulphate values in snow were low with a mean concentration of 76 µeq l 1 compared to 215 µeq l 1 on average in the proglacial stream in 2011 table 4 most supraglacial streams had very low sulphate concentrations demonstrating that they mainly contained ice melt there was not a clear distinction in sulphate concentrations between the upper and lower glacier supraglacial stream samples suggesting that supraglacial debris does not increase the sulphate concentrations however a higher sulphate concentration was measured in the small pond sp5 suggesting that the longer sediment contact was conducive to coupled sulphide oxidation and carbonate dissolution reactions which produce bicarbonate and sulphate ions brown 2002 however the small ponds were not prevalent enough to be a significant ion source similar conditions likely occur in the larger lakes c4 and c8 although meltwater from their large ice cliffs would lower ion concentrations the lake ion concentrations were lower than proglacial values with lakes only providing ions to proglacial runoff upon drainage therefore apart from the early season snowmelt most proglacial sulphate is not of a supraglacial origin the lower glacier streams draining debris covered catchments had higher bicarbonate concentrations than the upper streams draining mainly clean ice contact of meltwater with debris possibly while within the debris matrix therefore results in enough water rock interaction to enrich the bicarbonate concentration through acid hydrolysis the greater sediment availability may also lead to a higher ssc allowing in stream acid hydrolysis and the production of bicarbonate ions even in ice walled streams tranter et al 1993a ice cliff meltwater may reduce bicarbonate concentrations e g at s5 which is a stream bounded by ice cliffs in a thickly debris covered catchment concentrations were higher in sp5 again suggesting that small ponds may be an ion source although debris enriched the supraglacial bicarbonate concentration the average supraglacial stream concentration 286 µeq l 1 was still considerably lower than the average gauging station concentration 783 µeq l 1 in 2010 and 603 µeq l 1 in 2011 given the difference in supraglacial and proglacial concentrations of both bicarbonate and sulphate concentrations there must therefore be a significant proportion of the proglacial concentration produced instream from groundwater or at the bed it is most likely that the proglacial ions are produced from reactions within a distributed hydrological system which underlies the lower glacier since there is already evidence of its existence from dye tracing fyffe et al 2019 the ions could also be produced if water spent time in the sedimentary raised bed underlying the lower glacier pavan et al 1999 cited in deline 2002 both of these environments would contain freshly comminuted rock flour and be conducive to long enough residence times to elevate sulphate concentrations tranter et al 1993b tranter and raiswell 1991 both bicarbonate and sulphate concentrations remained high throughout the melt season suggesting that a significant proportion of meltwater passed through the distributed system even in mid summer section 4 1 2 groundwater was sampled from a spring next to the valley river the dora d veny fig 1 and concentrations of sulphate and bicarbonate were very high 2959 µeq l 1 and 1361 µeq l 1 respectively with a c ratio of 0 32 however the c ratio was much lower than the lowest value measured at the proglacial stream 0 63 even if the bicarbonate concentration is artificially increased by 286 µeq l 1 to account for the average supraglacial input of bicarbonate ions the c ratio is still 0 36 the sulphate concentrations were twice the highest values found from boreholes beneath haut glacier d arolla with such high values suggesting long residence times in anoxic conditions where sulphide oxidation may be catalysed by microbial activity brown 2002 it is therefore less likely the proglacial ions are derived from groundwater at least that of a composition similar to the spring measured furthermore although bicarbonate ions can be produced within post mixing chemical reactions tranter et al 1993a the bicarbonate and sulphate ion concentrations tend to vary together although the only significant relationship was in july august 2010 they also tend to be high during low flow periods suggesting that a portion of the bicarbonate concentration is produced subglacially 5 2 the impact of debris on the proglacial hydrograph 5 2 1 the influence of supraglacial debris on proglacial discharge amplitude and lag time comparison of the lag time and diurnal discharge amplitude of debris free and debris covered glaciers sections 4 2 2 and 4 2 3 suggests that glaciers with an extensive supraglacial debris cover have a more subdued proglacial hydrograph with a smaller amplitude and longer lag time between peak air temperature and discharge compared to clean glaciers this corroborates the findings of li et al 2016 in the tibetan plateau and corresponds with the lower overall percentage of diurnal hydrographs found when comparing miage glacier and haut glacier d arolla section 4 2 1 however comparable data were only available for 6 debris covered and 6 clean glaciers for lag time analysis and 4 debris covered and 4 clean glaciers for diurnal discharge amplitude parameters the lower discharge amplitude and fewer diurnal hydrographs under average weather conditions could be due to a more subdued input or recharge hydrograph covington et al 2012 an attenuated input hydrograph from debris covered areas will be caused by the time taken for the temperature signal to be conducted down through the debris to the ice debris interface resulting in melt continuing into the evening fyffe et al 2014 especially fig 7 nicholson and benn 2006 reid and brock 2010 this increases the lag time between peak air temperature and peak melt which increases with increasing debris thickness although the runoff delay will be less than that of the average debris thickness since more melt is produced beneath thinner debris fyffe et al 2014 thus supraglacial debris will reduce the amplitude of the input hydrograph increasing the baseflow and decreasing the diurnal discharge amplitude furthermore melt must flow within the debris and or at the ice debris interface prior to reaching a supraglacial stream flow velocities in this system are unknown but it may provide a further delay to water transfer flow within streams within the debris covered region of miage glacier is known to be relatively slow fyffe et al 2019 and miles et al 2019 reported slow flow velocities between an interconnected pond system on khumbu glacier the relatively inefficient supraglacial transfer of meltwater within the debris covered region would increase the time between melt production and input into the englacial subglacial system the input hydrograph could also be attenuated by an inefficient englacial or subglacial system or the existence of a subglacial aquifer flowers 2008 flowers and clarke 2002 an inefficient englacial subglacial system was found beneath the debris covered area fyffe et al 2019 with the high proglacial bicarbonate and sulphate concentrations further confirming its existence section 5 1 the volume of storage is key to determining whether or not recharge hydrographs are altered by the glacial drainage system covington et al 2012 flowers 2008 identified that a subglacial aquifer can attenuate hydrographs and while covington et al 2012 demonstrated that although conduits and a linked cavity system did not normally modify the recharge hydrograph they could if linked to sufficiently large storage such as crevasses or lakes the inefficient englacial subglacial system could therefore alter the recharge hydrograph if the degree of storage in the system was sufficient the thickness and hydraulic conductivity of the bed materials could also have a significant influence on the discharge amplitude and lag time flowers 2008 flowers and clarke 2002 the lower miage glacier sits on a sediment bed around 50 m thick pavan et al 1999 cited in deline 2002 flowers 2008 showed that a soft sediment bed would lower the amplitude of diurnal fluctuations increasing the lag time from peak melt to peak discharge and inhibiting conduit formation compared to a hard bedded glacier flowers 2008 also showed that a subglacial aquifer beneath the sediment bed would further reduce the discharge amplitude with the effect increasing with aquifer thickness and hydraulic conductivity this is driven by higher water pressures resulting in flow being transferred from subglacial channels to be stored in the surrounding sediments with water flowing back to the channels as pressures drop hubbard et al 1995 debris covered glaciers often rest on sedimentary beds since a substantial supraglacial debris cover indicates a high rate of debris supply and high englacial debris concentrations maisch et al 1999 low sub debris melt rates and a long low angled tongue would likely also reduce the debris transport capability of meltwater streams with debris accumulating at the bed as a result the impacts of a raised bed sediment aquifer on the proglacial hydrograph may therefore also apply to other debris covered glaciers whether the lag time from peak air temperature to peak discharge is increased due to the debris cover for a particular glacier will depend upon the debris thickness distribution and its proportional cover over the glacier since these factors will influence the proportion of sub debris melt and the average delay due to conduction of heat to the ice debris interface if rapidly routed clean ice melt is a large enough proportion of runoff then the lag time may not be influenced by the debris cover since the clean ice component will provide the discharge peak c f miage glacier in section 5 3 furthermore the bed composition bedrock or sedimentary and the thickness and hydraulic conductivity of any raised bed could influence the amplitude and timing of the proglacial hydrograph flowers 2008 flowers and clarke 2002 5 2 2 runoff fluctuations and their relationship to meteorological conditions phase 1 proglacial hydrographs were subdued in both years even though most of the lower glacier was snow free from 2290 m a s l in 2010 and 2400 m a s l in 2011 and dye tracing suggested the main subglacial channel system was open and efficient from at least 09 06 10 and 10 06 11 fyffe et al 2019 on the upper glacier the snow cover would have reduced the supraglacial hydrograph amplitude and increased the meltwater travel time campbell et al 2006 willis et al 2002 meanwhile on the debris covered lower glacier meltwater inputs would be small and attenuated due to the conduction of heat through the debris fyffe et al 2014 and smaller supraglacial streams fyffe et al 2019 meltwater from the debris covered region will therefore have a subdued hydrograph and if the stream passes through the distributed system underlying the lower glacier see section 5 1 and fyffe et al 2019 it may be delayed englacially and subglacially too this means that a proglacial hydrograph with a smaller amplitude and longer lag from peak air temperature to peak discharge can result even if a large proportion of the lower glacier is snow free if the snow free region is instead debris covered phase 2 periods were found during warmer than average weather conditions by mid summer large areas of clean and dirty ice were snow free with the snowline up to approximately the base of the bionassay glacier by 31 07 10 and slightly less coverage in 2011 the removal of snowcover from the debris free area would have increased the magnitude and amplitude of meltwater inputs to the upper glacier moulins e g s12 and s14 willis et al 2002 the main subglacial drainage system remained efficient in both years and although the drainage system beneath the debris covered area increased in efficiency it was still less efficient than that emanating from higher on the glacier fyffe et al 2019 continued drainage through the distributed system is also confirmed by the proglacial sulphate and bicarbonate concentrations which remained high throughout the summer section 5 1 removal of snow from the clean and dirty ice area is therefore required to increase the amplitude of the upglacier supraglacial hydrograph and therefore lead to a clear proglacial diurnal signal phase 2 periods therefore require consistently warm and dry weather as well as the loss of snow cover from the upglacier clean ice phase 3 runoff occurred during average weather conditions and resulted in close to average proglacial discharges and diurnal amplitudes and a hydrograph with reverse asymmetry where flow increases gradually but falls quickly smeared or multiple hydrograph peaks could be caused by multiple input points with different lag times covington et al 2012 since variations in debris thickness cause variations in the time of the supraglacial hydrograph peak fyffe et al 2014 and the debris morphology leads to many smaller input points fyffe et al 2019 miles et al 2017 this may result in a flattened peak especially if cooler weather means a larger proportion of runoff is from the debris covered area the reverse asymmetry of the phase 3 runoff hydrograph is somewhat unusual a possible explanation involves percolation of meltwater into the sediment aquifer beneath the lower glacier if the input of water into the subglacial system is less than the maximum potential rate of infiltration into the aquifer which would depend upon the aquifer hydraulic conductivity the aquifer could essentially capture the drainage flowers and clarke 2002 net loss to the aquifer would be especially noticeable when most meltwater is introduced from further upglacier and inputs from the lower glacier are limited a second possible mechanism involves the overdeepening which occurs just upstream of the bend in the main tongue pavan et al 1999 cited in deline 2002 water pressures close to overburden are required for subglacial water to flow up the adverse bed slope and exit the overdeepening the rise in the pressure melting point as the water flows up the adverse bed slope can result in supercooling forming frazil ice which can reduce the hydraulic conductivity and subsequently flow rates alley et al 1998 whether or not supercooling occurs is dependent upon the riegel slope angle alley et al 1998 how close the water temperature is to the melting temperature and by water pressure variations dow et al 2014 if the riegel is steep enough water flow could be restricted especially when water pressures are lower dow et al 2014 potentially increasing hydrograph recession 5 3 the flow components of miage glacier runoff by combining the results of the hydrochemistry section 5 1 and proglacial discharge analysis section 5 2 the main flow components of miage glacier runoff can be identified fig 8 supraglacial hydrochemistry demonstrated that upper glacier clean ice melt does not tend to acquire solutes with dye tracing revealing that upper glacier meltwater is drained efficiently fyffe et al 2019 the fast transfer of this dilute clean ice melt component suggests its peak at the proglacial stream is indicated by the conductivity minimum which arrives around 3 h after peak air temperature section 4 2 4 meanwhile on the debris covered lower glacier the small supraglacial streams flow more slowly fyffe et al 2019 with meltwater acquiring bicarbonate ions due to its contact with sediment section 4 1 1 dye tracing indicated some of the lower glacier subglacial drainage pathways were inefficient fyffe et al 2019 with the high proglacial sulphate and bicarbonate concentrations confirming this section 5 1 sub debris melt will therefore likely have a greater solute concentration and take longer to arrive at the snout this explains the evening rise of conductivity with discharge shown in fig 6 the delayed debris component becomes a larger proportion of runoff in the evening and likely peaks when the discharge peaks 6 8 h after peak air temperature however since modelling suggested melt from the debris covered region provided only 27 30 of total melt fyffe et al 2014 melt from the tributary glaciers very high upglacier may constitute the remainder of the discharge peak the longer travel times of the debris component explains the observed long lag times between air temperature and peak discharge for debris covered glaciers section 4 2 3 presuming that the clean ice component peaks at the time of minimum conductivity while the debris component peaks at the time of maximum discharge then the overall delay due to the debris cover averaged over the glacier can be calculated from the difference between these times 2 5 h in 2010 and 4 25 h in 2011 based on 8 days of conductivity data several mechanisms could account for this delay section 5 2 1 including attenuation of the melt signal due to conduction of heat through the debris smaller supraglacial streams a less efficient englacial subglacial hydrological system and a sediment bed the delay due to heat conduction averaged over the glacier is around 1 2 h fyffe et al 2014 with the less efficient englacial subglacial system resulting in a delay of around 1 9 h fyffe et al 2019 supplementary information b outlines how these delays were derived since these delays are roughly equal in duration both should be included in debris covered glacier runoff models supraglacial dye tracing is needed to determine the supraglacial efficiency of debris covered glaciers while further runoff modelling would be needed to fully understand the influence of a sediment aquifer 6 conclusions supraglacial debris influences glacier hydrochemistry in two main ways firstly greater supraglacial water rock contact on the lower glacier increases the ssc and bicarbonate concentration of supraglacial lakes and streams the supraglacial debris only influences sulphate concentrations where residence times are long e g in small ponds secondly since the debris cover inhibits the formation of a channelised network beneath thickly debris covered areas fyffe et al 2019 it indirectly increases the proglacial bicarbonate and sulphate concentrations by increasing the proportion of water which is routed through an inefficient subglacial system the miage glacier runoff hydrograph is a product of the melt signal and its alteration by the hydrological system since the supraglacial debris attenuates the melt signal fyffe et al 2014 and results in an inefficient subglacial system fed by smaller input streams fyffe et al 2019 this means the flow component composed of sub debris melt has a longer lag time than the flow component from the clean and dirty ice which is routed efficiently from the mid glacier this increases the discharge baseflow and increases the lag time between peak air temperature and peak runoff although the raised sediment bed may also play a role in attenuating the proglacial hydrograph discharge and conductivity commonly showed anti clockwise hysteresis with conductivity and discharge rising in phase for a few hours this suggests that the dilute melt component likely peaks before the more ion rich debris and tributary components the delaying effect of the debris also means that both a snow free upper glacier and particularly warm weather are required for diurnal hydrographs to dominate under average weather conditions rising or falling hydrographs dominate and the hydrograph tends to rise more slowly than it falls resulting in reverse asymmetry in the hydrograph these conclusions show that the hydrochemistry and proglacial runoff signal of debris covered glaciers differs from clean glaciers given that data for comparison was from a relatively small sample of glaciers work to increase this sample size and differentiate the influence of specific catchment and debris characteristics on the proglacial runoff signal would be welcomed these findings will be relevant to other catchments with debris covered glaciers and those that are likely to become more debris covered in the future e g bhambri et al 2011 bolch et al 2008 lambrecht et al 2011 since receding glaciers may become more debris covered the influence of supraglacial debris on the runoff hydrograph should be accounted for within future runoff models the present study is a pioneering first step towards quantifying the influence of debris and glacier characteristics on supraglacial and proglacial hydrographs it will inform future work involving the direct comparison of hydrographs from multiple glaciers using a consistent methodology and the construction of a physically based hydrological model which takes into the account the influence of the debris on runoff this would allow the prediction of runoff given changes to the debris cover declaration of

6275,debris is known to influence the ablation topography and hydrological systems of glaciers this paper determines for the first time how these influences impact on bulk water routing and the proglacial runoff signal using analyses of supraglacial and proglacial water chemistry and proglacial discharge at miage glacier italian alps debris does influence the supraglacial water chemistry but the inefficient subglacial system beneath the debris covered zone also plays a role in increasing the ion contribution to the proglacial stream daily hydrographs had a lower amplitude and later discharge peak compared to clean glaciers and fewer diurnal hydrographs were found compared to similar analysis for haut glacier d arolla we attribute these observations to the attenuating effect of the debris on ablation smaller input streams on the debris covered area a less efficient subglacial system and possible leakage into a raised sediment bed beneath the glacier strongly diurnal hydrographs are constrained to periods with warmer than average conditions average weather conditions result in a hydrograph with reverse asymmetry conductivity and discharge commonly show anti clockwise hysteresis suggesting the more dilute rapidly routed melt component from the mid glacier peaks before the discharge peak with components from higher up glacier and the debris covered areas arriving later at the proglacial stream the results of this study could lead to a greater understanding of the hydrological structure of other debris covered glaciers with findings highlighting the need to include the influence of the debris cover within future models of debris covered glacier runoff keywords debris covered glaciers glacier hydrology proglacial discharge suspended sediment concentration glacier hydrochemistry 1 introduction glacial melt is an important component of downstream runoff especially during dry seasons maurya et al 2011 xu et al 2009 understanding the runoff hydrograph is important for water resources management for example for irrigation e g in the tien shan region of china wang et al 2014 and the development of hydropower projects e g in the indian himalaya srivastava et al 2014 there is a need to provide a more complete assessment of how glacier retreat may impact on hydropower revenues milner et al 2017 the diurnal amplitude of runoff from clean glaciers is expected to increase and the lag time to peak runoff to decrease in a warmer climate as the snowpack has a progressively smaller hydrological influence escher vetter and reinwarth 1994 however given the likely increase in debris cover on alpine glaciers stokes et al 2007 and the widespread occurrence of debris covered glaciers in high mountain regions scherler et al 2018 projections of runoff hydrographs need to include debris cover effects debris covered glaciers are especially common in the pamirs and himalaya bolch et al 2012 scherler et al 2011 caucasus mountains russia stokes et al 2007 and the western alps deline et al 2012 with the extent and thickness of debris cover increasing in many areas bhambri et al 2011 bolch et al 2008 kirkbride and deline 2013 lambrecht et al 2011 supraglacial debris cover reduces melt compared to bare ice except where the cover is thin or discontinuous kirkbride and dugmore 2003 mattson et al 1993 østrem 1959 debris also reduces the amplitude of the melt signal and causes an increase in the lag from peak air temperature to peak melt with the effect greater for thicker covers fyffe et al 2014 recent dye tracing work fyffe et al 2019 found that a supraglacial debris cover reduced meltwater inputs and resulted in less efficient flow beneath the debris covered area in contrast up glacier the higher ablation rates of the clean and dirty ice and the focussing of supraglacial streams between moraine ridges produced an efficient conduit drainage system despite this new understanding dye tracing can only ever elucidate the system efficiency for specific drainage routes during the time of the test and cannot identify the proportion of water in each part of the system and how this varies diurnally and seasonally however hydrochemistry and proglacial hydrograph investigations can reveal variations in bulk water routing providing a complementary perspective on this rarely studied system glacier hydrochemistry can elucidate the conditions through which meltwater travels before emerging at the snout see brown 2002 for a review with the glacial runoff pattern a function of the recharge input hydrograph and how it has been influenced by the glacier hydrological system covington et al 2012 essentially the proglacial discharge and its chemistry provides a cumulative insight into all of the meltwater sources and their transport paths so that if the chemical signature of a flow component usually defined by a meltwater source or transport path is known then its lag time and proportion of discharge can be determined brown 2002 understanding bulk water routing also allows a clearer understanding of the processes leading to sediment transport and solute acquisition variations in suspended sediment have implications for nutrient cycling hawkings et al 2016 hodson et al 2004 and also influence turbidity affecting light penetration and primary productivity milner et al 2017 furthermore there is currently little knowledge of how the unusual hydrological system identified from dye tracing affects the glacier hydrochemistry and proglacial runoff some work has dealt with solute ssc and discharge characteristics of debris covered glaciers see table 1 but these studies do not relate their findings to the existence of a supraglacial debris cover we hypothesis that proglacial solute will be enhanced due to prolonged contact with debris both supraglacially and subglacially especially for the delayed flow component composed of sub debris melt it is expected that the proglacial hydrograph will be relatively subdued with a long time to peak discharge and a less strongly peaked diurnal hydrograph given the known lag time to peak melt beneath debris fyffe et al 2014 and the less efficient hydrological system beneath the lower glacier fyffe et al 2019 using data collected from the debris covered miage glacier italy this paper therefore has the following aims 1 determine the influence of supraglacial debris on supraglacial and proglacial water chemistry 2 determine how the debris impact on the supraglacial hydrograph and englacial and subglacial drainage system structure determine the form and magnitude of the proglacial hydrograph 3 establish an understanding of the main flow components in debris covered glacier runoff 2 study site miage glacier is a 10 5 km2 glacier with an elevation range of 1740 4640 m a s l situated in the western italian alps fig 1 it sits within a catchment of approximately 22 7 km2 bounded by the ridge crest from pointe baretti around to petit mont blanc deline 2005 and by large lateral moraines surrounding the lower glacier miage glacier has four steep icefall tributaries the mont blanc dome bionassay and tête carrée glaciers the main tongue occupies a deep trough from which it flows into val veny bending eastwards and dividing into the large northern and southern lobes and a smaller central lobe the glacier has a variety of surface types at high altitudes clean ice and snow dominate in the mid part of the glacier c 2400 2600 m a s l relief is controlled by medial and lateral moraines with a patchy covering of debris hereafter dirty ice in the intervening troughs whereas the lower 5 km of the glacier is almost continuously covered by debris with a mean thickness of 0 25 m foster et al 2012 the described extent of the continuous debris cover relevant to the 2010 2011 field seasons has existed since the 1930s deline 2005 though there has been an observed increase in debris cover at the expense of the moraine trough dirty ice since at least 2012 the debris originates predominantly from rockfalls and mixed snow and rock avalanches from the steep valley sides deline 2009 3 methodology meteorological hydrological and water chemistry measurements were conducted on miage glacier over the 2010 and 2011 summer seasons table 2 3 1 meteorology and melt modelling two energy balance weather stations were installed on continuous debris on the upper uws and lower lws glacier in 2010 and 2011 with a further station iws measuring only air temperature situated over an area of thin and patchy debris in 2011 fig 1 for full details of the instrumentation and variables measured see brock et al 2010 and fyffe et al 2014 a distributed energy balance melt model was constructed for miage glacier see fyffe et al 2014 for detailed model methods and results the model runs at an hourly timestep over a 30 30 m grid over the miage glacier catchment with exactly the same inputs and parameters as outlined in fyffe et al 2014 the difference between simulated and measured melt at long term stakes was 0 001 m d 1 5 with the rmse between simulated and measured debris surface temperature at lws 1 8 c r2 0 95 comparison between simulated melt plus effective precipitation defined as rainfall minus evaporation with rainfall distributed using a rainfall lapse rate derived from measured rainfall at tipping bucket rain gauges situated at lws and uws and measured discharge resulted in a rmse of 3 26 m3 s 1 in 2010 and 3 77 m3 s 1 in 2011 with a model bias of 0 94 in 2010 and 2 60 in 2011 this underestimation of discharge is likely due to raingauge undercatch since values corresponded well during dry periods note that no routing routines were applied to account for water transport through the hydrological system 3 2 supraglacial and proglacial water chemistry water samples were taken in the morning and afternoon at the gauging station during field visits almost daily in june 2010 and every second or third day during other field trips the average time of morning measurements in 2010 was 10 44 and in 2011 was 10 06 with the average time of afternoon measurements 16 54 in 2010 and 16 43 in 2011 conductivity and water temperature were measured continuously at the gauging station see table 3 at one minute intervals during field visits and 30 minute intervals between visits unfortunately clogging of the probe with sediment resulted in large periods of erroneous conductivity data conductivity data were collected from 23 06 2010 to 28 06 2010 from 28 07 2010 to 23 08 2010 from 06 09 2010 to 12 09 2010 from 05 06 2011 to 26 06 2011 from 26 07 2011 to 24 08 2011 and from 12 09 2011 to 15 09 2011 although there are smaller gaps within these periods water samples were also collected from supraglacial streams ponds and lakes and three snow samples were melted and analysed see fig 1 and table 4 sample locations were chosen to represent the range of supraglacial environments on the glacier and allow the conditions conducive to solute and sediment acquisition to be determined water samples were filtered in the field using a nalgene field filter holder and receiver and hand pump and a pre weighed whatman cellulose nitrate membrane filter 0 45 μm pore size and 47 mm diameter following standard procedures hubbard and glasser 2005 the filter papers were oven dried and weighed in the laboratory to determine the suspended sediment concentration ssc each sample was stored in an acid rinsed bottle in a cool bag or fridge except during transit to the uk whenever a water sample was taken the conductivity water temperature turbidity and ph of the stream pond or lake was also measured using hand held probes table 3 each sample was tested for the concentration of sulphate and bicarbonate ions these ions were chosen due to their common use as indicators of the subglacial environment sulphate ions are generated by sulphide oxidation within water routed slowly within a distributed system although snow and groundwater can also be a source of sulphate with bicarbonate ions generated from acid hydrolysis signifying contact of meltwater with sediment either at the bed or suspended in stream brown 2002 brown et al 1996 raiswell 1984 tranter et al 1996 1993a tranter and raiswell 1991 sulphate concentration was found by adding a powdered sulphate reagent with the sample absorbance tested in a cecil ce 4002 spectrophotometer accuracy of 0 005a or 1 whichever is greater the test has a stated measurement range of between 2 and 100 mg l 1 the measured absorbance was calibrated to sulphate concentration using a calibration curve the results were not accepted if they differed by more than 100 µeq l 1 for the remaining samples the mean median absolute difference between samples was 28 7 19 4 µeq l 1 or 18 12 in 2010 and 9 3 5 3 µeq l 1 or 51 8 in 2011 the mean percentage difference is larger in 2011 due to the increased number of lower concentration supraglacial samples the concentration of bicarbonate was found by titrating 20 ml of sample with 0 01 mol l 1 hydrochloric acid using kittiwake ph 4 5 indicator two titrations were carried out on each sample and they were accepted if the volume of hydrochloric acid added agreed within 2 ml 59 8 µeq l 1 of bicarbonate if not then a third test was performed and if two of the three tests agreed then their values were used instead the average absolute difference between the tests was 24 7 µeq l 1 of bicarbonate 5 once both the sulphate and bicarbonate concentrations had been found they were used to calculate the c ratio hco3 hco3 so4 2 brown et al 1996 the partial pressure of co2 was also calculated from the ph and bicarbonate concentration see brown 2002 eq 9 3 3 the impact of debris on the proglacial hydrograph 3 3 1 field measurements proglacial runoff was derived from water level measurements and a rating curve collected at a gauging station located on the northern lobe stream upstream of any confluences gs in fig 1 it consisted of a pressure transducer hung in a stilling well bolted onto a very large boulder see table 3 the onset hobo pressure data were compensated using air pressure data from mont de la saxe 7 6 km from the gauging station dye tracing indicates that the small outflow from the southern lobe is derived locally from only the area of that lobe fyffe 2012 so the runoff from the rest of the glacier exits via the northern lobe a high flow event in june 2011 caused damage to the well resulting in data loss between 18 06 2011 and 03 08 2011 and the repositioning of the well data was also lost between 27 08 2010 and 28 08 2010 and between 04 09 2010 and 08 09 2010 the measured stages from all time periods were adjusted to the datum of the june 2010 well so that one stage discharge rating could be applied a total of 16 rhodamine wt dye dilution gaugings were used to construct a two part rating curve with a percentage error of 14 6 see supplementary information a for further details 3 3 2 analysis of the proglacial runoff record daily hydrographs were categorised into shape categories following hannah et al 2000 1999 and swift et al 2005 the hydrograph classes were predetermined and hydrographs classified manually to allow a more direct comparison of results with other workers the runoff record was divided into 24 h periods days with the beginning of the day being the average time of minimum runoff for complete days with no rain of 11 00 in 2010 daily hydrographs were classified as either i diurnal a peak in the middle of the day and lower flows at the beginning and end ii rising iii falling or iv unknown hydrograph steady or could not be assigned to one of the other categories if a hydrograph fell between two categories then the most prominent feature of the hydrograph was used to determine its category only complete days with no rain were categorised mean hydrographs for categories i to iii are in fig 2 following swift et al 2005 specific parameters were calculated for each of the hydrographs classified as diurnal as well as averages for each year see table 5 the 2010 and 2011 melt season hydrographs were delimited into phases based on the dominant hydrograph type fig 3 the percentage of days of each hydrograph type diurnal rising or falling not including unknown hydrographs was calculated for a running 10 day period with the mid day of the 10 day period used as the phase boundary the early season period is phase 1 later in the season from the beginning of july onwards hydrographs are classified as either phase 2 when more than 50 of the hydrographs are diurnally classified or phase 3 when less than 50 of the hydrographs are diurnally classified to find the lag time between peak air temperature and discharge the time between maximum air temperature and maximum discharge was calculated with the day starting at 11 00 lag times were also calculated between maximum air temperature and minimum conductivity and between minimum conductivity and maximum discharge only diurnally classified conductivity data defined as having a minimum conductivity in the middle of the day and higher values before and after this were used in this analysis lag times were also calculated statistically using a lag correlation between hourly discharge and air temperature records from lws and uws the discharge record was moved back in time in hourly increments and the correlation repeated up to a lag of 24 h with the lag time with the highest correlation coefficient giving the average lag time the records were also split into 10 day periods and the process repeated to reveal seasonal changes only the 2010 record was used in the statistical analysis due to its completeness and all days were included 4 results 4 1 the influence of debris on supraglacial and proglacial water chemistry 4 1 1 supraglacial water chemistry supraglacial water chemistry results are given in table 4 with sulphate and bicarbonate concentrations shown in fig 4 there is a distinction in bicarbonate concentrations between the two largest streams on the upper glacier s12 and s14 which demonstrated lower bicarbonate concentrations and also lower ssc and most of the other samples which had bicarbonate concentrations around 300 µeq l 1 note that although s15 was close to s12 and s15 it had a smaller mainly debris covered catchment sp5 a small pond had the highest bicarbonate concentrations with the lower glacier streams s1 and s7 also showing elevated concentrations the average supraglacial stream bicarbonate concentration was much lower 286 µeq l 1 than the proglacial stream values 783 µeq l 1 in 2010 and 603 µeq l 1 in 2011 there was not a distinction in sulphate concentrations between the larger upglacier streams and the smaller streams on the lower glacier however the sulphate concentration of sp5 was particularly high 87 µeq l 1 with the values for the c4 and c8 lakes also high compared to the supraglacial streams the elevated sulphate concentrations measured at ws5 are likely because the samples were taken in early june 2010 when its catchment was snow covered since snow sample 3 demonstrated elevated sulphate concentrations the mean sulphate concentration of supraglacial stream measurements of 16 µeq l 1 was an order of magnitude lower than gauging station values 4 1 2 proglacial water chemistry the concentration of sulphate ions measured at the proglacial stream was high compared with other clean glaciers table 6 with values most similar to the debris covered dokriani glacier outside of the monsoon season the highest values of sulphate on miage glacier were either when there was a pulse of ion and sediment rich water 09 06 2010 474 μeq l 1 corresponding to a fall in discharge and a peak in conductivity ssc and bicarbonate concentration or when discharges were low during cold weather e g 367 μeq l 1 on 20 06 2010 and 383 μeq l 1 on 15 09 2011 even though the highest sulphate concentration measured was on 09 06 10 the delayed flow sulphate concentrations were still high even in mid summer table 4 the variation between different times of year was small with the difference between mean june and mean july august concentrations being only 5 µeq l 1 in 2010 and 25 µeq l 1 in 2011 this contrasts with haut glacier d arolla and austre brøggerbreen where june sulphate concentrations were at least twice those later in the season tranter et al 1996 the relationship between sulphate and discharge was generally weak so in 2010 the only relationship with discharge was in september when the sulphate concentration increased as discharge decreased p value 0 016 r2 37 3 although in 2011 this negative relationship was also found in june p value 0 009 r2 27 4 and more strongly in july and august p value 0 017 r2 58 4 even taking account of the elevated supraglacial bicarbonate concentrations section 4 1 the mean and range of proglacial values are still high compared to clean glaciers table 6 the values are most similar to the debris covered batura glacier and dokriani glacier during the monsoon season slightly above the values for grimsvötn and below those from the icing at scott turnerbreen as for sulphate bicarbonate concentrations were highest either in june 2010 when there was a pulse of sediment and ion rich water 913 μeq l 1 on 09 06 2010 at 10 05 or during recessional flow for instance 1092 µeq l 1 at 10 30 on 22 06 2010 corresponding with a particularly low discharge of 1 65 m3 s 1 the bicarbonate concentration decreased over the season in 2010 but this was not mirrored in 2011 unlike sulphate the bicarbonate concentration never had a significant relationship with discharge in 2010 or 2011 4 2 the impact of debris on the proglacial hydrograph the runoff and meteorological conditions in 2010 and 2011 are given in fig 5 average values are calculated for the melt season with 2011 meteorological averages found for the same dates as the 2010 record see table 2 4 2 1 hydrograph shape classification hydrograph shape classification table 7 revealed that the majority of hydrographs were diurnal in both years with almost as many rising but fewer falling hydrographs of the diurnally classified hydrographs in 2010 2011 7 6 were found in june 14 no data in july 8 16 in august and 3 3 in september even diurnally classified hydrographs often did not smoothly rise or fall and could exhibit a flattened or variable peak hannah et al 2000 and swift et al 2005 classified daily hydrographs from haut glacier d arolla into shape categories with hannah et al 1999 conducting similar analysis on taillon glacier runoff the haut glacier d arolla and taillon glacier runoff records were classified using principle component analysis meaning the hydrograph classes were statistically derived and unique to the runoff record a direct comparison with the miage glacier classes although predetermined and conducted manually to aid comparison should therefore be treated with caution nevertheless table 7 shows miage glacier has fewer diurnal hydrographs over the season than was classified for haut glacier d arolla in 1998 and 1999 miage glacier had a similar number of diurnal hydrographs to taillon glacier and haut glacier d arolla in 1989 but some of the building late peaked hydrographs which rise to a peak around 24 00 would have been classed as diurnal for miage glacier 4 2 2 the amplitude of diurnal hydrographs the diurnal runoff amplitude described by qdmax qdmin can be compared to other clean and debris covered glaciers tables 8 and 9 the range for miage glacier from 1 2 in june phase 1 to 2 12 in phase 3a is similar to dokriani glacier slightly higher than gangotri glacier and always higher than dunagiri glacier the aforementioned glaciers are all debris covered and their values including those of miage glacier are all lower than those given for the clean qiyi and parlung no 4 glaciers although the glacier area may alter the discharge ratio the glacier area of miage glacier and parlung no 4 are very similar table 10 values of qdsdamp found by averaging values for peaked hydrographs of different magnitudes were also given by swift et al 2005 for haut glacier d arolla the swift et al 2005 values ranged from 0 83 2 40 equating to qdmax qdmin of 1 83 3 40 which appears relatively high compared to values for both miage glacier and the other debris covered glaciers similarly found values of qdsdamp given by hannah et al 1999 for taillon glacier ranged from 0 434 to 2 649 equating to qdmax qdmin of 1 434 3 649 again giving high values compared to the debris covered glaciers this suggests that the diurnal runoff amplitude of debris covered glaciers is less than clean glaciers 4 2 3 lag time analysis lag times between air temperature and peak discharge determined by analysis of daily hydrographs are shown in table 11 the mean and minimum lag times of the debris covered glaciers are greater than that of the clean glaciers the maximum lag time was greatest for parlung no 4 glacier but this value could have been influenced by colder weather in october lag times were also derived by conducting lag correlations between discharge and air temperature in 2010 all correlations were statistically significant p 0 05 with correlations generally stronger with uws than lws the lag time for the whole discharge time series was between 9 and 10 h uws relationship table 12 compares statistically derived lag times for a range of glaciers the two debris covered glaciers miage glacier and keqikaer glacier have longer minimum lag times than all of the clean glaciers baounet glacier and haut glacier d arolla are both temperate alpine glaciers similar to miage glacier and both their maximum and minimum lag times are much lower than the values for miage glacier by 14 15 h and 4 7 h respectively despite the small dataset there is therefore evidence that there is a greater lag time between peak air temperature and peak runoff for the debris covered glaciers compared to the clean glaciers lag times from peak air temperature to minimum conductivity 3 47 and 2 75 h in 2010 and 2011 respectively were shorter than between peak air temperature and peak runoff 6 34 and 7 92 h in 2010 and 2011 respectively when both diurnally classified proglacial discharge and diurnally classified conductivity data were available only 8 days in total see fig 6 there was often a delay between the time of lowest conductivity and highest discharge resulting in discharge and conductivity rising in phase for a few hours the mean time between minimum conductivity and maximum discharge in 2010 2011 was 2 5 4 25 h fig 6 shows the temporal change in the relationship between conductivity and discharge on individual days the clearest cyclic hysteresis is anticlockwise resulting in conductivity increasing with discharge in the evening or sometimes high but variable discharge and increasing conductivity for conductivity to increase with discharge the solute load must be increasing at a greater rate than discharge fountain 1992 4 2 4 runoff fluctuations and their relation to meteorological variations 4 2 4 1 phase 1 early season runoff during the entire phase 1 period in 2010 and prior to 13 06 11 in the 2011 record discharges generally remained low average 3 2 m3 s 1 and 2 1 m3 s 1 for 2010 and 2011 respectively and although diurnal hydrographs dominated they had a small amplitude in 2010 variations over a few days had a larger magnitude than diurnal fluctuations in 2011 discharges rose on 13 06 11 but did not rise substantially until 15 06 11 followed by the large flood event on 18 06 11 caused by very heavy rainfall fig 5 in both years air temperatures during phase 1 periods were lower than average 4 2 4 2 phase 2 diurnal runoff during phase 2 in both years the discharge increased alongside an increase in the percentage of diurnal hydrographs and the mean amplitude of diurnal hydrographs to 5 0 m3 s 1 in both years fig 7 a and b these changes were driven by consistently fine weather with increased air temperatures and only occasional rainfall mean lws air temperature in phase 2 was greater than average by 4 4 c in 2010 and 2 3 c in 2011 the flows in 2010 did not increase until around three days after the rise in air temperature although within the phase 2 period the discharge was more responsive to meteorological changes e g the shape of the hydrograph peak relates to the hourly modelled ablation on 11 07 10 see fig 7a 4 2 4 3 phase 3 hydrographs with reverse asymmetry the phase 3 runoff in 2010 begins around 16 07 10 fig 7c the overall discharge magnitude was similar to average 5 9 m3 s 1 average 5 3 m3 s 1 with the discharge amplitude larger than average 2 7 m3 s 1 for diurnal hydrographs only with 3 4 m3 s 1 the average the lag time to peak discharge for diurnal hydrographs 4 46 h was shorter than average and for phase 2 but including all hydrographs was much longer 8 17 h the mean air temperature at lws was within 1 c of the average the phase 3 runoff in 2011 occurred both before phase 3a and after phase 3b fig 7d the phase 2 runoff period the mean discharge of the phase 3a and 3b runoff for diurnal and all hydrographs was higher 3a and lower 3b than average but by not much more than 1 m3 s 1 the discharge amplitude was higher than average using only diurnal hydrographs in phase 3a but lower than average in phase 3b using both diurnal and all hydrographs the lag time of phase 3a and 3b around 9 10 h was higher than phase 2 and the seasonal average the mean air temperature at lws of the phase 3a and 3b periods was also within 1 c of the average phase 3 runoff tends to show reverse asymmetry in 2010 and 2011 see fig 7c the increasingly warm air temperatures between 30 07 10 and 01 08 10 lead to a gradually rising hydrograph then after the precipitation inputs passed and the weather cooled the runoff decreases warmer temperatures lead to gradually increasing discharges but a decrease in air temperature leads to a sharp runoff decrease in 2011 fig 7d shows the rise in night time air temperature on 28 08 10 results in a rising hydrograph on 29 08 10 in the following days the discharge does become diurnal but the minimum flow has a clearer trough than the maximum flow has a peak 5 discussion 5 1 the influence of debris on supraglacial and proglacial water chemistry the proglacial concentration of sulphate and bicarbonate ions was high for miage glacier compared with clean glaciers section 4 1 2 the concentration of sulphate ions can be influenced by a snowpack sulphate derived from deposition of mainly the sea salt aerosol tranter et al 1996 b contact of water with sediment at the bed resulting in sulphide oxidation tranter et al 1993b or c by the influence of groundwater the influence of supraglacial debris on sulphate concentrations is not known from previous studies sulphate values in snow were low with a mean concentration of 76 µeq l 1 compared to 215 µeq l 1 on average in the proglacial stream in 2011 table 4 most supraglacial streams had very low sulphate concentrations demonstrating that they mainly contained ice melt there was not a clear distinction in sulphate concentrations between the upper and lower glacier supraglacial stream samples suggesting that supraglacial debris does not increase the sulphate concentrations however a higher sulphate concentration was measured in the small pond sp5 suggesting that the longer sediment contact was conducive to coupled sulphide oxidation and carbonate dissolution reactions which produce bicarbonate and sulphate ions brown 2002 however the small ponds were not prevalent enough to be a significant ion source similar conditions likely occur in the larger lakes c4 and c8 although meltwater from their large ice cliffs would lower ion concentrations the lake ion concentrations were lower than proglacial values with lakes only providing ions to proglacial runoff upon drainage therefore apart from the early season snowmelt most proglacial sulphate is not of a supraglacial origin the lower glacier streams draining debris covered catchments had higher bicarbonate concentrations than the upper streams draining mainly clean ice contact of meltwater with debris possibly while within the debris matrix therefore results in enough water rock interaction to enrich the bicarbonate concentration through acid hydrolysis the greater sediment availability may also lead to a higher ssc allowing in stream acid hydrolysis and the production of bicarbonate ions even in ice walled streams tranter et al 1993a ice cliff meltwater may reduce bicarbonate concentrations e g at s5 which is a stream bounded by ice cliffs in a thickly debris covered catchment concentrations were higher in sp5 again suggesting that small ponds may be an ion source although debris enriched the supraglacial bicarbonate concentration the average supraglacial stream concentration 286 µeq l 1 was still considerably lower than the average gauging station concentration 783 µeq l 1 in 2010 and 603 µeq l 1 in 2011 given the difference in supraglacial and proglacial concentrations of both bicarbonate and sulphate concentrations there must therefore be a significant proportion of the proglacial concentration produced instream from groundwater or at the bed it is most likely that the proglacial ions are produced from reactions within a distributed hydrological system which underlies the lower glacier since there is already evidence of its existence from dye tracing fyffe et al 2019 the ions could also be produced if water spent time in the sedimentary raised bed underlying the lower glacier pavan et al 1999 cited in deline 2002 both of these environments would contain freshly comminuted rock flour and be conducive to long enough residence times to elevate sulphate concentrations tranter et al 1993b tranter and raiswell 1991 both bicarbonate and sulphate concentrations remained high throughout the melt season suggesting that a significant proportion of meltwater passed through the distributed system even in mid summer section 4 1 2 groundwater was sampled from a spring next to the valley river the dora d veny fig 1 and concentrations of sulphate and bicarbonate were very high 2959 µeq l 1 and 1361 µeq l 1 respectively with a c ratio of 0 32 however the c ratio was much lower than the lowest value measured at the proglacial stream 0 63 even if the bicarbonate concentration is artificially increased by 286 µeq l 1 to account for the average supraglacial input of bicarbonate ions the c ratio is still 0 36 the sulphate concentrations were twice the highest values found from boreholes beneath haut glacier d arolla with such high values suggesting long residence times in anoxic conditions where sulphide oxidation may be catalysed by microbial activity brown 2002 it is therefore less likely the proglacial ions are derived from groundwater at least that of a composition similar to the spring measured furthermore although bicarbonate ions can be produced within post mixing chemical reactions tranter et al 1993a the bicarbonate and sulphate ion concentrations tend to vary together although the only significant relationship was in july august 2010 they also tend to be high during low flow periods suggesting that a portion of the bicarbonate concentration is produced subglacially 5 2 the impact of debris on the proglacial hydrograph 5 2 1 the influence of supraglacial debris on proglacial discharge amplitude and lag time comparison of the lag time and diurnal discharge amplitude of debris free and debris covered glaciers sections 4 2 2 and 4 2 3 suggests that glaciers with an extensive supraglacial debris cover have a more subdued proglacial hydrograph with a smaller amplitude and longer lag time between peak air temperature and discharge compared to clean glaciers this corroborates the findings of li et al 2016 in the tibetan plateau and corresponds with the lower overall percentage of diurnal hydrographs found when comparing miage glacier and haut glacier d arolla section 4 2 1 however comparable data were only available for 6 debris covered and 6 clean glaciers for lag time analysis and 4 debris covered and 4 clean glaciers for diurnal discharge amplitude parameters the lower discharge amplitude and fewer diurnal hydrographs under average weather conditions could be due to a more subdued input or recharge hydrograph covington et al 2012 an attenuated input hydrograph from debris covered areas will be caused by the time taken for the temperature signal to be conducted down through the debris to the ice debris interface resulting in melt continuing into the evening fyffe et al 2014 especially fig 7 nicholson and benn 2006 reid and brock 2010 this increases the lag time between peak air temperature and peak melt which increases with increasing debris thickness although the runoff delay will be less than that of the average debris thickness since more melt is produced beneath thinner debris fyffe et al 2014 thus supraglacial debris will reduce the amplitude of the input hydrograph increasing the baseflow and decreasing the diurnal discharge amplitude furthermore melt must flow within the debris and or at the ice debris interface prior to reaching a supraglacial stream flow velocities in this system are unknown but it may provide a further delay to water transfer flow within streams within the debris covered region of miage glacier is known to be relatively slow fyffe et al 2019 and miles et al 2019 reported slow flow velocities between an interconnected pond system on khumbu glacier the relatively inefficient supraglacial transfer of meltwater within the debris covered region would increase the time between melt production and input into the englacial subglacial system the input hydrograph could also be attenuated by an inefficient englacial or subglacial system or the existence of a subglacial aquifer flowers 2008 flowers and clarke 2002 an inefficient englacial subglacial system was found beneath the debris covered area fyffe et al 2019 with the high proglacial bicarbonate and sulphate concentrations further confirming its existence section 5 1 the volume of storage is key to determining whether or not recharge hydrographs are altered by the glacial drainage system covington et al 2012 flowers 2008 identified that a subglacial aquifer can attenuate hydrographs and while covington et al 2012 demonstrated that although conduits and a linked cavity system did not normally modify the recharge hydrograph they could if linked to sufficiently large storage such as crevasses or lakes the inefficient englacial subglacial system could therefore alter the recharge hydrograph if the degree of storage in the system was sufficient the thickness and hydraulic conductivity of the bed materials could also have a significant influence on the discharge amplitude and lag time flowers 2008 flowers and clarke 2002 the lower miage glacier sits on a sediment bed around 50 m thick pavan et al 1999 cited in deline 2002 flowers 2008 showed that a soft sediment bed would lower the amplitude of diurnal fluctuations increasing the lag time from peak melt to peak discharge and inhibiting conduit formation compared to a hard bedded glacier flowers 2008 also showed that a subglacial aquifer beneath the sediment bed would further reduce the discharge amplitude with the effect increasing with aquifer thickness and hydraulic conductivity this is driven by higher water pressures resulting in flow being transferred from subglacial channels to be stored in the surrounding sediments with water flowing back to the channels as pressures drop hubbard et al 1995 debris covered glaciers often rest on sedimentary beds since a substantial supraglacial debris cover indicates a high rate of debris supply and high englacial debris concentrations maisch et al 1999 low sub debris melt rates and a long low angled tongue would likely also reduce the debris transport capability of meltwater streams with debris accumulating at the bed as a result the impacts of a raised bed sediment aquifer on the proglacial hydrograph may therefore also apply to other debris covered glaciers whether the lag time from peak air temperature to peak discharge is increased due to the debris cover for a particular glacier will depend upon the debris thickness distribution and its proportional cover over the glacier since these factors will influence the proportion of sub debris melt and the average delay due to conduction of heat to the ice debris interface if rapidly routed clean ice melt is a large enough proportion of runoff then the lag time may not be influenced by the debris cover since the clean ice component will provide the discharge peak c f miage glacier in section 5 3 furthermore the bed composition bedrock or sedimentary and the thickness and hydraulic conductivity of any raised bed could influence the amplitude and timing of the proglacial hydrograph flowers 2008 flowers and clarke 2002 5 2 2 runoff fluctuations and their relationship to meteorological conditions phase 1 proglacial hydrographs were subdued in both years even though most of the lower glacier was snow free from 2290 m a s l in 2010 and 2400 m a s l in 2011 and dye tracing suggested the main subglacial channel system was open and efficient from at least 09 06 10 and 10 06 11 fyffe et al 2019 on the upper glacier the snow cover would have reduced the supraglacial hydrograph amplitude and increased the meltwater travel time campbell et al 2006 willis et al 2002 meanwhile on the debris covered lower glacier meltwater inputs would be small and attenuated due to the conduction of heat through the debris fyffe et al 2014 and smaller supraglacial streams fyffe et al 2019 meltwater from the debris covered region will therefore have a subdued hydrograph and if the stream passes through the distributed system underlying the lower glacier see section 5 1 and fyffe et al 2019 it may be delayed englacially and subglacially too this means that a proglacial hydrograph with a smaller amplitude and longer lag from peak air temperature to peak discharge can result even if a large proportion of the lower glacier is snow free if the snow free region is instead debris covered phase 2 periods were found during warmer than average weather conditions by mid summer large areas of clean and dirty ice were snow free with the snowline up to approximately the base of the bionassay glacier by 31 07 10 and slightly less coverage in 2011 the removal of snowcover from the debris free area would have increased the magnitude and amplitude of meltwater inputs to the upper glacier moulins e g s12 and s14 willis et al 2002 the main subglacial drainage system remained efficient in both years and although the drainage system beneath the debris covered area increased in efficiency it was still less efficient than that emanating from higher on the glacier fyffe et al 2019 continued drainage through the distributed system is also confirmed by the proglacial sulphate and bicarbonate concentrations which remained high throughout the summer section 5 1 removal of snow from the clean and dirty ice area is therefore required to increase the amplitude of the upglacier supraglacial hydrograph and therefore lead to a clear proglacial diurnal signal phase 2 periods therefore require consistently warm and dry weather as well as the loss of snow cover from the upglacier clean ice phase 3 runoff occurred during average weather conditions and resulted in close to average proglacial discharges and diurnal amplitudes and a hydrograph with reverse asymmetry where flow increases gradually but falls quickly smeared or multiple hydrograph peaks could be caused by multiple input points with different lag times covington et al 2012 since variations in debris thickness cause variations in the time of the supraglacial hydrograph peak fyffe et al 2014 and the debris morphology leads to many smaller input points fyffe et al 2019 miles et al 2017 this may result in a flattened peak especially if cooler weather means a larger proportion of runoff is from the debris covered area the reverse asymmetry of the phase 3 runoff hydrograph is somewhat unusual a possible explanation involves percolation of meltwater into the sediment aquifer beneath the lower glacier if the input of water into the subglacial system is less than the maximum potential rate of infiltration into the aquifer which would depend upon the aquifer hydraulic conductivity the aquifer could essentially capture the drainage flowers and clarke 2002 net loss to the aquifer would be especially noticeable when most meltwater is introduced from further upglacier and inputs from the lower glacier are limited a second possible mechanism involves the overdeepening which occurs just upstream of the bend in the main tongue pavan et al 1999 cited in deline 2002 water pressures close to overburden are required for subglacial water to flow up the adverse bed slope and exit the overdeepening the rise in the pressure melting point as the water flows up the adverse bed slope can result in supercooling forming frazil ice which can reduce the hydraulic conductivity and subsequently flow rates alley et al 1998 whether or not supercooling occurs is dependent upon the riegel slope angle alley et al 1998 how close the water temperature is to the melting temperature and by water pressure variations dow et al 2014 if the riegel is steep enough water flow could be restricted especially when water pressures are lower dow et al 2014 potentially increasing hydrograph recession 5 3 the flow components of miage glacier runoff by combining the results of the hydrochemistry section 5 1 and proglacial discharge analysis section 5 2 the main flow components of miage glacier runoff can be identified fig 8 supraglacial hydrochemistry demonstrated that upper glacier clean ice melt does not tend to acquire solutes with dye tracing revealing that upper glacier meltwater is drained efficiently fyffe et al 2019 the fast transfer of this dilute clean ice melt component suggests its peak at the proglacial stream is indicated by the conductivity minimum which arrives around 3 h after peak air temperature section 4 2 4 meanwhile on the debris covered lower glacier the small supraglacial streams flow more slowly fyffe et al 2019 with meltwater acquiring bicarbonate ions due to its contact with sediment section 4 1 1 dye tracing indicated some of the lower glacier subglacial drainage pathways were inefficient fyffe et al 2019 with the high proglacial sulphate and bicarbonate concentrations confirming this section 5 1 sub debris melt will therefore likely have a greater solute concentration and take longer to arrive at the snout this explains the evening rise of conductivity with discharge shown in fig 6 the delayed debris component becomes a larger proportion of runoff in the evening and likely peaks when the discharge peaks 6 8 h after peak air temperature however since modelling suggested melt from the debris covered region provided only 27 30 of total melt fyffe et al 2014 melt from the tributary glaciers very high upglacier may constitute the remainder of the discharge peak the longer travel times of the debris component explains the observed long lag times between air temperature and peak discharge for debris covered glaciers section 4 2 3 presuming that the clean ice component peaks at the time of minimum conductivity while the debris component peaks at the time of maximum discharge then the overall delay due to the debris cover averaged over the glacier can be calculated from the difference between these times 2 5 h in 2010 and 4 25 h in 2011 based on 8 days of conductivity data several mechanisms could account for this delay section 5 2 1 including attenuation of the melt signal due to conduction of heat through the debris smaller supraglacial streams a less efficient englacial subglacial hydrological system and a sediment bed the delay due to heat conduction averaged over the glacier is around 1 2 h fyffe et al 2014 with the less efficient englacial subglacial system resulting in a delay of around 1 9 h fyffe et al 2019 supplementary information b outlines how these delays were derived since these delays are roughly equal in duration both should be included in debris covered glacier runoff models supraglacial dye tracing is needed to determine the supraglacial efficiency of debris covered glaciers while further runoff modelling would be needed to fully understand the influence of a sediment aquifer 6 conclusions supraglacial debris influences glacier hydrochemistry in two main ways firstly greater supraglacial water rock contact on the lower glacier increases the ssc and bicarbonate concentration of supraglacial lakes and streams the supraglacial debris only influences sulphate concentrations where residence times are long e g in small ponds secondly since the debris cover inhibits the formation of a channelised network beneath thickly debris covered areas fyffe et al 2019 it indirectly increases the proglacial bicarbonate and sulphate concentrations by increasing the proportion of water which is routed through an inefficient subglacial system the miage glacier runoff hydrograph is a product of the melt signal and its alteration by the hydrological system since the supraglacial debris attenuates the melt signal fyffe et al 2014 and results in an inefficient subglacial system fed by smaller input streams fyffe et al 2019 this means the flow component composed of sub debris melt has a longer lag time than the flow component from the clean and dirty ice which is routed efficiently from the mid glacier this increases the discharge baseflow and increases the lag time between peak air temperature and peak runoff although the raised sediment bed may also play a role in attenuating the proglacial hydrograph discharge and conductivity commonly showed anti clockwise hysteresis with conductivity and discharge rising in phase for a few hours this suggests that the dilute melt component likely peaks before the more ion rich debris and tributary components the delaying effect of the debris also means that both a snow free upper glacier and particularly warm weather are required for diurnal hydrographs to dominate under average weather conditions rising or falling hydrographs dominate and the hydrograph tends to rise more slowly than it falls resulting in reverse asymmetry in the hydrograph these conclusions show that the hydrochemistry and proglacial runoff signal of debris covered glaciers differs from clean glaciers given that data for comparison was from a relatively small sample of glaciers work to increase this sample size and differentiate the influence of specific catchment and debris characteristics on the proglacial runoff signal would be welcomed these findings will be relevant to other catchments with debris covered glaciers and those that are likely to become more debris covered in the future e g bhambri et al 2011 bolch et al 2008 lambrecht et al 2011 since receding glaciers may become more debris covered the influence of supraglacial debris on the runoff hydrograph should be accounted for within future runoff models the present study is a pioneering first step towards quantifying the influence of debris and glacier characteristics on supraglacial and proglacial hydrographs it will inform future work involving the direct comparison of hydrographs from multiple glaciers using a consistent methodology and the construction of a physically based hydrological model which takes into the account the influence of the debris on runoff this would allow the prediction of runoff given changes to the debris cover declaration of

drainage irrigation systems and many other environmental agricultural and industrial installations reynolds et al 1983 there is a high demand for kfs data its evaluation is preferable to be done in situ a popular device to measure the kfs is the head well permeameter such as the guelph permeameter however it is an analog equipment based on a mariotte s bottle that requires full attention and training to be manually operated where the reading of the flux values q in cm3 min is time consuming and costly in this paper we describe a device with a digital readout to measure the steady state rate of water level change rs in order to obtain qs and kfs the method is based on the monitoring of the vacuum variation of the mariotte s bottle our results show no statistical differences between the measurements values of manual and automatic recording using paired t test in addition our device identifies measurement artifacts due to the variation of the ambient temperature during measurements the necessary accuracy for the digitalization method becomes feasible due to the availability of accurate piezoelectric transducers micro electro mechanical system mems automating and digitizing these processes will reduce time costs and increase the accuracy and availability of data the device can be directly adapted to commercially available head well permeameters as shown in our

determinations of soil and solution water fluxes kfs is a crucial parameter to design irrigation and drainage and irrigation systems to predict runoff to select a place to install sanitary landfills septic tanks and many other environmental agricultural and industrial installations reynolds et al 1983 guelph permeameter gp is a type of constant head well permeameter used primarily to obtain kfs the method is based on a three dimensional flow analysis for steady state infiltration obtained by ponding one or more constant heads of water in a cylindrical well augered into the unsaturated zone reynolds and elrick 2002 the traditional head well permeameter is an analog equipment that requires full attention and training to be manually operated and the acquisition of the flux values q is time consuming and costly in this work we present the hardware and software development of a microcontroller based device to automatically acquire the water level rate change r and therefore q as the reservoir is a cylinder different from previous proposals fatehnia et al 2016 di prima 2015 salas garcía et al 2017 the presented device has been field tested and has the additional advantage to be easily incorporated to standard procedures and tools well known by researchers agronomist hydrogeologist and technicians that are used to measure q and calculate kfs 2 method and materials 2 1 principle of operation basically the method for measuring kfs consists of digging a cylindrical well hole with defined geometry in the unsaturated soil zone and recording the stationary rate of water recharge while maintaining a constant level of water kanwar et al 1990 a simplified functional diagram of a head well permeameter is shown in fig 1 the water reservoirs are made with high impact polycarbonate acting as a mariotte s bottle the pressure at the bottom of the air tube inlet is the atmospheric pressure if the pressure were higher the air would not enter the reservoir if the water level in the well becomes lower at the air tube entrance it allows air to enter the reservoir as a consequence the water level head in the well is maintained constant the reservoir tube graduation is scaled in millimeter allowing the measurement of the water level in the reservoir the level of the water in the well is kept constant at the position of the bottom of the air tube the water level in the reservoir is maintained by the vacuum created in the volume of the reservoir above the measured water level when the water level in the well falls the air can enter in the air tube and the vacuum is relieved therefore the water in the reservoir is also released maintaining the water level in the well to estimate the kfs eq 1 can be used using one head as described by elrick et al 1989 1 k fs cq s 2 π h 2 c π r 2 α 2 π h where kfs is the field soil hydraulic saturated conductivity cm3 min qs is the measured steady state rate of water flow cm3 min necessary to maintain a constant depth of

sensor the feasibility of the proposed measurement process is due to the accuracy and stability of the pressure determination therefore we present in detail the piezoelectric transducer and the calibration process the development of sensors based on micro electro mechanical system mems technology had provided significant benefit to piezoelectric transducers increasing the performance significantly and decreasing relatively the costs tanner 2009 the basis of mems technology is the capability of build and control mechanical and movable structures using integrated circuit ic processing technology the model of the piezoelectric sensor used in this work is the ms5803 01ba according to the manufacturer s specifications it is designed to operate with a measurement range of 10 1300 mbar in the temperature range of 40 to 85 c with a temperature sensor also integrated in the package measurement specialties 2015 the piezoelectric mems transducer is located inside a polished stainless steel cylinder 4 4 mm in diameter inside the cylinder the piezoelectric transducer is covered by a double layer of ke1052 silicone gel commonly used in the industry as a flexible encapsulation of electronic components sheng and colino 2004 the transparent gel layer covering the transducer is about 1 mm thick and it is intended to protect the sensitive element and the wires connecting the sensor die to the encapsulation contacts the second layer of gel receives a charge of titanium dioxide tio2 this oxide is an antimicrobial agent that acts by photocatalytic effect degrading organic molecules in the presence of light and thus preventing the formation of biofilms and consequently incrustations ruffolo et al 2013 the transducer element which converts the pressure signal into an electrical signal is a rigid silicon membrane constructed in a bridge configuration and made with mems technology the signal is amplified and transferred to a 24 bit σ δ analog to digital converter adc the adc can be configured with five oversampling rates 256 512 1024 2048 and 4096 to increase the signal to noise ratio when operating with an oversampling of 256 the conversion time is approximately 0 5 ms the sensor is configured to communicate using the i2c where the results of adc conversions are sent in the form of 24 bit words after passing through a second order digital filter 2 3 sensor calibration each sensor ic is individually checked at the factory for two temperature values and two pressure values measurement specialties 2011a as a result six coefficients are extracted to compensate for process and temperature variations these six values are stored in registers of a non volatile memory of the prom type of 128 bits in length the registers shall be read by the firmware and used in the conversion to obtain the calibrated temperature in celsius degree and pressure in mbar in a register w7 an error detection code of type crc 4 is stored to ensure correct reading of the values of the calibration coefficients measurement specialties 2011b from the sensor specifications datasheet measurement specialties 2015 the absolute accuracy is 1 0 mbar and the resolution is 0 065 mbar osr 256 according to the manufacturer there is an error associated with the sensor voltage supply level for a constant pressure of 1000 mbar in this project the voltage supplied to the module was 3 3 v and at this voltage the estimated pressure and temperature error is approximately 0 5 mbar and 0 1 c a calibration methodology similar to the one adopted by the british geological survey bgs sorensen and butcher 2011 was used the calibration apparatus consists of a transparent acrylic tube 1 0 inch in diameter by 1 5 m in length the procedure and experimental arrangement for calibration are described in detail elsewhere but are summarized here barmak and cernicchiaro 2017 at the back of the acrylic tube was fixed a measuring tape with a millimeter scale to allow the measurement of the height of the water column inside the tube at the lower end of the tube a t connection was fixed where one of the outlets is connected to a ball valve to allow the control of the height of fluid inside the tube and in the second outlet was fixed a silicone hose that fits to the stainless steel cylinder of the pressure sensor a mercury thermometer with scale graduation of 1 c was fixed inside the tube two printed circuit boards pcbs were designed and used to characterize the pressure sensor one board was used to read the height of the water column hydrostatic pressure and the other to read the atmospheric pressure value acting as a barometer following the manufacturer s orientation after welding the sensors they were left to rest for at least 48 h to relieve thermal stresses induced by the welding process 2 4 digital acquisition and processing interface the first prototype was built as a standalone board based on the atmega 328p microcontroller atmel 2018 it works as an individual basic interface suitable for laboratory measurements fig 2 but it was not practical and sturdy enough for field deployments in addition the necessity to use it with laptops in the field environment has proven to be an expensive and fragile option to improve some features and maintain the low cost we decided to upgrade the project to the open source platform arduino using the arduino mega 2560 board arduino mega 2560 2018 arduino shields are modular circuit boards commercially available that are mechanical electrical and logically compatible with the arduino boards in order to provide it with extra functionality in this case we developed a shield incorporating the following devices display 16 2 lcd with backlight memory micro sd card module real time clock rtc ds1307 bluetooth hc 05 module the arduino mega board can be programmed in c language with the arduino integrated development environment ide the software connects to the arduino hardware allowing to upload programs and communication tests the board is powered via the usb connection with a standard battery pack to work on the field the board has 256 kb of flash memory for storing code of which 8 kb is used for the bootloader 8 kb of ram and 4 kb of eeprom the device block diagram is shown in fig 3 the circuit is assembled in a hermetic box with 2 buttons start and stop functions a type b usb connector and a hydraulic connection for interconnecting the sensor to the mariotte s reservoir via a silicone hose the display shows two states measurement and standby a transparent front panel protects the hardware against the ambient conditions during the measurement the display presents the file being recorded the temperature c the time stamp and the pressure mbar measurements performed at programmable intervals the battery backed real time clock rtc module allows keeping track of date and time even if the microcontroller is reprogrammed or in the event of a power supply failure each sampled data is stored with a timestamp in a micro sd card connected via serial peripheral interface spi protocol to the microcontroller the device works as a standalone unit but can be remotely controlled through a bluetooth link allowing a redundancy on the collected data during the field trials we used an android phone along with the bluetooth spp application available on google play 2 5 experimental setup the field data were collected during the measurements carried out in são luís island maranhão state in brazil it was done in two types of soil acrisols and arenosol with different structure and texture measurements were made in the field using a commercial guelph permeameter soil moisture usa in wells excavated using a bucket auger of five centimeters of diameter the depths of 20 and 60 cm below the soil surface were selected to be measured we measured using two constant water heads from the bottom of the well 5 cm and then 10 cm the rate of water flow out of the permeameter and into the soil measured by monitoring the rate of fall of the water level in the mariotte s bottle scale and manually recorded once a minute additionally our device was set to automatically record time and pressure in the reservoir in 10 s intervals when the rate of fall becomes constant in time the flow rate q has reached the steady state rate these values of q were used to calculate the kfs eq 1 the measurement time ranged from 15 to 120 min depending on soil permeability the guelph permeameter operation is well described in the equipment manual soilmoisture equipment corp 2010 the equipment is intended to be transported assembled and operated by one person we show the guelph permeameter mounted on the field in fig 4 in detail we have the interface device connected to the guelph reservoir and a tripod base that mechanically supports the structure the device is connected with a silicone hose to the guelph reservoir cap this inlet is generally not used and it is intended to fill the reservoir with water using a pump the device hydraulic connection is airtight and does not affect guelph s normal operation in order to verify the precision and usability of the digital method all measurements were recorded simultaneously with the manual procedure the data recording can be commenced operated using the start stop buttons or remotely via any bluetooth equipped device i e cell phone tablet or laptop the data is recorded on the internal sd card and redundantly on the remote device in the manual procedure we averaged the final values of variation of level divided by time during the phase considered steady state to calculate the water flow q in the automatically recorded data we select the same interval that changed from 3 to 10 min and adjust a linear regression the angular coefficient is the q value to calculated kfs we used the equation for a single read eq 1 the α parameters elrick et al 1989 in this study were based on field evaluation of soil structure and are shown in table 1 the statistical comparison between kfs values estimated using manual and digital data were performed using a paired t test madansky 1988 r c team 2018 additionally we estimated the average and standard deviation for individual evaluation of fluxes q depicted in a 1 1 regression plot fig 6 the linear regression coefficients and the determination coefficient r2 was also calculated and presented the kfs values ranged from very low to very high values table 1 following the class classification criteria proposed by schoeneberger et al 2012 and schoeneberger et al 2012 the higher values are around the limit of evaluation of the guelph permeameter soilmoisture equipment corp 2010 the arenosols and acrisols are the soil classes that predominate in the island of são luís brazil and they are mostly classified in texture class like sandy or sandy loam however the size of the grain and arrange of the soil structure and presence of voids provoke this large variation in kfs in the studied region it is very difficult to forecast the kfs using texture values and it is strongly recommended to evaluate the saturated hydraulic conductivity in the field 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 sensor accuracy and stability the accuracy of the transducers was evaluated through a series of six measurements where the water column was sequentially set to the following heights 10 20 50 200 500 and 1000 mm each height was held static for a total of 60 min preceded by an interval of 30 min in order to allow the balance and stability of the system the sampling rate has been set to 1 hz linear regression was performed to calculate from the measured points the height of the liquid column placed inside the tube and the values read by the pressure sensor a calibration factor to convert the expressed quantity into units of pressure mbar for a height of the liquid in millimeters we characterized the drift of the sensor response given a fixed pressure value for a relatively long period two experiments were performed first a water column of 12 1 mm was applied to the sensor for a period of 12 h and in the second experiment a water column of 1000 1 mm was applied for the same period of 12 h the results show that the largest errors δ were close to 2 mm barmak and cernicchiaro 2017 3 2 comparison of the methods in the manual method the water level in the reservoir is obtained by reading the scale stamped on the inner reservoir tube at regular time intervals as a suggested in the guelph manual soilmoisture equipment corp 2010 the device was set to automatically record time pressure and temperature in the reservoir in 10 s intervals in our experiments we simultaneously started the acquisition in the digital device there is no interference between the two procedures the difference of readings at consecutive intervals divided by the time interval equals the rate of fall of water in the reservoir the steady state rate of fall r of water is defined until the rate of fall does not change significantly in consecutive time intervals the measurements were performed in harsh environmental conditions fig 5 and diverse soils permeabilities due to the permeable soils characteristic the measures could take from minutes to two hours in very permeable soils the rate of fall of water is very fast difficulting manual acquisition in both cases it is possible to compare the standard deviation to notice an increment of the precision of the measurements in the digital method and to see the smaller standard deviation of the automatic acquisition in the sandy acrisols table 1 the kfs values ranged from very low to very high values table 1 following the class classification criteria proposed by schoeneberger et al 2012 the higher values are around the limit of evaluation of the guelph permeameter soilmoisture equipment corp 2010 the arenosols and acrisols are the soil classes that predominate in the island of são luís brazil and they are mostly classified in texture class like sandy or sandy loam however the size of the grain and arrangement of the soil structure and presence of voids provoke this large variation in kfs in the studied region it is very difficult to forecast the kfs using texture values and it is strongly recommended to evaluate the saturated hydraulic conductivity in the field the calculation of kfs is not only dependent of the steady state of fall rate but also is related with the size of the reservoir used the hydraulic head used and also the soil shape factor a which is dependent on the soil texture and structure reynolds and elrick 2002 our kfs measurements ranged from 1 8 to 4 5 cm min 1 table 1 it shows that the measurement works well in very slow to very fast rates we also tested two hydraulic heads 5 and 10 cm and also the results very satisfactory for both heads moreover we also tested two marriotte s reservoir in the guelph device with success table 1 the automatic device is quite essential to accurate measurements in very high steady state rates when the water drop in the reservoir is fast wherein the manual mode it needs two operators one to read every 15 s and the other to record the values the comparison between the manually and digitally recorded steady state rate of water flow qs evaluated from data variation in the marriotte s reservoir shows high correlation value r2 0 999 and no statistical difference were observed between the procedures p 0 21 small standard deviations indicated by the smaller vertical bars fig 6 almost not visible due to the small scale indicated more precise measurements in the microcontroller based device automatic method data the variability of pressure in mariotte reservoir due bubbling does not have a significant influence in the linear fitting of the digital measurement the large data set in the digital measurement dilute the disturbance due to bubbling 3 3 measurement artifact a remarkable result obtained during our analysis was to identify a measurement artifact due not to the digitize process but to the head well permeameter technique itself there are reports that under some conditions water instead of flowing out of the marriott s reservoir and hence the indication of water level decrease the inverse occurs our device has a temperature sensor and continuously records the temperature in the air of the marriotte s reservoir it is possible to identify a correlation with the decrease in ambient temperature with a negative pressure gradient in the marriotte s reservoir an example can be seen in fig 7 it is important to point out that these phenomena occur only when a relatively rapid temperature variation few celsius degrees occurs simultaneously with a running measurement although it may be an eventual condition it can induce error and can be easily identified by visual inspection of the temperature and pressure data when this situation occurs the system displays a warning message to the operator the same reasoning can be applied to abrupt variations in atmospheric pressure consequently a second pressure sensor for the simultaneous monitoring of atmospheric pressure can be a system upgrade the atmospheric pressure can be monitored by an external device or even through an app in a cell phone for example 4 conclusion we have presented the design and construction of a device for digital readout of variation of the water levels in the marriotte s reservoir in well permeameters in order to obtain the field hydraulic saturated soil conductivity the device has a memory card sd card a real time clock a communication link via bluetooth a usb port and a display preliminary laboratory and field comparisons showed no statistical difference in the reservoir fluxes evaluated with those measured in the traditional manual mode the main contributions of this work were to automate data acquisition and experimentally demonstrate that the variation of the negative air pressure sustaining the column of water in the mariotte s tube is directly proportional to the flow of water the precision of the pressure variation measurement determines the precision of the measurement process the digital data acquisition becomes feasible due to the availability of new piezoelectric transducers with robustness reliability cost and precision characteristics needed for the task there is no available digital method for this measurement in the market or in the literature as far as the authors knowledge the temperature of the marriotte s reservoir in a head well permeameter can be affected by local conditions of the experimental setup like shade insolation wind etc therefore as our results demonstrate the air temperature in the reservoir may have a strong influence on the accuracy of measurements and should be monitored locally declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments the

the second experiment a water column of 1000 1 mm was applied for the same period of 12 h the results show that the largest errors δ were close to 2 mm barmak and cernicchiaro 2017 3 2 comparison of the methods in the manual method the water level in the reservoir is obtained by reading the scale stamped on the inner reservoir tube at regular time intervals as a suggested in the guelph manual soilmoisture equipment corp 2010 the device was set to automatically record time pressure and temperature in the reservoir in 10 s intervals in our experiments we simultaneously started the acquisition in the digital device there is no interference between the two procedures the difference of readings at consecutive intervals divided by the time interval equals the rate of fall of water in the reservoir the steady state rate of fall r of water is defined until the rate of fall does not change significantly in consecutive time intervals the measurements were performed in harsh environmental conditions fig 5 and diverse soils permeabilities due to the permeable soils characteristic the measures could take from minutes to two hours in very permeable soils the rate of fall of water is very fast difficulting manual acquisition in both cases it is possible to compare the standard deviation to notice an increment of the precision of the measurements in the digital method and to see the smaller standard deviation of the automatic acquisition in the sandy acrisols table 1 the kfs values ranged from very low to very high values table 1 following the class classification criteria proposed by schoeneberger et al 2012 the higher values are around the limit of evaluation of the guelph permeameter soilmoisture equipment corp 2010 the arenosols and acrisols are the soil classes that predominate in the island of são luís brazil and they are mostly classified in texture class like sandy or sandy loam however the size of the grain and arrangement of the soil structure and presence of voids provoke this large variation in kfs in the studied region it is very difficult to forecast the kfs using texture values and it is strongly recommended to evaluate the saturated hydraulic conductivity in the field the calculation of kfs is not only dependent of the steady state of fall rate but also is related with the size of the reservoir used the hydraulic head used and also the soil shape factor a which is dependent on the soil texture and structure reynolds and elrick 2002 our kfs measurements ranged from 1 8 to 4 5 cm min 1 table 1 it shows that the measurement works well in very slow to very fast rates we also tested two hydraulic heads 5 and 10 cm and also the results very satisfactory for both heads moreover we also tested two marriotte s reservoir in the guelph device with success table 1 the automatic device is quite essential to accurate measurements in very high steady state rates when the water drop in the reservoir is fast wherein the manual mode it needs two operators one to read every 15 s and the other to record the values the comparison between the manually and digitally recorded steady state rate of water flow qs evaluated from data variation in the marriotte s reservoir shows high correlation value r2 0 999 and no statistical difference were observed between the procedures p 0 21 small standard deviations indicated by the smaller vertical bars fig 6 almost not visible due to the small scale indicated more precise measurements in the microcontroller based device automatic method data the variability of pressure in mariotte reservoir due bubbling does not have a significant influence in the linear fitting of the digital measurement the large data set in the digital measurement dilute the disturbance due to bubbling 3 3 measurement artifact a remarkable result obtained during our analysis was to identify a measurement artifact due not to the digitize process but to the head well permeameter technique itself there are reports that under some conditions water instead of flowing out of the marriott s reservoir and hence the indication of water level decrease the inverse occurs our device has a temperature sensor and continuously records the temperature in the air of the marriotte s reservoir it is possible to identify a correlation with the decrease in ambient temperature with a negative pressure gradient in the marriotte s reservoir an example can be seen in fig 7 it is important to point out that these phenomena occur only when a relatively rapid temperature variation few celsius degrees occurs simultaneously with a running measurement although it may be an eventual condition it can induce error and can be easily identified by visual inspection of the temperature and pressure data when this situation occurs the system displays a warning message to the operator the same reasoning can be applied to abrupt variations in atmospheric pressure consequently a second pressure sensor for the simultaneous monitoring of atmospheric pressure can be a system upgrade the atmospheric pressure can be monitored by an external device or even through an app in a cell phone for example 4 conclusion we have presented the design and construction of a device for digital readout of variation of the water levels in the marriotte s reservoir in well permeameters in order to obtain the field hydraulic saturated soil conductivity the device has a memory card sd card a real time clock a communication link via bluetooth a usb port and a display preliminary laboratory and field comparisons showed no statistical difference in the reservoir fluxes evaluated with those measured in the traditional manual mode the main contributions of this work were to automate data acquisition and experimentally demonstrate that the variation of the negative air pressure sustaining the column of water in the mariotte s tube is directly proportional to the flow of water the precision of the pressure variation measurement determines the precision of the measurement process the digital data acquisition becomes feasible due to the availability of new piezoelectric transducers with robustness reliability cost and precision characteristics needed for the task there is no available digital method for this measurement in the market or in the literature as far as the authors knowledge the temperature of the marriotte s reservoir in a head well permeameter can be affected by local conditions of the experimental setup like shade insolation wind etc therefore as our results demonstrate the air temperature in the reservoir may have a strong influence on the accuracy of measurements and should be monitored locally declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments the

6277,cities across the world are increasingly utilizing green infrastructure practices as part of their stormwater management programs bioretention areas have become a popular green infrastructure practice due to their widespread success in improving water quality and reducing runoff generated from impervious surfaces several studies have demonstrated that pollutant removal performance can be improved when plants are included in bioretention design however while numerous benefits of trees in urban areas have been identified little knowledge of their contributions to stormwater management in green infrastructure currently exists to address this need a controlled mesocosm experiment was conducted to characterize the degree of stormwater treatment provided by bioretention columns planted with one of three native tree species commonly found across the eastern united states acer rubrum red maple pinus taeda loblolly pine and quercus palustris pin oak tree pollutant removal performance was compared to nonvegetated mesocosms using a semi synthetic stormwater mixture applied to the mesocosms over a period of 17 weeks the hydrologic benefits of each species were characterized using data logging scales placed below the mesocosms to compare evapotranspiration et rates and drainage in each configuration differences in pollutant removal between tree species were largely not significant indicating the dominant role of the bioretention media in mitigating dissolved and particle bound constituents mesocosms planted with red maple acer rubrum had significantly greater average et rates 3 2 mm d 1 than all other configurations attributable to plant development and increased growth and canopy size all mesocosms planted with trees had significantly higher et rates than the nonvegetated mesocosms illustrating the role of transpiration in bioretention hydrology which depending on species accounted for 8 2 37 5 of average daily water losses from the mesocosms during testing these results suggest that trees contribute to bioretention hydrology through evapotranspiration and that significant differences between species exist and are likely related to growth rate keywords bioretention urban trees evapotranspiration stormwater 1 introduction urban stormwater runoff is a significant contributor to impaired water quality and declining aquatic habitats in urban ecosystems throughout the world usepa 1999a stormwater runoff from urban areas which are characterized by concentrated human activity and widespread land use conversion to impervious cover can contain several pollutants introduced through anthropogenic activity such as nutrients metals hydrocarbons bacteria and suspended sediments derived from exposed or compromised urban soils hunt et al 2012 as a result polluted urban stormwater runoff can lead to eutrophication deteriorated riparian zones waterway closures and reduced fishing recreational and aesthetic value of downstream waters hunt et al 2006 increasingly cities and municipalities are implementing green infrastructure stormwater control measures scms and low impact development lid designs into their stormwater management programs because of their versatile design and established performance bioretention practices have become one of the most popular scms implemented to manage urban stormwater runoff in cities worldwide davis et al 2009 bioretention practices rely on both plant and soil processes to remove pollutants from urban stormwater runoff usepa 1999b though many design configurations have been employed bioretention practices typically consist of an engineered sandy soil media topped with mulch and various plants stormwater runoff entering a bioretention system from the contributing drainage area such as a parking lot roadway or other impervious area slowly infiltrates through the sandy media where pollutants are filtered out adsorbed to soil particles or taken up by plants or microbes prior to exiting the system numerous studies have documented the ability of bioretention practices to mitigate the hydrologic e g davis 2008 debusk and wynn 2011 winston et al 2016 and water quality e g davis 2007 hatt et al 2009 li and davis 2009 brown and hunt 2011 impacts of urban runoff on receiving waterbodies research has also shown that plants play a key role in these processes and enhance the performance of bioretention practices several mesocosm scale studies have characterized the pollutant removal contributions of plants in bioretention practices though the plant types and species that have been investigated are limited many have observed that plants improved removal of nitrogen n and phosphorous p and differences between species and plant types have been reported lucas and greenway 2008 read et al 2008 bratieres et al 2008 plant size species selection and root mass have been found to significantly influence plant contributions and several studies have recommended a variety of grasses including carex appressa shrubs and rushes as preferential selections for bioretention practices read et al 2008 bratieres et al 2008 in one of the few studies investigating the pollutant removal contributions of trees in bioretention practices denman et al 2016 found that the presence of trees significantly improved soluble p and nox removal though significant differences between species and soil types were not consistent and varied seasonally the authors concluded that while trees reduced nox and p relative to unplanted controls species selection did not influence nutrient removal performance denman et al 2016 plants have also been shown to influence the hydrology of bioretention practices through evapotranspiration et several studies have used weighing lysimeters to record et from bioretention practices planted with grasses shrubs and perennials wadzuk et al 2015 found et comprised up to 78 of the water budget of bioretention mesocosms planted with grasses similarly hess et al 2017 used weighing lysimeters in rain gardens planted with switch grass perennials and deciduous shrubs in three media types with varied drainage configurations to conclude that et accounted for between 43 and 70 of water losses scharenbroch et al 2016 found that tree transpiration levels varied between species and accounted for 46 72 of the water balance from a parking lot in illinois outfitted with green infrastructure practices and recommended that species with large mature size and greater total leaf area will likely contribute more toward system hydrologic function while plants have a demonstrated impact on the hydrologic and pollutant removal performance of bioretention practices relatively few studies have investigated the specific role of trees in these systems instead the majority of research on vegetation in bioretention has focused on hardy species of grasses and shrubs which can tolerate the dynamic soil moisture conditions in bioretention practices urban trees provide a number of ecosystem services such as mitigating the heat island effect kurn et al 1994 removing airborne pollutants and improving air quality nowak et al 2006 and influencing urban hydrology through the processes of interception stemflow and throughfall xiao and mcpherson 2016 trees may serve an important role in the ability of bioretention practices to manage stormwater runoff while also impacting urban sustainability by incorporating ancillary environmental and social benefits e g mason et al 2017 further a recent study by tirpak et al 2018a showed that while some tree species are not tolerant to the bioretention environment some trees appear to be well adapted to these conditions however a better understanding of the potential performance differences between various tree species growing in the harsh conditions of the engineered bioretention environment at the individual practice scale is needed to fully recognize their potential role in urban stormwater management and advise engineers and practitioners on the optimal use of trees in future installations to address this need a mesocosm scale study was conducted to examine the hydrologic and pollutant removal contributions of various tree species in bioretention practices semi synthetic stormwater was applied to bioretention columns containing various tree species in a controlled environment to investigate differences in pollutant removal performance over a period of 17 weeks data logging scales were utilized to identify differences in hydrologic impacts between tree species compared to nonvegetated mesocosms the objective of this study was to investigate the role of trees in bioretention practices and identify characteristics related to performance variability findings from this research provide insights to urban foresters stormwater engineers and regulatory agencies on how to integrate trees into bioretention practices and quantify their contributions to urban stormwater management 2 materials and methods twenty bioretention mesocosms were installed in a climate controlled greenhouse in knoxville tennessee usa in the fall of 2016 where mean daily and nightly temperatures were 29 5 c and 24 5 c over the course of the study respectively the mesocosms were constructed using 208l repurposed high density polyethylene barrels each with a diameter of 610 mm and height of approximately 1050 mm this diameter is unique in literature being larger than those utilized in most studies this was intentional as the mesocosms provided additional space for tree growth during the study an important consideration to avoid root restriction issues and unrealistic root soil volume ratios associated with overly small planting containers each mesocosm contained approximately 760 mm of bioretention media consisting of 93 sand 7 clay and 5 organic matter by weight in the form of pine bark mulch topped with a 75 mm layer of shredded hardwood mulch and underlain by a layer of small diameter gravel and washed stone to both prevent media washout and facilitate drainage twelve mesocosms were placed on data logging drum scales which logged measurements every minute at a resolution of 45 g to observe changes in weight due to drainage and evapotranspiration et after watering a diagram of the components of the mesocosms is shown in fig 1 four mesocosm planting treatments were utilized in this study three native us tree species acer rubrum red maple pinus taeda loblolly pine and quercus palustris pin oak and a nonvegetated configuration used as a control throughout the experiment each treatment was replicated five times with three replicates of each placed on scales tree species selections were based on commonly used urban trees in the southeastern u s recommended vegetation in bioretention literature and the tolerance of the species to the wide range of soil moisture conditions typically found in bioretention practices five bare root two year old seedlings of each tree species were randomly planted in the bioretention mesocosms and given approximately seven months to allow for plant establishment during this establishment period the mesocosms were watered with tap water on a weekly basis semi synthetic stormwater applications were conducted over a period of 17 weeks between june and october 2017 the rate and volume of applications were based on 30 years of historic rainfall data for knoxville tennessee usa mean of 80 storm events per year and median rain event of 5 mm historic rainfall data not presented and a simulated drainage area to treatment area ratio of 15 1 based on these parameters each watering session consisted of distributing approximately 18l of semi synthetic stormwater solution to each mesocosm at a frequency of five applications every three weeks i e one week where only one application was performed followed by two consecutive weeks containing two watering events each week pollutant levels typically found in worldwide urban runoff were used as target influent concentrations as presented by bratieres et al 2008 sediment was collected from a local stormwater detention basin dried passed through a 300 μm sieve and added as a source of total suspended solids tss in the semi synthetic stormwater mixture also following methodology from bratieres et al 2008 after determining the contributions from pollutants adsorbed to the sediment as well as baseline levels found in the tap water used to create the semi synthetic stormwater solution various chemicals were added to achieve the desired influent concentrations table 1 the semi synthetic stormwater mixture was continuously mixed in a 750l tank during watering sessions and was distributed in three phases to the mesocosms to ensure uniform dispersion of constituents were maintained in the stormwater applied to each column it should be noted that the nitrogen species in the semi synthetic stormwater mixture were present at higher concentrations than typical stormwater levels and values reported in previous mesocosm studies e g read et al 2008 bratieres et al 2008 this occurred even after reducing the dosing rates of chemical sources of nitrogen amendments to the stormwater mixture indicating these elevated concentrations were likely attributed to nitrogen pollutants adsorbed to the sediment collected from the stormwater detention basin further it is possible that the low po4 3 concentration in the synthetic stormwater limited the detectable p reductions in the mesocosm effluent and that results may vary for other studies investigating different sources and or concentration levels of p in influent runoff weekly samples were collected to monitor the water quality performance of the mesocosms inflow samples were composited by collecting samples directly from the outlet of the mixing tank during watering sessions while outflow samples were taken approximately 24 h after a watering session from containers placed below each column to collect effluent samples were analyzed for tss using usepa method 160 2 usepa 2015 after passing samples through 0 45 μm filters ion chromatography ic was used to determine levels of ammonium nh4 n nitrite and nitrate combined as nox n and phosphate po4 3 while inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes was used for metals analysis copper cu zinc zn lead pb chromium cr manganese mn iron fe nickel ni and cadmium cd in accordance with a combination of standard operating procedures developed by the university of tennessee utk 2007 when constituents in samples were measured below the method detection limit mdl a value of 0 5 mdl was used for statistical analysis table 1 data collected from the scales followed a typical decay curve for soils moving from saturated to field capacity soil moisture conditions zotarelli et al 2009 during this decay distinguishing between drainage and et was not possible as they occurred simultaneously however as drainage ceased the data began to exhibit step changes due to the diurnal patterns in et processes fig 2 weight losses associated with et were identified through these step changes during daytime hours small weight drops occurred as water was removed from the mesocosms as water vapor either through evaporation which increased during the day due to rising temperatures or transpiration which increased throughout the day as the rate of photosynthesis increased these weight drops then reached relative plateaus during nighttime hours as evaporation and transpiration lessened because these daily step changes in mesocosm weight were most readily identified in the data beyond 24 h after a semi synthetic stormwater application i e after drainage verifiably ceased et assessments were conducted during a week long dry period after a watering event on weeks when only one stormwater application was conducted a total of six such instances i e a week long dry period following a watering session occurred during the 17 week study thus six measurements of et for each of the twelve mesocosms on scales were conducted to quantify the weight changes due to et and aid in the identification of the step change behavior in the data the scale readings were smoothed to reduce noise that was present in the raw data this noise was likely associated with the use of climate control equipment in the greenhouse which may have impacted the scale readings due to high power usage a fifth order lowpass butterworth filter was applied to the scale data using matlab beginning at 24 h after the watering event to the end of the week long dry period prior to the next watering session the mathworks 2016 the data were filtered twice i e in the forward and backward direction to eliminate time lag between the raw and filtered data because weight losses due to et could not be separated from drainage losses during daytime hours the time when et became the dominant weight loss process and weight losses due to drainage were no longer occurring was determined when hourly weight changes over a six hour nighttime period beginning between 21 00 and 6 00 were less than 90 g corresponding to twice the resolution of the scales once this et start point was determined the rate of et in mm d 1 was calculated from the weight losses that occurred from the weight at this point to the weight recorded at the end of the week long dry period an example of this analysis is shown in fig 2 transpiration rates of treed columns were then determined by comparing these et rates to those observed in the nonvegetated columns which corresponded solely to evaporation rates effluent concentrations and et rates were compared across the four mesocosm configurations results from shapiro wilk tests for normality indicated that the effluent concentrations were not all normally distributed et rates were normally distributed after removing outliers from the data which were identified as values greater than 1 5 times the interquartile range iqr beyond the upper and lower quantiles and verified based on the drainage behavior of the given mesocosms no outliers were identified in the water quality data comparisons of pollutant removal performance were made using wilcoxon signed rank tests and paired t tests were used to assess differences in mean et rates mm d 1 between the mesocosm configurations statistically significant differences were considered at p 0 05 and p 0 1 when noted and analyses were performed using the statistical software packages jmp pro 13 2 sas institute and r r core team 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of tree species on effluent pollutant concentrations tree species differences had varying degrees of influence on pollutant removal during the study table 2 no significant differences in effluent tss concentrations were observed between red maple loblolly pine pin oak and nonvegetated mesocosms these findings are somewhat expected due to the established success of bioretention media in tss removal it should be noted that all mesocosms would have exceeded minimum performance standards established in the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes general permit for stormwater discharges applicable to the project location knoxville tennessee usa which requires new development sites to attain an 80 reduction in tss from stormwater runoff tdec 2016 similarly no significant differences in effluent nh4 n nox n and po4 3 concentrations were observed between any of the mesocosm configurations however all effluent samples of nh4 n and po4 3 were below analytical detection limits for all configurations which limited the ability to identify any potential differences between the mesocosms for these pollutants the lack of significant differences for both nh4 n and po4 3 are not surprising given the aerobic nature of bioretention media required for nh4 n removal and chemical sorption along with the low influent concentrations present in the synthetic stormwater solution of dissolved p compounds to the bioretention media present in all columns hunt et al 2012 had a higher concentration of po4 3 been used in the synthetic stormwater it would be expected that the mesocosms would maintain similarly high levels of p removal due to the low p index of the media used in the study p index of 11 per the manufacturer as has been reported in previous studies investigating similarly low p index media e g hunt et al 2008 overall these results suggest that uptake via tree roots was not a significant removal pathway of nutrients from the mesocosms this is contradictory to findings from previous studies especially for nitrogen compounds which reported that plants enhanced nitrogen removal in bioretention practices through root uptake i e lucas and greenway 2008 read et al 2008 one possible explanation for this finding is that nitrogen removal via soil microbial processes played a greater role than plant uptake due to the larger mesocosms used in this study 208l read et al 2008 used mesocosms with a volume of roughly 9l which may have allowed plant roots to occupy more of the available soil matrix and consequently increased nitrogen uptake levels compared to the larger mesocosms used in this study lucas and greenway 2008 used similarly large 240l mesocosms in their study and found that while vegetated mesocosms removed more total nitrogen tn than nonvegetated columns tn removal levels exceeded the rate of nitrogen uptake by plants used in the study suggesting denitrification was contributing to nitrogen removal among other influencing factors such as soil properties and species tolerances to nutrient levels plant uptake of nutrients in bioretention practices may vary depending on root structure and distribution within the bioretention media profile and long term monitoring may be needed to determine uptake rates in a natural system total annual n uptake by trees has been estimated at 32 114 kg ha 1 per year but in the short term soil nitrogen pools were found to be highly variable and driven primarily by microbial processes nadelhoffer et al 1984 nitrogen and phosphorous uptake occurs when roots or root associated mycorrhizae directly intercept nutrient deposits in soils as well as via ion movement and water flow through soils along gradients toward roots pallardy 2008 as the trees mature and root systems become more established and occupy a greater volume of the bioretention media plant uptake would be expected to serve a greater role in nitrogen removal from the mesocosms significant differences in effluent concentrations from the mesocosms were observed for some metals loblolly pines had significantly higher effluent ni concentrations than red maple pin oak and nonvegetated mesocosms p 0 05 though no other significant differences for ni removal were observed pin oaks had higher effluent mn concentrations than loblolly pines p 0 05 though this was the only observed difference in mn removal between tree species mesocosms planted with trees had significantly lower mn effluent concentrations than nonvegetated mesocosms p 0 05 though both resulted in a net production of mn this is consistent with findings from read et al 2008 who also reported elevated mn and fe effluent concentrations and attributed them to reduced oxygen levels deeper in the media profile which resulted in mn and to a degree fe precipitation mn is an essential micronutrient for trees and is involved in chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis which may explain why treed mesocosms had lower effluent concentrations than the nonvegetated mesocosms pallardy 2008 no significant differences were observed between any configurations for effluent concentrations of cd cr cu fe pb and zn consistent with previous studies which have linked metals removal to complexation sites in bioretention media which was present in all mesocosms hunt et al 2012 wang et al 2017 finally though metal removal performance varied across the mesocosms to a degree effluent concentrations of metals commonly analyzed in urban stormwater runoff i e cu pb and zn were not significantly different between the four configurations in the study indicating the role of the bioretention media in the removal of these species though few have specifically investigated the contribution of trees the role of vegetation in heavy metals removal in bioretention practices has been investigated in previous studies with varied results muthanna et al 2007 studied water quality performance in a pilot scale bioretention box and found that between 2 and 7 of heavy metal removal could be attributed to the shrubs and flowering species planted in the systems via assimilation into roots and leaves feng et al 2012 found that plants in bioretention columns planted with shrubs grasses sedges and perennials significantly influenced the removal of fe cr and al however cu pb and zn levels were unaffected by the presence of vegetation as was the case in this study read et al 2008 found some variation in metals removal i e mn and zn between a small subset of the plant species studied though effluent metal concentrations from planted trials did not differ from soil only controls similar to findings reported in hatt et al 2007 the ability of plants including trees to contribute to metals removal has also been widely documented in research of phytoremediation efforts pilon smits 2005 many metal species are used by trees as micronutrients and play key roles in metabolic and physiological processes pallardy 2008 however because they are only needed by trees in small concentrations the metals removal provided by the bioretention media may dampen any differences between species as the trees grow it would be expected that the uptake of metals for physiological processes would have a larger effect on the removal of metals in bioretention practices though species differences in contributions to metal removal performance may not be evident until trees have reached a sufficiently mature size overall though some differences in pollutant removal were present between the configurations comparing the results of the mesocosms showed largely consistent performance in removing constituents from the influent semi synthetic stormwater aside from mn which was exported from the mesocosms effluent concentrations from all mesocosms for all pollutants were significantly lower than influent concentrations p 0 01 these results suggest that the bioretention media the only component common to all configurations was critical to pollutant removal via soil based processes over the course of the study this finding illustrates the role of the media in removing dissolved and particle bound constituents from influent runoff and the importance of media composition specifications and testing prior to installation it also highlights the need to understand how much root volume is truly present in field scale bioretention practices and how this changes over time as the role of plants in system performance may be dependent on this attribute such information will help scale results from mesocosm scale studies to full scale field installations 3 2 the role of evapotranspiration in mesocosm hydrology results from the assessment of et rates in the mesocosms are presented in table 3 differences in mean et rates for all treed configurations compared to the nonvegetated mesocosms were significant at p 0 05 aside from pin oak p 0 1 mesocosms planted with red maple trees exhibited significantly higher et rates than all other configurations p 0 05 these results may be connected to the continuous rapid growth of the red maple trees used in the study which resulted in more numerous leaves and a visibly greater total leaf area than the other species by the end of the study however as with other deciduous species et rates in the mesocosms planted with red maple trees would be expected to decline in the fall and winter months as the trees shed their leaves and enter dormancy mean et rates for mesocosms planted with pin oaks and loblolly pines were not significantly different however over time it would be expected that differences in et between the pin oak and loblolly pine trees would become evident due to differences in physiology seasonal impacts on tree function tree growth and increased canopy size compared to the seedlings used in this study with the exception of red maples the et rates observed in the mesocosms were generally lower than values reported in other studies investigating the role of et in bioretention hydrology the mean et rate observed in the mesocosms planted with red maple 3 2 mm d 1 was similar to the mean rate of 3 1 mm d 1 from a freely draining mesocosm planted with native grasses studied by wadzuk et al 2015 though all other configurations fell below this rate mean et rates of all mesocosms were also well below the 6 1 mm d 1 et rate reported by wadzuk et al 2015 from a bioretention mesocosm constructed with an internal water storage iws layer and from et values observed by denich and bradford 2010 who reported average et rates of 4 2 mm d 1 in a bioretention practice during sunny dry weather using lysimeters average et rates from rain garden mesocosms reported by hess et al 2017 were between 2 7 mm d 1 and 4 3 mm d 1 depending on media type and drainage configuration comparable to the rates observed in this study given that the trees used in this study were planted as seedlings the similarities between previously reported et rates in bioretention practices and the rates observed in the mesocosms planted with trees are promising if the trees continued to mature or had larger trees been planted in the mesocosms at the commencement of the study as would likely be the case in field scale installations et rates and water uptake would be expected to increase in a potentially nonlinear fashion due to additional transpirational leaf area and rooting volume for reference the average potential et inside the greenhouse over the study period was estimated to be approximately 5 9 mm d 1 using the thornthwaite equation suggesting the et rates observed in the mesocosms could increase as the plants grow over time however further research on et rates of full scale bioretention practices planted with trees is needed to confirm this hypothesis finally while reporting losses attributed to et represents the total amount of water exiting the system as water vapor isolating the transpiration component from et may provide a more useful insight to stormwater engineers selecting tree species for future bioretention practices measurements of transpiration may be accomplished at the field scale using instruments such as sap flow sensors which until a recent study by tirpak et al 2018b have not been implemented in green infrastructure research 3 3 the role of transpiration in mesocosm hydrology the significant differences between treed and nonvegetated mesocosms highlights the contributions of transpiration to water losses from the systems compared to evaporation alone comparing the mean et rates observed in the treed mesocosms to the nonvegetated mesocosms transpiration rates ranged from a minimum of 0 18 mm d 1 for the pin oaks to a maximum of 1 21 mm d 1 for the red maples accounting for approximately 8 2 37 5 of average daily et losses transpiration is influenced by many plant specific factors including leaf area size shape orientation concentration of stomata on leaf surfaces degree of stomatal control root shoot ratio and tree age and size pallardy 2008 conditions associated with the local microclimate such as temperature precipitation vapor pressure deficit and soil moisture also influence water losses via transpiration further trees grown in bioretention practices may be exposed to several factors specific to the urban environment that may influence growth and function including compacted degraded soils exposure to anthropogenic contaminants limited nutrient and water availability etc and lead to potential deviations in transpiration behavior from natural settings day et al 2010 craul 1985 therefore comparisons between transpiration rates measured in this study to transpiration values reported in forestry literature for these tree species may not adequately account for these differences in growing condition based on findings from guidi et al 2008 the differences in tree level et rates observed between the three species may be explained by the health and growth rate of the trees during the study though plant nutrition was not directly monitored through foliar nutrient testing plant development can be tied to canopy size and stem diameter during the study the red maples produced much larger more densely vegetated crowns from a qualitative observational perspective than the loblolly pines and pin oaks leaf area index and dimensions of the crowns were not directly measured to quantify differences in vegetation however because of the allometric relationship between canopy size and diameter i e increasing canopy size requires similar increases in cross sectional area connected to the development of conducting xylem tissue to meet the water demands associated with increased vegetation comparisons between the diameter of the stems can be made in place of canopy size and dimension pallardy 2008 pretzsch et al 2015 it should be noted that while physiological differences such as xylem anatomy i e ring versus diffuse porous between the species used in this study may influence the rate of water movement through the stem they may not sufficiently explain transpiration differences at the whole tree scale over longer time periods compared to plant development and nutrition pallardy 2008 tree diameters were measured approximately 10 cm above the root collar one week prior to commencing semi synthetic stormwater applications the average diameters for the trees grown in mesocosms installed on the data logging scales were 21 mm 17 mm and 15 mm for the red maple loblolly pine and pin oak trees respectively due to the scope of the study there are not enough replications to assess the level of statistical significance between these diameter measurements however they are in line with qualitative observational differences in canopy size between the species and support the trends in measured et rates in table 3 because the trees were of similar size and age when planted in the mesocosms the diameter measurements in conjunction with relative canopy size and et rates suggest that red maples experienced a greater degree of development and growth relative to the other species during the plant establishment period and throughout the study and highlight the importance of selecting tree species that can tolerate and succeed in the unique growing conditions found in bioretention practices i e prolonged periods of drought followed by intermittent inundation nutrient deficient sandy soils exposure to pollutants present at potentially elevated levels present in urban runoff etc to expand the current understanding of the role that trees may play in bioretention practices further research is needed to analyze the suitability of additional tree species to the bioretention environment and to investigate how physiological differences influence tree performance on a seasonal basis 4 conclusions the hydrologic and pollutant removal performance contributions of trees in bioretention practices were studied by dosing twenty bioretention mesocosms of four vegetated treatments including three native us tree species acer rubrum red maple pinus taeda loblolly pine and quercus palustris pin oak and a nonvegetated control with a semi synthetic stormwater solution over a period of 17 weeks major conclusions from this research include the following comparing the water chemistry of influent stormwater to effluent samples collected from each mesocosm revealed primarily nonsignificant differences between the configurations likely attributable to the relatively small volume of media occupied by the roots of the seedlings used in this study relative to other studies daily evapotranspiration et rates characterized using data logging scales were significantly higher in mesocosms planted with trees compared to nonvegetated mesocosms demonstrating the role of transpiration in bioretention hydrology which accounted for between 8 2 and 37 5 of average daily water losses from the mesocosms the average et rate from mesocosms planted with red maple trees acer rubrum 3 2 mm d 1 was significantly larger than all other configurations and was associated with the degree of plant development canopy size and growth compared to the other species used in the study as with other plants tree species suitability for the bioretention environment should be considered when incorporating trees into bioretention planting plans through careful assessment of tree suitability and species selection stormwater engineers may improve the hydrologic and pollutant removal performance of bioretention practices through the inclusion of trees while increasing the overall environmental impact of these systems by incorporating the various ecosystem services that urban trees provide future research should investigate the performance of larger more mature trees in bioretention practices whose roots would occupy a greater soil volume potentially increasing the role of plant uptake in pollutant removal performance in these systems studies should also examine the impact physiological differences between species have on seasonal transpiration levels and how these variations may influence bioretention performance finally studies should expand upon the number of species used in the study and alter the composition and dosing frequency of the semi synthetic stormwater solution to analyze tree suitability and performance for bioretention practices outside of the southeastern united states or under conditions where higher pollutant concentrations are found declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements funding for this research was provided in part from the us forest service usfs

6277,cities across the world are increasingly utilizing green infrastructure practices as part of their stormwater management programs bioretention areas have become a popular green infrastructure practice due to their widespread success in improving water quality and reducing runoff generated from impervious surfaces several studies have demonstrated that pollutant removal performance can be improved when plants are included in bioretention design however while numerous benefits of trees in urban areas have been identified little knowledge of their contributions to stormwater management in green infrastructure currently exists to address this need a controlled mesocosm experiment was conducted to characterize the degree of stormwater treatment provided by bioretention columns planted with one of three native tree species commonly found across the eastern united states acer rubrum red maple pinus taeda loblolly pine and quercus palustris pin oak tree pollutant removal performance was compared to nonvegetated mesocosms using a semi synthetic stormwater mixture applied to the mesocosms over a period of 17 weeks the hydrologic benefits of each species were characterized using data logging scales placed below the mesocosms to compare evapotranspiration et rates and drainage in each configuration differences in pollutant removal between tree species were largely not significant indicating the dominant role of the bioretention media in mitigating dissolved and particle bound constituents mesocosms planted with red maple acer rubrum had significantly greater average et rates 3 2 mm d 1 than all other configurations attributable to plant development and increased growth and canopy size all mesocosms planted with trees had significantly higher et rates than the nonvegetated mesocosms illustrating the role of transpiration in bioretention hydrology which depending on species accounted for 8 2 37 5 of average daily water losses from the mesocosms during testing these results suggest that trees contribute to bioretention hydrology through evapotranspiration and that significant differences between species exist and are likely related to growth rate keywords bioretention urban trees evapotranspiration stormwater 1 introduction urban stormwater runoff is a significant contributor to impaired water quality and declining aquatic habitats in urban ecosystems throughout the world usepa 1999a stormwater runoff from urban areas which are characterized by concentrated human activity and widespread land use conversion to impervious cover can contain several pollutants introduced through anthropogenic activity such as nutrients metals hydrocarbons bacteria and suspended sediments derived from exposed or compromised urban soils hunt et al 2012 as a result polluted urban stormwater runoff can lead to eutrophication deteriorated riparian zones waterway closures and reduced fishing recreational and aesthetic value of downstream waters hunt et al 2006 increasingly cities and municipalities are implementing green infrastructure stormwater control measures scms and low impact development lid designs into their stormwater management programs because of their versatile design and established performance bioretention practices have become one of the most popular scms implemented to manage urban stormwater runoff in cities worldwide davis et al 2009 bioretention practices rely on both plant and soil processes to remove pollutants from urban stormwater runoff usepa 1999b though many design configurations have been employed bioretention practices typically consist of an engineered sandy soil media topped with mulch and various plants stormwater runoff entering a bioretention system from the contributing drainage area such as a parking lot roadway or other impervious area slowly infiltrates through the sandy media where pollutants are filtered out adsorbed to soil particles or taken up by plants or microbes prior to exiting the system numerous studies have documented the ability of bioretention practices to mitigate the hydrologic e g davis 2008 debusk and wynn 2011 winston et al 2016 and water quality e g davis 2007 hatt et al 2009 li and davis 2009 brown and hunt 2011 impacts of urban runoff on receiving waterbodies research has also shown that plants play a key role in these processes and enhance the performance of bioretention practices several mesocosm scale studies have characterized the pollutant removal contributions of plants in bioretention practices though the plant types and species that have been investigated are limited many have observed that plants improved removal of nitrogen n and phosphorous p and differences between species and plant types have been reported lucas and greenway 2008 read et al 2008 bratieres et al 2008 plant size species selection and root mass have been found to significantly influence plant contributions and several studies have recommended a variety of grasses including carex appressa shrubs and rushes as preferential selections for bioretention practices read et al 2008 bratieres et al 2008 in one of the few studies investigating the pollutant removal contributions of trees in bioretention practices denman et al 2016 found that the presence of trees significantly improved soluble p and nox removal though significant differences between species and soil types were not consistent and varied seasonally the authors concluded that while trees reduced nox and p relative to unplanted controls species selection did not influence nutrient removal performance denman et al 2016 plants have also been shown to influence the hydrology of bioretention practices through evapotranspiration et several studies have used weighing lysimeters to record et from bioretention practices planted with grasses shrubs and perennials wadzuk et al 2015 found et comprised up to 78 of the water budget of bioretention mesocosms planted with grasses similarly hess et al 2017 used weighing lysimeters in rain gardens planted with switch grass perennials and deciduous shrubs in three media types with varied drainage configurations to conclude that et accounted for between 43 and 70 of water losses scharenbroch et al 2016 found that tree transpiration levels varied between species and accounted for 46 72 of the water balance from a parking lot in illinois outfitted with green infrastructure practices and recommended that species with large mature size and greater total leaf area will likely contribute more toward system hydrologic function while plants have a demonstrated impact on the hydrologic and pollutant removal performance of bioretention practices relatively few studies have investigated the specific role of trees in these systems instead the majority of research on vegetation in bioretention has focused on hardy species of grasses and shrubs which can tolerate the dynamic soil moisture conditions in bioretention practices urban trees provide a number of ecosystem services such as mitigating the heat island effect kurn et al 1994 removing airborne pollutants and improving air quality nowak et al 2006 and influencing urban hydrology through the processes of interception stemflow and throughfall xiao and mcpherson 2016 trees may serve an important role in the ability of bioretention practices to manage stormwater runoff while also impacting urban sustainability by incorporating ancillary environmental and social benefits e g mason et al 2017 further a recent study by tirpak et al 2018a showed that while some tree species are not tolerant to the bioretention environment some trees appear to be well adapted to these conditions however a better understanding of the potential performance differences between various tree species growing in the harsh conditions of the engineered bioretention environment at the individual practice scale is needed to fully recognize their potential role in urban stormwater management and advise engineers and practitioners on the optimal use of trees in future installations to address this need a mesocosm scale study was conducted to examine the hydrologic and pollutant removal contributions of various tree species in bioretention practices semi synthetic stormwater was applied to bioretention columns containing various tree species in a controlled environment to investigate differences in pollutant removal performance over a period of 17 weeks data logging scales were utilized to identify differences in hydrologic impacts between tree species compared to nonvegetated mesocosms the objective of this study was to investigate the role of trees in bioretention practices and identify characteristics related to performance variability findings from this research provide insights to urban foresters stormwater engineers and regulatory agencies on how to integrate trees into bioretention practices and quantify their contributions to urban stormwater management 2 materials and methods twenty bioretention mesocosms were installed in a climate controlled greenhouse in knoxville tennessee usa in the fall of 2016 where mean daily and nightly temperatures were 29 5 c and 24 5 c over the course of the study respectively the mesocosms were constructed using 208l repurposed high density polyethylene barrels each with a diameter of 610 mm and height of approximately 1050 mm this diameter is unique in literature being larger than those utilized in most studies this was intentional as the mesocosms provided additional space for tree growth during the study an important consideration to avoid root restriction issues and unrealistic root soil volume ratios associated with overly small planting containers each mesocosm contained approximately 760 mm of bioretention media consisting of 93 sand 7 clay and 5 organic matter by weight in the form of pine bark mulch topped with a 75 mm layer of shredded hardwood mulch and underlain by a layer of small diameter gravel and washed stone to both prevent media washout and facilitate drainage twelve mesocosms were placed on data logging drum scales which logged measurements every minute at a resolution of 45 g to observe changes in weight due to drainage and evapotranspiration et after watering a diagram of the components of the mesocosms is shown in fig 1 four mesocosm planting treatments were utilized in this study three native us tree species acer rubrum red maple pinus taeda loblolly pine and quercus palustris pin oak and a nonvegetated configuration used as a control throughout the experiment each treatment was replicated five times with three replicates of each placed on scales tree species selections were based on commonly used urban trees in the southeastern u s recommended vegetation in bioretention literature and the tolerance of the species to the wide range of soil moisture conditions typically found in bioretention practices five bare root two year old seedlings of each tree species were randomly planted in the bioretention mesocosms and given approximately seven months to allow for plant establishment during this establishment period the mesocosms were watered with tap water on a weekly basis semi synthetic stormwater applications were conducted over a period of 17 weeks between june and october 2017 the rate and volume of applications were based on 30 years of historic rainfall data for knoxville tennessee usa mean of 80 storm events per year and median rain event of 5 mm historic rainfall data not presented and a simulated drainage area to treatment area ratio of 15 1 based on these parameters each watering session consisted of distributing approximately 18l of semi synthetic stormwater solution to each mesocosm at a frequency of five applications every three weeks i e one week where only one application was performed followed by two consecutive weeks containing two watering events each week pollutant levels typically found in worldwide urban runoff were used as target influent concentrations as presented by bratieres et al 2008 sediment was collected from a local stormwater detention basin dried passed through a 300 μm sieve and added as a source of total suspended solids tss in the semi synthetic stormwater mixture also following methodology from bratieres et al 2008 after determining the contributions from pollutants adsorbed to the sediment as well as baseline levels found in the tap water used to create the semi synthetic stormwater solution various chemicals were added to achieve the desired influent concentrations table 1 the semi synthetic stormwater mixture was continuously mixed in a 750l tank during watering sessions and was distributed in three phases to the mesocosms to ensure uniform dispersion of constituents were maintained in the stormwater applied to each column it should be noted that the nitrogen species in the semi synthetic stormwater mixture were present at higher concentrations than typical stormwater levels and values reported in previous mesocosm studies e g read et al 2008 bratieres et al 2008 this occurred even after reducing the dosing rates of chemical sources of nitrogen amendments to the stormwater mixture indicating these elevated concentrations were likely attributed to nitrogen pollutants adsorbed to the sediment collected from the stormwater detention basin further it is possible that the low po4 3 concentration in the synthetic stormwater limited the detectable p reductions in the mesocosm effluent and that results may vary for other studies investigating different sources and or concentration levels of p in influent runoff weekly samples were collected to monitor the water quality performance of the mesocosms inflow samples were composited by collecting samples directly from the outlet of the mixing tank during watering sessions while outflow samples were taken approximately 24 h after a watering session from containers placed below each column to collect effluent samples were analyzed for tss using usepa method 160 2 usepa 2015 after passing samples through 0 45 μm filters ion chromatography ic was used to determine levels of ammonium nh4 n nitrite and nitrate combined as nox n and phosphate po4 3 while inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes was used for metals analysis copper cu zinc zn lead pb chromium cr manganese mn iron fe nickel ni and cadmium cd in accordance with a combination of standard operating procedures developed by the university of tennessee utk 2007 when constituents in samples were measured below the method detection limit mdl a value of 0 5 mdl was used for statistical analysis table 1 data collected from the scales followed a typical decay curve for soils moving from saturated to field capacity soil moisture conditions zotarelli et al 2009 during this decay distinguishing between drainage and et was not possible as they occurred simultaneously however as drainage ceased the data began to exhibit step changes due to the diurnal patterns in et processes fig 2 weight losses associated with et were identified through these step changes during daytime hours small weight drops occurred as water was removed from the mesocosms as water vapor either through evaporation which increased during the day due to rising temperatures or transpiration which increased throughout the day as the rate of photosynthesis increased these weight drops then reached relative plateaus during nighttime hours as evaporation and transpiration lessened because these daily step changes in mesocosm weight were most readily identified in the data beyond 24 h after a semi synthetic stormwater application i e after drainage verifiably ceased et assessments were conducted during a week long dry period after a watering event on weeks when only one stormwater application was conducted a total of six such instances i e a week long dry period following a watering session occurred during the 17 week study thus six measurements of et for each of the twelve mesocosms on scales were conducted to quantify the weight changes due to et and aid in the identification of the step change behavior in the data the scale readings were smoothed to reduce noise that was present in the raw data this noise was likely associated with the use of climate control equipment in the greenhouse which may have impacted the scale readings due to high power usage a fifth order lowpass butterworth filter was applied to the scale data using matlab beginning at 24 h after the watering event to the end of the week long dry period prior to the next watering session the mathworks 2016 the data were filtered twice i e in the forward and backward direction to eliminate time lag between the raw and filtered data because weight losses due to et could not be separated from drainage losses during daytime hours the time when et became the dominant weight loss process and weight losses due to drainage were no longer occurring was determined when hourly weight changes over a six hour nighttime period beginning between 21 00 and 6 00 were less than 90 g corresponding to twice the resolution of the scales once this et start point was determined the rate of et in mm d 1 was calculated from the weight losses that occurred from the weight at this point to the weight recorded at the end of the week long dry period an example of this analysis is shown in fig 2 transpiration rates of treed columns were then determined by comparing these et rates to those observed in the nonvegetated columns which corresponded solely to evaporation rates effluent concentrations and et rates were compared across the four mesocosm configurations results from shapiro wilk tests for normality indicated that the effluent concentrations were not all normally distributed et rates were normally distributed after removing outliers from the data which were identified as values greater than 1 5 times the interquartile range iqr beyond the upper and lower quantiles and verified based on the drainage behavior of the given mesocosms no outliers were identified in the water quality data comparisons of pollutant removal performance were made using wilcoxon signed rank tests and paired t tests were used to assess differences in mean et rates mm d 1 between the mesocosm configurations statistically significant differences were considered at p 0 05 and p 0 1 when noted and analyses were performed using the statistical software packages jmp pro 13 2 sas institute and r r core team 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of tree species on effluent pollutant concentrations tree species differences had varying degrees of influence on pollutant removal during the study table 2 no significant differences in effluent tss concentrations were observed between red maple loblolly pine pin oak and nonvegetated mesocosms these findings are somewhat expected due to the established success of bioretention media in tss removal it should be noted that all mesocosms would have exceeded minimum performance standards established in the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes general permit for stormwater discharges applicable to the project location knoxville tennessee usa which requires new development sites to attain an 80 reduction in tss from stormwater runoff tdec 2016 similarly no significant differences in effluent nh4 n nox n and po4 3 concentrations were observed between any of the mesocosm configurations however all effluent samples of nh4 n and po4 3 were below analytical detection limits for all configurations which limited the ability to identify any potential differences between the mesocosms for these pollutants the lack of significant differences for both nh4 n and po4 3 are not surprising given the aerobic nature of bioretention media required for nh4 n removal and chemical sorption along with the low influent concentrations present in the synthetic stormwater solution of dissolved p compounds to the bioretention media present in all columns hunt et al 2012 had a higher concentration of po4 3 been used in the synthetic stormwater it would be expected that the mesocosms would maintain similarly high levels of p removal due to the low p index of the media used in the study p index of 11 per the manufacturer as has been reported in previous studies investigating similarly low p index media e g hunt et al 2008 overall these results suggest that uptake via tree roots was not a significant removal pathway of nutrients from the mesocosms this is contradictory to findings from previous studies especially for nitrogen compounds which reported that plants enhanced nitrogen removal in bioretention practices through root uptake i e lucas and greenway 2008 read et al 2008 one possible explanation for this finding is that nitrogen removal via soil microbial processes played a greater role than plant uptake due to the larger mesocosms used in this study 208l read et al 2008 used mesocosms with a volume of roughly 9l which may have allowed plant roots to occupy more of the available soil matrix and consequently increased nitrogen uptake levels compared to the larger mesocosms used in this study lucas and greenway 2008 used similarly large 240l mesocosms in their study and found that while vegetated mesocosms removed more total nitrogen tn than nonvegetated columns tn removal levels exceeded the rate of nitrogen uptake by plants used in the study suggesting denitrification was contributing to nitrogen removal among other influencing factors such as soil properties and species tolerances to nutrient levels plant uptake of nutrients in bioretention practices may vary depending on root structure and distribution within the bioretention media profile and long term monitoring may be needed to determine uptake rates in a natural system total annual n uptake by trees has been estimated at 32 114 kg ha 1 per year but in the short term soil nitrogen pools were found to be highly variable and driven primarily by microbial processes nadelhoffer et al 1984 nitrogen and phosphorous uptake occurs when roots or root associated mycorrhizae directly intercept nutrient deposits in soils as well as via ion movement and water flow through soils along gradients toward roots pallardy 2008 as the trees mature and root systems become more established and occupy a greater volume of the bioretention media plant uptake would be expected to serve a greater role in nitrogen removal from the mesocosms significant differences in effluent concentrations from the mesocosms were observed for some metals loblolly pines had significantly higher effluent ni concentrations than red maple pin oak and nonvegetated mesocosms p 0 05 though no other significant differences for ni removal were observed pin oaks had higher effluent mn concentrations than loblolly pines p 0 05 though this was the only observed difference in mn removal between tree species mesocosms planted with trees had significantly lower mn effluent concentrations than nonvegetated mesocosms p 0 05 though both resulted in a net production of mn this is consistent with findings from read et al 2008 who also reported elevated mn and fe effluent concentrations and attributed them to reduced oxygen levels deeper in the media profile which resulted in mn and to a degree fe precipitation mn is an essential micronutrient for trees and is involved in chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis which may explain why treed mesocosms had lower effluent concentrations than the nonvegetated mesocosms pallardy 2008 no significant differences were observed between any configurations for effluent concentrations of cd cr cu fe pb and zn consistent with previous studies which have linked metals removal to complexation sites in bioretention media which was present in all mesocosms hunt et al 2012 wang et al 2017 finally though metal removal performance varied across the mesocosms to a degree effluent concentrations of metals commonly analyzed in urban stormwater runoff i e cu pb and zn were not significantly different between the four configurations in the study indicating the role of the bioretention media in the removal of these species though few have specifically investigated the contribution of trees the role of vegetation in heavy metals removal in bioretention practices has been investigated in previous studies with varied results muthanna et al 2007 studied water quality performance in a pilot scale bioretention box and found that between 2 and 7 of heavy metal removal could be attributed to the shrubs and flowering species planted in the systems via assimilation into roots and leaves feng et al 2012 found that plants in bioretention columns planted with shrubs grasses sedges and perennials significantly influenced the removal of fe cr and al however cu pb and zn levels were unaffected by the presence of vegetation as was the case in this study read et al 2008 found some variation in metals removal i e mn and zn between a small subset of the plant species studied though effluent metal concentrations from planted trials did not differ from soil only controls similar to findings reported in hatt et al 2007 the ability of plants including trees to contribute to metals removal has also been widely documented in research of phytoremediation efforts pilon smits 2005 many metal species are used by trees as micronutrients and play key roles in metabolic and physiological processes pallardy 2008 however because they are only needed by trees in small concentrations the metals removal provided by the bioretention media may dampen any differences between species as the trees grow it would be expected that the uptake of metals for physiological processes would have a larger effect on the removal of metals in bioretention practices though species differences in contributions to metal removal performance may not be evident until trees have reached a sufficiently mature size overall though some differences in pollutant removal were present between the configurations comparing the results of the mesocosms showed largely consistent performance in removing constituents from the influent semi synthetic stormwater aside from mn which was exported from the mesocosms effluent concentrations from all mesocosms for all pollutants were significantly lower than influent concentrations p 0 01 these results suggest that the bioretention media the only component common to all configurations was critical to pollutant removal via soil based processes over the course of the study this finding illustrates the role of the media in removing dissolved and particle bound constituents from influent runoff and the importance of media composition specifications and testing prior to installation it also highlights the need to understand how much root volume is truly present in field scale bioretention practices and how this changes over time as the role of plants in system performance may be dependent on this attribute such information will help scale results from mesocosm scale studies to full scale field installations 3 2 the role of evapotranspiration in mesocosm hydrology results from the assessment of et rates in the mesocosms are presented in table 3 differences in mean et rates for all treed configurations compared to the nonvegetated mesocosms were significant at p 0 05 aside from pin oak p 0 1 mesocosms planted with red maple trees exhibited significantly higher et rates than all other configurations p 0 05 these results may be connected to the continuous rapid growth of the red maple trees used in the study which resulted in more numerous leaves and a visibly greater total leaf area than the other species by the end of the study however as with other deciduous species et rates in the mesocosms planted with red maple trees would be expected to decline in the fall and winter months as the trees shed their leaves and enter dormancy mean et rates for mesocosms planted with pin oaks and loblolly pines were not significantly different however over time it would be expected that differences in et between the pin oak and loblolly pine trees would become evident due to differences in physiology seasonal impacts on tree function tree growth and increased canopy size compared to the seedlings used in this study with the exception of red maples the et rates observed in the mesocosms were generally lower than values reported in other studies investigating the role of et in bioretention hydrology the mean et rate observed in the mesocosms planted with red maple 3 2 mm d 1 was similar to the mean rate of 3 1 mm d 1 from a freely draining mesocosm planted with native grasses studied by wadzuk et al 2015 though all other configurations fell below this rate mean et rates of all mesocosms were also well below the 6 1 mm d 1 et rate reported by wadzuk et al 2015 from a bioretention mesocosm constructed with an internal water storage iws layer and from et values observed by denich and bradford 2010 who reported average et rates of 4 2 mm d 1 in a bioretention practice during sunny dry weather using lysimeters average et rates from rain garden mesocosms reported by hess et al 2017 were between 2 7 mm d 1 and 4 3 mm d 1 depending on media type and drainage configuration comparable to the rates observed in this study given that the trees used in this study were planted as seedlings the similarities between previously reported et rates in bioretention practices and the rates observed in the mesocosms planted with trees are promising if the trees continued to mature or had larger trees been planted in the mesocosms at the commencement of the study as would likely be the case in field scale installations et rates and water uptake would be expected to increase in a potentially nonlinear fashion due to additional transpirational leaf area and rooting volume for reference the average potential et inside the greenhouse over the study period was estimated to be approximately 5 9 mm d 1 using the thornthwaite equation suggesting the et rates observed in the mesocosms could increase as the plants grow over time however further research on et rates of full scale bioretention practices planted with trees is needed to confirm this hypothesis finally while reporting losses attributed to et represents the total amount of water exiting the system as water vapor isolating the transpiration component from et may provide a more useful insight to stormwater engineers selecting tree species for future bioretention practices measurements of transpiration may be accomplished at the field scale using instruments such as sap flow sensors which until a recent study by tirpak et al 2018b have not been implemented in green infrastructure research 3 3 the role of transpiration in mesocosm hydrology the significant differences between treed and nonvegetated mesocosms highlights the contributions of transpiration to water losses from the systems compared to evaporation alone comparing the mean et rates observed in the treed mesocosms to the nonvegetated mesocosms transpiration rates ranged from a minimum of 0 18 mm d 1 for the pin oaks to a maximum of 1 21 mm d 1 for the red maples accounting for approximately 8 2 37 5 of average daily et losses transpiration is influenced by many plant specific factors including leaf area size shape orientation concentration of stomata on leaf surfaces degree of stomatal control root shoot ratio and tree age and size pallardy 2008 conditions associated with the local microclimate such as temperature precipitation vapor pressure deficit and soil moisture also influence water losses via transpiration further trees grown in bioretention practices may be exposed to several factors specific to the urban environment that may influence growth and function including compacted degraded soils exposure to anthropogenic contaminants limited nutrient and water availability etc and lead to potential deviations in transpiration behavior from natural settings day et al 2010 craul 1985 therefore comparisons between transpiration rates measured in this study to transpiration values reported in forestry literature for these tree species may not adequately account for these differences in growing condition based on findings from guidi et al 2008 the differences in tree level et rates observed between the three species may be explained by the health and growth rate of the trees during the study though plant nutrition was not directly monitored through foliar nutrient testing plant development can be tied to canopy size and stem diameter during the study the red maples produced much larger more densely vegetated crowns from a qualitative observational perspective than the loblolly pines and pin oaks leaf area index and dimensions of the crowns were not directly measured to quantify differences in vegetation however because of the allometric relationship between canopy size and diameter i e increasing canopy size requires similar increases in cross sectional area connected to the development of conducting xylem tissue to meet the water demands associated with increased vegetation comparisons between the diameter of the stems can be made in place of canopy size and dimension pallardy 2008 pretzsch et al 2015 it should be noted that while physiological differences such as xylem anatomy i e ring versus diffuse porous between the species used in this study may influence the rate of water movement through the stem they may not sufficiently explain transpiration differences at the whole tree scale over longer time periods compared to plant development and nutrition pallardy 2008 tree diameters were measured approximately 10 cm above the root collar one week prior to commencing semi synthetic stormwater applications the average diameters for the trees grown in mesocosms installed on the data logging scales were 21 mm 17 mm and 15 mm for the red maple loblolly pine and pin oak trees respectively due to the scope of the study there are not enough replications to assess the level of statistical significance between these diameter measurements however they are in line with qualitative observational differences in canopy size between the species and support the trends in measured et rates in table 3 because the trees were of similar size and age when planted in the mesocosms the diameter measurements in conjunction with relative canopy size and et rates suggest that red maples experienced a greater degree of development and growth relative to the other species during the plant establishment period and throughout the study and highlight the importance of selecting tree species that can tolerate and succeed in the unique growing conditions found in bioretention practices i e prolonged periods of drought followed by intermittent inundation nutrient deficient sandy soils exposure to pollutants present at potentially elevated levels present in urban runoff etc to expand the current understanding of the role that trees may play in bioretention practices further research is needed to analyze the suitability of additional tree species to the bioretention environment and to investigate how physiological differences influence tree performance on a seasonal basis 4 conclusions the hydrologic and pollutant removal performance contributions of trees in bioretention practices were studied by dosing twenty bioretention mesocosms of four vegetated treatments including three native us tree species acer rubrum red maple pinus taeda loblolly pine and quercus palustris pin oak and a nonvegetated control with a semi synthetic stormwater solution over a period of 17 weeks major conclusions from this research include the following comparing the water chemistry of influent stormwater to effluent samples collected from each mesocosm revealed primarily nonsignificant differences between the configurations likely attributable to the relatively small volume of media occupied by the roots of the seedlings used in this study relative to other studies daily evapotranspiration et rates characterized using data logging scales were significantly higher in mesocosms planted with trees compared to nonvegetated mesocosms demonstrating the role of transpiration in bioretention hydrology which accounted for between 8 2 and 37 5 of average daily water losses from the mesocosms the average et rate from mesocosms planted with red maple trees acer rubrum 3 2 mm d 1 was significantly larger than all other configurations and was associated with the degree of plant development canopy size and growth compared to the other species used in the study as with other plants tree species suitability for the bioretention environment should be considered when incorporating trees into bioretention planting plans through careful assessment of tree suitability and species selection stormwater engineers may improve the hydrologic and pollutant removal performance of bioretention practices through the inclusion of trees while increasing the overall environmental impact of these systems by incorporating the various ecosystem services that urban trees provide future research should investigate the performance of larger more mature trees in bioretention practices whose roots would occupy a greater soil volume potentially increasing the role of plant uptake in pollutant removal performance in these systems studies should also examine the impact physiological differences between species have on seasonal transpiration levels and how these variations may influence bioretention performance finally studies should expand upon the number of species used in the study and alter the composition and dosing frequency of the semi synthetic stormwater solution to analyze tree suitability and performance for bioretention practices outside of the southeastern united states or under conditions where higher pollutant concentrations are found declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements funding for this research was provided in part from the us forest service usfs

6278,a large part of total solid flux is transported as suspension in mountainous rivers it is crucial for water resource management and for environmental issues to be able to model and to understand these fluxes however suspended load is known to be highly variable in time and space as fine sediments can originate from various erosion processes and from various sources among the different methodologies available for analyzing the suspended sediment flux dynamics hysteretic loops in discharge and suspended load signals are commonly used to assess sediment sources and production processes however the shape of these loops is often analyzed qualitatively for a single or a small number of catchments hence it is still unclear how the geomorphological catchment properties influence the variability of the flow rate suspended sediment concentration relationship through the hysteresis effects this is particularly true in mountainous catchments where important sources of fine sediments may originate from the river bed in addition to hillslopes in this study we analyzed quantitatively ten long term series of high frequency observations of suspended sediment load measured in contrasted alpine catchments hysteresis effects were analyzed in a high number of automated sampled events and the dominant response for each catchment was sought this was done by using a normalized hysteresis index developed by lloyd et al 2016 which we weighted by the mass transported during each event the various catchments were characterized with a normalized geomorphological index expressing the relative importance of sediment sources originating from the river bed or from eroded areas as a function of the distance to the outlet of the catchment the dominant hysteresis response of the ten alpine catchments studied was found to be greatly linked to their geomorphological index these results suggest that the sediment source configuration upstream of a measuring station drives hysteresis effects and thus the variability of the flow rate suspended sediment concentration relationship keywords suspended load hysteresis sediment sources alpine catchments 1 introduction suspended sediment load ssl assessment is essential for water resource management and for many environmental issues whereas fine sediments transported by rivers are a vector of nutrients that are essential for estuarine ecosystems le pape et al 2013 ludwig and probst 1998 they are also associated with socio economic issues due to reservoir siltation or contaminant transport vercruysse et al 2017 walling et al 2003 ssl is known to be highly variable in time and space especially in mountainous areas given that fine sediments can originate either from the main fluvial system or from external sources in similar proportions guillon et al 2018 navratil et al 2010 orwin and smart 2004 according to the concept proposed by bogen 1980 and the conceptual models used by picouet et al 2009 or park and hunt 2017 the first type of production consists of sediment resuspension from the river bed this part of suspension is believed to be related to flow rate shear stress or stream power park and hunt 2017 in this case fine sediments are produced by resuspension of deposited fine particles on bars in secondary channels when the armor layer is mobilized navratil et al 2010 or when bank erosion occurs lefrançois et al 2007 the second type concerns erosion processes that take place in the catchment and that may not be directly related to the flow rate measured in the main channel fine particles are produced by rainfall or runoff detachment on eroded areas in first order tributaries or by mass movement the coexistence of these two kinds of fine sediment production processes often generates a huge variability in the flow rate q suspended sediment concentration ssc relationship as observed in many field studies at the event inter event or seasonal time scale the same flow solicitation does not lead to the same sediment response of the watershed aich et al 2014 andermann et al 2012 mao and carrillo 2016 sun et al 2016 this non unique relation between q and ssc is often highlighted through hysteresis loop observations these phenomena have been widely analyzed in the past few decades and in various environments aguilera and melack 2018 baca 2010 bogen 1980 gharari and razavi 2018 klein 1984 smith and dragovich 2009 tananaev 2015 zuecco et al 2016 the first classification of hysteresis loops was proposed by williams 1989 five classes were distinguished single valued line clockwise loops counterclockwise loops single line plus a loop and figure of eight loop this classification was then re used and completed with more complex figures by various authors such as nistor and church 2005 tananaev 2015 duvert et al 2010 or hamshaw et al 2018 in a literature review gellis 2013 highlights that a given hysteresis effect observed at a measuring station can be explained by various erosion and physical processes however at the event scale distant sediment sources were found to generate mainly counterclockwise loops baca 2010 klein 1984 williams 1989 suspended sediments are transported more or less at the mean flow velocity which is lower than the flood wave celerity this means that if the travelling distance and the relative difference between the celerity of the two waves is high enough a time delay will be observed between the two signals generating a counterclockwise loop klein 1984 nistor and church 2005 williams 1989 by contrast depletion in the ssc during the falling limb of the flood or an ssc peak prior to a q peak will generate a clockwise loop this is usually attributed to a mobilization of relatively close and supply limited sources marttila and kløve 2010 park and hunt 2017 dilution due to base flow increase during the falling limb baca 2010 or rainfall close to the catchment outlet jansson 2002 many other processes could generate hysteresis between ssc and q such as the contribution of upstream tributaries asselman 1999 bank erosion smith and dragovich 2009 or hysteresis effects in the ssc turbidity calibration curve landers and sturm 2013 in some cases the ssc and q curve are synchronized leading to no hysteresis pattern such situations were often interpreted as an unlimited sediment supply nistor and church 2005 williams 1989 finally complex patterns can be observed for multi peak events or when several processes described previously occur at the same time in the catchment given the high number of processes leading to q ssc hysteresis it is doubtful to infer even qualitatively the major erosion processes acting in a unique catchment with this single information especially when measurements are conducted for short time periods esteves et al 2019 on the other hand using measurements made on several contrasted watersheds at regional scale could help to assess to which extent the sediment sources configuration may control the shape of these hysteresis and thus to better understand the spatial variability in the q ssc relation during the last decades there has been a growing interest in sediment sources characterization parsons et al 2015 wohl 2017 as sediment contributing areas have been shown to control sediment yield in alpine catchments de vente et al 2006 haas et al 2011 despite the respective contribution of each sediment sources are often highly variable in time and space legout et al 2013 several methods have been proposed to quantify sediment connectivity in catchments borselli et al 2008 heckmann et al 2018 heckmann and schwanghart 2013 most of these methods conceptually consider an upslope contributing area and a downslope source to sink component to spatially describe the capacity of the catchment to export sediments borselli et al 2008 cavalli et al 2013 heckmann and schwanghart 2013 while this separation in two components in connectivity indexes i e upslope and downslope is similar to the conceptual distinction in two sediment sources hillslope vs riverbed production often depicted as the main controlling factor of discharge suspended sediment concentration hysteresis no study reported any attempt to quantify the potential links between hysteresis and conceptual description of sediment sources this study attempts to fill this gap by analyzing long term series with high frequency observations of ssl made in ten contrasted mountainous catchments in the french alps the main objectives were i to describe the dominant hysteresis patterns ii to propose a method describing fine sediment source configuration at the catchment scale and iii to analyze the link between dominant hysteresis patterns and sediment source configuration 2 material and methods 2 1 hydro geomorphological characteristics of the catchments four of the ten catchments studied asse bléone galabre and bès are located in the southern part of the french alps and four others romanche arvan glandon and arc are in the northern part fig 1 two basins drac and buëch have intermediate positions the ten catchments belong to the long term observatory networks of two french research infrastructures ozcar and rza or from the monitoring network of electricité de france company edf 2 1 1 spatial information used data were collected for several characteristics of the basins table 1 monthly average specific discharges were obtained from the french hydrometric agency banque hydro http www hydro eaufrance fr whereas spatial catchment properties were obtained thanks to a gis analysis of several spatial databases bd ortho bd alti corine land cover geofla ign active channel widths were digitalized manually on aerial orthophotographies and the fluvial corridor tool box roux et al 2015 was used in arcgis 10 3 to extract the active channel width at a regular step of 20 m the median active river bed width calculated over the first 10 km upstream the station w10 the mean riverbed slope was obtained from the french national institute of geography website https geodesie ign fr fiches for approximately 10 km upstream of each measuring station s10 a georeferenced dataset of polygonal features with the location of eroded areas in the alps https journals openedition org rga 3543 tocto2n6 was used for the bléone asse bès galabre buëch drac and romanche catchments bertrand 2014 bertrand et al 2017 these areas can be easily recognized in alpine catchments on high resolution orthophotos and manually digitized using classic gis toolkits or using automatic extraction procedure as it have been done in several previous studies marden et al 2005 trustrum and stephens 1981 vrieling 2006 bertrand et al 2017 obtained the eroded patches map used in this study by combining object based supervised classification models on infrared aerial orthophotographies 831 tiles 0 5 m resolution and a pixel based supervised classification model on landsat 7 etm images three images with 30 m resolution and offering a wider spectral range than aerial orthophotographies to extract eroded areas in the southern part of the alps the training and validation datasets used are each constituted of 30 infrared aerial orthophotographies tiles randomly sampled in the 831 tiles automatically segmented into objects having homogeneous textures and manually classified into two categories eroded areas and non eroded areas the final classification model is a weighted sum of these calibrated models both object based and pixel based they obtained a model sensitivity specificity and overall classification score of respectively 0 81 0 94 and 0 9 they also performed an expert classification on 500 randomly distributed points in the bléone catchment and obtained similar results 0 74 0 99 and 0 96 respectively confirming the reliability of this method for the glandon arvan and arc basins this map was not available and eroded areas were digitalized manually using 50 cm resolution aerial orthophotographies in both cases eroded patches are considered through the image analysis as exposed and unvegetated areas exhibiting erosion patterns or gullies this eroded areas description is consistent with the fact that increasing bare soils cover increases suspended sediment yield douglas 1967 duvert et al 2012 2 1 2 hydrological regimes table 1 shows the contrasting characteristics of the ten catchments their areas range from 22 km2 to nearly 900 km2 the hydrology of the catchments located in the southern alps including the buëch basin exhibits a high flow period in winter and late autumn separated by a low flow period in summer fig 2 the northern catchments have higher specific water discharges they are characterized by the presence of snow cover and glaciers resulting in a melting season generating high flows from late spring to mid summer and low flow periods the rest of the time the drac catchment exhibits an intermediate discharge regime with a melting season in late spring followed by low flow period in summer and another high flow period in autumn due to widespread rainfall events the northern catchments are higher in altitude 61 of mean area above 2000 m than southern ones 98 of mean area under 2000 m with the drac exhibiting an intermediate situation 35 of catchment area above 2000 m 2 1 3 geomorphological characteristics various land cover and lithologies are present on these catchments northern catchments including the drac basin have large areas prone to erosion with zones having no or low vegetation cover ranging from 24 to 51 of their total area and rocks considered as non resistant covering between 57 and 99 of their area the arvan glandon and romanche catchments comprise mainly narrow mountain valleys with laterally constrained streams few alluvial reaches are included in the dominant step pool sections with mean river bed slopes on the first 10 km upstream the station s10 comprised between 4 and 5 9 and median river bed active widths on the first 10 km upstream the station w10 ranging between 8 m and 22 m having a larger catchment area the arc has a gentler river bed slope s10 1 12 and a wider river bed active width w10 33 m it exhibits mainly plan bed sections with few gavel bars downstream active tributaries punctuated with narrow gorge sections the drac basin has poorly laterally constrained streams in its downstream part and a gentle slope s10 1 01 enabling the development of braiding sections on dozen of kilometers w10 60 m southern catchments including the buëch basin are also prone to erosion with a fraction of their basin that has low or no vegetation cover ranging between 10 and 19 and non resistant rocks cover ranging between 79 and 100 their valleys are wider than the northern catchments except for the galabre catchment which is a small headwater stream a 22 km2 with constrained gorges and step pool sections w10 8 m s10 8 8 the bléone and buëch exhibit braiding morphologies w10 of respectively 162 m and 118 m with gentle slopes s10 of respectively 0 82 and 0 81 the asse and bès catchments also exhibit long alluvial and gentle sections which are punctuated with narrower sections in gorges or more constrained valleys w10 of respectively 28 m and 20 m s10 of respectively 0 87 and 2 57 mano et al 2009 reported specific suspended sediment fluxes around 500 t km 2 year 1 for the asse bléone and romanche catchment while navratil et al 2012 reported specific suspended sediment fluxes of respectively 330 690 and 680 t km 2 year 1 for the bléone bès and galabre basins which can be classified as high according to the classification proposed by meybec et al 2003 these studies suggest that the studied catchments have highly active fine sediment sources also all of these catchments have been chosen for their limited human impact i e with limited presence of embankments or weirs in the rivers limited urbanized areas and absence of large dams few small water intakes with limited storage capacity are however present glandon arvan drac romanche and arc basins but can be considered to have a negligible effect on the downstream suspended load transfer during the studied flood events 2 2 suspended load time series the available ssl time series range from 3 to 10 years table 1 for each catchment the water discharges q were calculated from automated measurements of the water levels with a frequency of 1 h stage discharge rating curves were obtained thanks to numerous technics acoustic doppler current profiler salt dilution current meters or large scale particle image velocimetry techniques regularly performed during the study period the surrogate technique for ssc estimation i e turbidity meter coupled with direct sampling of ssc for calibration was used as commonly done for such field monitoring mano et al 2009 navratil et al 2011 ssc was assumed to be uniform over the cross section owing to the high levels of turbulence in these rivers generating well mixed flows ssl was computed by multiplying ssc and q at a 1 h frequency 2 3 hysteresis analysis tools in order to determine the dominant hysteresis pattern for the ten alpine catchments a database of runoff events was created individual events were selected considering both ssl and ssc in a first step the events having a maximum ssl below a given threshold were not considered a ssl threshold value ssl1 was used corresponding to the value below which 1 of the cumulated suspended sediment fluxes were transported fig 3 a similar approach was adopted to remove events exhibiting ssc values below a threshold corresponding to 1 of the cumulated suspended sediment fluxes ssc1 the normalized index hilloyd proposed by lloyd et al 2016 was used eq 3 this non dimensional index is non sensitive to the absolute value of ssc and q which makes it possible to do inter event and inter catchment comparison of hysteresis strength and direction this index tends towards 1 for clockwise loops and towards 1 for counterclockwise loops to compute hilloyd for a given event ssc and q were normalized using their minimum and maximum values eqs 1 and 2 to obtain ssc and q the differences between ssc monitored during the rising and the falling limb were then computed for each of the 100 values of q ranging between 0 01 and 1 fig 4 finally hilloyd corresponds to the mean of these differences eq 3 1 ssc i ssc i ssc min ssc max ssc min 2 q i q i q min q max q min 3 hi lloyd m e a n ssc i rising q i ssc i falling q i i 0 01 1 for each catchment and each selected events a hilloyd value was calculated the median value was considered representative of the dominant hysteresis patterns m e d i a n h i lloyd however the most frequent hysteresis patterns might not necessarily be those that transport most of the fine sediments thus a new index hi ms was introduced to investigate the transport efficiency associated to hysteresis this was achieved by weighting each event by the transported mass m s i 4 hi ms hi lloyd i ms i ms i whereas several hilloyd index are calculated one for each event only one hlms index is calculated for the series of events and inform which hilloyd index is associated with the maximum transport these two continuous indexes were completed with classic pattern classifications gellis 2013 williams 1989 hysteresis patterns were arbitrarily considered as clockwise when at least 80 of positive differences were observed between ssc during the rising and falling limb n b cl counterclockwise loops were considered when at least 80 of negative differences were obtained n b ccl otherwise the flood was considered to have a complex hysteresis patterns or no hysteresis n b complex finally the percentages of the mass transported as clockwise hysteresis m s cl as counterclockwise hysteresis m s ccl and as complex or no hysteresis m s complex were calculated for each catchment this classification permits a direct comparison between the number of events having a certain shape and the mass exported within this shape 2 4 sediment sources characterization an analysis of each catchment was performed following the conceptual sediment sources description river bed vs hillslopes proposed by bogen 1980 and often considered for qualitative hysteresis interpretations at the catchment scale buendia et al 2016 guillon et al 2018 mao and carrillo 2016 smith and dragovich 2009 according to connectivity concepts developed by borselli et al 2008 and cavalli et al 2013 the area of eroded patches and the traveling distance needed to reach the outlet from these zones are important factors controlling the catchment connectivity also according to numerous studies on fine sediments storage in the river network the river width and the rived bed area are parameters that have a strong control on the quantity of fine particles that can be stored in the river bed collins and walling 2007 lambert and walling 1988 navratil et al 2010 piqué et al 2014 these latter parameters may also be good proxies of the buffering capacity of the river bed and of its influence on fine sediments connectivity indeed the exchanging surface between the flow and the river bed may have important control on fine particles infiltration in the gravel matrix frostick et al 1984 mooneyham and strom 2018 following these evidences a simplified sediment sources characterization was developed the surface occupied by the active river channel width was considered as the first type of sediment source whereas eroded areas were considered as the second type fig 5 the erosion maps described in section 2 1 were used for eroded areas identification the distance needed by the water to reach the measuring station for each of these eroded area was estimated by using a digital elevation model with 25 m horizontal resolution and various algorithms of the spatial analyst toolbox of arcgis 10 3 fill flowlength and flowdirection this water path from eroded areas to the outlet of the basin was calculated by considering the maximum slope for each grid of the digital elevation model for a given location in the watershed and considering the total area between this point and the measuring station downstream we defined the cumulative eroded area as the sum of the eroded patches area a eroded cum and the cumulative area of the river bed as the sum of the active channel area a bed cum which was extracted using the active channel width digitalization these two cumulative areas as well as their ratio a eroded cum a bed cum were calculated for each distance x from the monitoring station with an incremental spatial step of 20 m from downstream to upstream for each catchment the most upstream point was arbitrarily defined by a drainage area threshold of 1 km2 this point was located at a flow distance l from the outlet finally the sources configuration index s c i x was defined as the mean of the ratios a eroded cum a bed cum calculated for the first x percent of the distance l 5 sci x m e a n a eroded c u m i a bed c u m i i 0 x this geomorphological index gives information on the relative importance of each type of sediment source depending on the distance from the measuring station it is a simplified description developed to test the reliability of usual qualitative interpretation made for hysteresis patterns hillslopes vs river bed the slope is not explicitly taken into account even if it is often negatively correlated with the active river width likewise local weighting factors roughness or land use in borselli et al 2008 and cavalli et al 2013 that could better describe the capacity to produce transfer or store fine sediments were not considered as they were difficult to estimate a posteriori and more questionable for suspended load than for bedload or debris flow processes this simple index permits to compare different spatial sources configuration fig 6 for instance simplified conceptual cases a and b could probably lead to different hysteresis patterns at the outlet of the basin even if they have similar total cumulated bed and eroded area at the catchment scale in case a eroded areas are located in the upper part of the basin whereas large storage zones of the river bed are located in the downstream part close to the monitoring station case b has the same bed configuration but eroded areas are located much closer to the outlet of the catchment d 1 d 2 in that case the ratio a eroded c u m a bed c u m increases much closer to the outlet than in case a calculating the mean value of this ratio on a given distance permits to discriminate between these two cases they have the same a eroded c u m a bed c u m ratio considering the total length x 100 but the mean of these ratios calculated for x between 0 and 100 sci 100 average of the red curve in fig 6 is much lower in case a than in case b comparing conceptual cases a and c highlights the capacity of the index to compare different buffering effect played by the river bed these cases have similar eroded areas located at the same distance from outlet d 1 but the cumulative bed area is much lower in case c eroded areas could be less buffered in case c than in case a the mean value of the a eroded c u m a bed c u m ratio calculated for x between 0 and 100 sci 100 will be smaller in case a than in case c in order to discriminate the relative influence of hillslope sources and river bed on the hysteresis variability an eroded area index eai x and a bed area index bai x were also defined and calculated for the ten catchments eqs 6 and 7 6 eai x mean a eroded c u m i m a x a eroded c u m i 0 x 7 bai x mean a bed c u m i m a x a bed c u m i 0 x 3 results 3 1 runoff event characteristics following the event selection procedure see fig 3 the thresholds for ssl and ssc were calculated and a dataset of events was created for each river table 2 more events were selected for northern catchments exhibiting daily floods during the melting season while the observation periods were similar for the glandon and the asse there were twice more selected events for the glandon large differences were also observed in ssl1 and ssc1 values e g the galabre and the bès rivers have suspended fluxes transported for higher values of ssc in comparison with other rivers 3 2 variability of discharge concentration hysteresis in alpine catchments while the standard deviations of the hilloyd were rather high for all catchments some consistent observations can be made on the basis of the median hilloyd table3 fig 7 most rivers exhibited median values of hilloyd around zero because this value was often the most frequent and also because high positive or negative values had similar frequencies this suggests an absence of a dominant hysteresis trend clockwise or counterclockwise in terms of the frequency of events having a certain shape however mainly clockwise loops median hilloyd 0 were observed for the buech drac and bléone catchments that have dominant braided bed morphology close to the monitoring stations suggesting a more frequent contribution of the river bed sediment sources than in other catchments different conclusions can be drawn when comparing the hlms index most transporting with the median most frequent hilloyd index for each catchment table 3 and fig 7 in northern catchments median hilloyd and h i m s values were similar maximum index difference of 0 02 however in the soutern catchments larger differences were observed between the two hysteresis indexes with differences median hilloyd minus h i m s ranging between 0 13 and 0 16 thus the most frequent hysteresis shape was often not the most transport efficient one for instance 23 of events were classified as clockwise in the asse and they contribute to 58 of the total ssl while 31 of events were classified as counterclockwise and contribute to only 11 of the total ssl this suggests a higher transport efficiency of clockwise hysteresis patterns than counterclockwise ones 3 3 sediment sources analysis large differences in the relative location of river bed and eroded area sediment sources were observed between catchments as shown in fig 8 b the arvan exhibited large eroded areas close to the measuring station with a limited bed area leading to a ratio of a erodedcum a bedcum equal to one at a distance of roughly 7 km by contrast for the bléone the bed area is larger than the eroded areas in the first 50 km close to the monitoring station fig 8a the cumulative eroded areas exceeded the cumulative bed areas only after 55 km to quantitatively compare these differences between the ten basins we plot in fig 9 a eroded cum x m a x a eroded cum the fraction of the total cumulative eroded area as a function of the distance from the outlet a bed cum x m a x a bed cum the fraction of the total cumulative bed area as a function of the distance from the outlet sci x the average values of the ratios a eroded cum a bed cum calculated on a given distance upstream the outlet 0 to x for the ten catchments the cumulative bed area exhibited a relative constant increase with increasing distance to the outlet fig 9a this suggests that bed areas were as a first approximation homogeneously distributed along the x distance in comparison the cumulative eroded area showed a more sudden increase with the increasing distance to the outlet fig 9b a small fraction of eroded area was located close to the monitoring stations as less than 50 of eroded areas are located for x distance smaller than 0 5 and less than 10 for x smaller than 0 2 also much more variability between the ten catchments was observed for instance the normalized cumulative eroded area of the romanche basin starts to increase significantly for x around 0 5 while the bléone basin showed a sudden increase for x larger than 0 8 this suggests that eroded areas were located more in the upstream part of the bléone watershed than for the romanche some catchments as the arc basin exhibited a more smooth increase indicating a more homogeneous eroded patches distribution along the x distance finally the source configuration index sci x eq 5 shows for all rivers an increase in the relative importance of eroded areas as compared with bed areas when moving in the upstream direction fig 9c this confirms that river bed sources were closer to the measuring station than eroded areas sources however some small eroded tributaries could locally generate a high value of sci x near the observation station as was the case for the galabre river sci x were highly variable from one catchment to another the shortest distance considered x 10 to compute this index led to small differences between catchments whereas longer distances led to large differences for instance the two extreme cases the bléone and arvan rivers had the same sci 10 0 1 but their sci 100 values were very different 0 3 and 21 3 respectively the sources indexes sci x bai x eai x values calculated for x ranging from 10 to 100 with a x step of 10 are provided as supplementary material for more details 3 4 relation between sediment sources configuration and dominant hysteresis patterns the general catchment characteristics the index describing the river bed area distribution bai x the index describing the eroded area distribution eai x and the index comparing river bed and eroded area distribution sci x were compared with the dominant hysteresis pattern for each catchment table 4 while some significant correlations were found between general catchment characteristics and hysteresis indexes the values remained rather low and did not exceed 0 63 overall the lloyd hysteresis index hiloyd exhibited only limited and small significant correlations with the three sediment sources indexes sci x bai x eai x in comparison with the mass weighted hysteresis index hims significant negative correlations ρ 0 98 pvalue 0 01 were found between hims and the sediment sources index sci x fig 10 and table 4 this result suggests that the part of the fluxes exported with clockwise loops decreases when the relative importance of the eroded areas relative to the bed areas increases lower but also significant negative correlations ρ 0 71 pvalue 0 01 were obtained between the mass weighted hysteresis index hims and the eroded area distribution index eai x while no significant correlations were obtained between hims and the bed area distribution index bai x it indicates that the spatial distribution of eroded areas in the catchment is an important factor for explaining the hysteresis variability while river bed area distribution alone cannot explain this variability however using both information i e bed area distribution combined with eroded area distribution sci x permits a much better explanation of the hysteresis variability between catchments than considering eroded area distribution alone the correlation between the mass weighted hysteresis index hims and the sediment source configuration index sci x in a lesser extent with eroded area distribution index eai x was found to increase when averaging the values over increasing distance x from the outlet both explanatory variables reached their maximum correlation value at a distance upstream of the monitoring station of approximately 70 table 4 and fig 10 the closest source configuration indexes were not found to explain the variability of hysteresis patterns between catchments suggesting that close source configurations alone cannot explain the suspended load dynamics 4 discussion 4 1 dominant hysteresis patterns and transport efficiency hysteresis effects are usually analyzed by counting the number of events having a certain shape aguilera and melack 2018 aich et al 2014 buendia et al 2016 hamshaw et al 2018 navratil et al 2010 however the comparison done in this study of ten contrasted alpine catchments highlighted that different results can be obtained by considering the fluxes transported with a given shape fig 7 from these results two recommendations can be made depending on the objective of the study for those aiming at identifying the dominant sediment production processes for a given catchment the hysteresis analysis should necessarily consider the intensity of each event i e the average mass weighted hysteresis index for studies aiming at understanding more in detail the hydro sedimentary catchment functioning both in terms of occurrence and efficiency of the events transporting fine sediments the analysis of hysteresis should be done simultaneously for both indexes in our case no relation was found between the median value of the lloyd hysteresis index hilloyd considering the number of events and any sediment source index sci x eai x bai x while significant correlations were found with the average mass weighted index this suggests that the transport efficiency of hysteresis loops should be considered as a proxy of sediment production processes calculating the two indices also allowed us to observe distinct behaviors for the ten alpine catchments the differences between the fluxes exported and the frequency of events having a certain hysteresis shape were much higher for the southern catchments including the buëch river than for the northern ones fig 7 this could be due to differences in hydrological regimes fig 2 indeed the southern catchments exhibited a more pronounced seasonal variability of the hysteresis values than the northern ones fig 11 counterclockwise patterns were mainly observed during summer corresponding to dry periods associated to short and intense convective storms clockwise patterns were observed during wet periods characterized by low intensity but rather long precipitation events leading to larger rainfall amounts than during summer these results were consistent with those from navratil et al 2012 reporting that clockwise hysteresis loops exported the bulk of total suspended load during widespread flood events in the bléone catchment they observed marked counterclockwise loops during summer rainstorms in upper tributaries which generate suspended fluxes that were not efficiently transferred downstream this might explain why large differences were observed between the frequency and the fluxes exported with a given hysteresis for these southern basins similar trends were observed by soler et al 2008 or buendia et al 2016 in pyrenean catchments having similar hydrological regimes in comparison the northern catchments exhibited a much more constant export of fine sediments during the frequent daily flood events of the melting season many more flood events were observed for similar monitoring periods in the north than in the south table 2 mano et al 2009 reported that 90 of the suspended fluxes were transported in 5 and 7 of the time for the bléone and asse rivers respectively while 25 of the time was needed for the romanche river 4 2 influence of catchment geomorphological characteristics the relation between the mass weighted hysteresis and catchment sources configuration river bed vs eroded areas is consistent with previous findings and typical qualitative analyses of the hysteresis patterns which considers that a counterclockwise loops indicates a distant contribution while a clockwise loop results from a relatively close source mobilization bogen 1980 gellis 2013 guillon et al 2018 mao and carrillo 2016 navratil et al 2012 2010 smith and dragovich 2009 influence of watershed characteristics on ssl hysteresis patterns was observed by aguilera and melack 2018 in ten mountainous californian catchments also using a random forest model on 45 measuring stations vaughan et al 2017 showed that considering near channel morphological characteristics in addition to land use contributes to a better explanation of the sediment rating curve parameters than using land use only their random forest model explained 38 and 43 of the hysteresis variance when considering respectively only watershed metrics or watershed plus near channel metrics in our analysis we also observed that both sources need to be considered however our results show the importance to consider not only global catchments properties but the relative importance of these two types of sources bed vs eroded areas as well as their travelling distance to the monitoring station to explain hysteresis variability between catchments also as was observed by vaughan et al 2017 we should stress that including the bed area information by considering the relative spatial distribution of eroded versus bed area sci x and not the spatial distribution of eroded area eai x alone permits a much better explanation of the hysteresis variability and thus of the suspended load dynamics this result is also consistent with several studies that reported a significant buffering effect played by the river bed which could be considered as a significant fine sediment source in mountainous catchments having relatively large and active alluvial reaches guillon et al 2018 navratil et al 2012 2010 orwin and smart 2004 the results obtained in this paper and in previous studies bring us to propose the following conceptual description of hysteresis and sediment configuration interactions fig 12 the dominant hysteresis effect observed at a given location in a catchment could depend on the upstream capacity to produce distant erosion and to buffer these upstream fluxes if the remobilization of fine sediments from the river bed did not exist mainly counterclockwise hysteresis should have been observed because of celerity differences between the flow rate and ssc waves klein 1984 thus the hysteresis patterns would depend on the location of the observation point for a given geomorphological scale point a b c or d in fig 12 following the conceptual configuration in fig 12 the fraction of ssl coming from the river bed and driven by the total flow rate could increase when moving to the downstream part of a catchment while ssl coming directly from primary hillslope sources and driven by rainfall or runoff could decrease such scale dependencies of hysteresis processes have been already noticed in hydrological studies gharari and razavi 2018 for instance davies and beven 2015 have shown by using a synthetic case that hysteresis between streamflow and catchment storage was changing with the catchment size considered 4 3 limitations and implications given the wide range of characteristics of the 10 studied alpine catchments comprising various sizes geologies altitudes hydrological and sedimentary regimes the proposed approach can be considered as relevant in other mountainous environments however its relevance should be tested in other contexts such as low land agricultural or arid environments the analysis of the sediment sources might be improved to get a more detailed description of the catchment sources configuration to investigate its relation with suspended load at shorter spatial and temporal scales for instance the mechanical properties of rocks in eroded areas could be taken into account to give more importance to soft rocks than to more resistant ones for catchments with contrasted lithologies the local river bed slope could also be explicitly considered in addition to the active river width to get a proxy of the buffering capacity of the bed this would probably give less importance to steep streams and more importance to gentle ones these potential improvements might be tested in future work however while the approach used does not represent all the complexity of interactions between suspended load and sediment source configuration a significant part of the variability of ssl hysteresis can be explained by this simplified source description at a regional scale this confirms the strong link between hysteresis processes and the variable sediment sources activation that have been qualitatively described for decades gellis 2013 gharari and razavi 2018 williams 1989 our results suggest that even for small catchments fine sediment dynamics and hysteresis effects could be largely influenced by erosion and deposition processes occurring in the river bed this might be the case in catchments where eroded areas are located far enough upstream so that the main channel can act as a buffering reservoir of fine sediments however larger catchments with well developed fluvial systems could conversely be influenced in a non negligible way by hillslope process production if some eroded areas are located at a short distance from the monitoring station both processes are probably inevitably linked the fractions of ssl coming from the bed or from the hillslopes seem to change depending on the point considered in the catchment the simple sediment sources analysis proposed in this study could be performed prior to the installation of a gauging station or prior to modeling effort in order to assess which kind of processes should be considered in a conceptual modeling approach it could also be helpful to determine the dominant fine sediment production process for river or dam management at the catchment scale 5 conclusions this study aimed at testing the links between discharge suspended sediment concentrations q ssc hysteresis and the spatial configuration of sediment sources which have been qualitatively considered for decades without been quantitatively tested a quantitative analysis of sediment sources configuration and q ssc hysteresis was performed in ten contrasted alpine catchments hysteresis indexes were calculated on a high number of automated sampled events to extract the dominant hysteresis pattern for each catchment simple indexes were developed to describe the river bed and eroded patches area distribution as well as a travelling distance to the outlet the main findings can be summarized as follows i considering the dominant ssl hysteresis in a given catchment as the most frequent pattern or as the most efficient in terms of transport can lead to different results our observations suggest that the transport efficiency of hysteresis should be considered to infer the dominant sediment production process this could be particularly true for catchments having most of their fluxes exported during few short events and exhibiting marked seasonal hysteresis variability thus an averaged mass weighted hysteresis index was proposed ii a strong correlation was found between mass weighted hysteresis index and sediment sources configuration index river bed vs eroded area which confirms the qualitative interpretations often made for ssc q hysteresis processes we also observed that the sources configuration should be considered on a long enough fraction of the catchment at least 50 of the whole principal river network upstream the observation point to explain the spatial hysteresis variability this is consistent with the rather long travelled distances of suspended particles iii in comparison to previous studies these results show the importance to consider not only general catchment properties or sediment sources to understand ssl dynamics but their spatial distribution and connectivity furthermore including bed related information increases significantly the explanatory power of the ssc q hysteresis variability than using only primary hillslope sources

6278,a large part of total solid flux is transported as suspension in mountainous rivers it is crucial for water resource management and for environmental issues to be able to model and to understand these fluxes however suspended load is known to be highly variable in time and space as fine sediments can originate from various erosion processes and from various sources among the different methodologies available for analyzing the suspended sediment flux dynamics hysteretic loops in discharge and suspended load signals are commonly used to assess sediment sources and production processes however the shape of these loops is often analyzed qualitatively for a single or a small number of catchments hence it is still unclear how the geomorphological catchment properties influence the variability of the flow rate suspended sediment concentration relationship through the hysteresis effects this is particularly true in mountainous catchments where important sources of fine sediments may originate from the river bed in addition to hillslopes in this study we analyzed quantitatively ten long term series of high frequency observations of suspended sediment load measured in contrasted alpine catchments hysteresis effects were analyzed in a high number of automated sampled events and the dominant response for each catchment was sought this was done by using a normalized hysteresis index developed by lloyd et al 2016 which we weighted by the mass transported during each event the various catchments were characterized with a normalized geomorphological index expressing the relative importance of sediment sources originating from the river bed or from eroded areas as a function of the distance to the outlet of the catchment the dominant hysteresis response of the ten alpine catchments studied was found to be greatly linked to their geomorphological index these results suggest that the sediment source configuration upstream of a measuring station drives hysteresis effects and thus the variability of the flow rate suspended sediment concentration relationship keywords suspended load hysteresis sediment sources alpine catchments 1 introduction suspended sediment load ssl assessment is essential for water resource management and for many environmental issues whereas fine sediments transported by rivers are a vector of nutrients that are essential for estuarine ecosystems le pape et al 2013 ludwig and probst 1998 they are also associated with socio economic issues due to reservoir siltation or contaminant transport vercruysse et al 2017 walling et al 2003 ssl is known to be highly variable in time and space especially in mountainous areas given that fine sediments can originate either from the main fluvial system or from external sources in similar proportions guillon et al 2018 navratil et al 2010 orwin and smart 2004 according to the concept proposed by bogen 1980 and the conceptual models used by picouet et al 2009 or park and hunt 2017 the first type of production consists of sediment resuspension from the river bed this part of suspension is believed to be related to flow rate shear stress or stream power park and hunt 2017 in this case fine sediments are produced by resuspension of deposited fine particles on bars in secondary channels when the armor layer is mobilized navratil et al 2010 or when bank erosion occurs lefrançois et al 2007 the second type concerns erosion processes that take place in the catchment and that may not be directly related to the flow rate measured in the main channel fine particles are produced by rainfall or runoff detachment on eroded areas in first order tributaries or by mass movement the coexistence of these two kinds of fine sediment production processes often generates a huge variability in the flow rate q suspended sediment concentration ssc relationship as observed in many field studies at the event inter event or seasonal time scale the same flow solicitation does not lead to the same sediment response of the watershed aich et al 2014 andermann et al 2012 mao and carrillo 2016 sun et al 2016 this non unique relation between q and ssc is often highlighted through hysteresis loop observations these phenomena have been widely analyzed in the past few decades and in various environments aguilera and melack 2018 baca 2010 bogen 1980 gharari and razavi 2018 klein 1984 smith and dragovich 2009 tananaev 2015 zuecco et al 2016 the first classification of hysteresis loops was proposed by williams 1989 five classes were distinguished single valued line clockwise loops counterclockwise loops single line plus a loop and figure of eight loop this classification was then re used and completed with more complex figures by various authors such as nistor and church 2005 tananaev 2015 duvert et al 2010 or hamshaw et al 2018 in a literature review gellis 2013 highlights that a given hysteresis effect observed at a measuring station can be explained by various erosion and physical processes however at the event scale distant sediment sources were found to generate mainly counterclockwise loops baca 2010 klein 1984 williams 1989 suspended sediments are transported more or less at the mean flow velocity which is lower than the flood wave celerity this means that if the travelling distance and the relative difference between the celerity of the two waves is high enough a time delay will be observed between the two signals generating a counterclockwise loop klein 1984 nistor and church 2005 williams 1989 by contrast depletion in the ssc during the falling limb of the flood or an ssc peak prior to a q peak will generate a clockwise loop this is usually attributed to a mobilization of relatively close and supply limited sources marttila and kløve 2010 park and hunt 2017 dilution due to base flow increase during the falling limb baca 2010 or rainfall close to the catchment outlet jansson 2002 many other processes could generate hysteresis between ssc and q such as the contribution of upstream tributaries asselman 1999 bank erosion smith and dragovich 2009 or hysteresis effects in the ssc turbidity calibration curve landers and sturm 2013 in some cases the ssc and q curve are synchronized leading to no hysteresis pattern such situations were often interpreted as an unlimited sediment supply nistor and church 2005 williams 1989 finally complex patterns can be observed for multi peak events or when several processes described previously occur at the same time in the catchment given the high number of processes leading to q ssc hysteresis it is doubtful to infer even qualitatively the major erosion processes acting in a unique catchment with this single information especially when measurements are conducted for short time periods esteves et al 2019 on the other hand using measurements made on several contrasted watersheds at regional scale could help to assess to which extent the sediment sources configuration may control the shape of these hysteresis and thus to better understand the spatial variability in the q ssc relation during the last decades there has been a growing interest in sediment sources characterization parsons et al 2015 wohl 2017 as sediment contributing areas have been shown to control sediment yield in alpine catchments de vente et al 2006 haas et al 2011 despite the respective contribution of each sediment sources are often highly variable in time and space legout et al 2013 several methods have been proposed to quantify sediment connectivity in catchments borselli et al 2008 heckmann et al 2018 heckmann and schwanghart 2013 most of these methods conceptually consider an upslope contributing area and a downslope source to sink component to spatially describe the capacity of the catchment to export sediments borselli et al 2008 cavalli et al 2013 heckmann and schwanghart 2013 while this separation in two components in connectivity indexes i e upslope and downslope is similar to the conceptual distinction in two sediment sources hillslope vs riverbed production often depicted as the main controlling factor of discharge suspended sediment concentration hysteresis no study reported any attempt to quantify the potential links between hysteresis and conceptual description of sediment sources this study attempts to fill this gap by analyzing long term series with high frequency observations of ssl made in ten contrasted mountainous catchments in the french alps the main objectives were i to describe the dominant hysteresis patterns ii to propose a method describing fine sediment source configuration at the catchment scale and iii to analyze the link between dominant hysteresis patterns and sediment source configuration 2 material and methods 2 1 hydro geomorphological characteristics of the catchments four of the ten catchments studied asse bléone galabre and bès are located in the southern part of the french alps and four others romanche arvan glandon and arc are in the northern part fig 1 two basins drac and buëch have intermediate positions the ten catchments belong to the long term observatory networks of two french research infrastructures ozcar and rza or from the monitoring network of electricité de france company edf 2 1 1 spatial information used data were collected for several characteristics of the basins table 1 monthly average specific discharges were obtained from the french hydrometric agency banque hydro http www hydro eaufrance fr whereas spatial catchment properties were obtained thanks to a gis analysis of several spatial databases bd ortho bd alti corine land cover geofla ign active channel widths were digitalized manually on aerial orthophotographies and the fluvial corridor tool box roux et al 2015 was used in arcgis 10 3 to extract the active channel width at a regular step of 20 m the median active river bed width calculated over the first 10 km upstream the station w10 the mean riverbed slope was obtained from the french national institute of geography website https geodesie ign fr fiches for approximately 10 km upstream of each measuring station s10 a georeferenced dataset of polygonal features with the location of eroded areas in the alps https journals openedition org rga 3543 tocto2n6 was used for the bléone asse bès galabre buëch drac and romanche catchments bertrand 2014 bertrand et al 2017 these areas can be easily recognized in alpine catchments on high resolution orthophotos and manually digitized using classic gis toolkits or using automatic extraction procedure as it have been done in several previous studies marden et al 2005 trustrum and stephens 1981 vrieling 2006 bertrand et al 2017 obtained the eroded patches map used in this study by combining object based supervised classification models on infrared aerial orthophotographies 831 tiles 0 5 m resolution and a pixel based supervised classification model on landsat 7 etm images three images with 30 m resolution and offering a wider spectral range than aerial orthophotographies to extract eroded areas in the southern part of the alps the training and validation datasets used are each constituted of 30 infrared aerial orthophotographies tiles randomly sampled in the 831 tiles automatically segmented into objects having homogeneous textures and manually classified into two categories eroded areas and non eroded areas the final classification model is a weighted sum of these calibrated models both object based and pixel based they obtained a model sensitivity specificity and overall classification score of respectively 0 81 0 94 and 0 9 they also performed an expert classification on 500 randomly distributed points in the bléone catchment and obtained similar results 0 74 0 99 and 0 96 respectively confirming the reliability of this method for the glandon arvan and arc basins this map was not available and eroded areas were digitalized manually using 50 cm resolution aerial orthophotographies in both cases eroded patches are considered through the image analysis as exposed and unvegetated areas exhibiting erosion patterns or gullies this eroded areas description is consistent with the fact that increasing bare soils cover increases suspended sediment yield douglas 1967 duvert et al 2012 2 1 2 hydrological regimes table 1 shows the contrasting characteristics of the ten catchments their areas range from 22 km2 to nearly 900 km2 the hydrology of the catchments located in the southern alps including the buëch basin exhibits a high flow period in winter and late autumn separated by a low flow period in summer fig 2 the northern catchments have higher specific water discharges they are characterized by the presence of snow cover and glaciers resulting in a melting season generating high flows from late spring to mid summer and low flow periods the rest of the time the drac catchment exhibits an intermediate discharge regime with a melting season in late spring followed by low flow period in summer and another high flow period in autumn due to widespread rainfall events the northern catchments are higher in altitude 61 of mean area above 2000 m than southern ones 98 of mean area under 2000 m with the drac exhibiting an intermediate situation 35 of catchment area above 2000 m 2 1 3 geomorphological characteristics various land cover and lithologies are present on these catchments northern catchments including the drac basin have large areas prone to erosion with zones having no or low vegetation cover ranging from 24 to 51 of their total area and rocks considered as non resistant covering between 57 and 99 of their area the arvan glandon and romanche catchments comprise mainly narrow mountain valleys with laterally constrained streams few alluvial reaches are included in the dominant step pool sections with mean river bed slopes on the first 10 km upstream the station s10 comprised between 4 and 5 9 and median river bed active widths on the first 10 km upstream the station w10 ranging between 8 m and 22 m having a larger catchment area the arc has a gentler river bed slope s10 1 12 and a wider river bed active width w10 33 m it exhibits mainly plan bed sections with few gavel bars downstream active tributaries punctuated with narrow gorge sections the drac basin has poorly laterally constrained streams in its downstream part and a gentle slope s10 1 01 enabling the development of braiding sections on dozen of kilometers w10 60 m southern catchments including the buëch basin are also prone to erosion with a fraction of their basin that has low or no vegetation cover ranging between 10 and 19 and non resistant rocks cover ranging between 79 and 100 their valleys are wider than the northern catchments except for the galabre catchment which is a small headwater stream a 22 km2 with constrained gorges and step pool sections w10 8 m s10 8 8 the bléone and buëch exhibit braiding morphologies w10 of respectively 162 m and 118 m with gentle slopes s10 of respectively 0 82 and 0 81 the asse and bès catchments also exhibit long alluvial and gentle sections which are punctuated with narrower sections in gorges or more constrained valleys w10 of respectively 28 m and 20 m s10 of respectively 0 87 and 2 57 mano et al 2009 reported specific suspended sediment fluxes around 500 t km 2 year 1 for the asse bléone and romanche catchment while navratil et al 2012 reported specific suspended sediment fluxes of respectively 330 690 and 680 t km 2 year 1 for the bléone bès and galabre basins which can be classified as high according to the classification proposed by meybec et al 2003 these studies suggest that the studied catchments have highly active fine sediment sources also all of these catchments have been chosen for their limited human impact i e with limited presence of embankments or weirs in the rivers limited urbanized areas and absence of large dams few small water intakes with limited storage capacity are however present glandon arvan drac romanche and arc basins but can be considered to have a negligible effect on the downstream suspended load transfer during the studied flood events 2 2 suspended load time series the available ssl time series range from 3 to 10 years table 1 for each catchment the water discharges q were calculated from automated measurements of the water levels with a frequency of 1 h stage discharge rating curves were obtained thanks to numerous technics acoustic doppler current profiler salt dilution current meters or large scale particle image velocimetry techniques regularly performed during the study period the surrogate technique for ssc estimation i e turbidity meter coupled with direct sampling of ssc for calibration was used as commonly done for such field monitoring mano et al 2009 navratil et al 2011 ssc was assumed to be uniform over the cross section owing to the high levels of turbulence in these rivers generating well mixed flows ssl was computed by multiplying ssc and q at a 1 h frequency 2 3 hysteresis analysis tools in order to determine the dominant hysteresis pattern for the ten alpine catchments a database of runoff events was created individual events were selected considering both ssl and ssc in a first step the events having a maximum ssl below a given threshold were not considered a ssl threshold value ssl1 was used corresponding to the value below which 1 of the cumulated suspended sediment fluxes were transported fig 3 a similar approach was adopted to remove events exhibiting ssc values below a threshold corresponding to 1 of the cumulated suspended sediment fluxes ssc1 the normalized index hilloyd proposed by lloyd et al 2016 was used eq 3 this non dimensional index is non sensitive to the absolute value of ssc and q which makes it possible to do inter event and inter catchment comparison of hysteresis strength and direction this index tends towards 1 for clockwise loops and towards 1 for counterclockwise loops to compute hilloyd for a given event ssc and q were normalized using their minimum and maximum values eqs 1 and 2 to obtain ssc and q the differences between ssc monitored during the rising and the falling limb were then computed for each of the 100 values of q ranging between 0 01 and 1 fig 4 finally hilloyd corresponds to the mean of these differences eq 3 1 ssc i ssc i ssc min ssc max ssc min 2 q i q i q min q max q min 3 hi lloyd m e a n ssc i rising q i ssc i falling q i i 0 01 1 for each catchment and each selected events a hilloyd value was calculated the median value was considered representative of the dominant hysteresis patterns m e d i a n h i lloyd however the most frequent hysteresis patterns might not necessarily be those that transport most of the fine sediments thus a new index hi ms was introduced to investigate the transport efficiency associated to hysteresis this was achieved by weighting each event by the transported mass m s i 4 hi ms hi lloyd i ms i ms i whereas several hilloyd index are calculated one for each event only one hlms index is calculated for the series of events and inform which hilloyd index is associated with the maximum transport these two continuous indexes were completed with classic pattern classifications gellis 2013 williams 1989 hysteresis patterns were arbitrarily considered as clockwise when at least 80 of positive differences were observed between ssc during the rising and falling limb n b cl counterclockwise loops were considered when at least 80 of negative differences were obtained n b ccl otherwise the flood was considered to have a complex hysteresis patterns or no hysteresis n b complex finally the percentages of the mass transported as clockwise hysteresis m s cl as counterclockwise hysteresis m s ccl and as complex or no hysteresis m s complex were calculated for each catchment this classification permits a direct comparison between the number of events having a certain shape and the mass exported within this shape 2 4 sediment sources characterization an analysis of each catchment was performed following the conceptual sediment sources description river bed vs hillslopes proposed by bogen 1980 and often considered for qualitative hysteresis interpretations at the catchment scale buendia et al 2016 guillon et al 2018 mao and carrillo 2016 smith and dragovich 2009 according to connectivity concepts developed by borselli et al 2008 and cavalli et al 2013 the area of eroded patches and the traveling distance needed to reach the outlet from these zones are important factors controlling the catchment connectivity also according to numerous studies on fine sediments storage in the river network the river width and the rived bed area are parameters that have a strong control on the quantity of fine particles that can be stored in the river bed collins and walling 2007 lambert and walling 1988 navratil et al 2010 piqué et al 2014 these latter parameters may also be good proxies of the buffering capacity of the river bed and of its influence on fine sediments connectivity indeed the exchanging surface between the flow and the river bed may have important control on fine particles infiltration in the gravel matrix frostick et al 1984 mooneyham and strom 2018 following these evidences a simplified sediment sources characterization was developed the surface occupied by the active river channel width was considered as the first type of sediment source whereas eroded areas were considered as the second type fig 5 the erosion maps described in section 2 1 were used for eroded areas identification the distance needed by the water to reach the measuring station for each of these eroded area was estimated by using a digital elevation model with 25 m horizontal resolution and various algorithms of the spatial analyst toolbox of arcgis 10 3 fill flowlength and flowdirection this water path from eroded areas to the outlet of the basin was calculated by considering the maximum slope for each grid of the digital elevation model for a given location in the watershed and considering the total area between this point and the measuring station downstream we defined the cumulative eroded area as the sum of the eroded patches area a eroded cum and the cumulative area of the river bed as the sum of the active channel area a bed cum which was extracted using the active channel width digitalization these two cumulative areas as well as their ratio a eroded cum a bed cum were calculated for each distance x from the monitoring station with an incremental spatial step of 20 m from downstream to upstream for each catchment the most upstream point was arbitrarily defined by a drainage area threshold of 1 km2 this point was located at a flow distance l from the outlet finally the sources configuration index s c i x was defined as the mean of the ratios a eroded cum a bed cum calculated for the first x percent of the distance l 5 sci x m e a n a eroded c u m i a bed c u m i i 0 x this geomorphological index gives information on the relative importance of each type of sediment source depending on the distance from the measuring station it is a simplified description developed to test the reliability of usual qualitative interpretation made for hysteresis patterns hillslopes vs river bed the slope is not explicitly taken into account even if it is often negatively correlated with the active river width likewise local weighting factors roughness or land use in borselli et al 2008 and cavalli et al 2013 that could better describe the capacity to produce transfer or store fine sediments were not considered as they were difficult to estimate a posteriori and more questionable for suspended load than for bedload or debris flow processes this simple index permits to compare different spatial sources configuration fig 6 for instance simplified conceptual cases a and b could probably lead to different hysteresis patterns at the outlet of the basin even if they have similar total cumulated bed and eroded area at the catchment scale in case a eroded areas are located in the upper part of the basin whereas large storage zones of the river bed are located in the downstream part close to the monitoring station case b has the same bed configuration but eroded areas are located much closer to the outlet of the catchment d 1 d 2 in that case the ratio a eroded c u m a bed c u m increases much closer to the outlet than in case a calculating the mean value of this ratio on a given distance permits to discriminate between these two cases they have the same a eroded c u m a bed c u m ratio considering the total length x 100 but the mean of these ratios calculated for x between 0 and 100 sci 100 average of the red curve in fig 6 is much lower in case a than in case b comparing conceptual cases a and c highlights the capacity of the index to compare different buffering effect played by the river bed these cases have similar eroded areas located at the same distance from outlet d 1 but the cumulative bed area is much lower in case c eroded areas could be less buffered in case c than in case a the mean value of the a eroded c u m a bed c u m ratio calculated for x between 0 and 100 sci 100 will be smaller in case a than in case c in order to discriminate the relative influence of hillslope sources and river bed on the hysteresis variability an eroded area index eai x and a bed area index bai x were also defined and calculated for the ten catchments eqs 6 and 7 6 eai x mean a eroded c u m i m a x a eroded c u m i 0 x 7 bai x mean a bed c u m i m a x a bed c u m i 0 x 3 results 3 1 runoff event characteristics following the event selection procedure see fig 3 the thresholds for ssl and ssc were calculated and a dataset of events was created for each river table 2 more events were selected for northern catchments exhibiting daily floods during the melting season while the observation periods were similar for the glandon and the asse there were twice more selected events for the glandon large differences were also observed in ssl1 and ssc1 values e g the galabre and the bès rivers have suspended fluxes transported for higher values of ssc in comparison with other rivers 3 2 variability of discharge concentration hysteresis in alpine catchments while the standard deviations of the hilloyd were rather high for all catchments some consistent observations can be made on the basis of the median hilloyd table3 fig 7 most rivers exhibited median values of hilloyd around zero because this value was often the most frequent and also because high positive or negative values had similar frequencies this suggests an absence of a dominant hysteresis trend clockwise or counterclockwise in terms of the frequency of events having a certain shape however mainly clockwise loops median hilloyd 0 were observed for the buech drac and bléone catchments that have dominant braided bed morphology close to the monitoring stations suggesting a more frequent contribution of the river bed sediment sources than in other catchments different conclusions can be drawn when comparing the hlms index most transporting with the median most frequent hilloyd index for each catchment table 3 and fig 7 in northern catchments median hilloyd and h i m s values were similar maximum index difference of 0 02 however in the soutern catchments larger differences were observed between the two hysteresis indexes with differences median hilloyd minus h i m s ranging between 0 13 and 0 16 thus the most frequent hysteresis shape was often not the most transport efficient one for instance 23 of events were classified as clockwise in the asse and they contribute to 58 of the total ssl while 31 of events were classified as counterclockwise and contribute to only 11 of the total ssl this suggests a higher transport efficiency of clockwise hysteresis patterns than counterclockwise ones 3 3 sediment sources analysis large differences in the relative location of river bed and eroded area sediment sources were observed between catchments as shown in fig 8 b the arvan exhibited large eroded areas close to the measuring station with a limited bed area leading to a ratio of a erodedcum a bedcum equal to one at a distance of roughly 7 km by contrast for the bléone the bed area is larger than the eroded areas in the first 50 km close to the monitoring station fig 8a the cumulative eroded areas exceeded the cumulative bed areas only after 55 km to quantitatively compare these differences between the ten basins we plot in fig 9 a eroded cum x m a x a eroded cum the fraction of the total cumulative eroded area as a function of the distance from the outlet a bed cum x m a x a bed cum the fraction of the total cumulative bed area as a function of the distance from the outlet sci x the average values of the ratios a eroded cum a bed cum calculated on a given distance upstream the outlet 0 to x for the ten catchments the cumulative bed area exhibited a relative constant increase with increasing distance to the outlet fig 9a this suggests that bed areas were as a first approximation homogeneously distributed along the x distance in comparison the cumulative eroded area showed a more sudden increase with the increasing distance to the outlet fig 9b a small fraction of eroded area was located close to the monitoring stations as less than 50 of eroded areas are located for x distance smaller than 0 5 and less than 10 for x smaller than 0 2 also much more variability between the ten catchments was observed for instance the normalized cumulative eroded area of the romanche basin starts to increase significantly for x around 0 5 while the bléone basin showed a sudden increase for x larger than 0 8 this suggests that eroded areas were located more in the upstream part of the bléone watershed than for the romanche some catchments as the arc basin exhibited a more smooth increase indicating a more homogeneous eroded patches distribution along the x distance finally the source configuration index sci x eq 5 shows for all rivers an increase in the relative importance of eroded areas as compared with bed areas when moving in the upstream direction fig 9c this confirms that river bed sources were closer to the measuring station than eroded areas sources however some small eroded tributaries could locally generate a high value of sci x near the observation station as was the case for the galabre river sci x were highly variable from one catchment to another the shortest distance considered x 10 to compute this index led to small differences between catchments whereas longer distances led to large differences for instance the two extreme cases the bléone and arvan rivers had the same sci 10 0 1 but their sci 100 values were very different 0 3 and 21 3 respectively the sources indexes sci x bai x eai x values calculated for x ranging from 10 to 100 with a x step of 10 are provided as supplementary material for more details 3 4 relation between sediment sources configuration and dominant hysteresis patterns the general catchment characteristics the index describing the river bed area distribution bai x the index describing the eroded area distribution eai x and the index comparing river bed and eroded area distribution sci x were compared with the dominant hysteresis pattern for each catchment table 4 while some significant correlations were found between general catchment characteristics and hysteresis indexes the values remained rather low and did not exceed 0 63 overall the lloyd hysteresis index hiloyd exhibited only limited and small significant correlations with the three sediment sources indexes sci x bai x eai x in comparison with the mass weighted hysteresis index hims significant negative correlations ρ 0 98 pvalue 0 01 were found between hims and the sediment sources index sci x fig 10 and table 4 this result suggests that the part of the fluxes exported with clockwise loops decreases when the relative importance of the eroded areas relative to the bed areas increases lower but also significant negative correlations ρ 0 71 pvalue 0 01 were obtained between the mass weighted hysteresis index hims and the eroded area distribution index eai x while no significant correlations were obtained between hims and the bed area distribution index bai x it indicates that the spatial distribution of eroded areas in the catchment is an important factor for explaining the hysteresis variability while river bed area distribution alone cannot explain this variability however using both information i e bed area distribution combined with eroded area distribution sci x permits a much better explanation of the hysteresis variability between catchments than considering eroded area distribution alone the correlation between the mass weighted hysteresis index hims and the sediment source configuration index sci x in a lesser extent with eroded area distribution index eai x was found to increase when averaging the values over increasing distance x from the outlet both explanatory variables reached their maximum correlation value at a distance upstream of the monitoring station of approximately 70 table 4 and fig 10 the closest source configuration indexes were not found to explain the variability of hysteresis patterns between catchments suggesting that close source configurations alone cannot explain the suspended load dynamics 4 discussion 4 1 dominant hysteresis patterns and transport efficiency hysteresis effects are usually analyzed by counting the number of events having a certain shape aguilera and melack 2018 aich et al 2014 buendia et al 2016 hamshaw et al 2018 navratil et al 2010 however the comparison done in this study of ten contrasted alpine catchments highlighted that different results can be obtained by considering the fluxes transported with a given shape fig 7 from these results two recommendations can be made depending on the objective of the study for those aiming at identifying the dominant sediment production processes for a given catchment the hysteresis analysis should necessarily consider the intensity of each event i e the average mass weighted hysteresis index for studies aiming at understanding more in detail the hydro sedimentary catchment functioning both in terms of occurrence and efficiency of the events transporting fine sediments the analysis of hysteresis should be done simultaneously for both indexes in our case no relation was found between the median value of the lloyd hysteresis index hilloyd considering the number of events and any sediment source index sci x eai x bai x while significant correlations were found with the average mass weighted index this suggests that the transport efficiency of hysteresis loops should be considered as a proxy of sediment production processes calculating the two indices also allowed us to observe distinct behaviors for the ten alpine catchments the differences between the fluxes exported and the frequency of events having a certain hysteresis shape were much higher for the southern catchments including the buëch river than for the northern ones fig 7 this could be due to differences in hydrological regimes fig 2 indeed the southern catchments exhibited a more pronounced seasonal variability of the hysteresis values than the northern ones fig 11 counterclockwise patterns were mainly observed during summer corresponding to dry periods associated to short and intense convective storms clockwise patterns were observed during wet periods characterized by low intensity but rather long precipitation events leading to larger rainfall amounts than during summer these results were consistent with those from navratil et al 2012 reporting that clockwise hysteresis loops exported the bulk of total suspended load during widespread flood events in the bléone catchment they observed marked counterclockwise loops during summer rainstorms in upper tributaries which generate suspended fluxes that were not efficiently transferred downstream this might explain why large differences were observed between the frequency and the fluxes exported with a given hysteresis for these southern basins similar trends were observed by soler et al 2008 or buendia et al 2016 in pyrenean catchments having similar hydrological regimes in comparison the northern catchments exhibited a much more constant export of fine sediments during the frequent daily flood events of the melting season many more flood events were observed for similar monitoring periods in the north than in the south table 2 mano et al 2009 reported that 90 of the suspended fluxes were transported in 5 and 7 of the time for the bléone and asse rivers respectively while 25 of the time was needed for the romanche river 4 2 influence of catchment geomorphological characteristics the relation between the mass weighted hysteresis and catchment sources configuration river bed vs eroded areas is consistent with previous findings and typical qualitative analyses of the hysteresis patterns which considers that a counterclockwise loops indicates a distant contribution while a clockwise loop results from a relatively close source mobilization bogen 1980 gellis 2013 guillon et al 2018 mao and carrillo 2016 navratil et al 2012 2010 smith and dragovich 2009 influence of watershed characteristics on ssl hysteresis patterns was observed by aguilera and melack 2018 in ten mountainous californian catchments also using a random forest model on 45 measuring stations vaughan et al 2017 showed that considering near channel morphological characteristics in addition to land use contributes to a better explanation of the sediment rating curve parameters than using land use only their random forest model explained 38 and 43 of the hysteresis variance when considering respectively only watershed metrics or watershed plus near channel metrics in our analysis we also observed that both sources need to be considered however our results show the importance to consider not only global catchments properties but the relative importance of these two types of sources bed vs eroded areas as well as their travelling distance to the monitoring station to explain hysteresis variability between catchments also as was observed by vaughan et al 2017 we should stress that including the bed area information by considering the relative spatial distribution of eroded versus bed area sci x and not the spatial distribution of eroded area eai x alone permits a much better explanation of the hysteresis variability and thus of the suspended load dynamics this result is also consistent with several studies that reported a significant buffering effect played by the river bed which could be considered as a significant fine sediment source in mountainous catchments having relatively large and active alluvial reaches guillon et al 2018 navratil et al 2012 2010 orwin and smart 2004 the results obtained in this paper and in previous studies bring us to propose the following conceptual description of hysteresis and sediment configuration interactions fig 12 the dominant hysteresis effect observed at a given location in a catchment could depend on the upstream capacity to produce distant erosion and to buffer these upstream fluxes if the remobilization of fine sediments from the river bed did not exist mainly counterclockwise hysteresis should have been observed because of celerity differences between the flow rate and ssc waves klein 1984 thus the hysteresis patterns would depend on the location of the observation point for a given geomorphological scale point a b c or d in fig 12 following the conceptual configuration in fig 12 the fraction of ssl coming from the river bed and driven by the total flow rate could increase when moving to the downstream part of a catchment while ssl coming directly from primary hillslope sources and driven by rainfall or runoff could decrease such scale dependencies of hysteresis processes have been already noticed in hydrological studies gharari and razavi 2018 for instance davies and beven 2015 have shown by using a synthetic case that hysteresis between streamflow and catchment storage was changing with the catchment size considered 4 3 limitations and implications given the wide range of characteristics of the 10 studied alpine catchments comprising various sizes geologies altitudes hydrological and sedimentary regimes the proposed approach can be considered as relevant in other mountainous environments however its relevance should be tested in other contexts such as low land agricultural or arid environments the analysis of the sediment sources might be improved to get a more detailed description of the catchment sources configuration to investigate its relation with suspended load at shorter spatial and temporal scales for instance the mechanical properties of rocks in eroded areas could be taken into account to give more importance to soft rocks than to more resistant ones for catchments with contrasted lithologies the local river bed slope could also be explicitly considered in addition to the active river width to get a proxy of the buffering capacity of the bed this would probably give less importance to steep streams and more importance to gentle ones these potential improvements might be tested in future work however while the approach used does not represent all the complexity of interactions between suspended load and sediment source configuration a significant part of the variability of ssl hysteresis can be explained by this simplified source description at a regional scale this confirms the strong link between hysteresis processes and the variable sediment sources activation that have been qualitatively described for decades gellis 2013 gharari and razavi 2018 williams 1989 our results suggest that even for small catchments fine sediment dynamics and hysteresis effects could be largely influenced by erosion and deposition processes occurring in the river bed this might be the case in catchments where eroded areas are located far enough upstream so that the main channel can act as a buffering reservoir of fine sediments however larger catchments with well developed fluvial systems could conversely be influenced in a non negligible way by hillslope process production if some eroded areas are located at a short distance from the monitoring station both processes are probably inevitably linked the fractions of ssl coming from the bed or from the hillslopes seem to change depending on the point considered in the catchment the simple sediment sources analysis proposed in this study could be performed prior to the installation of a gauging station or prior to modeling effort in order to assess which kind of processes should be considered in a conceptual modeling approach it could also be helpful to determine the dominant fine sediment production process for river or dam management at the catchment scale 5 conclusions this study aimed at testing the links between discharge suspended sediment concentrations q ssc hysteresis and the spatial configuration of sediment sources which have been qualitatively considered for decades without been quantitatively tested a quantitative analysis of sediment sources configuration and q ssc hysteresis was performed in ten contrasted alpine catchments hysteresis indexes were calculated on a high number of automated sampled events to extract the dominant hysteresis pattern for each catchment simple indexes were developed to describe the river bed and eroded patches area distribution as well as a travelling distance to the outlet the main findings can be summarized as follows i considering the dominant ssl hysteresis in a given catchment as the most frequent pattern or as the most efficient in terms of transport can lead to different results our observations suggest that the transport efficiency of hysteresis should be considered to infer the dominant sediment production process this could be particularly true for catchments having most of their fluxes exported during few short events and exhibiting marked seasonal hysteresis variability thus an averaged mass weighted hysteresis index was proposed ii a strong correlation was found between mass weighted hysteresis index and sediment sources configuration index river bed vs eroded area which confirms the qualitative interpretations often made for ssc q hysteresis processes we also observed that the sources configuration should be considered on a long enough fraction of the catchment at least 50 of the whole principal river network upstream the observation point to explain the spatial hysteresis variability this is consistent with the rather long travelled distances of suspended particles iii in comparison to previous studies these results show the importance to consider not only general catchment properties or sediment sources to understand ssl dynamics but their spatial distribution and connectivity furthermore including bed related information increases significantly the explanatory power of the ssc q hysteresis variability than using only primary hillslope sources

6279,this study focused on the utility of coarse surface soil moisture observations for applications that require high resolution surface soil moisture information this was accomplished by quantifying the information content of average soil moisture for three different spatial scales of 81 km2 790 km2 and 4400 km2 in situ point observations of soil moisture from 31 stations in iowa were used to develop a spatial stochastic model that assumes hillslope scale model parameters are independent soil moisture dry downs and wetting regimes were analyzed using rain gauge and soil moisture sensor data the statistical nature of dry downs were parameterized using a power law decay and soil moisture increases due to rainfall were parameterized using a non dimensional logistic curve that is a function of soil moisture deficit the resulting stochastic model is used to quantify the magnitude of the standard deviation σ θ and skewness g θ as a function of the areal average we show that the greatest information content small spatial standard deviation of average observation corresponded to values near the minimum or the maximum soil moisture with σ θ 5 while average observations for intermediate soil moisture values had the lowest information content with σ θ 20 the differences in information content as a function of the areal average were consistent with the statistical nature of soil moisture that can be interpreted as small range bounded variable however this study provides quantitative estimates for the magnitude of the sub grid and basin scale variability documenting the utility for applications that require high resolution information these results form the basis for the investigation of spatial runoff production in response to rainfall and to inform plot scale agriculture applications keywords soil moisture variability satellite remote sensing sub grid basin 1 introduction surface soil moisture is a key state variable linking short term and long term water and energy balances in the soil and the atmosphere yang et al 2016 and land atmosphere interactions entekhabi et al 1996 that determine evaporation and evapotranspiration koster et al 2004 and surface runoff production leading to extreme flooding grillakis et al 2016 it also plays a major role in plant ecology environmental biology orchard and cook 1983 and carbon cycle through plant respiration boone et al 1998 the most common technique for field scale soil moisture measurement is using soil tdr time domain reflectometry probes topp et al 1980 romano 2014 however due to high spatial variability of soil moisture in space western et al 2004 yang et al 2017 using this measurement technique is neither feasible nor practical for larger spatial scales therefore remote sensing techniques are being employed as a more efficient alternative to track soil moisture in space and time nasa smap soil moisture active passive is the most recent satellite mission to focus on global soil moisture observations entekhabi et al 2010 launched in 2015 that uses l band 1 4 ghz radiometer satellite soil moisture estimations have coarse spatial resolution e g enhanced smap l3 9 km due to limitations in large antenna size needed for l band microwave measurements njoku and entekhabi 1996 kerr 2007 therefore understanding information content of the satellite soil moisture and its spatial variability for sub grid and basin scales is essential for its hydrologic applications several studies focused on characterization of the measured soil moisture distribution and its spatial variability over time using field observations e g famiglietti et al 1997 ryu and famiglietti 1997 choi and jacobs 2007 brocca et al 2012 cho and choi 2014 rosenbaum et al 2012 used 150 sensor observations to study soil moisture spatial variability and showed that groundwater influenced locations have higher spatial variability than other locations famiglietti et al 2008 analyzed the soil moisture spatial variability at spatial scales ranging from 800 m to 50 km their analysis demonstrated that larger spatial extents have higher variability brocca et al 2014 compared variability of absolute soil moisture degree of saturation and soil moisture anomalies with respect to long term mean for 6 observation networks with areas ranging from 250 to 150 000 km 2 in addition to studies based on observations only there have been studies that used modeling approach to investigate soil moisture variability for example teuling and troch 2005 used a soil moisture balance model to estimate soil moisture variability in 3 different sites controls of soil hydraulic properties specifically van genuchten mualem parameters on the relationship between soil moisture spatial variability with its mean has been investigated by different studies e g garcía et al 2014 qu et al 2015 wang et al 2015 zarlenga et al 2018 adopted a stochastic model of unsaturated flow to investigate the effects of a scaling triplet spacing extent and support introduced by andrew and günter 1999 on the soil moisture spatial variability chaney et al 2015 used the toplats model sivapalan et al 1987 to estimate watershed scale spatial variability of root zone soil moisture using fine scale 500 m radar rainfall data application of three dimensional hydrologic model for estimation of soil moisture variability has also been investigated by cornelissen et al 2014 and gebler et al 2017 reported results from those two modeling studies indicate underestimation of spatial variability from modeled soil moisture compared to observations for details on current status of soil moisture spatio temporal variability research the reader is referred to section 3 of brocca et al 2017 and section 8 in babaeian et al 2018 in previous studies soil moisture sensor observations play a key role in understanding spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture and evaluation of soil moisture estimations from model simulations these studies demonstrate the added value of field measurements of soil moisture the main objective of this study is to investigate soil moisture variability within smap satellite sub grid and basin spatial scales by analyzing soil moisture sensor and rain gauge observations and using higher resolution radar rainfall and soil properties to approximate spatial statistics of surface soil moisture section 2 describes the domains of study and data characteristics that are used section 2 3 discusses the methodology for extraction of the soil dry downs and wetting phases the parameterization of each phase and a description of the soil moisture model in results and discussion section 3 we compare stochastic model results with smap and soil moisture sensor s for one smap pixel within each basin and at the basin scale thereafter we investigate the soil moisture spatial statistics of the proposed model and compare it with field observations and smap satellite soil moisture 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area two watersheds fig 1 located in iowa are the focus of this study iowa is located in a warm and humid continental climate zone e g peel et al 2007 with an annual average precipitation of 870 mm 1981 2010 the turkey river basin is located at northeast iowa and has a drainage area of 4400 km 2 it is approximately 56 cropland 14 pasture 13 of the basin is forested and the remaining area is grassland and developed the south fork basin is located in north central iowa with a drainage area of 790 km 2 cropland dominates the land cover with 88 of the total area the main soil texture based on usda classes for the turkey river and south fork basins are silt loam and loam respectively 2 2 data 2 2 1 field measurements fig 1 shows available soil moisture and rain gauges in the state of iowa usa at each site 4 soil moisture sensors are installed at depths of 5 10 20 and 50 cm this study will focus on the 5 cm depth of soil column at each site the ifc iowa flood center tdr probes are campbell cs655 campbell scientific inc 2012 and the usda ars soil moisture sensors are stevens hydra probes stevens 2018 both soil moisture sensors have a reported accuracy from 1 to 3 volumetric soil moisture at each site dual tipping bucket rain gauges are collocated with the soil moisture sensors it has been shown that dual tipping bucket rain gauges for rainfall measurements increases the measurement reliability ciach et al 1999 the temporal coverage of the soil moisture and rainfall data for different sites is shown in fig 2 for quality control of soil moisture data we followed dorigo et al 2011 for detection of errors in soil moisture time series we applied a manual quality control on the soil moisture sensor data we removed the cold season time periods november 1 march 31 highlighted as gray in fig 2 to avoid possible erroneous soil moisture readings due to frozen top soil layer also we used rainfall data from two tipping bucket rain gauges at each site to check the soil moisture time series if there was rainfall more than 5 mm and soil moisture did not increase during a 24 h period we avoided using the data we did not remove temperature related diurnal fluctuations in soil moisture because these fluctuations are within the specified accuracy of sensors 2 2 2 radar rainfall satellite soil moisture for rainfall we used mrms multi radar multi sensor a rain gauge bias corrected radar rainfall product zhang et al 2016 that has approximately a 1 km resolution we employed hourly rainfall from april to november 2016 as forcing for estimation of the soil moisture for each hillslope which is discussed in the section 2 3 3 enhanced level 3 version 1 hereafter l3 smap chaubell et al 2016 soil moisture product has approximately 9 km resolution with global revisit time of 2 3 days smap soil moisture estimations are provided by nasa on ease grid 2 hereafter smap grid there are 21 and 73 smap pixels that intersect with south fork and turkey river basins respectively we use smap soil moisture for comparisons with sensor observations and simulated hillslope soil moisture 2 2 3 soil properties two soil properties used in this study are porosity and residual soil moisture these two values for 0 5 cm soil layer were obtained from the polaris soil properties database which is a probabilistic soil series map for the contiguous united states and has a 30 m spatial resolution chaney et al 2016 2 3 methods field scale soil moisture dynamics could be classified into two phases soil moisture dry down that is due to drainage and evaporation evapotranspiration while soil wetting is due to rainfall and or irrigation noting that most of the agricultural fields in iowa are rain fed we analyzed the soil moisture dry downs and wetting phases of soil moisture time series then we parameterized these two phases and used the distributions of parameters for estimation of the hillslope surface soil moisture forced with mrms rainfall 2 3 1 dry down periods the dry down time periods of surface soil moisture were identified using local minimum and maximums of the soil moisture time series a threshold peak prominence value of 0 02 m 3 m 3 was used and the dry down curves that last at least 12 h were selected also dry downs with more than 2 mm accumulated rainfall were excluded from the analysis consequently 2352 dry down events are employed in the study rondinelli et al 2015 and shellito et al 2016 used an exponential equation with different mathematical forms for fitting the soil moisture dry down curves using 3 parameters for this study we selected a power law model with two parameters for fitting the dry down curves to improve flexibility and to decrease the number of parameters required 1 sm t τ sm τ sm r β 1 α t τ 1 1 1 β sm r where sm τ is soil moisture at the initiation of dry down sm t τ is soil moisture at any time t τ elapsed from the dry down initiation and sm r is residual soil moisture which is assumed as minimum soil moisture of the time series eq 1 is fitted to extracted dry down curves from soil moisture observations with a non linear least square method to find α and β for each dry down curve fig 4 shows the normalized dry down curves based on initial soil moisture of the dry downs for ifc soil moisture sensors with elapsed time t τ in days each of the fitted curves have different dry down parameters α β fitted and observed dry down curves have a good agreement with an rmse root mean square error and coefficient of determination of 0 006 cm 3 cm 3 and 0 95 respectively 2 3 2 wetting phase the total rainfall and magnitude of soil moisture increase during rainfall events are found for each wetting time periods from soil moisture time series an example of these periods are highlighted as blue in fig 3 using a similar approach described in section 2 3 1 with an inter event dry period of 2 h we found positive soil moisture change and total rainfall depth we detected 4334 wetting periods across the sensor histories hardie et al 2013 investigated soil moisture change with respect to rainfall for 0 90 cm depths they were able to find weak but significant relationship between the amount of precipitation and soil moisture change in our study we only used surface soil moisture measurements 5 cm depth and we normalized the magnitude of soil moisture increase over the wetting period by soil moisture deficit ϕ sm i defined as the difference between soil porosity and initial soil moisture before initiation of the rainfall event furthermore we normalized total rainfall by the sensing depth of soil moisture sensor and soil moisture deficit fig 5 shows the non dimensional deficit normalized soil moisture increase with respect to deficit normalized rainfall over wetting periods for all of the stations in this study each point demonstrates what percentage of available space at top layer soil is filled up by rainfall most of the data points are close to one to one line while soil moisture change is higher for higher magnitudes of deficit normalized rainfall in the case of an ideal bucket model one may expect that deficit normalized soil moisture increase of surface soil layer should correspond with deficit normalized rainfall magnitudes in other words sm f sm i ϕ sm i p ϕ sm i d sv if p ϕ sm i d sv 1 1 if p ϕ sm i d sv 1 our data analysis shows that there is uncertainty in soil moisture change with respect to rainfall there are different factors that could be contributing to the scattering of the data points in fig 5 changes in soil porosity macropores and preferential flow e g beven and germann 1982 could contribute to the scattering preferential flow can also contribute to larger deficit normalized soil moisture increase than deficit normalized rainfall magnitude which is neglected in our study due to insignificant instances of these events investigating the effect of above mentioned factors on soil moisture change has its own challenges guo et al 2018 and does not fit in the scope of this study given the limitations of the available information and temporal resolution of rainfall and soil moisture observations nevertheless it is important to account for these factors in hydrologic modeling and the authors would like to express the need for further research an asymptotic equation eq 2 with one parameter γ is chosen to solve for each point shown in fig 5 2 sm f sm i p d sv 1 p d sv ϕ sm i γ 1 γ where p is the total rainfall depth over the wetting period ϕ is soil porosity assumed as maximum soil moisture of the observations at each station d sv is effective depth of sensing volume for the soil moisture sensors used in this study which is approximately 75 mm sm i and sm f are soil moisture before and after the soil moisture wetting event also shown as black circles and black dots in fig 3 respectively solving eq 2 for each point in fig 5 gives different γ values for which its distribution is shown in fig 5 we note that the functional form in eq 2 imposes a constraint on the soil moisture increase to be less than or equal to its deficit we investigated a possible relationship between the dry down curve parameters α and β and geophysical attributes of each site including soil temperature soil texture slope we could not find any clear and distinct relationship between soil moisture dry down parameters α β and these attributes however we found similarity in normalized dry down rates but also significant variability in normalized soil moisture sm sm τ dry downs for concurrent dry downs across stations 2 3 3 numerical modeling a surface soil moisture time series was generated based on eq 1 and eq 2 we note that the fitted dry down parameters are discrete in time because we only have one pair of α and β for a single dry down curve therefore to have sufficient number of parameter samples and to account for variability of dry down parameters in different time of year a soil moisture dry down is generated right after cessation of rainfall as follows first we select the dry down parameters that are within a 40 day time window τ 20 days of dry down initiation time or rainfall cessation time denoted as τ in eq 1 then we construct non parametric distributions from which we sample α and β finally by plugging sampled parameters into eq 1 we estimate the soil moisture dry down until the next rainfall initiation time note that as it is shown in eq 1 a soil moisture dry down only depends on the initial soil moisture of the dry down sm τ which is calculated from a previous wetting residual soil moisture sm r from polaris database and α and β which are randomly sampled for each dry down as described above for soil moisture wetting during a rainfall event we randomized the soil moisture response to each pulse of rainfall first we sample from the distribution of wetting phase parameter γ shown in fig 5 then we calculate the soil moisture change by plugging the sampled γ into eq 2 while the initial soil moisture sm i is already calculated either from the final value of a dry down or soil moisture of the previous time step of a wetting we repeat this procedure until rainfall ends we use hourly mrms rainfall at each hillslope by calculating the area weighted average rainfall of the contributing mrms pixels the initial soil moisture of the hillslopes on april 1st 2016 were generated randomly with a uniform distribution ranging from residual saturation to soil porosity simulations are conducted for each basin separately with their corresponding calculated parameters we note that turkey river and south fork basins have approximately 10 800 and 1800 hillslopes respectively fig 6 shows a schematic of one smap pixel intersecting mrms rainfall grid and hillslopes each smap grid consists of approximately 100 mrms grids and more than 300 hillslopes normalized soil moisture standard deviation and skewness are compared with its mean for model and sensor observations also these three statistics are calculated for smap soil moisture and upscaled model soil moisture over turkey river basin for upscaling the model soil moisture to smap pixel resolution spatial mean of normalized model soil moisture is calculated for hillslopes that are within smap pixel thereafter upscaled model soil moisture time series is subset over time by using the matching timestamps of smap satellite overpass the differences in spatial variability of absolute soil moisture and normalized soil moisture degree of saturation is shown by brocca et al 2014 hence for spatial statistics mean standard deviation and skewness of sensor observations model and smap soil moisture we used normalized soil moisture or effective saturation defined as 3 θ sm sm r ϕ sm r where θ is normalized soil moisture degree of saturation that changes from 0 to 1 sm is volumetric water content that can change between residual soil moisture sm r and soil porosity ϕ for sensor observations we used minimum and maximum soil moisture of the sensor history as porosity and residual soil moisture respectively for normalization of model soil moisture and smap soil moisture we used polaris soil porosity and residual soil moisture for the sake of completeness definitions of mean standard deviation and skewness are given in eqs 4 6 4 e θ 1 n i 1 n θ i 5 σ θ i 1 n θ i e θ 6 g θ 1 n i 1 n θ i e θ 3 σ θ 3 where n is the number of hillslopes θ i is normalized soil moisture at i th hillslope and e θ is the mean soil moisture of the hillslopes it is important to highlight that the independence of point scale model parameters does not imply independence of the time series that are generated a strong correlation between sites is maintained because spatial patterns of precipitation are correlated 3 results and discussions 3 1 smap sub grid soil moisture soil moisture estimates for one smap pixel inside turkey river and south fork basins are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively we selected smap pixels that contain at least one soil moisture sensor which are highlighted with red color in these figures longitude and latitude of the centroid for smap pixel in turkey river basin and south fork are 91 4680 42 7813 and 93 4537 42 4914 decimal degrees respectively the top panel shows hourly mrms rainfall averaged over hillslopes within one smap pixel the color scale shows the soil moisture probability of occurrence p sm inside the smap grid for april november 2016 descending and ascending swaths of the smap satellite are shown with downward and upward triangles also time series of soil moisture sensor s collocated with smap pixel is shown in black line for smap pixels within each basin soil moisture from smap and in situ stations were inside the range of modeled soil moisture higher rainfall magnitudes tended to increase the probability of higher soil moisture within smap pixel from model overall smap soil moisture wettings and dry downs agreed with the model and sensor however generally smap soil moisture estimations are lower than other two more specifically smap soil moisture is drier than sensor and model soil moisture from june to september 3 2 basin scale soil moisture figs 9 and 10 from top to bottom panel show basin averaged hourly rainfall from the mrms product simulated soil moisture probability of occurrence over time with median soil moisture of all of the hillslopes within each basin red line the corresponding smap soil moisture as box plots with dark and light gray colors referring to am and pm swaths of smap satellite and time series of soil moisture observations inside each basin the maximum number of sensors used for turkey river basin and south fork are 15 and 16 respectively there was good agreement between sensor observations and simulated time series of soil moisture where sensor observations are within the range of simulated soil moisture for the two basins in few cases specifically for south fork sensor observations exceeded the saturation level of the model that could be originating from either flow accumulation at soil moisture sensor location or lower soil porosity used in the model smap soil moisture observations lie inside the simulated range however there are moments in time where smap estimations are lower than residual saturation more specifically smap soil moisture for south fork basin exhibited lower soil moisture values than the residual saturation for june august 2016 this could be due to the vegetation growing season in iowa where l band radiometric sensitivity to vegetation water content vwc increases that conversely decreases sensitivity to soil moisture neelam and mohanty 2015 spatial variability of smap soil moisture for south fork was less than turkey river due to the smaller watershed area and thus fewer smap pixels smap soil moisture estimates tend to dry down faster than estimated soil moisture of the hillslopes which is consistent with the study on the smap moisture dry down rates shellito et al 2016 and an overall assessment of smap soil moisture products chan et al 2016 chen et al 2018 speculated that underestimation in auxiliary surface temperature of smap could be one of the contributors to dry bias of smap soil moisture estimates 3 3 standard deviation and skewness hourly standard deviation with respect to mean of normalized model and observed soil moisture for turkey river and south fork are shown in fig 11 standard deviation is maximum in the intermediate range of soil moisture while it is lower for low and high soil moisture mean values the overall trend and dynamic range for the mean and standard deviation of observed soil moisture is captured by the model for turkey river basin the standard deviation of the modeled and observed soil moisture for wet conditions was lower than dry conditions while for south fork basin the lower limits of standard deviation for wet and dry conditions had similar values for the time period of our study maximum standard deviation of observed soil moisture for turkey river basin fig 11a is 0 29 cm 3 cm 3 with mean value of 0 54 cm 3 cm 3 whereas the peak standard deviation of observations for south fork fig 11b is approximately 0 30 cm 3 cm 3 at mean soil moisture of 0 35 cm 3 cm 3 soil moisture variability results by gebler et al 2017 using hydrologic model were lower than the observed soil moisture spatial variability because of uniform atmospheric forcing e g rainfall and vegetation over their study domain modeled soil moisture variability results from cornelissen et al 2014 also showed an underestimation compared to observations due to homogeneous rainfall forcing in contrast to these two studies our model results for soil moisture variability are slightly higher than observations which can be attributed to rainfall variability in space fig 12 shows changes of skewness with mean soil moisture for turkey river and south fork basins respectively soil moisture skewness of the model and observations show good agreement for both watersheds the distribution is negatively skewed for wet conditions while skewness becomes positive for dry conditions this result is in the same line with conclusions by famiglietti et al 2008 while general patterns of standard deviation and skewness with respect to mean are captured by the proposed model there are differences in modeled and observed normalized soil moisture statistics with respect to its mean one reason for this difference could be due to normalization of observations by using maximum and minimum of the soil moisture sensor history as porosity and residual soil moisture note that the number of hillslopes sample size for which the statistics are calculated in figs 11 and 12 is not same as the number of sensor observations in these basins therefore for comparisons between observed and modeled soil moisture standard deviation and skewness same number of hillslopes as the number of sensor observations was selected randomly inside each basin and statistics were calculated for each group accordingly figs 13 and 14 correspond to standard deviation and skewness of normalized soil moisture with respect to its mean these two figures show the statistics for groups of 15 and 16 hillslopes for turkey river and south fork basins dynamic range of the statistics in these two figures cover the standard deviation and skewness of the soil moisture sensor observations within each basin in contrast to south fork basin modeled soil moisture standard deviations reach zero for very wet conditions in turkey river basin because of high rainfall spatial extent the range of observed soil moisture skewness for turkey river basin and south fork are within the range of ensemble skewness of the model turkey river basin is 6 times larger than south fork therefore the range for soil moisture standard deviation and skewness is higher for a given mean previous studies such as andrew and günter 1999 and famiglietti et al 2008 have shown that as spatial extent increases soil moisture standard deviation increases our results show that normalized soil moisture standard deviation is maximum at intermediate range θ 0 5 these results are consistent with the findings from previous studies e g famiglietti et al 1998 choi and jacobs 2007 famiglietti et al 2008 rosenbaum et al 2012 cho and choi 2014 where the relationship between standard deviation of soil moisture with its mean was found to be downward concave upward convex we note that upper bound of variance for a bounded random variable follows bhatia davis inequality bhatia and davis 2000 7 σ 2 θ m e θ e θ m where θ is normalized soil moisture that is bounded between m 1 and m 0 the maximum possible variance is 0 25 that corresponds to e θ 0 5 while variance is zero at the two bounds therefore the upward convex relationship between mean and standard deviation variance of normalized soil moisture is its inherent statistical property we further compare the variations of normalized soil moisture statistics over time using the same approach described previously for generating results shown in figs 13 and 14 fig 15 shows model approximations for upper and lower bounds of soil moisture standard deviation and skewness over time for turkey river and south fork basins soil moisture variability and skewness decreases for rainfall events with high spatial extent temporal variations of standard deviation and skewness for observations and model generally have good agreement as previously shown in fig 10 the observed sensor soil moisture values are within the range of modeled soil moisture over time while there are few instances in time where standard deviation of the observations is slightly lower than that of approximated possible standard deviations for south fork basin fig 15c note that as it is discussed by chaney et al 2015 lack of soil moisture sensors in wet regions will lead to underestimation in standard deviation compared to model estimations specially over dry periods 3 4 spatial variability and skewness of smap soil moisture spatial statistics of upscaled model and smap satellite soil moisture over turkey river basin are also calculated fig 16 shows standard deviation and skewness of smap soil moisture and upscaled model soil moisture over turkey river basin for 65 pixels whereas each pixel covers at least 20 hillslopes upward and downward triangles in this figure correspond to ascending pm and descending am smap satellite orbits respectively the standard deviation and skewness of upscaled model soil moisture and smap satellite soil moisture over turkey river basin are in a similar dynamic ranges however the mean values of smap satellite soil moisture are generally lower than mean of upscaled model soil moisture compared to spatial variability of soil moisture in basin scale which is shown in fig 11a fig 16a suggests that standard deviation of upscaled model is lower due to averaging of hillslope soil moisture over smap pixels that has approximate support length of 9 km this result is consistent with findings from andrew and günter 1999 and zarlenga et al 2018 that showed increasing support length decreases soil moisture spatial variance fig 16b shows skewness for upscaled model and smap soil moisture over turkey river basin there is similar trend as shown in fig 12a whereas skewness is negative for wet and becomes positive in dry conditions for smap and upscaled model as previously mentioned we averaged the soil moisture of the hillslopes collocated with a given smap pixel although averaging as an upscaling approach shows comparable results in terms of soil moisture variability however as njoku and entekhabi 1996 suggested due to horizontal heterogeneities within satellite footprint the retrieved average soil moisture of satellite remote sensing in most of the cases may not be representative of the spatial average of soil moisture further studies on this aspect using data from field campaigns such as smapvex campaigns can help in understanding the spatial aggregation scheme of the satellite 4 summary conclusions in this study we focused on the parameterization of dry down and wetting phases of surface soil moisture and extraction of the parameter distributions for each phase using 31 rainfall and soil moisture measurements over two basins we used the extracted statistical information from soil moisture sensors and we simulated surface soil moisture at each hillslope by bringing higher resolution information on soil properties and rainfall we compared observed modeled and smap satellite soil moisture estimates over the study period furthermore we investigated sub grid and basin scale soil moisture variability taking all the above mentioned points into consideration the following conclusions can be drawn smap soil moisture responded to rainfall events while generally it increased less than observed and modeled soil moisture for the study period in most of the cases smap underestimated soil moisture during dry down periods there were only few cases where smap soil moisture was slightly higher than observed and modeled soil moisture satellite soil moisture retrievals are sensitive to vwc vegetation water content smap uses a 10 year 2000 2010 climatological average for vwc which is derived from modis kim 2013 smap estimates for turkey river basin were slightly higher than south fork part of this could be due to less cropland proportion in turkey river basin 56 compared to south fork 88 field observations of soil moisture for the two basins corresponded very well with the modeled soil moisture where they lie inside the range of simulated soil moisture for 2016 moreover standard deviation and skewness of the two watersheds exhibited different behaviors from each other originating from different soil properties and wetness which was captured by the proposed model thus demonstrating the model skill in replicating the soil moisture statistics in theory for two extreme cases of very wet and dry conditions with large spatial extent over the basins the distribution of soil moisture for a given basin should approach to distributions of soil porosity and residual soil moisture over the study area our results indicate that for dry wet and medium soil moisture conditions soil moisture skewness become positive negative and close to zero respectively which is consistent with findings from previous studies e g cho and choi 2014 famiglietti et al 1997 we show that as the number of hillslopes samples for which the statistics are calculated increases for a given mean soil moisture uncertainty in standard deviation and skewness decreases spatial variability and skewness of the upscaled model soil moisture is found to be comparable with smap soil moisture over turkey river basin suggesting that averaging over larger support length decreases variability the relationship between soil moisture variability with its mean from soil moisture sensors and the proposed model implies that uncertainty in soil moisture for two cases of wet and dry conditions decreases to values close to zero this relationship could be used as an insight for inferring the information content of the satellite soil moisture estimations and its applications we have compared our results with satellite soil moisture in terms of spatial variability in basin scale and in probabilistic sense for sub grid scale further research is needed for connecting the information content of satellite estimations to field scale or hillslope scale soil moisture while analysis of data from field campaigns could be helpful with this respect in this study we only addressed the surface soil moisture dynamics which is more relevant to satellite soil moisture our methodology could be used in basins that have soil moisture observations such as international soil moisture networks dorigo et al 2011 and ground based radar rainfall zhang et al 2016 harrison et al 2009 or satellite rainfall products e g huffman et al 2015 for estimating basin scale or satellite soil moisture sub grid variability the main limitation of our study is that its application depends on availability of recent historical soil moisture sensor rain gauge data for analysis and fine resolution radar rainfall data for simulations future studies developed by this methodology could account for longer time periods the errors in radar rainfall and uncertainty in soil properties for more accurate depiction of basin and sub grid soil moisture distributions also our study demonstrated the importance of field observations for further understanding of the surface soil moisture variability this methodology could be expanded to lower soil layers by extracting statistical information from soil moisture observations at each depth and coupling between them for partitioning of rainfall to runoff and more specifically drought and flood forecasting credit authorship contribution statement navid

6279,this study focused on the utility of coarse surface soil moisture observations for applications that require high resolution surface soil moisture information this was accomplished by quantifying the information content of average soil moisture for three different spatial scales of 81 km2 790 km2 and 4400 km2 in situ point observations of soil moisture from 31 stations in iowa were used to develop a spatial stochastic model that assumes hillslope scale model parameters are independent soil moisture dry downs and wetting regimes were analyzed using rain gauge and soil moisture sensor data the statistical nature of dry downs were parameterized using a power law decay and soil moisture increases due to rainfall were parameterized using a non dimensional logistic curve that is a function of soil moisture deficit the resulting stochastic model is used to quantify the magnitude of the standard deviation σ θ and skewness g θ as a function of the areal average we show that the greatest information content small spatial standard deviation of average observation corresponded to values near the minimum or the maximum soil moisture with σ θ 5 while average observations for intermediate soil moisture values had the lowest information content with σ θ 20 the differences in information content as a function of the areal average were consistent with the statistical nature of soil moisture that can be interpreted as small range bounded variable however this study provides quantitative estimates for the magnitude of the sub grid and basin scale variability documenting the utility for applications that require high resolution information these results form the basis for the investigation of spatial runoff production in response to rainfall and to inform plot scale agriculture applications keywords soil moisture variability satellite remote sensing sub grid basin 1 introduction surface soil moisture is a key state variable linking short term and long term water and energy balances in the soil and the atmosphere yang et al 2016 and land atmosphere interactions entekhabi et al 1996 that determine evaporation and evapotranspiration koster et al 2004 and surface runoff production leading to extreme flooding grillakis et al 2016 it also plays a major role in plant ecology environmental biology orchard and cook 1983 and carbon cycle through plant respiration boone et al 1998 the most common technique for field scale soil moisture measurement is using soil tdr time domain reflectometry probes topp et al 1980 romano 2014 however due to high spatial variability of soil moisture in space western et al 2004 yang et al 2017 using this measurement technique is neither feasible nor practical for larger spatial scales therefore remote sensing techniques are being employed as a more efficient alternative to track soil moisture in space and time nasa smap soil moisture active passive is the most recent satellite mission to focus on global soil moisture observations entekhabi et al 2010 launched in 2015 that uses l band 1 4 ghz radiometer satellite soil moisture estimations have coarse spatial resolution e g enhanced smap l3 9 km due to limitations in large antenna size needed for l band microwave measurements njoku and entekhabi 1996 kerr 2007 therefore understanding information content of the satellite soil moisture and its spatial variability for sub grid and basin scales is essential for its hydrologic applications several studies focused on characterization of the measured soil moisture distribution and its spatial variability over time using field observations e g famiglietti et al 1997 ryu and famiglietti 1997 choi and jacobs 2007 brocca et al 2012 cho and choi 2014 rosenbaum et al 2012 used 150 sensor observations to study soil moisture spatial variability and showed that groundwater influenced locations have higher spatial variability than other locations famiglietti et al 2008 analyzed the soil moisture spatial variability at spatial scales ranging from 800 m to 50 km their analysis demonstrated that larger spatial extents have higher variability brocca et al 2014 compared variability of absolute soil moisture degree of saturation and soil moisture anomalies with respect to long term mean for 6 observation networks with areas ranging from 250 to 150 000 km 2 in addition to studies based on observations only there have been studies that used modeling approach to investigate soil moisture variability for example teuling and troch 2005 used a soil moisture balance model to estimate soil moisture variability in 3 different sites controls of soil hydraulic properties specifically van genuchten mualem parameters on the relationship between soil moisture spatial variability with its mean has been investigated by different studies e g garcía et al 2014 qu et al 2015 wang et al 2015 zarlenga et al 2018 adopted a stochastic model of unsaturated flow to investigate the effects of a scaling triplet spacing extent and support introduced by andrew and günter 1999 on the soil moisture spatial variability chaney et al 2015 used the toplats model sivapalan et al 1987 to estimate watershed scale spatial variability of root zone soil moisture using fine scale 500 m radar rainfall data application of three dimensional hydrologic model for estimation of soil moisture variability has also been investigated by cornelissen et al 2014 and gebler et al 2017 reported results from those two modeling studies indicate underestimation of spatial variability from modeled soil moisture compared to observations for details on current status of soil moisture spatio temporal variability research the reader is referred to section 3 of brocca et al 2017 and section 8 in babaeian et al 2018 in previous studies soil moisture sensor observations play a key role in understanding spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture and evaluation of soil moisture estimations from model simulations these studies demonstrate the added value of field measurements of soil moisture the main objective of this study is to investigate soil moisture variability within smap satellite sub grid and basin spatial scales by analyzing soil moisture sensor and rain gauge observations and using higher resolution radar rainfall and soil properties to approximate spatial statistics of surface soil moisture section 2 describes the domains of study and data characteristics that are used section 2 3 discusses the methodology for extraction of the soil dry downs and wetting phases the parameterization of each phase and a description of the soil moisture model in results and discussion section 3 we compare stochastic model results with smap and soil moisture sensor s for one smap pixel within each basin and at the basin scale thereafter we investigate the soil moisture spatial statistics of the proposed model and compare it with field observations and smap satellite soil moisture 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area two watersheds fig 1 located in iowa are the focus of this study iowa is located in a warm and humid continental climate zone e g peel et al 2007 with an annual average precipitation of 870 mm 1981 2010 the turkey river basin is located at northeast iowa and has a drainage area of 4400 km 2 it is approximately 56 cropland 14 pasture 13 of the basin is forested and the remaining area is grassland and developed the south fork basin is located in north central iowa with a drainage area of 790 km 2 cropland dominates the land cover with 88 of the total area the main soil texture based on usda classes for the turkey river and south fork basins are silt loam and loam respectively 2 2 data 2 2 1 field measurements fig 1 shows available soil moisture and rain gauges in the state of iowa usa at each site 4 soil moisture sensors are installed at depths of 5 10 20 and 50 cm this study will focus on the 5 cm depth of soil column at each site the ifc iowa flood center tdr probes are campbell cs655 campbell scientific inc 2012 and the usda ars soil moisture sensors are stevens hydra probes stevens 2018 both soil moisture sensors have a reported accuracy from 1 to 3 volumetric soil moisture at each site dual tipping bucket rain gauges are collocated with the soil moisture sensors it has been shown that dual tipping bucket rain gauges for rainfall measurements increases the measurement reliability ciach et al 1999 the temporal coverage of the soil moisture and rainfall data for different sites is shown in fig 2 for quality control of soil moisture data we followed dorigo et al 2011 for detection of errors in soil moisture time series we applied a manual quality control on the soil moisture sensor data we removed the cold season time periods november 1 march 31 highlighted as gray in fig 2 to avoid possible erroneous soil moisture readings due to frozen top soil layer also we used rainfall data from two tipping bucket rain gauges at each site to check the soil moisture time series if there was rainfall more than 5 mm and soil moisture did not increase during a 24 h period we avoided using the data we did not remove temperature related diurnal fluctuations in soil moisture because these fluctuations are within the specified accuracy of sensors 2 2 2 radar rainfall satellite soil moisture for rainfall we used mrms multi radar multi sensor a rain gauge bias corrected radar rainfall product zhang et al 2016 that has approximately a 1 km resolution we employed hourly rainfall from april to november 2016 as forcing for estimation of the soil moisture for each hillslope which is discussed in the section 2 3 3 enhanced level 3 version 1 hereafter l3 smap chaubell et al 2016 soil moisture product has approximately 9 km resolution with global revisit time of 2 3 days smap soil moisture estimations are provided by nasa on ease grid 2 hereafter smap grid there are 21 and 73 smap pixels that intersect with south fork and turkey river basins respectively we use smap soil moisture for comparisons with sensor observations and simulated hillslope soil moisture 2 2 3 soil properties two soil properties used in this study are porosity and residual soil moisture these two values for 0 5 cm soil layer were obtained from the polaris soil properties database which is a probabilistic soil series map for the contiguous united states and has a 30 m spatial resolution chaney et al 2016 2 3 methods field scale soil moisture dynamics could be classified into two phases soil moisture dry down that is due to drainage and evaporation evapotranspiration while soil wetting is due to rainfall and or irrigation noting that most of the agricultural fields in iowa are rain fed we analyzed the soil moisture dry downs and wetting phases of soil moisture time series then we parameterized these two phases and used the distributions of parameters for estimation of the hillslope surface soil moisture forced with mrms rainfall 2 3 1 dry down periods the dry down time periods of surface soil moisture were identified using local minimum and maximums of the soil moisture time series a threshold peak prominence value of 0 02 m 3 m 3 was used and the dry down curves that last at least 12 h were selected also dry downs with more than 2 mm accumulated rainfall were excluded from the analysis consequently 2352 dry down events are employed in the study rondinelli et al 2015 and shellito et al 2016 used an exponential equation with different mathematical forms for fitting the soil moisture dry down curves using 3 parameters for this study we selected a power law model with two parameters for fitting the dry down curves to improve flexibility and to decrease the number of parameters required 1 sm t τ sm τ sm r β 1 α t τ 1 1 1 β sm r where sm τ is soil moisture at the initiation of dry down sm t τ is soil moisture at any time t τ elapsed from the dry down initiation and sm r is residual soil moisture which is assumed as minimum soil moisture of the time series eq 1 is fitted to extracted dry down curves from soil moisture observations with a non linear least square method to find α and β for each dry down curve fig 4 shows the normalized dry down curves based on initial soil moisture of the dry downs for ifc soil moisture sensors with elapsed time t τ in days each of the fitted curves have different dry down parameters α β fitted and observed dry down curves have a good agreement with an rmse root mean square error and coefficient of determination of 0 006 cm 3 cm 3 and 0 95 respectively 2 3 2 wetting phase the total rainfall and magnitude of soil moisture increase during rainfall events are found for each wetting time periods from soil moisture time series an example of these periods are highlighted as blue in fig 3 using a similar approach described in section 2 3 1 with an inter event dry period of 2 h we found positive soil moisture change and total rainfall depth we detected 4334 wetting periods across the sensor histories hardie et al 2013 investigated soil moisture change with respect to rainfall for 0 90 cm depths they were able to find weak but significant relationship between the amount of precipitation and soil moisture change in our study we only used surface soil moisture measurements 5 cm depth and we normalized the magnitude of soil moisture increase over the wetting period by soil moisture deficit ϕ sm i defined as the difference between soil porosity and initial soil moisture before initiation of the rainfall event furthermore we normalized total rainfall by the sensing depth of soil moisture sensor and soil moisture deficit fig 5 shows the non dimensional deficit normalized soil moisture increase with respect to deficit normalized rainfall over wetting periods for all of the stations in this study each point demonstrates what percentage of available space at top layer soil is filled up by rainfall most of the data points are close to one to one line while soil moisture change is higher for higher magnitudes of deficit normalized rainfall in the case of an ideal bucket model one may expect that deficit normalized soil moisture increase of surface soil layer should correspond with deficit normalized rainfall magnitudes in other words sm f sm i ϕ sm i p ϕ sm i d sv if p ϕ sm i d sv 1 1 if p ϕ sm i d sv 1 our data analysis shows that there is uncertainty in soil moisture change with respect to rainfall there are different factors that could be contributing to the scattering of the data points in fig 5 changes in soil porosity macropores and preferential flow e g beven and germann 1982 could contribute to the scattering preferential flow can also contribute to larger deficit normalized soil moisture increase than deficit normalized rainfall magnitude which is neglected in our study due to insignificant instances of these events investigating the effect of above mentioned factors on soil moisture change has its own challenges guo et al 2018 and does not fit in the scope of this study given the limitations of the available information and temporal resolution of rainfall and soil moisture observations nevertheless it is important to account for these factors in hydrologic modeling and the authors would like to express the need for further research an asymptotic equation eq 2 with one parameter γ is chosen to solve for each point shown in fig 5 2 sm f sm i p d sv 1 p d sv ϕ sm i γ 1 γ where p is the total rainfall depth over the wetting period ϕ is soil porosity assumed as maximum soil moisture of the observations at each station d sv is effective depth of sensing volume for the soil moisture sensors used in this study which is approximately 75 mm sm i and sm f are soil moisture before and after the soil moisture wetting event also shown as black circles and black dots in fig 3 respectively solving eq 2 for each point in fig 5 gives different γ values for which its distribution is shown in fig 5 we note that the functional form in eq 2 imposes a constraint on the soil moisture increase to be less than or equal to its deficit we investigated a possible relationship between the dry down curve parameters α and β and geophysical attributes of each site including soil temperature soil texture slope we could not find any clear and distinct relationship between soil moisture dry down parameters α β and these attributes however we found similarity in normalized dry down rates but also significant variability in normalized soil moisture sm sm τ dry downs for concurrent dry downs across stations 2 3 3 numerical modeling a surface soil moisture time series was generated based on eq 1 and eq 2 we note that the fitted dry down parameters are discrete in time because we only have one pair of α and β for a single dry down curve therefore to have sufficient number of parameter samples and to account for variability of dry down parameters in different time of year a soil moisture dry down is generated right after cessation of rainfall as follows first we select the dry down parameters that are within a 40 day time window τ 20 days of dry down initiation time or rainfall cessation time denoted as τ in eq 1 then we construct non parametric distributions from which we sample α and β finally by plugging sampled parameters into eq 1 we estimate the soil moisture dry down until the next rainfall initiation time note that as it is shown in eq 1 a soil moisture dry down only depends on the initial soil moisture of the dry down sm τ which is calculated from a previous wetting residual soil moisture sm r from polaris database and α and β which are randomly sampled for each dry down as described above for soil moisture wetting during a rainfall event we randomized the soil moisture response to each pulse of rainfall first we sample from the distribution of wetting phase parameter γ shown in fig 5 then we calculate the soil moisture change by plugging the sampled γ into eq 2 while the initial soil moisture sm i is already calculated either from the final value of a dry down or soil moisture of the previous time step of a wetting we repeat this procedure until rainfall ends we use hourly mrms rainfall at each hillslope by calculating the area weighted average rainfall of the contributing mrms pixels the initial soil moisture of the hillslopes on april 1st 2016 were generated randomly with a uniform distribution ranging from residual saturation to soil porosity simulations are conducted for each basin separately with their corresponding calculated parameters we note that turkey river and south fork basins have approximately 10 800 and 1800 hillslopes respectively fig 6 shows a schematic of one smap pixel intersecting mrms rainfall grid and hillslopes each smap grid consists of approximately 100 mrms grids and more than 300 hillslopes normalized soil moisture standard deviation and skewness are compared with its mean for model and sensor observations also these three statistics are calculated for smap soil moisture and upscaled model soil moisture over turkey river basin for upscaling the model soil moisture to smap pixel resolution spatial mean of normalized model soil moisture is calculated for hillslopes that are within smap pixel thereafter upscaled model soil moisture time series is subset over time by using the matching timestamps of smap satellite overpass the differences in spatial variability of absolute soil moisture and normalized soil moisture degree of saturation is shown by brocca et al 2014 hence for spatial statistics mean standard deviation and skewness of sensor observations model and smap soil moisture we used normalized soil moisture or effective saturation defined as 3 θ sm sm r ϕ sm r where θ is normalized soil moisture degree of saturation that changes from 0 to 1 sm is volumetric water content that can change between residual soil moisture sm r and soil porosity ϕ for sensor observations we used minimum and maximum soil moisture of the sensor history as porosity and residual soil moisture respectively for normalization of model soil moisture and smap soil moisture we used polaris soil porosity and residual soil moisture for the sake of completeness definitions of mean standard deviation and skewness are given in eqs 4 6 4 e θ 1 n i 1 n θ i 5 σ θ i 1 n θ i e θ 6 g θ 1 n i 1 n θ i e θ 3 σ θ 3 where n is the number of hillslopes θ i is normalized soil moisture at i th hillslope and e θ is the mean soil moisture of the hillslopes it is important to highlight that the independence of point scale model parameters does not imply independence of the time series that are generated a strong correlation between sites is maintained because spatial patterns of precipitation are correlated 3 results and discussions 3 1 smap sub grid soil moisture soil moisture estimates for one smap pixel inside turkey river and south fork basins are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively we selected smap pixels that contain at least one soil moisture sensor which are highlighted with red color in these figures longitude and latitude of the centroid for smap pixel in turkey river basin and south fork are 91 4680 42 7813 and 93 4537 42 4914 decimal degrees respectively the top panel shows hourly mrms rainfall averaged over hillslopes within one smap pixel the color scale shows the soil moisture probability of occurrence p sm inside the smap grid for april november 2016 descending and ascending swaths of the smap satellite are shown with downward and upward triangles also time series of soil moisture sensor s collocated with smap pixel is shown in black line for smap pixels within each basin soil moisture from smap and in situ stations were inside the range of modeled soil moisture higher rainfall magnitudes tended to increase the probability of higher soil moisture within smap pixel from model overall smap soil moisture wettings and dry downs agreed with the model and sensor however generally smap soil moisture estimations are lower than other two more specifically smap soil moisture is drier than sensor and model soil moisture from june to september 3 2 basin scale soil moisture figs 9 and 10 from top to bottom panel show basin averaged hourly rainfall from the mrms product simulated soil moisture probability of occurrence over time with median soil moisture of all of the hillslopes within each basin red line the corresponding smap soil moisture as box plots with dark and light gray colors referring to am and pm swaths of smap satellite and time series of soil moisture observations inside each basin the maximum number of sensors used for turkey river basin and south fork are 15 and 16 respectively there was good agreement between sensor observations and simulated time series of soil moisture where sensor observations are within the range of simulated soil moisture for the two basins in few cases specifically for south fork sensor observations exceeded the saturation level of the model that could be originating from either flow accumulation at soil moisture sensor location or lower soil porosity used in the model smap soil moisture observations lie inside the simulated range however there are moments in time where smap estimations are lower than residual saturation more specifically smap soil moisture for south fork basin exhibited lower soil moisture values than the residual saturation for june august 2016 this could be due to the vegetation growing season in iowa where l band radiometric sensitivity to vegetation water content vwc increases that conversely decreases sensitivity to soil moisture neelam and mohanty 2015 spatial variability of smap soil moisture for south fork was less than turkey river due to the smaller watershed area and thus fewer smap pixels smap soil moisture estimates tend to dry down faster than estimated soil moisture of the hillslopes which is consistent with the study on the smap moisture dry down rates shellito et al 2016 and an overall assessment of smap soil moisture products chan et al 2016 chen et al 2018 speculated that underestimation in auxiliary surface temperature of smap could be one of the contributors to dry bias of smap soil moisture estimates 3 3 standard deviation and skewness hourly standard deviation with respect to mean of normalized model and observed soil moisture for turkey river and south fork are shown in fig 11 standard deviation is maximum in the intermediate range of soil moisture while it is lower for low and high soil moisture mean values the overall trend and dynamic range for the mean and standard deviation of observed soil moisture is captured by the model for turkey river basin the standard deviation of the modeled and observed soil moisture for wet conditions was lower than dry conditions while for south fork basin the lower limits of standard deviation for wet and dry conditions had similar values for the time period of our study maximum standard deviation of observed soil moisture for turkey river basin fig 11a is 0 29 cm 3 cm 3 with mean value of 0 54 cm 3 cm 3 whereas the peak standard deviation of observations for south fork fig 11b is approximately 0 30 cm 3 cm 3 at mean soil moisture of 0 35 cm 3 cm 3 soil moisture variability results by gebler et al 2017 using hydrologic model were lower than the observed soil moisture spatial variability because of uniform atmospheric forcing e g rainfall and vegetation over their study domain modeled soil moisture variability results from cornelissen et al 2014 also showed an underestimation compared to observations due to homogeneous rainfall forcing in contrast to these two studies our model results for soil moisture variability are slightly higher than observations which can be attributed to rainfall variability in space fig 12 shows changes of skewness with mean soil moisture for turkey river and south fork basins respectively soil moisture skewness of the model and observations show good agreement for both watersheds the distribution is negatively skewed for wet conditions while skewness becomes positive for dry conditions this result is in the same line with conclusions by famiglietti et al 2008 while general patterns of standard deviation and skewness with respect to mean are captured by the proposed model there are differences in modeled and observed normalized soil moisture statistics with respect to its mean one reason for this difference could be due to normalization of observations by using maximum and minimum of the soil moisture sensor history as porosity and residual soil moisture note that the number of hillslopes sample size for which the statistics are calculated in figs 11 and 12 is not same as the number of sensor observations in these basins therefore for comparisons between observed and modeled soil moisture standard deviation and skewness same number of hillslopes as the number of sensor observations was selected randomly inside each basin and statistics were calculated for each group accordingly figs 13 and 14 correspond to standard deviation and skewness of normalized soil moisture with respect to its mean these two figures show the statistics for groups of 15 and 16 hillslopes for turkey river and south fork basins dynamic range of the statistics in these two figures cover the standard deviation and skewness of the soil moisture sensor observations within each basin in contrast to south fork basin modeled soil moisture standard deviations reach zero for very wet conditions in turkey river basin because of high rainfall spatial extent the range of observed soil moisture skewness for turkey river basin and south fork are within the range of ensemble skewness of the model turkey river basin is 6 times larger than south fork therefore the range for soil moisture standard deviation and skewness is higher for a given mean previous studies such as andrew and günter 1999 and famiglietti et al 2008 have shown that as spatial extent increases soil moisture standard deviation increases our results show that normalized soil moisture standard deviation is maximum at intermediate range θ 0 5 these results are consistent with the findings from previous studies e g famiglietti et al 1998 choi and jacobs 2007 famiglietti et al 2008 rosenbaum et al 2012 cho and choi 2014 where the relationship between standard deviation of soil moisture with its mean was found to be downward concave upward convex we note that upper bound of variance for a bounded random variable follows bhatia davis inequality bhatia and davis 2000 7 σ 2 θ m e θ e θ m where θ is normalized soil moisture that is bounded between m 1 and m 0 the maximum possible variance is 0 25 that corresponds to e θ 0 5 while variance is zero at the two bounds therefore the upward convex relationship between mean and standard deviation variance of normalized soil moisture is its inherent statistical property we further compare the variations of normalized soil moisture statistics over time using the same approach described previously for generating results shown in figs 13 and 14 fig 15 shows model approximations for upper and lower bounds of soil moisture standard deviation and skewness over time for turkey river and south fork basins soil moisture variability and skewness decreases for rainfall events with high spatial extent temporal variations of standard deviation and skewness for observations and model generally have good agreement as previously shown in fig 10 the observed sensor soil moisture values are within the range of modeled soil moisture over time while there are few instances in time where standard deviation of the observations is slightly lower than that of approximated possible standard deviations for south fork basin fig 15c note that as it is discussed by chaney et al 2015 lack of soil moisture sensors in wet regions will lead to underestimation in standard deviation compared to model estimations specially over dry periods 3 4 spatial variability and skewness of smap soil moisture spatial statistics of upscaled model and smap satellite soil moisture over turkey river basin are also calculated fig 16 shows standard deviation and skewness of smap soil moisture and upscaled model soil moisture over turkey river basin for 65 pixels whereas each pixel covers at least 20 hillslopes upward and downward triangles in this figure correspond to ascending pm and descending am smap satellite orbits respectively the standard deviation and skewness of upscaled model soil moisture and smap satellite soil moisture over turkey river basin are in a similar dynamic ranges however the mean values of smap satellite soil moisture are generally lower than mean of upscaled model soil moisture compared to spatial variability of soil moisture in basin scale which is shown in fig 11a fig 16a suggests that standard deviation of upscaled model is lower due to averaging of hillslope soil moisture over smap pixels that has approximate support length of 9 km this result is consistent with findings from andrew and günter 1999 and zarlenga et al 2018 that showed increasing support length decreases soil moisture spatial variance fig 16b shows skewness for upscaled model and smap soil moisture over turkey river basin there is similar trend as shown in fig 12a whereas skewness is negative for wet and becomes positive in dry conditions for smap and upscaled model as previously mentioned we averaged the soil moisture of the hillslopes collocated with a given smap pixel although averaging as an upscaling approach shows comparable results in terms of soil moisture variability however as njoku and entekhabi 1996 suggested due to horizontal heterogeneities within satellite footprint the retrieved average soil moisture of satellite remote sensing in most of the cases may not be representative of the spatial average of soil moisture further studies on this aspect using data from field campaigns such as smapvex campaigns can help in understanding the spatial aggregation scheme of the satellite 4 summary conclusions in this study we focused on the parameterization of dry down and wetting phases of surface soil moisture and extraction of the parameter distributions for each phase using 31 rainfall and soil moisture measurements over two basins we used the extracted statistical information from soil moisture sensors and we simulated surface soil moisture at each hillslope by bringing higher resolution information on soil properties and rainfall we compared observed modeled and smap satellite soil moisture estimates over the study period furthermore we investigated sub grid and basin scale soil moisture variability taking all the above mentioned points into consideration the following conclusions can be drawn smap soil moisture responded to rainfall events while generally it increased less than observed and modeled soil moisture for the study period in most of the cases smap underestimated soil moisture during dry down periods there were only few cases where smap soil moisture was slightly higher than observed and modeled soil moisture satellite soil moisture retrievals are sensitive to vwc vegetation water content smap uses a 10 year 2000 2010 climatological average for vwc which is derived from modis kim 2013 smap estimates for turkey river basin were slightly higher than south fork part of this could be due to less cropland proportion in turkey river basin 56 compared to south fork 88 field observations of soil moisture for the two basins corresponded very well with the modeled soil moisture where they lie inside the range of simulated soil moisture for 2016 moreover standard deviation and skewness of the two watersheds exhibited different behaviors from each other originating from different soil properties and wetness which was captured by the proposed model thus demonstrating the model skill in replicating the soil moisture statistics in theory for two extreme cases of very wet and dry conditions with large spatial extent over the basins the distribution of soil moisture for a given basin should approach to distributions of soil porosity and residual soil moisture over the study area our results indicate that for dry wet and medium soil moisture conditions soil moisture skewness become positive negative and close to zero respectively which is consistent with findings from previous studies e g cho and choi 2014 famiglietti et al 1997 we show that as the number of hillslopes samples for which the statistics are calculated increases for a given mean soil moisture uncertainty in standard deviation and skewness decreases spatial variability and skewness of the upscaled model soil moisture is found to be comparable with smap soil moisture over turkey river basin suggesting that averaging over larger support length decreases variability the relationship between soil moisture variability with its mean from soil moisture sensors and the proposed model implies that uncertainty in soil moisture for two cases of wet and dry conditions decreases to values close to zero this relationship could be used as an insight for inferring the information content of the satellite soil moisture estimations and its applications we have compared our results with satellite soil moisture in terms of spatial variability in basin scale and in probabilistic sense for sub grid scale further research is needed for connecting the information content of satellite estimations to field scale or hillslope scale soil moisture while analysis of data from field campaigns could be helpful with this respect in this study we only addressed the surface soil moisture dynamics which is more relevant to satellite soil moisture our methodology could be used in basins that have soil moisture observations such as international soil moisture networks dorigo et al 2011 and ground based radar rainfall zhang et al 2016 harrison et al 2009 or satellite rainfall products e g huffman et al 2015 for estimating basin scale or satellite soil moisture sub grid variability the main limitation of our study is that its application depends on availability of recent historical soil moisture sensor rain gauge data for analysis and fine resolution radar rainfall data for simulations future studies developed by this methodology could account for longer time periods the errors in radar rainfall and uncertainty in soil properties for more accurate depiction of basin and sub grid soil moisture distributions also our study demonstrated the importance of field observations for further understanding of the surface soil moisture variability this methodology could be expanded to lower soil layers by extracting statistical information from soil moisture observations at each depth and coupling between them for partitioning of rainfall to runoff and more specifically drought and flood forecasting credit authorship contribution statement navid
