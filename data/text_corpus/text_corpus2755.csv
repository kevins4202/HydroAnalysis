13775,the effectiveness of bank filtration bf is highly dependent on the source water quality e g organic matter composition ph and concentration of heavy metals hms in this study the impact of dissolved organic matter dom on the removal of selected metals cu zn pb se and ni during bf was investigated column studies were conducted at 30 c with feed water sources of different organic matter composition excitation emission matrix fluorescence coupled with parallel factor analysis parafac eem was used to characterise the organic composition of the feed waters moreover another series of column studies was conducted to assess the impact of natural organic matter type humic protein and concentration on the hms removals the experimental results revealed a high pb ii removal efficiency during filtration which depends only slightly on the organic matter content of the feed water in comparison the removals of cu zn and ni ranged between 65 and 95 and relied significantly on the organic concentration and composition in the raw waters humic compounds terrestrial or microbial demonstrated adequate ability to reduce the removal efficiencies of these hms during the infiltration conversely biodegradable matter was found to be effective in enhancing the sorption of hms onto the sand grains the se removal was enhanced when the feed water contained a higher concentration of biodegradable matter in general it can be concluded that the organic composition of the source water affects profoundly the removal of hms during the bf and should be considered in the design of bf systems keywords bank filtration dissolved organic matter heavy metals parafac eem 1 introduction bank filtration bf is a natural and economical water treatment technology which can be applied worldwide provided that the hydrogeological conditions and quality of the regarding river or lake are satisfactory 1 2 the technique involves induced infiltration of the river lake water towards the production well situated at some distance from the river lake the subsurface sediments act as natural filters that are capable of removing different types of contaminants from the river lake water 3 this technology has been implemented in europe for more than 100 years and recently the application of bf has extended into many developing countries worldwide compared to surface water treatment bf is considered one of the most cost effective known technology that can be effectively applied due to its simplified design lower operation and maintenance and costs bf is known as an efficient technique to remove the pollutants from source water and supplying high drinking water quality 4 5 bf can remove different contaminants including organic micro pollutants microbial pathogens nutrients and heavy metals hms 6 7 hms are widely distributed in the earth s crust and are naturally non biodegradable metals such as mercury hg cadmium cd arsenic as chromium cr thallium tl zinc zn nickel ni copper cu selenium se and lead pb are commonly found in surface waters a small number of hms in trace amounts have an essential role in the metabolism of humans and animals however higher concentrations may be toxic hms constitute a significant public health concern because of their bio accumulative nature in biotic systems and must therefore be removed from drinking water 8 excess exposure to pb causes irreversible brain damage and encephalopathy symptoms drinking water with high levels of cu may cause nausea vomiting stomach cramps and sometimes diarrhoea 9 in addition se amounts above the maximal contaminant level can cause numbness in the extremities circulation problems neurological impairment and fingernail or hair loss high levels of zn in drinking water may cause stomach cramps vomiting and sometimes nausea 8 moreover a high concentration of ni can damage the dna of the hands 10 the removal of hms during bf is highly dependent on the site conditions source water quality matrix and hm type various studies have been conducted to investigate the biogeochemical processes taking place during the infiltration of river water into alluvial aquifers and its impacts on the removal of hms 11 12 these studies highlight that the adsorption of hms during the filtration process is considerably impacted by the water quality matrix of the raw water more specifically the ph dissolved oxygen and dissolved organic matter dom dom contains multiple functional groups that have an affinity for hms and hence may affect the mobility of hms in aquatic and soil systems during the bf process 13 the interaction of dom and hms in surface water occurs in different ways 13 dom in surface water forms complexes after reaction with hms which reduces the bioavailability and toxicity of hms to aquatic organisms 10 the type of dom such as humic substances fulvic acid and humic acid influences the geochemical mobility of metal ions during the infiltration processes 13 according to reuteret al 14 metal humic complexes in natural water systems have a higher stability than inorganic metal compounds hence the presence of dom affects the variation in the behaviour of metal pollutants in natural water systems the risk of contaminated drinking water due to hms is increasing in particular in developing countries where industrial and human activities result in the discharge of waste with high organic concentration into water bodies 10 in a previous study 15 the authors discussed the behaviour of dom fractions during the bf process however the effect of dom on heavy metal removal during bf processes is not well understood in addition hardly any studies to elucidate the impact of dom fractions humic fulvic and protein on the behaviour of hms during the bf process had been carried out hence the main objective of this research was to study the behaviours of heavy metals during infiltration and extent to which these behaviours could be affected by the concentration and composition of organic matter in the source water especially in hot climate regions this is a prerequisite step towards the successful application of bf in arid climate countries therefore laboratory scale column studies were conducted at a controlled room temperature 30 c to investigate the effect of the feed water source and natural organic matter nom type humic like protein like tyrosine the combination of protein like and humic acid on the removal of hms cu zn ni pb and se during the infiltration process 2 materials and methods 2 1 filter media characteristics the silica sand grain size 0 8 1 25 mm used in this study was bought from wildkamp company netherlands the characteristics of the sand is presented in table s1 the media was washed with non chlorinated tap water to discard the debris before introducing into the columns the average bulk density and porosity of sand were 1500 kg m3 and 0 42 respectively the organic content and the hms concentrations of the sand were determined using the acid extraction method described in 16 the biological activity associated with the saturated sand was estimated in terms of adenosine triphosphate atp following the technique described in previous studies 15 17 2 2 column experiment 2 2 1 experimental set up laboratory scale soil column setup was used to assess the impact of organic matter on the removal of hms during the filtration process the pvc pipes with an internal diameter of 4 2 cm and a total height of 50 cm were used for all experiment all pipes were fitted with a stopper leaving a space of 5 cm at the top and 5 cm for supporting materials saturated gravels at the bottom natural silica sand with a grain size ranging between 0 7 and 1 25 mm was filled up on top of the gravel for about 40 cm in all columns then the column was fitted with connectors from both ends to fix the influent and effluent tube the tube was connected to the influent tank of about 10 l by using a polyethylene tube the influents and effluents tubes were replaced after every five days and also covered with black materials and foils to reduce biofilm formation during the experimental process the influent container was cleaned with diluted hcl and washed several times with distilled water before introducing the feedwater into the tank aeration was executed by inducing air tubes connected from the oxygen gas diffuser into the feed water tanks the dissolved oxygen do was monitored continuously to ensure the oxygen supplied is enough to support the experimental condition do 7 mg l to introduce the feedwater from the tank into the column at the desirable hydraulic load rate a variable speed peristaltic pump was attached to the bottom of the column the experiment was implemented at a controlled temperature room 30 c to assure the possibility of removing hms during bf in hot climate areas different parameters were monitored periodically to ensure that the experiments were conducted under the desired conditions such parameters include the dissolved oxygen ph of the influent infiltration rate and the concentration of hms in the feed water 2 2 2 effect of dom composition of raw water on hm removal during bf four pvc columns were fed with different types of source waters to investigate the effect of the feed water organic matter composition on the removal of hms therefore four types of feed water were prepared from different sources including i non chlorinated tap water nctw with a low organic content ii delft canal dc water collected from a canal iii secondary treated wastewater obtained from the harnaschpolder wwtp and mixed with delft canal water to simulate contaminated surface water systems dcww and iv water containing extractable organic matter weom which contains higher concentrations of humic compounds which was prepared following the method proposed by guigueet al 18 the physical chemical water quality parameters of all feed waters were analysed before the start of the experiment table 1 the ph of the feed waters was adjusted to 7 8 1 using naoh solution the column was run in the up flow mode and the empty bed contact time was 12 h 2 2 3 effect of nom type on hm removal during bf this experiment was principally conducted to investigate the impact of the nom type and concentration on the hm removal efficiency during a bf therefore four columns were developed and ripened at 30 c and hydraulic rate of 0 3 m day the first column was fed with nctw and used as a control sample the other columns were fed with mixtures of nctw and different nom types i humic ha ii ty and iii a mixture of 50 ha and 50 ty ha ty each type of nom was injected at four different concentrations 5 10 15 and 20 mg c l the experiments were conducted for each concentration and samples from the influent and effluent were taken daily 2 2 4 effect of nom type on specific hm removal efficiency the main target of this experiment was to analyse the impact of nom type on the removal efficiency of specific hm s during saturated infiltration and to assess whether the presence of multiple metals in the feed water can affect the adsorption characteristics of other hm s and their behaviours toward the organic matter fractions therefore eight columns were prepared and ripened for two months subsequently the columns were fed with nctw containing different nom types cu ii and se iv were spiked individually into the feed water of the four columns and the experiment took seven days at each hydraulic rate the thomas model was used to estimate the breakthrough of the metals and impact of the nom type on the adsorption parameters adsorption capacity and rate of the tested metals during the filtration process this kinetic model assumes that adsorption is governed by the mass transfer and chemical reaction processes and this reaction is a reversible second order reaction which obeys the langmuir adsorption kinetics thomas model in the linear form is described as follows eq 1 19 1 ln c 0 c t 1 k t h q 0 x q k t h c 0 t k t h is thomas adsorption rate constant l hr μg q 0 is the adsorption capacity μg g x is the mass of adsorbent g q is the flow rate of the feed water l hr c0 and ct are the initial and breakthrough concentration μg l 2 3 analytical methods samples were collected from both influent and effluent of the columns and filtered using 0 45 μm filtration whatman dassel germany the samples collected were acidified with 0 5 ml of concentrated hcl and stored at a controlled temperature room 4 c the metal cu zn ni and pb concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry xseries ii thermo scientific the limit of detection lod of metals was 10 μg l the se concentration was quantified with a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer solaar mqze gf95 thermo electron co where the lod was 5 μg l the combustion technique was employed to determine the organic content doc in mg c l of the influent and effluent samples using a total organic carbon analyser toc vcpn tn shimadzu japan lod 20 mg l specific ultraviolet absorbance suva254 l mg 1 m 1 was estimated to define the aromaticity of the influent and effluent suva254 was calculated as a ratio between the dom of the water sample and its ultraviolet absorbance uv at 254 nm m 1 the uv absorbance was determined using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2501pc shimadzu the organic constituents of the samples were determined with the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem technique fluoromax 3 spectrofluorometer horiba jobin yvon edison the fluorescence intensity of the samples was determined at the excitation wavelengths λex 240 452 nm with 4 nm intervals and at the emission wavelengths λem 290 500 nm with 2 nm intervals the fluorescence indices including the humification index hix fluorescence index fix and biological index bix were used to characterise the organic fluorescence characteristics of the feed water these indices were described in details by gaboret al 20 hix is an indicator of the humification degree of the feed water and estimated as follows 21 2 h

estimated following eq 3 20 and it varies between 1 2 1 8 with lower values refer to dom of terrestrial origin 3 f i x f i λ e m 450 f i λ e m 500 a t λ e x 370 n m bix was used to estimate the contribution of microbial dom to the total organic content of the feed water this parameter was determined using eq 4 22 4 b i x f i λ e m 380 f i λ e m 430 a t λ e x 310 n m 2 4 fluorescence modelling the fluorescence eem spectroscopy was combined with the parallel factor analysis parafac algorithm to discretise the fluorescence dataset into independent fluorescence components this technique has been widely used to identify organic matter characteristics of surface and subsurface water systems 15 23 the parafac technique uses an alternating least squares algorithm to separate the fluorescence dataset into independent fluorescence components with different dissolved organic fractions and a residual error term eq 5 24 5 x i j k f 1 f a i f b j f c k f ε i j k i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k f 1 f where x i j k is the fluorescence intensity of the ith sample at the kth excitation and jth emission wavelength f represents the number of fluorescence components a i f is the score of each f th component and relates to the fluorophore f concentration in sample i b j f is the scaled estimates loading of the emission spectrum of the f th fluorescence component c k f links to the excitation spectrum of the f th fluorescence component and expressed as loading and ε i j k is the residual term representing the unaccounted variation of the model a fluorescence dataset of 80 samples collected from the feed water was used to develop and validate the parafac models following the steps proposed by murphyet al 24 briefly an initial exploratory examination was first implemented to identify the poor quality measured data outliers and removed them from the dataset the outliers samples or variables are commonly produced due to sampling or measuring errors and are determined by conducting the leverage analysis the leverage value ranges between zero and one and expresses the deviation of measurement from the average data distribution then models with different components 3 7 proceeded and tested using different diagnostics techniques including split half validation the randomness of residuals and core consistency 24 2 5 data analysis the two way analysis of variance anova and post hoc tukey test were used to assess the significance of the impact of organic composition of the feed water and nom type on the removal of hms during the column filtration process the impact was considered significant if the level of significance p was below or equal to 0 05 in addition a spearman rank correlation ρ analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between the fluorescence characteristics of the feed water and the hm removal during the filtration process the strength of the relationship was considered high if the correlation value ρ 0 7 moderate if 0 4 ρ 0 7 and low if ρ 0 4 25 3 results 3 1 impact of feed water source on hm removal efficiency the effect of the organic composition of the feed water on the hm removal efficiency was studied with laboratory scale columns and different water sources spiked with various concentrations of hms the experiments were conducted at different hydraulic rates 0 3 0 6 and 1 0 m day 3 1 1 organic characteristics of feed water the results table 2 infer that nctw had the lowest concentration of organic matter its value ranged between 3 47 and 3 67 mg c l this feed water also showed had low suva 1 76 0 14 l mg g and hix 0 49 values which indicates its aliphatic organic composition the doc of the dc water 11 25 0 81 mg l and dcww 11 41 0 59 mg l were significantly higher than that of the weom feed water 9 7 0 24 mg l however the weom contained a higher concentration of aromatic compounds than the dc water and dcww the average suva values of the dc water dcww and weom were 2 99 0 11 3 72 0 39 and 3 82 0 27 l mg g respectively these results were confirmed by the fluorescence indices which revealed that the weom had a higher humic concentration hix 0 84 and fewer microbial derived compounds bix 0 54 than the dc water hix 0 8 bix 0 72 and dcww hix 0 74 bix 0 79 moreover the fix of the weom was evidently lower than that of the other feed waters suggesting that its humic content originated mainly from terrestrial sources 3 1 2 effect of organic composition of feed water on hm removal efficiency the results showed that pb ii had the highest capability to be removed during the filtration process the effluent concentration of pb ii in all columns was below the detection limit 5 μg l of the instrument under all experimental conditions however cu ii zn ii and ni ii exhibited lower removal efficiencies 65 95 these removal efficiencies were highly dependent p 0 05 on the organic concentration and composition of the feed water with a preferential removal at a low organic concentration fig 1 the removal efficiencies of cu ii ni ii and zn ii for dc feed water were 88 1 88 6 90 2 for the dcww 66 4 75 9 70 3 for the weom 79 1 85 3 87 4 and for the nctw 98 1 93 3 97 1 at a hydraulic loading rate of 1 0 m day these removal efficiencies changed by 1 16 at lower hydraulic rates 0 6 and 0 3 m day figs s1 and s2 therefore the hydraulic loading rate had no significant effect p 0 2 0 47 on the hm removal efficiencies cu ii zn ii ni ii during the filtration process nevertheless se iv was the most persistent metal to be removed during the filtration process the removal efficiency of se iv depended highly on the feed water organic composition p 0 001 the average removal efficiencies of se iv for the columns fed with dc water dcww weom and nctw were 23 5 25 5 7 4 and 4 2 at a hydraulic loading rate of 1 0 m day respectively moreover the statistical analysis revealed that the infiltration rate had no significant effect p 0 2 on the se iv removal efficiency the se iv removal efficiency in this study was linked to the biological activity associated with the sand the atp concentrations of the sand media of the columns fed with dcww dc water weom and nctw were 9 3 1 28 9 2 1 04 5 1 0 33 and 3 3 0 47 μg g respectively furthermore the correlation between se iv removal efficiency and atp concentration was 0 96 3 2 impact of fluorescence organic compounds on hm removal 3 2 1 fluorescence modelling the parafac eem model decomposed successfully the fluorescence data collected from the influents of the columns into three main components representing different organic composition groups the contour plots and loadings of the identified fluorescence components are presented in fig 2 the openfluor database which employs tucker s congruence coefficient to determine the similarity degree between the components was used to identify the separated parafac components and matched them to those recognised at the same excitation and emission wavelengths in the previous studies table s2 the first component pc1 exhibited maximal excitation wavelengths λex at 240 and 344 nm and maximal emission wavelengths λem at 474 nm hence this component probably corresponded to humic compounds derived from terrestrial sources 26 component 2 pc2 exhibited two maxima λex at 240 and 300 nm and a single maximum λem at 396 nm this component matched well with humic compounds originating from microbial sources 23 component 3 pc3 exhibited two maxima λex at 240 and 272 nm and a maximum λem at 316 nm this component resembled protein like fluorophores originating from microbial sources 15 the results table 2 refers that weom and dcww feed water has the highest content of terrestrial and microbial humic compounds respectively whereas nctw retained with the lowest concentration of the three organic fluorescence compounds 3 2 2 relationship between dom fluorescence composition and hm removal efficiency the correlations between hm removal efficiency and organic fluorescence characteristics of the feed waters are presented in fig 3 the results demonstrate that the organic matter concentration and fluorescence composition of the feed water had a significant impact on the hm behaviour during the filtration process pb ii was impacted least by the variations in the organic concentration of the feed water the correlation between the pb ii removal efficiency and organic matter concentration was ρ 0 21 conversely dom suppressed the removal efficiencies of cu ii ni ii and zn ii in the sand surface and negative relationships between the removal efficiencies of these metals and organic concentration of the feed water were observed the fluorescence indices results revealed that the humic content of the feed water affected negatively the adsorption of cu ii zn ii and ni ii and negative correlations between the removal efficiency of the previously mentioned metals and fluorescence characteristics hix bix and fix of the feed water were observed cu ii was more affected by the changes in the humic content of the feed water than ni ii and zn ii the correlations between cu ii ni ii and zn ii removal efficiencies and hix of the feed water were 0 63 0 53 and 0 36 respectively the parafac data revealed that the terrestrial humic and microbial humic substances were highly correlated with the removal efficiencies of cu ii ni ii and zn ii thus the humic compounds regardless of their structures can react with the three metals and reduce their adsorption efficiencies in contrast organic matter enhanced the removal efficiency of se iv during the filtration process a strong positive correlation was detected between the se iv removal efficiency and the organic concentration of the feed water the fluorescence data revealed that the se iv removal efficiency depended weakly on the level of humic compounds in the feed water in addition a weak correlation ρ 0 33 was detected between the se iv removal efficiency and hix of the feed water however the bix ρ 0 69 and fix ρ 0 57 exhibited a good correlation the se iv removal efficiency correlated well with the fluorescence intensity of the protein like ρ 0 72 and microbial humic compounds ρ 0 58 in conclusion the se iv removal efficiency showed a stronger correlation to the biodegradable matter concentration of the feed water during the filtration process 3 3 impact of nom on hm removal efficiency the laboratory scale column experiments were conducted to investigate thoroughly the effect of organic matter on hms removal efficiency during filtration with different noms ha ty and a mixture of ha ty at different concentrations 5 10 15 20 mg l in the feed water the fluorescence characteristics of the feed water are presented in fig s3 3 3 1 effect of nom type and concentration on hm removal efficiency the type and concentration of the nom had a significant influence on the hm removal efficiency during the filtration process fig 4 the removal efficiency of pb ii exceeded 90 in the presence of ty the post hoc tests tukey method showed that there were no statistically significant differences in the removal efficiencies of pb ii in feed water containing different concentrations of ty or a mixture of ha and ty this indicates the dominate role of labile organic compounds ty in enhancing the removal efficiency of pb ii during the filtration process however regarding the column fed with ha the pb ii removal efficiency exhibited a gradual decrease with increasing ha concentration in the feed water the pb ii removal efficiencies were 97 0 12 93 1 5 86 2 5 and 73 3 for humic concentrations of 5 10 15 and 20 mg c l in the feed water respectively this implies that the highly concentrated ha compounds 5 mg c l possessed sufficient capacity to suppress the adsorption of pb ii onto the sand surface the nom type affected significantly the removal efficiencies of cu ii ni ii and zn ii during the filtration process with a preferential removal in the presence of ty however no significant difference in the removal efficiencies of these metals was observed for the columns fed with different concentrations of ty because their removal efficiencies all exceeded 90 by contrast the ha compounds deteriorated the adsorption efficiencies of these metals during the filtration process the removal efficiencies of cu ii zn ii and ni ii were 85 5 91 2 and 96 0 6 for the column fed with 5 mg c l ha respectively as these removal efficiencies decreased to 19 8 66 5 and 68 5 for a ha concentration of 20 mg c l in the feed water respectively cu ii was most influenced by the increasing ha concentration the same trend was observed for the column which was fed with nctw spiked with an ha ty mixture whereby the removal efficiencies of cu ii ni ii and zn ii decreased by 45 18 and 12 when the feed mixture concentration increased by 15 mg l respectively thus humic compounds had a higher capacity than the ty compounds to suppress the adsorption efficiencies of cu ii ni ii and zn ii on a sand surface se iv removal efficiency depended highly on the type and concentration of nom in the feed water during filtration process the column fed with a mixture of ha and ty exhibited the highest se iv removal capacity during the filtration however the post hoc results revealed that there were no significant differences in the removal efficiencies of se iv between the columns fed with ty and ha ty on the other hand se iv exhibited a higher removal persistence in the absence of ty the removal efficiency of se iv was 16 3 for the column fed with 10 mg c l ha this removal efficiency decreased to 13 2 and 12 1 in the feed water with 15 and 20 mg c l ha respectively therefore it can be deduced that biodegradable compounds are feasible for the se iv removal in filtration processes 3 3 2 kinetic study of cu ii and se iv in infiltration process among the tested metals cu ii and se iv were most impacted by the varying nom types and concentrations during the filtration process therefore laboratory scale column studies were conducted to determine the adsorption kinetics of these two metals under different experimental conditions and the impact of the presence of other metals this set of experiments was conducted under the same experimental conditions however a fixed concentration of each metal was individually injected into the nctw feed water spiked with different nom types ha ty ha ty furthermore the thomas model was used to describe the breakthrough curves fig s4 and estimate the adsorption parameters adsorption capacity and rate of cu ii and se iv during the filtration process tables 3 and 4 the results show that the experimental data and model agreed well high r2 and low x2 according to table 3 the adsorption behaviour of cu ii in the columns fed with different nom compositions exhibited evident differences ty had a positive effect on the adsorption characteristics of cu ii during the filtration process in addition the breakthrough time of cu ii was longer for the column fed with nctw and ty than for the control column fed with only nctw based on the thomas model the adsorption capacity of cu ii increased from 2 01 2 89 μg g when 10 mg c l ty was added to the feed water by contrast ha compounds had a negative effect on the adsorption capacity of cu ii its value decreased to 0 53 and 1 01 μg g when ha and ha ty were added to the nctw feed water respectively furthermore the kinetic results revealed that the presence of other metals in the raw water reduced the effect of humic compounds on the adsorption of cu and increased the adsorption capacity of the sand the adsorption capacities were 2 83 and 1 9 μg g for the columns fed with ha and ha ty in the presence of other metals respectively however this effect was negligible for the columns supplied with nctw and ty regarding se iv table 4 the adsorption capacity of the sand was lower for the column fed with ha 0 003 μg g and higher for the column fed with ha ty 0 016 μg g and ty 0 024 μg g thus the biodegradable compounds ty appeared to promote the removal of se iv during the filtration process however the presence of other metals in the raw water had a negative effect on the adsorption characteristics of se iv during the filtration process the adsorption capacities of the sand decreased to 0 002 0 019 and 0 012 μg g for the columns fed with ha ty and ha ty respectively 4 discussion 4 1 removal of hms during bank filtration the pb ii removal efficiency was higher than other metals during filtration regardless of the surrounding environmental conditions more specifically the pb removal efficiency was above 90 under all experimental conditions different hydraulic rates and feed water organic compositions according to kalakodioet al 27 precipitation and adsorption are the main mechanisms which remove pb ii during the sand filtration process furthermore a phreeqc analysis was conducted in this study to determine the precipitation characteristics of the added pb ii based on the results its concentration in the feed water was insufficient for precipitation saturation index si 1 which implies that the removal of pb ii during the column experiment was mainly caused by adsorption several studies 28 30 highlighted that pb has a higher affinity to the organic matter and silicates groups at the surface of the soil than other metals sontheimer 31 reported an average pb ii removal efficiency of 75 at bf sites along the rhine river germany in this research the experiment was conducted at high temperature 30 2 c which considerably enhanced the adsorption characteristics of the metal during filtration awanet al 32 reported that pb ii has a high probability to become hydrolysed in water thus it can be readily chemisorbed on the sand the hydrolysis and adsorption processes were strongly enhanced by the increased temperature furthermore guanxinget al 33 highlighted that the adsorption of pb ii into the soil is an endothermic reaction and its efficiency is positively related to temperature the high pb ii removal capacity of a sand filtration process was also observed in column experiment conducted at 25 c 34 thus it can be concluded that the bf technique is capable of removing pb ii from source water in particular under hot climate conditions the removal efficiencies of cu ii zn ii and ni ii were lower 65 95 than that of pb ii during filtration and statistically independent of the flow rate of the feed water consequently the retention time did not play a significant role in the removal of these metals during the filtration process the efficiency of the bf technique in the removal of these metals under different hydrological and climate conditions has been investigated nagy kovácset al 3 reported removal efficiencies of 59 99 of these metals at bf sites along the danube river hungary awanet al 32 highlighted that the removal efficiencies of these metals are highly dependent on their affinity to negatively charge groups e g oh at the soil surface which depends strongly on the environmental conditions e g temperature ph and organic content of the raw water a high persistence of se iv was observed during the column filtration process the removal efficiency of se iv did not exceed 40 under all experimental conditions this removal efficiency was statistically independent of the infiltration rate of the raw water schmidtet al 35 reported a low se iv removal efficiency 15 at a bf site along the rhine river germany the lower se iv removal efficiency during the filtration process was mainly ascribed to its natural characteristics of a high solubility and low adsorption characteristics which was also reported by liet al 36 4 2 impact of organic matter on hm removal efficiency the organic composition of the feed water had a minor effect on the pb ii removal efficiency during filtration according to ahmedet al 37 organic compounds augment the pb ii removal efficiency by forming adsorbable complexes however this research study revealed that feed water with a higher ha concentration 15 mg c l might suppress the removal efficiency of pb ii by 20 likewise ha had a negative impact on the removal efficiencies of cu ii zn ii and ni ii during filtration the highest reduction in removal efficiency was observed when the weom higher terrestrial humic content and dcww higher microbial humic content feed water were used the experimental results showed that the addition of 20 mg c l ha compounds to the feed water reduced the removal efficiencies of cu ii zn ii and ni ii by 40 75 similarly the se iv removal efficiency decreased with increasing ha concentration in the feed water the lower removal efficiency of the former metals in the presence of a higher ha concentration was mainly caused by i the ability of organic matter to react with metals and to form aqueous complex compounds which increases the mobility of the metals and reduces their adsorption efficiencies in the sand surface 38 ii ha compounds have a high potential to accumulate on the sand surface which reduces its adsorption capacity 39 iii ha compounds contain active functional groups e g carboxylic phenol and catechol oh which may associate to the minerals on the sand surface and compete with metal for the adsorption sites 40 iv the ha compounds can change the soil structure by improving its aggregation and thereby reducing the number of adsorption sites 41 interestingly the fluorescence data demonstrated that the ha compounds regardless of their source microbial or terrestrial reacted with these metals and reduced their adsorption efficiency moreover ha compounds enhanced the desorption rates of the metals via chelating and exchange reaction processes tianet al 42 illustrated that the desorption rate of se iv increases by approximately 50 in the presence of hydrophobic ha compounds the hydrophilic compounds could release a low amount below 3 5 of the adsorbed se 43 the impact of ha compounds on the metal removal depends strongly on the properties of the metal and its adsorption mechanisms on the sand surface in this research study cu ii was most impacted by the variation in the ha concentration in the feed water however cu ii exhibited a higher removal efficiency than zn ii and ni ii in the column fed with low organic content feed water nctw the sorption of cu ii is predominately based on the formation of strong electrostatic and covalent bonds with negative functional groups e g organic matter on sand surface grains 39 by contrast zn ii and ni ii tend to remain on the surface through an electrostatic attraction process 39 therefore cu ii is expected to have a higher affinity than zn ii and ni ii for the functional groups on the sand grains during the filtration process however this affinity decreases with increasing humic concentration in the feed water hence cu ii prefers to react with soluble ha substances and to form aqueous complexes than to be adsorbed onto active organic sorption sites of the soil the zn ii and ni ii adsorption rates were also affected to a lower extent by the humic content of the feed water zhaoet al 38 pointed out that cu ii binds stronger to the active groups e g phenols oh amines nh2 and carboxyl cooh of microbial and terrestrial humic compounds than zn ii and ni ii by contrast the biodegradable protein like compounds enhanced the hm removal efficiency during filtration according to abdelradyet al 44 lmw organic compounds tend to be adsorbed faster onto the sand surface than high molecular weight hmw compounds during a filtration process therefore a metal with a higher affinity towards lmw compounds is more likely to be removed during filtration moreover biodegradable matter promotes biological activity associated with the sand and thus enhances the biosorption and accumulation of metal on its surface 45 in this study the sand column with a higher microbial activity higher atp concentration had a higher hm removal efficiency during the infiltration process moreover 5 mg c l ty was sufficient for optimising removal of hm cu zn ni and pb during the filtration however it worth to note that it might enhance the development of an anaerobic environment within the infiltration zone and consequently promote the reduction and releasing of metals into the bank filtrate 4 3 impact of metals on sorption of cu and se during bank filtration the conducted kinetic experiments revealed that the adsorption rate of cu ii increased significantly when the feed water contained a mixture of metals hence the existence of other metals in the feed water retarded presumably the formation rate of the aqueous cu ii ha complex by contrast the presence of other metals in the raw water had an adverse effect on the adsorption capacity of the sand for se iv during filtration a lower se iv removal efficiency impact even when the raw water contained lmw ty or hmw humic organic compounds dinhet al 46 pointed out that lmw organic compounds tend to react with metals and form stable ring complexes that compete with se iv for adsorption sites however hmw compounds can reduce the adsorption capacity of sand by accumulating and blocking adsorption sites or changing the sand structure as previously discussed therefore it can be concluded that good removal of se iv can be achieved with bf when the raw water has a low concentration of metals and high content of biodegradable organic matter 5 conclusions laboratory scale column experiments were conducted to assess the impact of the feed water and organic composition on the removal of hms cu zn ni pb and se during the bf process and the following conclusions are drawn pb is the most probable metal to be adsorbed into the sand surface during the filtration process however humic compounds at concentrations above 15 mg c l reduced the adsorption efficiency by approximately 20 in pure water cu zn and ni exhibited lower removal efficiency during the filtration process 70 95 for the column fed with different water sources furthermore the experimental results showed that 10 mg c l humic compounds could reduce the adsorption efficiencies of these metals by 40 75 se was the most persistent metal during the column filtration process among the tested metals its removal was less than 40 under all the experimental conditions biodegradable matter enhanced the adsorption rates of the aforementioned metals whereas humic compounds negatively affected their removal efficiencies parafac fluorescence data revealed that presence of both terrestrial and or microbial humic compounds reduced the adsorption efficiency of the metals the kinetic study revealed that the presence of other metals in the raw water reduced the influence of the humic compounds on the adsorption of cu and thus enhanced its removal efficiency conversely the presence of hms exhibited a negative effect on the removal of se during the filtration process therefore this study highlighted the impact of dissolved organic matter composition on the removal efficiencies of hms which should be considered in the design and installation of

13775,the effectiveness of bank filtration bf is highly dependent on the source water quality e g organic matter composition ph and concentration of heavy metals hms in this study the impact of dissolved organic matter dom on the removal of selected metals cu zn pb se and ni during bf was investigated column studies were conducted at 30 c with feed water sources of different organic matter composition excitation emission matrix fluorescence coupled with parallel factor analysis parafac eem was used to characterise the organic composition of the feed waters moreover another series of column studies was conducted to assess the impact of natural organic matter type humic protein and concentration on the hms removals the experimental results revealed a high pb ii removal efficiency during filtration which depends only slightly on the organic matter content of the feed water in comparison the removals of cu zn and ni ranged between 65 and 95 and relied significantly on the organic concentration and composition in the raw waters humic compounds terrestrial or microbial demonstrated adequate ability to reduce the removal efficiencies of these hms during the infiltration conversely biodegradable matter was found to be effective in enhancing the sorption of hms onto the sand grains the se removal was enhanced when the feed water contained a higher concentration of biodegradable matter in general it can be concluded that the organic composition of the source water affects profoundly the removal of hms during the bf and should be considered in the design of bf systems keywords bank filtration dissolved organic matter heavy metals parafac eem 1 introduction bank filtration bf is a natural and economical water treatment technology which can be applied worldwide provided that the hydrogeological conditions and quality of the regarding river or lake are satisfactory 1 2 the technique involves induced infiltration of the river lake water towards the production well situated at some distance from the river lake the subsurface sediments act as natural filters that are capable of removing different types of contaminants from the river lake water 3 this technology has been implemented in europe for more than 100 years and recently the application of bf has extended into many developing countries worldwide compared to surface water treatment bf is considered one of the most cost effective known technology that can be effectively applied due to its simplified design lower operation and maintenance and costs bf is known as an efficient technique to remove the pollutants from source water and supplying high drinking water quality 4 5 bf can remove different contaminants including organic micro pollutants microbial pathogens nutrients and heavy metals hms 6 7 hms are widely distributed in the earth s crust and are naturally non biodegradable metals such as mercury hg cadmium cd arsenic as chromium cr thallium tl zinc zn nickel ni copper cu selenium se and lead pb are commonly found in surface waters a small number of hms in trace amounts have an essential role in the metabolism of humans and animals however higher concentrations may be toxic hms constitute a significant public health concern because of their bio accumulative nature in biotic systems and must therefore be removed from drinking water 8 excess exposure to pb causes irreversible brain damage and encephalopathy symptoms drinking water with high levels of cu may cause nausea vomiting stomach cramps and sometimes diarrhoea 9 in addition se amounts above the maximal contaminant level can cause numbness in the extremities circulation problems neurological impairment and fingernail or hair loss high levels of zn in drinking water may cause stomach cramps vomiting and sometimes nausea 8 moreover a high concentration of ni can damage the dna of the hands 10 the removal of hms during bf is highly dependent on the site conditions source water quality matrix and hm type various studies have been conducted to investigate the biogeochemical processes taking place during the infiltration of river water into alluvial aquifers and its impacts on the removal of hms 11 12 these studies highlight that the adsorption of hms during the filtration process is considerably impacted by the water quality matrix of the raw water more specifically the ph dissolved oxygen and dissolved organic matter dom dom contains multiple functional groups that have an affinity for hms and hence may affect the mobility of hms in aquatic and soil systems during the bf process 13 the interaction of dom and hms in surface water occurs in different ways 13 dom in surface water forms complexes after reaction with hms which reduces the bioavailability and toxicity of hms to aquatic organisms 10 the type of dom such as humic substances fulvic acid and humic acid influences the geochemical mobility of metal ions during the infiltration processes 13 according to reuteret al 14 metal humic complexes in natural water systems have a higher stability than inorganic metal compounds hence the presence of dom affects the variation in the behaviour of metal pollutants in natural water systems the risk of contaminated drinking water due to hms is increasing in particular in developing countries where industrial and human activities result in the discharge of waste with high organic concentration into water bodies 10 in a previous study 15 the authors discussed the behaviour of dom fractions during the bf process however the effect of dom on heavy metal removal during bf processes is not well understood in addition hardly any studies to elucidate the impact of dom fractions humic fulvic and protein on the behaviour of hms during the bf process had been carried out hence the main objective of this research was to study the behaviours of heavy metals during infiltration and extent to which these behaviours could be affected by the concentration and composition of organic matter in the source water especially in hot climate regions this is a prerequisite step towards the successful application of bf in arid climate countries therefore laboratory scale column studies were conducted at a controlled room temperature 30 c to investigate the effect of the feed water source and natural organic matter nom type humic like protein like tyrosine the combination of protein like and humic acid on the removal of hms cu zn ni pb and se during the infiltration process 2 materials and methods 2 1 filter media characteristics the silica sand grain size 0 8 1 25 mm used in this study was bought from wildkamp company netherlands the characteristics of the sand is presented in table s1 the media was washed with non chlorinated tap water to discard the debris before introducing into the columns the average bulk density and porosity of sand were 1500 kg m3 and 0 42 respectively the organic content and the hms concentrations of the sand were determined using the acid extraction method described in 16 the biological activity associated with the saturated sand was estimated in terms of adenosine triphosphate atp following the technique described in previous studies 15 17 2 2 column experiment 2 2 1 experimental set up laboratory scale soil column setup was used to assess the impact of organic matter on the removal of hms during the filtration process the pvc pipes with an internal diameter of 4 2 cm and a total height of 50 cm were used for all experiment all pipes were fitted with a stopper leaving a space of 5 cm at the top and 5 cm for supporting materials saturated gravels at the bottom natural silica sand with a grain size ranging between 0 7 and 1 25 mm was filled up on top of the gravel for about 40 cm in all columns then the column was fitted with connectors from both ends to fix the influent and effluent tube the tube was connected to the influent tank of about 10 l by using a polyethylene tube the influents and effluents tubes were replaced after every five days and also covered with black materials and foils to reduce biofilm formation during the experimental process the influent container was cleaned with diluted hcl and washed several times with distilled water before introducing the feedwater into the tank aeration was executed by inducing air tubes connected from the oxygen gas diffuser into the feed water tanks the dissolved oxygen do was monitored continuously to ensure the oxygen supplied is enough to support the experimental condition do 7 mg l to introduce the feedwater from the tank into the column at the desirable hydraulic load rate a variable speed peristaltic pump was attached to the bottom of the column the experiment was implemented at a controlled temperature room 30 c to assure the possibility of removing hms during bf in hot climate areas different parameters were monitored periodically to ensure that the experiments were conducted under the desired conditions such parameters include the dissolved oxygen ph of the influent infiltration rate and the concentration of hms in the feed water 2 2 2 effect of dom composition of raw water on hm removal during bf four pvc columns were fed with different types of source waters to investigate the effect of the feed water organic matter composition on the removal of hms therefore four types of feed water were prepared from different sources including i non chlorinated tap water nctw with a low organic content ii delft canal dc water collected from a canal iii secondary treated wastewater obtained from the harnaschpolder wwtp and mixed with delft canal water to simulate contaminated surface water systems dcww and iv water containing extractable organic matter weom which contains higher concentrations of humic compounds which was prepared following the method proposed by guigueet al 18 the physical chemical water quality parameters of all feed waters were analysed before the start of the experiment table 1 the ph of the feed waters was adjusted to 7 8 1 using naoh solution the column was run in the up flow mode and the empty bed contact time was 12 h 2 2 3 effect of nom type on hm removal during bf this experiment was principally conducted to investigate the impact of the nom type and concentration on the hm removal efficiency during a bf therefore four columns were developed and ripened at 30 c and hydraulic rate of 0 3 m day the first column was fed with nctw and used as a control sample the other columns were fed with mixtures of nctw and different nom types i humic ha ii ty and iii a mixture of 50 ha and 50 ty ha ty each type of nom was injected at four different concentrations 5 10 15 and 20 mg c l the experiments were conducted for each concentration and samples from the influent and effluent were taken daily 2 2 4 effect of nom type on specific hm removal efficiency the main target of this experiment was to analyse the impact of nom type on the removal efficiency of specific hm s during saturated infiltration and to assess whether the presence of multiple metals in the feed water can affect the adsorption characteristics of other hm s and their behaviours toward the organic matter fractions therefore eight columns were prepared and ripened for two months subsequently the columns were fed with nctw containing different nom types cu ii and se iv were spiked individually into the feed water of the four columns and the experiment took seven days at each hydraulic rate the thomas model was used to estimate the breakthrough of the metals and impact of the nom type on the adsorption parameters adsorption capacity and rate of the tested metals during the filtration process this kinetic model assumes that adsorption is governed by the mass transfer and chemical reaction processes and this reaction is a reversible second order reaction which obeys the langmuir adsorption kinetics thomas model in the linear form is described as follows eq 1 19 1 ln c 0 c t 1 k t h q 0 x q k t h c 0 t k t h is thomas adsorption rate constant l hr μg q 0 is the adsorption capacity μg g x is the mass of adsorbent g q is the flow rate of the feed water l hr c0 and ct are the initial and breakthrough concentration μg l 2 3 analytical methods samples were collected from both influent and effluent of the columns and filtered using 0 45 μm filtration whatman dassel germany the samples collected were acidified with 0 5 ml of concentrated hcl and stored at a controlled temperature room 4 c the metal cu zn ni and pb concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry xseries ii thermo scientific the limit of detection lod of metals was 10 μg l the se concentration was quantified with a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer solaar mqze gf95 thermo electron co where the lod was 5 μg l the combustion technique was employed to determine the organic content doc in mg c l of the influent and effluent samples using a total organic carbon analyser toc vcpn tn shimadzu japan lod 20 mg l specific ultraviolet absorbance suva254 l mg 1 m 1 was estimated to define the aromaticity of the influent and effluent suva254 was calculated as a ratio between the dom of the water sample and its ultraviolet absorbance uv at 254 nm m 1 the uv absorbance was determined using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2501pc shimadzu the organic constituents of the samples were determined with the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem technique fluoromax 3 spectrofluorometer horiba jobin yvon edison the fluorescence intensity of the samples was determined at the excitation wavelengths λex 240 452 nm with 4 nm intervals and at the emission wavelengths λem 290 500 nm with 2 nm intervals the fluorescence indices including the humification index hix fluorescence index fix and biological index bix were used to characterise the organic fluorescence characteristics of the feed water these indices were described in details by gaboret al 20 hix is an indicator of the humification degree of the feed water and estimated as follows 21 2 h i x f i λ e m 434 480 n m f i λ e m 434 480 n m f i λ e m 300 344 n m a t λ e x 254 n m fix is used to detect the source of dom in water terrestrial or microbial the value of fix for each sample was estimated following eq 3 20 and it varies between 1 2 1 8 with lower values refer to dom of terrestrial origin 3 f i x f i λ e m 450 f i λ e m 500 a t λ e x 370 n m bix was used to estimate the contribution of microbial dom to the total organic content of the feed water this parameter was determined using eq 4 22 4 b i x f i λ e m 380 f i λ e m 430 a t λ e x 310 n m 2 4 fluorescence modelling the fluorescence eem spectroscopy was combined with the parallel factor analysis parafac algorithm to discretise the fluorescence dataset into independent fluorescence components this technique has been widely used to identify organic matter characteristics of surface and subsurface water systems 15 23 the parafac technique uses an alternating least squares algorithm to separate the fluorescence dataset into independent fluorescence components with different dissolved organic fractions and a residual error term eq 5 24 5 x i j k f 1 f a i f b j f c k f ε i j k i 1 i j 1 j k 1 k f 1 f where x i j k is the fluorescence intensity of the ith sample at the kth excitation and jth emission wavelength f represents the number of fluorescence components a i f is the score of each f th component and relates to the fluorophore f concentration in sample i b j f is the scaled estimates loading of the emission spectrum of the f th fluorescence component c k f links to the excitation spectrum of the f th fluorescence component and expressed as loading and ε i j k is the residual term representing the unaccounted variation of the model a fluorescence dataset of 80 samples collected from the feed water was used to develop and validate the parafac models following the steps proposed by murphyet al 24 briefly an initial exploratory examination was first implemented to identify the poor quality measured data outliers and removed them from the dataset the outliers samples or variables are commonly produced due to sampling or measuring errors and are determined by conducting the leverage analysis the leverage value ranges between zero and one and expresses the deviation of measurement from the average data distribution then models with different components 3 7 proceeded and tested using different diagnostics techniques including split half validation the randomness of residuals and core consistency 24 2 5 data analysis the two way analysis of variance anova and post hoc tukey test were used to assess the significance of the impact of organic composition of the feed water and nom type on the removal of hms during the column filtration process the impact was considered significant if the level of significance p was below or equal to 0 05 in addition a spearman rank correlation ρ analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between the fluorescence characteristics of the feed water and the hm removal during the filtration process the strength of the relationship was considered high if the correlation value ρ 0 7 moderate if 0 4 ρ 0 7 and low if ρ 0 4 25 3 results 3 1 impact of feed water source on hm removal efficiency the effect of the organic composition of the feed water on the hm removal efficiency was studied with laboratory scale columns and different water sources spiked with various concentrations of hms the experiments were conducted at different hydraulic rates 0 3 0 6 and 1 0 m day 3 1 1 organic characteristics of feed water the results table 2 infer that nctw had the lowest concentration of organic matter its value ranged between 3 47 and 3 67 mg c l this feed water also showed had low suva 1 76 0 14 l mg g and hix 0 49 values which indicates its aliphatic organic composition the doc of the dc water 11 25 0 81 mg l and dcww 11 41 0 59 mg l were significantly higher than that of the weom feed water 9 7 0 24 mg l however the weom contained a higher concentration of aromatic compounds than the dc water and dcww the average suva values of the dc water dcww and weom were 2 99 0 11 3 72 0 39 and 3 82 0 27 l mg g respectively these results were confirmed by the fluorescence indices which revealed that the weom had a higher humic concentration hix 0 84 and fewer microbial derived compounds bix 0 54 than the dc water hix 0 8 bix 0 72 and dcww hix 0 74 bix 0 79 moreover the fix of the weom was evidently lower than that of the other feed waters suggesting that its humic content originated mainly from terrestrial sources 3 1 2 effect of organic composition of feed water on hm removal efficiency the results showed that pb ii had the highest capability to be removed during the filtration process the effluent concentration of pb ii in all columns was below the detection limit 5 μg l of the instrument under all experimental conditions however cu ii zn ii and ni ii exhibited lower removal efficiencies 65 95 these removal efficiencies were highly dependent p 0 05 on the organic concentration and composition of the feed water with a preferential removal at a low organic concentration fig 1 the removal efficiencies of cu ii ni ii and zn ii for dc feed water were 88 1 88 6 90 2 for the dcww 66 4 75 9 70 3 for the weom 79 1 85 3 87 4 and for the nctw 98 1 93 3 97 1 at a hydraulic loading rate of 1 0 m day these removal efficiencies changed by 1 16 at lower hydraulic rates 0 6 and 0 3 m day figs s1 and s2 therefore the hydraulic loading rate had no significant effect p 0 2 0 47 on the hm removal efficiencies cu ii zn ii ni ii during the filtration process nevertheless se iv was the most persistent metal to be removed during the filtration process the removal efficiency of se iv depended highly on the feed water organic composition p 0 001 the average removal efficiencies of se iv for the columns fed with dc water dcww weom and nctw were 23 5 25 5 7 4 and 4 2 at a hydraulic loading rate of 1 0 m day respectively moreover the statistical analysis revealed that the infiltration rate had no significant effect p 0 2 on the se iv removal efficiency the se iv removal efficiency in this study was linked to the biological activity associated with the sand the atp concentrations of the sand media of the columns fed with dcww dc water weom and nctw were 9 3 1 28 9 2 1 04 5 1 0 33 and 3 3 0 47 μg g respectively furthermore the correlation between se iv removal efficiency and atp concentration was 0 96 3 2 impact of fluorescence organic compounds on hm removal 3 2 1 fluorescence modelling the parafac eem model decomposed successfully the fluorescence data collected from the influents of the columns into three main components representing different organic composition groups the contour plots and loadings of the identified fluorescence components are presented in fig 2 the openfluor database which employs tucker s congruence coefficient to determine the similarity degree between the components was used to identify the separated parafac components and matched them to those recognised at the same excitation and emission wavelengths in the previous studies table s2 the first component pc1 exhibited maximal excitation wavelengths λex at 240 and 344 nm and maximal emission wavelengths λem at 474 nm hence this component probably corresponded to humic compounds derived from terrestrial sources 26 component 2 pc2 exhibited two maxima λex at 240 and 300 nm and a single maximum λem at 396 nm this component matched well with humic compounds originating from microbial sources 23 component 3 pc3 exhibited two maxima λex at 240 and 272 nm and a maximum λem at 316 nm this component resembled protein like fluorophores originating from microbial sources 15 the results table 2 refers that weom and dcww feed water has the highest content of terrestrial and microbial humic compounds respectively whereas nctw retained with the lowest concentration of the three organic fluorescence compounds 3 2 2 relationship between dom fluorescence composition and hm removal efficiency the correlations between hm removal efficiency and organic fluorescence characteristics of the feed waters are presented in fig 3 the results demonstrate that the organic matter concentration and fluorescence composition of the feed water had a significant impact on the hm behaviour during the filtration process pb ii was impacted least by the variations in the organic concentration of the feed water the correlation between the pb ii removal efficiency and organic matter concentration was ρ 0 21 conversely dom suppressed the removal efficiencies of cu ii ni ii and zn ii in the sand surface and negative relationships between the removal efficiencies of these metals and organic concentration of the feed water were observed the fluorescence indices results revealed that the humic content of the feed water affected negatively the adsorption of cu ii zn ii and ni ii and negative correlations between the removal efficiency of the previously mentioned metals and fluorescence characteristics hix bix and fix of the feed water were observed cu ii was more affected by the changes in the humic content of the feed water than ni ii and zn ii the correlations between cu ii ni ii and zn ii removal efficiencies and hix of the feed water were 0 63 0 53 and 0 36 respectively the parafac data revealed that the terrestrial humic and microbial humic substances were highly correlated with the removal efficiencies of cu ii ni ii and zn ii thus the humic compounds regardless of their structures can react with the three metals and reduce their adsorption efficiencies in contrast organic matter enhanced the removal efficiency of se iv during the filtration process a strong positive correlation was detected between the se iv removal efficiency and the organic concentration of the feed water the fluorescence data revealed that the se iv removal efficiency depended weakly on the level of humic compounds in the feed water in addition a weak correlation ρ 0 33 was detected between the se iv removal efficiency and hix of the feed water however the bix ρ 0 69 and fix ρ 0 57 exhibited a good correlation the se iv removal efficiency correlated well with the fluorescence intensity of the protein like ρ 0 72 and microbial humic compounds ρ 0 58 in conclusion the se iv removal efficiency showed a stronger correlation to the biodegradable matter concentration of the feed water during the filtration process 3 3 impact of nom on hm removal efficiency the laboratory scale column experiments were conducted to investigate thoroughly the effect of organic matter on hms removal efficiency during filtration with different noms ha ty and a mixture of ha ty at different concentrations 5 10 15 20 mg l in the feed water the fluorescence characteristics of the feed water are presented in fig s3 3 3 1 effect of nom type and concentration on hm removal efficiency the type and concentration of the nom had a significant influence on the hm removal efficiency during the filtration process fig 4 the removal efficiency of pb ii exceeded 90 in the presence of ty the post hoc tests tukey method showed that there were no statistically significant differences in the removal efficiencies of pb ii in feed water containing different concentrations of ty or a mixture of ha and ty this indicates the dominate role of labile organic compounds ty in enhancing the removal efficiency of pb ii during the filtration process however regarding the column fed with ha the pb ii removal efficiency exhibited a gradual decrease with increasing ha concentration in the feed water the pb ii removal efficiencies were 97 0 12 93 1 5 86 2 5 and 73 3 for humic concentrations of 5 10 15 and 20 mg c l in the feed water respectively this implies that the highly concentrated ha compounds 5 mg c l possessed sufficient capacity to suppress the adsorption of pb ii onto the sand surface the nom type affected significantly the removal efficiencies of cu ii ni ii and zn ii during the filtration process with a preferential removal in the presence of ty however no significant difference in the removal efficiencies of these metals was observed for the columns fed with different concentrations of ty because their removal efficiencies all exceeded 90 by contrast the ha compounds deteriorated the adsorption efficiencies of these metals during the filtration process the removal efficiencies of cu ii zn ii and ni ii were 85 5 91 2 and 96 0 6 for the column fed with 5 mg c l ha respectively as these removal efficiencies decreased to 19 8 66 5 and 68 5 for a ha concentration of 20 mg c l in the feed water respectively cu ii was most influenced by the increasing ha concentration the same trend was observed for the column which was fed with nctw spiked with an ha ty mixture whereby the removal efficiencies of cu ii ni ii and zn ii decreased by 45 18 and 12 when the feed mixture concentration increased by 15 mg l respectively thus humic compounds had a higher capacity than the ty compounds to suppress the adsorption efficiencies of cu ii ni ii and zn ii on a sand surface se iv removal efficiency depended highly on the type and concentration of nom in the feed water during filtration process the column fed with a mixture of ha and ty exhibited the highest se iv removal capacity during the filtration however the post hoc results revealed that there were no significant differences in the removal efficiencies of se iv between the columns fed with ty and ha ty on the other hand se iv exhibited a higher removal persistence in the absence of ty the removal efficiency of se iv was 16 3 for the column fed with 10 mg c l ha this removal efficiency decreased to 13 2 and 12 1 in the feed water with 15 and 20 mg c l ha respectively therefore it can be deduced that biodegradable compounds are feasible for the se iv removal in filtration processes 3 3 2 kinetic study of cu ii and se iv in infiltration process among the tested metals cu ii and se iv were most impacted by the varying nom types and concentrations during the filtration process therefore laboratory scale column studies were conducted to determine the adsorption kinetics of these two metals under different experimental conditions and the impact of the presence of other metals this set of experiments was conducted under the same experimental conditions however a fixed concentration of each metal was individually injected into the nctw feed water spiked with different nom types ha ty ha ty furthermore the thomas model was used to describe the breakthrough curves fig s4 and estimate the adsorption parameters adsorption capacity and rate of cu ii and se iv during the filtration process tables 3 and 4 the results show that the experimental data and model agreed well high r2 and low x2 according to table 3 the adsorption behaviour of cu ii in the columns fed with different nom compositions exhibited evident differences ty had a positive effect on the adsorption characteristics of cu ii during the filtration process in addition the breakthrough time of cu ii was longer for the column fed with nctw and ty than for the control column fed with only nctw based on the thomas model the adsorption capacity of cu ii increased from 2 01 2 89 μg g when 10 mg c l ty was added to the feed water by contrast ha compounds had a negative effect on the adsorption capacity of cu ii its value decreased to 0 53 and 1 01 μg g when ha and ha ty were added to the nctw feed water respectively furthermore the kinetic results revealed that the presence of other metals in the raw water reduced the effect of humic compounds on the adsorption of cu and increased the adsorption capacity of the sand the adsorption capacities were 2 83 and 1 9 μg g for the columns fed with ha and ha ty in the presence of other metals respectively however this effect was negligible for the columns supplied with nctw and ty regarding se iv table 4 the adsorption capacity of the sand was lower for the column fed with ha 0 003 μg g and higher for the column fed with ha ty 0 016 μg g and ty 0 024 μg g thus the biodegradable compounds ty appeared to promote the removal of se iv during the filtration process however the presence of other metals in the raw water had a negative effect on the adsorption characteristics of se iv during the filtration process the adsorption capacities of the sand decreased to 0 002 0 019 and 0 012 μg g for the columns fed with ha ty and ha ty respectively 4 discussion 4 1 removal of hms during bank filtration the pb ii removal efficiency was higher than other metals during filtration regardless of the surrounding environmental conditions more specifically the pb removal efficiency was above 90 under all experimental conditions different hydraulic rates and feed water organic compositions according to kalakodioet al 27 precipitation and adsorption are the main mechanisms which remove pb ii during the sand filtration process furthermore a phreeqc analysis was conducted in this study to determine the precipitation characteristics of the added pb ii based on the results its concentration in the feed water was insufficient for precipitation saturation index si 1 which implies that the removal of pb ii during the column experiment was mainly caused by adsorption several studies 28 30 highlighted that pb has a higher affinity to the organic matter and silicates groups at the surface of the soil than other metals sontheimer 31 reported an average pb ii removal efficiency of 75 at bf sites along the rhine river germany in this research the experiment was conducted at high temperature 30 2 c which considerably enhanced the adsorption characteristics of the metal during filtration awanet al 32 reported that pb ii has a high probability to become hydrolysed in water thus it can be readily chemisorbed on the sand the hydrolysis and adsorption processes were strongly enhanced by the increased temperature furthermore guanxinget al 33 highlighted that the adsorption of pb ii into the soil is an endothermic reaction and its efficiency is positively related to temperature the high pb ii removal capacity of a sand filtration process was also observed in column experiment conducted at 25 c 34 thus it can be concluded that the bf technique is capable of removing pb ii from source water in particular under hot climate conditions the removal efficiencies of cu ii zn ii and ni ii were lower 65 95 than that of pb ii during filtration and statistically independent of the flow rate of the feed water consequently the retention time did not play a significant role in the removal of these metals during the filtration process the efficiency of the bf technique in the removal of these metals under different hydrological and climate conditions has been investigated nagy kovácset al 3 reported removal efficiencies of 59 99 of these metals at bf sites along the danube river hungary awanet al 32 highlighted that the removal efficiencies of these metals are highly dependent on their affinity to negatively charge groups e g oh at the soil surface which depends strongly on the environmental conditions e g temperature ph and organic content of the raw water a high persistence of se iv was observed during the column filtration process the removal efficiency of se iv did not exceed 40 under all experimental conditions this removal efficiency was statistically independent of the infiltration rate of the raw water schmidtet al 35 reported a low se iv removal efficiency 15 at a bf site along the rhine river germany the lower se iv removal efficiency during the filtration process was mainly ascribed to its natural characteristics of a high solubility and low adsorption characteristics which was also reported by liet al 36 4 2 impact of organic matter on hm removal efficiency the organic composition of the feed water had a minor effect on the pb ii removal efficiency during filtration according to ahmedet al 37 organic compounds augment the pb ii removal efficiency by forming adsorbable complexes however this research study revealed that feed water with a higher ha concentration 15 mg c l might suppress the removal efficiency of pb ii by 20 likewise ha had a negative impact on the removal efficiencies of cu ii zn ii and ni ii during filtration the highest reduction in removal efficiency was observed when the weom higher terrestrial humic content and dcww higher microbial humic content feed water were used the experimental results showed that the addition of 20 mg c l ha compounds to the feed water reduced the removal efficiencies of cu ii zn ii and ni ii by 40 75 similarly the se iv removal efficiency decreased with increasing ha concentration in the feed water the lower removal efficiency of the former metals in the presence of a higher ha concentration was mainly caused by i the ability of organic matter to react with metals and to form aqueous complex compounds which increases the mobility of the metals and reduces their adsorption efficiencies in the sand surface 38 ii ha compounds have a high potential to accumulate on the sand surface which reduces its adsorption capacity 39 iii ha compounds contain active functional groups e g carboxylic phenol and catechol oh which may associate to the minerals on the sand surface and compete with metal for the adsorption sites 40 iv the ha compounds can change the soil structure by improving its aggregation and thereby reducing the number of adsorption sites 41 interestingly the fluorescence data demonstrated that the ha compounds regardless of their source microbial or terrestrial reacted with these metals and reduced their adsorption efficiency moreover ha compounds enhanced the desorption rates of the metals via chelating and exchange reaction processes tianet al 42 illustrated that the desorption rate of se iv increases by approximately 50 in the presence of hydrophobic ha compounds the hydrophilic compounds could release a low amount below 3 5 of the adsorbed se 43 the impact of ha compounds on the metal removal depends strongly on the properties of the metal and its adsorption mechanisms on the sand surface in this research study cu ii was most impacted by the variation in the ha concentration in the feed water however cu ii exhibited a higher removal efficiency than zn ii and ni ii in the column fed with low organic content feed water nctw the sorption of cu ii is predominately based on the formation of strong electrostatic and covalent bonds with negative functional groups e g organic matter on sand surface grains 39 by contrast zn ii and ni ii tend to remain on the surface through an electrostatic attraction process 39 therefore cu ii is expected to have a higher affinity than zn ii and ni ii for the functional groups on the sand grains during the filtration process however this affinity decreases with increasing humic concentration in the feed water hence cu ii prefers to react with soluble ha substances and to form aqueous complexes than to be adsorbed onto active organic sorption sites of the soil the zn ii and ni ii adsorption rates were also affected to a lower extent by the humic content of the feed water zhaoet al 38 pointed out that cu ii binds stronger to the active groups e g phenols oh amines nh2 and carboxyl cooh of microbial and terrestrial humic compounds than zn ii and ni ii by contrast the biodegradable protein like compounds enhanced the hm removal efficiency during filtration according to abdelradyet al 44 lmw organic compounds tend to be adsorbed faster onto the sand surface than high molecular weight hmw compounds during a filtration process therefore a metal with a higher affinity towards lmw compounds is more likely to be removed during filtration moreover biodegradable matter promotes biological activity associated with the sand and thus enhances the biosorption and accumulation of metal on its surface 45 in this study the sand column with a higher microbial activity higher atp concentration had a higher hm removal efficiency during the infiltration process moreover 5 mg c l ty was sufficient for optimising removal of hm cu zn ni and pb during the filtration however it worth to note that it might enhance the development of an anaerobic environment within the infiltration zone and consequently promote the reduction and releasing of metals into the bank filtrate 4 3 impact of metals on sorption of cu and se during bank filtration the conducted kinetic experiments revealed that the adsorption rate of cu ii increased significantly when the feed water contained a mixture of metals hence the existence of other metals in the feed water retarded presumably the formation rate of the aqueous cu ii ha complex by contrast the presence of other metals in the raw water had an adverse effect on the adsorption capacity of the sand for se iv during filtration a lower se iv removal efficiency impact even when the raw water contained lmw ty or hmw humic organic compounds dinhet al 46 pointed out that lmw organic compounds tend to react with metals and form stable ring complexes that compete with se iv for adsorption sites however hmw compounds can reduce the adsorption capacity of sand by accumulating and blocking adsorption sites or changing the sand structure as previously discussed therefore it can be concluded that good removal of se iv can be achieved with bf when the raw water has a low concentration of metals and high content of biodegradable organic matter 5 conclusions laboratory scale column experiments were conducted to assess the impact of the feed water and organic composition on the removal of hms cu zn ni pb and se during the bf process and the following conclusions are drawn pb is the most probable metal to be adsorbed into the sand surface during the filtration process however humic compounds at concentrations above 15 mg c l reduced the adsorption efficiency by approximately 20 in pure water cu zn and ni exhibited lower removal efficiency during the filtration process 70 95 for the column fed with different water sources furthermore the experimental results showed that 10 mg c l humic compounds could reduce the adsorption efficiencies of these metals by 40 75 se was the most persistent metal during the column filtration process among the tested metals its removal was less than 40 under all the experimental conditions biodegradable matter enhanced the adsorption rates of the aforementioned metals whereas humic compounds negatively affected their removal efficiencies parafac fluorescence data revealed that presence of both terrestrial and or microbial humic compounds reduced the adsorption efficiency of the metals the kinetic study revealed that the presence of other metals in the raw water reduced the influence of the humic compounds on the adsorption of cu and thus enhanced its removal efficiency conversely the presence of hms exhibited a negative effect on the removal of se during the filtration process therefore this study highlighted the impact of dissolved organic matter composition on the removal efficiencies of hms which should be considered in the design and installation of

overview of anaerobic and aerobic digestion for pome treatment is presented next the process for biogas treatment is briefly outlined the subsequent section shall report the findings of the process modelling and optimisation study the study is then concluded in the last section of this paper 2 pome treatment 2 1 anaerobic digestion and technology anaerobic digestion process is primarily used for treatment of waste sludge and high strength organic wastes 8 the process involves the decomposition of organic matter by microorganisms in the absence of oxygen forming digestate and biogas as products it poses advantages in terms of lower biomass yield and energy generation in the form of methane the process can be operated in the mesophilic temperature range 30 35 c or thermophilic temperature range 50 60 c due to the relatively low quality of treated effluent anaerobic treatment is normally coupled with an aerobic process as the subsequent operating unit four basic steps are involved in the overall anaerobic oxidation of waste 1 hydrolysis 2 fermentation acidogenesis 3 acetogenesis and 4 methanogenesis figs 1 and 2 summarize the reactive scheme for the anaerobic digestion of organic matter fig 3 depicts a schematic of a simple non proprietary design of covered anaerobic lagoon process the depth of a lagoon normally ranges from 5 to 10 m the hydraulic retention time hrt for covered lagoon process is in the range of 20 90 days while the solid retention time srt can vary from about 50 100 days 8 the method is capable of achieving approximately 90 efficiency of chemical oxygen demand cod removal improvement in the performance of the process can be accomplished by lagoon systems consisting of a treatment train involving a series of lagoons anaerobic aerobic or facultative and maturation 24 the technology is widely utilised in various palm oil mills in malaysia as it is capable of handling a wide range of waste characteristics including solids oils and greases simple and relatively economical construction large volume that can provide equalization of loads use of low loading high effluent quality 8 odour control and capture of greenhouse gases however the drawback is the low processing rate requirement of huge land area inefficiencies in feed flow distribution and maintenance of geomembrane cover 8 2 2 aerobic digestion and technology aerobic digestion is commonly applied in the treatment of 1 waste activated sludge only 2 mixtures of waste activated sludge or trickling filter sludge and primary sludge as well as 3 waste sludge from extended aeration plants 8 the process involves the biochemical oxidative stabilization of wastewater sludge in open or closed tanks that are separate from the liquid process system 25 as air or oxygen is a requirement in this process it is typically supplied by surface aerators or diffusers the principle of aerobic digestion is such that when there is depletion in external substrate available microorganisms begin to metabolize their own cellular mass the process can be presented in two steps consisting of the direct oxidation of any biodegradable matter and the oxidation of microbial cellular material by organisms eq 2 signifies the predominant reaction in aerobic digestion which describes the endogenous respiration of microorganisms 1 o r g a n i c m a t t e r o 2 c e l l u l a r m a t e r i a l c o 2 h 2 o 2 c e l l u l a r m a t e r i a l o 2 d i g e s t e d s l u d g e c o 2 h 2 o aerobic ponds are shallow ponds with depths ranging from 0 3 0 45 m constant supply of dissolved oxygen do is maintained throughout the entire depth of the ponding system the treatment technique is purposed for the stabilization of organic wastes accomplished by aerobic bacteria and algae algae is retained at the surface through supplementary mixing to allow maximum rates of photosynthesis and oxygen production as well as inhibiting the settlement of algae which results in an anaerobic bottom layer 26 the detention time for the system ranges from 2 to 6 days 26 the oxidation pond has a bod removal efficiency between 74 81 27 3 biogas treatment biogas generated from pome treatment is subjected to reduction in hydrogen sulphide h2s and water content prior to its utilisation in gas engine for power generation the presence of h2s and water promotes corrosion through the formation of sulfuric acid and carbonic acid the permissible level of h2s concentration in gas engine is typically below 200 ppm 2 h2s content is reduced by means of either biological chemical or water scrubber for pome biological scrubber is typically applied owing to its low operating cost biological scrubbers or bio trickling filters treat undesired contaminants in a gas stream by passing it through a bed of microorganisms namely thiobacillus genus which feeds on h2s 28 moisture content is reduced through a gas dehumidifier unit which can either be a dryer chiller or cyclone the dehumidifier extracts water from biogas which in turn prevents condensation and acid formation for enhanced engine efficiency and reduced fuel gas consumption high quality and low moisture biogas with relative humidity below 80 is necessary 2 the electrical efficiency of gas engines is normally between 36 42 2 biogas production is highly associated with the methanogenic activity the major factors affecting methane production include ph temperature solid retention time srt hydraulic retention time hrt and organic loading rate olr etc generally microbial growth is favourable under ph of 6 8 7 2 with tolerable range within 4 9 5 30 anaerobic treatment can be operated under mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures digesters operating at thermophilic temperature provides higher substrate decomposition rate and is able to accommodate higher olr hence more biogas produced at shorter hrt 31 34 retaining high srt establishes a stable running with higher tolerance to toxicity and shock loading 35 long hrt allows for more contact time between substrates and microbes but is compromised with a larger digester volume and therefore additional costs short retention time establishes better material flow but reduced in biogas productivity at higher olr cod removal efficiency declines 36 37 40 in this work the ph temperature and retention time is kept constant while the manipulated variable investigated is recycle ratio of sludge the latter is attributed to substrate concentration and hence olr besides the cod removal efficiency varies with respect to different recycle ratio of sludge the volume of digester changes according to olr which directly determines the overall cost of the system as will be shown in the latter section that the recycle ratio of sludge is the main design parameter that determines the optimum system design 4 results and discussion modelling of the covered lagoon process was performed using superpro designer v9 0 15 inputs for the modelling were based on available data of an existing palm oil mill located in negeri sembilan malaysia commercial name is not revealed and literature data the characteristics of pome in the existing plant and the actual plant performance may be found in appendix as shown in the simulation flowsheet in fig 4 pome with feed flow rate of 42 000 kg h and cod of 62 000 mg l see composition in table 1 undergoes anaerobic digestion in the covered lagoon represented by the digester ad 101 the process involves different microbes responsible for the degradation of organic matter at each phase which results in the production of biogas and digestate the reaction scheme for the digester is adapted from fig 1 with kinetics involved adapted from 41 and 43 see details in appendix biogas produced is made up mostly of methane and carbon dioxide which is subsequently subjected to treatment prior to its utilization in gas engine for power generation the purification steps include the removal of hydrogen sulphide h2s in a bio trickling filter tf 101 where the oxidation of h2s occurs followed by reduction in moisture content via a chiller hx 101 stoichiometry of the reaction scheme incorporated into the bio trickling filter is found in appendix a 70 h2o removal is assumed for the chiller in order to achieve the desired outlet stream as per specification of the existing plant 51 the digestate is then fed to the aerobic pond ab 101 for further breakdown of biodegradable matters and for stabilization of wastewater sludge the pond effluent is proceeded to the discharge pond depicted by a clarifier cl 101 the clarifier is responsible for the separation of wastewater from suspended particles on the basis of gravitational influence biomass and dead biomass removal of 99 were assumed to allow maximum efficiency for the clarifier to comply with the strict regulatory on the discharge effluent standards of 20 ppm bod a polishing step accomplished by granular media gm filtration gmf 101 is employed the wastewater is passed over the filter in which the remaining particulate matter attach itself to the filter media the filtration process was assumed to have a 95 removal efficiency to achieve desired effluent specification as per environmental regulation the sludge from cl 101 is split into two streams in which part of its proportion is recycled back to ad 101 while the remaining portion is dewatered using belt filter bf 101 accompanied by drying sldr 101 the base case will assume zero recycle and the effect of recycle ratio of sludge is further studied in subsequent section it is assumed that 99 of biomass and dead biomass to remain in the effluent sludge in bf 101 to allow maximum efficiency the resulting dried sludge is to be sold as fertilizer note that majority of the process units in the simulation flowsheet in fig 4 reflects the existing wastewater treatment plant in the palm oil mill note that there are newly incorporated equipment i e gm filtration gmf 101 belt filtration bf 1010 and sludge drying unit sldr 101 the addition of these units are meant to meet environmental regulation and to allow a more accurate and reliable economics representation no redundancy is assumed for the flowsheet 4 1 simulation results according to the lagoon performance data see table a2 in appendix the system is expected to have a cod removal efficiency ranging from 77 7 to 84 2 the simulation resulted in a cod removal efficiency of 92 which outperformed the actual data attributing to an ideal system this may be due to possible leachate in the filtration unit causing unwanted particulate matters to be released into the treated water effluent stream in reference to 21 studies revealed that for each tonne of pome a projected 28 m3 of biogas is produced the composition of the biogas is mainly comprised of bio methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 with a mass ratio of 65 35 irrespective to the generation of by products it is observed in table 2 that the simulated ch4 co2 ratio corresponds to the figures abovementioned the resulting biogas quality as outlined in table 3 is based on the existing plant specifications provided by chan 51 effluent from the gm filtration has a bod value of 8 ppm which complies to the discharge limit of 20 ppm the composition of this stream is shown in table 4 the sludge from clarifier was further split in which part of its proportion was recycled and the remaining proceeded with supplementary dewatering and drying to generate fertiliser as by product the recycle ratio of sludge is further investigated in the later subsection for process optimisation 4 2 economic analysis in this section financial viability of biogas production from pome treatment is evaluated the capital cost of equipment was obtained from equipment vendors and superpro designer and summarised in table a6 in the appendix the operating cost considers raw material air emission treatment and labour costs for this case polymer use in discharge pond cl 101 is assumed to be 1 kg note that pome is considered zero cost as it is waste that must be treated in order to comply with environmental regulation the air emission stream from aerobic pond ab 101 i e ap emission which has is assumed to have a treatment cost of 0 3 kg since it consists of co2 gas that will offset the carbon credit note also that dp emission stream from discharge pond cl 101 does not contain any co2 emission and hence no treatment cost is considered the labour cost is assumed to be at 2 hr for this case the source of revenues considered are biogas carbon credit as well as dried sludge to be sold as fertiliser see unit price in table 5 process economic was performed using the economic evaluation tool of superpro designer 9 0 15 with results summarised in table 6 from table 6 it is projected that the plant will generate a profit margin of 27 16 which will provide a return of investment at 21 48 the estimated period for breakeven is after 4 66 years the internal rate of return is at 14 3 as reported by sri rahayu 2 a desirable pome to energy project has to achieve an irr of 11 23 therefore the project studied is deemed as feasible and the pome to energy scheme is expected to generate great revenues and simultaneously achieve sustainability in terms of energy and environmental aspects 4 3 process optimisation for this subsection studies were performed to examine how recycle ratio of sludge affects methane production cod level and costings the recycle ratio ranging from 5 up to 95 was investigated with results shown in figs 5 and 6 to determine the relationships between the parameters involved from fig 5 it is observed that initially methane production increases proportionally with recycle ratio of sludge while the effluent cod level decreases analogous to an increase in recycle ratio of sludge however there is a shift in the trend as both graphs reach an inflection point at which a maximum methane production of 907 5 kg h and a minimum of 14 9 mg l effluent cod are achieved at the recycle ratio of 70 initially the high methane production rate can be characterised by the sufficient supply of organic matter which acts as substrates for methanogens to digest anaerobically microorganisms thus gain higher metabolism allowing higher growth rate thereby improves substrate removal and biomass growth 57 as a result the cod removal efficiency is enhanced nonetheless the gas production rate eventually reaches a maximum capacity in which further increment in olr deteriorates the digestion system this reflects the occurrence of anaerobic inhibition in the system 58 the introduction of higher feeding volume to the digester may result in shock loading to the microorganisms consequently the activity of methanogens are unable to accommodate the high olr in addition competition for substrate may exists from hydrolysis and acidification bacteria as a result superfluous volatile fatty acids vfa accumulate over time resulting in intense inhibition and process instability an increase in effluent vfa further raises the cod level fig 6 emphasizes on the effect of recycle ratio of sludge on various cost elements the annualised capital cost acc was determined based on capital cost following eq 3 59 it has been assumed that the fractional interest i of 0 07 for a period n of 5 years the net expenditure on the other hand is given as the summation of the acc and aoc annual operating cost and their difference with the total revenue eq 4 the latter is mainly contributed by the sales of biogas 3 a c c c a p i t a l c o s t i 1 i n 1 i n 1 where i fractional interest rate per year n number of years 4 n e t e x p e n d i t u r e a c c a o c t o t a l r e v e n u e for this case a steady increment is observed for the annualised capital cost and total revenue while the operating cost encounters a constant decrement this signifies an inverse relationship between capital and operating costs similarly in previous case all graphs encounter a change in trend in which both capital and operating costs experience a sharp increase at the recycle ratio of sludge of approximately 80 on the other hand a sudden drop is witnessed for the total revenue at the recycle ratio of 65 as the olr increases the size of the equipment ensues to accommodate higher flow capacity resulting in higher capital investment on the contrary since recycle of sludge reduces both raw material i e polymer for discharge pond cl 101 requirement and waste generation ap emission stream a lower operating cost is presumed the sudden increase in operating cost can be associated with the inhibition of digestion process as explained above leading to more waste produced and subsequently increases the cost for waste treatment and utilities the net expenditure was computed using eq 2 as stated above it is observed that a minimum value of 11 812 yr was recorded at 30 recycle ratio of sludge irvan et al 60 conducted a study on the effect of recycle sludge on the biogas production from pome the authors present a finding in which at 34 of recycle sludge the performance of the digestion system is enhanced with 82 improvement on volatile solid vs decomposition and 81 of cod removal efficiency is achieved another related study 58 investigated the effect of different sludge recycling rate of 6 12 and 18 m3 day on methane production and cod removal efficiency the paper shows an initial increase in methane production but reduces upon reaching 18 m3 day of sludge recycle in which higher application of olr is observed on the contrary the cod removal efficiency remained stable at which up to 95 is attained in this study the relationship between recycle ratio of sludge and methane production demonstrated similar results as reported in previous work 58 the effect of recycle ratio of sludge on various cost elements presented indicates the optimum point lies at 30 showing results comparable to the ones reported by irvan et al 60 hence it is justified that the optimal recycle ratio of sludge is achieved at 30 at which high production of methane with low effluent cod is achieved while considering the trade off between capital and operating cost in summary a balance between substrate concentration and the availability of microorganisms has to be realised for optimal digester operation note that the optimum recycle ratio of sludge in this study is not universal as it is dependent on factors such as operating condition process configurations and economic parameters 4 4 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the effect of the unit price of individual revenue stream on the total revenue fig 7 demonstrates the distribution of total revenue based on earnings gained from individual streams the total revenue is most susceptible to changes in the profits yielded from biogas which contributes a majority of 69 of the total revenue the sensitivity of individual stream on the total revenue is further explored by varying the value of each stream at 20 180 from unit base price as shown in fig 8 biogas exhibits the most significant shift towards total revenue whereby only gradual shifts are observed for carbon credit and dried sludge this signifies biogas as the major contributor to the overall profits gain therefore one of the few key aspects in reviewing the degree of feasibility and profitability of pome to biogas production is the market value of biogas another sensitivity analysis is also performed to analyse the fluctuation of cod and bod values of pome inlet stream on its effect of the discharge effluent quality this is done by switching the simulation model to rating mode 15 doing so means that the converged simulation model will be tested for its robustness as shown in fig 9 the discharge effluent will experience slight increase of its cod values to 25 ppm when the cod value of the pome inlet rises to 75 000 mg l from the base case value of 62 000 mg l similar trend is observed in fig 10 as the bod values of discharge effluent increases gradually to 10 2 mg l still well below the limit with the increase of bod value of pome inlet to 31 000 mg l from 26 800 mg l of base case in practise most palm oil mills will have a discharge pond to absorb this slight fluctuation before the final effluent is discharged to the environment 5 conclusion a study on biogas production from pome treatment via covered lagoon was successfully accomplished by means of a simulation tool namely superpro designer v9 0 this study validated the feasibility of biogas capture through anaerobic treatment of pome the simulation results indicate that bod and cod removal are up to the desired values in this study for a 42 000 kg h of pome feed 1 358 34 kg h of biogas was generated as equivalent to 29 m3 of biogas produced per tonne of pome economic evaluation has proven the plant to be financially feasible and sustainable the plant is projected to provide npv 7 interest of 2 830 000 and irr of 14 3 within a payback period of 4 66 years process optimisation was conducted based on a case study on recycle ratio of sludge the optimisation results reveal that the optimal recycle ratio of sludge should be set to 30 despite that it does not correspond to the highest methane production which occurs at the recycle ratio of 70 the most significant factor affecting the feasibility and profitability of the system turned out to be the market value of biogas the robustness of the present work is further validated as the system remained at acceptable fluctuations in response to the volatility in feed future studies can be focused on investigating the effects of parameters such as ph temperature and hydraulic retention time hrt on methane production cod removal efficiency and economic feasibility another future exploration can consider the incorporation of second recycle loop at the aerobic pond effluent to examine the trade off between two recycle loops to achieve the optimum system performance and cost expenditure declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a table a1 shows the characteristic of pome in

temperature range 50 60 c due to the relatively low quality of treated effluent anaerobic treatment is normally coupled with an aerobic process as the subsequent operating unit four basic steps are involved in the overall anaerobic oxidation of waste 1 hydrolysis 2 fermentation acidogenesis 3 acetogenesis and 4 methanogenesis figs 1 and 2 summarize the reactive scheme for the anaerobic digestion of organic matter fig 3 depicts a schematic of a simple non proprietary design of covered anaerobic lagoon process the depth of a lagoon normally ranges from 5 to 10 m the hydraulic retention time hrt for covered lagoon process is in the range of 20 90 days while the solid retention time srt can vary from about 50 100 days 8 the method is capable of achieving approximately 90 efficiency of chemical oxygen demand cod removal improvement in the performance of the process can be accomplished by lagoon systems consisting of a treatment train involving a series of lagoons anaerobic aerobic or facultative and maturation 24 the technology is widely utilised in various palm oil mills in malaysia as it is capable of handling a wide range of waste characteristics including solids oils and greases simple and relatively economical construction large volume that can provide equalization of loads use of low loading high effluent quality 8 odour control and capture of greenhouse gases however the drawback is the low processing rate requirement of huge land area inefficiencies in feed flow distribution and maintenance of geomembrane cover 8 2 2 aerobic digestion and technology aerobic digestion is commonly applied in the treatment of 1 waste activated sludge only 2 mixtures of waste activated sludge or trickling filter sludge and primary sludge as well as 3 waste sludge from extended aeration plants 8 the process involves the biochemical oxidative stabilization of wastewater sludge in open or closed tanks that are separate from the liquid process system 25 as air or oxygen is a requirement in this process it is typically supplied by surface aerators or diffusers the principle of aerobic digestion is such that when there is depletion in external substrate available microorganisms begin to metabolize their own cellular mass the process can be presented in two steps consisting of the direct oxidation of any biodegradable matter and the oxidation of microbial cellular material by organisms eq 2 signifies the predominant reaction in aerobic digestion which describes the endogenous respiration of microorganisms 1 o r g a n i c m a t t e r o 2 c e l l u l a r m a t e r i a l c o 2 h 2 o 2 c e l l u l a r m a t e r i a l o 2 d i g e s t e d s l u d g e c o 2 h 2 o aerobic ponds are shallow ponds with depths ranging from 0 3 0 45 m constant supply of dissolved oxygen do is maintained throughout the entire depth of the ponding system the treatment technique is purposed for the stabilization of organic wastes accomplished by aerobic bacteria and algae algae is retained at the surface through supplementary mixing to allow maximum rates of photosynthesis and oxygen production as well as inhibiting the settlement of algae which results in an anaerobic bottom layer 26 the detention time for the system ranges from 2 to 6 days 26 the oxidation pond has a bod removal efficiency between 74 81 27 3 biogas treatment biogas generated from pome treatment is subjected to reduction in hydrogen sulphide h2s and water content prior to its utilisation in gas engine for power generation the presence of h2s and water promotes corrosion through the formation of sulfuric acid and carbonic acid the permissible level of h2s concentration in gas engine is typically below 200 ppm 2 h2s content is reduced by means of either biological chemical or water scrubber for pome biological scrubber is typically applied owing to its low operating cost biological scrubbers or bio trickling filters treat undesired contaminants in a gas stream by passing it through a bed of microorganisms namely thiobacillus genus which feeds on h2s 28 moisture content is reduced through a gas dehumidifier unit which can either be a dryer chiller or cyclone the dehumidifier extracts water from biogas which in turn prevents condensation and acid formation for enhanced engine efficiency and reduced fuel gas consumption high quality and low moisture biogas with relative humidity below 80 is necessary 2 the electrical efficiency of gas engines is normally between 36 42 2 biogas production is highly associated with the methanogenic activity the major factors affecting methane production include ph temperature solid retention time srt hydraulic retention time hrt and organic loading rate olr etc generally microbial growth is favourable under ph of 6 8 7 2 with tolerable range within 4 9 5 30 anaerobic treatment can be operated under mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures digesters operating at thermophilic temperature provides higher substrate decomposition rate and is able to accommodate higher olr hence more biogas produced at shorter hrt 31 34 retaining high srt establishes a stable running with higher tolerance to toxicity and shock loading 35 long hrt allows for more contact time between substrates and microbes but is compromised with a larger digester volume and therefore additional costs short retention time establishes better material flow but reduced in biogas productivity at higher olr cod removal efficiency declines 36 37 40 in this work the ph temperature and retention time is kept constant while the manipulated variable investigated is recycle ratio of sludge the latter is attributed to substrate concentration and hence olr besides the cod removal efficiency varies with respect to different recycle ratio of sludge the volume of digester changes according to olr which directly determines the overall cost of the system as will be shown in the latter section that the recycle ratio of sludge is the main design parameter that determines the optimum system design 4 results and discussion modelling of the covered lagoon process was performed using superpro designer v9 0 15 inputs for the modelling were based on available data of an existing palm oil mill located in negeri sembilan malaysia commercial name is not revealed and literature data the characteristics of pome in the existing plant and the actual plant performance may be found in appendix as shown in the simulation flowsheet in fig 4 pome with feed flow rate of 42 000 kg h and cod of 62 000 mg l see composition in table 1 undergoes anaerobic digestion in the covered lagoon represented by the digester ad 101 the process involves different microbes responsible for the degradation of organic matter at each phase which results in the production of biogas and digestate the reaction scheme for the digester is adapted from fig 1 with kinetics involved adapted from 41 and 43 see details in appendix biogas produced is made up mostly of methane and carbon dioxide which is subsequently subjected to treatment prior to its utilization in gas engine for power generation the purification steps include the removal of hydrogen sulphide h2s in a bio trickling filter tf 101 where the oxidation of h2s occurs followed by reduction in moisture content via a chiller hx 101 stoichiometry of the reaction scheme incorporated into the bio trickling filter is found in appendix a 70 h2o removal is assumed for the chiller in order to achieve the desired outlet stream as per specification of the existing plant 51 the digestate is then fed to the aerobic pond ab 101 for further breakdown of biodegradable matters and for stabilization of wastewater sludge the pond effluent is proceeded to the discharge pond depicted by a clarifier cl 101 the clarifier is responsible for the separation of wastewater from suspended particles on the basis of gravitational influence biomass and dead biomass removal of 99 were assumed to allow maximum efficiency for the clarifier to comply with the strict regulatory on the discharge effluent standards of 20 ppm bod a polishing step accomplished by granular media gm filtration gmf 101 is employed the wastewater is passed over the filter in which the remaining particulate matter attach itself to the filter media the filtration process was assumed to have a 95 removal efficiency to achieve desired effluent specification as per environmental regulation the sludge from cl 101 is split into two streams in which part of its proportion is recycled back to ad 101 while the remaining portion is dewatered using belt filter bf 101 accompanied by drying sldr 101 the base case will assume zero recycle and the effect of recycle ratio of sludge is further studied in subsequent section it is assumed that 99 of biomass and dead biomass to remain in the effluent sludge in bf 101 to allow maximum efficiency the resulting dried sludge is to be sold as fertilizer note that majority of the process units in the simulation flowsheet in fig 4 reflects the existing wastewater treatment plant in the palm oil mill note that there are newly incorporated equipment i e gm filtration gmf 101 belt filtration bf 1010 and sludge drying unit sldr 101 the addition of these units are meant to meet environmental regulation and to allow a more accurate and reliable economics representation no redundancy is assumed for the flowsheet 4 1 simulation results according to the lagoon performance data see table a2 in appendix the system is expected to have a cod removal efficiency ranging from 77 7 to 84 2 the simulation resulted in a cod removal efficiency of 92 which outperformed the actual data attributing to an ideal system this may be due to possible leachate in the filtration unit causing unwanted particulate matters to be released into the treated water effluent stream in reference to 21 studies revealed that for each tonne of pome a projected 28 m3 of biogas is produced the composition of the biogas is mainly comprised of bio methane ch4 and carbon dioxide co2 with a mass ratio of 65 35 irrespective to the generation of by products it is observed in table 2 that the simulated ch4 co2 ratio corresponds to the figures abovementioned the resulting biogas quality as outlined in table 3 is based on the existing plant specifications provided by chan 51 effluent from the gm filtration has a bod value of 8 ppm which complies to the discharge limit of 20 ppm the composition of this stream is shown in table 4 the sludge from clarifier was further split in which part of its proportion was recycled and the remaining proceeded with supplementary dewatering and drying to generate fertiliser as by product the recycle ratio of sludge is further investigated in the later subsection for process optimisation 4 2 economic analysis in this section financial viability of biogas production from pome treatment is evaluated the capital cost of equipment was obtained from equipment vendors and superpro designer and summarised in table a6 in the appendix the operating cost considers raw material air emission treatment and labour costs for this case polymer use in discharge pond cl 101 is assumed to be 1 kg note that pome is considered zero cost as it is waste that must be treated in order to comply with environmental regulation the air emission stream from aerobic pond ab 101 i e ap emission which has is assumed to have a treatment cost of 0 3 kg since it consists of co2 gas that will offset the carbon credit note also that dp emission stream from discharge pond cl 101 does not contain any co2 emission and hence no treatment cost is considered the labour cost is assumed to be at 2 hr for this case the source of revenues considered are biogas carbon credit as well as dried sludge to be sold as fertiliser see unit price in table 5 process economic was performed using the economic evaluation tool of superpro designer 9 0 15 with results summarised in table 6 from table 6 it is projected that the plant will generate a profit margin of 27 16 which will provide a return of investment at 21 48 the estimated period for breakeven is after 4 66 years the internal rate of return is at 14 3 as reported by sri rahayu 2 a desirable pome to energy project has to achieve an irr of 11 23 therefore the project studied is deemed as feasible and the pome to energy scheme is expected to generate great revenues and simultaneously achieve sustainability in terms of energy and environmental aspects 4 3 process optimisation for this subsection studies were performed to examine how recycle ratio of sludge affects methane production cod level and costings the recycle ratio ranging from 5 up to 95 was investigated with results shown in figs 5 and 6 to determine the relationships between the parameters involved from fig 5 it is observed that initially methane production increases proportionally with recycle ratio of sludge while the effluent cod level decreases analogous to an increase in recycle ratio of sludge however there is a shift in the trend as both graphs reach an inflection point at which a maximum methane production of 907 5 kg h and a minimum of 14 9 mg l effluent cod are achieved at the recycle ratio of 70 initially the high methane production rate can be characterised by the sufficient supply of organic matter which acts as substrates for methanogens to digest anaerobically microorganisms thus gain higher metabolism allowing higher growth rate thereby improves substrate removal and biomass growth 57 as a result the cod removal efficiency is enhanced nonetheless the gas production rate eventually reaches a maximum capacity in which further increment in olr deteriorates the digestion system this reflects the occurrence of anaerobic inhibition in the system 58 the introduction of higher feeding volume to the digester may result in shock loading to the microorganisms consequently the activity of methanogens are unable to accommodate the high olr in addition competition for substrate may exists from hydrolysis and acidification bacteria as a result superfluous volatile fatty acids vfa accumulate over time resulting in intense inhibition and process instability an increase in effluent vfa further raises the cod level fig 6 emphasizes on the effect of recycle ratio of sludge on various cost elements the annualised capital cost acc was determined based on capital cost following eq 3 59 it has been assumed that the fractional interest i of 0 07 for a period n of 5 years the net expenditure on the other hand is given as the summation of the acc and aoc annual operating cost and their difference with the total revenue eq 4 the latter is mainly contributed by the sales of biogas 3 a c c c a p i t a l c o s t i 1 i n 1 i n 1 where i fractional interest rate per year n number of years 4 n e t e x p e n d i t u r e a c c a o c t o t a l r e v e n u e for this case a steady increment is observed for the annualised capital cost and total revenue while the operating cost encounters a constant decrement this signifies an inverse relationship between capital and operating costs similarly in previous case all graphs encounter a change in trend in which both capital and operating costs experience a sharp increase at the recycle ratio of sludge of approximately 80 on the other hand a sudden drop is witnessed for the total revenue at the recycle ratio of 65 as the olr increases the size of the equipment ensues to accommodate higher flow capacity resulting in higher capital investment on the contrary since recycle of sludge reduces both raw material i e polymer for discharge pond cl 101 requirement and waste generation ap emission stream a lower operating cost is presumed the sudden increase in operating cost can be associated with the inhibition of digestion process as explained above leading to more waste produced and subsequently increases the cost for waste treatment and utilities the net expenditure was computed using eq 2 as stated above it is observed that a minimum value of 11 812 yr was recorded at 30 recycle ratio of sludge irvan et al 60 conducted a study on the effect of recycle sludge on the biogas production from pome the authors present a finding in which at 34 of recycle sludge the performance of the digestion system is enhanced with 82 improvement on volatile solid vs decomposition and 81 of cod removal efficiency is achieved another related study 58 investigated the effect of different sludge recycling rate of 6 12 and 18 m3 day on methane production and cod removal efficiency the paper shows an initial increase in methane production but reduces upon reaching 18 m3 day of sludge recycle in which higher application of olr is observed on the contrary the cod removal efficiency remained stable at which up to 95 is attained in this study the relationship between recycle ratio of sludge and methane production demonstrated similar results as reported in previous work 58 the effect of recycle ratio of sludge on various cost elements presented indicates the optimum point lies at 30 showing results comparable to the ones reported by irvan et al 60 hence it is justified that the optimal recycle ratio of sludge is achieved at 30 at which high production of methane with low effluent cod is achieved while considering the trade off between capital and operating cost in summary a balance between substrate concentration and the availability of microorganisms has to be realised for optimal digester operation note that the optimum recycle ratio of sludge in this study is not universal as it is dependent on factors such as operating condition process configurations and economic parameters 4 4 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the effect of the unit price of individual revenue stream on the total revenue fig 7 demonstrates the distribution of total revenue based on earnings gained from individual streams the total revenue is most susceptible to changes in the profits yielded from biogas which contributes a majority of 69 of the total revenue the sensitivity of individual stream on the total revenue is further explored by varying the value of each stream at 20 180 from unit base price as shown in fig 8 biogas exhibits the most significant shift towards total revenue whereby only gradual shifts are observed for carbon credit and dried sludge this signifies biogas as the major contributor to the overall profits gain therefore one of the few key aspects in reviewing the degree of feasibility and profitability of pome to biogas production is the market value of biogas another sensitivity analysis is also performed to analyse the fluctuation of cod and bod values of pome inlet stream on its effect of the discharge effluent quality this is done by switching the simulation model to rating mode 15 doing so means that the converged simulation model will be tested for its robustness as shown in fig 9 the discharge effluent will experience slight increase of its cod values to 25 ppm when the cod value of the pome inlet rises to 75 000 mg l from the base case value of 62 000 mg l similar trend is observed in fig 10 as the bod values of discharge effluent increases gradually to 10 2 mg l still well below the limit with the increase of bod value of pome inlet to 31 000 mg l from 26 800 mg l of base case in practise most palm oil mills will have a discharge pond to absorb this slight fluctuation before the final effluent is discharged to the environment 5 conclusion a study on biogas production from pome treatment via covered lagoon was successfully accomplished by means of a simulation tool namely superpro designer v9 0 this study validated the feasibility of biogas capture through anaerobic treatment of pome the simulation results indicate that bod and cod removal are up to the desired values in this study for a 42 000 kg h of pome feed 1 358 34 kg h of biogas was generated as equivalent to 29 m3 of biogas produced per tonne of pome economic evaluation has proven the plant to be financially feasible and sustainable the plant is projected to provide npv 7 interest of 2 830 000 and irr of 14 3 within a payback period of 4 66 years process optimisation was conducted based on a case study on recycle ratio of sludge the optimisation results reveal that the optimal recycle ratio of sludge should be set to 30 despite that it does not correspond to the highest methane production which occurs at the recycle ratio of 70 the most significant factor affecting the feasibility and profitability of the system turned out to be the market value of biogas the robustness of the present work is further validated as the system remained at acceptable fluctuations in response to the volatility in feed future studies can be focused on investigating the effects of parameters such as ph temperature and hydraulic retention time hrt on methane production cod removal efficiency and economic feasibility another future exploration can consider the incorporation of second recycle loop at the aerobic pond effluent to examine the trade off between two recycle loops to achieve the optimum system performance and cost expenditure declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a table a1 shows the characteristic of pome in

13777,in the present study three different real wastewaters containing high boron concentration between 2500 6200 mg lt were treated using the vacuum assisted air gap membrane distillation va agmd system through the use of polypropylene with a pore size of 0 20 μm pp 0 20 polypropylene with a pore size of 0 45 μm pp 0 45 polytetrafluoroethylene with a pore size 0 20 μm ptfe 0 20 and polytetrafluoroethylene with a pore size 0 45 μm ptfe 0 45 the impact of variable parameters including vacuum pressure boron concentration membrane material and membrane pore size on the va agmd system performance were examined firstly experiments were conducted with saline water 1 w v to stabilize the va agmd experiments were then carried out with three different real wastewaters in the va agmd system to discover the impact of vacuum pressure on the va agmd system four different vacuum pressures 0 02 0 04 0 06 and 0 08 bar were studied furthermore to test the effect of both pore size and membrane material on the va agmd system performance pp 0 20 pp 0 45 ptfe 0 20 and ptfe 0 45 membranes were used the results demonstrate that boron was removed above 99 in all conditions for all wastewaters as a result when boron concentrations at feed wastewater and vacuum pressure were increased permeate water fluxes increased for nearly all of the conditions it was concluded that permeate water flux was enhanced with increasing pore size and the highest permeate water flux was obtained by using pp membranes for all wastewaters keywords vacuum assisted air gap membrane distillation va agmd membrane distillation permeate water flux removal of boron 1 introduction boron which is trivalent semimetal is commonly found as boric acid borate and perborates in natural water 1 3 while the average boron concentration is about 10 mg l in the earth s crust the average boron concentration in seawater is 4 6 4 7 mg l furthermore boron concentration can be seen to be varied from 0 3 to 100 mg l in groundwater 2 4 approximately 73 4 of worldwide boron resources which are used in several industrial areas from the chemical industry to the nuclear industry are located in turkey the boron resources known in turkey are in particular located in kütahya emet eskişehir kırka bursa kestelek and balıkesir bigadiç 3 5 6 since boron is a crucial element for plants humans and animals it has a considerable impact on the environment boron can cause detrimental effects based on both the frequency and extent of the exposure on humans plants and animals 4 7 particularly for plants excess of boron can be harmful in the presence of high amounts of boron the leaves and fruits become covered with yellow spots and then die 8 similarly the boron concentration in drinking water should not exceed 2 4 mg l according to the world health organization who 4 otherwise the excessive levels of boron in drinking water and or food can be toxic to the organism damaging the nervous system skin liver kidney reproduction and digestive systems 8 thus depending on the intended use of water water wastewater with exceeding the determined boron content can cause serious environmental and health issues wastewater with high boron and ion content used in this study negatively affects agriculture due to the irrigation in a near basin therefore water wastewater which has high boron concentrations should be treated before being used for any purpose boron removal methods consist of electrocoagulation and membrane filtration techniques such as the ion exchange ultrafiltration hybrid method reverse osmosis membrane distillation coagulation and flocculation adsorption and adsorption co precipitation 9 16 among various boron treatment methods membrane distillation is an attractive and emerging method to removed wastewater containing high boron content lin et al studied boron removal with seawater which has high turbidity using chemical oxo precipitation cop they used h2o2 as an oxidant and used fecl3 and bacl2 as coagulants they mentioned that both coagulants were not compatible with the coagulation of seawater in cop also they did not find any remarkable impact on the boron removal by cop performance 17 dolati et al examined boron removal performance using the electrocoagulation method in aqueous solution which included low concentrations of boron in their study while initial boron concentration was 100 mg l 70 boron removal efficiency was obtained under ph 8 reaction time 60 min electrode distance 10 mm current density 5 5 ma cm2 they expressed that the electrocoagulation process can be performed for boron removal in water wastewater when initial boron concentration was more than 50 mg l 18 boron removal from water by reverse osmosis was evaluated by cengeloglu et al they used three different reverse osmosis membranes bw 30 filmtec swhr and ag ge osmonics they stated that boron removal can occur effectively only with feed waters of ph 11 additionally they obtained 99 removal boron efficiency through the use of swhr reverse osmosis membranes 19 jiang et al conducted research about the removal of boron with high level boric acid content from aqueous solutions via continuous electrodeionization cedi they reported that the removal of boron efficiency decreased from 45 to 16 with increasing feed boron concentration from 60 to 400 mg l also they also mentioned that the boron removal efficiency was 26 at ph 10 which is the optimum ph 20 there were mostly study that investigated removal of boron from wastewater that included lower boron concentration compared to this study in the literature 21 23 also there were a few studies about the removal of boron from wastewater that included high boron content but these wastewaters have lower ion concentrations compared to this study 24 25 wastewaters used in this study have both high boron and high ion content boron and ion content especially sulfate can cause damage to environment 26 27 therefore this is an essential study regarding examining the removal of boron from real wastewaters with high boron and ion content membrane distillation md is a thermally driven membrane process in this process water vapour molecules from feed water wastewater vaporize and are carried out by the hydrophobic membrane via vapour pressure difference 20 21 the md process is proficient to accomplish 100 rejection of non volatile solutes and produce high quality permeate water contrary to pressure driven membrane processes like ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis md is less sensitive to salinity since vapour pressure is less affected by salinity 29 32 moreover md has less fouling tendency that is caused to flux decline compared to pressure driven membrane process such as nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro 33 for instance caso4 can be caused by critical scaling problems in ro applications 34 while feed water pretreatment is not required for the md process for the pressure driven processes such as ro pretreatment can be required 35 there are four main configurations of md these configurations are sweeping gas membrane distillation sgmd air gap membrane distillation agmd vacuum membrane distillation vmd and direct contact membrane distillation dcmd 36 air gap membrane distillation agmd is one of the configurations of membrane distillation agmd consists of an air gap and condensation layer inside the membrane module 37 although this air gap causes increased mass transfer resistance and reduces flux an air gap with an insulation function decreases heat loss and temperature polarization 38 40 vacuum membrane distillation vmd that is another md configuration has a driving force that is generated through vacuum at the permeate side 41 as compared to other membrane distillation processes higher permeate water flux can be obtained as vmd allows higher partial pressure gradients 42 additionally vmd has significant advantages such as a diminished mass transfer resistance and a very low conductive loss of heat 43 there are several membrane distillation studies in the literature most of them belong to only one configuration in this study we tried to combine two membrane distillation system features we worked with the air gap membrane distillation system to use the insulation function that decreases heat loss and temperature polarization of the air gap at the same time we aimed to reduce the resistance on the permeate water flux due to the air gap by adding vacuum to the system in order to improve process efficiency for md systems other important issue is an investigation of operating parameters such as vacuum pressure feed temperature air gap feed flow rate baubakri et al investigated the effect of operating parameters such as temperature feed salt concentration in membrane distillation systems experiments carried out temperature ranged between 35 and 75 c and nacl concentration from 0 to 40 g l when the temperature increased they observed an increase in water flux and achieved the highest flux at 75 c permeate water flux slightly decreased with increasing salt concentration 44 xu et al investigated md performance under various operating parameters such as feed flow velocities feed temperature when the feed flow velocity increased permeate water flux slightly enhanced owing to the reduction of the polarization at the membrane surface and the temperature difference effect across the membrane at an increasing temperature from 50 c to 80 c the permeate water flux was significantly increased independently of the membrane material also they obtained that pp membranes have higher flux than ptfe and pvdf membranes 45 liu et al researched the effect of vacuum pressure on vacuum assisted air gap membrane distillation system system performance improves with increasing vacuum pressure due to the enhancement of vapor pressure difference 46 in this study vacuum was added to the system through a vacuum pump to develop the agmd system performance the applied system is known as a vacuum assisted air gap membrane distillation va agmd system the performance of va agmd for boron removal from wastewaters was examined during this work this study is aimed to remove boron from wastewater with high boron content from byproducts at boron production process and from underground sources by using the va agmd system the impacts of parameters such as vacuum pressure boron concentration pore size and membrane material were evaluated on boron removal efficiency and permeate water flux 2 materials and method 2 1 experimental setup a view of the lab scale vacuum assisted air gap membrane distillation va agmd experimental set up is given schematically in fig 1 the initial volume of feed wastewater was 2 0 l the feed water was warmed to the desired temperature with the temperature water bath and then distributed through the membrane module with a cycle water pump after evaporating in the module the warm concentrate flowed back to the feed tank during va agmd process the permeate part of the flat sheet membrane module was collected to the permeate bottle that was linked to a vacuum pump and measured to calculate the permeate water flux vacuum pressure was gauged by a vacuum pressure meter the membrane used was a hydrophobic porous flat sheet and was provided by the sterlitech company the effective membrane area was 44 18 cm2 2 2 experimental procedure and operation parameters three different types of real wastewater which have different contents and boron concentrations were used in this study these wastewaters were real wastewater 1 rw 1 that has boron content of 2598 mg l and ph 7 25 real wastewater 2 rw 2 that has boron content of 2795 mg l and ph 7 10 and real wastewater 3 rw 3 that has boron content of 6242 mg l and ph 3 45 also these wastewaters were taken from the eti mine general directorate emet boron works in kütahya turkey the other characteristics of these wastewaters were presented in the previous study 42 in this study a vacuum assisted air gap membrane distillation va agmd system was used vacuum pressure was in the range of 0 02 to 0 08 bar hydrophobic commercial membranes comprised of polypropylene pp and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe materials were utilized during batch experiments operated for 30 min properties of these membranes and clear scanning electron microscope sem images were given in table 1 and fig 2 respectively in this investigation the optimization data taken from the study of ozbey unal et al is used and presented in table 2 47 the feed water is heated and pumped to the top part of the membrane cell and maintained at a constant temperature of 70 c by a thermostat connected to the feed reservoir also the cooling water temperature was kept constant at 25 c and circulated to the bottom cell compartment 2 3 performance assessment of va agmd process the permeate water flux for va agmd system j kg m2 h and l m2 h is reported with the following equation 2 3 49 1 j δ w a δ t where δw is the weight of collected permeate water kg a is the active membrane area m2 and δt is the running time the boron rejection performance efficiency r is measured by the following equation 48 49 2 r c f c p c f x 100 where cf is the initial boron concentration for feed water and cp is the boron concentration for permeate water mass transfer of the membrane distillation process can be controlled with three mechanisms poiseuille flow molecular diffusion and knudsen diffusion according to dusty gas model the prominent mass transfer mechanism can be stated through calculating knudsen number kn which is defined as the mean free path to membrane pores size proportion knudsen number calculated by the following equation 3 k n λ d where λ is the mean free path and d is pore diameter of membrane 50 52 when kn is less than 0 01 kn 0 01 that is defined as a continuum region mass transfer transport is managed by molecular diffusion 53 54 when kn is more than 1 kn 1 that is defined as knudsen region vapor molecules have a larger mean free path compared to the membrane pore size it means that the molecule pore wall collisions predominate compared to molecule molecule collision 54 when kn varies from 0 01 to 1 0 01 kn 1 that is defined as transition region the collisions between water molecules happen in the membrane pore and diffusion happen between molecules of air 53 54 also since vmd systems only have water vapor diffusing into the pores the predominant knudsen diffusion can be considered dominant in this system because it is the vacuum pressure that provides the force that causes mass transfer in this system 55 2 4 boron and ion concentrations measurement in feed and permeate water optima 7000 dv inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrophotometers icp oes device supplied by perkin elmer was used for measurement of boron concentration in measurements calibration solutions were prepared from 1000 ppm standard boron solution brand inorganic ventures both calibration solutions and sample dilutions were prepared with 3 nitric acid 3 nitric acid solution was prepared by using 65 concentrated hno3 and ultrapure water merck 5 different calibration points and boron wavelength of 249 677 nm were used in the measurements all samples were measured in triplicate and standard deviations are recorded ion chromatography ic was used for the measurement of ion concentrations the equipment used was a dionex model ics 3000 ion chromatograph fitted with a 25 μl loop ionpac ag19 as19 and cg12a cs12a columns aers 500 and csrs 500 4 mm suppressors conductivity detector and as40 autosampler the analysis was operated at 30 c the anion eluent was 0 5 m of naco3 and the cation eluent was 19 mm of methanesulfonic acid msa the eluent flow rate was 1 ml min all reagents used were analytical grade 3 results and discussions 3 1 va agmd tests with synthetic saline water the vacuum assisted air gap membrane distillation system under vacuum pressure of 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 bar was stabilized with a ptfe membrane which is fabricated commercially and has a mean pore size of 0 45 μm before operating the va agmd system with higher salinity water a feed solution 1 w v nacl solution was introduced the average permeate flux variation for va agmd system with increasing vacuum pressures from 0 02 to 0 08 bar is presented in fig 3 due to the increase of vacuum pressure in the va agmd system the permeate flux for saline water increased the reason could be due to the enhancement in the transmembrane drive force associated with increasing vacuum pressure findings by shao et al corroborates results in our work 56 furthermore the performance of salt removal efficiency was obtained at 98 for all vacuum pressures 3 2 va agmd tests with real wastewaters to observe clearly evaluation of the performance of the lab scale va agmd system for real wastewaters which have high boron contents and the impact of vacuum pressure membrane pore size and membrane material on the permeation flux were examined the results are given in fig 4 and the values obtained are interpreted in detail in the following sections to determine the impact of vacuum pressure in the va agmd system on permeate water flux the experiments were performed with various vacuum pressures from 0 02 to 0 08 bar the variation of permeate water flux for all wastewaters depending on changing vacuum pressure at inlet temperature of 70 c for feed water and flow rate of 1 4 l min for feed water is presented in fig 4a c when vacuum pressure was raised permeate water flux was enhanced while the average permeate water flux was found to be 46 14 l m2 h at 0 04 bar by using pp 0 20 membrane for rw 2 the average permeate water flux at 0 06 bar was 82 36 l m2 h zhu et al expressed that the cause for the rise could be the effect of mass transfer driving force such as trans membrane vapor pressure disparity 57 it is understood that the water flux increases proportionally due to the increase in the applied force on the membranes this result is in consistent with the conclusions stated in the previous studies 58 59 the impact of boron concentration under conditions where the vacuum pressure and membrane type are constant on the permeate water flux was examined in the lab scale va agmd system in fig 4a c permeate water flux decreased with a rise in the boron concentration of almost all feed wastewater at constant vacuum pressure and membrane type naidu et al stated that the water vapor pressure declines with rising feed salt concentration this decrease of vapor pressure can be explained by the following equation according to raoult s law 60 4 ps 1 xi pv where ps is the partial vapor pressure of water in pa at the same temperature xi is the solute mole fraction in the bulk liquid pv is the vapor pressure of pure water at the feed temperature in pa furthermore with the increase of salinity in the feed water a concentration boundary layer will be formed adjacent to the membrane surface concentration polarization when this layer combines with the temperature boundary layer the driving force will decrease this decrease of driving force is caused a decrease of permeate flux 61 at the same time as the driving force for water to evaporate decreases lower permeate water fluxes are obtained with rising salt concentration 62 xu et al stated that when the salt concentration in feed water was greater than 80 g l the permeate water flux can be decreased 45 additionally the increase of boron concentration may result in the flux to decrease and membrane fouling depending on the increase in the ambient matrix density there is a similar trend to what was obtained in previous works 24 56 58 in some cases flux does not decrease with increasing boron concentration this can be explained by the fact that rw 2 and rw 3 have different ph because ph change affects boron form 63 in addition ptfe and pp membranes are ph sensitive the ph difference between the wastewaters affects the membrane material and the flux may differ 64 65 sem images of membrane samples at the end of the va agmd experiments for each wastewater are given in fig 5 a c it can be seen from these sem images that some salt crystals accumulated on the membrane surface but these salt crystals did not entirely cover the whole membrane surface in addition images of surface analysis of these salt crystals were analyzed for each wastewater using sem edx scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray this analysis is shown in figs 6 8 for rw 1 rw 2 and rw 3 respectively boron concentration of permeate water for each wastewater are displayed in table 3 table 4 shows concentrations of ion in the permeate water for each wastewater it was noted that the performance of boron removal efficiency could be over 99 for all wastewaters membranes and vacuum pressures moreover boron rejection was found to be similar for each parameter regardless of the amount of boron concentration in the wastewater the effect of membrane pore size was examined using two membranes that have various pore sizes 0 20 and 0 45 μm on permeate flux these membrane materials were pp and ptfe permeate water fluxes were increased with an increase of membrane pore size while the average permeate water flux using ptfe 0 20 was 106 95 l m2 h at vacuum pressure of 0 08 bar for rw 3 the average permeate water flux with ptfe 0 45 was 135 23 l m2 h at vacuum pressure of 0 08 bar for rw 3 mass transfer was enhanced with increasing membrane pore size this causes vapor permeability to increase 45 furthermore as the increment of pore size affects permeate coefficient positively permeate water flux increases 66 to evaluate the impact of membrane material on the permeate water flux in the va agmd system experiment sets were performed with two various of membrane material which are pp and ptfe membranes in fig 4a c average permeate water flux for pp membranes shows higher flux than for ptfe membranes at constant vacuum pressure and membrane pore size for nearly all wastewaters mericq et al 67 used pp membrane in a vmd system for seawater reverse osmosis brines and safavi and mohammadi 68 used ptfe membranes in a vmd system for desalination of high salinity water results showed that pp membranes had higher flux than ptfe membranes also membrane thickness is an important property in terms of flux in md systems because membrane thickness inversely correlated to membrane permeability since thicker membrane provides less heat conduction to the other side of the membrane the mass and heat transfer are decreased 69 70 as it can be seen from sem images and membrane properties since the thickness of pp membranes is less than the thickness of ptfe membranes pores of pp membrane consist of less stagnant air this causes a decrease in the molecular diffusion mechanism on the membrane and allows more water interference to the pore diameter 47 4 conclusions the va agmd experimental study was carried out for boron removal performance for three different real wastewaters with high boron concentrations the major results can be summarized as follows the permeate water flux rises with increased vacuum pressure from 0 02 to 0 08 bar due to mass driving force such as transmembrane steam pressure difference since the driving force to evaporate decreases permeate water flux decrease with rising boron concentration when the pore size increases the permeate water flux increases owing to the enhanced mass transfer in the pores pp 0 45 has the highest permeate water flux for nearly all of wastewaters and vacuum pressure performance of boron removal efficiency was over 99 for all wastewater all membranes and all vacuum pressure declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment this study was supported by the eti mine general directorate emet boron works kütahya turkey 
13777,in the present study three different real wastewaters containing high boron concentration between 2500 6200 mg lt were treated using the vacuum assisted air gap membrane distillation va agmd system through the use of polypropylene with a pore size of 0 20 μm pp 0 20 polypropylene with a pore size of 0 45 μm pp 0 45 polytetrafluoroethylene with a pore size 0 20 μm ptfe 0 20 and polytetrafluoroethylene with a pore size 0 45 μm ptfe 0 45 the impact of variable parameters including vacuum pressure boron concentration membrane material and membrane pore size on the va agmd system performance were examined firstly experiments were conducted with saline water 1 w v to stabilize the va agmd experiments were then carried out with three different real wastewaters in the va agmd system to discover the impact of vacuum pressure on the va agmd system four different vacuum pressures 0 02 0 04 0 06 and 0 08 bar were studied furthermore to test the effect of both pore size and membrane material on the va agmd system performance pp 0 20 pp 0 45 ptfe 0 20 and ptfe 0 45 membranes were used the results demonstrate that boron was removed above 99 in all conditions for all wastewaters as a result when boron concentrations at feed wastewater and vacuum pressure were increased permeate water fluxes increased for nearly all of the conditions it was concluded that permeate water flux was enhanced with increasing pore size and the highest permeate water flux was obtained by using pp membranes for all wastewaters keywords vacuum assisted air gap membrane distillation va agmd membrane distillation permeate water flux removal of boron 1 introduction boron which is trivalent semimetal is commonly found as boric acid borate and perborates in natural water 1 3 while the average boron concentration is about 10 mg l in the earth s crust the average boron concentration in seawater is 4 6 4 7 mg l furthermore boron concentration can be seen to be varied from 0 3 to 100 mg l in groundwater 2 4 approximately 73 4 of worldwide boron resources which are used in several industrial areas from the chemical industry to the nuclear industry are located in turkey the boron resources known in turkey are in particular located in kütahya emet eskişehir kırka bursa kestelek and balıkesir bigadiç 3 5 6 since boron is a crucial element for plants humans and animals it has a considerable impact on the environment boron can cause detrimental effects based on both the frequency and extent of the exposure on humans plants and animals 4 7 particularly for plants excess of boron can be harmful in the presence of high amounts of boron the leaves and fruits become covered with yellow spots and then die 8 similarly the boron concentration in drinking water should not exceed 2 4 mg l according to the world health organization who 4 otherwise the excessive levels of boron in drinking water and or food can be toxic to the organism damaging the nervous system skin liver kidney reproduction and digestive systems 8 thus depending on the intended use of water water wastewater with exceeding the determined boron content can cause serious environmental and health issues wastewater with high boron and ion content used in this study negatively affects agriculture due to the irrigation in a near basin therefore water wastewater which has high boron concentrations should be treated before being used for any purpose boron removal methods consist of electrocoagulation and membrane filtration techniques such as the ion exchange ultrafiltration hybrid method reverse osmosis membrane distillation coagulation and flocculation adsorption and adsorption co precipitation 9 16 among various boron treatment methods membrane distillation is an attractive and emerging method to removed wastewater containing high boron content lin et al studied boron removal with seawater which has high turbidity using chemical oxo precipitation cop they used h2o2 as an oxidant and used fecl3 and bacl2 as coagulants they mentioned that both coagulants were not compatible with the coagulation of seawater in cop also they did not find any remarkable impact on the boron removal by cop performance 17 dolati et al examined boron removal performance using the electrocoagulation method in aqueous solution which included low concentrations of boron in their study while initial boron concentration was 100 mg l 70 boron removal efficiency was obtained under ph 8 reaction time 60 min electrode distance 10 mm current density 5 5 ma cm2 they expressed that the electrocoagulation process can be performed for boron removal in water wastewater when initial boron concentration was more than 50 mg l 18 boron removal from water by reverse osmosis was evaluated by cengeloglu et al they used three different reverse osmosis membranes bw 30 filmtec swhr and ag ge osmonics they stated that boron removal can occur effectively only with feed waters of ph 11 additionally they obtained 99 removal boron efficiency through the use of swhr reverse osmosis membranes 19 jiang et al conducted research about the removal of boron with high level boric acid content from aqueous solutions via continuous electrodeionization cedi they reported that the removal of boron efficiency decreased from 45 to 16 with increasing feed boron concentration from 60 to 400 mg l also they also mentioned that the boron removal efficiency was 26 at ph 10 which is the optimum ph 20 there were mostly study that investigated removal of boron from wastewater that included lower boron concentration compared to this study in the literature 21 23 also there were a few studies about the removal of boron from wastewater that included high boron content but these wastewaters have lower ion concentrations compared to this study 24 25 wastewaters used in this study have both high boron and high ion content boron and ion content especially sulfate can cause damage to environment 26 27 therefore this is an essential study regarding examining the removal of boron from real wastewaters with high boron and ion content membrane distillation md is a thermally driven membrane process in this process water vapour molecules from feed water wastewater vaporize and are carried out by the hydrophobic membrane via vapour pressure difference 20 21 the md process is proficient to accomplish 100 rejection of non volatile solutes and produce high quality permeate water contrary to pressure driven membrane processes like ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis md is less sensitive to salinity since vapour pressure is less affected by salinity 29 32 moreover md has less fouling tendency that is caused to flux decline compared to pressure driven membrane process such as nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro 33 for instance caso4 can be caused by critical scaling problems in ro applications 34 while feed water pretreatment is not required for the md process for the pressure driven processes such as ro pretreatment can be required 35 there are four main configurations of md these configurations are sweeping gas membrane distillation sgmd air gap membrane distillation agmd vacuum membrane distillation vmd and direct contact membrane distillation dcmd 36 air gap membrane distillation agmd is one of the configurations of membrane distillation agmd consists of an air gap and condensation layer inside the membrane module 37 although this air gap causes increased mass transfer resistance and reduces flux an air gap with an insulation function decreases heat loss and temperature polarization 38 40 vacuum membrane distillation vmd that is another md configuration has a driving force that is generated through vacuum at the permeate side 41 as compared to other membrane distillation processes higher permeate water flux can be obtained as vmd allows higher partial pressure gradients 42 additionally vmd has significant advantages such as a diminished mass transfer resistance and a very low conductive loss of heat 43 there are several membrane distillation studies in the literature most of them belong to only one configuration in this study we tried to combine two membrane distillation system features we worked with the air gap membrane distillation system to use the insulation function that decreases heat loss and temperature polarization of the air gap at the same time we aimed to reduce the resistance on the permeate water flux due to the air gap by adding vacuum to the system in order to improve process efficiency for md systems other important issue is an investigation of operating parameters such as vacuum pressure feed temperature air gap feed flow rate baubakri et al investigated the effect of operating parameters such as temperature feed salt concentration in membrane distillation systems experiments carried out temperature ranged between 35 and 75 c and nacl concentration from 0 to 40 g l when the temperature increased they observed an increase in water flux and achieved the highest flux at 75 c permeate water flux slightly decreased with increasing salt concentration 44 xu et al investigated md performance under various operating parameters such as feed flow velocities feed temperature when the feed flow velocity increased permeate water flux slightly enhanced owing to the reduction of the polarization at the membrane surface and the temperature difference effect across the membrane at an increasing temperature from 50 c to 80 c the permeate water flux was significantly increased independently of the membrane material also they obtained that pp membranes have higher flux than ptfe and pvdf membranes 45 liu et al researched the effect of vacuum pressure on vacuum assisted air gap membrane distillation system system performance improves with increasing vacuum pressure due to the enhancement of vapor pressure difference 46 in this study vacuum was added to the system through a vacuum pump to develop the agmd system performance the applied system is known as a vacuum assisted air gap membrane distillation va agmd system the performance of va agmd for boron removal from wastewaters was examined during this work this study is aimed to remove boron from wastewater with high boron content from byproducts at boron production process and from underground sources by using the va agmd system the impacts of parameters such as vacuum pressure boron concentration pore size and membrane material were evaluated on boron removal efficiency and permeate water flux 2 materials and method 2 1 experimental setup a view of the lab scale vacuum assisted air gap membrane distillation va agmd experimental set up is given schematically in fig 1 the initial volume of feed wastewater was 2 0 l the feed water was warmed to the desired temperature with the temperature water bath and then distributed through the membrane module with a cycle water pump after evaporating in the module the warm concentrate flowed back to the feed tank during va agmd process the permeate part of the flat sheet membrane module was collected to the permeate bottle that was linked to a vacuum pump and measured to calculate the permeate water flux vacuum pressure was gauged by a vacuum pressure meter the membrane used was a hydrophobic porous flat sheet and was provided by the sterlitech company the effective membrane area was 44 18 cm2 2 2 experimental procedure and operation parameters three different types of real wastewater which have different contents and boron concentrations were used in this study these wastewaters were real wastewater 1 rw 1 that has boron content of 2598 mg l and ph 7 25 real wastewater 2 rw 2 that has boron content of 2795 mg l and ph 7 10 and real wastewater 3 rw 3 that has boron content of 6242 mg l and ph 3 45 also these wastewaters were taken from the eti mine general directorate emet boron works in kütahya turkey the other characteristics of these wastewaters were presented in the previous study 42 in this study a vacuum assisted air gap membrane distillation va agmd system was used vacuum pressure was in the range of 0 02 to 0 08 bar hydrophobic commercial membranes comprised of polypropylene pp and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe materials were utilized during batch experiments operated for 30 min properties of these membranes and clear scanning electron microscope sem images were given in table 1 and fig 2 respectively in this investigation the optimization data taken from the study of ozbey unal et al is used and presented in table 2 47 the feed water is heated and pumped to the top part of the membrane cell and maintained at a constant temperature of 70 c by a thermostat connected to the feed reservoir also the cooling water temperature was kept constant at 25 c and circulated to the bottom cell compartment 2 3 performance assessment of va agmd process the permeate water flux for va agmd system j kg m2 h and l m2 h is reported with the following equation 2 3 49 1 j δ w a δ t where δw is the weight of collected permeate water kg a is the active membrane area m2 and δt is the running time the boron rejection performance efficiency r is measured by the following equation 48 49 2 r c f c p c f x 100 where cf is the initial boron concentration for feed water and cp is the boron concentration for permeate water mass transfer of the membrane distillation process can be controlled with three mechanisms poiseuille flow molecular diffusion and knudsen diffusion according to dusty gas model the prominent mass transfer mechanism can be stated through calculating knudsen number kn which is defined as the mean free path to membrane pores size proportion knudsen number calculated by the following equation 3 k n λ d where λ is the mean free path and d is pore diameter of membrane 50 52 when kn is less than 0 01 kn 0 01 that is defined as a continuum region mass transfer transport is managed by molecular diffusion 53 54 when kn is more than 1 kn 1 that is defined as knudsen region vapor molecules have a larger mean free path compared to the membrane pore size it means that the molecule pore wall collisions predominate compared to molecule molecule collision 54 when kn varies from 0 01 to 1 0 01 kn 1 that is defined as transition region the collisions between water molecules happen in the membrane pore and diffusion happen between molecules of air 53 54 also since vmd systems only have water vapor diffusing into the pores the predominant knudsen diffusion can be considered dominant in this system because it is the vacuum pressure that provides the force that causes mass transfer in this system 55 2 4 boron and ion concentrations measurement in feed and permeate water optima 7000 dv inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrophotometers icp oes device supplied by perkin elmer was used for measurement of boron concentration in measurements calibration solutions were prepared from 1000 ppm standard boron solution brand inorganic ventures both calibration solutions and sample dilutions were prepared with 3 nitric acid 3 nitric acid solution was prepared by using 65 concentrated hno3 and ultrapure water merck 5 different calibration points and boron wavelength of 249 677 nm were used in the measurements all samples were measured in triplicate and standard deviations are recorded ion chromatography ic was used for the measurement of ion concentrations the equipment used was a dionex model ics 3000 ion chromatograph fitted with a 25 μl loop ionpac ag19 as19 and cg12a cs12a columns aers 500 and csrs 500 4 mm suppressors conductivity detector and as40 autosampler the analysis was operated at 30 c the anion eluent was 0 5 m of naco3 and the cation eluent was 19 mm of methanesulfonic acid msa the eluent flow rate was 1 ml min all reagents used were analytical grade 3 results and discussions 3 1 va agmd tests with synthetic saline water the vacuum assisted air gap membrane distillation system under vacuum pressure of 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 bar was stabilized with a ptfe membrane which is fabricated commercially and has a mean pore size of 0 45 μm before operating the va agmd system with higher salinity water a feed solution 1 w v nacl solution was introduced the average permeate flux variation for va agmd system with increasing vacuum pressures from 0 02 to 0 08 bar is presented in fig 3 due to the increase of vacuum pressure in the va agmd system the permeate flux for saline water increased the reason could be due to the enhancement in the transmembrane drive force associated with increasing vacuum pressure findings by shao et al corroborates results in our work 56 furthermore the performance of salt removal efficiency was obtained at 98 for all vacuum pressures 3 2 va agmd tests with real wastewaters to observe clearly evaluation of the performance of the lab scale va agmd system for real wastewaters which have high boron contents and the impact of vacuum pressure membrane pore size and membrane material on the permeation flux were examined the results are given in fig 4 and the values obtained are interpreted in detail in the following sections to determine the impact of vacuum pressure in the va agmd system on permeate water flux the experiments were performed with various vacuum pressures from 0 02 to 0 08 bar the variation of permeate water flux for all wastewaters depending on changing vacuum pressure at inlet temperature of 70 c for feed water and flow rate of 1 4 l min for feed water is presented in fig 4a c when vacuum pressure was raised permeate water flux was enhanced while the average permeate water flux was found to be 46 14 l m2 h at 0 04 bar by using pp 0 20 membrane for rw 2 the average permeate water flux at 0 06 bar was 82 36 l m2 h zhu et al expressed that the cause for the rise could be the effect of mass transfer driving force such as trans membrane vapor pressure disparity 57 it is understood that the water flux increases proportionally due to the increase in the applied force on the membranes this result is in consistent with the conclusions stated in the previous studies 58 59 the impact of boron concentration under conditions where the vacuum pressure and membrane type are constant on the permeate water flux was examined in the lab scale va agmd system in fig 4a c permeate water flux decreased with a rise in the boron concentration of almost all feed wastewater at constant vacuum pressure and membrane type naidu et al stated that the water vapor pressure declines with rising feed salt concentration this decrease of vapor pressure can be explained by the following equation according to raoult s law 60 4 ps 1 xi pv where ps is the partial vapor pressure of water in pa at the same temperature xi is the solute mole fraction in the bulk liquid pv is the vapor pressure of pure water at the feed temperature in pa furthermore with the increase of salinity in the feed water a concentration boundary layer will be formed adjacent to the membrane surface concentration polarization when this layer combines with the temperature boundary layer the driving force will decrease this decrease of driving force is caused a decrease of permeate flux 61 at the same time as the driving force for water to evaporate decreases lower permeate water fluxes are obtained with rising salt concentration 62 xu et al stated that when the salt concentration in feed water was greater than 80 g l the permeate water flux can be decreased 45 additionally the increase of boron concentration may result in the flux to decrease and membrane fouling depending on the increase in the ambient matrix density there is a similar trend to what was obtained in previous works 24 56 58 in some cases flux does not decrease with increasing boron concentration this can be explained by the fact that rw 2 and rw 3 have different ph because ph change affects boron form 63 in addition ptfe and pp membranes are ph sensitive the ph difference between the wastewaters affects the membrane material and the flux may differ 64 65 sem images of membrane samples at the end of the va agmd experiments for each wastewater are given in fig 5 a c it can be seen from these sem images that some salt crystals accumulated on the membrane surface but these salt crystals did not entirely cover the whole membrane surface in addition images of surface analysis of these salt crystals were analyzed for each wastewater using sem edx scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray this analysis is shown in figs 6 8 for rw 1 rw 2 and rw 3 respectively boron concentration of permeate water for each wastewater are displayed in table 3 table 4 shows concentrations of ion in the permeate water for each wastewater it was noted that the performance of boron removal efficiency could be over 99 for all wastewaters membranes and vacuum pressures moreover boron rejection was found to be similar for each parameter regardless of the amount of boron concentration in the wastewater the effect of membrane pore size was examined using two membranes that have various pore sizes 0 20 and 0 45 μm on permeate flux these membrane materials were pp and ptfe permeate water fluxes were increased with an increase of membrane pore size while the average permeate water flux using ptfe 0 20 was 106 95 l m2 h at vacuum pressure of 0 08 bar for rw 3 the average permeate water flux with ptfe 0 45 was 135 23 l m2 h at vacuum pressure of 0 08 bar for rw 3 mass transfer was enhanced with increasing membrane pore size this causes vapor permeability to increase 45 furthermore as the increment of pore size affects permeate coefficient positively permeate water flux increases 66 to evaluate the impact of membrane material on the permeate water flux in the va agmd system experiment sets were performed with two various of membrane material which are pp and ptfe membranes in fig 4a c average permeate water flux for pp membranes shows higher flux than for ptfe membranes at constant vacuum pressure and membrane pore size for nearly all wastewaters mericq et al 67 used pp membrane in a vmd system for seawater reverse osmosis brines and safavi and mohammadi 68 used ptfe membranes in a vmd system for desalination of high salinity water results showed that pp membranes had higher flux than ptfe membranes also membrane thickness is an important property in terms of flux in md systems because membrane thickness inversely correlated to membrane permeability since thicker membrane provides less heat conduction to the other side of the membrane the mass and heat transfer are decreased 69 70 as it can be seen from sem images and membrane properties since the thickness of pp membranes is less than the thickness of ptfe membranes pores of pp membrane consist of less stagnant air this causes a decrease in the molecular diffusion mechanism on the membrane and allows more water interference to the pore diameter 47 4 conclusions the va agmd experimental study was carried out for boron removal performance for three different real wastewaters with high boron concentrations the major results can be summarized as follows the permeate water flux rises with increased vacuum pressure from 0 02 to 0 08 bar due to mass driving force such as transmembrane steam pressure difference since the driving force to evaporate decreases permeate water flux decrease with rising boron concentration when the pore size increases the permeate water flux increases owing to the enhanced mass transfer in the pores pp 0 45 has the highest permeate water flux for nearly all of wastewaters and vacuum pressure performance of boron removal efficiency was over 99 for all wastewater all membranes and all vacuum pressure declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

13778,the expanding nuclear industry requires the effective elimination of radioactive wastes generated by nuclear power plant operation and nuclear disasters herein we demonstrate that tio2 photocatalysis can significantly increase the cs adsorption capacity of prussian blue pb revealing that in pb tio2 composites cs ions are adsorbed exclusively on pb cs adsorption capacity equaled 0 09 mmol gcomposite 1 in the dark and 0 75 mmol gcomposite 1 under uv light irradiation for the composite with a pb tio2 mass ratio of 5 5 being maximal at a pb tio2 mass ratio of 7 3 and the mechanism of photocatalytic cs adsorption enhancement was elucidated and discussed this enhancement was suppressed by high pb contents i e low tio2 contents because of the concomitant suppression of photogenerated electron transfer from tio2 to pb and was also hindered by the presence of k and na however the cs adsorption capacity of pb tio2 at high k concentrations under uv light irradiation was still almost twice as high as that observed in the dark the increase of cs adsorption capacity upon irradiation was ascribed to the concomitant reduction of pb by photogenerated electrons transferred from tio2 thus the present study provides a new direction for the development of next generation technologies for radioactive cs removal from contaminated water keywords cesium removal prussian blue tio2 photocatalytic reaction uv light 1 introduction the fraction of nuclear energy in the global energy production continues to increase 1 which results in a growing demand for technologies of treating radioactive wastes inevitably produced by nuclear power plant maintenance and repair thus radioactive waste management and disposal is a major challenge facing mankind the fukushima nuclear power plant accident due to an earthquake that hit northeastern japan in 2011 caused serious environmental problems releasing radioactive waste into the surrounding soil groundwater and the pacific ocean and highlighting the importance of radioactive waste removal technologies 2 the above accident released i cs and sr as the major radionuclides among them 137cs and 90sr are the most important radionuclides as their long half lives 30 years and high fission yields result in high contents in spent fuel and contaminated regions 3 137cs is a strong beta gamma emitter that undergoes high beta decay and emits high energy gamma radiation in addition cs mimics k and thus finds its way into food and the human body which makes the removal of 137cs from the environment a critical issue for public health and the safe management of radioactive waste 4 the removal and recovery of radioactive cs from radioactive wastewater can be performed in several ways e g by extraction precipitation ion exchange adsorption and membrane methods among them adsorption techniques feature the advantages of high efficiency and low cost and are commonly implemented using zeolites 5 6 crystalline silicotitanate 7 8 and metal ferrocyanides 9 11 for the selective adsorption of radioactive cs lee et al described the cs adsorption performances of mesoporous geopolymers containing nanocrystalline zeolites 12 crystalline silicotitanate is widely used for cs capture because of its commercial availability 8 13 although recent studies have also probed layered titanates with different morphologies nanotubes nanowires nanofibers and even nanoribbons 14 17 tungsten based materials include a large class of frameworks in which tungsten is associated with other compounds as exemplified by tungsten bronze based materials 18 zirconyl tungstate membranes 19 tungstate based glass 20 and thorium tungstophosphate 21 these structures feature high radiation resistance as well as good chemical stability and durability 18 22 prussian blue pb is a commercially available blue pigment known for its ability to selectively adsorb alkali metal cations such as cs with pb nanoparticles exhibiting the additional advantage of a very large surface area 23 25 the widespread use of radioactive cs adsorbents reported so far is limited by secondary environmental pollution due to the formation of difficult to recover nanoparticles after diffusion and accumulation 26 28 therefore the development of technologies of effectively supporting pb to facilitate its recovery from wastewater and increase its cs adsorption efficiency is a task of high practical significance the use of proper pb supports can result in synergistic effects to improve adsorption efficiency and overcome adsorbent application obstacles supports with high surface areas or magnetic properties such as zeolites graphene and magnetite have been applied to immobilize pb for post adsorption separation and recycling 29 34 previously we synthesized pb impregnated polyacrylonitrile nanofibers for the efficient removal of cs from radioactive wastewater 35 and demonstrated that the adsorption of radioactive cs on pb modified tio2 pb tio2 can be significantly enhanced by uv irradiation 36 although tio2 is a widely used effective support 37 that has been extensively studied as a photocatalyst 38 39 the application of related photocatalytic reactions for radioactive cs removal has not been explored which highlights the need to determine how the photocatalytic reactions of pb tio2 composites enhance their cs adsorption performance although our previous study reported the unprecedentedly enhanced cs adsorption caused by photocatalytic reactions it lacked sufficient physical and chemical evidence to unambiguously determine the reason of this enhanced adsorption herein we simply prepared pb tio2 composites from commercially available pb and tio2 and investigated their ability to remove cs via adsorption demonstrating that this ability is strongly enhanced by uv irradiation and depends on the pb tio2 ratio moreover we studied the physicochemical properties changes in pb tio2 occurring upon the increase in cs adsorption capacity under uv irradiation in addition we determined the effects of competing cations on cs adsorption performance and proposed detailed mechanisms of photocatalytic cs adsorption by pb tio2 2 experimental 2 1 materials cscl 99 9 sigma aldrich soluble pb k fe iii fe ii cn 6 sigma aldrich insoluble pb fe iii fe iii fe ii cn 6 3 sigma aldrich tio2 aeroxide p25

steered towards the liquid suspension over the atr plate for excitation of tio2 2 4 cs adsorption experiments cs adsorption experiments were performed in batch mode by dispersing pb tio2 5 g l 1 in distilled water which was followed by the addition of the desired amount of cs as a stock solution and 48 h stirring 300 rpm in the dark or under uv light irradiation to allow the adsorption of cs on pb tio2 the solution ph was around 4 and the experimental temperature equaled 20 25 c for uv light irradiation a 300 w xe arc lamp oriel was used as a light source and the light beam was passed through a 10 cm ir water filter a uv cutoff filter λ 295 nm and focused onto a cylindrical quartz reactor with a 40 mm diameter window before irradiation the reaction mixture was purged with n2 gas for 30 min to remove dissolved o2 that hindered the reaction of pb with tio2 sample aliquots were intermittently withdrawn by a 1 ml syringe and filtered through a 0 45 μm ptfe filter millipore in

pb tio2 composites fig 1 a illustrates the preparation of pb tio2 composites and fig 1 b shows their xrd patterns demonstrating that all signals were well matched with those of cubic pb jcpds 73 0687 anatase jcpds 21 1272 and rutile jcpds 21 1276 40 as expected the intensity of tio2 peaks decreased while that of pb peaks increased with increasing pb content and no impurity peaks were observed to further confirm that pb was dispersed on tio2 samples with pb tio2 mass ratios of 1 10 2 8 5 5 and 10 1 were probed by stem imaging and elemental mapping fig 1 c in the obtained elemental maps the distribution of pb corresponded to that of fe while the distribution of tio2 corresponded to that of ti both fe and ti were evenly distributed which was indicative of uniform pb mixing with tio2 fig s1 displays a low magnification tem image of pb tio2 showing the presence of pb nanoparticles with an average size of 50 100 nm and tio2 nanoparticles with an average size of 20 50 nm 3 2 cs adsorption performance of pb tio2 composites fig 2 presents the cs adsorption capacities per gcomposite of pb tio2 5 5 for various cs concentrations showing that saturation values of 0 09 and 0 75 mmol g 1 were obtained in the dark and under uv light irradiation respectively this enhanced adsorption capacity was comparable to that of previously reported pbs table s1 thus the cs adsorption capacity of pb tio2 was significantly enhanced by uv light irradiation previously we reported that the photodeposition of tio2 onto pb enhances the cs adsorption capacity of the latter by promoting photocatalytic reactions 36 moreover we also showed that additional cs adsorption by photocatalytic reaction can occur sequentially whereas in the present work an eight fold increase of maximum cs adsorption capacity was achieved subsequently we compared the effects of pb type and filtration on cs adsorption capacities fig 3 in the dark the adsorption capacity increased with increasing pb content whereas under uv light irradiation it increased with increasing pb content up to a pb tio2 mass ratio of 7 3 decreasing at higher ratios cs ions were possibly inserted into regular lattice spaces surrounded by cyanide bridged fe in the pb crystal structure mappings obtained before and after cs adsorption fig 4 indicate that the photo enhanced adsorption of cs occurred on pb but not on tio2 thus the efficiency of cs adsorption increased with increasing pb content because of the concomitantly increasing number of lattice sites capable of participating in the reaction the cs adsorption capacity of pb tio2 10 1 was slightly lower than that of pb tio2 7 3 which was ascribed to the fact that overly high pb contents i e overly low tio2 contents interfere with the transfer of photogenerated electrons from tio2 to pb thus the highest cs adsorption capacity was observed for soluble pb tio2 7 3 the enhancement of cs adsorption due to photocatalytic reactions was significantly affected by whether filtration or evaporation was employed unlike in the case of insoluble pb some soluble pb particles passed through the filter therefore the increased cs adsorption capacity observed for filtration produced soluble pb tio2 composites was ascribed to pb loss during filtration comparison of fig 3 b with fig 3 c shows that the photocatalytic reaction induced enhancement of cs adsorption was more pronounced for soluble pb kfe iii fe ii cn 6 than for insoluble pb fe iii fe iii fe ii cn 6 3 the unit cells of these pb types contain eight and seven fe atoms respectively and water molecules appear in the lattice defect sites cs ions are inserted into regular lattice spaces by simple physical adsorption via lattice defect sites and form ion pairs with pristine cations in the cages of pb crystal structure 41 42 in addition cs and k ions are exchanged within the crystal via a proton exchange mechanism 43 44 which results in a marked increase of cs adsorption capacity for soluble pb samples as soluble pb contains highly mobile k ions fig 3 c 3 3 evidence of pb reduction upon uv light irradiation as described above the cs adsorption capacity of pb tio2 is greatly increased by the photocatalytic reaction which involves the reduction of pb by photogenerated electrons transferred from tio2 pb reduction was investigated by monitoring changes in the oxidation state of fe by ft ir spectroscopy 45 the ft ir atr technique was employed to probe the mechanism of pb tio2 photoreduction in cscl solution photoreduction was induced by irradiation with a 355 nm laser and characterization was performed after different uv exposure times the ft ir spectrum of pristine pb fig 5 a featured a strong absorption band at 2090 cm 1 attributable to cn groups and did not contain signs of oxidation or reduction changes in the oxidation state of fe were determined by analysis of the ft ir spectrum of pb tio2 fig 5 b after 3 h uv light illumination the cn peak shifted from 2090 to 2077 cm 1 and lost intensity which was ascribed to the production of cyanide bridged equivalent fe ii ions within fe c n fe units during pb reduction the fe ii cn fe iii to fe ii cn fe ii transition was due to electron transfer from tio2 to pb similar results were obtained by taguchi et al 46 who probed the interaction between pb and cds to understand the mechanism of photoinduced magnetic phenomena according to these authors photoinduced electron transfer form cds to pb leads to the reduction of pb from fe ii cn fe iii to fe ii cn fe ii similarly yamamoto et al 47 used ft ir spectroscopy to study the photoinduced reduction of pb on tio2 nanosheets upon uv band gap excitation of tio2 exploiting the capability of tio2 to reduce heavy metals and degrade organic compounds prussian white pw the reduced version of pb contains two alkali metal ions per formula unit whereas pb contains one it was proposed that the photocatalytic effect of pb tio2 leads to the additional adsorption of cs due to pb reduction photogenerated electron transfer was evidenced by the color fading of the pb tio2 solution inset of fig 5 b which can be attributed to the reduction of fe iii to fe ii 48 during cs adsorption faded pb can be re oxidized upon exposure to air regaining its blue color 49 50 the photographs in fig 5 c show the color evolution of air exposed pb tio2 after cs adsorption revealing that although the blue color was regained the adsorbed cs ions were maintained at pb lattice sites the reduction state of pb tio2 after cs adsorption was determined by raman spectroscopy as this technique can easily detect pb fading based on the frequency of the cn stretching mode which depends on the oxidation state of the coordinated metal cations the cn peak evolution is presented in fig 5 c in which all spectra are normalized relative to this peak for comparative analysis the intensity of the higher frequency band at 2162 cm 1 assigned to the fe ii cn fe iii stretching vibration 51 remained unchanged upon uv light illumination the relative intensity of the shoulder at 2172 cm 1 corresponding to the fe ii cn fe ii stretching vibration increased after cs adsorption under 48 h uv light illumination 50 which indicated an increase in the amount of reduced fe ii cations and confirmed the partial photoreduction of pb to pw fig 5 d compares the xrd patterns of pb tio2 before and after cs adsorption revealing that the adsorbed cs ions were likely inserted into the pb lattice and were maintained in the crystal channels after adsorption 3 4 effects of competitive cations to analyze the practicality of the developed cs removal method we further investigated cs removal in the presence of competing cations fig 6 a that are commonly found in natural water na k ca2 and mg2 and can inhibit cs adsorption while the adsorption of cs on pb tio2 was not significantly influenced in the dark it was interrupted under uv light irradiation in the presence of k and na fig 6 b and c show the adsorption capacities of pb tio2 for competitor cations in the dark and under uv light irradiation respectively in the dark cs adsorption was not influenced by competitor cations however k could be adsorbed on pb without disturbing the adsorption of cs under uv light irradiation considerable amounts of k and na were adsorbed on pb tio2 while the adsorption of cs was interrupted this phenomenon was explained by considering the radii of hydrated ions which decreased in the order of mg2 0 428 nm ca2 0 412 nm na 0 358 nm k 0 331 nm 52 thus k ions featured the lowest hydrated radius and hence were most strongly electrostatically attracted to pb adsorption sites effectively inhibiting cs adsorption 53 54 moreover ions with small hydrated radii could approach surfaces more closely than those with large hydrated radii therefore cs adsorption was most strongly interrupted in the presence of k and na because of their small hydrated radii fig 7 a shows that the cs adsorption capacity of pb tio2 at cs 0 5 mm under uv light irradiation decreased with increasing k concentration to investigate the competitive effect of k we monitored the concentration change of k and cs after the reaction as the initial concentration of k increased so did the amount of k adsorbed on pb tio2 while the amount of adsorbed cs concomitantly decreased fig 7 b however at k concentrations above 10 mm the cs adsorption capacity of pb tio2 did not change and reached a saturation value of 0 17 mmol g 1 which was still higher than the maximum cs adsorption capacity observed in the dark 0 09 mmol g 1 3 5 proposed mechanisms based on the above results the photocatalytically enhanced adsorption of cs on pb tio2 was explained as follows scheme 1 cs adsorption selectively occurred in the pb lattice of the pb tio2 composite uv light irradiation of pb tio2 generated electrons and holes in the conduction and valence bands of tio2 respectively the photogenerated electrons were transferred to pb fe ii cn fe iii and reduced it to pw fe ii cn fe ii eqs 1 3 which was accompanied by the additional adsorption of cs thus we concluded that the dramatic increase of cs adsorption capacity upon uv light irradiation is well suited for reducing the amount of secondary wastes containing radioactive cs 1 tio2 hv λ 300 nm e h 2 h h2o oh h 3 e pb fe iii cn fe ii pw fe ii cn fe ii 4 conclusions herein we probed the morphology composition and cs adsorption capacity of pb tio2 composites revealing their high crystallinity tio2 content strongly influenced the photocatalytic performance of pb tio2 and cs adsorption capacity was maximized for pb tio2 7 3 this adsorption capacity enhancement was attributed to effective contact between pb and tio2 which facilitated the transport of photogenerated electrons from tio2 to pb and thus resulted in the reduction of the latter the photocatalytic adsorption of cs was mainly attributable to physical adsorption ion exchange and electrostatic interaction with the surface charge of pb tio2 as was verified by ft ir spectroscopy raman spectroscopy and xrd we further investigated the effects of competing cations on cs adsorption capacity although the enhancement of cs adsorption capacity upon uv light irradiation was inhibited by k and na this capacity exceeded that obtained in the dark almost two fold even at very high concentrations of k therefore the photocatalytic enhancement of cs adsorption capacity was concluded to hold great promise for the removal of radioactive cs from

13778,the expanding nuclear industry requires the effective elimination of radioactive wastes generated by nuclear power plant operation and nuclear disasters herein we demonstrate that tio2 photocatalysis can significantly increase the cs adsorption capacity of prussian blue pb revealing that in pb tio2 composites cs ions are adsorbed exclusively on pb cs adsorption capacity equaled 0 09 mmol gcomposite 1 in the dark and 0 75 mmol gcomposite 1 under uv light irradiation for the composite with a pb tio2 mass ratio of 5 5 being maximal at a pb tio2 mass ratio of 7 3 and the mechanism of photocatalytic cs adsorption enhancement was elucidated and discussed this enhancement was suppressed by high pb contents i e low tio2 contents because of the concomitant suppression of photogenerated electron transfer from tio2 to pb and was also hindered by the presence of k and na however the cs adsorption capacity of pb tio2 at high k concentrations under uv light irradiation was still almost twice as high as that observed in the dark the increase of cs adsorption capacity upon irradiation was ascribed to the concomitant reduction of pb by photogenerated electrons transferred from tio2 thus the present study provides a new direction for the development of next generation technologies for radioactive cs removal from contaminated water keywords cesium removal prussian blue tio2 photocatalytic reaction uv light 1 introduction the fraction of nuclear energy in the global energy production continues to increase 1 which results in a growing demand for technologies of treating radioactive wastes inevitably produced by nuclear power plant maintenance and repair thus radioactive waste management and disposal is a major challenge facing mankind the fukushima nuclear power plant accident due to an earthquake that hit northeastern japan in 2011 caused serious environmental problems releasing radioactive waste into the surrounding soil groundwater and the pacific ocean and highlighting the importance of radioactive waste removal technologies 2 the above accident released i cs and sr as the major radionuclides among them 137cs and 90sr are the most important radionuclides as their long half lives 30 years and high fission yields result in high contents in spent fuel and contaminated regions 3 137cs is a strong beta gamma emitter that undergoes high beta decay and emits high energy gamma radiation in addition cs mimics k and thus finds its way into food and the human body which makes the removal of 137cs from the environment a critical issue for public health and the safe management of radioactive waste 4 the removal and recovery of radioactive cs from radioactive wastewater can be performed in several ways e g by extraction precipitation ion exchange adsorption and membrane methods among them adsorption techniques feature the advantages of high efficiency and low cost and are commonly implemented using zeolites 5 6 crystalline silicotitanate 7 8 and metal ferrocyanides 9 11 for the selective adsorption of radioactive cs lee et al described the cs adsorption performances of mesoporous geopolymers containing nanocrystalline zeolites 12 crystalline silicotitanate is widely used for cs capture because of its commercial availability 8 13 although recent studies have also probed layered titanates with different morphologies nanotubes nanowires nanofibers and even nanoribbons 14 17 tungsten based materials include a large class of frameworks in which tungsten is associated with other compounds as exemplified by tungsten bronze based materials 18 zirconyl tungstate membranes 19 tungstate based glass 20 and thorium tungstophosphate 21 these structures feature high radiation resistance as well as good chemical stability and durability 18 22 prussian blue pb is a commercially available blue pigment known for its ability to selectively adsorb alkali metal cations such as cs with pb nanoparticles exhibiting the additional advantage of a very large surface area 23 25 the widespread use of radioactive cs adsorbents reported so far is limited by secondary environmental pollution due to the formation of difficult to recover nanoparticles after diffusion and accumulation 26 28 therefore the development of technologies of effectively supporting pb to facilitate its recovery from wastewater and increase its cs adsorption efficiency is a task of high practical significance the use of proper pb supports can result in synergistic effects to improve adsorption efficiency and overcome adsorbent application obstacles supports with high surface areas or magnetic properties such as zeolites graphene and magnetite have been applied to immobilize pb for post adsorption separation and recycling 29 34 previously we synthesized pb impregnated polyacrylonitrile nanofibers for the efficient removal of cs from radioactive wastewater 35 and demonstrated that the adsorption of radioactive cs on pb modified tio2 pb tio2 can be significantly enhanced by uv irradiation 36 although tio2 is a widely used effective support 37 that has been extensively studied as a photocatalyst 38 39 the application of related photocatalytic reactions for radioactive cs removal has not been explored which highlights the need to determine how the photocatalytic reactions of pb tio2 composites enhance their cs adsorption performance although our previous study reported the unprecedentedly enhanced cs adsorption caused by photocatalytic reactions it lacked sufficient physical and chemical evidence to unambiguously determine the reason of this enhanced adsorption herein we simply prepared pb tio2 composites from commercially available pb and tio2 and investigated their ability to remove cs via adsorption demonstrating that this ability is strongly enhanced by uv irradiation and depends on the pb tio2 ratio moreover we studied the physicochemical properties changes in pb tio2 occurring upon the increase in cs adsorption capacity under uv irradiation in addition we determined the effects of competing cations on cs adsorption performance and proposed detailed mechanisms of photocatalytic

treatment efficiency the results showed that treated water quality significantly improved from the inlet to the outlet with tss tds and tp reduced from 247 0 02 to 31 66 5 8 391 67 6 18 to 80 66 3 86 6 7 0 92 to 2 06 0 38 respectively similarly nh 4 n no 3 n and tn reduced from 22 2 94 to 9 8 1 96 73 67 4 99 to 27 0 7 12 and 94 4 08 to 38 33 4 11 respectively the result showed that highest performance variability was observed among the studied ssfcws the heavy metal concentration in the influent to effluent for pb cu and mn was reduced from 0 63 0 09 to 0 36 0 11 0 49 0 08 to 0 18 0 05 and 0 70 0 07 to 0 43 0 15 respectively this assessment has proved that a significant reduction of pollutants was observed using ssfcw treatments there is a need to encourage other floriculture industry to adopt and implement constructed wetland technology as a primary option to protect the environment and public health keywords constructed wetland nutrient removal heavy metal removal efficiency floriculture wastewater 1 introduction rapid agro industrialization and expansion of economic activities in developing countries are frequently associated with significant wastewater ww generation which requires effective and efficient treatment system before discharging in to the environment pollution of subsurface water spoils water ecosystem courses and pose ecological and public health risks in developing countries like ethiopia 1 2 this is due to population and economic growth which contributing to release of raw or moderately treated ww into the environment 2 in ethiopia agro industries are speedily rising with increased generation of wastewater to the water environment 2 among the agro industries floriculture is growing in developing countries such as ethiopia kenya tanzania and uganda 3 the floriculture by its nature requires high fertilizer and pesticide application which poses a potential treat in to the environment and human health 4 in 1997 ethiopian floriculture starts with just two flower farms but has grown to more than 80 flower farms in 2012 5 currently 84 floriculture industries are functioning in ethiopia and are the second largest flower producer and exporter in africa next to kenya 3 however it was increasingly coming under criticism for some of its social and environmental shortcomings due to wastewater discharge and its associated consequences because of poor management of waste and wastewater the sector produces about usd 200 million export with more than 85 000 jobs created 6 due to the government active facilitation and incentive scheme programme s in spite of the economic success floriculture industries have been blamed for excessive water use pollution and impacts on aquatic biodiversity 7 8 6 61 the wastewater discharge sources are pack houses where the plans are graded and packed for export the bio control agent houses laundry staff canteen overflow from irrigation farm and washing water the wastewater is frequently discharged into the aquatic environment rivers and lakes partially treated or untreated fostering eutrophication and dissolved oxygen depletion leading to the death of aquatic organisms 9 10 the ever increasing of contaminants from floriculture industry in ethiopia initiate the development of adoptive and cost effective technologies progressive wastewater treatment technologies are vital for the treatment of industrial wastewater to keep public health and to encounter water quality criteria for reuse the aquatic setting and for water reprocessing 11 cwt is mainly used as polishing treatment method for agro industrial wastewater treatment due to its simplicity and low cost 59 60 cwt is becoming more prevalent for post treatment of wastewater 24 cwt has a relatively low operating and maintenance costs it does not also rely on machinery or energy input 44 cwt has been applied and promoted for wastewater purification in many parts of the world and are highly suited to tropics due to favourable climate conditions 12 due to simplicity of technology the floriculture industries in ethiopia implemented cwt for its wastewater treatment constructed wasteland treatment efficiency is a function of environmental conditions and proper management 13 in order to establish the efficiency of cw systems various studies have been carried out on the removal of pathogens organic matter and nutrients in different wastewaters 10 14 62 most of the research done on cw efficiency have been carried out under temperature climate 15 to date limited research studies on the efficiencies of cw systems particularly under tropical conditions in africa have been reported 7 but its adoption and application of it has been growing since two decades 4 the need for long term monitoring to track efficiency trends especially in cws treating flower farm wastewater is of urgent need since information is currently lacking in ethiopia floriculture industry generate wastewater ww coming from different compartments but very often there is an assumption that such generated ww is rich in nutrients due to fertilizer application currently in ethiopia a comprehensive study has not been assessed on the efficiency of the cw system treating floriculture ww before discharging into the aquatic environment however a comprehensive study has not been conducted to assess on the efficiency of the cwt system in treating floriculture industry therefore the objective of this study was aimed at assessing the efficiency of ssfcwt in treating floriculture industry wastewater for heavy metal and physico chemical removal capability at seven floriculture industries 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description this study was conducted in ethiopia oromia regional state where the majority of flower farm industries is found oromia regional state is located at latitude 7 59 20 62 n longitude 39 22 52 25 e 7 59 20 6 n 39 22 52 3 e 7 989062 39 381180 the climate of the study area is varied across region due to varies topography the average annual temperature in the study area is ranges from 6 c to 36 c and rain fall ranges from 892 mm 33 inch to 1162 45 7 inch it is categorized with a moist tropical climate and extreme precipitation from june to august the remarkable features of the study area tropical climate are higher temperature year round plant growth and microbial activity which enhance higher nutrient removal in the cws there are rigorous agricultural undertakings with cattle grazing and setting up of floriculture industries in the nearby the effluent of the floriculture industries directly discharges to the river the studied floriculture industries are found within 60 km radius of the capital addis ababa except koka and ziway which are located 200 and 260 kms away from addis ababa respectively fig 1 2 2 constructed wetland design characteristics all the seven cw treating floriculture wastewater assessed in this study was using subsurface flow cws the average depth of the growth media was 0 25 0 6 m and the effluent level was 5 cm below the surface of the media for all ssfcw the volume varies depending on the size of the floriculture industry before actual sampling the hydraulic retention time was recorded m j and ko have 3 days hrt and et sh and dug have 5 days hrt the subsurface cws influent volume for m j ko aws et sh and dug was 11 38m3 day 13 18 m3 day 10 58 m3 day 10 28 m3 day 17 83 m3 day 14 39 m3 day 12 78 m3 day respectively the substrate used by all the seven cws was gravel and hard core at the inlet and outlet the cw plants used in all sampling cws were canna lilies typha latifolia and cypreus papyrus influent and effluent floriculture waste water were collected and analysed for heavy metal and physicochemical parameters 2 3 sample collection and wastewater quality analysis sample wastewater was taken from seven cws of the floriculture industries a sample of two litters of wastewater before and after constructed wetland treatment influent and effluent was taken using rinsed and washed plastic bottles from all sampled floriculture industries a three round sample was taken every 15 days from october 2019 to january 2020 comprehensive wastewater characterization was examined using american public health association 16 standards selected parameters such as total suspended solids tss total dissolved solids tds chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrite nitrogen no3 n sulfides s2 and sulfate so4 2 ph and tds were analysed using electrometric method using portable ph ec tds meter cod tss no3 n no2 n nh4 n tn and tp were analaysed using spectro meter dr3900 hack method in additon sulfate so4 2 sulfide s2 were analysed using spectrophotometer dr 2010 usa hach method heavy metals cu mn and pb analysis was performed using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas model analytical jena nova aa 400p germany following standard methods 16 the selected parameters performance efficiencies of the treatment system were calculated using the formula 1 r c i c f c i 100 where r removal efficiency in percent ci is the influent concentration mg l and cf is the effluent concentration mg l 2 4 statistical data analysis statistical software such as spss statistics version 21 and r packaging were used to process the data such as mean standard error removal efficiencies linear correlation and analysis of variance one way anova were done to analyze efficiency of cwt treating floriculture industry wastewater 3 result and discussion 3 1 influent and effluent organic matter removal efficiency influent and effluent concentration of the seven floriculture industries for physicochemical organic and heavy metal was assessed table 1 as shown in the table 1 the ph of the influent of seven floriculture industrial wastewaters was within the range of 5 47 0 21 6 9 0 16 while the ph of the effluent ranged between 5 71 0 49 6 73 0 9 significant differences were found in the influent and effluent of ph values between different sites of cws p 0 05 the pairwise one way anova result showed that there was a significant difference in the influent and effluent of ph between j vs et m vs j and sh vs j of constructed wetlands locations p 0 05 3 1 1 total suspended solids tss remova in this study the tss analysis revealed that influent and effluent mean value of the m z et sh ko aws and du cws was ranged from165 3 2 36 247 0 7 mg l the lowest tss of the influent was recorded 165 2 9 mg l in m cw site while the highest value was 247 0 02 mg l which is obtained from the sh cw site the tss in the effluent was in the range of 17 6 9 mg l 31 6 7 09 mg l and the lowest mean tss was observed in the effluent of the j cws system while the highest value recorded in the effluent of the sh and ko cws system may be due to its greet influent concentration during study period total suspended solids decreased significantly from the inlet to the outlet the result showed the maximum tss removal efficiency was observed at the j cw treatment site with 90 35 followed by dug 89 0 cw site the lower removal efficiency was observed in ko cws sites 86 70 statistical analysis showed that tss removal in cw was significant p 0 05 so the higher in the tss removal efficiency percentage in some of the studied cws might be due to difference in cw aspect ratio length width through which the wastewater flows and tss are mainly removed by physical process such as sedimentation and filtration due to increase in the hrt retention similar result was also reported by tadesse etal 24 were the settling rate of particles depends on a number of factors such as the wetland length that affects the efficiency in removing sss when we compared cws system for floriculture wastewater treatment performance efficiency in different country studied this study for the removal of tss was in agreement with the study conducted in kenya by rosemary et al 66 and thailand by brix et al 65 however other reports from kenya by mosh 17 studies showed higher removal efficiency for tss the average percent reductions of tss in the present study showed higher performance than some other countries for other types of wastewater studied in cameroon 18 and greece 19 but similar to the mean percent reduction reported from kenya 20 and uk 21 though the removal efficiency attained in this study was lower than the results obtained from tunisia 22 and italy 23 similarly genet 2007 studied result of domestic wastewater showed that tss removal efficiency of cw was also high 85 and higher removal efficiency of tss might be due to the fact that in ssf constructed wetlands the water flows below the ground through gravel and wetland plant roots this facilitates the physical chemical and biological wastewater treatment mechanisms such as sedimentation aggregation surface adhesion and biodegradation 24 these processes improve the efficiency of removing tss in the ssfcw within a short hydraulic retention time 2 5 days 25 3 1 2 total dissolved solids tds removal as it is indicated in table 1 and fig 2 tds in ssfcw systems at different rounds was within the range of 237 67 2 05 mg l 391 67 6 18 mg l during the follow up period the highest tds 180 66 3 86 mg l was recorded within the effluent of the et cw while the lowest value was 112 8 16 mg l in the effluent of the dug cws system likewise the cw had better removal efficiency for tds removal which was higher at ko cws 64 6 the lower removal efficiency was recorded in sh cw sites 46 23 statistically proved significant at p 0 05 similar studies in tannery wastewater by ketema 26 showed an average tds removal efficiency of 44 the principal constituents that contribute to high tds values are usually dissolved salts such as calcium magnesium sodium potassium chloride sulphate and nitrate used in various processes the high levels detected in the sampling sites could mostly emanate from agrochemical based fertilizers high concentrations of tds limit the suitability of water as drinking sources and irrigation supply 67 total suspended solids in ssf cw are mainly removed through sedimentation filtration aggregation and surface adhesion 27 3 1 3 total phosphorus tp removal during the assessment period the average tp concentrations of the influent which fed the constructed wetland systems ranged from 0 53 mg l 6 77 0 92 mg l the highest concentration of tp in the influent was obtained from ko cw site while the lowest concentration was recorded in sh cw sites table 1 the average tp concentrations in the effluents of the m z et ko aws and du cw systems were 0 57 05 0 3 0 05 0 27 0 05 0 21 0 1 2 06 0 38 2 13 0 48 and 2 03 0 24 mg l respectively table 1 the lowest concentration of tp was obtained in the effluent of the sh cw system location while the highest concentration value was recorded in the effluent aws and cw system sites the removal efficiency of tp by the m z et sh ko aws and dug systems at different rounds of the study period was in the range of 49 12 93 55 fig 2 the lowest tp removal efficiency was 49 12 obtained in sh cw systems the highest tp percent removal was recorded in the et cws system significance difference in the removal efficiency of tp at p 0 05 was observed p is usually removed via adsorption onto the substrate there is also microbial and plant uptake the difference in removal efficiency between different cws sits may be due to variation in hrt wetland vegetation substrates used cw volume and aspect ratio the vegetation type may also affect tp removal due to different nutrient uptake capability and o2 supply to root zone which might create more anaerobic condition for p release and aerobic conditions for p uptake the cws system in this study showed higher performance efficiency of tp compared with floriculture wastewater in studied kenya by mosh 17 65 and rosemary et al 66 and thailand by brix et al 65 this study was in agreement with similar reported from china by guo et al 28 and lu et al 29 colombia by caselles osorio et al 30 india by deeptha et al 31 and usa by menon and holland 64 however in this study the removal percentage was higher than the values reported in china 32 kenya 33 and turkey 34 vymazal 35 also showed that the removal of tp varied between 40 and 60 in all types of cws depending on the type of cws and inflow loading and wetland substrate siti et al 36 described that the use of specialized media in cws to improve p removal should be developed and demonstrated since p removal always shows the worse performance in the wetlands the relatively low removal efficiency in this study could be related to the application of gravel as filling media since gravel could not be considered as a good p adsorption wetland media as reported by vymazal 37 filtration adsorption and plant uptake and biological assimilation could be the main removal mechanisms of p in this study 3 1 4 chemical oxygen demand cod removal the influent cod concentrations of the wastewater discharged into the m z et sh ko aws and du cws at different sites ranged between 325 33 5 56 688 67 11 09 mg l table 1 the highest average cod influent concentration 688 67 11 09 was obtained at du cw sites while the lowest value 325 3 6 8 mg l was recorded in m site cw similarly the cod concentrations of the effluents were 118 6 2 238 3 13 91 mg l table 1 the lowest cod mean 118 6 2 mg l of the effluent of the sh site concentrated wetland system was recorded accordingly the effluent concentration of the m z et and sh systems for cod showed significantly difference between each cw at p 0 05 result showed that the removal efficiency of cod for m j et sh ko aws and du were 53 49 74 33 43 13 76 01 66 7 65 5 and 65 4 respectively the lowest performance was shown by the et cw system while the sh cws system showed the highest performance fig 3 the one way anova result also indicated statistically significant differences in the removal efficiencies of the cw systems in removing cod p 0 05 the performance of ssfcw for cod removal was low during the study period this was related generally due to biomass growth within the wetland scheme the cws system in this study for the removal of cod showed higher performance compared to the study conducted in kenya by mosh 17 and rosemary et al 66 and thailand by brix et al 65 for floriculture wastewater comparing with other types of wastes treated in cws the present study has also higher cod removal than the result reported by abdelhakeem et al 38 in egypt which was 75 al isawi et al 21 in uk which is 58 39 in pakistan 44 and yang et al 40 in china 49 likewise the cod removal percentage was in agreement with the result reported in by vergeles et al 41 in ukraine 77 however relatively better percent reductions were reported in kenya 96 by khisa and mwakio 42 tunisia 95 by ghrabi et al 22 and india by deeptha et al 31 this study confirmed that a high cod removal efficiency obtained in studied sites could be due to higher plant growth rate in addition a key part of the degradation of cod in the wastewater might be qualified to microorganisms evolving a symbiotic association with the plants the advanced efficiency of the cw could also be attributed to the huge rooting system as long as a larger surface area for microbial attachment which accordingly decomposes the organic matter 43 the nature of the plants also suggests that they can diffuse oxygen to the root zone diemont 12 reported that the removal of cod in cws primarily depends on the amount of oxygen in wastewater tanner et al 44 also reported cod removal of 95 and 62 efficiency using aerated and non aerated wetland treatment systems respectively for the treatment of textile wastewater organic matter is aerobically and anaerobically decomposed by the microorganisms attached to the plant roots and the media surface 45 3 1 5 sulphate so4 2 and sulphide s2 removal the average influent so4 2 concentration was 84 66 63 mg l while effluent was 19 11 3 30 the result showed that the removal efficiency of the m z et sh ko aws and du cws systems in removing so4 during the assessment period was 31 69 60 3 49 53 46 92 56 01 57 40 and 61 01 respectively fig 3 although the z and the du cw systems showed slightly better performance all the studied cws systems show significant difference in removing so4 2 p 0 05 the removal efficiencies of the m z et sh ko aws and du cws in removing sulphide were ranged from 20 33 to 86 53 the performance of the m z et sh ko aws and du cws systems in removing sulphide significantly different from one another significantly p 0 05 the present study was in agreement with studies conducted for the treatment of tannery wastewater by semanda 46 el bestawy 47 and govindasamy et al 48 the cws in the present study have showed lower removal efficiency of sulfide when compared with other types of wastewater a study conducted by ketema 26 using subsurface flow cws showed lower removal of sulfide ranges from 20 to 50 another study conducted by genet 49 also showed higher sulfide removal 98 7 to 99 for domestic wastewater using subsurface flow cws the possible reason for the lower removal efficiency of sulfate and sulphide in the present study may be due to high sulfur compounds in the influent low heavy metal concentration and short operation time of the cws which provides short period for the accumulation of metals essential for sulfide reduction 3 1 6 ammonium nh4 n removal and nitrate no3 n the result revealed that the average nh4 n concentration in the influent varied between 7 7 23 2 1 63 mg l the highest average value of nh4 n 23 2 1 63 mg l of the influent was obtained in du cw sites whereas the influent had the lowest average concentration of nh4 n was7 7 1 15 in the m cw location table 1 similarly the average concentration of nh4 n within the effluents of the m z et sh ko aws and du was 3 3 0 4 3 2 0 63 3 3 0 47 3 3 1 52 19 43 2 36 22 2 94 and 23 2 1 63 mg l respectively table 1 the lowest mean nh4 n of 3 2 mg l was obtained in the effluent of the z cw sites while the higher nh4 value of 11 21 1 31 was recorded in the effluent of the du cw sites the removal efficiency of the cws for nh4 n floriculture industries ranged from 46 2 to 71 41 fig 3 the result showed that highest performance variability among the seven cws higher and lower nh4 n removal efficiency was recorded in du and ko cw systems i e 71 41 cw and 46 2 respectively the performance of the cws systems in removing nh4 was significantly different from one another p 0 05 nh4 removal efficiency of subsurface flow cws applied in kenya 17 90 for floriculture wastewater showed higher removal efficiency than the present study 65 however comparison with other types of wastes the average removal percentage of nh4 n obtained in some of the cws in this study was higher than the nh4 n percent reduction reported in pakistan 49 39 egypt 45 50 and china 38 7 28 the nh4 n percent reduction in this study was similar to the results reported in turkey 51 ireland 52 and colombia 30 however relatively better nh4 removal efficiency of the subsurface flow constructed wetlands was reported in singapore 80 53 and uk 91 21 tuncsiper et al 54 pointed out that ssf wetland system shows lower nh4 removal this might be due to the reason that horizontal flow system gives suitable environmental conditions for denitrification though the condition for nitrification is limited the lower removal efficiency in general is attributed to low hydraulic retention time which affects the nitrification process the cw system on the removal efficiency of no3 n shows that the influent nitrate concentrations that feeds the m z et sh ko aws and du cws systems were in the range of 10 7 73 67 4 99 mg l the average no3 n concentrations in the effluents were 7 5 19 mg l for m cw 6 3 4 9 mg l for j cw 12 7 1 53 mg l for the et cw 8 7 1 57 mg l for the sh 27 7 12 for cw ko 27 7 12 aws 27 66 2 86 and 24 33 2 50 for dug cws sites similarly the performance of the cws technology for the treatment of seven floriculture wastewater to treat nitrate the result showed that the lowest removal efficiency 17 85 was obtained in sh cws while the highest removal efficiency 66 0 was recorded in the du cws similarly the seven different systems in nitrate removal have significant differences at p 0 05 the results in this study was in agreement with no3 removal efficiency reported in pakistan by sehar et al 55 70 3 80 4 and india 63 1 71 1 56 in spite of this negative removal efficiency of no3 in the effluents was reported in ireland 52 and uk 21 the biological processes of nitrate removal in ssfcw are by denitrification which is the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas by heterotrophic bacteria using nitrate as an electron acceptor and organic matter as carbon sources under anoxic conditions in most part of cws nitrification is the biological oxidation of ammonia to nitrite nitrate by two specialized groups of autotrophic bacteria under aerobic conditions 1 use of nitrification and denitrification in treating wastewater with high levels of ammonium requires high energy input in order to supply oxygen during nitrification and high alkalinity levels decreasing the ph and affecting system stability the lower nitrate removal in most of the cws was due to lack of sufficient anaerobic system in the cws that lowers the rate of denitrification this is due to lack of sufficient anoxic system for nitrate removal through denitrification moreover cws remove nitrate from cw through plant uptake is lower 2 nitrate can also be removed via storage assimilation or sediment adsorption and accretion in the system 63 3 1 7 total nitrogen tn removal results on the average tn values in the influent of the m and z cw systems were in the range of 28 3 12 7 mg l and 60 6 8 ml l respectively similarly the average effluent concentrations of tn in the effluent during the monitoring period were 11 7 63 mg l for the m 11 3 6 69 mg l for the z 19 7 1 15 mg l for the et cw 17 3 3 5 mg l for sh cws 40 33 6 59 for ko cws 37 0 4 96 for aws and 38 33 4 1 for du cws systems the lowest tn concentration 11 27 6 69 mg l was recorded j cw effluent the average tn removal efficiency of the m z et sh ko aws and du cws systems based on the concentration value were evaluated and the result was 66 21 69 69 54 29 71 44 58 0 58 2 and 59 40 respectively the lowest performance was shown by the et cw system while the j cw system showed the highest performance fig 4 the result of one way anova also indicated that the removal efficiency difference between systems was significant at p 0 05 the maximum tn removal efficiency of m z et sh ko aws and du cw were 69 90 67 71 and 83 for total nitrogen tn and 45 76 53 47 84 81 and 68 for ammonium nitrogen nh4 n respectively fig 4 these results suggest that the operating units in the cws treatment plant are efficient systems in removing total nitrogen from floriculture wastewater plants and microorganisms consume nitrogen in the form of ammonium ions from organic matter 24 suspended denitrifying bacteria reduced nitrite and nitrate to nitrogen gas using floriculture wastewater as carbon sources nitrification is therefore occurred in the system in constructed wetland columns further the presence of low oxygen concentration in cws limits nitrification and low ph 7 2 in cws effluent limit ammonification processes which results in low total nitrogen removal efficiency of the system the mean percent reductions of tn for floriculture wastewater removal efficiency obtained in this study 71 4 was lower than the result reported in kenya 88 6 17 when we compared different types of wastewater in other countries tn removal in the present study was higher than the removal efficiencies reported in kenya 33 usa 57 china 29 but this study has lower removal efficiencies than studies reported in india 31 the performance of the ssf constructed wetland systems applied in this study was relatively similar with the value of reported in in south korea 58 and tunisia 22 the characteristic of the floriculture wastewater revealed that influent and effluent variability was observed within cw sites during the study period the difference in organic matter and nutrient removal of pollutants in the cws sites may be due to the difference in inter and intra specific variabilities of microorganisms climate conditions and other factors such as hrt cw substrates and plant type the final effluent concentration of organic and inorganic parameters namely tss so4 2 and tp were below ethiopia epa eepa discharge limit values for all studied cws while s2 tds and nh4 n were above eepa discharge limit values for cod except sh cws site all the remaining six cws sites effluent discharge concentration were above eepa discharge limit values in addition the final effluent concentration of no3 n for m j and sh cws sites were below the standard limit value while for et ko aws and dug were above the effluent discharge standard limit value 3 2 heavy metals removal the result showed that the concentration of heavy metals copper cu manganese mn and lead pb discharged from cw were very low the mean influent concentration of lead in the flower farm wastewater was low and ranges from 0 05 0 001 0 63 0 09 effluents ranging from undetectable levels 0 05 0 001 to a high of 0 63 0 09 mg l like lead copper mean influent concentrations were also low rarely exceeding 0 083 0 004 mg l the mean influent concentrations ranged from undetectable levels to a high of 0 57 0 11 mg l likewise the effluent mean concentration range from 0 03 0 004 mg l 1 up to 0 42 0 050 mg l influent mean concentrations for manganese were ranged from 0 47 0 01 mg l to 0 70 0 07 mg l and the mean effluent concentration similarly ranges from 0 06 0 013 to 0 43 0 153 the cw had better removal efficiency for mn which was higher at sh cws 89 65 the lower removal efficiency was recorded in aws cw sites 39 0 the influent and effluent mean concentrations of pb cu and mg were varying significantly between different sites of cws at p 0 05 for all studied heavy metals no significant difference was observed within sampling rounds the mean effluent and influent values of heavy metals was very low 0 4 mg l because heavy metals are consumed in less amount in floriculture industries fig 5 the spatial concentration of heavy metals at the seven cw sites m j et ko aws and du and the level of each heavy metal in the wastewater at each round of sampling were compared fig 5 the removal efficiency of cu by the m z et sh ko aws and dug systems at different sites of the cws systems was in the range of 34 27 64 0 the lowest pb removal efficiency was obtained in 16 32 in et cw systems the highest pb percent removal was recorded in the m cws system 59 51 at p 0 05 the final effluent of cu for all seven cw sites and pb in m j et and sh cws sites were below eepa ethiopian discharge limit values similarly the final outlet discharge effluents for mn concentration m j et sh and ko were below eepa discharge limit values while aws and dug cws sites were above eepa discharge limit values in addition results showed that the removal rates of wastewater pollutants were increased as the hrt increased although the association varied from parameter to parameter in this study among the seven subsurface flow cw cells the dug systems showed relatively higher removal efficiencies than others for most wastewaters the effluents were expected to be highly polluted with pesticides and fertilizer used in the floriculture farm the low qualities of heavy metals indicate that floriculture industry is not a major threat to the water bodies and ecosystems in fact the low amounts available also have an effect on health and the surrounding due to bioaccumulation 4 conclusion the request of operative low cost less energy rigorous and simply operated secondary wastewater treatment methods is an issue of great concern in developing countries the vital outcomes of this study provides a snapshot of the performance of the floriculture cw system in ethiopia based on the results of this study floriculture cws wastewater treatment showed high levels of nh4 n no3 n and tn tp cod and tss in the effluents heavy metals usually present in little concentrations effectively removed from the system meeting national discharge standards the marked variations of effluent concentration were observed within the cw was due to difference in daily activities which includes spraying propagation and cleaning of the houses and containers used in fertilizer and other chemical preparations the assessed flower farm cws were significantly reduced nutrients and organic load in most cws the highest removal efficiency was observed in tss 86 90 tp 67 93 cod 53 76 mn 51 89 and moderately removal was observed in nh4 n 61 72 no3 n 56 73 tn 58 71 lower removal efficiency for so4 2 31 61 s2 20 61 and tds 46 57 was observed in most cws the treatment s performance of the floriculture cws systems assessed was very encouraging therefore more research is suggested to define the levels of sediments and biota around floriculture industry wastewater on a wider perspective and development is necessary for making the cw technology as a promising decentralized technology for

13779,in the present study subsurface flow constructed wetlands treatments ssfcwt for the treatment of floriculture industry wastewater in ethiopia was studied the objective of the study was to assess the efficiency of ssfcwt in treating floriculture industry wastewater seven ssfcw was assessed for physiochemical and heavy metal removal efficiency using standard methods apha and compared to its treatment efficiency the results showed that treated water quality significantly improved from the inlet to the outlet with tss tds and tp reduced from 247 0 02 to 31 66 5 8 391 67 6 18 to 80 66 3 86 6 7 0 92 to 2 06 0 38 respectively similarly nh 4 n no 3 n and tn reduced from 22 2 94 to 9 8 1 96 73 67 4 99 to 27 0 7 12 and 94 4 08 to 38 33 4 11 respectively the result showed that highest performance variability was observed among the studied ssfcws the heavy metal concentration in the influent to effluent for pb cu and mn was reduced from 0 63 0 09 to 0 36 0 11 0 49 0 08 to 0 18 0 05 and 0 70 0 07 to 0 43 0 15 respectively this assessment has proved that a significant reduction of pollutants was observed using ssfcw treatments there is a need to encourage other floriculture industry to adopt and implement constructed wetland technology as a primary option to protect the environment and public health keywords constructed wetland nutrient removal heavy metal removal efficiency floriculture wastewater 1 introduction rapid agro industrialization and expansion of economic activities in developing countries are frequently associated with significant wastewater ww generation which requires effective and efficient treatment system before discharging in to the environment pollution of subsurface water spoils water ecosystem courses and pose ecological and public health risks in developing countries like ethiopia 1 2 this is due to population and economic growth which contributing to release of raw or moderately treated ww into the environment 2 in ethiopia agro industries are speedily rising with increased generation of wastewater to the water environment 2 among the agro industries floriculture is growing in developing countries such as ethiopia kenya tanzania and uganda 3 the floriculture by its nature requires high fertilizer and pesticide application which poses a potential treat in to the environment and human health 4 in 1997 ethiopian floriculture starts with just two flower farms but has grown to more than 80 flower farms in 2012 5 currently 84 floriculture industries are functioning in ethiopia and are the second largest flower producer and exporter in africa next to kenya 3 however it was increasingly coming under criticism for some of its social and environmental shortcomings due to wastewater discharge and its associated consequences because of poor management of waste and wastewater the sector produces about usd 200 million export with more than 85 000 jobs created 6 due to the government active facilitation and incentive scheme programme s in spite of the economic success floriculture industries have been blamed for excessive water use pollution and impacts on aquatic biodiversity 7 8 6 61 the wastewater discharge sources are pack houses where the plans are graded and packed for export the bio control agent houses laundry staff canteen overflow from irrigation farm and washing water the wastewater is frequently discharged into the aquatic environment rivers and lakes partially treated or untreated fostering eutrophication and dissolved oxygen depletion leading to the death of aquatic organisms 9 10 the ever increasing of contaminants from floriculture industry in ethiopia initiate the development of adoptive and cost effective technologies progressive wastewater treatment technologies are vital for the treatment of industrial wastewater to keep public health and to encounter water quality criteria for reuse the aquatic setting and for water reprocessing 11 cwt is mainly used as polishing treatment method for agro industrial wastewater treatment due to its simplicity and low cost 59 60 cwt is becoming more prevalent for post treatment of wastewater 24 cwt has a relatively low operating and maintenance costs it does not also rely on machinery or energy input 44 cwt has been applied and promoted for wastewater purification in many parts of the world and are highly suited to tropics due to favourable climate conditions 12 due to simplicity of technology the floriculture industries in ethiopia implemented cwt for its wastewater treatment constructed wasteland treatment efficiency is a function of environmental conditions and proper management 13 in order to establish the efficiency of cw systems various studies have been carried out on the removal of pathogens organic matter and nutrients in different wastewaters 10 14 62 most of the research done on cw efficiency have been carried out under temperature climate 15 to date limited research studies on the efficiencies of cw systems particularly under tropical conditions in africa have been reported 7 but its adoption and application of it has been growing since two decades 4 the need for long term monitoring to track efficiency trends especially in cws treating flower farm wastewater is of urgent need since information is currently lacking in ethiopia floriculture industry generate wastewater ww coming from different compartments but very often there is an assumption that such generated ww is rich in nutrients due to fertilizer application currently in ethiopia a comprehensive study has not been assessed on the efficiency of the cw system treating floriculture ww before discharging into the aquatic environment however a comprehensive study has not been conducted to assess on the efficiency of the cwt system in treating floriculture industry therefore the objective of this study was aimed at assessing the efficiency of ssfcwt in treating floriculture industry wastewater for heavy metal and physico chemical removal capability at seven floriculture industries 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description this study was conducted in ethiopia oromia regional state where the majority of flower farm industries is found oromia regional state is located at latitude 7 59 20 62 n longitude 39 22 52 25 e 7 59 20 6 n 39 22 52 3 e 7 989062 39 381180 the climate of the study area is varied across region due to varies topography the average annual temperature in the study area is ranges from 6 c to 36 c and rain fall ranges from 892 mm 33 inch to 1162 45 7 inch it is categorized with a moist tropical climate and extreme precipitation from june to august the remarkable features of the study area tropical climate are higher temperature year round plant growth and microbial activity which enhance higher nutrient removal in the cws there are rigorous agricultural undertakings with cattle grazing and setting up of floriculture industries in the nearby the effluent of the floriculture industries directly discharges to the river the studied floriculture industries are found within 60 km radius of the capital addis ababa except koka and ziway which are located 200 and 260 kms away from addis ababa respectively fig 1 2 2 constructed wetland design characteristics all the seven cw treating floriculture wastewater assessed in this study was using subsurface flow cws the average depth of the growth media was 0 25 0 6 m and the effluent level was 5 cm below the surface of the media for all ssfcw the volume varies depending on the size of the floriculture industry before actual sampling the hydraulic retention time was recorded m j and ko have 3 days hrt and et sh and dug have 5 days hrt the subsurface cws influent volume for m j ko aws et sh and dug was 11 38m3 day 13 18 m3 day 10 58 m3 day 10 28 m3 day 17 83 m3 day 14 39 m3 day 12 78 m3 day respectively the substrate used by all the seven cws was gravel and hard core at the inlet and outlet the cw plants used in all sampling cws were canna lilies typha latifolia and cypreus papyrus influent and effluent floriculture waste water were collected and analysed for heavy metal and physicochemical parameters 2 3 sample collection and wastewater quality analysis sample wastewater was taken from seven cws of the floriculture industries a sample of two litters of wastewater before and after constructed wetland treatment influent and effluent was taken using rinsed and washed plastic bottles from all sampled floriculture industries a three round sample was taken every 15 days from october 2019 to january 2020 comprehensive wastewater characterization was examined using american public health association 16 standards selected parameters such as total suspended solids tss total dissolved solids tds chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrite nitrogen no3 n sulfides s2 and sulfate so4 2 ph and tds were analysed using electrometric method using portable ph ec tds meter cod tss no3 n no2 n nh4 n tn and tp were analaysed using spectro meter dr3900 hack method in additon sulfate so4 2 sulfide s2 were analysed using spectrophotometer dr 2010 usa hach method heavy metals cu mn and pb analysis was performed using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas model analytical jena nova aa 400p germany following standard methods 16 the selected parameters performance efficiencies of the treatment system were calculated using the formula 1 r c i c f c i 100 where r removal efficiency in percent ci is the influent concentration mg l and cf is the effluent concentration mg l 2 4 statistical data analysis statistical software such as spss statistics version 21 and r packaging were used to process the data such as mean standard error removal efficiencies linear correlation and analysis of variance one way anova were done to analyze efficiency of cwt treating floriculture industry wastewater 3 result and discussion 3 1 influent and effluent organic matter removal efficiency influent and effluent concentration of the seven floriculture industries for physicochemical organic and heavy metal was assessed table 1 as shown in the table 1 the ph of the influent of seven floriculture industrial wastewaters was within the range of 5 47 0 21 6 9 0 16 while the ph of the effluent ranged between 5 71 0 49 6 73 0 9 significant differences were found in the influent and effluent of ph values between different sites of cws p 0 05 the pairwise one way anova result showed that there was a significant difference in the influent and effluent of ph between j vs et m vs j and sh vs j of constructed wetlands locations p 0 05 3 1 1 total suspended solids tss remova in this study the tss analysis revealed that influent and effluent mean value of the m z et sh ko aws and du cws was ranged from165 3 2 36 247 0 7 mg l the lowest tss of the influent was recorded 165 2 9 mg l in m cw site while the highest value was 247 0 02 mg l which is obtained from the sh cw site the tss in the effluent was in the range of 17 6 9 mg l 31 6 7 09 mg l and the lowest mean tss was observed in the effluent of the j cws system while the highest value recorded in the effluent of the sh and ko cws system may be due to its greet influent concentration during study period total suspended solids decreased significantly from the inlet to the outlet the result showed the maximum tss removal efficiency was observed at the j cw treatment site with 90 35 followed by dug 89 0 cw site the lower removal efficiency was observed in ko cws sites 86 70 statistical analysis showed that tss removal in cw was significant p 0 05 so the higher in the tss removal efficiency percentage in some of the studied cws might be due to difference in cw aspect ratio length width through which the wastewater flows and tss are mainly removed by physical process such as sedimentation and filtration due to increase in the hrt retention similar result was also reported by tadesse etal 24 were the settling rate of particles depends on a number of factors such as the wetland length that affects the efficiency in removing sss when we compared cws system for floriculture wastewater treatment performance efficiency in different country studied this study for the removal of tss was in agreement with the study conducted in kenya by rosemary et al 66 and thailand by brix et al 65 however other reports from kenya by mosh 17 studies showed higher removal efficiency for tss the average percent reductions of tss in the present study showed higher performance than some other countries for other types of wastewater studied in cameroon 18 and greece 19 but similar to the mean percent reduction reported from kenya 20 and uk 21 though the removal efficiency attained in this study was lower than the results obtained from tunisia 22 and italy 23 similarly genet 2007 studied result of domestic wastewater showed that tss removal efficiency of cw was also high 85 and higher removal efficiency of tss might be due to the fact that in ssf constructed wetlands the water flows below the ground through gravel and wetland plant roots this facilitates the physical chemical and biological wastewater treatment mechanisms such as sedimentation aggregation surface adhesion and biodegradation 24 these processes improve the efficiency of removing tss in the ssfcw within a short hydraulic retention time 2 5 days 25 3 1 2 total dissolved solids tds removal as it is indicated in table 1 and fig 2 tds in ssfcw systems at different rounds was within the range of 237 67 2 05 mg l 391 67 6 18 mg l during the follow up period the highest tds 180 66 3 86 mg l was recorded within the effluent of the et cw while the lowest value was 112 8 16 mg l in the effluent of the dug cws system likewise the cw had better removal efficiency for tds removal which was higher at ko cws 64 6 the lower removal efficiency was recorded in sh cw sites 46 23 statistically proved significant at p 0 05 similar studies in tannery wastewater by ketema 26 showed an average tds removal efficiency of 44 the principal constituents that contribute to high tds values are usually dissolved salts such as calcium magnesium sodium potassium chloride sulphate and nitrate used in various processes the high levels detected in the sampling sites could mostly emanate from agrochemical based fertilizers high concentrations of tds limit the suitability of water as drinking sources and irrigation supply 67 total suspended solids in ssf cw are mainly removed through sedimentation filtration aggregation and surface adhesion 27 3 1 3 total phosphorus tp removal during the assessment period the average tp concentrations of the influent which fed the constructed wetland systems ranged from 0 53 mg l 6 77 0 92 mg l the highest concentration of tp in the influent was obtained from ko cw site while the lowest concentration was recorded in sh cw sites table 1 the average tp concentrations in the effluents of the m z et ko aws and du cw systems were 0 57 05 0 3 0 05 0 27 0 05 0 21 0 1 2 06 0 38 2 13 0 48 and 2 03 0 24 mg l respectively table 1 the lowest concentration of tp was obtained in the effluent of the sh cw system location while the highest concentration value was recorded in the effluent aws and cw system sites the removal efficiency of tp by the m z et sh ko aws and dug systems at different rounds of the study period was in the range of 49 12 93 55 fig 2 the lowest tp removal efficiency was 49 12 obtained in sh cw systems the highest tp percent removal was recorded in the et cws system significance difference in the removal efficiency of tp at p 0 05 was observed p is usually removed via adsorption onto the substrate there is also microbial and plant uptake the difference in removal efficiency between different cws sits may be due to variation in hrt wetland vegetation substrates used cw volume and aspect ratio the vegetation type may also affect tp removal due to different nutrient uptake capability and o2 supply to root zone which might create more anaerobic condition for p release and aerobic conditions for p uptake the cws system in this study showed higher performance efficiency of tp compared with floriculture wastewater in studied kenya by mosh 17 65 and rosemary et al 66 and thailand by brix et al 65 this study was in agreement with similar reported from china by guo et al 28 and lu et al 29 colombia by caselles osorio et al 30 india by deeptha et al 31 and usa by menon and holland 64 however in this study the removal percentage was higher than the values reported in china 32 kenya 33 and turkey 34 vymazal 35 also showed that the removal of tp varied between 40 and 60 in all types of cws depending on the type of cws and inflow loading and wetland substrate siti et al 36 described that the use of specialized media in cws to improve p removal should be developed and demonstrated since p removal always shows the worse performance in the wetlands the relatively low removal efficiency in this study could be related to the application of gravel as filling media since gravel could not be considered as a good p adsorption wetland media as reported by vymazal 37 filtration adsorption and plant uptake and biological assimilation could be the main removal mechanisms of p in this study 3 1 4 chemical oxygen demand cod removal the influent cod concentrations of the wastewater discharged into the m z et sh ko aws and du cws at different sites ranged between 325 33 5 56 688 67 11 09 mg l table 1 the highest average cod influent concentration 688 67 11 09 was obtained at du cw sites while the lowest value 325 3 6 8 mg l was recorded in m site cw similarly the cod concentrations of the effluents were 118 6 2 238 3 13 91 mg l table 1 the lowest cod mean 118 6 2 mg l of the effluent of the sh site concentrated wetland system was recorded accordingly the effluent concentration of the m z et and sh systems for cod showed significantly difference between each cw at p 0 05 result showed that the removal efficiency of cod for m j et sh ko aws and du were 53 49 74 33 43 13 76 01 66 7 65 5 and 65 4 respectively the lowest performance was shown by the et cw system while the sh cws system showed the highest performance fig 3 the one way anova result also indicated statistically significant differences in the removal efficiencies of the cw systems in removing cod p 0 05 the performance of ssfcw for cod removal was low during the study period this was related generally due to biomass growth within the wetland scheme the cws system in this study for the removal of cod showed higher performance compared to the study conducted in kenya by mosh 17 and rosemary et al 66 and thailand by brix et al 65 for floriculture wastewater comparing with other types of wastes treated in cws the present study has also higher cod removal than the result reported by abdelhakeem et al 38 in egypt which was 75 al isawi et al 21 in uk which is 58 39 in pakistan 44 and yang et al 40 in china 49 likewise the cod removal percentage was in agreement with the result reported in by vergeles et al 41 in ukraine 77 however relatively better percent reductions were reported in kenya 96 by khisa and mwakio 42 tunisia 95 by ghrabi et al 22 and india by deeptha et al 31 this study confirmed that a high cod removal efficiency obtained in studied sites could be due to higher plant growth rate in addition a key part of the degradation of cod in the wastewater might be qualified to microorganisms evolving a symbiotic association with the plants the advanced efficiency of the cw could also be attributed to the huge rooting system as long as a larger surface area for microbial attachment which accordingly decomposes the organic matter 43 the nature of the plants also suggests that they can diffuse oxygen to the root zone diemont 12 reported that the removal of cod in cws primarily depends on the amount of oxygen in wastewater tanner et al 44 also reported cod removal of 95 and 62 efficiency using aerated and non aerated wetland treatment systems respectively for the treatment of textile wastewater organic matter is aerobically and anaerobically decomposed by the microorganisms attached to the plant roots and the media surface 45 3 1 5 sulphate so4 2 and sulphide s2 removal the average influent so4 2 concentration was 84 66 63 mg l while effluent was 19 11 3 30 the result showed that the removal efficiency of the m z et sh ko aws and du cws systems in removing so4 during the assessment period was 31 69 60 3 49 53 46 92 56 01 57 40 and 61 01 respectively fig 3 although the z and the du cw systems showed slightly better performance all the studied cws systems show significant difference in removing so4 2 p 0 05 the removal efficiencies of the m z et sh ko aws and du cws in removing sulphide were ranged from 20 33 to 86 53 the performance of the m z et sh ko aws and du cws systems in removing sulphide significantly different from one another significantly p 0 05 the present study was in agreement with studies conducted for the treatment of tannery wastewater by semanda 46 el bestawy 47 and govindasamy et al 48 the cws in the present study have showed lower removal efficiency of sulfide when compared with other types of wastewater a study conducted by ketema 26 using subsurface flow cws showed lower removal of sulfide ranges from 20 to 50 another study conducted by genet 49 also showed higher sulfide removal 98 7 to 99 for domestic wastewater using subsurface flow cws the possible reason for the lower removal efficiency of sulfate and sulphide in the present study may be due to high sulfur compounds in the influent low heavy metal concentration and short operation time of the cws which provides short period for the accumulation of metals essential for sulfide reduction 3 1 6 ammonium nh4 n removal and nitrate no3 n the result revealed that the average nh4 n concentration in the influent varied between 7 7 23 2 1 63 mg l the highest average value of nh4 n 23 2 1 63 mg l of the influent was obtained in du cw sites whereas the influent had the lowest average concentration of nh4 n was7 7 1 15 in the m cw location table 1 similarly the average concentration of nh4 n within the effluents of the m z et sh ko aws and du was 3 3 0 4 3 2 0 63 3 3 0 47 3 3 1 52 19 43 2 36 22 2 94 and 23 2 1 63 mg l respectively table 1 the lowest mean nh4 n of 3 2 mg l was obtained in the effluent of the z cw sites while the higher nh4 value of 11 21 1 31 was recorded in the effluent of the du cw sites the removal efficiency of the cws for nh4 n floriculture industries ranged from 46 2 to 71 41 fig 3 the result showed that highest performance variability among the seven cws higher and lower nh4 n removal efficiency was recorded in du and ko cw systems i e 71 41 cw and 46 2 respectively the performance of the cws systems in removing nh4 was significantly different from one another p 0 05 nh4 removal efficiency of subsurface flow cws applied in kenya 17 90 for floriculture wastewater showed higher removal efficiency than the present study 65 however comparison with other types of wastes the average removal percentage of nh4 n obtained in some of the cws in this study was higher than the nh4 n percent reduction reported in pakistan 49 39 egypt 45 50 and china 38 7 28 the nh4 n percent reduction in this study was similar to the results reported in turkey 51 ireland 52 and colombia 30 however relatively better nh4 removal efficiency of the subsurface flow constructed wetlands was reported in singapore 80 53 and uk 91 21 tuncsiper et al 54 pointed out that ssf wetland system shows lower nh4 removal this might be due to the reason that horizontal flow system gives suitable environmental conditions for denitrification though the condition for nitrification is limited the lower removal efficiency in general is attributed to low hydraulic retention time which affects the nitrification process the cw system on the removal efficiency of no3 n shows that the influent nitrate concentrations that feeds the m z et sh ko aws and du cws systems were in the range of 10 7 73 67 4 99 mg l the average no3 n concentrations in the effluents were 7 5 19 mg l for m cw 6 3 4 9 mg l for j cw 12 7 1 53 mg l for the et cw 8 7 1 57 mg l for the sh 27 7 12 for cw ko 27 7 12 aws 27 66 2 86 and 24 33 2 50 for dug cws sites similarly the performance of the cws technology for the treatment of seven floriculture wastewater to treat nitrate the result showed that the lowest removal efficiency 17 85 was obtained in sh cws while the highest removal efficiency 66 0 was recorded in the du cws similarly the seven different systems in nitrate removal have significant differences at p 0 05 the results in this study was in agreement with no3 removal efficiency reported in pakistan by sehar et al 55 70 3 80 4 and india 63 1 71 1 56 in spite of this negative removal efficiency of no3 in the effluents was reported in ireland 52 and uk 21 the biological processes of nitrate removal in ssfcw are by denitrification which is the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas by heterotrophic bacteria using nitrate as an electron acceptor and organic matter as carbon sources under anoxic conditions in most part of cws nitrification is the biological oxidation of ammonia to nitrite nitrate by two specialized groups of autotrophic bacteria under aerobic conditions 1 use of nitrification and denitrification in treating wastewater with high levels of ammonium requires high energy input in order to supply oxygen during nitrification and high alkalinity levels decreasing the ph and affecting system stability the lower nitrate removal in most of the cws was due to lack of sufficient anaerobic system in the cws that lowers the rate of denitrification this is due to lack of sufficient anoxic system for nitrate removal through denitrification moreover cws remove nitrate from cw through plant uptake is lower 2 nitrate can also be removed via storage assimilation or sediment adsorption and accretion in the system 63 3 1 7 total nitrogen tn removal results on the average tn values in the influent of the m and z cw systems were in the range of 28 3 12 7 mg l and 60 6 8 ml l respectively similarly the average effluent concentrations of tn in the effluent during the monitoring period were 11 7 63 mg l for the m 11 3 6 69 mg l for the z 19 7 1 15 mg l for the et cw 17 3 3 5 mg l for sh cws 40 33 6 59 for ko cws 37 0 4 96 for aws and 38 33 4 1 for du cws systems the lowest tn concentration 11 27 6 69 mg l was recorded j cw effluent the average tn removal efficiency of the m z et sh ko aws and du cws systems based on the concentration value were evaluated and the result was 66 21 69 69 54 29 71 44 58 0 58 2 and 59 40 respectively the lowest performance was shown by the et cw system while the j cw system showed the highest performance fig 4 the result of one way anova also indicated that the removal efficiency difference between systems was significant at p 0 05 the maximum tn removal efficiency of m z et sh ko aws and du cw were 69 90 67 71 and 83 for total nitrogen tn and 45 76 53 47 84 81 and 68 for ammonium nitrogen nh4 n respectively fig 4 these results suggest that the operating units in the cws treatment plant are efficient systems in removing total nitrogen from floriculture wastewater plants and microorganisms consume nitrogen in the form of ammonium ions from organic matter 24 suspended denitrifying bacteria reduced nitrite and nitrate to nitrogen gas using floriculture wastewater as carbon sources nitrification is therefore occurred in the system in constructed wetland columns further the presence of low oxygen concentration in cws limits nitrification and low ph 7 2 in cws effluent limit ammonification processes which results in low total nitrogen removal efficiency of the system the mean percent reductions of tn for floriculture wastewater removal efficiency obtained in this study 71 4 was lower than the result reported in kenya 88 6 17 when we compared different types of wastewater in other countries tn removal in the present study was higher than the removal efficiencies reported in kenya 33 usa 57 china 29 but this study has lower removal efficiencies than studies reported in india 31 the performance of the ssf constructed wetland systems applied in this study was relatively similar with the value of reported in in south korea 58 and tunisia 22 the characteristic of the floriculture wastewater revealed that influent and effluent variability was observed within cw sites during the study period the difference in organic matter and nutrient removal of pollutants in the cws sites may be due to the difference in inter and intra specific variabilities of microorganisms climate conditions and other factors such as hrt cw substrates and plant type the final effluent concentration of organic and inorganic parameters namely tss so4 2 and tp were below ethiopia epa eepa discharge limit values for all studied cws while s2 tds and nh4 n were above eepa discharge limit values for cod except sh cws site all the remaining six cws sites effluent discharge concentration were above eepa discharge limit values in addition the final effluent concentration of no3 n for m j and sh cws sites were below the standard limit value while for et ko aws and dug were above the effluent discharge standard limit value 3 2 heavy metals removal the result showed that the concentration of heavy metals copper cu manganese mn and lead pb discharged from cw were very low the mean influent concentration of lead in the flower farm wastewater was low and ranges from 0 05 0 001 0 63 0 09 effluents ranging from undetectable levels 0 05 0 001 to a high of 0 63 0 09 mg l like lead copper mean influent concentrations were also low rarely exceeding 0 083 0 004 mg l the mean influent concentrations ranged from undetectable levels to a high of 0 57 0 11 mg l likewise the effluent mean concentration range from 0 03 0 004 mg l 1 up to 0 42 0 050 mg l influent mean concentrations for manganese were ranged from 0 47 0 01 mg l to 0 70 0 07 mg l and the mean effluent concentration similarly ranges from 0 06 0 013 to 0 43 0 153 the cw had better removal efficiency for mn which was higher at sh cws 89 65 the lower removal efficiency was recorded in aws cw sites 39 0 the influent and effluent mean concentrations of pb cu and mg were varying significantly between different sites of cws at p 0 05 for all studied heavy metals no significant difference was observed within sampling rounds the mean effluent and influent values of heavy metals was very low 0 4 mg l because heavy metals are consumed in less amount in floriculture industries fig 5 the spatial concentration of heavy metals at the seven cw sites m j et ko aws and du and the level of each heavy metal in the wastewater at each round of sampling were compared fig 5 the removal efficiency of cu by the m z et sh ko aws and dug systems at different sites of the cws systems was in the range of 34 27 64 0 the lowest pb removal efficiency was obtained in 16 32 in et cw systems the highest pb percent removal was recorded in the m cws system 59 51 at p 0 05 the final effluent of cu for all seven cw sites and pb in m j et and sh cws sites were below eepa ethiopian discharge limit values similarly the final outlet discharge effluents for mn concentration m j et sh and ko were below eepa discharge limit values while aws and dug cws sites were above eepa discharge limit values in addition results showed that the removal rates of wastewater pollutants were increased as the hrt increased although the association varied from parameter to parameter in this study among the seven subsurface flow cw cells the dug systems showed relatively higher removal efficiencies than others for most wastewaters the effluents were expected to be highly polluted with pesticides and fertilizer used in the floriculture farm the low qualities of heavy metals indicate that floriculture industry is not a major threat to the water bodies and ecosystems in fact the low amounts available also have an effect on health and the surrounding due to bioaccumulation 4 conclusion the request of operative low cost less energy rigorous and simply operated secondary wastewater treatment methods is an issue of great concern in developing countries the vital outcomes of this study provides a snapshot of the performance of the floriculture cw system in ethiopia based on the results of this study floriculture cws wastewater treatment showed high levels of nh4 n no3 n and tn tp cod and tss in the effluents heavy metals usually present in little concentrations effectively removed from the system meeting national discharge standards the marked variations of effluent concentration were observed within the cw was due to difference in daily activities which includes spraying propagation and cleaning of the houses and containers used in fertilizer and other chemical preparations the assessed flower farm cws were significantly reduced nutrients and organic load in
