20235,semi submersible platforms ssps may subject to excessive wave induced vibrations which should be effectively suppressed in the past decades some vibration control methods have been proposed and developed such as the fixed heave plate fhp and tuned heave plate thp recently the authors proposed using inerter based control device i e rotational inertia dampers rids to control the vibrations of ssps and the control effectiveness has been demonstrated through analytical studies to further investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method wave flume tests are conducted and reported in the present study in particular a 1 70 scaled ssp model was manufactured and the vibration characteristics of the platform were determined firstly through free vibration tests after that the bare and rid equipped ssps were tested under the regular and irregular waves for comparison the ssp equipped with the commonly used fhp was also tested the experimental results demonstrate that both the rid and fhp systems are effective in reducing the heave motion of ssp however compared to the fhp the rid system showed a much better control performance with a very small physical mass the wave flume tests demonstrated the superior vibration control performances of rid on ssp keywords semi submersible platform vibration control wave flume test rotational inertia damper fixed heave plate 1 introduction marine energy plays a significant role in the global energy sector and has attracted increasing interest in the past few decades to exploit the marine energy various types of floating platforms have been designed and built such as the tension leg platform tlp spar type platform and semi submersible platform ssp etc among these platforms ssp is most widely used due to its many merits e g the larger deck area and bigger payload capacity however ssp may subject to excessive motions especially heave motion due to its shallow draft and large pontoons which may cause health and safety problems to operators reduce the platform productivity and even endanger the structural safety it is therefore imperative to effectively suppress the excessive vibrations of ssps extensive research efforts have been dedicated to suppressing the excessive motions of offshore platforms in the past few decades and various vibration control methods have been developed for ssps the heave motion is generally the most crucial and the most commonly used control method is to rigidly install a fixed heave plate fhp to the bottom of a ssp with the aim of increasing the added mass and damping of the platform in this regard thiagarajan and troesch 1998 performed experimental studies to quantify the damping effect of the heave plate it was found that both the drag coefficient and current induced damping were doubled by introducing the heave plate downie et al 2000 conducted wave basin tests to investigate the control effectiveness of the perforated and solid heave plates in the vibration control of a truss spar the results demonstrated that the large solid heave plates were generally more effective since they could generate larger added masses compared to the perforated ones tao and dray 2008 studied the performances of the solid and porous heave plates by the forced oscillation tests it was shown that the solid plates produced higher damping at large keulegan carpenter k c number while the porous plates generated higher damping at very low k c number moreover the motion suppression of a spar with a heave plate was also numerically investigated tao and cai 2004 tao et al 2004 it was shown that the heave plate could result in significant damping effect and its performance could be significantly affected by the geometry configurations e g the aspect ratio and diameter ratio furthermore subbulakshmi and sundaravadivelu 2016 performed detailed parametric studies to investigate the heave damping of a spar type wind turbine with single and two heave plates and various parameters were considered e g the scaling ratio diameter ratio and heave plate position to diameter of heave plate ratio etc they concluded that the heave damping increased with the increment of the scaling ratio and diameter ratio and recommended the optimal ranges for other parameters to more effectively reduce heave motion besides the conventional fhp system tuned heave plate thp was also proposed to mitigate the ssp heave motion based on the concept of tuned mass damper tmd a well known control system that has been widely applied to reduce the structural vibrations induced by many vibration sources such as wind earthquake and wave bi and hao 2016 jangid 1999 kaynia et al 1981 nikoo et al 2018 zuo et al 2017 different from the rigid connection in the fhp system the heave plate in the thp system is connected to ssp via a connection system i e springs in parallel with dampers with such a design the vibration energy of ssp could be transferred to the thp system and then dissipated the control effectiveness of using thp in reducing the ssp motions has also been well verified through experimental and numerical studies liu et al 2016 liu and ou 2016 zhu et al 2012 2016 although both the fhp and thp systems were demonstrated effective large heave plates are normally required for both systems for example as indicated in tao and cai 2004 the fhp extension was suggested at least four times of the heave amplitude of the ssp in order to realize the optimum damping effect as for the thp system it also needs a large heave plate to achieve a large mass ratio between the heave plate and ssp and thus attain a superior control performance liu and ou 2016 however a large heave plate would hinder the extensive applications of these control systems due to the increasing cost and installation difficulties the recently hot debated inerter system might shed some lights on reducing the secondary mass of the conventional fhp and thp systems due to its mass amplification effect the inerter proposed by smith 2002 is a two terminal mechanical element with the capability of generating a resisting force proportional to the relative acceleration between its two terminals in practice inerter can be realized via various means such as rack and pinion papageorgiou et al 2009 fluid de domenico et al 2019 liu et al 2018 wang et al 2010 and ball screw assembly li et al 2012 papageorgiou et al 2009 it was reported in previous studies e g zhu et al 2019 that an inerter could achieve an equivalent mass i e inertance several orders larger than its physical mass due to this significant mass amplification effect inerters have been widely applied in the structural vibration control recently and a number of inerter based dynamic vibration absorbers dvas have been proposed such as tuned viscous mass damper tvmd huang et al 2019 ikago et al 2012 tuned mass damper inerter tmdi giaralis and taflanidis 2018 marian and giaralis 2014 pietrosanti et al 2017 tuned inerter damper tid lazar et al 2014 2016 shen et al 2019 electromagnetic inertial mass dampers eimd li et al 2019 nakamura et al 2014 and tuned tandem mass dampers inerter ttmdi cao and li 2019 etc these inerter based dvas were generally demonstrated more effective than conventional tmds in suppressing the structural vibrations induced by various loads e g wind giaralis and petrini 2017 petrini et al 2020 earthquake zhang et al 2018 2019 and vortex xu et al 2019 2020 etc very recently inerter based control systems were also introduced into the vibration control of offshore platforms subjected to wave or wind loads in this regard hu et al 2018 demonstrated the control effectiveness of using inerter based control systems in suppressing the vibrations of a floating offshore wind turbine fowt subjected to wind and wave loads sarkar and fitzgerald 2019 investigated the effectiveness of using the tmdi in reducing the vibrations of fowt and good control performance was observed ma et al 2018 proposed an inerter based dva namely tuned heave plate inerter thpi to mitigate the heave motion of ssp subjected to wave load it was found that the thpi could further improve the control effectiveness by about 19 compared to the thp system to further improve the control effectiveness ma et al 2019 proposed another inerter based system namely a rotational inertia damper rid for the vibration control of ssp analytical studies showed that the rid system could provide a significant damping effect by amplifying the fluid resistance and realize the same or even better control effectiveness as compared to the fhp by using a much smaller physical mass experimental studies on the rid device itself were also carried out by ma et al 2021 and the results demonstrated the mass amplification and damping effects of the device very recently ma et al 2020a further applied an inerter based vibration isolation system ivis to mitigate the heave motion of ssp analytical results showed that by introducing a parallel connected inerter the reduction ratio of the receiving body the top part of a ssp could be further improved by more than 23 the above literature review reveals that some research efforts have been made to control the excessive motions of offshore platforms however most previous studies focused on analytical hu et al 2018 sarkar and fitzgerald 2019 or numerical tao and cai 2004 tao et al 2004 investigations and very limited experimental works downie et al 2000 tao and dray 2008 thiagarajan and troesch 1998 have been carried out as an extension of the authors previous studies ma et al 2019 2020b 2021 2020b this paper aims to experimentally investigate the feasibility and control effectiveness of using rid system in reducing the heave motion of ssp wave flume tests were designed and performed in the present study in particular a 1 70 scaled ssp model was manufactured and the vibration characteristics of the platform were determined firstly through free vibration tests after that the bare ssp and the ssp equipped with rid ssp rid were tested under the regular and irregular waves for comparison the ssp equipped with the commonly used fhp ssp fhp was also tested the remaining of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 some basic knowledge about rid is firstly introduced section 3 presents the experimental setup which includes the description of the scaled model mooring system control devices instrumentations and test programs section 4 introduces the experimental results in particular the heave motion responses of the ssp without control and controlled by the rid and fhp systems are reported finally the conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 rotational inertia damper prior to discussing the setup and results of wave flume tests some basic knowledge about rid including the working mechanism mechanical model and feasibility etc is firstly introduced in this section for a better understanding of the physical performance of rid fig 1 shows the schematic drawing of rid as shown the key component of a rid is a set of ball screw assembly which can transform the linear motion into the high speed rotation of the rotating tube and thus the rotations of the turning plates immersed in the water during this motion conversion process the turning plates could generate a considerable damping effect against the device motion by churning the surrounding water to capture the behaviors of rid a nonlinear mechanical model considering various nonlinearities e g the parasitic damping was proposed in ma et al 2021 and it can be expressed as follows 1 f n m e m i x d n c e x d x d f c sgn x d c v x d where 2a m e 1 3 η 2 π l 2 ρ c m ρ s l t p t t p r 1 3 r 0 3 2b c e 1 8 η 2 π l 3 ρ c d l t p r 1 4 r 0 4 in which n is the number of turning plates m e is the inertance i e equivalent mass of rid c e is the damping coefficient of rid m i is the equivalent mass due to the original structural mass and moment of inertia in the rid f c is the coulomb friction c v is the viscous friction coefficient sgn is the signum function η is the conversion efficiency of the ball screw which is used to estimate how well a ball screw transforms linear motion into rotational motion l is the lead of ball screw r 0 is the inner radius of turning plates r 1 is the outer radius of turning plates ρ is the density of water ρ s is the density of steel c m is the inertia coefficient of turning plate c d is the drag coefficient of turning plate l t p and t t p are the width and thickness of the turning plate respectively x d and x d are the relative velocity and acceleration between two terminals respectively in order to assess this mechanical model a rid prototype was manufactured and tested under a series of sinusoidal excitations by ma et al 2021 and experimental results were then compared with those predicted by equation 1 fig 2 shows the comparisons between the experimental and theoretical hysteretic curves of rid under two typical sinusoidal excitations with different amplitudes a and frequencies f as shown good agreements were achieved between the experimental and theoretical results indicating that the mechanical model shown in equation 1 is accurate to predict the behaviors of rid moreover the experimental hysteretic curves of rid in fig 2 roughly showed an inclined elliptical shape with large enclosed areas demonstrating that the rid system has a good capacity of dissipating vibration energy furthermore it was also found in ma et al 2021 that the mechanical behaviors of rid were governed by the nonlinear damping force namely the second term in equation 1 and the influences of inerter nonlinearities on the performance of rid were relatively obvious for low frequency or low amplitude excitation and decreased with the increment of the excitation frequency or amplitude more detailed information can be found in ma et al 2021 after identifying the performance of rid the next step is to investigate the feasibility and realistic control effectiveness of rid when it is applied to a floating platform which is the primary work of this paper and will be introduced in the following sections it is worth mentioning that some differences exist between the rid prototypes developed in ma et al 2021 and this paper e g the connecting joints and sizes of the external tube and turning plates etc since some modifications were required to fit the scaled ssp in the wave flume tests in this study however the major findings reported in ma et al 2021 are still applicable for the rid used in this study since the working mechanisms are exactly the same and differences are mainly on the dimensions of the external tube and turning plates another issue is the feasibility of practically applying the rid device in engineering practices ma et al 2019 analysed this issue in detail and concluded that the proposed method has obvious advantages and thus great application potentials when the platform is deployed at a site with a water depth ranging from 450 to 1000 feet the proposed method could achieve the similar or even better control effectiveness by using a very small rid mass compared to the conventional fhp system ma et al 2019 2020c 2020c in other words the proposed system will also be more economic compared to the fhp system given these facts the rid is believed to have great application potentials in engineering practices 3 setup of wave flume tests wave flume tests were performed in the nonlinear wave flume in the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology p r china fig 3 a shows a photo of the wave flume the wave flume is 60 m long 4 m wide and 2 5 m deep and the maximum working depth is 2 0 m a motor driven piston type wavemaker is equipped at one end of the flume which is capable of generating regular and irregular waves a beach made with plastic horsehair is fixed at the other end of the wave flume to absorb incoming waves considering the dimension of the wave flume and the dimension of the selected ssp the geometric scaling ratio of ssp was set at 1 70 and the water depth was fixed to 1 40 m which corresponds to a water depth of about 100 m at full scale according to the froude scaling law 3 1 scaled ssp model a typical ssp fan et al 2017 consisting of one deck two pontoons four columns and four cross braces was selected as the objective ssp in this study the length width and depth of the ssp are 114 07 m 78 64 m and 38 6 m respectively and its displacement i e the total mass is 48206 8 tonnes an overview of the dimensions and properties of the platform are tabulated in table 1 the dimensions of the model after scaling are also shown in the table fig 3 b shows the scaled ssp model in the wave flume the model was made of steel and designed to be very stiff which could be considered as a rigid body with six degree of freedom 6 dof in the water it should be noted that the scaled model was placed in the middle of the wave flume to reduce the impact of reflected waves during the tests and the longer side of the platform was along the longitudinal direction of the flume in addition the incident angle of the wave was along the longitudinal direction of the flume i e the incident angle of the wave to the platform was 0 3 2 mooring system for the scaled model a set of mooring system consisting of four steel wires with flexible springs was adopted according to fan et al 2017 with the aim of avoiding the ssp model drifting away during the tests table 2 summarizes the properties of the mooring system in the prototype and the scaled model and fig 4 shows the schematic layout as shown in fig 4 a these mooring lines were positioned almost 90 apart each of them firstly passed through a v shape fixed pulley mounted at the anchor point and then connected to a spring a load cell and a tensioner that was fixed to a rigid steel frame as shown in fig 4 b specifically the flexible springs were utilized to represent the stiffness of the mooring lines the tensioners were installed to slightly adjust the initial length i e the initial force of the mooring lines when necessary the load cells were deployed to measure the forces in the mooring lines which will be presented in section 3 4 it is worth mentioning that ball bearings were utilized as axles inside the pulleys to minimize the influence of additional friction due to the introduction of ball bearings the additional friction sourced from pulleys could be effectively reduced therefore its influence was limited and could be ignored during the tests 3 3 rid and fhp as indicated in the introduction the primary objective of this paper is to experimentally investigate the control effectiveness of the rid and fhp systems in reducing the motions of the scaled ssp subjected to wave loads it is well known that compared to the other motions the heave motion is generally the most crucial and dominates the vibrations of a ssp since its natural period is the closest to the dominant period of the wave which will also be demonstrated in section 4 2 given this fact only the heave motion was of interest in the tests and a single rid and a single fhp were mounted to the scaled model respectively a rid device similar to the one experimentally investigated by the authors in ma et al 2021 was manufactured and table 3 lists the detailed specifications of the rid in particular a ball screw assembly made by the tbi motion model no sfv01210 was adopted to convert the linear motion to the rotations of two turning plates see fig 6 a and all components of the device were made of stainless steel to enhance corrosion resistance and durability the outer diameter length and stroke of the rid were 60 mm 660 mm and 250 mm respectively the mass of the turning plates was 0 013 kg while the physical and underwater masses of rid namely m a i r and m w in table 3 were 3 3 kg and 2 9 kg respectively it should be noted that the physical and underwater masses refer to the mass of rid in the air and water respectively and the underwater mass of rid is estimated by using a hydrostatic method i e m w m a i r ρ s ρ ρ s to make the rid effective one end of the rid was fixed to the ground of the wave flume and the other end was fixed to the platform through the ball hinges at the two ends of the rid see fig 5 as suggested in the authors previous study ma et al 2019 it should be noted that to avoid the possible eccentric load the rid was installed in the middle of the platform through a cross beam as shown in fig 5 in addition a waterproof load cell was attached to measure the resulted axial force fig 6 shows the on site photos of the rid and the scaled model equipped with the rid as for the fhp an aluminum alloy heave plate with a dimension of 0 4 m 0 4 m 0 01 m and a mass of 4 2 kg was manufactured similarly the underwater mass of the fhp is also calculated which is 2 7 kg figs 7 and 8 show the schematic drawing and on site photos respectively as shown the fhp system was placed under the platform and rigidly connected to the scaled model via a connecting rod similarly the fhp system was also installed centrally through the cross beam more detailed information about the fhp system can be found in table 3 3 4 instrumentations the instruments utilized in the wave flume tests are shown in fig 4 two wave probes were installed at the front and rear of the scaled model to measure wave elevation four load cells attached to the mooring lines were used to measure the tension forces of the mooring lines during the tests moreover another load cell was utilized to measure the axial force when the ssp was equipped with the rid as shown in fig 6 b these measured forces were collected and recorded by a data acquisition system furthermore an optical motion capture system namely ndi optotrak certus see fig 8 was utilized to measure the 6 dof motions of the scaled model this system was capable of precisely capturing the instantaneous positions of the ssp model by installing a planar rigid body with four infrared markers on the model see fig 8 all the measuring devices were calibrated before performing tests and the acquisition frequency was set to 100 hz 3 5 test programs in the present study the wave flume tests were divided into four parts 1 wave calibrations 2 free vibration tests 3 regular wave tests and 4 irregular wave tests in particular the wave calibration tests were performed to ensure the accuracy of the generated waves and the free vibration tests were applied to determine the natural periods of the scaled model in the regular wave tests a total of 14 regular waves were considered with the scaled frequencies ranging from 0 837 rad s to 7 530 rad s table 4 gives the amplitudes and frequencies periods of the full scale and scaled regular waves as shown the amplitude of the scaled regular waves was taken to be 60 mm for r1 r9 and decreased to 30 mm when the excitation frequency was larger than 4 602 rad s i e r10 r14 due to the power limitation of the wavemaker it should be noted that this frequency range namely 0 1 0 9 rad s at the full scale was chosen due to the following reasons 1 this paper focuses on the heave motion mitigation of ssp with different control systems to better demonstrate the control effectiveness the heave natural frequency of ssp should fall inside the selected frequency range of regular waves to ensure that resonance occurs in the heave direction for the chosen ssp prototype the natural heave frequency is 0 289 rad s which is inside the selected frequency range namely 0 1 0 9 rad s moreover as will be shown in the rao curves see fig 13 the heave raos are much larger at low frequencies compared to those at high frequencies therefore the heave motion of ssp at low frequencies deserves more attentions 2 this frequency range was also chosen based on the capacity of the wave flume for the adopted wave flume the highest working frequency is 2 hz corresponding to 1 5 rad s in the real situation beyond which the accuracy of the generated waves will be degraded in the irregular wave tests two irregular waves listed in table 5 were considered which correspond to the waves in the south china sea ir1 and the gulf of mexico ir2 respectively with a one year return period the irregular waves were simulated based on the joint north sea wave project jonswap spectrum defined as follows hasselmann et al 1973 3 s ω a h s 2 ω 5 ω 0 4 exp 1 25 ω ω 0 4 γ w exp ω ω 0 2 2 τ 2 ω 0 2 in which s ω is the power spectral density psd function of the jonswap spectrum h s is the significant wave height and ω 0 is the wave peak frequency which can be calculated based on t 0 tabulated in table 5 ω is the wave frequency and 4 a 0 0624 0 230 0 0336 γ w 0 185 1 9 γ w 1 where γ w is the peakedness factor with an average value of 3 3 chakrabarti 1987 τ is the shape parameter and it equals to 0 07 when ω ω 0 and 0 09 when ω ω 0 chakrabarti 1987 in order to meet the requirement of ergodicity the total duration of each irregular wave was 1260 s which corresponds to about 3 h at the full scale meanwhile each irregular wave was further divided into seven short sub waves with a duration of 180 s to reduce the annoying reflection effect of the wave flume in other words each irregular wave included seven 180 s sub waves that were all compatible with the given jonswap spectra it is worth mentioning that this method namely dividing the entire irregular wave into short sub waves is actually widely adopted in wave flume basin tests to ensure the accuracy of incident waves goda and suzuki 1976 in addition the water surface was waited to be calm before the subsequent test to avoid the influence from the prior test 4 experimental results and discussions 4 1 wave calibrations in practice certain discrepancies unavoidably exist between the theoretical and actually generated waves to evaluate the quality of the generated waves calibrations were performed for the regular and irregular waves notably the wave calibration tests were conducted in the absence of the ssp model 4 1 1 regular waves two regular waves i e r6 and r10 are taken out as examples to illustrate the quality of the generated regular waves fig 9 shows the theoretical and measured wave elevation time histories of the two regular waves it should be noted that the measured wave elevation time histories include two parts i e unstable and stable responses see fig 9 only the stable response would be utilized in the following analyses generally speaking despite some minor discrepancies very good repeatability was observed in the stable range between the theoretical and measured waves in terms of amplitudes and periods table 6 compares the frequencies and amplitudes of all the regular wave cases and the corresponding differences are also tabulated in the table it can be seen that most of the amplitude differences were less than 10 except r2 r5 and r10 and all the frequency differences were less than 0 56 which demonstrate the good quality of the regular waves in addition it is worth mentioning that the relatively large discrepancies in r2 r5 and r10 do not influence the response amplitude operators raos in section 4 3 since the measured amplitude rather than the theoretical amplitude of the regular waves will be utilized in the calculation 4 1 2 irregular waves fig 10 illustrates the wave elevation time histories of irregular waves ir1 1 and ir2 1 and table 7 compares the statistics of the theoretical and all the measured irregular waves notably the name i r i j i 1 2 and j 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 denotes the j t h sub wave of the i t h irregular wave to quantify the quality of the irregular waves the significant wave height h 1 3 and significant wave period t 1 3 of the measured irregular waves are calculated as follows 5 h 1 3 1 n 3 i 1 n 3 h i 6 t 1 3 1 n 3 i 1 n 3 t i in which n is the number of waves in the record h i is a series of wave height ranked from the highest to the lowest t i is the wave period corresponding to the i th wave height h i for the theoretical values they are tabulated in table 5 as discussed above table 7 summarizes the significant wave height and significant wave period of all the 7 sub waves of each irregular wave and the corresponding differences are also listed in the table it can be seen that the differences of the significant wave height and significant wave period for ir1 were less than 7 47 and 1 35 respectively as for ir2 the differences of the significant wave height and significant wave period were less than 3 39 and 3 89 respectively fig 11 shows the comparison between the theoretical equation 3 and measured wave spectra similarly good agreements are obtained as well the above comparisons demonstrate the good quality of the generated irregular waves 4 2 free vibration tests as calculated in table 2 when the ssp is in the original balanced position the initial force in each mooring line should be 5 83 n before the free vibration test the initial forces in the mooring lines were measured and table 8 lists the results as shown the measured initial forces were 5 52 5 42 5 08 and 5 61 n for lines 1 2 3 and 4 respectively which were slightly smaller than the theoretical value with a maximum difference of 12 84 these discrepancies might be caused by the facts that 1 the four mooring lines were not exactly symmetrical see fig 4 a and 2 the stiffness of the springs could not be exactly the same fig 4 b since the aim of the present study is to investigate the effectiveness of applying different control systems for ssp heave motion mitigation and the influence of these discrepancies does not affect the evaluation of the control effectiveness therefore no further action was made to adjust the initial mooring line forces the free vibration tests were then carried out in the calm water to determine the natural periods of the scaled ssp in the six directions see fig 3 b in particular the scaled model was applied a displacement angle at a specific dof and then released suddenly to let ssp oscillate freely the motion time histories of free oscillations were captured by ndi and the fast fourier transform fft technique was then utilized to identify the natural periods table 9 lists the natural periods identified from the free vibration tests as shown the full scale natural period of ssp in the heave direction is 21 79 s which is close to the ocean wave period band normally ranging from 5 s to 20 s pham and shin 2019 this fact indicates that the heave motion is the most crucial for this platform which is also the reason why the heave motion mitigation is of interest in this study moreover it is also found that all the six natural periods of ssp satisfy the requirements recommended by det norske veritas dnv as required in det norske veritas dnv 2011 the natural periods for a large moored floating platform in the surge sway and yaw directions are typically more than 100 s and the natural periods in the heave roll and pitch directions are usually above 20 s this fact demonstrates that the designed ssp is reasonable and can represent the common case of floating platforms in practices 4 3 regular wave tests regular wave tests were performed to evaluate the control effectiveness of the rid and fhp systems in reducing the heave motion of the ssp model under regular waves for comparison the bare ssp i e the ssp model without control was also tested fig 12 shows the results when the ssp model was subjected to regular waves r6 and r10 as shown both the rid and fhp systems were effective in reducing the heave motion of the ssp and the rid system was more effective in particular the peak heave motions of the bare ssp ssp rid and ssp fhp were respectively 22 49 mm 14 29 mm and 19 91 mm for r6 as for r10 the peak heave motion of the bare ssp was 11 33 mm which was reduced to 9 25 mm and 10 30 mm by introducing the rid and fhp systems respectively in other words compared to the bare ssp the reduction ratios for the rid and fhp systems were 36 5 and 11 5 respectively in case r6 and 18 4 and 9 1 respectively for case r10 for floating platforms the response amplitude operator rao is commonly used to evaluate the behaviors of platform which is defined as 7 r a o ω a ξ a in which a is the motion amplitude and ξ a is the wave amplitude at a specific wave incident frequency ω it should be noted that the amplitude of the wave was not stable at the beginning see fig 9 the rao values are determined when a and ξ a reached the steady range of the time histories as mentioned above fig 13 shows the heave rao curves of the scaled model without and with different control systems as shown in table 4 the excitation frequencies of the regular waves varied from 0 84 rad s to 7 53 rad s and as obtained in the free vibration tests the natural frequency of the bare ssp model in the heave direction was 2 41 rad s which is shown by the black dashed line in this figure it can be seen from fig 13 that for the bare ssp an obvious peak occurred at 2 09 rad s due to the fact that this excitation frequency was close to the natural vibration frequency of the ssp 2 41 rad s and resonance occurred in the pre peak region i e 0 84 rad s 2 09 rad s the rao values increased with the increment of the excitation frequency and tended to be unity at very low excitation frequencies in the post peak region i e 2 09 rad s 7 53 rad s the rao values decreased obviously especially in the range that is around the natural frequency of the ssp it should be noted that another wave with the excitation frequency very close to the natural frequency of the ssp was also tested 2 51 rad s in case r5 though this frequency was even closer to 2 41 rad s compared to case r4 with the excitation frequency of 2 09 rad s the peak rao value however did not occur in this case this is because as numerically demonstrated by the authors ma et al 2020a the rao curve varies sharply around the natural frequency of the ssp namely very significant change occurs within a very narrow excitation frequency range it is believed that even larger rao value could be obtained if the ssp was excited by a wave with the frequency between 2 09 rad s case r4 and 2 41 rad s and the excitation frequency is closer to 2 41 rad s the larger rao value would be obtained fig 13 also shows that for the ssp fhp system an obvious peak was also observed at 2 09 rad s which was caused by the resonance in the heave direction by introducing the fhp system the heave raos were slightly reduced when the wave excitation frequency was larger than 2 09 rad s it should be noted that as mentioned above the ocean wave period band normally ranges from 5 s to 20 s which corresponds to 2 63 rad s to 10 51 rad s for the scaled model which is displayed by the grey shaded area in the figure in other words the experimental results showed that the heave motion could be generally mitigated within the normal wave excitation range however it is also found that the heave raos of the ssp fhp system were slightly increased in the pre peak region this is because the fhp system increased the total mass and thus reduced the natural frequency of the scaled model which in turn amplified the raos in the pre peak region fig 13 also displays the rao curve of the scaled ssp with the rid system it should be noted that the data for cases r1 and r2 are not available because the motions of ssp exceeded the maximum stroke of rid i e 250 mm in table 3 under these two regular waves it is found that when rid was applied the heave motion could be obviously mitigated especially when the excitation frequency was relatively small smaller than 5 rad s as shown and the rid system was more effective compared to the fhp system the superior control effectiveness of rid was attributed to its superior energy dissipation capacity as discussed in section 2 4 4 irregular wave tests in this subsection the control effectiveness of the rid and fhp systems under irregular waves are investigated similarly the bare ssp model was also tested for comparison figs 14 and 15 show the example heave motion time histories of the scaled model without and with different control systems under irregular waves ir1 and ir2 respectively it should be noted that only the first and second sub waves of each irregular wave are taken out for illustration for the other sub waves similar trends were observed as shown in the figures both the rid and fhp systems could suppress the heave motion of the ssp and the rid system was more effective to quantitatively evaluate the control effectiveness besides the maximum heave motion the heave motion standard deviation σ is also calculated 8 σ z i μ 2 n in which z i is the recorded heave motion n is the number of data points μ is the mean of z i i 1 2 3 n tables 10 and 11 tabulate the results and the corresponding reduction ratios are also calculated and summarized in the tables in which ψ m a x is the reduction ratio for the maximum response and ψ σ corresponds to the reduction ratio for the standard deviation in addition to minimize the influence of the unstable waves see fig 10 the steady responses with duration of 180 s were extracted for the statistical results of each sub wave the statistical results of the ssp model without and with different control systems under ir1 are listed in table 10 it can be seen that both the maximum response and standard deviation under each sub wave could be suppressed by using the rid or fhp system and the rid system performed better under all the sub waves in particular the average value of the maximum responses of the bare ssp was 25 52 mm which was reduced to 20 10 mm and 23 07 mm by introducing the rid and fhp systems respectively the corresponding average reduction ratios were 21 24 and 9 60 respectively for the standard deviation the average reduction ratios of the rid and fhp systems were 27 07 and 10 69 respectively similar results are shown in table 11 which tabulates the results when the ssps were subjected to ir2 it can be seen that in average when fhp was installed the maximum response and standard deviation of the heave motion could be reduced by 14 45 and 11 74 respectively when rid was installed the corresponding results were 28 27 and 38 72 respectively the above results clearly demonstrate the control effectiveness of the rid system in reducing the heave motion of the ssp to further investigate the control effectiveness figs 16 and 17 present the heave motion psds of the scaled model without and with different control systems under irregular waves ir1 and ir2 respectively in general similar to the time domain results shown in figs 14 and 15 both the rid and fhp systems could reduce the heave motion psd of the ssp model and the control effectiveness of the rid system was more significant for the bare ssp model the psd curve showed a two peak characteristic the first peak occurred around 2 4 rad s which corresponds to the natural frequency of the scaled model in the heave direction as for the second peak it was caused by the dominant frequency of the wave see fig 11 and obviously higher than the first one this fact indicates that the heave motion of the ssp mainly came from the rigid body motion induced by the waves rather than the resonance of the ssp similar results were found in qiao and ou 2012 by introducing the control systems especially the rid system both the two peaks of psd curves were significantly suppressed which demonstrates the control effectiveness of the rid and fhp systems moreover it is also found that the first peak of psd curve moved leftward after installing the control systems this means that the natural frequency of the scaled model in the heave direction was reduced by both the rid and fhp systems however the working mechanisms of these two control systems are different specifically speaking the fhp system increased the effective mass and thus decreased the natural frequency of the scaled model as for the rid system it decreased the natural frequency of the ssp mainly due to its negative stiffness effect different from the positive stiffness provided by springs the negative stiffness produced by the rid could reduce the global stiffness and thus decrease the natural frequency of the ssp furthermore it is worth mentioning again that the physical mass of turning plates was only 0 013 kg in the tests this fact demonstrates that the rid system could achieve good control performance by using turning plates with very small physical mass which is consistent with the finding obtained in the previous analytical studies ma et al 2019 2020b 2020b fig 18 shows the measured force time histories of the rid system under irregular waves ir1 1 and ir2 1 it should be noted that only the results within the stable range 20 200 s are given and the force time histories of the fhp system are not given since they were not measured during the tests as shown the maximum control forces of the rid system under ir1 1 and ir2 1 were 116 7 n and 62 3 n respectively it is obvious that the maximum control force of the rid system under ir1 1 was larger than that under ir2 1 this is because the control force of rid is primarily governed by the nonlinear damping force proportional to the squared velocity see equation 1 and the ssp model under ir1 1 has larger heave motions and velocities which thus lead to the larger control forces 5 conclusions this paper presented the wave flume tests of a ssp subjected to the wave load with the aim of demonstrating the feasibility and control effectiveness of the rid and fhp systems in reducing the ssp heave motion a 1 70 scaled ssp model was manufactured and the vibration characteristics of the platform were determined firstly through free vibration tests then the bare ssp ssp rid and ssp fhp were tested under regular and irregular waves respectively based on the experimental results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the rid system is feasible and effective in reducing the heave motion of ssp by using turning plates with very small physical mass which provides an attractive alternative for the vibration control of offshore platforms 2 the conventional fhp system was effective in reducing the heave motion of ssp for the regular waves the heave raos in the normal wave excitation range was slightly reduced as for the irregular waves both the peak and standard deviation of the heave motion are mitigated and the maximum reduction ratios of 14 45 for the maximum response and 11 74 for the standard deviation were realized 3 compared to the fhp system the rid system was more effective in reducing the heave motion of the ssp for the regular waves the heave raos are obviously reduced especially when the excitation frequency was relatively small for the irregular waves both the peak and standard deviation of the heave motion were mitigated more effectively and the maximum reduction ratios of 28 27 for the maximum response and 38 72 for the standard deviation were achieved in the present study the effectiveness of using the rid system for the offshore platform vibration control has been demonstrated through wave flume tests in practice other parameters may influence the control effectiveness e g the possible friction in the mechanical structures the masses of the heave plate and rid the modelling of the irregular waves etc the influences of these parameters will be further investigated through numerical simulations and analytical derivations in future studies to establish guides for practical implementations of rid

20235,semi submersible platforms ssps may subject to excessive wave induced vibrations which should be effectively suppressed in the past decades some vibration control methods have been proposed and developed such as the fixed heave plate fhp and tuned heave plate thp recently the authors proposed using inerter based control device i e rotational inertia dampers rids to control the vibrations of ssps and the control effectiveness has been demonstrated through analytical studies to further investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method wave flume tests are conducted and reported in the present study in particular a 1 70 scaled ssp model was manufactured and the vibration characteristics of the platform were determined firstly through free vibration tests after that the bare and rid equipped ssps were tested under the regular and irregular waves for comparison the ssp equipped with the commonly used fhp was also tested the experimental results demonstrate that both the rid and fhp systems are effective in reducing the heave motion of ssp however compared to the fhp the rid system showed a much better control performance with a very small physical mass the wave flume tests demonstrated the superior vibration control performances of rid on ssp keywords semi submersible platform vibration control wave flume test rotational inertia damper fixed heave plate 1 introduction marine energy plays a significant role in the global energy sector and has attracted increasing interest in the past few decades to exploit the marine energy various types of floating platforms have been designed and built such as the tension leg platform tlp spar type platform and semi submersible platform ssp etc among these platforms ssp is most widely used due to its many merits e g the larger deck area and bigger payload capacity however ssp may subject to excessive motions especially heave motion due to its shallow draft and large pontoons which may cause health and safety problems to operators reduce the platform productivity and even endanger the structural safety it is therefore imperative to effectively suppress the excessive vibrations of ssps extensive research efforts have been dedicated to suppressing the excessive motions of offshore platforms in the past few decades and various vibration control methods have been developed for ssps the heave motion is generally the most crucial and the most commonly used control method is to rigidly install a fixed heave plate fhp to the bottom of a ssp with the aim of increasing the added mass and damping of the platform in this regard thiagarajan and troesch 1998 performed experimental studies to quantify the damping effect of the heave plate it was found that both the drag coefficient and current induced damping were doubled by introducing the heave plate downie et al 2000 conducted wave basin tests to investigate the control effectiveness of the perforated and solid heave plates in the vibration control of a truss spar the results demonstrated that the large solid heave plates were generally more effective since they could generate larger added masses compared to the perforated ones tao and dray 2008 studied the performances of the solid and porous heave plates by the forced oscillation tests it was shown that the solid plates produced higher damping at large keulegan carpenter k c number while the porous plates generated higher damping at very low k c number moreover the motion suppression of a spar with a heave plate was also numerically investigated tao and cai 2004 tao et al 2004 it was shown that the heave plate could result in significant damping effect and its performance could be significantly affected by the geometry configurations e g the aspect ratio and diameter ratio furthermore subbulakshmi and sundaravadivelu 2016 performed detailed parametric studies to investigate the heave damping of a spar type wind turbine with single and two heave plates and various parameters were considered e g the scaling ratio diameter ratio and heave plate position to diameter of heave plate ratio etc they concluded that the heave damping increased with the increment of the scaling ratio and diameter ratio and recommended the optimal ranges for other parameters to more effectively reduce heave motion besides the conventional fhp system tuned heave plate thp was also proposed to mitigate the ssp heave motion based on the concept of tuned mass damper tmd a well known control system that has been widely applied to reduce the structural vibrations induced by many vibration sources such as wind earthquake and wave bi and hao 2016 jangid 1999 kaynia et al 1981 nikoo et al 2018 zuo et al 2017 different from the rigid connection in the fhp system the heave plate in the thp system is connected to ssp via a connection system i e springs in parallel with dampers with such a design the vibration energy of ssp could be transferred to the thp system and then dissipated the control effectiveness of using thp in reducing the ssp motions has also been well verified through experimental and numerical studies liu et al 2016 liu and ou 2016 zhu et al 2012 2016 although both the fhp and thp systems were demonstrated effective large heave plates are normally required for both systems for example as indicated in tao and cai 2004 the fhp extension was suggested at least four times of the heave amplitude of the ssp in order to realize the optimum damping effect as for the thp system it also needs a large heave plate to achieve a large mass ratio between the heave plate and ssp and thus attain a superior control performance liu and ou 2016 however a large heave plate would hinder the extensive applications of these control systems due to the increasing cost and installation difficulties the recently hot debated inerter system might shed some lights on reducing the secondary mass of the conventional fhp and thp systems due to its mass amplification effect the inerter proposed by smith 2002 is a two terminal mechanical element with the capability of generating a resisting force proportional to the relative acceleration between its two terminals in practice inerter can be realized via various means such as rack and pinion papageorgiou et al 2009 fluid de domenico et al 2019 liu et al 2018 wang et al 2010 and ball screw assembly li et al 2012 papageorgiou et al 2009 it was reported in previous studies e g zhu et al 2019 that an inerter could achieve an equivalent mass i e inertance several orders larger than its physical mass due to this significant mass amplification effect inerters have been widely applied in the structural vibration control recently and a number of inerter based dynamic vibration absorbers dvas have been proposed such as tuned viscous mass damper tvmd huang et al 2019 ikago et al 2012 tuned mass damper inerter tmdi giaralis and taflanidis 2018 marian and giaralis 2014 pietrosanti et al 2017 tuned inerter damper tid lazar et al 2014 2016 shen et al 2019 electromagnetic inertial mass dampers eimd li et al 2019 nakamura et al 2014 and tuned tandem mass dampers inerter ttmdi cao and li 2019 etc these inerter based dvas were generally demonstrated more effective than conventional tmds in suppressing the structural vibrations induced by various loads e g wind giaralis and petrini 2017 petrini et al 2020 earthquake zhang et al 2018 2019 and vortex xu et al 2019 2020 etc very recently inerter based control systems were also introduced into the vibration control of offshore platforms subjected to wave or wind loads in this regard hu et al 2018 demonstrated the control effectiveness of using inerter based control systems in suppressing the vibrations of a floating offshore wind turbine fowt subjected to wind and wave loads sarkar and fitzgerald 2019 investigated the effectiveness of using the tmdi in reducing the vibrations of fowt and good control performance was observed ma et al 2018 proposed an inerter based dva namely tuned heave plate inerter thpi to mitigate the heave motion of ssp subjected to wave load it was found that the thpi could further improve the control effectiveness by about 19 compared to the thp system to further improve the control effectiveness ma et al 2019 proposed another inerter based system namely a rotational inertia damper rid for the vibration control of ssp analytical studies showed that the rid system could provide a significant damping effect by amplifying the fluid resistance and realize the same or even better control effectiveness as compared to the fhp by using a much smaller physical mass experimental studies on the rid device itself were also carried out by ma et al 2021 and the results demonstrated the mass amplification and damping effects of the device very recently ma et al 2020a further applied an inerter based vibration isolation system ivis to mitigate the heave motion of ssp analytical results showed that by introducing a parallel connected inerter the reduction ratio of the receiving body the top part of a ssp could be further improved by more than 23 the above literature review reveals that some research efforts have been made to control the excessive motions of offshore platforms however most previous studies focused on analytical hu et al 2018 sarkar and fitzgerald 2019 or numerical tao and cai 2004 tao et al 2004 investigations and very limited experimental works downie et al 2000 tao and dray 2008 thiagarajan and troesch 1998 have been carried out as an extension of the authors previous studies ma et al 2019 2020b 2021 2020b this paper aims to experimentally investigate the feasibility and control effectiveness of using rid system in reducing the heave motion of ssp wave flume tests were designed and performed in the present study in particular a 1 70 scaled ssp model was manufactured and the vibration characteristics of the platform were determined firstly through free vibration tests after that the bare ssp and the ssp equipped with rid ssp rid were tested under the regular and irregular waves for comparison the ssp equipped with the commonly used fhp ssp fhp was also tested the remaining of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 some basic knowledge about rid is firstly introduced section 3 presents the experimental setup which includes the description of the scaled model mooring system control devices instrumentations and test programs section 4 introduces the experimental results in particular the heave motion responses of the ssp without control and controlled by the rid and fhp systems are reported finally the conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 rotational inertia damper prior to discussing the setup and results of wave flume tests some basic knowledge about rid including the working mechanism mechanical model and feasibility etc is firstly introduced in this section for a better understanding of the physical performance of rid fig 1 shows the schematic drawing of rid as shown the key component of a rid is a set of ball screw assembly which can transform the linear motion into the high speed rotation of the rotating tube and thus the rotations of the turning plates immersed in the water during this motion conversion process the turning plates could generate a considerable damping effect against the device motion by churning the surrounding water to capture the behaviors of rid a nonlinear mechanical model considering various nonlinearities e g the parasitic damping was proposed in ma et al 2021 and it can be expressed as follows 1 f n m e m i x d n c e x d x d f c sgn x d c v x d where 2a m e 1 3 η 2 π l 2 ρ c m ρ s l t p t t p r 1 3 r 0 3 2b c e 1 8 η 2 π l 3 ρ c d l t p r 1 4 r 0 4 in which n is the number of turning plates m e is the inertance i e equivalent mass of rid c e is the damping coefficient of rid m i is the equivalent mass due to the original structural mass and moment of inertia in the rid f c is the coulomb friction c v is the viscous friction coefficient sgn is the signum function η is the conversion efficiency of the ball screw which is used to estimate how well a ball screw transforms linear motion into rotational motion l is the lead of ball screw r 0 is the inner radius of turning plates r 1 is the outer radius of turning plates ρ is the density of water ρ s is the density of steel c m is the inertia coefficient of turning plate c d is the drag coefficient of turning plate l t p and t t p are the width and thickness of the turning plate respectively x d and x d are the relative velocity and acceleration between two terminals respectively in order to assess this mechanical model a rid prototype was manufactured and tested under a series of sinusoidal excitations by ma et al 2021 and experimental results were then compared with those predicted by equation 1 fig 2 shows the comparisons between the experimental and theoretical hysteretic curves of rid under two typical sinusoidal excitations with different amplitudes a and frequencies f as shown good agreements were achieved between the experimental and theoretical results indicating that the mechanical model shown in equation 1 is accurate to predict the behaviors of rid moreover the experimental hysteretic curves of rid in fig 2 roughly showed an inclined elliptical shape with large enclosed areas demonstrating that the rid system has a good capacity of dissipating vibration energy furthermore it was also found in ma et al 2021 that the mechanical behaviors of rid were governed by the nonlinear damping force namely the second term in equation 1 and the influences of inerter nonlinearities on the performance of rid were relatively obvious for low frequency or low amplitude excitation and decreased with the increment of the excitation frequency or amplitude more detailed information can be found in ma et al 2021 after identifying the performance of rid the next step is to investigate the feasibility and realistic control effectiveness of rid when it is applied to a floating platform which is the primary work of this paper and will be introduced in the following sections it is worth mentioning that some differences exist between the rid prototypes developed in ma et al 2021 and this paper e g the connecting joints and sizes of the external tube and turning plates etc since some modifications were required to fit the scaled ssp in the wave flume tests in this study however the major findings reported in ma et al 2021 are still applicable for the rid used in this study since the working mechanisms are exactly the same and differences are mainly on the dimensions of the external tube and turning plates another issue is the feasibility of practically applying the rid device in engineering practices ma et al 2019 analysed this issue in detail and concluded that the proposed method has obvious advantages and thus great application potentials when the platform is deployed at a site with a water depth ranging from 450 to 1000 feet the proposed method could achieve the similar or even better control effectiveness by using a very small rid mass compared to the conventional fhp system ma et al 2019 2020c 2020c in other words the proposed system will also be more economic compared to the fhp system given these facts the rid is believed to have great application potentials in engineering practices 3 setup of wave flume tests wave flume tests were performed in the nonlinear wave flume in the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology p r china fig 3 a shows a photo of the wave flume the wave flume is 60 m long 4 m wide and 2 5 m deep and the maximum working depth is 2 0 m a motor driven piston type wavemaker is equipped at one end of the flume which is capable of generating regular and irregular waves a beach made with plastic horsehair is fixed at the other end of the wave flume to absorb incoming waves considering the dimension of the wave flume and the dimension of the selected ssp the geometric scaling ratio of ssp was set at 1 70 and the water depth was fixed to 1 40 m which corresponds to a water depth of about 100 m at full scale according to the froude scaling law 3 1 scaled ssp model a typical ssp fan et al 2017 consisting of one deck two pontoons four columns and four cross braces was selected as the objective ssp in this study the length width and depth of the ssp are 114 07 m 78 64 m and 38 6 m respectively and its displacement i e the total mass is 48206 8 tonnes an overview of the dimensions and properties of the platform are tabulated in table 1 the dimensions of the model after scaling are also shown in the table fig 3 b shows the scaled ssp model in the wave flume the model was made of steel and designed to be very stiff which could be considered as a rigid body with six degree of freedom 6 dof in the water it should be noted that the scaled model was placed in the middle of the wave flume to reduce the impact of reflected waves during the tests and the longer side of the platform was along the longitudinal direction of the flume in addition the incident angle of the wave was along the longitudinal direction of the flume i e the incident angle of the wave to the platform was 0 3 2 mooring system for the scaled model a set of mooring system consisting of four steel wires with flexible springs was adopted according to fan et al 2017 with the aim of avoiding the ssp model drifting away during the tests table 2 summarizes the properties of the mooring system in the prototype and the scaled model and fig 4 shows the schematic layout as shown in fig 4 a these mooring lines were positioned almost 90 apart each of them firstly passed through a v shape fixed pulley mounted at the anchor point and then connected to a spring a load cell and a tensioner that was fixed to a rigid steel frame as shown in fig 4 b specifically the flexible springs were utilized to represent the stiffness of the mooring lines the tensioners were installed to slightly adjust the initial length i e the initial force of the mooring lines when necessary the load cells were deployed to measure the forces in the mooring lines which will be presented in section 3 4 it is worth mentioning that ball bearings were utilized as axles inside the pulleys to minimize the influence of additional friction due to the introduction of ball bearings the additional friction sourced from pulleys could be effectively reduced therefore its influence was limited and could be ignored during the tests 3 3 rid and fhp as indicated in the introduction the primary objective of this paper is to experimentally investigate the control effectiveness of the rid and fhp systems in reducing the motions of the scaled ssp subjected to wave loads it is well known that compared to the other motions the heave motion is generally the most crucial and dominates the vibrations of a ssp since its natural period is the closest to the dominant period of the wave which will also be demonstrated in section 4 2 given this fact only the heave motion was of interest in the tests and a single rid and a single fhp were mounted to the scaled model respectively a rid device similar to the one experimentally investigated by the authors in ma et al 2021 was manufactured and table 3 lists the detailed specifications of the rid in particular a ball screw assembly made by the tbi motion model no sfv01210 was adopted to convert the linear motion to the rotations of two turning plates see fig 6 a and all components of the device were made of stainless steel to enhance corrosion resistance and durability the outer diameter length and stroke of the rid were 60 mm 660 mm and 250 mm respectively the mass of the turning plates was 0 013 kg while the physical and underwater masses of rid namely m a i r and m w in table 3 were 3 3 kg and 2 9 kg respectively it should be noted that the physical and underwater masses refer to the mass of rid in the air and water respectively and the underwater mass of rid is estimated by using a hydrostatic method i e m w m a i r ρ s ρ ρ s to make the rid effective one end of the rid was fixed to the ground of the wave flume and the other end was fixed to the platform through the ball hinges at the two ends of the rid see fig 5 as suggested in the authors previous study ma et al 2019 it should be noted that to avoid the possible eccentric load the rid was installed in the middle of the platform through a cross beam as shown in fig 5 in addition a waterproof load cell was attached to measure the resulted axial force fig 6 shows the on site photos of the rid and the scaled model equipped with the rid as for the fhp an aluminum alloy heave plate with a dimension of 0 4 m 0 4 m 0 01 m and a mass of 4 2 kg was manufactured similarly the underwater mass of the fhp is also calculated which is 2 7 kg figs 7 and 8 show the schematic drawing and on site photos respectively as shown the fhp system was placed under the platform and rigidly connected to the scaled model via a connecting rod similarly the fhp system was also installed centrally through the cross beam more detailed information about the fhp system can be found in table 3 3 4 instrumentations the instruments utilized in the wave flume tests are shown in fig 4 two wave probes were installed at the front and rear of the scaled model to measure wave elevation four load cells attached to the mooring lines were used to measure the tension forces of the mooring lines during the tests moreover another load cell was utilized to measure the axial force when the ssp was equipped with the rid as shown in fig 6 b these measured forces were collected and recorded by a data acquisition system furthermore an optical motion capture system namely ndi optotrak certus see fig 8 was utilized to measure the 6 dof motions of the scaled model this system was capable of precisely capturing the instantaneous positions of the ssp model by installing a planar rigid body with four infrared markers on the model see fig 8 all the measuring devices were calibrated before performing tests and the acquisition frequency was set to 100 hz 3 5 test programs in the present study the wave flume tests were divided into four parts 1 wave calibrations 2 free vibration tests 3 regular wave tests and 4 irregular wave tests in particular the wave calibration tests were performed to ensure the accuracy of the generated waves and the free vibration tests were applied to determine the natural periods of the scaled model in the regular wave tests a total of 14 regular waves were considered with the scaled frequencies ranging from 0 837 rad s to 7 530 rad s table 4 gives the amplitudes and frequencies periods of the full scale and scaled regular waves as shown the amplitude of the scaled regular waves was taken to be 60 mm for r1 r9 and decreased to 30 mm when the excitation frequency was larger than 4 602 rad s i e r10 r14 due to the power limitation of the wavemaker it should be noted that this frequency range namely 0 1 0 9 rad s at the full scale was chosen due to the following reasons 1 this paper focuses on the heave motion mitigation of ssp with different control systems to better demonstrate the control effectiveness the heave natural frequency of ssp should fall inside the selected frequency range of regular waves to ensure that resonance occurs in the heave direction for the chosen ssp prototype the natural heave frequency is 0 289 rad s which is inside the selected frequency range namely 0 1 0 9 rad s moreover as will be shown in the rao curves see fig 13 the heave raos are much larger at low frequencies compared to those at high frequencies therefore the heave motion of ssp at low frequencies deserves more attentions 2 this frequency range was also chosen based on the capacity of the wave flume for the adopted wave flume the highest working frequency is 2 hz corresponding to 1 5 rad s in the real situation beyond which the accuracy of the generated waves will be degraded in the irregular wave tests two irregular waves listed in table 5 were considered which correspond to the waves in the south china sea ir1 and the gulf of mexico ir2 respectively with a one year return period the irregular waves were simulated based on the joint north sea wave project jonswap spectrum defined as follows hasselmann et al 1973 3 s ω a h s 2 ω 5 ω 0 4 exp 1 25 ω ω 0 4 γ w exp ω ω 0 2 2 τ 2 ω 0 2 in which s ω is the power spectral density psd function of the jonswap spectrum h s is the significant wave height and ω 0 is the wave peak frequency which can be calculated based on t 0 tabulated in table 5 ω is the wave frequency and 4 a 0 0624 0 230 0 0336 γ w 0 185 1 9 γ w 1 where γ w is the peakedness factor with an average value of 3 3 chakrabarti 1987 τ is the shape parameter and it equals to 0 07 when ω ω 0 and 0 09 when ω ω 0 chakrabarti 1987 in order to meet the requirement of ergodicity the total duration of each irregular wave was 1260 s which corresponds to about 3 h at the full scale meanwhile each irregular wave was further divided into seven short sub waves with a duration of 180 s to reduce the annoying reflection effect of the wave flume in other words each irregular wave included seven 180 s sub waves that were all compatible with the given jonswap spectra it is worth mentioning that this method namely dividing the entire irregular wave into short sub waves is actually widely adopted in wave flume basin tests to ensure the accuracy of incident waves goda and suzuki 1976 in addition the water surface was waited to be calm before the subsequent test to avoid the influence from the prior test 4 experimental results and discussions 4 1 wave calibrations in practice certain discrepancies unavoidably exist between the theoretical and actually generated waves to evaluate the quality of the generated waves calibrations were performed for the regular and irregular waves notably the wave calibration tests were conducted in the absence of the ssp model 4 1 1 regular waves two regular waves i e r6 and r10 are taken out as examples to illustrate the quality of the generated regular waves fig 9 shows the theoretical and measured wave elevation time histories of the two regular waves it should be noted that the measured wave elevation time histories include two parts i e unstable and stable responses see fig 9 only the stable response would be utilized in the following analyses generally speaking despite some minor discrepancies very good repeatability was observed in the stable range between the theoretical and measured waves in terms of amplitudes and periods table 6 compares the frequencies and amplitudes of all the regular wave cases and the corresponding differences are also tabulated in the table it can be seen that most of the amplitude differences were less than 10 except r2 r5 and r10 and all the frequency differences were less than 0 56 which demonstrate the good quality of the regular waves in addition it is worth mentioning that the relatively large discrepancies in r2 r5 and r10 do not influence the response amplitude operators raos in section 4 3 since the measured amplitude rather than the theoretical amplitude of the regular waves will be utilized in the calculation 4 1 2 irregular waves fig 10 illustrates the wave elevation time histories of irregular waves ir1 1 and ir2 1 and table 7 compares the statistics of the theoretical and all the measured irregular waves notably the name i r i j i 1 2 and j 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 denotes the j t h sub wave of the i t h irregular wave to quantify the quality of the irregular waves the significant wave height h 1 3 and significant wave period t 1 3 of the measured irregular waves are calculated as follows 5 h 1 3 1 n 3 i 1 n 3 h i 6 t 1 3 1 n 3 i 1 n 3 t i in which n is the number of waves in the record h i is a series of wave height ranked from the highest to the lowest t i is the wave period corresponding to the i th wave height h i for the theoretical values they are tabulated in table 5 as discussed above table 7 summarizes the significant wave height and significant wave period of all the 7 sub waves of each irregular wave and the corresponding differences are also listed in the table it can be seen that the differences of the significant wave height and significant wave period for ir1 were less than 7 47 and 1 35 respectively as for ir2 the differences of the significant wave height and significant wave period were less than 3 39 and 3 89 respectively fig 11 shows the comparison between the theoretical equation 3 and measured wave spectra similarly good agreements are obtained as well the above comparisons demonstrate the good quality of the generated irregular waves 4 2 free vibration tests as calculated in table 2 when the ssp is in the original balanced position the initial force in each mooring line should be 5 83 n before the free vibration test the initial forces in the mooring lines were measured and table 8 lists the results as shown the measured initial forces were 5 52 5 42 5 08 and 5 61 n for lines 1 2 3 and 4 respectively which were slightly smaller than the theoretical value with a maximum difference of 12 84 these discrepancies might be caused by the facts that 1 the four mooring lines were not exactly symmetrical see fig 4 a and 2 the stiffness of the springs could not be exactly the same fig 4 b since the aim of the present study is to investigate the effectiveness of applying different control systems for ssp heave motion mitigation and the influence of these discrepancies does not affect the evaluation of the control effectiveness therefore no further action was made to adjust the initial mooring line forces the free vibration tests were then carried out in the calm water to determine the natural periods of the scaled ssp in the six directions see fig 3 b in particular the scaled model was applied a displacement angle at a specific dof and then released suddenly to let ssp oscillate freely the motion time histories of free oscillations were captured by ndi and the fast fourier transform fft technique was then utilized to identify the natural periods table 9 lists the natural periods identified from the free vibration tests as shown the full scale natural period of ssp in the heave direction is 21 79 s which is close to the ocean wave period band normally ranging from 5 s to 20 s pham and shin 2019 this fact indicates that the heave motion is the most crucial for this platform which is also the reason why the heave motion mitigation is of interest in this study moreover it is also found that all the six natural periods of ssp satisfy the requirements recommended by det norske veritas dnv as required in det norske veritas dnv 2011 the natural periods for a large moored floating platform in the surge sway and yaw directions are typically more than 100 s and the natural periods in the heave roll and pitch directions are usually above 20 s this fact demonstrates that the designed ssp is reasonable and can represent the common case of floating platforms in practices 4 3 regular wave tests regular wave tests were performed to evaluate the control effectiveness of the rid and fhp systems in reducing the heave motion of the ssp model under regular waves for comparison the bare ssp i e the ssp model without control was also tested fig 12 shows the results when the ssp model was subjected to regular waves r6 and r10 as shown both the rid and fhp systems were effective in reducing the heave motion of the ssp and the rid system was more effective in particular the peak heave motions of the bare ssp ssp rid and ssp fhp were respectively 22 49 mm 14 29 mm and 19 91 mm for r6 as for r10 the peak heave motion of the bare ssp was 11 33 mm which was reduced to 9 25 mm and 10 30 mm by introducing the rid and fhp systems respectively in other words compared to the bare ssp the reduction ratios for the rid and fhp systems were 36 5 and 11 5 respectively in case r6 and 18 4 and 9 1 respectively for case r10 for floating platforms the response amplitude operator rao is commonly used to evaluate the behaviors of platform which is defined as 7 r a o ω a ξ a in which a is the motion amplitude and ξ a is the wave amplitude at a specific wave incident frequency ω it should be noted that the amplitude of the wave was not stable at the beginning see fig 9 the rao values are determined when a and ξ a reached the steady range of the time histories as mentioned above fig 13 shows the heave rao curves of the scaled model without and with different control systems as shown in table 4 the excitation frequencies of the regular waves varied from 0 84 rad s to 7 53 rad s and as obtained in the free vibration tests the natural frequency of the bare ssp model in the heave direction was 2 41 rad s which is shown by the black dashed line in this figure it can be seen from fig 13 that for the bare ssp an obvious peak occurred at 2 09 rad s due to the fact that this excitation frequency was close to the natural vibration frequency of the ssp 2 41 rad s and resonance occurred in the pre peak region i e 0 84 rad s 2 09 rad s the rao values increased with the increment of the excitation frequency and tended to be unity at very low excitation frequencies in the post peak region i e 2 09 rad s 7 53 rad s the rao values decreased obviously especially in the range that is around the natural frequency of the ssp it should be noted that another wave with the excitation frequency very close to the natural frequency of the ssp was also tested 2 51 rad s in case r5 though this frequency was even closer to 2 41 rad s compared to case r4 with the excitation frequency of 2 09 rad s the peak rao value however did not occur in this case this is because as numerically demonstrated by the authors ma et al 2020a the rao curve varies sharply around the natural frequency of the ssp namely very significant change occurs within a very narrow excitation frequency range it is believed that even larger rao value could be obtained if the ssp was excited by a wave with the frequency between 2 09 rad s case r4 and 2 41 rad s and the excitation frequency is closer to 2 41 rad s the larger rao value would be obtained fig 13 also shows that for the ssp fhp system an obvious peak was also observed at 2 09 rad s which was caused by the resonance in the heave direction by introducing the fhp system the heave raos were slightly reduced when the wave excitation frequency was larger than 2 09 rad s it should be noted that as mentioned above the ocean wave period band normally ranges from 5 s to 20 s which corresponds to 2 63 rad s to 10 51 rad s for the scaled model which is displayed by the grey shaded area in the figure in other words the experimental results showed that the heave motion could be generally mitigated within the normal wave excitation range however it is also found that the heave raos of the ssp fhp system were slightly increased in the pre peak region this is because the fhp system increased the total mass and thus reduced the natural frequency of the scaled model which in turn amplified the raos in the pre peak region fig 13 also displays the rao curve of the scaled ssp with the rid system it should be noted that the data for cases r1 and r2 are not available because the motions of ssp exceeded the maximum stroke of rid i e 250 mm in table 3 under these two regular waves it is found that when rid was applied the heave motion could be obviously mitigated especially when the excitation frequency was relatively small smaller than 5 rad s as shown and the rid system was more effective compared to the fhp system the superior control effectiveness of rid was attributed to its superior energy dissipation capacity as discussed in section 2 4 4 irregular wave tests in this subsection the control effectiveness of the rid and fhp systems under irregular waves are investigated similarly the bare ssp model was also tested for comparison figs 14 and 15 show the example heave motion time histories of the scaled model without and with different control systems under irregular waves ir1 and ir2 respectively it should be noted that only the first and second sub waves of each irregular wave are taken out for illustration for the other sub waves similar trends were observed as shown in the figures both the rid and fhp systems could suppress the heave motion of the ssp and the rid system was more effective to quantitatively evaluate the control effectiveness besides the maximum heave motion the heave motion standard deviation σ is also calculated 8 σ z i μ 2 n in which z i is the recorded heave motion n is the number of data points μ is the mean of z i i 1 2 3 n tables 10 and 11 tabulate the results and the corresponding reduction ratios are also calculated and summarized in the tables in which ψ m a x is the reduction ratio for the maximum response and ψ σ corresponds to the reduction ratio for the standard deviation in addition to minimize the influence of the unstable waves see fig 10 the steady responses with duration of 180 s were extracted for the statistical results of each sub wave the statistical results of the ssp model without and with different control systems under ir1 are listed in table 10 it can be seen that both the maximum response and standard deviation under each sub wave could be suppressed by using the rid or fhp system and the rid system performed better under all the sub waves in particular the average value of the maximum responses of the bare ssp was 25 52 mm which was reduced to 20 10 mm and 23 07 mm by introducing the rid and fhp systems respectively the corresponding average reduction ratios were 21 24 and 9 60 respectively for the standard deviation the average reduction ratios of the rid and fhp systems were 27 07 and 10 69 respectively similar results are shown in table 11 which tabulates the results when the ssps were subjected to ir2 it can be seen that in average when fhp was installed the maximum response and standard deviation of the heave motion could be reduced by 14 45 and 11 74 respectively when rid was installed the corresponding results were 28 27 and 38 72 respectively the above results clearly demonstrate the control effectiveness of the rid system in reducing the heave motion of the ssp to further investigate the control effectiveness figs 16 and 17 present the heave motion psds of the scaled model without and with different control systems under irregular waves ir1 and ir2 respectively in general similar to the time domain results shown in figs 14 and 15 both the rid and fhp systems could reduce the heave motion psd of the ssp model and the control effectiveness of the rid system was more significant for the bare ssp model the psd curve showed a two peak characteristic the first peak occurred around 2 4 rad s which corresponds to the natural frequency of the scaled model in the heave direction as for the second peak it was caused by the dominant frequency of the wave see fig 11 and obviously higher than the first one this fact indicates that the heave motion of the ssp mainly came from the rigid body motion induced by the waves rather than the resonance of the ssp similar results were found in qiao and ou 2012 by introducing the control systems especially the rid system both the two peaks of psd curves were significantly suppressed which demonstrates the control effectiveness of the rid and fhp systems moreover it is also found that the first peak of psd curve moved leftward after installing the control systems this means that the natural frequency of the scaled model in the heave direction was reduced by both the rid and fhp systems however the working mechanisms of these two control systems are different specifically speaking the fhp system increased the effective mass and thus decreased the natural frequency of the scaled model as for the rid system it decreased the natural frequency of the ssp mainly due to its negative stiffness effect different from the positive stiffness provided by springs the negative stiffness produced by the rid could reduce the global stiffness and thus decrease the natural frequency of the ssp furthermore it is worth mentioning again that the physical mass of turning plates was only 0 013 kg in the tests this fact demonstrates that the rid system could achieve good control performance by using turning plates with very small physical mass which is consistent with the finding obtained in the previous analytical studies ma et al 2019 2020b 2020b fig 18 shows the measured force time histories of the rid system under irregular waves ir1 1 and ir2 1 it should be noted that only the results within the stable range 20 200 s are given and the force time histories of the fhp system are not given since they were not measured during the tests as shown the maximum control forces of the rid system under ir1 1 and ir2 1 were 116 7 n and 62 3 n respectively it is obvious that the maximum control force of the rid system under ir1 1 was larger than that under ir2 1 this is because the control force of rid is primarily governed by the nonlinear damping force proportional to the squared velocity see equation 1 and the ssp model under ir1 1 has larger heave motions and velocities which thus lead to the larger control forces 5 conclusions this paper presented the wave flume tests of a ssp subjected to the wave load with the aim of demonstrating the feasibility and control effectiveness of the rid and fhp systems in reducing the ssp heave motion a 1 70 scaled ssp model was manufactured and the vibration characteristics of the platform were determined firstly through free vibration tests then the bare ssp ssp rid and ssp fhp were tested under regular and irregular waves respectively based on the experimental results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the rid system is feasible and effective in reducing the heave motion of ssp by using turning plates with very small physical mass which provides an attractive alternative for the vibration control of offshore platforms 2 the conventional fhp system was effective in reducing the heave motion of ssp for the regular waves the heave raos in the normal wave excitation range was slightly reduced as for the irregular waves both the peak and standard deviation of the heave motion are mitigated and the maximum reduction ratios of 14 45 for the maximum response and 11 74 for the standard deviation were realized 3 compared to the fhp system the rid system was more effective in reducing the heave motion of the ssp for the regular waves the heave raos are obviously reduced especially when the excitation frequency was relatively small for the irregular waves both the peak and standard deviation of the heave motion were mitigated more effectively and the maximum reduction ratios of 28 27 for the maximum response and 38 72 for the standard deviation were achieved in the present study the effectiveness of using the rid system for the offshore platform vibration control has been demonstrated through wave flume tests in practice other parameters may influence the control effectiveness e g the possible friction in the mechanical structures the masses of the heave plate and rid the modelling of the irregular waves etc the influences of these parameters will be further investigated through numerical simulations and analytical derivations in future studies to establish guides for practical implementations of rid

20236,to alleviate the hypoxia in bottom seawater an array of innovative wave driven water exchange wdwe devices with heaving buoys was proposed to transport superficial oxygen rich water to deep hypoxic zones the hydrodynamic characteristics of the devices arranged in an in line square configuration were experimentally investigated under regular and irregular waves it is found that the characteristic heave amplitudes and flow rates increase with increasing wave height and wave period the average heave amplitudes and flow rates in regular waves are larger than the significant heave amplitudes and flow rates in irregular waves the relative heave amplitudes decrease but the non dimensional outlet flow rates increase with increasing wave steepness generally the characteristic heave amplitudes and flow rates of the upstream device are higher than those of the downstream device in regular and irregular waves the water intake depth has a negative effect on the characteristic heave amplitudes and flow rates finally the variation in the oxygen transfer coefficients was analyzed the results show that the oxygen transfer coefficients under the device effect are a few orders of magnitude larger than those without the device effect this indicates that the array of wdwe devices can effectively enhance do concentration in bottom waters keywords hypoxia wdwe device heave

2008 the number of dead zones caused by hypoxia in global oceans had grown rapidly to more than 400 diaz and rosenberg 2008 conley et al 2011 schmidtko et al 2017 quantitatively analyzed the global oceanic oxygen levels based on oxygen data collected over the last five decades and pointed out that the do concentrations exhibited a statistically pronounced decline in numerous oceanic regions

2017 schmidtko et al 2017 one of the largest seasonal hypoxic areas in the world is the northern gulf of mexico where approximately 2000 km2 was found to be suffering from hypoxia in 2010 rabalais et

l at the bottom or 100 m for water depths 100 m in the autumn of 2011 chen et al 2020 to the best of our knowledge there are two primary causes of the formation and development of hypoxia one is seawater eutrophication triggered by pollutants which exacerbates the decomposition of organic matter in bottom water the other is the reduction of vertical exchange action between the oxygen rich surface water and bottom water with low oxygen content mainly due to seawater stratification driven by global warming caddy 1993 diaz 2001 taking into consideration the above factors koweek et al 2020 presented three options to solve or alleviate hypoxia problems aeration sediment nutrient binding and vertical mixing capacity enhancement regarding the vertical water mixing technique its original intention was to pump nutrient rich water from the ocean bottom to the seawater surface to increase fishery production isaacs et al 1976 liu and jin 1995 maruyama et al 2004 kenyon 2007 likewise improving the vertical mixing performance in the water column can be used to increase the do concentration in bottom water koweek et al 2020 lawson and anderson 2007 attempted to quantitatively describe the natural mixing processes and water column properties of a shallow eutrophic lake in southern california and analyzed the influence of axial flow pump operation on do concentration in the water column stigebrandt et al 2015 constructed a pump system to pump oxygen saturated and low salinity surface water into deep water a 2 5 year long environmental engineering experiment in the by fjord located at the western coast of sweden verified that the pump system can drastically change the hypoxic environment of deep water more recently considerable attention has been devoted to the utilization of ocean wave energy many different wave energy converter wec concepts have been proposed to extract clean energy from wave motion including point absorber oscillating water column overtopping and wave activated bodies mustapa et al 2017 as one of the most representative point absorber wecs the heaving buoy has the advantages of relatively high energy conversion efficiency and strong adaptability under various wave conditions a large amount of studies have been reported on the hydrodynamic characteristics of a single heaving buoy falcão et al 2012 jahangir et al 2018 zang et al 2018 shi et al 2019 these studies have helped extend the knowledge regarding its dynamic behavior and power absorption however the energy capture capability for a single heaving buoy is relatively small and an array of buoys was proposed to enhance the energy capture capability garnaud and mei 2009 theoretically evaluated the hydrodynamics and power extraction efficiency of a compact array of small buoys erselcan and kükner 2017 reported that the energy generated by each wec in arrays was less than that generated by a single wec borgarino et al 2012 assessed the interactions between arrays of point absorber wecs with relatively large separating distances and they pointed out that the decrease in the energy absorption was partially compensated by the diffracted and radiated waves in the array numerical simulations were carried out by kara 2016 to investigate the energy absorption in both sway and heave modes the results showed that the wave interactions were stronger at any wave directions and separating distances if the bodies in arrays were close de andrés et al 2014 investigated the effect of array arrangement separating distance number of wecs and wave direction on wave energy array behavior it was found that the square configurations and the triangular configurations were optimum for unidirectional wave climates and multidirectional wave climates respectively in addition the wave energy can be applied to enhance vertical water exchange and alleviate the hypoxia in bottom water margheritini and claeson 2011 introduced the wave energized baltic aeration pump for collecting overtopping water to oxygenate bottom seawater antonini et al 2012 2015 2016 performed both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations on a wave driven oxyflux device to investigate its dynamic responses and pumping capacity under different wave conditions yin et al 2020 developed a wave driven device with a single buoy to transport surface water to deep zones and the hydrodynamic behavior and oxygen transfer performance were experimentally and numerically studied with various wave parameters xiao et al 2018 proposed a tidal pump to alleviate the hypoxic waters and analyzed the effects of tidal current speed immersed length and pump geometry on the downwelling flow rate theoretically and experimentally inspired by the arrays of point absorber wecs aforementioned this study presents an array of wave driven water exchange wdwe devices arranged in an in line square configuration as an extension of the device with a single buoy proposed by yin et al 2020 the objective of this study is to assess the different hydrodynamic performance of the upstream device and downstream device and qualitatively describe the effect of wdwe devices on the changes of do concentration in order to achieve these goals a series of laboratory experiments were carried out to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics in both regular and irregular waves the heaving response of buoys and the flow process at the outlet tube were measured for four different water intake depths the heave amplitudes and outlet flow rates were subsequently calculated the effects of the incident wave parameters on the heave amplitude and outlet flow rate were analyzed in addition the average heave amplitudes and outlet flow rates in regular waves were compared with the significant heave amplitudes and flow rates in irregular waves finally the effect of the wdwe devices on the oxygen transfer coefficient variations was also studied in regular and irregular waves 2 conceptual design 2 1 structure sketch the proposed wdwe devices with heaving buoys are inspired by the arrays of point absorber wecs and are an extension of the device with a single buoy presented by yin et al 2020 as shown in fig 1 a the array of wdwe devices consists of four independent devices therefore it theoretically has the advantage of higher wave energy capture performance compared with a single buoy device the structure of a single wdwe device presented in detail in fig 1 b can be divided into three parts heaving components water exchange components and supporting components the heaving components include a hollow cylindrical buoy to absorb incident wave energy which is connected to two pins a piston to suck and extrude water and a connecting rod to connect the buoy and the piston the main part of the water exchange components comprises a hydraulic cylinder to store the oxygen rich water the water inlet and outlet tubes are linked to the hydraulic cylinder by a one way inlet valve and outlet valve respectively a venthole is opened at the top of the hydraulic cylinder to ensure air exchange between the area above the piston and the outside atmosphere for minimizing the air resistance at the top of the piston the supporting components are a combination of a square gravity base to maintain stability under the action of wave two cylindrical slide bars to control the vertical motion of the heaving components through the two pins and a square supporting frame to fix the hydraulic cylinder with the help of the two cylindrical slide bars 2 2 heave motion and operation principle the heave motion of the buoy can be expressed by newton s second law the governing equation is as follows 1 m z t c b z t k z t f t where m is the total mass of the system which includes the net mass of the heaving components and the additional mass of the water body z t z t and z t denote the instantaneous acceleration velocity and vertical displacement of the heaving components respectively c b is the equivalent damping coefficient of the system which is a combination of the structural damping coefficient induced by friction and the external damping coefficient due to water suction and extrusion k is the hydrostatic restoring force coefficient expressed as k ρgs where s is the cross sectional area of the buoy ρ is the fluid density and g is the acceleration of gravity f t is the wave excitation force on the heaving components which is directly related to the wave conditions the operation principle of the device is simple with the increase of wave surface elevation the heaving components move from the low to the high position along the slide bars under the combined effects of buoyancy and wave excitation force and the internal pressure between the pistons and the bottom of the hydraulic cylinders decreases the surface oxygen rich water is sucked into the hydraulic cylinders through the water inlet tubes and one way inlet valves with the decrease of wave surface elevation the heaving components move from the high position back to the low position owing mainly to the gravity effect and the internal pressure between the pistons and the bottom of the hydraulic cylinders increases as a result the oxygen rich water stored in the hydraulic cylinders is extruded in the deep hypoxic zone through the water outlet tubes and the one way outlet valves and the do concentration in the deep hypoxic zone increases to alleviate the hypoxia problem note that the devices were driven by waves without the consumption of fossil fuels and electricity hence these are both environment friendly and have higher economic efficiency in theory 3 experimental investigation 3 1 experimental setup the present study was limited to a unidirectional wave field in the wave flume and an in line square configuration was adopted as shown in fig 2 a consistent with the optimum configuration reported by de andrés et al 2014 the two upstream buoys were labelled as 1 and 2 respectively and the two downstream buoys were labelled as 3 and 4 note that the hydrodynamic characteristics of wec array were closely related to the separating distance de andrés et al 2014 pointed out that a high conversion efficiency can be achieved when the distance between the wecs was equal to the half of wave length however due to the size limitation of the wave flume the axis distance between two buoys in each row or each column was relatively small as a constant value of 0 32 m in this study and the ratio of separating distance and buoy diameter was 1 45 which was close to the values of 1 30 reported by kara 2016 and 1 50 reported by liu et al 2017 fig 2 b provides a detailed description of the size of each part of a single physical wdwe device model the buoy was a hollow cylinder made of a transparent acrylic plate of 10 mm thickness and its diameter d b and height h b were 0 22 m and 0 08 m respectively the overall average density ρ b of the heaving components was 385 kg m3 the diameter and height of the hydraulic cylinder were 0 05 m and 0 45 m respectively the length of the slide bar was 0 90 m and the distance between the gravity base bottom and the supporting frame was 0 27 m the diameter of the water inlet and outlet tubes was 0 012 m a decay test was conducted to measure the natural period of the heaving buoy with a value of 2 5 s in still water and the corresponding natural frequency was 2 51 rad s a series of experiments were conducted in a wave flume at the hydrodynamic laboratory of ocean university of china fig 3 shows a schematic profile of the wave flume the length depth and width of the wave flume were 25 0 m 1 2 m and 1 0 m respectively a piston type wave paddle was installed at one end of the flume to generate the desired regular and irregular waves a sponge type wave absorber was fixed at the other end to absorb waves and minimize the wave reflection a cartesian coordinate system was set with the positive x axis along the incident wave propagation direction and the positive z axis along the upward direction x 0 at the balanced position of the wave paddle and z 0 at the still water surface the locations of the wdwe devices and their corresponding x coordinates are also presented in fig 3 the central axes of the upstream and downstream buoys were positioned at x 12 m and x 12 32 m respectively buoys 1 and 2 as well as buoys 3 and 4 were arranged symmetrically on the two sides of the longitudinal centerline of the flume the heave motion and water exchange performance of the two upstream buoys and two downstream buoys were almost identical to each other hence buoys 1 and 3 were selected to represent the upstream and downstream buoys respectively throughout the experiments the exit of each water outlet tube was fixed at 0 02 m from the flume bottom the water intake depth h in i e the vertical distance between the intake of the water inlet tube and the still water surface was varied to consider its effect on the hydrodynamic characteristics two displacement sensors with an accuracy of 0 0001 m were used to measure the vertical displacement histories of buoys 1 and 3 the two ends of the displacement sensors were fixed on the top portions of the heaving components and a transverse structure at the top of wave flume two flowmeters were attached to the outlet tubes of buoys 1 and 3 to measure the flow rate four wave gauges with a sampling frequency of 50 hz were installed to measure the wave height histories one was placed behind the array of wdwe devices to measure the wave transmission and the other three wave gauges were placed in front of the devices to identify the incident and reflected waves the do concentration measurements were performed using three jpb 607a do probes dops with an accuracy of 0 10 mg l after calibration with the winkler technique yakushev et al 2012 as shown in fig 3 dop 1 was placed in the middle of the devices and the wave paddle and dop 2 and dop 3 were placed within the vicinity of the intake of the water inlet tube and the exit of the water outlet tube respectively during the experiments the range of water temperature was measured from 20 1 c to 20 3 c and the effect of such small temperature changes on the do concentration can be neglected 3 2 experimental conditions in this study the experiments were classified into two groups one group explored the hydrodynamic characteristics including the heave amplitudes and the outlet flow rates of the array of wdwe devices in regular and irregular waves the other group sought to quantify the changes in the do concentration of water under the action of the wdwe devices table 1 lists the 200 experimental scenarios for exploring the hydrodynamic characteristics incident regular waves with heights h between 0 12 m and 0 20 m with an interval of 0 02 m and periods t between 1 5 s and 2 7 s with an interval of 0 3 s were generated with respect to irregular waves the jonswap spectrum goda 2000 was adopted to generate irregular waves because of its ability to describe sea conditions realistically the combination of five significant wave heights h s and five different spectral peak periods t p yielded a total of 25 unique wave conditions in addition the water intake depth h in was varied from 0 13 m to 0 25 m with an interval of 0 04 m table 2 lists the experimental scenarios for do concentration measurement along with the effects of the array of wdwe devices in these scenarios the water intake depth h in of 0 17 m remained constant to simplify the research for regular waves the wave heights h and wave periods t ranged from 0 12 m to 0 18 m with an interval of 0 02 m and 2 1 s to 2 7 s with an interval of 0 3 s respectively for irregular waves four significant wave heights h s of 0 12 m 0 14 m 0 16 m and 0 18 m and three spectral peak periods t p of 1 71 s 2 05 s and 2 56 s are considered a total of 24 experimental tests were performed to examine the do concentration note that due to the excessive time required for the recovery of do concentration without the wdwe device effect the do concentration measurement was not conducted in the absence of the wdwe in this study alternatively the empirical equations were applied to investigate the effect of waves on oxygen transfer performance a detailed description of the empirical equations can be found in section 4 3 3 3 experimental procedures prior to the experiments for hydrodynamic characteristic investigation the array of wdwe devices and the aforementioned measuring instruments were fixed at the desired locations the intake of the water inlet tubes and the exit of the water outlet tubes must be fixed at the surface oxygen rich zone and deep hypoxic zone respectively the wave flume was filled with freshwater to a still water depth h of 0 5 m and then the wave paddle began generating the desired regular and irregular waves the time histories of the wave surface elevation heave amplitude and outlet flow rate were measured by the wave gauges displacement sensors and flowmeters respectively with respect to the experiments for do concentration measurements an additional operating procedure was required to consume the do concentration in the water therefore the appropriate amount of sodium sulfite na2so3 powder with the catalyst of cobalt chloride cocl2 was thrown uniformly into the whole flume before wave generation bekassy molnar et al 1997 because the densities of na2so3 and cocl2 were higher than that of water their concentration in deep water was relatively higher than in surface water the do near the bottom of the flume was greatly consumed and a hypoxic environment was induced in addition the do concentration of surface water was relatively higher owing to lower na2so3 and cocl2 concentrations and the facilitation of oxygen transfer from the atmosphere as a result the vertical stratification of do concentration was artificially created in the water flume it should be noted that na2so3 and cocl2 must stand in the wave flume for more than 30 min before wave generation to ensure the complete reaction of do and na2so3 then the wave paddle started to generate the desired waves and the do concentrations were measured by the dops 3 4 data processing the evaluation of the hydrodynamic responses plays a significant role in the design and operation of wecs in this study the characteristic heave amplitudes i e the average heave amplitude z a in regular waves and the significant heave amplitude z s in irregular waves are used to quantify the heave response performance of buoys the former is defined as the average value of the heave range of the buoy in each motion period obtained by z a 1 n i 1 n z max i z min i where n is the number of buoy motion periods and is equal to the number of wave periods z max i and z min i are the highest and lowest locations of the buoy in the ith motion period respectively the latter is defined as the average value of the highest one third of the measured heave amplitudes of the buoy in irregular waves similarly the characteristic outlet flow rates of the wdwe devices i e the average outlet flow rate q a in regular waves and the significant outlet flow rate q s in irregular waves are used to quantify water exchange performance of devices the average outlet flow rate is defined as the average value of the instantaneous outlet flow rate over the entire test period and the significant outlet flow rate is defined as the average value of the highest one third of the instantaneous outlet flow rate over the entire test period note that each of test was repeated three times to assure the consistency of experimental measurements the deviation for three repeated tests was calculated by e i x i x x where x i is the variable i e the characteristic heave amplitude or the characteristic outlet flow rate in ith test for one case and i 1 2 3 x is the average value of three repeated tests defined as x x 1 x 2 x 3 3 it is found that e 1 e 2 and e 3 values are all less than 8 which indicates the acceptable accuracy of experimental measurement in addition the average values of three repeated tests were used to represent the characteristic heave amplitudes and outlet flow rates 4 results and discussion 4 1 heave motion of buoys fig 4 presents the time series of heave displacements z of buoys 1 and 3 for h in 0 21 m h 0 12 m and t 1 5 s under regular waves the wave surface elevation η at x 12 m without the device effect is also shown in fig 4 for reference note that the wave surface elevation η at x 12 m cannot be measured directly using the wave gauges because its position overlaps with that of the devices therefore it is calculated using the linear wave propagation theory based on the wave surface elevations recorded by wg3 at x 10 m it is found that the range of heave motions of the two buoys is obviously less than the incident wave height the maximum heave displacements of buoy 1 are slightly larger than those of buoy 3 the heave periods of buoys 1 and 3 are the same as the wave period but there is a relatively obvious phase difference approximately π 2 between the heave motion of buoys and the wave surface elevation furthermore because the position of buoy 3 is downstream of the wave flume relative to buoy 1 as shown in fig 2 a a small phase difference approximately 0 27π between the heave motions of buoys 1 and 3 is also observed irregular waves are known to be more accurate in representing real ocean wave conditions hence understanding the hydrodynamic responses of the devices under irregular waves is of scientific significance and engineering value in this study the jonswap spectrum goda 2000 is selected to generate irregular waves the spectrum density s f is denoted as follows 2 s f β j h s 2 t p 4 f 5 exp 1 25 t p f 4 γ exp t p f 1 2 2 σ 2 where f is the wave frequency and h s is the significant wave height which can be defined as the average value of the highest one third of the measured wave heights γ is the peak lifting factor which is typically selected as 3 3 the coefficient β j can be expressed as follows 3 β j 0 06238 1 094 0 01915 ln γ 0 230 0336 γ 0 185 1 9 γ 1 the spectral peak period t p can be expressed as follows 4 t p t 1 3 1 0 132 γ 0 2 0 559 σ is the peak shape parameter the value of which is defined as 5 σ 0 07 f f p 0 09 f f p where f p is the peak frequency which is equal to the inverse of t p the fast fourier transform method is adopted to obtain the energy density spectrum of irregular wave trains measured in the experiments fig 5 shows a comparison of the measured and theoretical wave spectrum of the irregular wave train without the device effect for h s 0 16 m and t p 2 05 s it is observed that the wave spectrum measured in the experiment is close to the theoretical values both the measured peak frequency and the corresponding s f value are in good agreement with the theoretical wave spectrum fig 6 shows the time series of wave surface elevation η and experimental heave displacements z of buoys 1 and 3 for h in 0 25 m h s 0 14 m and t p 1 71 s under irregular waves the heave motions of the two buoys in irregular waves for wide range between t 40 s 70 s and 80 s 100 s exhibit close similarities with those in regular waves the range of heave motions is obviously less than the incident wave height and a phase difference can be found between the motions of the buoys and the wave surface elevation when the time series is in the range of 70 s 80 s buoys 1 and 3 are almost in the quiescent state which is similar to the results obtained by zang et al 2018 the reason for this phenomenon is that the incident wave heights in this time period are relatively small and the wave excitation force is not sufficiently large to overcome the damping force induced by friction and water suction and extrusion fig 7 shows the variation of the average heave amplitude z a with respect to the incident wave height h for regular waves each inset of fig 7 corresponds to different water intake depths h in it is observed that both the z a values of buoy 1 and 3 increase with the increase of wave height although there are some intersections between the z a curves of buoy 1 and 3 in each inset of fig 7 the z a values of buoy 3 are generally lower than those of buoy 1 one explanation for this is that the presence of the upstream buoy 1 reduces the wave forces on the downstream buoy 3 it is worth noting that the z a of buoy 3 exceeds those of buoy 1 for t 1 5 s in fig 7 d and a similar conclusion was reported by liu et al 2017 that the heave amplitude of the front buoy was less than that of the rear buoy for a compact buoy array type wec the accurate reason is unclear and this may be due to the complex interactions between the incident waves reflected waves radiated waves and the array of wdwe devices in addition fig 7 a and b show that the z a values of buoys 1 and 3 range from 1 68 cm to 5 58 cm for h in 0 13 m and h in 0 17 m fig 7 c and d show that the z a values of buoys 1 and 3 range from 1 11 cm to 5 12 cm for h in 0 21 m and h in 0 25 m these indicate that the water intake depth plays a negative role in the heave motions of both the upstream and downstream buoys fig 8 shows the variation of the significant heave amplitude z s with significant wave height h s for irregular waves the results indicate that the relationship between the significant heave amplitude and significant wave height in irregular waves generally has the same trend as that in regular waves i e the z s values increase with increasing h s the increasing rate of z s is closely associated with h in with the increase of h s from 0 14 m to 0 22 m for h in 0 13 m and t p 1 28 s z s increases significantly from 0 94 cm to 2 07 cm for buoy 1 and from 0 69 cm to 1 94 cm for buoy 3 in fig 8 a whereas for h in 0 25 m and t p 1 28 s as shown in fig 8 d the increase of h s causes the z s of buoys 1 and 3 to increase slightly from 0 53 cm to 1 32 cm and 0 47 cm to 1 29 cm respectively moreover it can be clearly seen that z s of buoy 3 is smaller than that of buoy 1 for irregular waves for instance the mean value of z s for buoy 1 in fig 8 a is 2 08 cm which is larger than 1 89 cm for buoy 3 figs 9 and 10 show the characteristic heave amplitude versus wave period for regular and irregular waves respectively similarly four different water intake depths h in 0 13 m 0 17 m 0 21 m and 0 25 m are considered both z a and z s increase with increasing wave period with the exception of some outliers of buoy 3 for t p 1 71 s in fig 10 a in fig 9 buoys 1 and 3 have larger average heave amplitudes ranging from 1 11 cm to 5 93 cm while for irregular waves in fig 10 the significant heave amplitudes z s are within the range of 0 47 cm 3 37 cm in the scenarios with h in 0 21 m and h h s 0 14 m the z a values of buoys 1 and 3 for regular waves of t 2 1 s in fig 9 c are 2 42 cm and 2 08 cm respectively the z s values of buoys 1 and 3 for irregular waves of t p 2 05 s in fig 10 c are 1 66 cm and 1 40 cm respectively therefore the z a in regular waves is larger than the z s in irregular waves for similar values of wave height and period for the four water intake depths in our experiments the smallest heave amplitudes occur when h in 0 25 m is tested for both regular and irregular waves z a under regular waves and z s under irregular waves for h in 0 25 m are within the range of 1 11 cm 4 72 cm and 0 47 cm 2 79 cm respectively the largest heave amplitudes occur when h in 0 13 m and the characteristic heave amplitudes for this water intake depth range from 1 68 cm to 5 63 cm and 0 69 cm 3 37 cm under regular and irregular waves respectively to further explore the intrinsic relationship between the wave parameters and the heave motion of the buoys the relationships between two non dimensional parameters i e the relative heave amplitude and wave steepness are discussed for regular waves the relative heave amplitude is the ratio of the average heave amplitude z a to the wave height h the wave steepness λ is defined as follows 6 λ h l where l is the wavelength that can be calculated using the linear dispersion relationship l g t 2 2 π tanh k 0 d where k 0 is the wave number and k 0 2π l for irregular waves the relative heave amplitude is the ratio of the significant heave amplitude z s to the significant wave height h s the significant wave steepness λ s can be estimated as follows det norske veritas 2010 7 λ s k p h s 2 π where k p is wave number corresponding to the spectral peak period t p fig 11 shows the relationship between z a h and λ for different water intake depths h in for reference two auxiliary lines are shown in each inset of fig 11 to fit the data points using the power function z a h αλ β the fitted z a h values decrease with increasing λ for every water intake depth scenario however the decreasing rate is also closely associated with h in for the smallest h in 0 13 m scenario in fig 11 a the z a h values of buoy 1 and 3 decrease from 0 416 to 0 129 and 0 406 to 0 127 respectively with increasing λ for the largest h in 0 25 m scenario in fig 11 d the z a h values of buoy 1 and 3 decrease from 0 250 to 0 093 and from 0 257 to 0 123 respectively with increasing λ because the presence of the upstream buoy 1 reduces the wave forces acting on the downstream buoy 3 the fitted z a h values of buoy 1 are higher than those of buoy 3 except for the largest water intake depth as shown in fig 11 d a possible reason for this observation is that a larger water intake depth corresponding to a higher damping force of water suction inhibits the heave motion of buoy 1 this may weaken the shelter effect of upstream buoy 1 on the downstream buoy 3 hence the z a h values of buoy 3 are higher than those of buoy 1 the correlation coefficients r 2 between z a h and λ of buoy 1 and 3 in fig 11 a and b are higher than those in fig 11 c and d indicating that the data have a marginally larger scatter for a larger water intake depth the correlation coefficient r 2 of buoy 3 is generally lower than that of buoy 1 illustrating that buoy 3 is more susceptible to complex interactions between the incident wave the wave reflected from the devices and the radiated waves produced by buoy motion fig 12 shows the relationship between z s h s and λ s for different water intake depths h in two auxiliary lines are drawn in each inset to fit the data points using the power function z s h s αλ s β a comparison of the data plots for buoys 1 and 3 in each inset of fig 12 reveals that the z s h s values of the upstream buoy are larger than those of the downstream buoy similar to the results for regular waves in fig 11 the fitted z s h s values decrease with increasing λ s for every water intake depth scenario the comparison of z a h in regular waves and z s h s in irregular waves shows that the results of z a h in regular waves are generally larger than z s h s in irregular waves for similar values of λ and λ s for instance the z a h values of buoy 1 in regular waves for h in 0 21 m range from 0 118 to 0 312 in fig 11 c which are generally higher than the z s h s values ranging from 0 067 to 0 129 in fig 12 c another trend is that the deviation between the data points and the auxiliary lines in fig 12 is more significant than that in fig 11 indicating that the results for irregular waves appear more scattered than those for regular waves this is due mainly to the more complex interactions between the incident wave reflected wave and radiated wave under irregular waves 4 2 outlet flow rate fig 13 shows the variation of the average outlet flow rate q a with respect to the incident wave height h for regular waves each inset of fig 13 corresponds to different water intake depths h in owing to the complexity of the interactions between waves and the devices the nonlinearity between the average outlet flow rate and incident wave height is obvious and some overlaps and intersections between the q a curves of buoy 1 and 3 can also be observed however in general both the average outlet flow rates of buoy 1 and 3 increase with the increase of wave height as h increases from 0 12 m to 0 20 m the q a values for h in 0 13 m in fig 13 a increase from 6 18 ml s to 11 51 ml s in fig 13 a b and c the q a values of buoy 1 are generally larger than those of buoy 3 for instance the average q a value of buoy 1 is 9 72 ml s in fig 13 a while that of buoy 3 is 8 92 ml s however the average q a value of buoy 1 is less than that of buoy 3 in fig 13 d these results are consistent with the relationship between z a and h as shown in fig 7 fig 14 shows the variation of the significant outlet flow rate q s with respect to the significant wave height h s for irregular waves the significant outlet flow rate versus significant wave height in irregular waves generally has the same trend as that in regular waves q s increases as h s increases and the q s values of buoy 1 are generally larger than those of buoy 3 among the four different water intake depths in fig 14 the largest q s occurs when h in 0 13 m is tested the significant outlet flow rates of buoy 1 and 3 for this water intake depth range from q s 3 00 ml s to 8 96 ml s for the largest h in 0 25 m the significant outlet flow rates of buoy 1 and 3 are relatively small ranging from q s 2 04 ml s to 6 74 ml s to further investigate the water transport performance of the array of wdwe devices under different wave conditions the relationship between the non dimensional outlet flow rate and wave steepness is analyzed fig 15 shows the variation of the non dimensional outlet flow rate q a d b 2 g t with respect to wave steepness λ in regular waves the power function q a d b 2 g t α λ β is used to fit the scattered data points the results show a general trend of the non dimensional outlet flow rate increasing monotonically with increasing wave steepness fig 15 a b and c show that the q a d b 2 g t values of buoy 1 are generally larger than those of buoy 3 and the largest difference between q a d b 2 g t values of buoy 1 and buoy 3 occurs for the smallest h in 0 13 m however the fitted q a d b 2 g t values of buoy 3 are higher than those of buoy 1 for the largest h in 0 25 m scenario in fig 15 d the two fitted curves in each inset show that the difference between the non dimensional outlet flow rates of buoy 1 and buoy 3 increases as the wave steepness increases this illustrates that the difference between the outlet flow rates of buoy 1 and buoy 3 becomes increasingly obvious for larger steepness fig 16 shows the relationship between q s d b 2 g t p and λ s for different water intake depths h in the scattered data points are also fitted by the power function q s d b 2 g t p α λ s β the results show that the fitted q s d b 2 g t p values increase with increasing λ s for irregular waves this trend is similar to the results in regular waves shown in fig 15 however the q s d b 2 g t p values in irregular waves are generally less than q a d b 2 g t values in regular waves for instance the q s d b 2 g t p values of buoy 1 in irregular waves for h in 0 25 m range from 2 63 10 6 to 9 64 10 6 in fig 16 d whereas the q a d b 2 g t values range between 4 70 10 6 to 1 37 10 5 in fig 15 d because the nonlinearity is relatively significant between q a and h in regular waves as shown in fig 13 the correlation coefficients r 2 in fig 15 are generally less than those in fig 16 as an extension of the device with a single buoy presented by yin et al 2020 the water exchange performance of the array of wdwe devices could be very different from the single device fig 17 shows a preliminary comparison of the non dimensional outlet flow rate q a d b 2 g t in regular waves between the array of devices and the single device used in yin et al 2020 note that h in in yin et al 2020 was recalculated as the vertical distance between the intake of the water inlet tube and the still water surface to make it consistent with the definition of h in in this study and the cases with h in 0 15 m presented by yin et al 2020 were selected for the comparison because this water intake depth was close to h in 0 13 m in this study it is found that the fitted q a d b 2 g t values of buoy 1 buoy 3 and the single device increase with increasing λ basically the fitted q a d b 2 g t values of buoy 1 and buoy 3 are markedly lower than those of the single device this indicates that the hydrodynamic interaction of the array of devices has negative effect on the water exchange performance which is in agreement with the conclusion drawn by erselcan and kükner 2017 as a result the total outlet flow rate of the array of wdwe devices is unable to achieve 4 times that of a single device in addition the data points of q a d b 2 g t reported by yin et al 2020 are relatively scattered a possible reason is that q a d b 2 g t and λ do not take into account the effect of the density and height of buoy however the density and height of buoy are 295 kg m3 and 0 12 m respectively in yin et al 2020 which are different from 385 kg m3 and 0 08 m in the present study for irregular waves the significant wave steepness under irregular waves used in this study and yin et al 2020 ranges respectively from 0 026 to 0 097 and 0 009 to 0 033 the λ s difference is too large to compare their water exchange performance directly therefore the comparison of the water exchange performance for irregular waves is not included in this study 4 3 do concentration fig 18 shows the time series of do concentrations measured by three dops for both regular and irregular waves for comparison the incident wave height h of 0 12 m in regular waves is equal to the significant wave height h s in irregular waves and the regular wave period t 2 7 s approaches the spectral peak period t p 2 56 s in irregular waves the results show that the do concentrations measured by dop 1 and dop 3 are very small at the initial time however the do concentration measured by dop 2 is relatively high this indicates the obvious vertical stratification of the do concentration at the initial time for regular waves as shown in fig 18 a the do concentration measured by dop 3 near the exit of the water outlet tube increases linearly between 0 s and 70 s owing to the intermittent release of oxygen rich water from the hydraulic cylinders then it remains within the range of 3 1 mg l to 3 4 mg l do concentration measured by dop 2 abruptly increases within a short period of time and reaches the maximum value because dop 2 is located near the wave surface then the released water from the exit of the water outlet tube squeezes the surrounding hypoxic water to the dop 2 location thus the do concentration of dop 2 is slightly reduced and remains within the range of 3 0 mg l to 3 2 mg l between 20 s and 85 s as a result the phenomenon that the do concentration of dop 2 is lower than that of dop 3 is observed between 20 s and 100 s in fig 18 a however due to the good oxygen transfer performance caused by the high outlet flow rate and uniform distribution of do concentrations in water depth direction for regular waves the do concentration of dop 2 increases and then maintains at a high level for t 100 s and it is no longer less than that of dop 3 for t 300 s because dop 1 is relatively far from the exit of the water outlet tube the fluctuation of do concentration is observed between 30 s and 300 s and the do concentration increases slowly and smoothly between 300 s and 600 s as shown in fig 18 b the time series of do concentrations measured by dops 1 and 3 for irregular waves show a similar trend as those for regular waves due to the released oxygen rich water from the outlet tube the do concentration of dop 3 first increases rapidly and then maintains a relatively high value the do concentration of dop 1 first presents a pattern of fluctuation before 600 s and then increases obviously between 600 s and 800 s for dop 2 the do concentration first increases rapidly and then decreases slightly however because of the small outlet flow rate and inferior water exchange performance for irregular waves the increase of do concentration of dop 2 is not observed in fig 18 b more specifically due to the combined effects of the vertical exchange between bottom hypoxic water and surface oxygen rich water and the oxygen transfer from the atmosphere to water through wave surface the do concentration of dop 2 varies little for t 100 s and it is slightly lower than that of dop 1 after 760 s in summary fig 18 shows that the do concentration measured by dop 3 first increases rapidly and then maintains a high value along the time series for both regular and irregular waves in addition the do concentrations measured by dop 1 are smaller than those measured by dop 3 in the range of t 600 s for regular waves and t 800 s for irregular waves this indicates that the proposed array of wdwe devices can improve do concentration near the outlet tube exit in a short duration to qualitatively describe the changes in do concentration of the water under the action of the wdwe devices the oxygen transfer from the atmosphere to wave water is considered and it is expressed as follows moo young et al 1985 özbek and gayik 2001 8 d c d t k a c s c where c is the do concentration k is the liquid film mass transfer coefficient on the wave surface a is the specific interfacial area for wave water ka is the oxygen transfer coefficient and c s is the saturation do concentration related to the water temperature and pressure by integrating eq 8 over time the relative saturation coefficient e can be obtained from 9 e c 1 c 0 c s c 0 1 exp k a δ t where c 0 and c 1 are the average do concentrations at the initial time and the present time respectively δt is the duration between c 0 and c 1 eq 9 can be represented as 10 k a ln 1 e δ t for the regular wave without the device effect the oxygen transfer coefficient ka can be obtained using the empirical formulas proposed by daniil and gulliver 1991 and k is written as follows 11 k 0 0159 h s c 0 5 t where sc is the schmidt number eq 11 is rather simple however it has been well validated with the results reported by downing and truesdale 1955 and nguyen and tan 2013 the specific interfacial area a is defined as the ratio of the wave surface area per unit width under a wave length scope a to the water volume per unit width under a wave length scope v 12 a a v a in eq 12 can be obtained from 13 a 2 0 l 2 1 π 2 h 2 l 2 cos 2 2 π l x d x fig 19 shows the oxygen transfer coefficient versus the incident wave height in both regular and irregular waves the data points in solid lines and dashed lines denote the ka results obtained using the experimental data in regular and irregular waves respectively the data points in dotted lines represent the ka results in regular waves calculated from eqs 11 13 for the experimental ka in regular waves the results show that the oxygen transfer coefficient increases as the incident wave height increases the largest oxygen transfer coefficient occurs when t 2 7 s and h 0 18 m is tested note that the oxygen transfer coefficient increases rapidly as the incident wave height increases for t 2 4 s indicating that ka is highly sensitive to the variations of h for this wave period a possible reason for this observation is that the wave period of 2 4 s is close to the natural heave period of the devices the experimental ka in irregular waves shows a similar feature to those in regular waves the oxygen transfer coefficient increases as the significant wave height increases for three spectral peak periods among the three different spectral peak periods the tests for t p 2 56 s have larger oxygen transfer coefficients ranging from 1 37 10 3 s 1 to 1 65 10 3 s 1 the oxygen transfer coefficients under the device effect in regular waves are approximately six times larger than those in irregular waves this also explains that the do concentration of dop 2 maintains at a high level for t 100 s in fig 18 a and the do concentration of dop 2 is always lower than that of dop 3 for t 40 s in fig 18 b a comparison of the ka results from the experimental data shows that the oxygen transfer coefficients under the device effect in regular and irregular waves range from 4 09 10 3 s 1 to 1 36 10 2 s 1 and 8 19 10 4 s 1 to 1 65 10 3 s 1 respectively however for the results of empirical formulas without the device effect in regular waves the oxygen transfer coefficients range from 6 10 10 5 s 1 to 1 18 10 4 s 1 therefore the oxygen transfer coefficients under the device effect are a few orders of magnitude larger than those without the device effect this further demonstrates the excellent performance of the wdwe devices for enhancing the do concentration in water 5 conclusions in this study an array of wdwe devices arranged in an in line square configuration was proposed to transport superficial oxygen rich water to deep hypoxic zones and alleviate hypoxia in bottom seawater a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to study the hydrodynamic responses of the wdwe devices for different water intake depths under regular and irregular waves the effects of the incident wave height wave period and wave steepness on the heave amplitude and outlet flow rate were analyzed the characteristic values of heave amplitudes and outlet flow rates in regular waves were compared with those in irregular waves furthermore the variation of the oxygen transfer coefficients under the device effect in regular and irregular waves were studied quantitatively based on the experimental results the conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the hydrodynamic responses of the wdwe devices in irregular waves generally follow the same trend as those in regular waves the average heave amplitudes and flow rates increase with the increase of the incident wave height and wave period for regular waves and the significant heave amplitudes and flow rates increase with the increase of significant wave height and spectral peak period for irregular waves the average heave amplitudes and outlet flow rates in regular waves are larger than the significant heave amplitudes and outlet flow rates in irregular waves with increasing wave steepness the relative heave amplitudes decrease but the non dimensional outlet flow rates increase 2 in terms of the overwhelming majority of the cases the characteristic heave amplitudes and outlet flow rates of the upstream device are higher than those of the downstream device for regular and irregular waves the relative heave amplitudes and non dimensional outlet flow rates of the upstream device are higher than those of the downstream device as expected 3 the water intake depth has a significant effect on the characteristic heave amplitudes and outlet flow rates in regular and irregular waves the larger the water intake depth tested in the present study the smaller the characteristic heave amplitudes and outlet flow rates 4 the oxygen transfer coefficient increases with increasing incident wave height in regular and irregular waves the oxygen transfer coefficients under the device effect in regular waves are significantly larger than those in irregular waves in addition the oxygen transfer coefficients under the device effect are also a few orders of magnitude larger than those without the device effect illustrating that the proposed wdwe devices have a good performance of enhancing do concentration in bottom water it should be noted that the present analysis was performed with a constant distance between the array of wdwe devices and with an inline square configuration the investigations with different numbers of devices geometry layouts separating distances and wave directions were not included in this research the effect of these factors on water exchange performance of wdwe devices deserves a careful study in further works in addition the phenomenon of wave near trapping will appear at appropriate wave parameters geometry layouts and separating distances which may result in the higher water exchange efficiency this is an interesting and important prospect for future study credit authorship contribution statement xiutao

20236,to alleviate the hypoxia in bottom seawater an array of innovative wave driven water exchange wdwe devices with heaving buoys was proposed to transport superficial oxygen rich water to deep hypoxic zones the hydrodynamic characteristics of the devices arranged in an in line square configuration were experimentally investigated under regular and irregular waves it is found that the characteristic heave amplitudes and flow rates increase with increasing wave height and wave period the average heave amplitudes and flow rates in regular waves are larger than the significant heave amplitudes and flow rates in irregular waves the relative heave amplitudes decrease but the non dimensional outlet flow rates increase with increasing wave steepness generally the characteristic heave amplitudes and flow rates of the upstream device are higher than those of the downstream device in regular and irregular waves the water intake depth has a negative effect on the characteristic heave amplitudes and flow rates finally the variation in the oxygen transfer coefficients was analyzed the results show that the oxygen transfer coefficients under the device effect are a few orders of magnitude larger than those without the device effect this indicates that the array of wdwe devices can effectively enhance do concentration in bottom waters keywords hypoxia wdwe device heave

2008 the number of dead zones caused by hypoxia in global oceans had grown rapidly to more than 400 diaz and rosenberg 2008 conley et al 2011 schmidtko et al 2017 quantitatively analyzed the global oceanic oxygen levels based on oxygen data collected over the last five decades and pointed out that the do concentrations exhibited a statistically pronounced decline in numerous oceanic regions

seawater eutrophication triggered by pollutants which exacerbates the decomposition of organic matter in bottom water the other is the reduction of vertical exchange action between the oxygen rich surface water and bottom water with low oxygen content mainly due to seawater stratification driven by global warming caddy 1993 diaz 2001 taking into consideration the above factors koweek et al 2020

utilization of ocean wave energy many different wave energy converter wec concepts have been proposed to extract clean energy from wave motion including point absorber oscillating water column overtopping and wave activated bodies mustapa et al 2017 as one of the most representative point absorber wecs the heaving buoy has the advantages of relatively high energy conversion efficiency and strong adaptability under various wave conditions a large amount of studies have been reported on the hydrodynamic characteristics of a single heaving buoy falcão et al 2012 jahangir et al 2018 zang et al 2018 shi et al 2019 these studies have helped extend the knowledge regarding its dynamic behavior and power absorption however the energy capture capability for a single heaving buoy is relatively small and an array of buoys was proposed to enhance the energy capture capability garnaud and mei 2009 theoretically evaluated the hydrodynamics and power extraction efficiency of a compact array of small buoys erselcan and kükner 2017 reported that the energy generated by each wec in arrays was less than that generated by a single wec borgarino et al 2012 assessed the interactions between arrays of point absorber wecs with relatively large separating distances and they pointed out that the decrease in the energy absorption was partially compensated by the diffracted and radiated waves in the array numerical simulations were carried out by kara 2016 to investigate the energy absorption in both sway and heave modes the results showed that the wave interactions were stronger at any wave directions and separating distances if the bodies in arrays were close de andrés et al 2014 investigated the effect of array arrangement separating distance number of wecs and wave direction on wave energy array behavior it was found that the square configurations and the triangular configurations were optimum for unidirectional wave climates and multidirectional wave climates respectively in addition the wave energy can be applied to enhance vertical water exchange and alleviate the hypoxia in bottom water margheritini and claeson 2011 introduced the wave energized baltic aeration pump for collecting overtopping water to oxygenate bottom seawater antonini et al 2012 2015 2016 performed both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations on a wave driven oxyflux device to investigate its dynamic responses and pumping capacity under different wave conditions yin et al 2020 developed a wave driven device with a single buoy to transport surface water to deep zones and the hydrodynamic behavior and oxygen transfer performance were experimentally and numerically studied with various wave parameters xiao et al 2018 proposed a tidal pump to alleviate the hypoxic waters and analyzed the effects of tidal current speed immersed length and pump geometry on the downwelling flow rate theoretically and experimentally inspired by the arrays of point absorber wecs aforementioned this study presents an array of wave driven water exchange wdwe devices arranged in an in line square configuration as an extension of the device with a single buoy proposed by yin et al 2020 the objective of this study is to assess the different hydrodynamic performance of the upstream device and downstream device and qualitatively describe the effect of wdwe devices on the changes of do concentration in order to achieve these goals a series of laboratory experiments were carried out to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics in both regular and irregular waves the heaving response of buoys and the flow process at the outlet tube were measured for four different water intake depths the heave amplitudes and outlet flow rates were subsequently calculated the effects of the incident wave parameters on the heave amplitude and outlet flow rate were analyzed in addition the average heave amplitudes and outlet flow rates in regular waves were compared with the significant heave amplitudes and flow rates in irregular waves finally the effect of the wdwe devices on the oxygen transfer coefficient variations was also studied in regular and irregular waves 2 conceptual design 2 1 structure sketch the proposed wdwe devices with heaving buoys are inspired by the arrays of point absorber wecs and are an extension of the device with a single buoy presented by yin et al 2020 as shown in fig 1 a the array of wdwe devices consists of four independent devices therefore it theoretically has the advantage of higher wave energy capture performance compared with a single buoy device the structure of a single wdwe device presented in detail in fig 1 b can be divided into three parts heaving components water exchange components and supporting components the heaving components include a hollow cylindrical buoy to absorb incident wave energy which is connected to two pins a piston to suck and extrude water and a connecting rod to connect the buoy and the piston the main part of the water exchange components comprises a hydraulic cylinder to store the oxygen rich water the water inlet and outlet tubes are linked to the hydraulic cylinder by a one way inlet valve and outlet valve respectively a venthole is opened at the top of the hydraulic cylinder to ensure air exchange between the area above the piston and the outside atmosphere for minimizing the air resistance at the top of the piston the supporting components are a combination of a square gravity base to maintain stability under the action of wave two cylindrical slide bars to control the vertical motion of the heaving components through the two pins and a square supporting frame to fix the hydraulic cylinder with the help of the two cylindrical slide bars 2 2 heave motion and operation principle the heave motion of the buoy can be expressed by newton s second law the governing equation is as follows 1 m z t c b z t k z t f t where m is the total mass of the system which includes the net mass of the heaving components and the additional mass of the water body z t z t and z t denote the instantaneous acceleration velocity and vertical displacement of the heaving components respectively c b is the equivalent damping coefficient of the system which is a combination of the structural damping coefficient induced by friction and the external damping coefficient due to water suction and extrusion k is the hydrostatic restoring force coefficient expressed as k ρgs where s is the cross sectional area of the buoy ρ is the fluid density and g is the acceleration of gravity f t is the wave excitation force on the heaving components which is directly related to the wave conditions the operation principle of the device is simple with the increase of wave surface elevation the heaving components move from the low to the high position along the slide bars under the combined effects of buoyancy and wave excitation force and the internal pressure between the pistons and the bottom of the hydraulic cylinders decreases the surface oxygen rich water is sucked into the hydraulic cylinders through the water inlet tubes and one way inlet valves with the decrease of wave surface elevation the heaving components move from the high position back to the low position owing mainly to the gravity effect and the internal pressure between the pistons and the bottom of the hydraulic cylinders increases as a result the oxygen rich water stored in the hydraulic cylinders is extruded in the deep hypoxic zone through the water outlet tubes and the one way outlet valves and the do concentration in the deep hypoxic zone increases to alleviate the hypoxia problem note that the devices were driven by waves without the consumption of fossil fuels and electricity hence these are both environment friendly and have higher economic efficiency in theory 3 experimental investigation 3 1 experimental setup the present study was limited to a unidirectional wave field in the wave flume and an in line square configuration was adopted as shown in fig 2 a consistent with the optimum configuration reported by de andrés et al 2014 the two upstream buoys were labelled as 1 and 2 respectively and the two downstream buoys were labelled as 3 and 4 note that the hydrodynamic characteristics of wec array were closely related to the separating distance de andrés et al 2014 pointed out that a high conversion efficiency can be achieved when the distance between the wecs was equal to the half of wave length however due to the size limitation of the wave flume the axis distance between two buoys in each row or each column was relatively small as a constant value of 0 32 m in this study and the ratio of separating distance and buoy diameter was 1 45 which was close to the values of 1 30 reported by kara 2016 and 1 50 reported by liu et al 2017 fig 2 b provides a detailed description of the size of each part of a single physical wdwe device model the buoy was a hollow cylinder made of a transparent acrylic plate of 10 mm thickness and its diameter d b and height h b were 0 22 m and 0 08 m respectively the overall average density ρ b of the heaving components was 385 kg m3 the diameter and height of the hydraulic cylinder were 0 05 m and 0 45 m respectively the length of the slide bar was 0 90 m and the distance between the gravity base bottom and the supporting frame was 0 27 m the diameter of the water inlet and outlet tubes was 0 012 m a decay test was conducted to measure the natural period of the heaving buoy with a value of 2 5 s in still water and the corresponding natural frequency was 2 51 rad s a series of experiments were conducted in a wave flume at the hydrodynamic laboratory of ocean university of china fig 3 shows a schematic profile of the wave flume the length depth and width of the wave flume were 25 0 m 1 2 m and 1 0 m respectively a piston type wave paddle was installed at one end of the flume to generate the desired regular and irregular waves a sponge type wave absorber was fixed at the other end to absorb waves and minimize the wave reflection a cartesian coordinate system was set with the positive x axis along the incident wave propagation direction and the positive z axis along the upward direction x 0 at the balanced position of the wave paddle and z 0 at the still water surface the locations of the wdwe devices and their corresponding x coordinates are also presented in fig 3 the central axes of the upstream and downstream buoys were positioned at x 12 m and x 12 32 m respectively buoys 1 and 2 as well as buoys 3 and 4 were arranged symmetrically on the two sides of the longitudinal centerline of the flume the heave motion and water exchange performance of the two upstream buoys and two downstream buoys were almost identical to each other hence buoys 1 and 3 were selected to represent the upstream and downstream buoys respectively throughout the experiments the exit of each water outlet tube was fixed at 0 02 m from the flume bottom the water intake depth h in i e the vertical distance between the intake of the water inlet tube and the still water surface was varied to consider its effect on the hydrodynamic characteristics two displacement sensors with an accuracy of 0 0001 m were used to measure the vertical displacement histories of buoys 1 and 3 the two ends of the displacement sensors were fixed on the top portions of the heaving components and a transverse structure at the top of wave flume two flowmeters were attached to the outlet tubes of buoys 1 and 3 to measure the flow rate four wave gauges with a sampling frequency of 50 hz were installed to measure the wave height histories one was placed behind the array of wdwe devices to measure the wave transmission and the other three wave gauges were placed in front of the devices to identify the incident and reflected waves the do concentration measurements were performed using three jpb 607a do probes dops with an accuracy of 0 10 mg l after calibration with the winkler technique yakushev et al 2012 as shown in fig 3 dop 1 was placed in the middle of the devices and the wave paddle and dop 2 and dop 3 were placed within the vicinity of the intake of the water inlet tube and the exit of the water outlet tube respectively during the experiments the range of water temperature was measured from 20 1 c to 20 3 c and the effect of such small temperature changes on the do concentration can be neglected 3 2 experimental conditions in this study the experiments were classified into two groups one group explored the hydrodynamic characteristics including the heave amplitudes and the outlet flow rates of the array of wdwe devices in regular and irregular waves the other group sought to quantify the changes in the do concentration of water under the action of the wdwe devices table 1 lists the 200 experimental scenarios for exploring the hydrodynamic characteristics incident regular waves with heights h between 0 12 m and 0 20 m with an interval of 0 02 m and periods t between 1 5 s and 2 7 s with an interval of 0 3 s were generated with respect to irregular waves the jonswap spectrum goda 2000 was adopted to generate irregular waves because of its ability to describe sea conditions realistically the combination of five significant wave heights h s and five different spectral peak periods t p yielded a total of 25 unique wave conditions in addition the water intake depth h in was varied from 0 13 m to 0 25 m with an interval of 0 04 m table 2 lists the experimental scenarios for do concentration measurement along with the effects of the array of wdwe devices in these scenarios the water intake depth h in of 0 17 m remained constant to simplify the research for regular waves the wave heights h and wave periods t ranged from 0 12 m to 0 18 m with an interval of 0 02 m and 2 1 s to 2 7 s with an interval of 0 3 s respectively for irregular waves four significant wave heights h s of 0 12 m 0 14 m 0 16 m and 0 18 m and three spectral peak periods t p of 1 71 s 2 05 s and 2 56 s are considered a total of 24 experimental tests were performed to examine the do concentration note that due to the excessive time required for the recovery of do concentration without the wdwe device effect the do concentration measurement was not conducted in the absence of the wdwe in this study alternatively the empirical equations were applied to investigate the effect of waves on oxygen transfer performance a detailed description of the empirical equations can be found in section 4 3 3 3 experimental procedures prior to the experiments for hydrodynamic characteristic investigation the array of wdwe devices and the aforementioned measuring instruments were fixed at the desired locations the intake of the water inlet tubes and the exit of the water outlet tubes must be fixed at the surface oxygen rich zone and deep hypoxic zone respectively the wave flume was filled with freshwater to a still water depth h of 0 5 m and then the wave paddle began generating the desired regular and irregular waves the time histories of the wave surface elevation heave amplitude and outlet flow rate were measured by the wave gauges displacement sensors and flowmeters respectively with respect to the experiments for do concentration measurements an additional operating procedure was required to consume the do concentration in the water therefore the appropriate amount of sodium sulfite na2so3 powder with the catalyst of cobalt chloride cocl2 was thrown uniformly into the whole flume before wave generation bekassy molnar et al 1997 because the densities of na2so3 and cocl2 were higher than that of water their concentration in deep water was relatively higher than in surface water the do near the bottom of the flume was greatly consumed and a hypoxic environment was induced in addition the do concentration of surface water was relatively higher owing to lower na2so3 and cocl2 concentrations and the facilitation of oxygen transfer from the atmosphere as a result the vertical stratification of do concentration was artificially created in the water flume it should be noted that na2so3 and cocl2 must stand in the wave flume for more than 30 min before wave generation to ensure the complete reaction of do and na2so3 then the wave paddle started to generate the desired waves and the do concentrations were measured by the dops 3 4 data processing the evaluation of the hydrodynamic responses plays a significant role in the design and operation of wecs in this study the characteristic heave amplitudes i e the average heave amplitude z a in regular waves and the significant heave amplitude z s in irregular waves are used to quantify the heave response performance of buoys the former is defined as the average value of the heave range of the buoy in each motion period obtained by z a 1 n i 1 n z max i z min i where n is the number of buoy motion periods and is equal to the number of wave periods z max i and z min i are the highest and lowest locations of the buoy in the ith motion period respectively the latter is defined as the average value of the highest one third of the measured heave amplitudes of the buoy in irregular waves similarly the characteristic outlet flow rates of the wdwe devices i e the average outlet flow rate q a in regular waves and the significant outlet flow rate q s in irregular waves are used to quantify water exchange performance of devices the average outlet flow rate is defined as the average value of the instantaneous outlet flow rate over the entire test period and the significant outlet flow rate is defined as the average value of the highest one third of the instantaneous outlet flow rate over the entire test period note that each of test was repeated three times to assure the consistency of experimental measurements the deviation for three repeated tests was calculated by e i x i x x where x i is the variable i e the characteristic heave amplitude or the characteristic outlet flow rate in ith test for one case and i 1 2 3 x is the average value of three repeated tests defined as x x 1 x 2 x 3 3 it is found that e 1 e 2 and e 3 values are all less than 8 which indicates the acceptable accuracy of experimental measurement in addition the average values of three repeated tests were used to represent the characteristic heave amplitudes and outlet flow rates 4 results and discussion 4 1 heave motion of buoys fig 4 presents the time series of heave displacements z of buoys 1 and 3 for h in 0 21 m h 0 12 m and t 1 5 s under regular waves the wave surface elevation η at x 12 m without the device effect is also shown in fig 4 for reference note that the wave surface elevation η at x 12 m cannot be measured directly using the wave gauges because its position overlaps with that of the devices therefore it is calculated using the linear wave propagation theory based on the wave surface elevations recorded by wg3 at x 10 m it is found that the range of heave motions of the two buoys is obviously less than the incident wave height the maximum heave displacements of buoy 1 are slightly larger than those of buoy 3 the heave periods of buoys 1 and 3 are the same as the wave period but there is a relatively obvious phase difference approximately π 2 between the heave motion of buoys and the wave surface elevation furthermore because the position of buoy 3 is downstream of the wave flume relative to buoy 1 as shown in fig 2 a a small phase difference approximately 0 27π between the heave motions of buoys 1 and 3 is also observed irregular waves are known to be more accurate in representing real ocean wave conditions hence understanding the hydrodynamic responses of the devices under irregular waves is of scientific significance and engineering value in this study the jonswap spectrum goda 2000 is selected to generate irregular waves the spectrum density s f is denoted as follows 2 s f β j h s 2 t p 4 f 5 exp 1 25 t p f 4 γ exp t p f 1 2 2 σ 2 where f is the wave frequency and h s is the significant wave height which can be defined as the average value of the highest one third of the measured wave heights γ is the peak lifting factor which is typically selected as 3 3 the coefficient β j can be expressed as follows 3 β j 0 06238 1 094 0 01915 ln γ 0 230 0336 γ 0 185 1 9 γ 1 the spectral peak period t p can be expressed as follows 4 t p t 1 3 1 0 132 γ 0 2 0 559 σ is the peak shape parameter the value of which is defined as 5 σ 0 07 f f p 0 09 f f p where f p is the peak frequency which is equal to the inverse of t p the fast fourier transform method is adopted to obtain the energy density spectrum of irregular wave trains measured in the experiments fig 5 shows a comparison of the measured and theoretical wave spectrum of the irregular wave train without the device effect for h s 0 16 m and t p 2 05 s it is observed that the wave spectrum measured in the experiment is close to the theoretical values both the measured peak frequency and the corresponding s f value are in good agreement with the theoretical wave spectrum fig 6 shows the time series of wave surface elevation η and experimental heave displacements z of buoys 1 and 3 for h in 0 25 m h s 0 14 m and t p 1 71 s under irregular waves the heave motions of the two buoys in irregular waves for wide range between t 40 s 70 s and 80 s 100 s exhibit close similarities with those in regular waves the range of heave motions is obviously less than the incident wave height and a phase difference can be found between the motions of the buoys and the wave surface elevation when the time series is in the range of 70 s 80 s buoys 1 and 3 are almost in the quiescent state which is similar to the results obtained by zang et al 2018 the reason for this phenomenon is that the incident wave heights in this time period are relatively small and the wave excitation force is not sufficiently large to overcome the damping force induced by friction and water suction and extrusion fig 7 shows the variation of the average heave amplitude z a with respect to the incident wave height h for regular waves each inset of fig 7 corresponds to different water intake depths h in it is observed that both the z a values of buoy 1 and 3 increase with the increase of wave height although there are some intersections between the z a curves of buoy 1 and 3 in each inset of fig 7 the z a values of buoy 3 are generally lower than those of buoy 1 one explanation for this is that the presence of the upstream buoy 1 reduces the wave forces on the downstream buoy 3 it is worth noting that the z a of buoy 3 exceeds those of buoy 1 for t 1 5 s in fig 7 d and a similar conclusion was reported by liu et al 2017 that the heave amplitude of the front buoy was less than that of the rear buoy for a compact buoy array type wec the accurate reason is unclear and this may be due to the complex interactions between the incident waves reflected waves radiated waves and the array of wdwe devices in addition fig 7 a and b show that the z a values of buoys 1 and 3 range from 1 68 cm to 5 58 cm for h in 0 13 m and h in 0 17 m fig 7 c and d show that the z a values of buoys 1 and 3 range from 1 11 cm to 5 12 cm for h in 0 21 m and h in 0 25 m these indicate that the water intake depth plays a negative role in the heave motions of both the upstream and downstream buoys fig 8 shows the variation of the significant heave amplitude z s with significant wave height h s for irregular waves the results indicate that the relationship between the significant heave amplitude and significant wave height in irregular waves generally has the same trend as that in regular waves i e the z s values increase with increasing h s the increasing rate of z s is closely associated with h in with the increase of h s from 0 14 m to 0 22 m for h in 0 13 m and t p 1 28 s z s increases significantly from 0 94 cm to 2 07 cm for buoy 1 and from 0 69 cm to 1 94 cm for buoy 3 in fig 8 a whereas for h in 0 25 m and t p 1 28 s as shown in fig 8 d the increase of h s causes the z s of buoys 1 and 3 to increase slightly from 0 53 cm to 1 32 cm and 0 47 cm to 1 29 cm respectively moreover it can be clearly seen that z s of buoy 3 is smaller than that of buoy 1 for irregular waves for instance the mean value of z s for buoy 1 in fig 8 a is 2 08 cm which is larger than 1 89 cm for buoy 3 figs 9 and 10 show the characteristic heave amplitude versus wave period for regular and irregular waves respectively similarly four different water intake depths h in 0 13 m 0 17 m 0 21 m and 0 25 m are considered both z a and z s increase with increasing wave period with the exception of some outliers of buoy 3 for t p 1 71 s in fig 10 a in fig 9 buoys 1 and 3 have larger average heave amplitudes ranging from 1 11 cm to 5 93 cm while for irregular waves in fig 10 the significant heave amplitudes z s are within the range of 0 47 cm 3 37 cm in the scenarios with h in 0 21 m and h h s 0 14 m the z a values of buoys 1 and 3 for regular waves of t 2 1 s in fig 9 c are 2 42 cm and 2 08 cm respectively the z s values of buoys 1 and 3 for irregular waves of t p 2 05 s in fig 10 c are 1 66 cm and 1 40 cm respectively therefore the z a in regular waves is larger than the z s in irregular waves for similar values of wave height and period for the four water intake depths in our experiments the smallest heave amplitudes occur when h in 0 25 m is tested for both regular and irregular waves z a under regular waves and z s under irregular waves for h in 0 25 m are within the range of 1 11 cm 4 72 cm and 0 47 cm 2 79 cm respectively the largest heave amplitudes occur when h in 0 13 m and the characteristic heave amplitudes for this water intake depth range from 1 68 cm to 5 63 cm and 0 69 cm 3 37 cm under regular and irregular waves respectively to further explore the intrinsic relationship between the wave parameters and the heave motion of the buoys the relationships between two non dimensional parameters i e the relative heave amplitude and wave steepness are discussed for regular waves the relative heave amplitude is the ratio of the average heave amplitude z a to the wave height h the wave steepness λ is defined as follows 6 λ h l where l is the wavelength that can be calculated using the linear dispersion relationship l g t 2 2 π tanh k 0 d where k 0 is the wave number and k 0 2π l for irregular waves the relative heave amplitude is the ratio of the significant heave amplitude z s to the significant wave height h s the significant wave steepness λ s can be estimated as follows det norske veritas 2010 7 λ s k p h s 2 π where k p is wave number corresponding to the spectral peak period t p fig 11 shows the relationship between z a h and λ for different water intake depths h in for reference two auxiliary lines are shown in each inset of fig 11 to fit the data points using the power function z a h αλ β the fitted z a h values decrease with increasing λ for every water intake depth scenario however the decreasing rate is also closely associated with h in for the smallest h in 0 13 m scenario in fig 11 a the z a h values of buoy 1 and 3 decrease from 0 416 to 0 129 and 0 406 to 0 127 respectively with increasing λ for the largest h in 0 25 m scenario in fig 11 d the z a h values of buoy 1 and 3 decrease from 0 250 to 0 093 and from 0 257 to 0 123 respectively with increasing λ because the presence of the upstream buoy 1 reduces the wave forces acting on the downstream buoy 3 the fitted z a h values of buoy 1 are higher than those of buoy 3 except for the largest water intake depth as shown in fig 11 d a possible reason for this observation is that a larger water intake depth corresponding to a higher damping force of water suction inhibits the heave motion of buoy 1 this may weaken the shelter effect of upstream buoy 1 on the downstream buoy 3 hence the z a h values of buoy 3 are higher than those of buoy 1 the correlation coefficients r 2 between z a h and λ of buoy 1 and 3 in fig 11 a and b are higher than those in fig 11 c and d indicating that the data have a marginally larger scatter for a larger water intake depth the correlation coefficient r 2 of buoy 3 is generally lower than that of buoy 1 illustrating that buoy 3 is more susceptible to complex interactions between the incident wave the wave reflected from the devices and the radiated waves produced by buoy motion fig 12 shows the relationship between z s h s and λ s for different water intake depths h in two auxiliary lines are drawn in each inset to fit the data points using the power function z s h s αλ s β a comparison of the data plots for buoys 1 and 3 in each inset of fig 12 reveals that the z s h s values of the upstream buoy are larger than those of the downstream buoy similar to the results for regular waves in fig 11 the fitted z s h s values decrease with increasing λ s for every water intake depth scenario the comparison of z a h in regular waves and z s h s in irregular waves shows that the results of z a h in regular waves are generally larger than z s h s in irregular waves for similar values of λ and λ s for instance the z a h values of buoy 1 in regular waves for h in 0 21 m range from 0 118 to 0 312 in fig 11 c which are generally higher than the z s h s values ranging from 0 067 to 0 129 in fig 12 c another trend is that the deviation between the data points and the auxiliary lines in fig 12 is more significant than that in fig 11 indicating that the results for irregular waves appear more scattered than those for regular waves this is due mainly to the more complex interactions between the incident wave reflected wave and radiated wave under irregular waves 4 2 outlet flow rate fig 13 shows the variation of the average outlet flow rate q a with respect to the incident wave height h for regular waves each inset of fig 13 corresponds to different water intake depths h in owing to the complexity of the interactions between waves and the devices the nonlinearity between the average outlet flow rate and incident wave height is obvious and some overlaps and intersections between the q a curves of buoy 1 and 3 can also be observed however in general both the average outlet flow rates of buoy 1 and 3 increase with the increase of wave height as h increases from 0 12 m to 0 20 m the q a values for h in 0 13 m in fig 13 a increase from 6 18 ml s to 11 51 ml s in fig 13 a b and c the q a values of buoy 1 are generally larger than those of buoy 3 for instance the average q a value of buoy 1 is 9 72 ml s in fig 13 a while that of buoy 3 is 8 92 ml s however the average q a value of buoy 1 is less than that of buoy 3 in fig 13 d these results are consistent with the relationship between z a and h as shown in fig 7 fig 14 shows the variation of the significant outlet flow rate q s with respect to the significant wave height h s for irregular waves the significant outlet flow rate versus significant wave height in irregular waves generally has the same trend as that in regular waves q s increases as h s increases and the q s values of buoy 1 are generally larger than those of buoy 3 among the four different water intake depths in fig 14 the largest q s occurs when h in 0 13 m is tested the significant outlet flow rates of buoy 1 and 3 for this water intake depth range from q s 3 00 ml s to 8 96 ml s for the largest h in 0 25 m the significant outlet flow rates of buoy 1 and 3 are relatively small ranging from q s 2 04 ml s to 6 74 ml s to further investigate the water transport performance of the array of wdwe devices under different wave conditions the relationship between the non dimensional outlet flow rate and wave steepness is analyzed fig 15 shows the variation of the non dimensional outlet flow rate q a d b 2 g t with respect to wave steepness λ in regular waves the power function q a d b 2 g t α λ β is used to fit the scattered data points the results show a general trend of the non dimensional outlet flow rate increasing monotonically with increasing wave steepness fig 15 a b and c show that the q a d b 2 g t values of buoy 1 are generally larger than those of buoy 3 and the largest difference between q a d b 2 g t values of buoy 1 and buoy 3 occurs for the smallest h in 0 13 m however the fitted q a d b 2 g t values of buoy 3 are higher than those of buoy 1 for the largest h in 0 25 m scenario in fig 15 d the two fitted curves in each inset show that the difference between the non dimensional outlet flow rates of buoy 1 and buoy 3 increases as the wave steepness increases this illustrates that the difference between the outlet flow rates of buoy 1 and buoy 3 becomes increasingly obvious for larger steepness fig 16 shows the relationship between q s d b 2 g t p and λ s for different water intake depths h in the scattered data points are also fitted by the power function q s d b 2 g t p α λ s β the results show that the fitted q s d b 2 g t p values increase with increasing λ s for irregular waves this trend is similar to the results in regular waves shown in fig 15 however the q s d b 2 g t p values in irregular waves are generally less than q a d b 2 g t values in regular waves for instance the q s d b 2 g t p values of buoy 1 in irregular waves for h in 0 25 m range from 2 63 10 6 to 9 64 10 6 in fig 16 d whereas the q a d b 2 g t values range between 4 70 10 6 to 1 37 10 5 in fig 15 d because the nonlinearity is relatively significant between q a and h in regular waves as shown in fig 13 the correlation coefficients r 2 in fig 15 are generally less than those in fig 16 as an extension of the device with a single buoy presented by yin et al 2020 the water exchange performance of the array of wdwe devices could be very different from the single device fig 17 shows a preliminary comparison of the non dimensional outlet flow rate q a d b 2 g t in regular waves between the array of devices and the single device used in yin et al 2020 note that h in in yin et al 2020 was recalculated as the vertical distance between the intake of the water inlet tube and the still water surface to make it consistent with the definition of h in in this study and the cases with h in 0 15 m presented by yin et al 2020 were selected for the comparison because this water intake depth was close to h in 0 13 m in this study it is found that the fitted q a d b 2 g t values of buoy 1 buoy 3 and the single device increase with increasing λ basically the fitted q a d b 2 g t values of buoy 1 and buoy 3 are markedly lower than those of the single device this indicates that the hydrodynamic interaction of the array of devices has negative effect on the water exchange performance which is in agreement with the conclusion drawn by erselcan and kükner 2017 as a result the total outlet flow rate of the array of wdwe devices is unable to achieve 4 times that of a single device in addition the data points of q a d b 2 g t reported by yin et al 2020 are relatively scattered a possible reason is that q a d b 2 g t and λ do not take into account the effect of the density and height of buoy however the density and height of buoy are 295 kg m3 and 0 12 m respectively in yin et al 2020 which are different from 385 kg m3 and 0 08 m in the present study for irregular waves the significant wave steepness under irregular waves used in this study and yin et al 2020 ranges respectively from 0 026 to 0 097 and 0 009 to 0 033 the λ s difference is too large to compare their water exchange performance directly therefore the comparison of the water exchange performance for irregular waves is not included in this study 4 3 do concentration fig 18 shows the time series of do concentrations measured by three dops for both regular and irregular waves for comparison the incident wave height h of 0 12 m in regular waves is equal to the significant wave height h s in irregular waves and the regular wave period t 2 7 s approaches the spectral peak period t p 2 56 s in irregular waves the results show that the do concentrations measured by dop 1 and dop 3 are very small at the initial time however the do concentration measured by dop 2 is relatively high this indicates the obvious vertical stratification of the do concentration at the initial time for regular waves as shown in fig 18 a the do concentration measured by dop 3 near the exit of the water outlet tube increases linearly between 0 s and 70 s owing to the intermittent release of oxygen rich water from the hydraulic cylinders then it remains within the range of 3 1 mg l to 3 4 mg l do concentration measured by dop 2 abruptly increases within a short period of time and reaches the maximum value because dop 2 is located near the wave surface then the released water from the exit of the water outlet tube squeezes the surrounding hypoxic water to the dop 2 location thus the do concentration of dop 2 is slightly reduced and remains within the range of 3 0 mg l to 3 2 mg l between 20 s and 85 s as a result the phenomenon that the do concentration of dop 2 is lower than that of dop 3 is observed between 20 s and 100 s in fig 18 a however due to the good oxygen transfer performance caused by the high outlet flow rate and uniform distribution of do concentrations in water depth direction for regular waves the do concentration of dop 2 increases and then maintains at a high level for t 100 s and it is no longer less than that of dop 3 for t 300 s because dop 1 is relatively far from the exit of the water outlet tube the fluctuation of do concentration is observed between 30 s and 300 s and the do concentration increases slowly and smoothly between 300 s and 600 s as shown in fig 18 b the time series of do concentrations measured by dops 1 and 3 for irregular waves show a similar trend as those for regular waves due to the released oxygen rich water from the outlet tube the do concentration of dop 3 first increases rapidly and then maintains a relatively high value the do concentration of dop 1 first presents a pattern of fluctuation before 600 s and then increases obviously between 600 s and 800 s for dop 2 the do concentration first increases rapidly and then decreases slightly however because of the small outlet flow rate and inferior water exchange performance for irregular waves the increase of do concentration of dop 2 is not observed in fig 18 b more specifically due to the combined effects of the vertical exchange between bottom hypoxic water and surface oxygen rich water and the oxygen transfer from the atmosphere to water through wave surface the do concentration of dop 2 varies little for t 100 s and it is slightly lower than that of dop 1 after 760 s in summary fig 18 shows that the do concentration measured by dop 3 first increases rapidly and then maintains a high value along the time series for both regular and irregular waves in addition the do concentrations measured by dop 1 are smaller than those measured by dop 3 in the range of t 600 s for regular waves and t 800 s for irregular waves this indicates that the proposed array of wdwe devices can improve do concentration near the outlet tube exit in a short duration to qualitatively describe the changes in do concentration of the water under the action of the wdwe devices the oxygen transfer from the atmosphere to wave water is considered and it is expressed as follows moo young et al 1985 özbek and gayik 2001 8 d c d t k a c s c where c is the do concentration k is the liquid film mass transfer coefficient on the wave surface a is the specific interfacial area for wave water ka is the oxygen transfer coefficient and c s is the saturation do concentration related to the water temperature and pressure by integrating eq 8 over time the relative saturation coefficient e can be obtained from 9 e c 1 c 0 c s c 0 1 exp k a δ t where c 0 and c 1 are the average do concentrations at the initial time and the present time respectively δt is the duration between c 0 and c 1 eq 9 can be represented as 10 k a ln 1 e δ t for the regular wave without the device effect the oxygen transfer coefficient ka can be obtained using the empirical formulas proposed by daniil and gulliver 1991 and k is written as follows 11 k 0 0159 h s c 0 5 t where sc is the schmidt number eq 11 is rather simple however it has been well validated with the results reported by downing and truesdale 1955 and nguyen and tan 2013 the specific interfacial area a is defined as the ratio of the wave surface area per unit width under a wave length scope a to the water volume per unit width under a wave length scope v 12 a a v a in eq 12 can be obtained from 13 a 2 0 l 2 1 π 2 h 2 l 2 cos 2 2 π l x d x fig 19 shows the oxygen transfer coefficient versus the incident wave height in both regular and irregular waves the data points in solid lines and dashed lines denote the ka results obtained using the experimental data in regular and irregular waves respectively the data points in dotted lines represent the ka results in regular waves calculated from eqs 11 13 for the experimental ka in regular waves the results show that the oxygen transfer coefficient increases as the incident wave height increases the largest oxygen transfer coefficient occurs when t 2 7 s and h 0 18 m is tested note that the oxygen transfer coefficient increases rapidly as the incident wave height increases for t 2 4 s indicating that ka is highly sensitive to the variations of h for this wave period a possible reason for this observation is that the wave period of 2 4 s is close to the natural heave period of the devices the experimental ka in irregular waves shows a similar feature to those in regular waves the oxygen transfer coefficient increases as the significant wave height increases for three spectral peak periods among the three different spectral peak periods the tests for t p 2 56 s have larger oxygen transfer coefficients ranging from 1 37 10 3 s 1 to 1 65 10 3 s 1 the oxygen transfer coefficients under the device effect in regular waves are approximately six times larger than those in irregular waves this also explains that the do concentration of dop 2 maintains at a high level for t 100 s in fig 18 a and the do concentration of dop 2 is always lower than that of dop 3 for t 40 s in fig 18 b a comparison of the ka results from the experimental data shows that the oxygen transfer coefficients under the device effect in regular and irregular waves range from 4 09 10 3 s 1 to 1 36 10 2 s 1 and 8 19 10 4 s 1 to 1 65 10 3 s 1 respectively however for the results of empirical formulas without the device effect in regular waves the oxygen transfer coefficients range from 6 10 10 5 s 1 to 1 18 10 4 s 1 therefore the oxygen transfer coefficients under the device effect are a few orders of magnitude larger than those without the device effect this further demonstrates the excellent performance of the wdwe devices for enhancing the do concentration in water 5 conclusions in this study an array of wdwe devices arranged in an in line square configuration was proposed to transport superficial oxygen rich water to deep hypoxic zones and alleviate hypoxia in bottom seawater a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to study the hydrodynamic responses of the wdwe devices for different water intake depths under regular and irregular waves the effects of the incident wave height wave period and wave steepness on the heave amplitude and outlet flow rate were analyzed the characteristic values of heave amplitudes and outlet flow rates in regular waves were compared with those in irregular waves furthermore the variation of the oxygen transfer coefficients under the device effect in regular and irregular waves were studied quantitatively based on the experimental results the conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the hydrodynamic responses of the wdwe devices in irregular waves generally follow the same trend as those in regular waves the average heave amplitudes and flow rates increase with the increase of the incident wave height and wave period for regular waves and the significant heave amplitudes and flow rates increase with the increase of significant wave height and spectral peak period for irregular waves the average heave amplitudes and outlet flow rates in regular waves are larger than the significant heave amplitudes and outlet flow rates in irregular waves with increasing wave steepness the relative heave amplitudes decrease but the non dimensional outlet flow rates increase 2 in terms of the overwhelming majority of the cases the characteristic heave amplitudes and outlet flow rates of the upstream device are higher than those of the downstream device for regular and irregular waves the relative heave amplitudes and non dimensional outlet flow rates of the upstream device are higher than those of the downstream device as expected 3 the water intake depth has a significant effect on the characteristic heave amplitudes and outlet flow rates in regular and irregular waves the larger the water intake depth tested in the present study the smaller the characteristic heave amplitudes and outlet flow rates 4 the oxygen transfer coefficient increases with increasing incident wave height in regular and irregular waves the oxygen transfer coefficients under the device effect in regular waves are significantly larger than those in irregular waves in addition the oxygen transfer coefficients under the device effect are also a few orders of magnitude larger than those without the device effect illustrating that the proposed wdwe devices have a good performance of enhancing do concentration in bottom water it should be noted that the present analysis was performed with a constant distance between the array of wdwe devices and with an inline square configuration the investigations with different numbers of devices geometry layouts separating distances and wave directions were not included in this research the effect of these factors on water exchange performance of wdwe devices deserves a careful study in further works in addition the phenomenon of wave near trapping will appear at appropriate wave parameters geometry layouts and separating distances which may result in the higher water exchange efficiency this is an interesting and important prospect for future study credit authorship contribution statement xiutao

20237,the subsea tree acts as an important role in underwater production system during its installation procedure hydrodynamic loads significantly affect its dynamic performance hence the drag coefficient of the subsea tree is addressed in detail in the paper by experiment and numerical simulation numerical simulation was carried out with finite difference method to get the drag force and drag coefficient a new experimental method was proposed to conduct an array of model experiments for drag coefficient of subsea tree the numerical results in drag coefficient were slightly different with experimental results that was to say the accuracy and reliability of the experimental data were proved the drag coefficient is 0 432 in x direction 0 479 in y direction and 0 446 in z direction which provide the accurate fundamental hydrodynamic data for underwater production system installation keywords drag coefficient subsea tree model tests cfd nomenclature a projected area m2 c d drag

and wire cable θ 2 average angle of four angles between x axis and the projection of wire cables 1 introduction the development of subsea production systems involves many complex procedures with high cost high risk and difficult operations for instance locating the subsea facilities maintaining and clearing pipe routes due to the consumption of onshore oil and gas resources and the aim of guaranteeing the highly effective development performance to reduce cost and contribute to production offshore oil exploitation has been widely carried out in the past decades the subsea production systems have gradually become the mainstream mode for deep water gas and oil resources development li et al 2019 the underwater production system is widely applied for deep water gas and oil field such as liu hua oilfield wen et al 2019 and caspian sea project gable and amadeus 2019 underwater production system mainly includes subsea tree subsea manifold umbilical cable subsea control module subsea distribute unit and so on which are interconnected with production hong et al 2018 in the progress of installing and lowering subsea equipment the equipment usually is directly affected by harsh environment especially in the splash zone in the process of descent stage the interaction between wind wave and current has strong nonlinear coupling effect the loads on the equipment due to the wind wave and current may lead to its structure damage causing installation failure or even safety accidents and hence increase the cost on personnel and equipment s safety bhattacharyya and cheliyan 2019 thus it is very significant to predict the condition of installation of subsea equipment and attain relevant data and predict the dynamic response in installation stage comprehensive studies on prediction of dynamics responses of subsea equipment and the possibility of installation failure before the installation by means of different approaches can be found mao et al 2019 used improved volume of fluid method for forecasting a typical of behavior of an underwater structure during splash zone and comparison between experiment and numerical simulation shows a strong agreement liu et al 2015 put forward a mathematic model of manifold installation and the pipe and proposed the iterative method to solve those questions and applied orcaflex software to prove that the presented method had a good reliability and accuracy banks banks et al 2019 proposed the industrial standard about water content of subsea tree during commissioning period and made a good decision that was not dewatering the flowlines from 4 chooses in juniper development through reducing risks costs and simplifying the schedule the reliability and accuracy of hydrodynamic responses of underwater equipment were depended on hydrodynamic coefficient especially the drag coefficient therefore many researchers undertook lots of studies with different approaches for obtaining hydrodynamic coefficient of underwater equipment and other marine structure ehsan javanmard et al 2020 used a new computational fluid dynamics approach to calculate translational longitudinal and transverse added mass coefficients of an underwater vehicle comparisons are made with those obtained by previous methods and experiments and good agreement are achieved tian et al 2017a carried out the forced oscillation experiment and measured the hydrodynamic forces acting on the oscillating plat with different range of keulegan carpenter number by self designed experimental apparatus and the hydrodynamic coefficients were calculated using morison s equation tang et al 2018 undertook an array of net panel experiment in current in a flume channel to research the effect of different materials knot pattern and net solidity on the drag force and drag coefficient and proposed a formula to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficient of net panels in current martin et al tobiasmartin 2020 investigate following wake of screen and predicted the drag coefficient as a function of the screen solidity with relative turbulence intensity method balash et al 2009 analyzed the hydrodynamic force and mechanical stress acting on the net panel in flume channel and proposed a new formula to modify the original prediction of the drag coefficient of circular cylinder and sphere gu et al 2018 calculated the drag radiation damping and added mass of axisymmetric cylinder e g flat hemisphere and round base float on forced surge and heave motion using commercial software star ccm jin et al 2000 proposed the computational domain could be 6 7 times the size of the structures when simulating hydrodynamic coefficients qi et al 2020 studied on the resistance coefficient and added mass coefficient in the process of manifold deploying but it had low precision because of simplified model that plenty of pipes were simplified as cuboid which might lead to errors between simulated data and experimental data mansoorzadeh et al mansoorzadeh and javanmard 2014 measured the hydrodynamic coefficient of an autonomous subsea vehicle using numerical and experimental method only 1 5 m s and 2 5 m s however in spite of extensive researches of hydrodynamic coefficients in underwater production system such as the works mentioned above there is little on drag coefficient of three dimensional subsea equipment traditionally the hydrodynamic coefficients in ocean engineering were usually obtained via empirical formulas mavrakos 2004 pan et al 2012 rather than numerical simulation or experiment some researchers are studying on the relationship between the drag coefficient and marine structures aguilar et al 2019 avery et al 2019 orth and hendrix 2018 but not involving subsea tree its structure is shown in fig 1 the subsea tree directly affects the oil and gas production of the whole production system by controlling oil pressure and making progress regulatable wang et al 2018 as subsea tree works underwater for a long time it is subjected to hydrodynamic loads from whole production system and steady currents its structure will be scoured by current with different velocity and may experience the heave motion response which may threaten the system and staff consequently it is necessary to research the relationship between drag coefficient and velocity of subsea tree in summary only a few studies related to hydrodynamic coefficients of subsea tree have been performed in this paper the 1 10 scale model of subsea tree was investigated experimentally and numerically a series of model experiments that the velocity is changed from 0 1 to 1 3 m s were conducted to study the drag force and drag coefficient with increase of velocity meanwhile a numerical calculation was conducted in order to validate the results of experiment the comparison between experiment and numerical simulation proves reliability and accuracy of the experimental method further the experimental method in this paper can provide the accurate fundamental hydrodynamic data for underwater production system installation 2 numerical simulation for drag coefficient 2 1 governing equations in the section the reynolds averaged navier stokes equation with turbulence model were applied to simulating viscous flow around subsea tree more specifically turbulence model mainly had two types one is eddy viscosity turbulence model the other is reynold s stress turbulence model the reynolds stress model considers the anisotropy of turbulence and can usually give better results nonetheless the stability of numerical simulation is much less stable than the former model consequently the model of realizable k ε with the enhanced wall was chosen in the section the continuity equation for an incompressible fluid can be written as 1 u i x i 0 where i is general variable which can represent u v w which denote velocity of fluid in x y and z directions respectively navier stokes equation for incompressible fluid can be written as 2 ρ u t d i v ρ u u p x τ x x x τ y x y τ z x z f x ρ v t d i v ρ v v p y τ x y x τ y y y τ z y z f y ρ w t d i v ρ w w p z τ x z x τ y z y τ z z z f z the general form of governing equations can be written as 3 ρ i t ρ u i x ρ v i y ρ w i z x γ i x y γ i y z γ i z s where γ is generalized diffusion coefficient s is generalized source ρ is fluid density and μ is kinematic viscosity coefficient the turbulence model equations can be written as 4 ρ k t ρ k u x i x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k ρ ε ρ ε t ρ ε u x i x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j ρ c 1 e ε c 2 ρ ε 2 k ν ε where u represents the velocity vector of the fluid μ is the dynamic viscosity k denotes the turbulence kinetic energy and ϵ represents the turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate model constants c2 1 9 σ k 1 0 σϵ 1 2 represent the c2 epsilon turbulent kinetic energy tke prandtl number and turbulent dissipation rate tdr prandtl number respectively x i and x j represent the position coordinate components g k is the production term of the tke caused by the average velocity gradient 2 2 subsea tree geometry the main dimensions of the model were 0 5325 m in length 0 3036 m in width and 0 3827 m in height which was shown in fig 3 and table 1 the projection areas in the x y and z directions were 0 1483 0 1890 and 0 2183 m2 respectively the air weight of the subsea tree model was approximately 10 2 kg in steady state averaging the forces during 15s measured by the every sensor f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 can be calculated as respectively 5 f i j m n f j n m 1 i 1 2 3 4 where f is the transient force measured by the sensors during 15s and n m 1 is the sampling amount which usually depends on the sampling frequency the total drag force can be described as 6 f d f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 cos θ 1 cos θ 2 where θ 1 is the average angle of four angles between the o x y plane and wire cable similarly θ 2 is average of four angles between x axis and the projection of wire cables on the o x y plane the design scheme of calculation on the total force of four points is shown in fig 2 similarly we can rotate the subsea tree for changing projection surface of which in towing tank and get the practical drag force of four points acting on the subsea tree in x y and z direction after adjusting the attitude of the subsea tree and which remains stable in the water trailer could be started to pull the model in a straight line for the reason that the motion between the water and subsea tree stays relative the water can be regarded as motionless and subsea tree keeps moving in one dimensional linear motion the drag coefficient c d of the subsea tree can be calculated as below 7 c d 2 f d ρ a v 2 where ρ represents density of the fluid a is the projection area v is the relative velocity between model and fluid and c d is the drag coefficient of model 2 3 computational domain and grid generation the model of the subsea tree and fluid domain were established the model was simplified because the actual subsea tree is too complex eg omitting the screw holes and bolts to promote the meshes generation and numerical computation in order to insure resemblance of hydrodynamic characteristics the shape of the simplified model is similar to actual model and the projected area has little change in x y and z direction in the numerical simulation a scale of 1 10 was chosen to establish the subsea tree model a rectangular block was established as fluid domain in order to promote the option of boundary condition which is illustrated in fig 4 the model of the subsea tree is placed at the center of the rectangular block i e the coordinate origin of subsea tree coincides with geometric center of fluid domain meanwhile x y and z axis in the global coordinate system are along the length width and height direction respectively in order to eliminate the effects of fluid domain boundary on numerical simulation it is necessary to ensure the boundary scale ratio of subsea tree and fluid domain not less than 5 1 tian et al 2017b in the study the dimensions of the fluid domain are 3 5 m long 3 5 m wide and 3 5 m high in order to satisfy both the accuracy and efficiency of numerical calculation a box was established to enclose the whole subsea tree in order to perform local grid refinement in the process of mesh generation 2 4 boundary conditions and numerical method based on the finite difference and other numerical method the below optimal condition of boundary was applied to the present numerical simulation in order to make progress of numerical simulation stable and save average calculating time the solver was adopted to the steady in this section realizable k ε model and wall function were adopted the kinematic viscosity and the density of incompressible fluid were set to be 1 308 10 6 m s and 1000 kg m3 respectively the type of inlet was adopted to the velocity inlet the type of outlet was adopted to the pressure outlet and the wall boundary with the no slip shear conditions as well as stationary wall motion were adopted to subsea tree and other wall boundaries a second order upwind was employed for turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent dissipation rate and a second order central difference scheme was used for the viscous and convective term an algorithm which was pressure implicit with splitting of operators was applied for coupling solution of pressure velocity taking the case of the velocity of 1 3 m s in x direction as an example fig 5 showed that the continuity and other indexes all had good convergence performance and the value were all below 10 4 which represented a high accuracy and stability of the numerical method the drag force was record when the residual was stable see fig 6 2 5 grid independence study for the grid independence study the predicted drag force of the subsea tree in the case of inlet velocity of 0 3 0 8 and 1 3 m s in the x direction was presented fig 7 and table 2 show that the drag force changed along with grid numbers the drag force was stable and accurate when the grid numbers is close to 10 million in the paper approximately 11230000 grid numbers were generated in the following numerical simulation to obtain numerical data which meant that obtained numerical results are grid independent in order to reach a good balance between computation time and calculation accuracy approach of hybrid grid was adopted in order to carry out the local grid refinement unstructured grid was adopted to subsea tree model and other parts were arranged for structure grid of the whole fluid domain the model mesh is illustrated in fig 8 the number of elements generated in computational grid was approximately 11230000 the value of y was 136 there were 10 prismatic layers whose relative dimension thickness was 3 3 mm and growth rate was 1 3 to cover boundary layer additionally the reason for preventing boundary layer s logarithmic region including the centroid of the wall adjacent cell which leads to the rough mesh selected to solve the laminar sublayer the law of the wall that enhance wall treatment was employed 2 6 uncertainty analysis as an uncertainty analysis the grid convergence index gci method was used to assess the capability of the proposed cfd model in solving the system of equations when sufficiently fine grid resolution is employed the gci that is known as an acceptable and recommended method for estimation of discretization error in cfd simulations procedure for estimation 2008 is based on richardson extrapolation re method javanmard et al 2019 for three sets of grids n1 n2 and n3 the grid refinement factors r 21 and r 32 are computed as r 21 h 2 h 1 and r 32 h 3 h 2 where h i is a representative grid size of the ith grid the apparent order of the method p is calculated by 8 p 1 ln r 21 ln ε 21 ε 32 q p 9 q p ln r 21 p s r 32 p s 10 s 1 sgn ε 32 ε 21 where ε 21 φ 2 φ 1 ε 32 φ 3 φ 2 and φ k is the key variable on the kh grid procedure for estimation 2008 javanmard et al 2019 the extrapolated values are obtained via 11 φ e x t 21 r 21 p φ 1 φ 2 r 21 p 1 the approximate and extrapolated relative errors are calculated using the following equations respectively 12 e a 21 φ 1 φ 2 φ 1 13 e e x t 21 φ e x t 21 φ 1 φ e x t 21 14 g c i f i n e 21 1 25 e a 21 r 21 p 1 for the three selected grids calculations of discretization error are presented in table 3 as can be seen numerical uncertainties for computed values were 0 309 and 0 051 respectively therefore regarding grid independence study and numerical uncertainties estimated from verification study it was concluded that the use 11230000 elements not only ensured that the results were grid independent but also was numerically cost effective 3 experimental setup in order to verify the predicted c d by star ccm the experiment was carried out in towing tank of zhejiang ocean university in china the towing tank is 130 m long 3 m wide and 3 5 m deep fig 9 shows the panorama of the tank see fig 10 the first stage is the test model manufacturing the subsea tree in practical engineering has complex geometry which consists of complex pipes slots and bolts the scale ratio is the key factor to determine the test model dimensions if the subsea tree model is too small it would cause lower accuracy of model test owing to the size effect on the contrary it will cause wall effect if the model is too large and wave reflection will be serious in the tank which leads to experimental errors and even worsens the test results in the research the 1 10 scale model of subsea tree was adopted comparing to practical structure in order to ensure the experimental model has the geometrical similarity to actual structure some accurate components such as resinous material steel plate and so on were adopted to control the geometrical shape of the subsea tree model the experimental model for the subsea tree is shown as fig 11 table 1 summarized the main parameters of subsea tree model every experimental apparatus is positioned in the tank which are shown as fig 12 the experimental system is mainly constituted of seven parts i e the towing tank trailer slideway the subsea tree model force sensor cable data acquisition device the trailer could move on the slideway in one dimensional linear motion whose maximum velocity is 3 m s and precision can reach 0 05 m s and the slideway was located on towing tank the subsea tree model was linked with wire cables buckles and any fastenings to the four points at symmetrical beams which locate the bottom of the trailer and four force sensors which are numbered sensor 1 to 4 were positioned at four wire cables respectively to keep a record of drag force acting on the four points of model additionally two g clips are located at each point aiming to increase the strength and stability in the process of test the turnbuckle which can adjust initial pre tightening force to keep the model horizontal in the water are also deployed at wire cables respectively during the model tests the bottom of subsea tree and tank bottom and the top of subsea tree and water surface are always keep a distance to reduce the extra force caused by shear flow or surface wave hence the drag force acting on subsea tree is closer to real situation the data acquiring from four force sensors was recorded and transmitted by the data acquisition device the transient force recorded by the force sensors was applied to eq 5 to calculate the f 1 f 2 f 3 and f 4 and the drag force can be obtained by eq 6 the precision of the force measurement is 0 01 n what s more the subsea tree was linked with the trailer platform by means of a safety rope in order to prevent the subsea tree falling off owing to the strength of the connection and other emergencies in the process of experiment the sketch of connection between the trailer and subsea tree model is presented at fig 13 in this study in order to obtain the drag force and drag coefficient of the subsea tree in three directions three groups of towing tests were carried out by approaches of experiment and numerical calculation respectively in order to reduce the unstable result caused by uncertainty of measurement 13 model experiments with diverse towing velocity were conducted in every direction furtherly the force was recorded through averaging the data obtained by tension sensor during 15s when the velocity stays in the steady state an increment is 0 1 m s by which velocity is changed from 0 1 to 1 3 m s and the precision of trailer then the drag force was obtained at each of the drag velocities 4 result and discussion 4 1 drag force by eq 7 the drag coefficients could be calculated at each of the drag velocities the averages of value of 13 drag coefficients were regarded as drag coefficients of the subsea tree in every direction simulated and measured drag force of the subsea tree in three directions are shown in fig 14 16 respectively meanwhile the fitted curves were both plotted by polynomial fitting it was obvious that the trend of numerical method was quite comparable to experimental method and the drag force had both a gradual rise in three directions with the growth in towing velocity 4 2 drag coefficient the drag coefficient of the subsea tree acquired by both numerical data and experimental data was plotted in fig 17 19 it can be seen that numerical data and numerical average are in accordance with the experimental data and experimental average in the drag coefficient in x y and z directions the average values of drag coefficient predicted by numerical method in x y and z directions are 0 466 0 458 and 0 434 respectively and the average values provided by experimental method in x y and z directions are 0 432 0 479 and 0 446 respectively the relative errors between experimental data and numerical data are 7 8 4 4 and 2 7 respectively therefore we can draw a conclusion from these comparisons that the proposed experimental method for the measurement of drag coefficient has a better measurement accuracy the error of drag coefficient in the experimental is small fig 17 19 demonstrate that the value of cd remains steady approximately as the towing velocity increases moreover it is apparent that the experiment data values are always well agree with the numerical data values through comparing experimental data with numerical data as a consequence the towing velocity slightly work on drag coefficient even not influencing the measurement of drag coefficient of the subsea tree inevitably part experimental data show a disagreement with numerical data such as velocity which are 0 3 m s and 0 4 m s in y direction and 0 1 m s and 0 4 m s in z direction the relative errors are 11 6 13 0 14 3 10 4 respectively which are all much greater than average the reason is that there is inevitable disturbance eg vibration due to the trailer during experiment and the disturbance can more affect the test results in the case of lower velocity hence the error at the lower velocities is generally larger than the average value 5 conclusion both the drag coefficient and

20237,the subsea tree acts as an important role in underwater production system during its installation procedure hydrodynamic loads significantly affect its dynamic performance hence the drag

cost high risk and difficult operations for instance locating the subsea facilities maintaining and clearing pipe routes due to the consumption of onshore oil and gas resources and the aim of guaranteeing the highly effective development performance to reduce cost and contribute to production offshore oil exploitation has been widely carried out in the past decades the subsea production systems have gradually become the mainstream mode for deep water gas and oil resources development li et al 2019 the underwater production system is widely applied for deep water gas and oil field such as liu hua oilfield wen et al 2019 and caspian sea project gable and amadeus 2019 underwater production system mainly includes subsea tree subsea manifold umbilical cable subsea control module subsea distribute unit and so on which are interconnected with production hong et al 2018 in the progress of installing and lowering subsea equipment the equipment usually is directly affected by harsh environment especially in the splash zone in the process of descent stage the interaction between wind wave and current has strong nonlinear coupling effect the loads on the equipment due to the wind wave and current may lead to its structure damage causing installation failure or even safety accidents and hence increase the cost on personnel and equipment s safety bhattacharyya and cheliyan 2019 thus it is very significant to predict the condition of installation of subsea equipment and attain relevant data and predict the dynamic response in installation stage comprehensive studies on prediction of dynamics responses of subsea equipment and the possibility of installation failure before the installation by means of different approaches can be found mao et al 2019 used improved volume of fluid method for forecasting a typical of behavior of an underwater structure during splash zone and comparison between experiment and numerical simulation shows a strong agreement liu et al 2015 put forward a mathematic model of manifold installation and the pipe and proposed the iterative method to solve those questions and applied orcaflex software to prove that the presented method had a good reliability and accuracy banks banks et al 2019 proposed the industrial standard about water content of subsea tree during commissioning period and made a good decision that was not dewatering the flowlines from 4 chooses in juniper development through reducing risks costs and simplifying the schedule the reliability and accuracy of hydrodynamic responses of underwater equipment were depended on hydrodynamic coefficient especially the drag coefficient therefore many researchers undertook lots of studies with different approaches for obtaining hydrodynamic coefficient of underwater equipment and other marine structure ehsan javanmard et al 2020 used a new computational fluid dynamics approach to calculate translational longitudinal and transverse added mass coefficients of an underwater vehicle comparisons are made with those obtained by previous methods and experiments and good agreement are achieved tian et al 2017a carried out the forced oscillation experiment and measured the hydrodynamic forces acting on the oscillating plat with different range of keulegan carpenter number by self designed experimental apparatus and the hydrodynamic coefficients were calculated using morison s equation tang et al 2018 undertook an array of net panel experiment in current in a flume channel to research the effect of different materials knot pattern and net solidity on the drag force and drag coefficient and proposed a formula to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficient of net panels in current martin et al tobiasmartin 2020 investigate following wake of screen and predicted the drag coefficient as a function of the screen solidity with relative turbulence intensity method balash et al 2009 analyzed the hydrodynamic force and mechanical stress acting on the net panel in flume channel and proposed a new formula to modify the original prediction of the drag coefficient of circular cylinder and sphere gu et al 2018 calculated the drag radiation damping and added mass of axisymmetric cylinder e g flat hemisphere and round base float on forced surge and heave motion using commercial software star ccm jin et al 2000 proposed the computational domain could be 6 7 times the size of the structures when simulating hydrodynamic coefficients qi et al 2020 studied on the resistance coefficient and added mass coefficient in the process of manifold deploying but it had low precision because of simplified model that plenty of pipes were simplified as cuboid which might lead to errors between simulated data and experimental data mansoorzadeh et al mansoorzadeh and javanmard 2014 measured the hydrodynamic coefficient of an autonomous subsea vehicle using numerical and experimental method only 1 5 m s and 2 5 m s however in spite of extensive researches of hydrodynamic coefficients in underwater production system such as the works mentioned above there is little on drag coefficient of three dimensional subsea equipment traditionally the hydrodynamic coefficients in ocean engineering were usually obtained via empirical formulas mavrakos 2004 pan et al 2012 rather than numerical simulation or experiment some researchers are studying on the relationship between the drag coefficient and marine structures aguilar et al 2019 avery et al 2019 orth and hendrix 2018 but not involving subsea tree its structure is shown in fig 1 the subsea tree directly affects the oil and gas production of the whole production system by controlling oil pressure and making progress regulatable wang et al 2018 as subsea tree works underwater for a long time it is subjected to hydrodynamic loads from whole production system and steady currents its structure will be scoured by current with different velocity and may experience the heave motion response which may threaten the system and staff consequently it is necessary to research the relationship between drag coefficient and velocity of subsea tree in summary only a few studies related to hydrodynamic coefficients of subsea tree have been performed in this paper the 1 10 scale model of subsea tree was investigated experimentally and numerically a series of model experiments that the velocity is changed from 0 1 to 1 3 m s were conducted to study the drag force and drag coefficient with increase of velocity meanwhile a numerical calculation was conducted in order to validate the results of experiment the comparison between experiment and numerical simulation proves reliability and accuracy of the experimental method further the experimental method in this paper can provide the accurate fundamental hydrodynamic data for underwater production system installation 2 numerical simulation for drag coefficient 2 1 governing equations in the section the reynolds averaged navier stokes equation with turbulence model were applied to simulating viscous flow around subsea tree more specifically turbulence model mainly had two types one is eddy viscosity turbulence model the other is reynold s stress turbulence model the reynolds stress model considers the anisotropy of turbulence and can usually give better results nonetheless the stability of numerical simulation is much less stable than the former model consequently the model of realizable k ε with the enhanced wall was chosen in the section the continuity equation for an incompressible fluid can be written as 1 u i x i 0 where i is general variable which can represent u v w which denote velocity of fluid in x y and z directions respectively navier stokes equation for incompressible fluid can be written as 2 ρ u t d i v ρ u u p x τ x x x τ y x y τ z x z f x ρ v t d i v ρ v v p y τ x y x τ y y y τ z y z f y ρ w t d i v ρ w w p z τ x z x τ y z y τ z z z f z the general form of governing equations can be written as 3 ρ i t ρ u i x ρ v i y ρ w i z x γ i x y γ i y z γ i z s where γ is generalized diffusion coefficient s is generalized source ρ is fluid density and μ is kinematic viscosity coefficient the turbulence model equations can be written as 4 ρ k t ρ k u x i x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k ρ ε ρ ε t ρ ε u x i x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j ρ c 1 e ε c 2 ρ ε 2 k ν ε where u represents the velocity vector of the fluid μ is the dynamic viscosity k denotes the turbulence kinetic energy and ϵ represents the turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rate model constants c2 1 9 σ k 1 0 σϵ 1 2 represent the c2 epsilon turbulent kinetic energy tke prandtl number and turbulent dissipation rate tdr prandtl number respectively x i and x j represent the position coordinate components g k is the production term of the tke caused by the average velocity gradient 2 2 subsea tree geometry the main dimensions of the model were 0 5325 m in length 0 3036 m in width and 0 3827 m in height which was shown in fig 3 and table 1 the projection areas in the x y and z directions were 0 1483 0 1890 and 0 2183 m2 respectively the air weight of the subsea tree model was approximately 10 2 kg in steady state averaging the forces during 15s measured by the every sensor f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 can be calculated as respectively 5 f i j m n f j n m 1 i 1 2 3 4 where f is the transient force measured by the sensors during 15s and n m 1 is the sampling amount which usually depends on the sampling frequency the total drag force can be described as 6 f d f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 cos θ 1 cos θ 2 where θ 1 is the average angle of four angles between the o x y plane and wire cable similarly θ 2 is average of four angles between x axis and the projection of wire cables on the o x y plane the design scheme of calculation on the total force of four points is shown in fig 2 similarly we can rotate the subsea tree for changing projection surface of which in towing tank and get the practical drag force of four points acting on the subsea tree in x y and z direction after adjusting the attitude of the subsea tree and which remains stable in the water trailer could be started to pull the model in a straight line for the reason that the motion between the water and subsea tree stays relative the water can be regarded as motionless and subsea tree keeps moving in one dimensional linear motion the drag coefficient c d of the subsea tree can be calculated as below 7 c d 2 f d ρ a v 2 where ρ represents density of the fluid a is the projection area v is the relative velocity between model and fluid and c d is the drag coefficient of model 2 3 computational domain and grid generation the model of the subsea tree and fluid domain were established the model was simplified because the actual subsea tree is too complex eg omitting the screw holes and bolts to promote the meshes generation and numerical computation in order to insure resemblance of hydrodynamic characteristics the shape of the simplified model is similar to actual model and the projected area has little change in x y and z direction in the numerical simulation a scale of 1 10 was chosen to establish the subsea tree model a rectangular block was established as fluid domain in order to promote the option of boundary condition which is illustrated in fig 4 the model of the subsea tree is placed at the center of the rectangular block i e the coordinate origin of subsea tree coincides with geometric center of fluid domain meanwhile x y and z axis in the global coordinate system are along the length width and height direction respectively in order to eliminate the effects of fluid domain boundary on numerical simulation it is necessary to ensure the boundary scale ratio of subsea tree and fluid domain not less than 5 1 tian et al 2017b in the study the dimensions of the fluid domain are 3 5 m long 3 5 m wide and 3 5 m high in order to satisfy both the accuracy and efficiency of numerical calculation a box was established to enclose the whole subsea tree in order to perform local grid refinement in the process of mesh generation 2 4 boundary conditions and numerical method based on the finite difference and other numerical method the below optimal condition of boundary was applied to the present numerical simulation in order to make progress of numerical simulation stable and save average calculating time the solver was adopted to the steady in this section realizable k ε model and wall function were adopted the kinematic viscosity and the density of incompressible fluid were set to be 1 308 10 6 m s and 1000 kg m3 respectively the type of inlet was adopted to the velocity inlet the type of outlet was adopted to the pressure outlet and the wall boundary with the no slip shear conditions as well as stationary wall motion were adopted to subsea tree and other wall boundaries a second order upwind was employed for turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent dissipation rate and a second order central difference scheme was used for the viscous and convective term an algorithm which was pressure implicit with splitting of operators was applied for coupling solution of pressure velocity taking the case of the velocity of 1 3 m s in x direction as an example fig 5 showed that the continuity and other indexes all had good convergence performance and the value were all below 10 4 which represented a high accuracy and stability of the numerical method the drag force was record when the residual was stable see fig 6 2 5 grid independence study for the grid independence study the predicted drag force of the subsea tree in the case of inlet velocity of 0 3 0 8 and 1 3 m s in the x direction was presented fig 7 and table 2 show that the drag force changed along with grid numbers the drag force was stable and accurate when the grid numbers is close to 10 million in the paper approximately 11230000 grid numbers were generated in the following numerical simulation to obtain numerical data which meant that obtained numerical results are grid independent in order to reach a good balance between computation time and calculation accuracy approach of hybrid grid was adopted in order to carry out the local grid refinement unstructured grid was adopted to subsea tree model and other parts were arranged for structure grid of the whole fluid domain the model mesh is illustrated in fig 8 the number of elements generated in computational grid was approximately 11230000 the value of y was 136 there were 10 prismatic layers whose relative dimension thickness was 3 3 mm and growth rate was 1 3 to cover boundary layer additionally the reason for preventing boundary layer s logarithmic region including the centroid of the wall adjacent cell which leads to the rough mesh selected to solve the laminar sublayer the law of the wall that enhance wall treatment was employed 2 6 uncertainty analysis as an uncertainty analysis the grid convergence index gci method was used to assess the capability of the proposed cfd model in solving the system of equations when sufficiently fine grid resolution is employed the gci that is known as an acceptable and recommended method for estimation of discretization error in cfd simulations procedure for estimation 2008 is based on richardson extrapolation re method javanmard et al 2019 for three sets of grids n1 n2 and n3 the grid refinement factors r 21 and r 32 are computed as r 21 h 2 h 1 and r 32 h 3 h 2 where h i is a representative grid size of the ith grid the apparent order of the method p is calculated by 8 p 1 ln r 21 ln ε 21 ε 32 q p 9 q p ln r 21 p s r 32 p s 10 s 1 sgn ε 32 ε 21 where ε 21 φ 2 φ 1 ε 32 φ 3 φ 2 and φ k is the key variable on the kh grid procedure for estimation 2008 javanmard et al 2019 the extrapolated values are obtained via 11 φ e x t 21 r 21 p φ 1 φ 2 r 21 p 1 the approximate and extrapolated relative errors are calculated using the following equations respectively 12 e a 21 φ 1 φ 2 φ 1 13 e e x t 21 φ e x t 21 φ 1 φ e x t 21 14 g c i f i n e 21 1 25 e a 21 r 21 p 1 for the three selected grids calculations of discretization error are presented in table 3 as can be seen numerical uncertainties for computed values were 0 309 and 0 051 respectively therefore regarding grid independence study and numerical uncertainties estimated from verification study it was concluded that the use 11230000 elements not only ensured that the results were grid independent but also was numerically cost effective 3 experimental setup in order to verify the predicted c d by star ccm the experiment was carried out in towing tank of zhejiang ocean university in china the towing tank is 130 m long 3 m wide and 3 5 m deep fig 9 shows the panorama of the tank see fig 10 the first stage is the test model manufacturing the subsea tree in practical engineering has complex geometry which consists of complex pipes slots and bolts the scale ratio is the key factor to determine the test model dimensions if the subsea tree model is too small it would cause lower accuracy of model test owing to the size effect on the contrary it will cause wall effect if the model is too large and wave reflection will be serious in the tank which leads to experimental errors and even worsens the test results in the research the 1 10 scale model of subsea tree was adopted comparing to practical structure in order to ensure the experimental model has the geometrical similarity to actual structure some accurate components such as resinous material steel plate and so on were adopted to control the geometrical shape of the subsea tree model the experimental model for the subsea tree is shown as fig 11 table 1 summarized the main parameters of subsea tree model every experimental apparatus is positioned in the tank which are shown as fig 12 the experimental system is mainly constituted of seven parts i e the towing tank trailer slideway the subsea tree model force sensor cable data acquisition device the trailer could move on the slideway in one dimensional linear motion whose maximum velocity is 3 m s and precision can reach 0 05 m s and the slideway was located on towing tank the subsea tree model was linked with wire cables buckles and any fastenings to the four points at symmetrical beams which locate the bottom of the trailer and four force sensors which are numbered sensor 1 to 4 were positioned at four wire cables respectively to keep a record of drag force acting on the four points of model additionally two g clips are located at each point aiming to increase the strength and stability in the process of test the turnbuckle which can adjust initial pre tightening force to keep the model horizontal in the water are also deployed at wire cables respectively during the model tests the bottom of subsea tree and tank bottom and the top of subsea tree and water surface are always keep a distance to reduce the extra force caused by shear flow or surface wave hence the drag force acting on subsea tree is closer to real situation the data acquiring from four force sensors was recorded and transmitted by the data acquisition device the transient force recorded by the force sensors was applied to eq 5 to calculate the f 1 f 2 f 3 and f 4 and the drag force can be obtained by eq 6 the precision of the force measurement is 0 01 n what s more the subsea tree was linked with the trailer platform by means of a safety rope in order to prevent the subsea tree falling off owing to the strength of the connection and other emergencies in the process of experiment the sketch of connection between the trailer and subsea tree model is presented at fig 13 in this study in order to obtain the drag force and drag coefficient of the subsea tree in three directions three groups of towing tests were carried out by approaches of experiment and numerical calculation respectively in order to reduce the unstable result caused by uncertainty of measurement 13 model experiments with diverse towing velocity were conducted in every direction furtherly the force was recorded through averaging the data obtained by tension sensor during 15s when the velocity stays in the steady state an increment is 0 1 m s by which velocity is changed from 0 1 to 1 3 m s and the precision of trailer then the drag force was obtained at each of the drag velocities 4 result and discussion 4 1 drag force by eq 7 the drag coefficients could be calculated at each of the drag velocities the averages of value of 13 drag coefficients were regarded as drag coefficients of the subsea tree in every direction simulated and measured drag force of the subsea tree in three directions are shown in fig 14 16 respectively meanwhile the fitted curves were both plotted by polynomial fitting it was obvious that the trend of numerical method was quite comparable to experimental method and the drag force had both a gradual rise in three directions with the growth in towing velocity 4 2 drag coefficient the drag coefficient of the subsea tree acquired by both numerical data and experimental data was plotted in fig 17 19 it can be seen that numerical data and numerical average are in accordance with the experimental data and experimental average in the drag coefficient in x y and z directions the average values of drag coefficient predicted by numerical method in x y and z directions are 0 466 0 458 and 0 434 respectively and the average values provided by experimental method in x y and z directions are 0 432 0 479 and 0 446 respectively the relative errors between experimental data and numerical data are 7 8 4 4 and 2 7 respectively therefore we can draw a conclusion from these comparisons that the proposed experimental method for the measurement of drag coefficient has a better measurement accuracy the error of drag coefficient in the experimental is small fig 17 19 demonstrate that the value of cd remains steady approximately as the towing velocity increases moreover it is apparent that the experiment data values are always well agree with the numerical data values through comparing experimental data with numerical data as a consequence the towing velocity slightly work on drag coefficient even not influencing the measurement of drag coefficient of the subsea tree inevitably part experimental data show a disagreement with numerical data such as velocity which are 0 3 m s and 0 4 m s in y direction and 0 1 m s and 0 4 m s in z direction the relative errors are 11 6 13 0 14 3 10 4 respectively which are all much greater than average the reason is that there is inevitable disturbance eg vibration due to the trailer during experiment and the disturbance can more affect the test results in the case of lower velocity hence the error at the lower velocities is generally larger than the average value 5 conclusion both the drag coefficient and the drag force of subsea tree are investigated by tests in a towing tank and numerical simulation based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes equation with turbulence model in the present paper comparisons between the experimental results and the numerical are made and they are generally in good agreement which indicates the proposed numerical and experimental methods can obtain the drag force and drag coefficient of the subsea tree accurately and reliably the model scale of the subsea tree is chosen as 1 10 for towing experiments both drag force and drag coefficient in the range from 0 1 m s to 1 3 m s are obtained accurately the three components of the drag force in x y and z directions obtained by experiments and numerical simulations gradually increase as the increase of velocity which shows a quadratic relation the drag coefficient however nearly remain constant in spite of a slight change which is 0 432 in x direction 0 479 in y direction and 0 446 in z direction the proposed experimental method and the adopted numerical approach in the present papery can be employed for studying the drag coefficient of other underwater structures and equipment such as subsea manifold suction pile plet pump station and they will be extended to forecast their motion responses which is our further work credit authorship contribution statement xu liang conceptualization

20238,numerical investigations on vortex induced vibration viv of a flexible cylinder with different length to diameter ratios named the aspect ratio l d ranging from 167 to 667 in an oscillatory flow have been conducted by the viv foam sjtu solver the solver is developed based on the open source toolbox openfoam and the two dimensional 2d strip theory hydrodynamic forces are calculated through the pimple algorithm in each 2d fluid strip the finite element method fem combined with the newmark β method are used to calculate vibrations of the flexible cylinder in both crossflow and inline directions the cylinder model is pinned at both ends with top and bottom support frames forced to harmonically oscillate in the inline direction which contributes to the generation of a relative oscillatory flow between the still water and the flexible cylinder mesh and fluid strip convergence studies are conducted to choose the appropriate computational model for subsequent simulations simulation results and experiment results are in good agreement that verifies the validity of the solver comparisons among simulations with different aspect ratios are analyzed detailedly the maximum vibration amplitude the dominant vibration mode and the non dimensional dominant vibration frequency in both directions are enlarged apparently with the increase of the cylinder aspect ratio the typical vibration trajectory changes from the butterfly type to the stripe type with l d increases keywords vortex induced vibration viv foam sjtu solver oscillatory flow aspect ratio 1 introduction when the viscous flow with a certain velocity goes through a circular cylinder vortices will be generated on the cylinder surface and then shed behind the cylinder the asymmetric vortex shedding contributes to the fluctuated lift force in the cross flow direction which then leads to the viv phenomenon when the vortex shedding frequency approaches around the cylinder natural frequency the resonance phenomenon happens and the vibration amplitude will be amplified obviously in deep sea oil and gas exploitation viv of the marine riser is one of the main sources resulting in the fatigue damage during the past decades viv features of a single cylinder had been studied extensively by researchers such as williamson and govardhan 2004 sarpkaya 2004 huang et al 2009 ji et al 2015 chen et al 2016 and wan and duan 2017 in order to predict viv response of the deep sea riser the 2d strip method was proposed by willden and graham 2001 2004 and benchmark simulations were conducted to verify its validity meanwhile the multi modes vibration phenomenon was observed when the cylinder aspect ratio was extremely large yamamoto et al 2004 and sun et al 2012 also adopted this method to carry out viv researches simulation results were in good agreement with published data and experiment results which further verified the validity of the strip method researches on viv of a flexible cylinder in the oscillatory flow are comparatively fewer than that in the steady flows the relative oscillatory flow is generated between the marine riser and the water due to the periodical top end oscillation of the riser connected to the floating platform which results from the effects of winds waves and currents in the ocean environment the complexity of the oscillatory flow leads to different viv responses of the cylinder from that in the steady flow therefore viv of a rigid cylinder in oscillatory flow was studied firstly to capture its vibration and vortex shedding features williamson 1985 and sarpkaya 1986 conducted experiments on viv of a rigid cylinder in the relative oscillatory flow systematically and representative vortex shedding regimes were identified within a particular range of keulegan carpenter kc numbers bearman 1989 studied the effects of kc numbers and stokes numbers through the experimental method while different vortex shedding regimes were observed too in order to deeply understand the vibration responses sumer and fredsøe 1988 carried out experiments on transverse vibration of a rigid cylinder exposed to the oscillatory flow with kc numbers ranging from 5 to 100 kozakiewicz et al 1997 and zhao et al 2012 carried out experiments and numerical simulations on viv of a fixed and a freely vibrating circular cylinder in relative oscillatory flow with different reduced velocities at kc 10 and 20 respectively they found that the vortex shedding direction and wake structures changed apparently due to the crossflow vibration of the cylinder zhao et al 2012 also concluded that the reduced velocity presented significant effects on the xy trajectory mode of the cylinder and the maximum crossflow vibration amplitude was comparatively smaller than that in the inline direction when the reduced velocity was extremely large further zhao et al 2013a 2013b carried out simulations on viv of a cylinder with one dof degree of freedom and two dofs experiencing the oscillatory flow and the mixed flow respectively nehari et al 2004 concentrated on the numerical method effects to viv response of a circular cylinder between three dimensional 3d and two dimensional 2d models scandura et al 2009 investigated vorticity dynamics and forces induced by the oscillatory flow over a circular cylinder adopting the direct numerical simulation dns method zhao and cheng 2014 also conducted researches on vortex shedding regimes of two circular cylinders in tandem and side by side arrangements using 2d model effects of kc numbers and gap ratios between two cylinders were mainly investigated tong et al 2015 focused on flow patterns of four cylinders in square arrangement exposed to the oscillatory flow under low kc numbers and reynolds re numbers flow patterns were classified based on the known flow regimes around a single cylinder pearcey et al 2017 performed 2d investigations on transverse vibration of two rigid connected cylinders with different diameter at kc 10 orientation and gap effects were mainly studied varying from the tandem arrangement to the side by side arrangement the specific intermittent switch among different vortex regimes was observed munir et al 2018 carried out 2d numerical simulations considering the plane boundary effects simulations were conducted at kc 5 and 10 with the reduced velocities varied from 1 to 15 while four gap ratios between the cylinder and the plane were mainly investigated it was found that the plane boundary played significant effects in the crossflow vibration response of the cylinder non vortex shedding regime was observed at large reduced velocity at kc 10 resulting from absorption effects of shear layers generated from the plane boundary to vortices meanwhile fonias and grigoriadis 2018 also carried out similar researches using the 3d simulation model they found that the suppression of the boundary layer separation phenomenon would happen when the gap ratio was smaller than 0 05 nevertheless viv of a long flexible cylinder showed quite different vibration characteristics resulting from the axial deformation fu et al 2013 and wang et al 2014 carried out experiments on viv of a flexible cylinder in the oscillatory flow at kc 178 and 84 respectively the specific building up lock in dying out viv developing process was proposed effects of the oscillating period on viv features were studied furthermore wang et al 2015 studied the fatigue damage induced by viv in the oscillatory flow adopting an empirical viv predicting model thorsen et al 2016 and yuan et al 2018 also proposed semi empirical models to predict viv response in the oscillatory flow based on experiments of wang et al 2014 fu et al 2018 carried out numerical simulations at the same condition and compared with experiment results detailedly ren et al 2019 carried out experiments on viv of a flexible cylinder fitted with helical strakes in the oscillatory flow with kc numbers varying from 21 to 165 effects on viv suppression features from the helical strakes are mainly studied however most previous researches mainly concentrated on comparatively low aspect ratio which was smaller than 200 actually viv of a flexible cylinder with large aspect ratio shows more complicated characteristics such as extreme high vibration mode the travelling wave phenomenon multi modes vibration and etc lie and kaasen 2006 carried out experiments of a large scale cylinder in the sheared flow with the aspect ratio reached 3000 the maximum 29th vibration mode and the obvious travelling wave phenomenon along the cylinder span were observed xu et al 2008 adopted the wake oscillator model to study viv of a flexible cylinder with high aspect ratio in uniform and sheared flows they found that nonlinear effects become more significant with the increase of the cylinder aspect ratio duan et al 2017 also studied viv responses in uniform and sheared flow conditions with the cylinder aspect ratio ranging from 500 to 1000 they found that the multi modes vibration phenomenon become more obvious especially at high aspect ratios although abundant researches of a large scale flexible cylinder in steady flow conditions had been conducted using both experimental and numerical methods studies on viv in the oscillatory flow with similar cylinder model were limited hence effects of the cylinder aspect ratio to viv responses in the oscillatory flow are mainly studied in this paper using the viv foam sjtu solver based on experiments of fu et al 2013 and simulations of fu et al 2018 the cylinder aspect ratio varies from 167 to 667 particular variations on the mode transition phenomenon in the half oscillatory period and vibration trajectories along the cylinder are analyzed this paper is organized as followed the numerical method used in this paper is introduced in section 2 followed by validation studies in section 3 including the mesh convergence study the fluid strip number convergence study and the verification study of the solver simulation results and corresponding discussions are presented in section 4 finally section 5 gives a brief summary 2 numerical method 2 1 problem description in this paper the fundamental simulation is carried out referring to experiments of fu et al 2013 the layout of model experiments is shown in fig 1 the water keeps still and support frames at both ends of the horizontal flexible cylinder are forced to oscillate in the inline direction x direction while the cylinder is allowed to freely vibrate in the crossflow direction y direction main parameters of the cylinder model are listed in table 1 the periodical oscillation of support frames can be expressed as eq 1 and eq 2 1 a t a m sin 2 π t t 2 u t 2 π a m t cos 2 π t t u m cos 2 π t t where a is the oscillating amplitude at time t a m is the maximum oscillating amplitude t is the oscillating period u is the oscillating velocity at time t u m is the maximum oscillating velocity of support frames the relative oscillatory flow between the still water and the oscillating cylinder can be represented by the kc number which denotes the connection between the maximum oscillating amplitude and the diameter of the flexible cylinder as shown in eq 3 3 k c 2 π a m d where d is the diameter of the cylinder 2 2 two dimensional strip theory for a flexible cylinder with large aspect ratio the direct numerical simulation of the 3d fluid field will cost super abundant computational resources and time in order to solve this problem willden and graham 2001 2004 put forward the 2d strip method in predicting viv responses of long flexible cylinders this method simplifies the 3d fluid field into several 2d fluid strips equally distributed along the cylinder span hydrodynamic forces are calculated in each 2d strip which then are applied to structural elements after the computation of vibrations nodal displacements are interpolated to the corresponding fluid strips to update the dynamic mesh and then start the next cycle of computation the schematic diagram of the 2d strip method is shown in fig 2 this method is very appropriate for solving fluid and structure interaction fsi problems with supramaximal computation domain it owns high computational efficiency and the computational accuracy is reliable comparing with dns method which has been verified through previous researches such as meneghini et al 2004 and yamamoto et al 2004 in present study all simulations are carried out using the viv foam sjtu solver which is developed based on the open source toolbox openfoam and the 2d strip method hydrodynamic forces acted on the cylinder are computed from viscous forces and pressure forces using the pimple algorithm in the openfoam integrated over the surface of the cylinder in each fluid strip the connection among all fluid strips is achieved through the inline and crossflow vibrations of the cylinder calculated from the structural field using the fem method with the newmark β algorithm the reliability of the solver in predicting viv responses in steady flows has been verified by duan et al 2016a where the benchmark simulation results have been compared with the experiment results in detail employing this solver duan et al 2016b 2018 and wang et al 2019 have conducted abundant numerical investigations on viv of a single flexible cylinder in uniform sheared and stepped flows respectively 2 3 hydrodynamic governing equations in order to obtain viv responses hydrodynamic forces in both directions should be calculated first during the simulation the flow field is supposed to be incompressible with constant dynamic viscosity μ and constant density ρ reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans are chosen as hydrodynamic governing equations expressed in eq 4 and eq 5 the sst k ω turbulence model is used to compute the reynolds stress and no wall functions are used in present study fu et al 2018 and zhao 2013 also adopted the same numerical methods to investigate viv responses of a flexible and a circular cylinder experiencing an oscillatory flow respectively and verified its reliability 4 u

can be considered as a flexural elastic structure satisfying the bernoulli euler bending beam hypothesis thus the cylinder vibrations are calculated through this model and the fem method in this paper the support excitation method that has been verified available in solving structural vibrations of a flexible cylinder with large scale motions by fu et al 2018 is used in present study the inline displacement x direction can be written as the sum of the support frame motion and the relative inline vibration of the cylinder shown as eq 14 14 x t o t a l z t x f r a m e t x z t where x t o t a l z t is the total inline displacement of all nodes along the cylinder x f r a m e t is the support frame displacement at both ends x z t is the relative inline vibration displacement the equilibrium of force components in the system can be expressed as eq 15 15 f h y d r o f i n e r t i a l f d a m p i n g f s p r i n g where f h y d r o is the hydrodynamic force acted on the cylinder f i n e r t i a l is the inertial force calculated through the kinetic energy of the cylinder f d a m p i n g is the damping force calculated through the damping and the vibration velocity of the cylinder f s p r i n g is the spring force calculated through the stiffness and the vibration displacement of the cylinder then the mass spring damping mck equations of the system in both directions can be written as eq 16 and eq 17 16 m x c x k x f h y d r o x m x f r a m e 17 m y c y k y f h y d r o y where m c k are the mass the damping and the stiffness of the system f h y d r o x f h y d r o y are the inline and the crossflow hydrodynamic forces respectively through the fem method the governing equations of the system can be expressed as eq 18 and eq 19 18 m x c x k x f hx m x frame 19 m y c y k y f hy where m c k are the mass damping and stiffness matrixes of the system x frame is the acceleration vector of the support frame in the in line direction f hx f hy are hydrodynamic force vectors in both directions the rayleigh damping is used to generate the damping matrix as shown in eq 20 and eq 21 based on the first two natural frequencies of the cylinder listed in table 1 20 c α m β k 21 α β 2 ς f n 1 f n 2 2 π f n 1 f n 2 1 2 π where α and β are proportionality coefficient ς is the damping ratio f n 1 and f n 2 are the first two natural frequencies of the cylinder 3 validation studies 3 1 numerical model setup the 2d strip theory requires calculating hydrodynamic forces in multiple 2d fluid planes located at intervals along the cylinder span therefore a suitable choice of the fluid strip number and the mesh resolution is benefit for the well capture of the highest vibration mode and the prediction of hydrodynamic forces through researches of willden and graham 2001 2004 they found that a minimum of three fluid strips were required per vibration mode for correct capture on the axial variation of the phasing of the hydrodynamic forces with respect to the cylinder vibration during their simulations 64 fluid strips were used with the maximum vibration mode reached around the 10th mode considering the dominant vibration mode in the experiment of fu et al 2013 kept the 1st mode at kc 178 20 fluid strips are sufficient to capture the 1st mode in the validation study the layout of the computational model is shown in fig 3 all strips share the same computational domain and mesh distribution velocity inlet condition is specified at the inlet boundary and pressure outlet condition is applied in the outlet boundary wall condition is specified at the cylinder surface boundary while symmetry conditions are for the top and bottom boundaries on account of the finite volume method used in the openfoam the 3d computational grid is required during the flow field calculation therefore the empty condition which represents the neglect of numerical simulation in the axial direction z direction specified at the front and back boundaries realizes the generation of the 2d computational grid as shown in fig 4 a the dynamic mesh technique is used to update the computational mesh at every time step since the kc number is set to be 178 in all simulations the oscillating amplitude of support frames in the inline direction is extremely large compared with the crossflow vibration amplitude in order to guarantee the mesh quality during simulations each fluid strip is 180d in the inline direction and 40d in the crossflow direction mesh near the cylinder surface is refined and the y keeps around 2 0 in all simulations to predict turbulence kinetic energy in the boundary layer as shown in fig 4 b the updated mesh is shown in fig 4 c and d when support frames oscillate to its leftmost position it can be found that the computational mesh of the left part has been compressed while the right part has been stretched obviously however the mesh around the cylinder surface almost keeps the same as that at the initial condition in the circular domain which guarantees the mesh quality and minimizes the effect of mesh deformation during the hydrodynamic forces calculation the flexible cylinder is discretized into 80 structural elements with 81 nodes in total the time step is set as 0 0002s to ensure the courant number lower than 2 0 during the implicit solution process which guarantees the stability and the convergence rate in all simulations in order to analyze the vibration frequency features the modal analysis method that has been testified to be valid by chaplin et al 2005 and fu et al 2018 is adopted thus displacements in the crossflow and the inline directions can be expressed as the sum of a series of modal shapes as followed 22 ϕ m z sin m π l z 23 x z t m 1 n u m t ϕ m z 24 y z t m 1 n v m t ϕ m z where z is the axial location of the structural nodes l is the cylinder length m 1 2 3 and etc x z t is the relative inline displacement of all nodes along the cylinder y z t is the crossflow displacement of all nodes u m t is the time dependent modal weight vector of the mth mode in the inline direction v m t is the time dependent modal weight vector of the mth mode in the crossflow direction and n is the mode number then figures of modal decomposition and power spectral density psd of each modal weight normalized by the cylinder diameter d are obtained 3 2 mesh convergence study computational mesh convergence study is conducted among three meshes with 0 45 million 0 8 million and 1 4 million cells to verify the mesh dependence magnitudes of the crossflow and inline vibration responses are provided by the standard deviations std with respect to time of the std of y z t and x z t over z as expressed in eq 25 and 26 std of modal weights σ v m and σ u m are defined in the same way the natural frequencies f n m the mth order of the natural frequency of the cylinder are normalized by the strouhal frequency as shown in eq 27 25 σ y 1 t 0 t 1 l 0 l y z t 2 d z d t 26 σ x 1 t 0 t 1 l 0 l x z t x z 2 d z d t 27 f s u m s t d where x z is the time averaged inline displacement t is the time interval for data processing st 0 2 is the strouhal number used in present analysis fig 5 shows comparison of vibration displacements std along the cylinder in both directions which presents the 1st modal shape among different mesh resolutions relatively obvious computational errors can be observed between the coarse mesh and the medium mesh of the maximum crossflow displacement std and its corresponding axial location meanwhile good agreement is obtained among three meshes in the inline direction fig 6 shows comparison of non dimensional vibration modal weights std versus non dimensional natural frequencies among three mesh resolutions the peak vibration mode in each fold line represents the dominant vibration mode of the cylinder the cylinder shows the 1st vibration mode where the corresponding non dimensional frequency is around 1 in both directions indicating the occurrence of the resonance phenomenon effects of other vibration modes are too small to be considered it can be known that the dominant vibration mode and the corresponding modal weight amplitude agree well between the medium mesh and the fine mesh while computational errors exist between the medium mesh and the coarse mesh in both directions therefore the medium mesh with 0 8 million cells is employed for further investigations based on the mesh resolution convergence study 3 3 fluid strips convergence study the fluid strips convergence study among 10 strips 20 strips and 40 strips respectively is carried out at l d 167 fig 7 and fig 8 are comparisons of std of vibration displacements and modal weights in both directions from these figures it can be found that good agreement of the maximum vibration displacement std and its corresponding axial location can be obtained between the 20 fluid strips simulation and the 40 fluid strips simulation in both directions comparatively large computation error is observed from 10 fluid strips simulation in the crossflow direction where both the maximum vibration displacement std and its axial location are overestimated the 1st dominant vibration mode is correctly captured in both directions among three simulations from modal weights std variation tendency from the 2nd vibration mode to the 6th vibration mode shows high degree of similarity with the same magnitude meanwhile comparisons on viv responses of a flexible cylinder with larger aspect ratio between 20 fluid strips and 40 fluid strips at the same conditions are also conducted fig 9 shows corresponding modal weights std in both directions it can be found that the variation tendency shows high similarity especially at l d 333 and 500 in both directions although comparatively large computational errors appear at the 1st vibration mode in both directions when the aspect ratio reaches 667 dominant vibration modes are correctly captured with the same magnitude using different number of fluid strips it can be concluded that 20 fluid strips can capture main vibration characteristics well with comparatively fewer computational meshes and computational time in present study 3 4 numerical validation study comparison of the viv developing process in half an oscillating period between previous experiment and present simulation is presented in fig 10 to analyze viv responses in the half oscillatory flow three specific regions of building up lock in and dying out are defined based on the boundary value of 2 a m 2 d by fu et al 2013 the definition of the special lock in region in the viv developing process represents the drastic viv with comparatively large vibration displacement in each half period which is different from the normal concept of the resonance phenomenon where the vortex shedding frequency closes to the natural frequency of the cylinder the lock in region is 17 3 of the half oscillating period in the present simulation from fig 10 b which agrees well with the experiment result of 17 from fig 10 a of fu et al 2013 the maximum non dimensional crossflow vibration amplitude in present simulation is larger than the experiment which may result from the simplification of the practical damping replaced by the rayleigh damping comparisons of more vibration responses are shown in fig 11 fig 11 a shows viv responses from experiments of fu et al 2013 it can be found that the specific intermittent viv feature is observed during multiple oscillating periods the dominant vibration mode presents the 1st vibration mode and the dominant vibration frequency is around 2 1hz and effects of the 2nd vibration mode to viv responses are extremely weak in contrast to the 1st vibration mode fig 11 b to fig 11 d are simulation results of the non dimensional time dependent crossflow displacement at the mid span cylinder non dimensional time dependent modal weights and the corresponding modal psd respectively fig 11 b also presents the same intermittent viv phenomenon as the experiment with the maximum vibration amplitude shows a bit larger than that of experiment the dominant vibration mode of the cylinder shows the 1st vibration mode from the modal weight comparison in fig 11 c values of the 2nd the 3rd and the 4th modal weights are extremely smaller than that of the 1st vibration mode which is also familiar with experiment results in fig 11 a the vibration frequency region in multiple oscillating periods varies from around 1 9hz 2 7hz showing in fig 11 d which is in good agreement with the frequency analysis result in the third subplot from fig 11 a the dominant vibration frequency corresponding to the 1st dominant vibration mode is around 2 0hz in present simulation from the peak value in fig 11 d which closes to the experiment result of 2 1hz from fu et al 2013 from these comparisons it can be known that simulation results are in good agreement with experiment results and the validity of the solver is verified 4 results and discussions 4 1 time domain vibration responses comparisons of nodal vibration responses from numerical simulations of a flexible cylinder with different aspect ratios in an oscillatory flow are analyzed detailedly in this section almost all parameters of these numerical models keep the same as the fundamental simulation except that the cylinder axial length varies from 8 to 16 with an interval of 4 it means that cylinder aspect ratios are 167 333 500 and 667 respectively in the following analysis fig 12 presents non dimensional crossflow vibration displacements at 9 locations along the cylinder in multiple oscillating periods vibration displacement of support frames gets to zero when t i 0 or 0 5 t i 0 1 2 etc t 16 5s as presented in eq 1 while the corresponding relative oscillatory flow velocity gets its maximum value while the relative velocity will approach zero when vibration displacement of support frames gets to its peaks and valleys at t i 0 25 t and i 0 75 t respectively the specific lock in region defined by fu et al 2013 occurs at around t 2 5t and 3 0t in fig 12 a when the frame velocity gets its maximum value the maximum vibration amplitude at the mid span cylinder is around 0 5d in the lock in region when l d 167 while it decreases to around 0 1d at locations of z l 0 1 and 0 9 the vibration amplitude shows the same magnitude in building up and dying out regions where viv responses are comparatively weaker than that in the lock in region when the cylinder aspect ratio increases to 333 the maximum non dimensional crossflow vibration amplitude increases to around 0 8 around the mid span cylinder as shown in fig 13 b the vibration amplitude at z l 0 1 and 0 9 increases to around 0 3d which is three times of that at l d 167 the vibration amplitude variation among all locations along the cylinder at l d 333 shows similar tendency as that at l d 167 the maximum non dimensional crossflow vibration amplitude at locations of z l 0 2 and 0 8 increases to around 0 8 in the lock in region when the cylinder aspect ratio reaches 500 as shown in fig 12 c meanwhile the maximum vibration amplitude at the mid span cylinder decreases to around 0 5d the vibration amplitude variation tendency at l d 500 is opposite to that at l d 167 and 333 no apparent increase of the vibration amplitude appears in building up and dying out regions due to the weak viv responses of the cylinder in these regions where the oscillating velocities are close to zero the non dimensional crossflow vibration amplitude is around 0 8 at nodes of z l 0 2 and 0 8 when the cylinder aspect ratio reaches 667 while the vibration amplitude increases to around 0 7d at the mid span cylinder compared with that at l d 500 it can be found that the specific intermittent viv developing process varies obviously with the increase of the cylinder aspect ratio compared between fig 12 a and d non dimensional inline displacements along the cylinder span in multiple oscillating periods are presented in fig 13 the maximum relative non dimensional inline vibration amplitude increases from around 0 25 to 5 0 with the increase of the cylinder aspect ratio since the oscillation of support frames shows a sinusoidal function shape as expressed in eq 1 the relative oscillatory flow u w can be written as followed 28 u w t u m cos 2 π t t it is obvious that the relative oscillatory flow velocity and the relative inline displacement are synchronous it can be found in fig 13 a that the maximum relative non dimensional inline vibration displacement around its inline equilibrium position gets to its maximum value at t i 0 or 0 5 t i 0 1 2 etc where the support frames move across the original position and the corresponding oscillating velocity gets to its maximum the vibration amplitude gets its maximum value at the mid span cylinder during all simulations which is very different from the crossflow variation tendency at high aspect ratios compared between figs 13 d and fig 12 d where the dominant inline vibration mode keeps the 1st mode and the dominant crossflow vibration mode increase to the 2nd and 3rd modes a high frequency vibration phenomenon is observed at the rightmost or the leftmost positions during the oscillation of support frames the source of the special phenomenon may result from the reattachment effects of existing vortices shed during the previous half oscillating period which has been detailed explained in simulation of fu et al 2018 when the cylinder aspect ratio gets larger this high vibration frequency phenomenon turns to happen mainly in the lock in region another significant finding is that an inflection point is observed at t 0 25 or 0 75 i t i 0 1 2 etc in building up and dying out regions when support frames approach its rightmost or leftmost positions non dimensional crossflow spatio temporal displacements and typical vibration deflections along the cylinder are shown in fig 14 and fig 15 where the red to blue color bar represents the magnitude of the crossflow vibration displacement crossflow vibration of all nodes is in phase from the spatio temporal displacement along the cylinder in fig 14 a it can be known that the cylinder presents the 1st dominant vibration mode which corresponds to the typical crossflow vibration deflection in fig 15 a crossflow vibrations of upper and nether nodes transfers from in phase vibration to anti phase vibration when the cylinder aspect ratio increases to 333 which contributes to the vibration shape transition phenomenon from the 1st mode shape to the 2nd mode shape around the lock in region as shown in figs 14 b and fig 15 b the travelling wave phenomenon along the cylinder span can be observed between two standing wave phenomena the 1st modal standing wave occurred in the lock in region with larger vibration amplitude than that of the 2nd modal standing wave which can be observed through the gradation of the red or blue color combining fig 12 c with figs 14 c and fig 15 c the vibration shape transition phenomenon of the 1st modal standing wave travelling wave 2nd modal standing wave developing process is also observed the main difference between l d 333 and l d 500 is that the 2nd vibration shape is occurred and becomes the dominant vibration shape in the lock in region the 1st vibration shape mainly occurs in building up and dying out regions the variation on the dominant vibration shape corresponds to the variation shown in fig 12 at l d 500 the vibration deflection increases to the 2nd and the 3rd mode shapes when l d 667 the 3rd modal standing wave is observed in the lock in region and the 2nd modal standing wave is observed in building up and dying out regions while the vibration shape transition phenomenon occurs between them the vibration deflection changes from single mode to multi modes under the effect of the cylinder aspect ratio the dominant vibration deflection increases from the 1st vibration shape to the 3rd vibration shape in the lock in region with the cylinder aspect ratio increases as shown in fig 15 the vibration shape transition phenomenon of the standing wave travelling wave standing wave developing process can be observed clearly when the cylinder aspect ratio is larger than 333 as shown in figs 14 and 15 the travelling wave phenomenon can only be observed during each viv developing process when the viv regions change from the building up region to the lock in region or from the lock in region to the dying out region where the relative oscillatory flow velocity changes obviously as shown in fig 14 b c and d comparison of displacements std along the cylinder in both directions present in fig 16 it can be found that the maximum non dimensional displacement std increases from 0 15 at the mid span cylinder to 0 35 at z l 0 2 and 0 8 which are in good agreement with the crossflow vibration variation tendency in fig 12 the vibration shape along the cylinder span increases from the 1st mode shape to the 3rd mode shape when l d increases from 167 to 667 the maximum non dimensional inline displacement std increases from 0 2 to 3 05 as shown in fig 16 b with the increase of the cylinder aspect ratio however the vibration deflection keeps the 1st mode shape in all simulations which corresponds with the sinusoidal shape of the time dependent inline vibration displacements as shown in fig 13 it represents that the 1st mode plays remarkable controlling effect to the inline vibration responses of the cylinder 4 2 modal and frequency domain responses comparison of modal weights and corresponding modal psd of the cylinder in the crossflow and inline directions are presented in fig 17 and fig 18 respectively the modal psd is normalized by the 1st natural frequency f n l d 1 of the cylinder the first two order natural frequencies of the cylinder among different aspect ratios are shown in table 2 it can be found that the dominant vibration mode of the cylinder at l d 167 is apparently the 1st vibration mode from fig 17 a effects of higher vibration modes are too small to be considered multi frequency components are observed in the modal psd variation on the oscillating velocity leads to the variation of the re number and vortex shedding features in each half oscillating period two frequency peaks in the modal psd of fig 17 a correspond to vibration frequencies in each lock in region during the viv developing process in an oscillating period lower frequency components in the modal psd represent corresponding vibration frequencies in building up and dying out regions when l d 333 as shown in fig 17 b the dominant vibration mode keeps the 1st vibration mode as l d 167 the dominant vibration frequency in the lock in region is around 1 4 f n l d 333 1 although effects of the 2nd vibration mode become obvious at l d 333 it is still covered by the 1st vibration mode during most time the dominant vibration mode will turn to the 2nd vibration mode only when the modal weight amplitude of the 2nd vibration mode exceeds the 1st vibration mode during the viv developing process such as at the time region from t 33s to t 35s as shown in the time dependent modal weights in fig 17 b therefore the mode transition phenomenon can hardly be observed however this phenomenon becomes more obvious when l d 500 the dominant vibration mode increases to the 2nd vibration mode with the corresponding dominant vibration frequency reaches around 2 2 f n l d 500 1 obvious modal weights of the 3rd and the 4th vibration modes whose effects to viv responses are totally covered by the 2nd vibration mode are also observed in fig 17 c multi dominant vibration modes phenomenon is generated when the aspect ratio increases to 667 as shown in fig 17 d since modal weight magnitudes of the 2nd and the 3rd vibration modes are very similar in the lock in region the dominant vibration mode will shift between these modes and vibration features will become more complicated corresponding dominant vibration frequencies are around 2 4 f n l d 667 1 and 3 0 f n l d 667 1 respectively it can be concluded that the dominant crossflow vibration mode will increase and the multi mode vibration phenomenon will appear with the increase of the cylinder aspect ratio although the non dimensional frequencies present a decrease tendency with the increase of the cylinder aspect ratio the actual dominant vibration frequencies still keep around 2 0hz due to the decrease of the natural frequencies the time dependent relative inline vibration shape of all nodes performs similar sinusoidal function shape as shown in fig 13 which contributes to the dominant 1st vibration mode in all simulations effects of higher vibration modes are totally covered due to the extremely large modal weight of the 1st vibration mode in order to analyze modal vibration characteristics in the inline direction the controlling effect of the 1st vibration mode on modal weights and corresponding modal psd is removed as presented in fig 18 the high order of vibration mode increases from the 2nd vibration mode to the 5th vibration mode at an interval of 1 with the increase of the cylinder aspect ratio the corresponding vibration frequency at l d 167 is around 2 0 f n l d 167 1 and it increases to around 3 3 f n l d 333 1 4 6 f n l d 500 1 and 5 8 f n l d 667 1 respectively when the cylinder aspect ratio increases from 333 to 667 high order vibration frequencies in the inline direction are around twice of dominant vibration frequencies in the crossflow direction at the same aspect ratio compared between figs 17 and 18 although more high order vibration modes are excited almost only one dominant vibration mode appears when removing the 1st dominant vibration mode in the inline direction observing from the time dependent modal weights it can also be found that multi modes vibration phenomenon appears when the aspect ratio increase to 500 as shown in fig 18 c which is similar to the phenomenon that observed in the crossflow direction as shown in fig 17 4 3 vibration trajectories in order to illustrate the relationship between the crossflow and the inline vibrations more directly vibration trajectories at 9 axial locations from z l 0 1 to 0 9 along the cylinder in an oscillating period are presented in fig 19 the obvious butterfly type of vibration trajectory can be observed at all locations when l d 167 and the butterfly shape at the mid span cylinder is larger than that at other locations which corresponds to the variation tendency of vibration displacements in figs 12 and 13 two sides of the butterfly trajectory are generated in the lock in region where crossflow and inline vibration amplitudes approach its maximum values at the same time the vibration amplitude decreases apparently in both directions when the vibration locates in building up and dying out regions which contributes to the generation of the middle part of the butterfly vibration trajectory when the aspect ratio reaches 333 the increase rate of the vibration amplitude in the inline direction is larger than that in the crossflow direction which leads to the comparatively large enlargement of the butterfly type of vibration trajectory in the inline direction as shown in fig 19 b meanwhile vibration shapes at all nodes keep the butterfly type due to the dominant 1st vibration modes in both directions since the dominant vibration mode transfers to the 2nd vibration mode in the crossflow direction and keeps the 1st vibration mode in the inline direction in the lock in region at l d 500 the butterfly type of vibration trajectory changes to the stripe type especially at the mid span cylinder as shown in fig 19 c the butterfly shape can still be observed at upper and nether nodes along the cylinder which is similar to that in fig 19 b the slenderness of the strip type of vibration trajectory increases when the cylinder aspect ratio increases to 667 the butterfly type of vibration trajectory gradually disappears on account of the appearance of the 3rd vibration mode in the lock in region from comparisons of vibration trajectories it can be found that the vibration trajectory shape turns from the butterfly type to the stripe type with the increase of the cylinder aspect ratio however axial locations near both ends of the cylinder hardly be affected and keep the butterfly type of vibration trajectory 5 conclusions a series of numerical investigations on viv of a flexible cylinder in an oscillatory flow with different aspect ratios have been conducted in this paper using the viv foam sjtu solver the fundamental simulation is based on experiments of fu et al 2013 at kc 178 simulation results have been compared and analyzed detailedly the specific building up lock in dying out viv developing process is also observed in present study in order to exclude disturbances from the mesh resolution and the number of fluid strips computational mesh and fluid strips convergence studies have been carried out the medium mesh with 0 8 million cells and 20 fluid strips has been chosen for subsequent simulations in the crossflow direction the dominant vibration mode increases from the 1st vibration mode to the 3rd vibration mode with the increase of the cylinder aspect ratio the maximum vibration amplitude increases remarkably when the aspect ratio increase from 167 to 500 the vibration amplitude decreases to around 0 7d and the multi modes vibration phenomenon appears when the aspect ratio reaches 667 in the inline direction the dominant vibration mode keeps the 1st vibration mode and the maximum vibration amplitude keeps increasing from around 0 25d to 5 0d the normalized dominant vibration frequency varies from 0 75 f n l d 167 1 to 3 0 f n l d 667 1 in the crossflow direction and from 2 0 f n l d 167 1 to 5 8 f n l d 667 1 in the inline direction as for the vibration trajectory it changes from the butterfly shape to the slender stripe shape when the cylinder aspect ratio increases while it keeps the butterfly shape at locations near both ends of the cylinder in

20238,numerical investigations on vortex induced vibration viv of a flexible cylinder with different length to diameter ratios named the aspect ratio l d ranging from 167 to 667 in an oscillatory flow have been conducted by the viv foam sjtu solver the solver is developed based on the open source toolbox openfoam and the two dimensional 2d strip theory hydrodynamic forces are calculated through the pimple algorithm in each 2d fluid strip the finite element method fem combined with the newmark β method are used to calculate vibrations of the flexible cylinder in both crossflow and inline directions the cylinder model is pinned at both ends with top and bottom support frames forced to harmonically oscillate in the inline direction which contributes to the generation of a relative oscillatory flow between the still water and the flexible cylinder mesh and fluid strip convergence studies are conducted to choose the appropriate computational model for subsequent simulations simulation results and experiment results are in good agreement that verifies the validity of the solver comparisons among simulations with different aspect ratios are analyzed detailedly the maximum vibration amplitude the dominant vibration mode and the non dimensional dominant vibration frequency in both directions are enlarged apparently with the increase of the cylinder aspect ratio the typical vibration trajectory changes from the butterfly type to the stripe type with l d increases keywords vortex induced vibration viv foam sjtu solver oscillatory flow aspect ratio 1 introduction when the viscous flow with a certain velocity goes through a circular cylinder vortices will be generated on the cylinder surface and then shed behind the cylinder the asymmetric vortex shedding contributes to the fluctuated lift force in the cross flow direction which then leads to the viv phenomenon when the vortex shedding frequency approaches around the cylinder natural frequency the resonance phenomenon happens and the vibration amplitude will be amplified obviously in deep sea oil and gas exploitation viv of the marine riser is one of the main sources resulting in the fatigue damage during the past decades viv features of a single cylinder had been studied extensively by researchers such as williamson and govardhan 2004 sarpkaya 2004 huang et al 2009 ji et al 2015 chen et al 2016 and wan and duan 2017 in order to predict viv response of the deep sea riser the 2d strip method was proposed by willden and graham 2001 2004 and benchmark simulations were conducted to verify its validity meanwhile the multi modes vibration phenomenon was observed when the cylinder aspect ratio was extremely large yamamoto et al 2004 and sun et al 2012 also adopted this method to carry out viv researches simulation results were in good agreement with published data and experiment results which further verified the validity of the strip method researches on viv of a flexible cylinder in the oscillatory flow are comparatively fewer than that in the steady flows the relative oscillatory flow is generated between the marine riser and the water due to the periodical top end oscillation of the riser connected to the floating platform which results from the effects of winds waves and currents in the ocean environment the complexity of the oscillatory flow leads to different viv responses of the cylinder from that in the steady flow therefore viv of a rigid cylinder in oscillatory flow was studied firstly to capture its vibration and vortex shedding features williamson 1985 and sarpkaya 1986 conducted experiments on viv of a rigid cylinder in the relative oscillatory flow systematically and representative vortex shedding regimes were identified within a particular range of keulegan carpenter kc numbers bearman 1989 studied the effects of kc numbers and stokes numbers through the experimental method while different vortex shedding regimes were observed too in order to deeply understand the vibration responses sumer and fredsøe 1988 carried out experiments on transverse vibration of a rigid cylinder exposed to the oscillatory flow with kc numbers ranging from 5 to 100 kozakiewicz et al 1997 and zhao et al 2012 carried out experiments and numerical simulations on viv of a fixed and a freely vibrating circular cylinder in relative oscillatory flow with different reduced velocities at kc 10 and 20 respectively they found that the vortex shedding direction and wake structures changed apparently due to the crossflow vibration of the cylinder zhao et al 2012 also concluded that the reduced velocity presented significant effects on the xy trajectory mode of the cylinder and the maximum crossflow vibration amplitude was comparatively smaller than that in the inline direction when the reduced velocity was extremely large further zhao et al 2013a 2013b carried out simulations on viv of a cylinder with one dof degree of freedom and two dofs experiencing the oscillatory flow and the mixed flow respectively nehari et al 2004 concentrated on the numerical method effects to viv response of a circular cylinder between three dimensional 3d and two dimensional 2d models scandura et al 2009 investigated vorticity dynamics and forces induced by the oscillatory flow over a circular cylinder adopting the direct numerical simulation dns method zhao and cheng 2014 also conducted researches on vortex shedding regimes of two circular cylinders in tandem and side by side arrangements using 2d model effects of kc numbers and gap ratios between two cylinders were mainly investigated tong et al 2015 focused on flow patterns of four cylinders in square arrangement exposed to the oscillatory flow under low kc numbers and reynolds re numbers flow patterns were classified based on the known flow regimes around a single cylinder pearcey et al 2017 performed 2d investigations on transverse vibration of two rigid connected cylinders with different diameter at kc 10 orientation and gap effects were mainly studied varying from the tandem arrangement to the side by side arrangement the specific intermittent switch among different vortex regimes was observed munir et al 2018 carried out 2d numerical simulations considering the plane boundary effects simulations were conducted at kc 5 and 10 with the reduced velocities varied from 1 to 15 while four gap ratios between the cylinder and the plane were mainly investigated it was found that the plane boundary played significant effects in the crossflow vibration response of the cylinder non vortex shedding regime was observed at large reduced velocity at kc 10 resulting from absorption effects of shear layers generated from the plane boundary to vortices meanwhile fonias and grigoriadis 2018 also carried out similar researches using the 3d simulation model they found that the suppression of the boundary layer separation phenomenon would happen when the gap ratio was smaller than 0 05 nevertheless viv of a long flexible cylinder showed quite different vibration characteristics resulting from the axial deformation fu et al 2013 and wang et al 2014 carried out experiments on viv of a flexible cylinder in the oscillatory flow at kc 178 and 84 respectively the specific building up lock in dying out viv developing process was proposed effects of the oscillating period on viv features were studied furthermore wang et al 2015 studied the fatigue damage induced by viv in the oscillatory flow adopting an empirical viv predicting model thorsen et al 2016 and yuan et al 2018 also proposed semi empirical models to predict viv response in the oscillatory flow based on experiments of wang et al 2014 fu et al 2018 carried out numerical simulations at the same condition and compared with experiment results detailedly ren et al 2019 carried out experiments on viv of a flexible cylinder fitted with helical strakes in the oscillatory flow with kc numbers varying from 21 to 165 effects on viv suppression features from the helical strakes are mainly studied however most previous researches mainly concentrated on comparatively low aspect ratio which was smaller than 200 actually viv of a flexible cylinder with large aspect ratio shows more complicated characteristics such as extreme high vibration mode the travelling wave phenomenon multi modes vibration and etc lie and kaasen 2006 carried out experiments of a large scale cylinder in the sheared flow with the aspect ratio reached 3000 the maximum 29th vibration mode and the obvious travelling wave phenomenon along the cylinder span were observed xu et al 2008 adopted the wake oscillator model to study viv of a flexible cylinder with high aspect ratio in uniform and sheared flows they found that nonlinear effects become more significant with the increase of the cylinder aspect ratio duan et al 2017 also studied viv responses in uniform and sheared flow conditions with the cylinder aspect ratio ranging from 500 to 1000 they found that the multi modes vibration phenomenon become more obvious especially at high aspect ratios although abundant researches of a large scale flexible cylinder in steady flow conditions had been conducted using both experimental and numerical methods studies on viv in the oscillatory flow with similar cylinder model were limited hence effects of the cylinder aspect ratio to viv responses in the oscillatory flow are mainly studied in this paper using the viv foam sjtu solver based on experiments of fu et al 2013 and simulations of fu et al 2018 the cylinder aspect ratio varies from 167 to 667 particular variations on the mode transition phenomenon in the half oscillatory period and vibration trajectories along the cylinder are analyzed this paper is organized as followed the numerical method used in this paper is introduced in section 2 followed by validation studies in section 3 including the mesh convergence study the fluid strip number convergence study and the verification study of the solver simulation results and corresponding discussions are presented in section 4 finally section 5 gives a brief summary 2 numerical method 2 1 problem description in this paper the fundamental simulation is carried out referring to experiments of fu et al 2013 the layout of model experiments is shown in fig 1 the water keeps still and support frames at both ends of the horizontal flexible cylinder are forced to oscillate in the inline direction x direction while the cylinder is allowed to freely vibrate in the crossflow direction y direction main parameters of the cylinder model are listed in table 1 the periodical oscillation of support frames can be expressed as eq 1 and eq 2 1 a t a m sin 2 π t t 2 u t 2 π a m t cos 2 π t t u

velocity of support frames the relative oscillatory flow between the still water and the oscillating cylinder can be represented by the kc number which denotes the connection between the maximum oscillating amplitude and the diameter of the flexible cylinder as shown in eq 3 3 k c 2 π a m d where d is the diameter of the cylinder 2 2 two dimensional strip theory for a flexible cylinder with large aspect ratio the direct numerical simulation of the 3d fluid field will cost super abundant computational resources and time in order to solve this problem willden and graham 2001 2004 put forward the 2d strip method in predicting viv responses of long flexible cylinders this method simplifies the 3d fluid field into several 2d fluid strips equally distributed along the cylinder span hydrodynamic forces are calculated in each 2d strip which then are applied to structural elements after the computation of vibrations nodal displacements are interpolated to the corresponding fluid strips to update the dynamic mesh and then start the next cycle of computation the schematic diagram of the 2d strip method is shown in fig 2 this method is very appropriate for solving fluid and structure interaction fsi problems with supramaximal computation domain it owns high computational efficiency and the computational accuracy is reliable comparing with dns method which has been verified through previous researches such as meneghini et al 2004 and yamamoto et al 2004 in present study all simulations are carried out using the viv foam sjtu solver which is developed based on the open source toolbox openfoam and the 2d strip method hydrodynamic forces acted on the cylinder are computed from viscous forces and pressure forces using the pimple algorithm in the openfoam integrated over the surface of the cylinder in each fluid strip the connection among all fluid strips is achieved through the inline and crossflow vibrations of the cylinder calculated from the structural field using the fem method with the newmark β algorithm the reliability of the solver in predicting viv responses in steady flows has been verified by duan et al 2016a where the benchmark simulation results have been compared with the experiment results in detail employing this solver duan et al 2016b 2018 and wang et al 2019 have conducted abundant numerical investigations on viv of a single flexible cylinder in uniform sheared and stepped flows respectively 2 3 hydrodynamic governing equations in order to obtain viv responses hydrodynamic forces in both directions should be calculated first during the simulation the flow field is supposed to be incompressible with constant dynamic viscosity μ and constant density ρ reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans are chosen as hydrodynamic governing equations expressed in eq 4 and eq 5 the sst k ω turbulence model is used to compute the reynolds stress and no wall functions are used in present study fu et al 2018 and zhao 2013 also adopted the same numerical methods to investigate viv responses of a flexible and a circular cylinder experiencing an oscillatory flow respectively and verified its reliability 4 u

can be considered as a flexural elastic structure satisfying the bernoulli euler bending beam hypothesis thus the cylinder vibrations are calculated through this model and the fem method in this paper the support excitation method that has been verified available in solving structural vibrations of a flexible cylinder with large scale motions by fu et al 2018 is used in present study the inline displacement x direction can be written as the sum of the support frame motion and the relative inline vibration of the cylinder shown as eq 14 14 x t o t a l z t x f r a m e t x z t where x t o t a l z t is the total inline displacement of all nodes along the cylinder x f r a m e t is the support frame displacement at both ends x z t is the relative inline vibration displacement the equilibrium of force components in the system can be expressed as eq 15 15 f h y d r o f i n e r t i a l f d a m p i n g f s p r i n g where f h y d r o is the hydrodynamic force acted on the cylinder f i n e r t i a l is the inertial force calculated through the kinetic energy of the cylinder f d a m p i n g is the damping force calculated through the damping and the vibration velocity of the cylinder f s p r i n g is the spring force calculated through the stiffness and the vibration displacement of the cylinder then the mass spring damping mck equations of the system in both directions can be written as eq 16 and eq 17 16 m x c x k x f h y d r o x m x f r a m e 17 m y c y k y f h y d r o y where m c k are the mass the damping and the stiffness of the system f h y d r o x f h y d r o y are the inline and the crossflow hydrodynamic forces respectively through the fem method the governing equations of the system can be expressed as eq 18 and eq 19 18 m x c x k x f hx m x frame 19 m y c y k y f hy where m c k are the mass damping and stiffness matrixes of the system x frame is the acceleration vector of the support frame in the in line direction f hx f hy are hydrodynamic force vectors in both directions the rayleigh damping is used to generate the damping matrix as shown in eq 20 and eq 21 based on the first two natural frequencies of the cylinder listed in table 1 20 c α m β k 21 α β 2 ς f n 1 f n 2 2 π f n 1 f n 2 1 2 π where α and β are proportionality coefficient ς is the damping ratio f n 1 and f n 2 are the first two natural frequencies of the cylinder 3 validation studies 3 1 numerical model setup the 2d strip theory requires calculating hydrodynamic forces in multiple 2d fluid planes located at intervals along the cylinder span therefore a suitable choice of the fluid strip number and the mesh resolution is benefit for the well capture of the highest vibration mode and the prediction of hydrodynamic forces through researches of willden and graham 2001 2004 they found that a minimum of three fluid strips were required per vibration mode for correct capture on the axial variation of the phasing of the hydrodynamic forces with respect to the cylinder vibration during their simulations 64 fluid strips were used with the maximum vibration mode reached around the 10th mode considering the dominant vibration mode in the experiment of fu et al 2013 kept the 1st mode at kc 178 20 fluid strips are sufficient to capture the 1st mode in the validation study the layout of the computational model is shown in fig 3 all strips share the same computational domain and mesh distribution velocity inlet condition is specified at the inlet boundary and pressure outlet condition is applied in the outlet boundary wall condition is specified at the cylinder surface boundary while symmetry conditions are for the top and bottom boundaries on account of the finite volume method used in the openfoam the 3d computational grid is required during the flow field calculation therefore the empty condition which represents the neglect of numerical simulation in the axial direction z direction specified at the front and back boundaries realizes the generation of the 2d computational grid as shown in fig 4 a the dynamic mesh technique is used to update the computational mesh at every time step since the kc number is set to be 178 in all simulations the oscillating amplitude of support frames in the inline direction is extremely large compared with the crossflow vibration amplitude in order to guarantee the mesh quality during simulations each fluid strip is 180d in the inline direction and 40d in the crossflow direction mesh near the cylinder surface is refined and the y keeps around 2 0 in all simulations to predict turbulence kinetic energy in the boundary layer as shown in fig 4 b the updated mesh is shown in fig 4 c and d when support frames oscillate to its leftmost position it can be found that the computational mesh of the left part has been compressed while the right part has been stretched obviously however the mesh around the cylinder surface almost keeps the same as that at the initial condition in the circular domain which guarantees the mesh quality and minimizes the effect of mesh deformation during the hydrodynamic forces calculation the flexible cylinder is discretized into 80 structural elements with 81 nodes in total the time step is set as 0 0002s to ensure the courant number lower than 2 0 during the implicit solution process which guarantees the stability and the convergence rate in all simulations in order to analyze the vibration frequency features the modal analysis method that has been testified to be valid by chaplin et al 2005 and fu et al 2018 is adopted thus displacements in the crossflow and the inline directions can be expressed as the sum of a series of modal shapes as followed 22 ϕ m z sin m π l z 23 x z t m 1 n u m t ϕ m z 24 y z t m 1 n v m t ϕ m z where z is the axial location of the structural nodes l is the cylinder length m 1 2 3 and etc x z t is the relative inline displacement of all nodes along the cylinder y z t is the crossflow displacement of all nodes u m t is the time dependent modal weight vector of the mth mode in the inline direction v m t is the time dependent modal weight vector of the mth mode in the crossflow direction and n is the mode number then figures of modal decomposition and power spectral density psd of each modal weight normalized by the cylinder diameter d are obtained 3 2 mesh convergence study computational mesh convergence study is conducted among three meshes with 0 45 million 0 8 million and 1 4 million cells to verify the mesh dependence magnitudes of the crossflow and inline vibration responses are provided by the standard deviations std with respect to time of the std of y z t and x z t over z as expressed in eq 25 and 26 std of modal weights σ v m and σ u m are defined in the same way the natural frequencies f n m the mth order of the natural frequency of the cylinder are normalized by the strouhal frequency as shown in eq 27 25 σ y 1 t 0 t 1 l 0 l y z t 2 d z d t 26 σ x 1 t 0 t 1 l 0 l x z t x z 2 d z d t 27 f s u m s t d where x z is the time averaged inline displacement t is the time interval for data processing st 0 2 is the strouhal number used in present analysis fig 5 shows comparison of vibration displacements std along the cylinder in both directions which presents the 1st modal shape among different mesh resolutions relatively obvious computational errors can be observed between the coarse mesh and the medium mesh of the maximum crossflow displacement std and its corresponding axial location meanwhile good agreement is obtained among three meshes in the inline direction fig 6 shows comparison of non dimensional vibration modal weights std versus non dimensional natural frequencies among three mesh resolutions the peak vibration mode in each fold line represents the dominant vibration mode of the cylinder the cylinder shows the 1st vibration mode where the corresponding non dimensional frequency is around 1 in both directions indicating the occurrence of the resonance phenomenon effects of other vibration modes are too small to be considered it can be known that the dominant vibration mode and the corresponding modal weight amplitude agree well between the medium mesh and the fine mesh while computational errors exist between the medium mesh and the coarse mesh in both directions therefore the medium mesh with 0 8 million cells is employed for further investigations based on the mesh resolution convergence study 3 3 fluid strips convergence study the fluid strips convergence study among 10 strips 20 strips and 40 strips respectively is carried out at l d 167 fig 7 and fig 8 are comparisons of std of vibration displacements and modal weights in both directions from these figures it can be found that good agreement of the maximum vibration displacement std and its corresponding axial location can be obtained between the 20 fluid strips simulation and the 40 fluid strips simulation in both directions comparatively large computation error is observed from 10 fluid strips simulation in the crossflow direction where both the maximum vibration displacement std and its axial location are overestimated the 1st dominant vibration mode is correctly captured in both directions among three simulations from modal weights std variation tendency from the 2nd vibration mode to the 6th vibration mode shows high degree of similarity with the same magnitude meanwhile comparisons on viv responses of a flexible cylinder with larger aspect ratio between 20 fluid strips and 40 fluid strips at the same conditions are also conducted fig 9 shows corresponding modal weights std in both directions it can be found that the variation tendency shows high similarity especially at l d 333 and 500 in both directions although comparatively large computational errors appear at the 1st vibration mode in both directions when the aspect ratio reaches 667 dominant vibration modes are correctly captured with the same magnitude using different number of fluid strips it can be concluded that 20 fluid strips can capture main vibration characteristics well with comparatively fewer computational meshes and computational time in present study 3 4 numerical validation study comparison of the viv developing process in half an oscillating period between previous experiment and present simulation is presented in fig 10 to analyze viv responses in the half oscillatory flow three specific regions of building up lock in and dying out are defined based on the boundary value of 2 a m 2 d by fu et al 2013 the definition of the special lock in region in the viv developing process represents the drastic viv with comparatively large vibration displacement in each half period which is different from the normal concept of the resonance phenomenon where the vortex shedding frequency closes to the natural frequency of the cylinder the lock in region is 17 3 of the half oscillating period in the present simulation from fig 10 b which agrees well with the experiment result of 17 from fig 10 a of fu et al 2013 the maximum non dimensional crossflow vibration amplitude in present simulation is larger than the experiment which may result from the simplification of the practical damping replaced by the rayleigh damping comparisons of more vibration responses are shown in fig 11 fig 11 a shows viv responses from experiments of fu et al 2013 it can be found that the specific intermittent viv feature is observed during multiple oscillating periods the dominant vibration mode presents the 1st vibration mode and the dominant vibration frequency is around 2 1hz and effects of the 2nd vibration mode to viv responses are extremely weak in contrast to the 1st vibration mode fig 11 b to fig 11 d are simulation results of the non dimensional time dependent crossflow displacement at the mid span cylinder non dimensional time dependent modal weights and the corresponding modal psd respectively fig 11 b also presents the same intermittent viv phenomenon as the experiment with the maximum vibration amplitude shows a bit larger than that of experiment the dominant vibration mode of the cylinder shows the 1st vibration mode from the modal weight comparison in fig 11 c values of the 2nd the 3rd and the 4th modal weights are extremely smaller than that of the 1st vibration mode which is also familiar with experiment results in fig 11 a the vibration frequency region in multiple oscillating periods varies from around 1 9hz 2 7hz showing in fig 11 d which is in good agreement with the frequency analysis result in the third subplot from fig 11 a the dominant vibration frequency corresponding to the 1st dominant vibration mode is around 2 0hz in present simulation from the peak value in fig 11 d which closes to the experiment result of 2 1hz from fu et al 2013 from these comparisons it can be known that simulation results are in good agreement with experiment results and the validity of the solver is verified 4 results and discussions 4 1 time domain vibration responses comparisons of nodal vibration responses from numerical simulations of a flexible cylinder with different aspect ratios in an oscillatory flow are analyzed detailedly in this section almost all parameters of these numerical models keep the same as the fundamental simulation except that the cylinder axial length varies from 8 to 16 with an interval of 4 it means that cylinder aspect ratios are 167 333 500 and 667 respectively in the following analysis fig 12 presents non dimensional crossflow vibration displacements at 9 locations along the cylinder in multiple oscillating periods vibration displacement of support frames gets to zero when t i 0 or 0 5 t i 0 1 2 etc t 16 5s as presented in eq 1 while the corresponding relative oscillatory flow velocity gets its maximum value while the relative velocity will approach zero when vibration displacement of support frames gets to its peaks and valleys at t i 0 25 t and i 0 75 t respectively the specific lock in region defined by fu et al 2013 occurs at around t 2 5t and 3 0t in fig 12 a when the frame velocity gets its maximum value the maximum vibration amplitude at the mid span cylinder is around 0 5d in the lock in region when l d 167 while it decreases to around 0 1d at locations of z l 0 1 and 0 9 the vibration amplitude shows the same magnitude in building up and dying out regions where viv responses are comparatively weaker than that in the lock in region when the cylinder aspect ratio increases to 333 the maximum non dimensional crossflow vibration amplitude increases to around 0 8 around the mid span cylinder as shown in fig 13 b the vibration amplitude at z l 0 1 and 0 9 increases to around 0 3d which is three times of that at l d 167 the vibration amplitude variation among all locations along the cylinder at l d 333 shows similar tendency as that at l d 167 the maximum non dimensional crossflow vibration amplitude at locations of z l 0 2 and 0 8 increases to around 0 8 in the lock in region when the cylinder aspect ratio reaches 500 as shown in fig 12 c meanwhile the maximum vibration amplitude at the mid span cylinder decreases to around 0 5d the vibration amplitude variation tendency at l d 500 is opposite to that at l d 167 and 333 no apparent increase of the vibration amplitude appears in building up and dying out regions due to the weak viv responses of the cylinder in these regions where the oscillating velocities are close to zero the non dimensional crossflow vibration amplitude is around 0 8 at nodes of z l 0 2 and 0 8 when the cylinder aspect ratio reaches 667 while the vibration amplitude increases to around 0 7d at the mid span cylinder compared with that at l d 500 it can be found that the specific intermittent viv developing process varies obviously with the increase of the cylinder aspect ratio compared between fig 12 a and d non dimensional inline displacements along the cylinder span in multiple oscillating periods are presented in fig 13 the maximum relative non dimensional inline vibration amplitude increases from around 0 25 to 5 0 with the increase of the cylinder aspect ratio since the oscillation of support frames shows a sinusoidal function shape as expressed in eq 1 the relative oscillatory flow u w can be written as followed 28 u w t u m cos 2 π t t it is obvious that the relative oscillatory flow velocity and the relative inline displacement are synchronous it can be found in fig 13 a that the maximum relative non dimensional inline vibration displacement around its inline equilibrium position gets to its maximum value at t i 0 or 0 5 t i 0 1 2 etc where the support frames move across the original position and the corresponding oscillating velocity gets to its maximum the vibration amplitude gets its maximum value at the mid span cylinder during all simulations which is very different from the crossflow variation tendency at high aspect ratios compared between figs 13 d and fig 12 d where the dominant inline vibration mode keeps the 1st mode and the dominant crossflow vibration mode increase to the 2nd and 3rd modes a high frequency vibration phenomenon is observed at the rightmost or the leftmost positions during the oscillation of support frames the source of the special phenomenon may result from the reattachment effects of existing vortices shed during the previous half oscillating period which has been detailed explained in simulation of fu et al 2018 when the cylinder aspect ratio gets larger this high vibration frequency phenomenon turns to happen mainly in the lock in region another significant finding is that an inflection point is observed at t 0 25 or 0 75 i t i 0 1 2 etc in building up and dying out regions when support frames approach its rightmost or leftmost positions non dimensional crossflow spatio temporal displacements and typical vibration deflections along the cylinder are shown in fig 14 and fig 15 where the red to blue color bar represents the magnitude of the crossflow vibration displacement crossflow vibration of all nodes is in phase from the spatio temporal displacement along the cylinder in fig 14 a it can be known that the cylinder presents the 1st dominant vibration mode which corresponds to the typical crossflow vibration deflection in fig 15 a crossflow vibrations of upper and nether nodes transfers from in phase vibration to anti phase vibration when the cylinder aspect ratio increases to 333 which contributes to the vibration shape transition phenomenon from the 1st mode shape to the 2nd mode shape around the lock in region as shown in figs 14 b and fig 15 b the travelling wave phenomenon along the cylinder span can be observed between two standing wave phenomena the 1st modal standing wave occurred in the lock in region with larger vibration amplitude than that of the 2nd modal standing wave which can be observed through the gradation of the red or blue color combining fig 12 c with figs 14 c and fig 15 c the vibration shape transition phenomenon of the 1st modal standing wave travelling wave 2nd modal standing wave developing process is also observed the main difference between l d 333 and l d 500 is that the 2nd vibration shape is occurred and becomes the dominant vibration shape in the lock in region the 1st vibration shape mainly occurs in building up and dying out regions the variation on the dominant vibration shape corresponds to the variation shown in fig 12 at l d 500 the vibration deflection increases to the 2nd and the 3rd mode shapes when l d 667 the 3rd modal standing wave is observed in the lock in region and the 2nd modal standing wave is observed in building up and dying out regions while the vibration shape transition phenomenon occurs between them the vibration deflection changes from single mode to multi modes under the effect of the cylinder aspect ratio the dominant vibration deflection increases from the 1st vibration shape to the 3rd vibration shape in the lock in region with the cylinder aspect ratio increases as shown in fig 15 the vibration shape transition phenomenon of the standing wave travelling wave standing wave developing process can be observed clearly when the cylinder aspect ratio is larger than 333 as shown in figs 14 and 15 the travelling wave phenomenon can only be observed during each viv developing process when the viv regions change from the building up region to the lock in region or from the lock in region to the dying out region where the relative oscillatory flow velocity changes obviously as shown in fig 14 b c and d comparison of displacements std along the cylinder in both directions present in fig 16 it can be found that the maximum non dimensional displacement std increases from 0 15 at the mid span cylinder to 0 35 at z l 0 2 and 0 8 which are in good agreement with the crossflow vibration variation tendency in fig 12 the vibration shape along the cylinder span increases from the 1st mode shape to the 3rd mode shape when l d increases from 167 to 667 the maximum non dimensional inline displacement std increases from 0 2 to 3 05 as shown in fig 16 b with the increase of the cylinder aspect ratio however the vibration deflection keeps the 1st mode shape in all simulations which corresponds with the sinusoidal shape of the time dependent inline vibration displacements as shown in fig 13 it represents that the 1st mode plays remarkable controlling effect to the inline vibration responses of the cylinder 4 2 modal and frequency domain responses comparison of modal weights and corresponding modal psd of the cylinder in the crossflow and inline directions are presented in fig 17 and fig 18 respectively the modal psd is normalized by the 1st natural frequency f n l d 1 of the cylinder the first two order natural frequencies of the cylinder among different aspect ratios are shown in table 2 it can be found that the dominant vibration mode of the cylinder at l d 167 is apparently the 1st vibration mode from fig 17 a effects of higher vibration modes are too small to be considered multi frequency components are observed in the modal psd variation on the oscillating velocity leads to the variation of the re number and vortex shedding features in each half oscillating period two frequency peaks in the modal psd of fig 17 a correspond to vibration frequencies in each lock in region during the viv developing process in an oscillating period lower frequency components in the modal psd represent corresponding vibration frequencies in building up and dying out regions when l d 333 as shown in fig 17 b the dominant vibration mode keeps the 1st vibration mode as l d 167 the dominant vibration frequency in the lock in region is around 1 4 f n l d 333 1 although effects of the 2nd vibration mode become obvious at l d 333 it is still covered by the 1st vibration mode during most time the dominant vibration mode will turn to the 2nd vibration mode only when the modal weight amplitude of the 2nd vibration mode exceeds the 1st vibration mode during the viv developing process such as at the time region from t 33s to t 35s as shown in the time dependent modal weights in fig 17 b therefore the mode transition phenomenon can hardly be observed however this phenomenon becomes more obvious when l d 500 the dominant vibration mode increases to the 2nd vibration mode with the corresponding dominant vibration frequency reaches around 2 2 f n l d 500 1 obvious modal weights of the 3rd and the 4th vibration modes whose effects to viv responses are totally covered by the 2nd vibration mode are also observed in fig 17 c multi dominant vibration modes phenomenon is generated when the aspect ratio increases to 667 as shown in fig 17 d since modal weight magnitudes of the 2nd and the 3rd vibration modes are very similar in the lock in region the dominant vibration mode will shift between these modes and vibration features will become more complicated corresponding dominant vibration frequencies are around 2 4 f n l d 667 1 and 3 0 f n l d 667 1 respectively it can be concluded that the dominant crossflow vibration mode will increase and the multi mode vibration phenomenon will appear with the increase of the cylinder aspect ratio although the non dimensional frequencies present a decrease tendency with the increase of the cylinder aspect ratio the actual dominant vibration frequencies still keep around 2 0hz due to the decrease of the natural frequencies the time dependent relative inline vibration shape of all nodes performs similar sinusoidal function shape as shown in fig 13 which contributes to the dominant 1st vibration mode in all simulations effects of higher vibration modes are totally covered due to the extremely large modal weight of the 1st vibration mode in order to analyze modal vibration characteristics in the inline direction the controlling effect of the 1st vibration mode on modal weights and corresponding modal psd is removed as presented in fig 18 the high order of vibration mode increases from the 2nd vibration mode to the 5th vibration mode at an interval of 1 with the increase of the cylinder aspect ratio the corresponding vibration frequency at l d 167 is around 2 0 f n l d 167 1 and it increases to around 3 3 f n l d 333 1 4 6 f n l d 500 1 and 5 8 f n l d 667 1 respectively when the cylinder aspect ratio increases from 333 to 667 high order vibration frequencies in the inline direction are around twice of dominant vibration frequencies in the crossflow direction at the same aspect ratio compared between figs 17 and 18 although more high order vibration modes are excited almost only one dominant vibration mode appears when removing the 1st dominant vibration mode in the inline direction observing from the time dependent modal weights it can also be found that multi modes vibration phenomenon appears when the aspect ratio increase to 500 as shown in fig 18 c which is similar to the phenomenon that observed in the crossflow direction as shown in fig 17 4 3 vibration trajectories in order to illustrate the relationship between the crossflow and the inline vibrations more directly vibration trajectories at 9 axial locations from z l 0 1 to 0 9 along the cylinder in an oscillating period are presented in fig 19 the obvious butterfly type of vibration trajectory can be observed at all locations when l d 167 and the butterfly shape at the mid span cylinder is larger than that at other locations which corresponds to the variation tendency of vibration displacements in figs 12 and 13 two sides of the butterfly trajectory are generated in the lock in region where crossflow and inline vibration amplitudes approach its maximum values at the same time the vibration amplitude decreases apparently in both directions when the vibration locates in building up and dying out regions which contributes to the generation of the middle part of the butterfly vibration trajectory when the aspect ratio reaches 333 the increase rate of the vibration amplitude in the inline direction is larger than that in the crossflow direction which leads to the comparatively large enlargement of the butterfly type of vibration trajectory in the inline direction as shown in fig 19 b meanwhile vibration shapes at all nodes keep the butterfly type due to the dominant 1st vibration modes in both directions since the dominant vibration mode transfers to the 2nd vibration mode in the crossflow direction and keeps the 1st vibration mode in the inline direction in the lock in region at l d 500 the butterfly type of vibration trajectory changes to the stripe type especially at the mid span cylinder as shown in fig 19 c the butterfly shape can still be observed at upper and nether nodes along the cylinder which is similar to that in fig 19 b the slenderness of the strip type of vibration trajectory increases when the cylinder aspect ratio increases to 667 the butterfly type of vibration trajectory gradually disappears on account of the appearance of the 3rd vibration mode in the lock in region from comparisons of vibration trajectories it can be found that the vibration trajectory shape turns from the butterfly type to the stripe type with the increase of the cylinder aspect ratio however axial locations near both ends of the cylinder hardly be affected and keep the butterfly type of vibration trajectory 5 conclusions a series of numerical investigations on viv of a flexible cylinder in an oscillatory flow with different aspect ratios have been conducted in this paper using the viv foam sjtu solver the fundamental simulation is based on experiments of fu et al 2013 at kc 178 simulation results have been compared and analyzed detailedly the specific building up lock in dying out viv developing process is also observed in present study in order to exclude disturbances from the mesh resolution and the number of fluid strips computational mesh and fluid strips convergence studies have been carried out the medium mesh with 0 8 million cells and 20 fluid strips has been chosen for subsequent simulations in the crossflow direction the dominant vibration mode increases from the 1st vibration mode to the 3rd vibration mode with the increase of the cylinder aspect ratio the maximum vibration amplitude increases remarkably when the aspect ratio increase from 167 to 500 the vibration amplitude decreases to around 0 7d and the multi modes vibration phenomenon appears when the aspect ratio reaches 667 in the inline direction the dominant vibration mode keeps the 1st vibration mode and the maximum vibration amplitude keeps increasing from around 0 25d to 5 0d the normalized dominant vibration frequency varies from 0 75 f n l d 167 1 to 3 0 f n l d 667 1 in the crossflow direction and from 2 0 f n l d 167 1 to 5 8 f n l d 667 1 in the inline direction as for the vibration trajectory it changes from the butterfly shape to the slender stripe shape when the cylinder aspect ratio increases while it keeps the butterfly shape at locations near both ends of the cylinder in

20239,inspiring from nature flying near the ground surface might increase the aerodynamic performance of micro aerial vehicles mavs because of the being small in size these birds have low flight speeds and their operating range is in the low reynolds flow zone r e 2 0 10 5 where a laminar separation bubble lsb normally appears on the suction surface of a wing in this study the interaction of lsb formed on a full span wing with the cross section of nasa ls 1 0417 and ground clearance is investigated at the critical reynolds number 5 10 4 2 10 5 the behavioral changes of the separation bubbles in free flow and near the ground surface have been numerically discussed in detail by different distances away from the ground h c and various angle of attack 8 12 14 and 16 furthermore the patterns and behavior of multiple flows affected by the interaction of the separation bubble phenomenon with ground effect is discussed from the points of view of vortex fields phase portrait frequency analysis existing stresses and velocity profiles the main outcomes reveal that the ground effect s general role does not work in this region of flow and the aerodynamic performance of the full span wing is decreased near the ground due to the bubbles furthermore at 0 2 h c 1 the phase portrait curves have an elliptical shape due to the bursting of the separation bubble graphical

used in most services and various missions including urban and biological commercial and industrial applications to prevent human and environmental losses in turn this has led to an increase in demand from industries related to the construction of unmanned micro air vehicles these flyers are small in size compared to other aircraft and due to their small size and low flight speed they usually have aerodynamic problems among other things their aerodynamic performance is highly influenced by flight conditions and its regime because of the being small in size these birds have low flight speeds and their operating range is in the low reynolds flow zone r e 2 0 10 5 esmaeili et al 2018 sunada et al 2000 winslow et al 2018 the flyers aerodynamic performance and the flow of physics in the reynolds range as mentioned earlier undergo drastic changes and the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil suddenly declines sharply esmaeili et al 2018 this means that mavs flying in this area will face many problems which indicates the importance of further study in this area to improve the flight quality of mavs what reduces the performance of lifting surfaces in this flight area is the presence of a laminar boundary layer and its tendency to detach from the surface and form a separation bubble of a laminar boundary layer even at a low incidence angle which was investigated by m s genç genç et al 2018 d j pines pines and bohorquez 2006 and w zhang zhang and samtaney 2016 over the past decade many kinds of research were done to understand this phenomenon physics and behavior for instance hansen et al 2011 investigated the effect of a passive flow control method to prevent stall occurrence they showed that the flow with reynolds 1 2 10 5 is associated with bubbles separated in the laminar boundary layer which harms the aerofoil s performance they also observed that the lift coefficient in the pre and post stall regime depends on the airfoil s geometry and the appearance of bubbles on its surface leads to significant deformation of the airfoil and is able to neutralize the effects of the control method used by them yang et al 2007 also found that to control this undesirable phenomenon it is necessary to know this phenomenon s characteristics including length thickness and the factors affecting them they showed that by changing the angle of attack aoa the separation bubble s length was more affected by the conditions the bubble s length decreases by about 20 by increasing the attack angle while the bubble thickness changes by only 1 in parallel with previous research genç ms et al genç et al 2018 also studied the effect of different aspect ratios on the separation bubble of the laminar boundary layer flowing with reynolds at 0 75 10 5 0 5 10 5 and 0 25 10 5 for aspect ratios ar of 1 and 3 their results indicate that by reducing the ar the length of the bubble formed is shorter due to the tip vortex flow and the three dimensional effects of the flow however they showed that the lsb in cruise flight mode without considering any interaction with other aerodynamic phenomena leads to decreased lift force increased drag vibration turbulence and air vehicle instability on the other hand due to the low endurance flight mavs have many landings during a mission and due to their small size they will usually operate at a close distance to the surfaces such as the ground and walls therefore ground effect phenomena play an essential role in the performance of small flyers and the appearance of an lsb on their wings can stimulate it positively or negatively of course the ground effect and its aerodynamic impacts on flyers wings have been solely considered for many years many numerical and experimental studies have been performed on this phenomenon especially in reynolds number above the critical range among them it can be referred to the work of he wei et al he et al 2019b who studied the non modal linear stability around the naca 4415 aerofoil near the ground surface at low reynolds numbers and high attack angles research by gene li et al 2017 and foshat 2020 also examined flow separation on an inclined plate and acknowledged that the ground s surface could play a vital role in the flow s structure the desired geometry in this regard zhai x et al zhai et al 2020 like he et al 2019a have numerically simulated naca 4415 airfoil at r e 200 in high aoa 18 by the effect of different types of stationary grounds they understood that increasing the undulation amplitude h 0 of the ground ends up to a higher lift coefficient increasing h 0 was found to decrease the growth rates and frequencies of the kelvin helmholtz and stationary modes which illustrate that the spanwise periodicity length of the leading stationary disturbances in the wake of an aerofoil is in order of two times of chord lengths for more precise investigation di ilio g et al di ilio et al 2018 experimented on naca 0012 in low reynolds number and different aoa they realized vortex shedding regime starts at reynolds at 1000 and 8 aoa they also found the critical aoa would be 26 for which the stall phenomenon occurs also they pinpointed the significant effect of vortices on the shear stress distribution and the efficacy of plate to ground distance on flow acceleration besides djavareshkian et al examined the two dimensional djavareshkian et al 2011 and three dimensional mehraban and djavareshkian 2020 numerical simulations of a wing in the ground s presence and studied the effect of the smart airfoil near the surface at reynolds 0 24 10 5 umar et al umar and sun 2018 then investigated the numerical simulation of the ground effect interaction in drones flap motion at low reynolds flows within the range of 10 5 to 3 10 5 the effect of diffusion of vortices from the wing s trailing edge and the growth of the boundary layer formed on the ground surface was also studied experimentally and numerically by lu et al 2016 however the surface effect can be seen in the design of formula one racing machines the wings mounted on formula one cars were studied by robert et al roberts et al 2016 2019 in 2016 changing the reynolds number from 1 63 10 5 to 2 44 10 5 for a zero degree attack angle was studied still the study showed no evidence of bubble and its effect on the vehicle s aerodynamic performance aftab et al 2016 djavareshkian and esmaeli 2011 2012 2011 esmaeili 2012 kurtulus 2018 in the meantime ahmed m r ahmed 2005 has numerically investigated naca 4415 airfoil at various aoa and the ground clearance he has discovered that there would be a strong suction effect on the lower surface at low aoa zero to 2 5 furthermore reducing ground clearance would lead to an increase in in the lift force more on that decreasing the pressure drag will have strong component in the negative drag direction increasing the aoa to 10 would make the adverse pressure gradient occur also they have found that increasing the aoa leads to high value pressure coefficient on the pressure side with broaden high pressure territory till the trailing edge of the aerofoil ahmed and sharma 2005 however during the last decade research has been conducted on the landing of mini aerial vehicles and the effect of disturbances and environmental phenomena on the landing phase has been studied huh and shim 2010 nevertheless there is a scarcity of studies on the flight close to the ground especially in the critical reynolds number flows which is more challenging and high complexities of flow physics analysis due to lsbs in spite of all this study is focused on the interaction of lsbs formed on the full span wing type of flying micro aerial vehicles with ground clearness therefore an aerofoil is considered for different attack angles on which the laminar bubble is formed at distances away from the surface by reducing the aerofoil s height from the surface the changes made to this bubble are analyzed due to the low speed of micro aerial vehicles and their small size the considered reynolds is equal to 1 69 10 5 which is in the critical reynolds range firstly this paper evaluates the effects of the vicinity of the surface on the length and thickness of the laminar bubble secondly it investigates the behavior of the flow frequency changes in such situations of presence and absence of lsb existence these interactions have also been considered by their effects on the structure of vortices phase portraits and flow vibrational energy 2 equations governing flow and numerical modeling the governing equations of fluid flow are the equation of mass conservation momentum and scalar quantity all of which can be derived from the navier stokes equations djavareshkian and esmaeili 2013 these equations are numerically discretized through the finite volume method and then applied to all volume controls based on gaussian theory the convection flux is calculated by the central difference method and the displacement flux is calculated by the second order upwind difference method finally by solving the discrete equations based on the pressure based method and relies on the simple algorithm the governing flow field can be obtained also the solver used in this research is a high order solver which called monotonic upstream centered scheme for conservation laws musl so that the simulations can be tracked with high accuracy the solution process was considered transient on the other hand it tries to improve the stability range and discretization accuracy with the help of the dual time step algorithm in such a way that in each time step a certain number of internal iterations are used to achieve a certain amount of convergence this strategy generally helps to control severe gradients along with calculating their exact values optimally however the time integration was performed by employing a second order accurate implicit method to alleviate numerical stability restrictions the time step used in every simulation reported herein was 0 0004 although this value has been halved at a preliminary stage with the objective of confirming time step independence the simulations often had to be carried out longer than 40 s to reach a statistically converged unsteady state unaffected by initial transients time averaged results were typically computed from 400 instantaneous realizations of the flow covering about 10 s of simulation time to achieve the correct and real solution one of the critical elements in the numerical solution of fluid flow along with mesh generation and flow discretization algorithm is modeling turbulent flows due to the physical nature of the turbulence a great deal of information is needed to provide a desirable model hence relies on the physics of the problem in the present study the most appropriate turbulence model is the k ω shear stress transition sst turbulence model with two additional transfer equations for accurate prediction of the transition zone qu et al 2015 rostamzadeh et al 2017 in fact following the proposition of menter and langtry langtry and menter 2009 menter et al 2006 the k ω s s t turbulence model is combined with two transfer equations for intermittency γ and momentum thickness transfer start r e θ t respectively this model is commonly known as the transition sst model the transfer equation for intermittency is as follows 1 ρ γ t ρ u γ μ μ t γ p γ e γ where e γ is a destruction relaminarization source and p γ describes the transition sources the generated practical terms are applied to this equation to consider the length of the transition zone and its start the generated practical terms are also applied to this equation to consider the length of the transition zone and its start these terms operate based on the critical value of the local reynolds number in which intermittency begins to increase at the boundary layer the second parameter is the length of the transition zone which in turn is a function of the beginning of the transition in the local reynolds number and is calculated as a scalar transfer term using the following equation 2 re θ t t ure θ t 2 μ μ t re θ t p θ t where p θ t is basically derived from the difference between the transferred value and its local value and is considered as an additional experimental relation however to remove this term in the boundary layer a scalar value is used for free flow distribution which is also a hybrid function the interaction between the transition model and the sst turbulence model occurs by modifying the main terms in the turbulence kinetic energy equation k and using an effective intermittency coefficient to generate and dissipate the turbulence kinetic energy 3 problem definition and validation the purpose of this paper was to study a full span wing with the cross section of nasa ls 1 0417 is considered near the ground surface a computational mesh with an h topology was generated around the infinite wing employing quadrilateral elements which were locally refined in terms of resolution grid size limitation and other characteristics compatible with the experimental conditions moreover the domain was extended sufficiently so that confinement effects may be neglected in the analysis and an open boundary condition pressure outlet was used in the outflow section no slip conditions were applied at all solid wall surfaces and the remaining domain borders were set to far field boundaries the upper and front boundaries are located 10 times of the aerofoil chord length the downstream boundary is also placed at a distance of 30 times of the chord from the leading edge as shown in fig 1 since the bottom boundary of the computational domain is set to the ground surface an atmospheric boundary layer is formed at adjacent distances and the atmospheric velocity profile has to be considered in the simulation it is noteworthy citing the ref djavareshkian et al 2011 the domain independence study was carried out and the best domain was obtained after several lengths for upstream and downstream and even top boundary finally the independent lengths have been chosen it is worth mentioning the same dimension of the domain was used by ref li et al 2017 and foshat 2020 this velocity profile is obtained by solving the blasius equation and a certain thickness of the boundary layer is applied at the inlet foshat 2020 he et al 2018 2019b 2019b li et al 2017 since the solution provides two velocity components the vertical component of velocity v y will be much smaller than the component of velocity in the direction of flow u y but the findings indicate that the two are related to each other hence both velocity components should be considered to eliminate the artificial effect of the pressure field in the areas close to the inlet furthermore the velocity distribution with the boundary thickness of δ 0 0 41 c at r e 1 69 10 5 is defined at the inlet boundary and the thickness of the boundary layer is changed to δ 1 0 c in the aerofoil location for the developing boundary layer on the ground surface the thickness of the target boundary layer δ 1 0 c was obtained which corresponds to r e x 1 14 10 11 r e x u x δ ν in r e 1 69 10 5 in the aerofoil section now the airfoil can move in a direction perpendicular to the ground but only keeping the condition of δ 1 0 c at the aerofoil s leading edge to avoid inverted cell volumes and high skewness in the computational mesh the least possible distance of the first cell nearest to solid walls was applied while preserving a maximum value of this wall normal length expressed in wall units close to unity as a fundamental requirement for the transitional sst approach chosen for the present investigation then the effect of meshing density around the infinite wing was investigated and the optimum number of cells was obtained so that the results were independent of the meshes as shown in fig 2 the type of meshing used is the type of organized meshing with high verticality and skewness so that the solution can be calculated with a low error rate and logical answers to ensure the accuracy of the simulation and its independence from the cell numbers the lift coefficient was evaluated at α 16 and h c 1 for six meshes with a different number of cells the variation of the lift coefficient c l for different cell numbers is shown in fig 3 according to the curve trend it is clear that grid 6th is the most appropriate one in terms of accuracy and value of the computation to validate the numerical solution it is necessary to compare the present numerical solution with the experimental results published by zhang 2018 fig 4 compares the pressure coefficient distribution on the aerofoil surfaces obtained from the present work with zhang s zhang 2018 achievement fig 4 shows that the separation bubble length at free flow conditions is 3 30 c in the experimental results and 3 35 c in the numerical simulation with a small error of about 1 5 also to ensure the accuracy of the simulation process the published experimental results of free flow aerodynamic coefficients are compared with the numerical results in table 1 therefore the tiny error shows a good agreement with the experiments and proves the numerical solution s accuracy furthermore the strouhal number is calculated based on the cross stream length scale of the aerofoil ω c s i n α u equal to 0 22 this value is in excellent agreement with the previous research esmaeili and sousa 2020 foshat 2020 yarusevych et al 2009 yarusevych and boutilier 2011 whereas the strouhal number was obtained to 0 2 in the same conditions as a result the current numerical simulation indicates its ability to capture the flow field and vortex precisely behind the aerofoil it is also worth noting that when the flow regime changes and leads to the formation of a separation bubble there is a sudden and significant increase in the value of the strouhal number esmaeili and sousa 2020 nguyen and temarel 2014 placzek et al 2009 rojratsirikul et al 2011 zaman and potapczuk 1989 4 results and discussion the result of this paper leads to the lsb representing the dead air region on an aerofoil naturally forms on the upper surface of infinite and finite wings especially in pre stall angles in the range of critical reynolds number since the fluid particle s momentum on the suction side of the wing and fluid momentum of the flow are unsatisfactory flow separation in the laminar boundary layer has occurred and the intermittency coefficient has gradual growth with the bubble the process of formation and growth of lsb resulting from numerical modeling is shown in fig 5 in this figure the fluid flow with a reynolds number of 1 69 10 5 passes around the nasa ls 1 0417 aerofoil and particles of the fluid passing through the front curve of the aerofoil experienced a noticeable decrease in velocity as a result these fluctuations cause shear stress in the upper layers of the flow and lead to the emergence of contrary flow with negative velocity gradients in the laminar boundary layer and the flow levitates from the surface subsequently a low pressure region is generated by the flow separation and shear stress in the upper layers is transferred particles with higher momentum into the separated area therefore the momentum injected into the boundary layer causes the reattaching of the separated flow and once more the velocity gradient changes to zero and an lsb forms the length of the bubble and its properties are also related to the shape geometry attack angle flow velocity and the reverse pressure gradient hence various incidence angles of 8 12 14 and 16 are investigated in this study with different ground clearance firstly the behavior and characteristics of the flow away from the ground are considered then proximity to the ground and its effect on the aerofoil performance are examined in the mentioned conditions as mentioned in the last figure separation of the laminar boundary layer on the suction side of the aerofoil is accompanied by a separated shear layer leading to the formation of a uniform region in the pressure coefficient distribution this behavior can then be seen in fig 6 which shows the time averaged pressure coefficient distribution on the airfoil surfaces for different incidence angles from 8 to 16 and the attack angles can compare the bubbles lengths the onset of the separation region starts a distance x c 0 05 from the leading edge and creates a region with an almost constant pressure level in the range of 0 05 x c 0 15 however the separated flow returns to the surface by injecting high momentum flow inside the bubble and the pressure coefficient reduces again by comparing the constant pressure level length for different angles the bubble length is increased by a higher attack angle and a small bubble causes an increase in the pressure coefficient at the stagnation point in other words a long bubble has less thickness and the practical geometry of the aerofoil has a smaller thickness then this bubble results in fewer influences on stagnation pressure accordingly growing the aoas are led to importing higher momentum particles inside the bubble reduces the length of the bubble however this trend prevails in a state that the aerofoil is located far from the ground 4 1 interaction of laminar separation bubble and ground clearance three different attack angles as 8 12 and 16 and various distances from the ground surface 0 1 h c 2 are chosen to study the influence of ground distance on forming the lsb initially the effect of distance from the ground on the aerodynamic coefficients is investigated at specific angles relies on the knowledge obtained from background literature survey on ground effect phenomena the lift coefficient is increased by closing aerofoil to the ground surface and the drag force is also decreased when the reynolds number is higher than the critical range as yet there are no formed bubbles on the suction surface of the aerofoil furthermore aerodynamic studies of ground effects in the past have shown that as the distance from the surface decreases the lifting force goes high and drag force always drops down in contrast in the critical reynolds range the aerodynamic behavior demonstrates a non linear trend especially near the ground surfaces and the flow field s physics is changed when the bubbles are generated on the aerofoil surface and show different behaviors as shown in fig 7 by closing to the ground surface the lift coefficient is plummeting and then surges sharply and subsequently the inverse of this behavior has been observed on the drag coefficient the drag coefficient has an upward trend in the distance h c from away the wall to 0 5 however with a further reduction of this distance the drag coefficient begins to shedding sharply which shows a different experience of the ground effect such a non linear pattern can also be seen as a critical parameter in flight design and control approaches in the c l c d ratio in fig 8 this figure illustrates several physical behaviors in the range of 0 1 h c 2 in the fluid flow the curve has a strongly negative slope in the range of 0 5 h c 0 9 and takes a positive trend in the range of 0 1 h c 0 5 to be specific this ratio is approximately equal to 9 73 for h c 2 while by reducing the space from the long distance of the surface to h c 0 5 the ratio reaches 3 55 with a decrease of 178 08 however if the distance from the surface is still reduced up to h c 0 1 this coefficient reaches a value of c l c d 21 6 which shows a growth of 508 compared to the h c 0 5 this non linear behavior observed in aerodynamic coefficients a sharp decrease at specific distances from the ground remarks a flow pattern like large separation and stall phenomena for this purpose the average streamwise velocity distribution for different h c ratios per 16 as attack angle is shown in fig 9 for h c 1 separation does not cover the entire upper surface of the aerofoil however by reducing the distance from the surface to h c 0 5 the starting point of separation is transferred to the leading edge and a widespread separation at the suction side of the aerofoil is formed which indicates the occurrence of the stall in this condition with a further reduction of the distance from the ground more complex flow patterns are observed so that the streamwise velocity drops down in the lower surface of the aerofoil and the fluid flow is imprisoned in the gap between the aerofoil and ground surfaces fig 8c therefore the pressure increases in this region and pumps the flow on the upper surface which causes a growth in the fluid flow momentum consequently the high energetic flow can push the separation to the trailing edge and delay the flow separation as a result the lift coefficient is significantly improved and the drag coefficient is reduced the lsb also influences the trapped air between aerofoil and ground and this effect can obviously be found on the distribution of the averaged shear stress on the airfoil s upper surface in various ground clearness as shown in fig 10 in the presence of the bubble a jump occurs in the shear stress at the lsb location in the case of h c 1 5 ℎ c a large peak in shear stress can be seen in this figure but the shear stress declines sharply when the gap between the aerofoil and ground reduces to 0 75 c in this case the bubble is pressurized by the air trap in the gap and the lsb is forced to burst moreover a big separation is formed like as seen in fig 9 b however by reducing the h c to a lower value h c 0 1 the pressure of fluid flow in the mentioned gap is increased and pushes the separation point on the upper surface of the aerofoil downstream furthermore the length of the transition zone is initially reduced by decreasing the gap distance h c and then an increase in the transition zone length observes which indicates the accelerated fluid flow and delay in the turbulence process respectively the minimum value of time averaged x wall shear stress on the suction side is also demonstrated in fig 11 for different ground clearance as h c passes from 1 to lower values a sharp increase in shear stress occurs which is accompanied by thinning of the boundary layer at the point of minimum stress thence the lsb at the upper surface of the aerofoil bursts due to the velocity gradient enhancement and the boundary layer becomes thinner nevertheless the flow particles on the surface of the aerofoil in a small distance h c around 0 25c obtain more energy as a result of the ground effect phenomenon and the flow on the surface of the aerofoil is attached which causes to increase in the amount of averaged wall shear stress moreover the downwash flow behind the aerofoil is influenced by ground proximity and the trapped air between the aerofoil and the ground surface this effect can be observed in the time series of lift and drag coefficients curves the variation of the aerodynamic coefficients based on the dimensionless time t u c is depicted in fig 12 a b and c for different ground clearness for h c 0 1 the flow oscillation behind the aerofoil is reduced and the period of aerodynamic coefficients becomes bigger than that of in h c 0 5 and 1 5 at distances proximate to the ground surface the flow mechanism between the aerofoil and the ground is similar to that of the nozzle s convergent flow as the distance from the surface increases this flow behavior disparages for instance the behavior of the average value of aerodynamic coefficients becomes completely non linear by moving away from the ground the formation of an lsb influences this process indeed when the distance from the surface reduces a separation bubble forms on the suction side eventually as it approaches the ground the lsb is affected by the enhancement in pressure this occurrence causes the bubble to burst consequently at h c 0 5 the flow separation begins from the leading edge a reduction in the value of the lift coefficient and the growth of the drag demonstrate such a significant separation as it were increasing the amplitude of oscillations of aerodynamic coefficient h c 1 compared to h c 0 5 indicates a dip in the amount of central pressure of vortices and their strengthening such demeanor lessens the interaction of the trapped flow between the aerofoil and the ground on the suction side this behavior can be clearly observed in the frequency domain by the fourier transformation of the vertical component of instantaneous velocity the oscillating frequency of the flow for different distances from the surface 0 1 0 75 and 1 5 can be obtained at points behind the trailing edge as demonstrated in fig 13 this point is also obviously important because in addition to the aerofoil it is affected by the ground effect this point emphasis on the importance of this probe location the resonance frequency for all three distances is 7 4 13 5 and 17 6 h z respectively likewise this value for the case far from the ground is equal to 19 9 h z they indicate that the vortex shedding frequency is grown by the increase of ground clearness distance on the other hand far from the ground gives a chance for the vortex structure to be grown up and fluctuated easily near the ground surface the developed boundary layer on the ground can disturb the vortex structure formed behind the aerofoil and reduce the frequency of vortices to illustrate the complexities of flow patterns and the behavior of vortices during the temporal signals the phase portraits system introduced by perry et al chong et al 1990 perry and chong 1987 perry and fairlie 1975 is utilized these curves are a worthwhile tool for response analysis and determine the energy transformation of vortices on spatio temporal changes the curve is depicted by the local velocity components m s streamwise velocity u as a horizontal axis and vertical velocity v as a vertical axis at a specific point during the time it is worth noting that the rotation and arrangement of phase portraits represent the flow state from regular to turbulent in general these curves move clockwise in a finite cycle if moving in a repetitive closed path in these curves the oscillations of the vortices can be recognized periodically in a finite cycle in fig 14 phase portraits of the flow are shown for different h c 0 1 0 5 and 1 in the wake at x y 2 h 0 04 in fig 14 a several closed areas can be found with irregular patterns and several interactions however in a case close to the ground h c 0 1 the vortices downstream of the aerofoil are merged to a part of the boundary layer separated from the ground surface and irregular patterns are formed in the vortices arrangement as shown in fig 14 a this process changes with increasing distance from the ground and gradually gives way to more organized structures as the aerofoil takes some space from the ground h c 0 5 the sub harmonic behavior gives way to pure sinusoidal patterns hence according to fig 14 b features such as the periodic and uniform amplitude of time signals and ordinary and elliptical shapes are illustrated at h c 0 5 at farther distances h c 1 when the separation bubble forms irregular patterns reappear the enhancement in the amplitude of the force signals fluctuation in fig 12 is an interpretation of this claim with the appearance of a bubble on the airfoil s suction side the poincare section appears in the circular phase portraits see the inset of fig 14 c these events demonstrate changes in the behavior of vortices at various intervals for h c 1 there is a separation bubble on the suction side of the aerofoil which manipulates the flow patterns and vortex structure this trend is caused across the phase portrait curve as shown in fig 14 c this cross point named poincare indicates a change in the behavior of vortices and their irregular patterns in the downstream flow field furthermore the appearance of poincare in the phase portrait curve designates an increase in the oscillation amplitude of force time history as depicted in fig 12 c by looking at fig 14 d the periodic behavior of the time signals corresponds to closed curve orbits in the phase portrait diagrams it is worth noting at the pre stall regime here is a o a 16 the signals are almost monochromatic so that the orbits are almost circular more on that this curve has a regular shape due to not being affected by the ground effect in addition due to the formation of a lsb in the suction side the poincare section also appears which here indicates the local minimum velocity this confirms the existence of an lsb and a local increase in the adverse pressure gradient as a result according to fig 12 which contains a range of oscillations and temporal tracking of periodic oscillations it is possible to recognize a discrete natural frequency of vortex shedding he et al 2018 placzek et al 2009 which is in a way derived from the periodic motion of vortices in a finite oscillating cycle the lsb and ground proximity influence the width of the vortex downstream of the aerofoil the averaged velocity profile normalized by streamwise velocity from the ground until a vertical distance of 1 5c is demonstrated in fig 15 for various ground proximity as shown in this figure by closing the aerofoil to the ground surface from h c 1 to h c 0 1 the thickness of the ground boundary layer δ 0 is gradually reduced by around 86 this figure also shows that the maximum fraction of total pressure η and the width of the vortices ξ w c due to the presence of the ground will be such that by placing the aerofoil at the distances of 1 0 75 0 25 0 1 and also far from the ground case as reported in table 2 subsequently the vortex width becomes bigger around 21 from h c 1 to 0 75 which shows bursting bubble there to better comprehend the compromise between the ground effect and the separation bubble the root mean square rms profile of velocity fluctuations u r m s can be used the r m s profile is defined according to equation 1 n i 1 n u 2 these profiles represent a quantity based on the mean deviation between the instantaneous velocity component and the mean velocity it is worth noting that they are normalized based on the streamwise velocity and drawn according to the vortices range fig 16 reveals the r m s velocity profile normalized by the streamwise velocity at different h c profiles have two distinct principal peaks originating from the upper and lower surface of the aerofoil and represent the shear layers cores in laminar regions the peaks are symmetric such as h c 0 1 1 otherwise asymmetric peaks are formed other h c the asymmetry of the peaks stems from vortices of varying magnitude downstream also changes in distance between the peaks and their midline the dashed line in the figure are introduced as the laminar sublayer s thickness the turbulence intensity profoundly influences the laminar sublayer thickness and the situation of peak formation when the airfoil is in the position of 0 5 h c 1 the turbulence intensity is maximum about 0 2u due to the large flow separation on the other hand at h c 1 and h c 0 1 where the flow is attached to the surface the turbulence intensity declines in this regard at h c 0 25 0 75 the turbulence intensity and the laminar sublayer thickness decrease and increase respectively whereas at h c 1 0 1 the turbulence intensity increases and the laminar sublayer thickness diminish these discrepancies lead to changes in the arrangement of the peaks since the lsb length changes by different incidence angles so it is noteworthy to study the interaction of ground proximity at various attack angles in this section the ground clearance effect on lsb behavior is mentioned at attack angles of 8 12 and 16 in this regard fig 17 manifests the sharp oscillation of the lift and drag coefficient curve of the 16 degree angle pre stall at different rates of h c at this angle the flow passing on the aerofoil experiences separation in the 0 25 ℎ c 1 5 and reattachment to the surface in h c 0 25 however moving away from the pre stall regime here at 8 and 12 degree angles these curves have a gradual and gentle trend variations in the lower angles indicate the instability of the bubbles formed on the suction side these changes indicate an enlargement of the bubble by changing the angle from 8 to 12 it should be noted that the range of changes at angle of 12 is much smaller than at 8 and 16 this behavior is related to alterations in the size of the bubble thickness formed in general it can be acknowledged that the effect of ground clearance is more noticeable in a flow that is closer to stall conditions conversely variations in aerodynamic coefficients will be more severe according to the results of the adjacency to the ground on the aerodynamic coefficients at different angles the maximum efficiency can be assigned to h c 0 1 when the aerofoil is placed close to the ground h c 0 1 the passing flow is very shaky while maintaining the surface s flow connection altering the aoa the pattern and behavior of the flow on the aerofoil and the ground surface undergo significant changes dimensional vorticity field distribution is used to express the effect of changing the aoa the behavior of the vorticity field indicates the arrangement of the vortices on the other hand the lifting force is strongly related to the distribution of the flow on the aerofoil which according to stokes theory is equal to the integral of the vorticity field on the fluid s amplitude for this purpose fig 18 presents schemes of the time average distribution of the vorticity field at h c 0 1 for angles of 8 12 and 16 as a whole the vorticity field has negative and positive values for the suction and pressure sides respectively durante et al 2017 2020 the two shear layers represent the flow arrangement on the suction and pressure side flow arrangement as shown in this figure they clearly show the complete dependence of the vortices produced in the flow field on the ground clearance it is worth noting that at constant intervals kelvin helmholtz s instabilities depend on changes in aoa due to the lack of kelvin helmholtz instability at low aoas here 8 the flow is connected to the aerofoil s surface the movement of the shear layers is without any separation in these aoas vortices develop only in the far field without a significant effect on aerodynamic forces such an arrangement of flow is the same power and energy of the local particles that prevail in both the suction and pressure sides reciprocally the uniform and parallel movement of the shear layers is evident downstream of the full span wing in contrast with increasing angle of attack here 12 kelvin helmholtz instabilities increase sharply in this case the complex patterns of vorticity that originate from the vortex core are approximately intense as the aoa gain the shear layers of the flow on the suction side is separating the upper layers tend to move upward from the vorticity by forming a local structure besides a reconnection occurs after the initial separation on the suction side but due to the shear layer s sudden presence from the pressure side this process will not remain stable in this case while the shear layers are unstable the von kármán vortex s onset is also evident therefore the flow tends to pass from the pressure side to the suction side but factors such as the local flow velocity and particle energy in the suction side prevent such a process reciprocally the vortices width increases and the shear layers in their vortex spots are organized in a more elongated shape and a different rotational direction such behavior is more drastic and tangible in the pre stall regions here 16 when a periodic and constant regime is reached after passing the transition phase the fourier transform occurs in a time window its signals may even be assumed to be periodic in contrast when the signals are entirely turbulent a wider window is needed for spectral analysis here the first condition prevails in other words here the oscillation and development of vortices formed by the presence of aerofoils are strongly affected by the ground effect this process is accompanied by the integration of vortices with the boundary layer separated from the ground the power spectral density curve relative to the strouhal number is a beneficial tool for making such a claim as shown in fig 18 changes in psd relies on st can be observed due to the peak point in this group of curves higher values are obtained by increasing the formed vortices interaction in other words at low aoas here 8 and 12 spectral analysis reveals a distinct peak corresponding to the resonant frequency of the vortex shedding in contrast with enhancing angle of attack here 16 the intensity and number of frequency peaks increases such an event illustrates an increase in the vortices integration and interaction formed at 16 relative to angles 8 and 12 furthermore in a general comparison between the changes in the flow pattern at angles of 8 and 12 it can be pointed out that by reducing the h c rate from 1 5 to 0 5 the thickness of the formed bubble is reduced and its length is increased however this condition lost its dominance by decreasing the distance to because the pressure gradient from the proximity to the ground affected the flow around the aerofoil and as the flow momentum in the shear layer increased the lsb shrinks in terms of length and thickness and the longitudinal changes of the separation bubble in the pressure coefficient curves and velocity distribution contours are well illustrated in figs 11 and 12 5 conclusion in the present work a detailed investigation of the aerodynamics characteristic of nasa ls 1 0417 aerofoils of various angels of attack and ground clearance was conducted at a r e 1 69 10 5 it was found from the past literature survey and in line with that present investigation that flying in the critical reynolds range is associated with thought provoking phenomena on the other hand placing the flying object in the vicinity of the ground adds to the complexity of the pattern and the physics of the flow in this study variations and characteristics of separation bubbles in the adjacency of the ground were discussed the important conclusions of recent work are as follow the presence of a separation bubble at the infinite wing s surface eliminates the positive effect of the ground effect this trend continues until the h c rate is reduced to about 0 1 at h c 0 2 it receives additional energetic flow and maintains its connection on the suction side of the aerofoil from the inception portion of the leading edge indeed the resonance frequency decreases around 58 by reducing the rate of h c 1 to 0 1 this frequency reduction indicates the limitation of the space needed to grow vortex it is worth noting that in h c 0 2 while reducing the rate of resonant frequency the core of the vortex becomes stronger by approaching the surface c l increases by about 22 and the c d decreases around 51 this trend illustrates the ground effect s way of overcoming on low h c formed bubbles the formation and behavior of vortices in the flow field are wholly affected by the rate of h c the frequency of vortices declines with decreasing h c while their core becomes stronger by reducing the ratio of h c 1 to h c 1 due to the increase in pressure influenced by ground effect the bubble formed on the suction side grows dimensionally occasionally at h c 0 9 bubbles burst and flow completely get separated from the surface however by further reduction of the distance from the surface h c 0 2 the ground effect gets predominant and by increasing the energy of the particles in the suction area and consequently decline adverse pressure gradient adheres the flow to the surface by locating the flying object adjacent to the ground complexities such as poincare sections appear in the phase portraits circuit at 0 2 h c 1 the phase portrait curves have an elliptical shape due to the bursting of the separation bubble likewise for the case far from the ground the signals are almost monochromatic so that the orbits are almost circular according to the velocity profiles the changes x and y in the range h c 1 and h c 0 2 have a similar trend the existence of a separation bubble influences this event as the aoa decreases the separation bubble gradually disappears in this case changes in aerodynamic coefficients at different h c are negligible such insights can lead to much knowledge of the aerodynamics of the ground effect on micro aerial vehicles and other flying objects in nature

20239,inspiring from nature flying near the ground surface might increase the aerodynamic performance of micro aerial vehicles mavs because of the being small in size these birds have low flight speeds and their operating range is in the low reynolds flow zone r e 2 0 10 5 where a laminar separation bubble lsb normally appears on the suction surface of a wing in this study the interaction of lsb formed on a full span wing with the cross section of nasa ls 1 0417 and ground clearance is investigated at the critical reynolds number 5 10 4 2 10 5 the behavioral changes of the separation bubbles in free flow and near the ground surface have been numerically discussed in detail by different distances away from the ground h c and various angle of attack 8 12 14 and 16 furthermore the patterns and behavior of multiple flows affected by the interaction of the separation bubble phenomenon with ground effect is discussed from the points of view of vortex fields phase portrait frequency analysis existing stresses and velocity profiles the main outcomes reveal that the ground effect s general role does not work in this region of flow and the aerodynamic performance of the full span wing is decreased near the ground due to the bubbles furthermore at 0 2 h c 1 the phase portrait curves have an elliptical shape due to the bursting of the separation bubble graphical

used in most services and various missions including urban and biological commercial and industrial applications to prevent human and environmental losses in turn this has led to an increase in demand from industries related to the construction of unmanned micro air vehicles these flyers are small in size compared to other aircraft and due to their small size and low flight speed they usually have aerodynamic problems among other things their aerodynamic performance is highly influenced by flight conditions and its regime because of the being small in size these birds have low flight speeds and their operating range is in the low reynolds flow zone r e 2 0 10 5 esmaeili et al 2018 sunada et al 2000 winslow et al 2018 the flyers aerodynamic performance and the flow of physics in the reynolds range as mentioned earlier undergo drastic changes and the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil suddenly declines sharply esmaeili et al 2018 this means that mavs flying in this area will face many problems which indicates the importance of further study in this area to improve the flight quality of mavs what reduces the performance of lifting surfaces in this flight area is the presence of a laminar boundary layer and its tendency to detach from the surface and form a separation bubble of a laminar boundary layer even at a low incidence angle which was investigated by m s genç genç et al 2018 d j pines pines and bohorquez 2006 and w zhang zhang and samtaney 2016 over the past decade many kinds of research were done to understand this phenomenon physics and behavior for instance hansen et al 2011 investigated the effect of a passive flow control method to prevent stall occurrence they showed that the flow with reynolds 1 2 10 5 is associated with bubbles separated in the laminar boundary layer which harms the aerofoil s performance they also observed that the lift coefficient in the pre and post stall regime depends on the airfoil s geometry and the appearance of bubbles on its surface leads to significant deformation of the airfoil and is able to neutralize the effects of the control method used by them yang et al 2007 also found that to control this undesirable phenomenon it is necessary to know this phenomenon s characteristics including length thickness and the factors affecting them they showed that by changing the angle of attack aoa the separation bubble s length was more affected by the conditions the bubble s length decreases by about 20 by increasing the attack angle while the bubble thickness changes by only 1 in parallel with previous research genç ms et al genç et al 2018 also studied the effect of different aspect ratios on the separation bubble of the laminar boundary layer flowing with reynolds at 0 75 10 5 0 5 10 5 and 0 25 10 5 for aspect ratios ar of 1 and 3 their results indicate that by reducing the ar the length of the bubble formed is shorter due to the tip vortex flow and the three dimensional effects of the flow however they showed that the lsb in cruise flight mode without considering any interaction with other aerodynamic phenomena leads to decreased lift force increased drag vibration turbulence and air vehicle instability on the other hand due to the low endurance flight mavs have many landings during a mission and due to their small size they will usually operate at a close distance to the surfaces such as the ground and walls therefore ground effect phenomena play an essential role in the performance of small flyers and the appearance of an lsb on their wings can stimulate it positively or negatively of course the ground effect and its aerodynamic impacts on flyers wings have been solely considered for many years many numerical and experimental studies have been performed on this phenomenon especially in reynolds number above the critical range among them it can be referred to the work of he wei et al he et al 2019b who studied the non modal linear stability around the naca 4415 aerofoil near the ground surface at low reynolds numbers and high attack angles research by gene li et al 2017 and foshat 2020 also examined flow separation on an inclined plate and acknowledged that the ground s surface could play a vital role in the flow s structure the desired geometry in this regard zhai x et al zhai et al 2020 like he et al 2019a have numerically simulated naca 4415 airfoil at r e 200 in high aoa 18 by the effect of different types of stationary grounds they understood that increasing the undulation amplitude h 0 of the ground ends up to a higher lift coefficient increasing h 0 was found to decrease the growth rates and frequencies of the kelvin helmholtz and stationary modes which illustrate that the spanwise periodicity length of the leading stationary disturbances in the wake of an aerofoil is in order of two times of chord lengths for more precise investigation di ilio g et al di ilio et al 2018 experimented on naca 0012 in low reynolds number and different aoa they realized vortex shedding regime starts at reynolds at 1000 and 8 aoa they also found the critical aoa would be 26 for which the stall phenomenon occurs also they pinpointed the significant effect of vortices on the shear stress distribution and the efficacy of plate to ground distance on flow acceleration besides djavareshkian et al examined the two dimensional djavareshkian et al 2011 and three dimensional mehraban and djavareshkian 2020 numerical simulations of a wing in the ground s presence and studied the effect of the smart airfoil near the surface at reynolds 0 24 10 5 umar et al umar and sun 2018 then investigated the numerical simulation of the ground effect interaction in drones flap motion at low reynolds flows within the range of 10 5 to 3 10 5 the effect of diffusion of vortices from the wing s trailing edge and the growth of the boundary layer formed on the ground surface was also studied experimentally and numerically by lu et al 2016 however the surface effect can be seen in the design of formula one racing machines the wings mounted on formula one cars were studied by robert et al roberts et al 2016 2019 in 2016 changing the reynolds number from 1 63 10 5 to 2 44 10 5 for a zero degree attack angle was studied still the study showed no evidence of bubble and its effect on the vehicle s aerodynamic performance aftab et al 2016 djavareshkian and esmaeli 2011 2012 2011 esmaeili 2012 kurtulus 2018 in the meantime ahmed m r ahmed 2005 has numerically investigated naca 4415 airfoil at various aoa and the ground clearance he has discovered that there would be a strong suction effect on the lower surface at low aoa zero to 2 5 furthermore reducing ground clearance would lead to an increase in in the lift force more on that decreasing the pressure drag will have strong component in the negative drag direction increasing the aoa to 10 would make the adverse pressure gradient occur also they have found that increasing the aoa leads to high value pressure coefficient on the pressure side with broaden high pressure territory till the trailing edge of the aerofoil ahmed and sharma 2005 however during the last decade research has been conducted on the landing of mini aerial vehicles and the effect of disturbances and environmental phenomena on the landing phase has been studied huh and shim 2010 nevertheless there is a scarcity of studies on the flight close to the ground especially in the critical reynolds number flows which is more challenging and high complexities of flow physics analysis due to lsbs in spite of all this study is focused on the interaction of lsbs formed on the full span wing type of flying micro aerial vehicles with ground clearness therefore an aerofoil is considered for different attack angles on which the laminar bubble is formed at distances away from the surface by reducing the aerofoil s height from the surface the changes made to this bubble are analyzed due to the low speed of micro aerial vehicles and their small size the considered reynolds is equal to 1 69 10 5 which is in the critical reynolds range firstly this paper evaluates the effects of the vicinity of the surface on the length and thickness of the laminar bubble secondly it investigates the behavior of the flow frequency changes in such situations of presence and absence of lsb existence these interactions have also been considered by their effects on the structure of vortices phase portraits and flow vibrational energy 2 equations governing flow and numerical modeling the governing equations of fluid flow are the equation of mass conservation momentum and scalar quantity all of which can be derived from the navier stokes equations djavareshkian and esmaeili 2013 these equations are numerically discretized through the finite volume method and then applied to all volume controls based on gaussian theory the convection flux is calculated by the central difference method and the displacement flux is calculated by the second order upwind difference method finally by solving the discrete equations based on the pressure based method and relies on the simple algorithm the governing flow field can be obtained also the solver used in this research is a high order solver which called monotonic upstream centered scheme for conservation laws musl so that the simulations can be tracked with high accuracy the solution process was considered transient on the other hand it tries to improve the stability range and discretization accuracy with the help of the dual time step algorithm in such a way that in each time step a certain number of internal iterations are used to achieve a certain amount of convergence this strategy generally helps to control severe gradients along with calculating their exact values optimally however the time integration was performed by employing a second order accurate implicit method to alleviate numerical stability restrictions the time step used in every simulation reported herein was 0 0004 although this value has been halved at a preliminary stage with the objective of confirming time step independence the simulations often had to be carried out longer than 40 s to reach a statistically converged unsteady state unaffected by initial transients time averaged results were typically computed from 400 instantaneous realizations of the flow covering about 10 s of simulation time to achieve the correct and real solution one of the critical elements in the numerical solution of fluid flow along with mesh generation and flow discretization algorithm is modeling turbulent flows due to the physical nature of the turbulence a great deal of information is needed to provide a desirable model hence relies on the physics of the problem in the present study the most appropriate turbulence model is the k ω shear stress transition sst turbulence model with two additional transfer equations for accurate prediction of the transition zone qu et al 2015 rostamzadeh et al 2017 in fact following the proposition of menter and langtry langtry and menter 2009 menter et al 2006 the k ω s s t turbulence model is combined with two transfer equations for intermittency γ and momentum thickness transfer start r e θ t respectively this model is commonly known as the transition sst model the transfer equation for intermittency is as follows 1 ρ γ t ρ u γ μ μ t γ p γ e γ where e γ is a destruction relaminarization source and p γ describes the transition sources the generated practical terms are applied to this equation to consider the length of the transition zone and its start the generated practical terms are also applied to this equation to consider the length of the transition zone and its start these terms operate based on the critical value of the local reynolds number in which intermittency begins to increase at the boundary layer the second parameter is the length of the transition zone which in turn is a function of the beginning of the transition in the local reynolds number and is calculated as a scalar transfer term using the following equation 2 re θ t t ure θ t 2 μ μ t re θ t p θ t where p θ t is basically derived from the difference between the transferred value and its local value and is considered as an additional experimental relation however to remove this term in the boundary layer a scalar value is used for free flow distribution which is also a hybrid function the interaction between the transition model and the sst turbulence model occurs by modifying the main terms in the turbulence kinetic energy equation k and using an effective intermittency coefficient to generate and dissipate the turbulence kinetic energy 3 problem definition and validation the purpose of this paper was to study a full span wing with the cross section of nasa ls 1 0417 is considered near the ground surface a computational mesh with an h topology was generated around the infinite wing employing quadrilateral elements which were locally refined in terms of resolution grid size limitation and other characteristics compatible with the experimental conditions moreover the domain was extended sufficiently so that confinement effects may be neglected in the analysis and an open boundary condition pressure outlet was used in the outflow section no slip conditions were applied at all solid wall surfaces and the remaining domain borders were set to far field boundaries the upper and front boundaries are located 10 times of the aerofoil chord length the downstream boundary is also placed at a distance of 30 times of the chord from the leading edge as shown in fig 1 since the bottom boundary of the computational domain is set to the ground surface an atmospheric boundary layer is formed at adjacent distances and the atmospheric velocity profile has to be considered in the simulation it is noteworthy citing the ref djavareshkian et al 2011 the domain independence study was carried out and the best domain was obtained after several lengths for upstream and downstream and even top boundary finally the independent lengths have been chosen it is worth mentioning the same dimension of the domain was used by ref li et al 2017 and foshat 2020 this velocity profile is obtained by solving the blasius equation and a certain thickness of the boundary layer is applied at the inlet foshat 2020 he et al 2018 2019b 2019b li et al 2017 since the solution provides two velocity components the vertical component of velocity v y will be much smaller than the component of velocity in the direction of flow u y but the findings indicate that the two are related to each other hence both velocity components should be considered to eliminate the artificial effect of the pressure field in the areas close to the inlet furthermore the velocity distribution with the boundary thickness of δ 0 0 41 c at r e 1 69 10 5 is defined at the inlet boundary and the thickness of the boundary layer is changed to δ 1 0 c in the aerofoil location for the developing boundary layer on the ground surface the thickness of the target boundary layer δ 1 0 c was obtained which corresponds to r e x 1 14 10 11 r e x u x δ ν in r e 1 69 10 5 in the aerofoil section now the airfoil can move in a direction perpendicular to the ground but only keeping the condition of δ 1 0 c at the aerofoil s leading edge to avoid inverted cell volumes and high skewness in the computational mesh the least possible distance of the first cell nearest to solid walls was applied while preserving a maximum value of this wall normal length expressed in wall units close to unity as a fundamental requirement for the transitional sst approach chosen for the present investigation then the effect of meshing density around the infinite wing was investigated and the optimum number of cells was obtained so that the results were independent of the meshes as shown in fig 2 the type of meshing used is the type of organized meshing with high verticality and skewness so that the solution can be calculated with a low error rate and logical answers to ensure the accuracy of the simulation and its independence from the cell numbers the lift coefficient was evaluated at α 16 and h c 1 for six meshes with a different number of cells the variation of the lift coefficient c l for different cell numbers is shown in fig 3 according to the curve trend it is clear that grid 6th is the most appropriate one in terms of accuracy and value of the computation to validate the numerical solution it is necessary to compare the present numerical solution with the experimental results published by zhang 2018 fig 4 compares the pressure coefficient distribution on the aerofoil surfaces obtained from the present work with zhang s zhang 2018 achievement fig 4 shows that the separation bubble length at free flow conditions is 3 30 c in the experimental results and 3 35 c in the numerical simulation with a small error of about 1 5 also to ensure the accuracy of the simulation process the published experimental results of free flow aerodynamic coefficients are compared with the numerical results in table 1 therefore the tiny error shows a good agreement with the experiments and proves the numerical solution s accuracy furthermore the strouhal number is calculated based on the cross stream length scale of the aerofoil ω c s i n α u equal to 0 22 this value is in excellent agreement with the previous research esmaeili and sousa 2020 foshat 2020 yarusevych et al 2009 yarusevych and boutilier 2011 whereas the strouhal number was obtained to 0 2 in the same conditions as a result the current numerical simulation indicates its ability to capture the flow field and vortex precisely behind the aerofoil it is also worth noting that when the flow regime changes and leads to the formation of a separation bubble there is a sudden and significant increase in the value of the strouhal number esmaeili and sousa 2020 nguyen and temarel 2014 placzek et al 2009 rojratsirikul et al 2011 zaman and potapczuk 1989 4 results and discussion the result of this paper leads to the lsb representing the dead air region on an aerofoil naturally forms on the upper surface of infinite and finite wings especially in pre stall angles in the range of critical reynolds number since the fluid particle s momentum on the suction side of the wing and fluid momentum of the flow are unsatisfactory flow separation in the laminar boundary layer has occurred and the intermittency coefficient has gradual growth with the bubble the process of formation and growth of lsb resulting from numerical modeling is shown in fig 5 in this figure the fluid flow with a reynolds number of 1 69 10 5 passes around the nasa ls 1 0417 aerofoil and particles of the fluid passing through the front curve of the aerofoil experienced a noticeable decrease in velocity as a result these fluctuations cause shear stress in the upper layers of the flow and lead to the emergence of contrary flow with negative velocity gradients in the laminar boundary layer and the flow levitates from the surface subsequently a low pressure region is generated by the flow separation and shear stress in the upper layers is transferred particles with higher momentum into the separated area therefore the momentum injected into the boundary layer causes the reattaching of the separated flow and once more the velocity gradient changes to zero and an lsb forms the length of the bubble and its properties are also related to the shape geometry attack angle flow velocity and the reverse pressure gradient hence various incidence angles of 8 12 14 and 16 are investigated in this study with different ground clearance firstly the behavior and characteristics of the flow away from the ground are considered then proximity to the ground and its effect on the aerofoil performance are examined in the mentioned conditions as mentioned in the last figure separation of the laminar boundary layer on the suction side of the aerofoil is accompanied by a separated shear layer leading to the formation of a uniform region in the pressure coefficient distribution this behavior can then be seen in fig 6 which shows the time averaged pressure coefficient distribution on the airfoil surfaces for different incidence angles from 8 to 16 and the attack angles can compare the bubbles lengths the onset of the separation region starts a distance x c 0 05 from the leading edge and creates a region with an almost constant pressure level in the range of 0 05 x c 0 15 however the separated flow returns to the surface by injecting high momentum flow inside the bubble and the pressure coefficient reduces again by comparing the constant pressure level length for different angles the bubble length is increased by a higher attack angle and a small bubble causes an increase in the pressure coefficient at the stagnation point in other words a long bubble has less thickness and the practical geometry of the aerofoil has a smaller thickness then this bubble results in fewer influences on stagnation pressure accordingly growing the aoas are led to importing higher momentum particles inside the bubble reduces the length of the bubble however this trend prevails in a state that the aerofoil is located far from the ground 4 1 interaction of laminar separation bubble and ground clearance three different attack angles as 8 12 and 16 and various distances from the ground surface 0 1 h c 2 are chosen to study the influence of ground distance on forming the lsb initially the effect of distance from the ground on the aerodynamic coefficients is investigated at specific angles relies on the knowledge obtained from background literature survey on ground effect phenomena the lift coefficient is increased by closing aerofoil to the ground surface and the drag force is also decreased when the reynolds number is higher than the critical range as yet there are no formed bubbles on the suction surface of the aerofoil furthermore aerodynamic studies of ground effects in the past have shown that as the distance from the surface decreases the lifting force goes high and drag force always drops down in contrast in the critical reynolds range the aerodynamic behavior demonstrates a non linear trend especially near the ground surfaces and the flow field s physics is changed when the bubbles are generated on the aerofoil surface and show different behaviors as shown in fig 7 by closing to the ground surface the lift coefficient is plummeting and then surges sharply and subsequently the inverse of this behavior has been observed on the drag coefficient the drag coefficient has an upward trend in the distance h c from away the wall to 0 5 however with a further reduction of this distance the drag coefficient begins to shedding sharply which shows a different experience of the ground effect such a non linear pattern can also be seen as a critical parameter in flight design and control approaches in the c l c d ratio in fig 8 this figure illustrates several physical behaviors in the range of 0 1 h c 2 in the fluid flow the curve has a strongly negative slope in the range of 0 5 h c 0 9 and takes a positive trend in the range of 0 1 h c 0 5 to be specific this ratio is approximately equal to 9 73 for h c 2 while by reducing the space from the long distance of the surface to h c 0 5 the ratio reaches 3 55 with a decrease of 178 08 however if the distance from the surface is still reduced up to h c 0 1 this coefficient reaches a value of c l c d 21 6 which shows a growth of 508 compared to the h c 0 5 this non linear behavior observed in aerodynamic coefficients a sharp decrease at specific distances from the ground remarks a flow pattern like large separation and stall phenomena for this purpose the average streamwise velocity distribution for different h c ratios per 16 as attack angle is shown in fig 9 for h c 1 separation does not cover the entire upper surface of the aerofoil however by reducing the distance from the surface to h c 0 5 the starting point of separation is transferred to the leading edge and a widespread separation at the suction side of the aerofoil is formed which indicates the occurrence of the stall in this condition with a further reduction of the distance from the ground more complex flow patterns are observed so that the streamwise velocity drops down in the lower surface of the aerofoil and the fluid flow is imprisoned in the gap between the aerofoil and ground surfaces fig 8c therefore the pressure increases in this region and pumps the flow on the upper surface which causes a growth in the fluid flow momentum consequently the high energetic flow can push the separation to the trailing edge and delay the flow separation as a result the lift coefficient is significantly improved and the drag coefficient is reduced the lsb also influences the trapped air between aerofoil and ground and this effect can obviously be found on the distribution of the averaged shear stress on the airfoil s upper surface in various ground clearness as shown in fig 10 in the presence of the bubble a jump occurs in the shear stress at the lsb location in the case of h c 1 5 ℎ c a large peak in shear stress can be seen in this figure but the shear stress declines sharply when the gap between the aerofoil and ground reduces to 0 75 c in this case the bubble is pressurized by the air trap in the gap and the lsb is forced to burst moreover a big separation is formed like as seen in fig 9 b however by reducing the h c to a lower value h c 0 1 the pressure of fluid flow in the mentioned gap is increased and pushes the separation point on the upper surface of the aerofoil downstream furthermore the length of the transition zone is initially reduced by decreasing the gap distance h c and then an increase in the transition zone length observes which indicates the accelerated fluid flow and delay in the turbulence process respectively the minimum value of time averaged x wall shear stress on the suction side is also demonstrated in fig 11 for different ground clearance as h c passes from 1 to lower values a sharp increase in shear stress occurs which is accompanied by thinning of the boundary layer at the point of minimum stress thence the lsb at the upper surface of the aerofoil bursts due to the velocity gradient enhancement and the boundary layer becomes thinner nevertheless the flow particles on the surface of the aerofoil in a small distance h c around 0 25c obtain more energy as a result of the ground effect phenomenon and the flow on the surface of the aerofoil is attached which causes to increase in the amount of averaged wall shear stress moreover the downwash flow behind the aerofoil is influenced by ground proximity and the trapped air between the aerofoil and the ground surface this effect can be observed in the time series of lift and drag coefficients curves the variation of the aerodynamic coefficients based on the dimensionless time t u c is depicted in fig 12 a b and c for different ground clearness for h c 0 1 the flow oscillation behind the aerofoil is reduced and the period of aerodynamic coefficients becomes bigger than that of in h c 0 5 and 1 5 at distances proximate to the ground surface the flow mechanism between the aerofoil and the ground is similar to that of the nozzle s convergent flow as the distance from the surface increases this flow behavior disparages for instance the behavior of the average value of aerodynamic coefficients becomes completely non linear by moving away from the ground the formation of an lsb influences this process indeed when the distance from the surface reduces a separation bubble forms on the suction side eventually as it approaches the ground the lsb is affected by the enhancement in pressure this occurrence causes the bubble to burst consequently at h c 0 5 the flow separation begins from the leading edge a reduction in the value of the lift coefficient and the growth of the drag demonstrate such a significant separation as it were increasing the amplitude of oscillations of aerodynamic coefficient h c 1 compared to h c 0 5 indicates a dip in the amount of central pressure of vortices and their strengthening such demeanor lessens the interaction of the trapped flow between the aerofoil and the ground on the suction side this behavior can be clearly observed in the frequency domain by the fourier transformation of the vertical component of instantaneous velocity the oscillating frequency of the flow for different distances from the surface 0 1 0 75 and 1 5 can be obtained at points behind the trailing edge as demonstrated in fig 13 this point is also obviously important because in addition to the aerofoil it is affected by the ground effect this point emphasis on the importance of this probe location the resonance frequency for all three distances is 7 4 13 5 and 17 6 h z respectively likewise this value for the case far from the ground is equal to 19 9 h z they indicate that the vortex shedding frequency is grown by the increase of ground clearness distance on the other hand far from the ground gives a chance for the vortex structure to be grown up and fluctuated easily near the ground surface the developed boundary layer on the ground can disturb the vortex structure formed behind the aerofoil and reduce the frequency of vortices to illustrate the complexities of flow patterns and the behavior of vortices during the temporal signals the phase portraits system introduced by perry et al chong et al 1990 perry and chong 1987 perry and fairlie 1975 is utilized these curves are a worthwhile tool for response analysis and determine the energy transformation of vortices on spatio temporal changes the curve is depicted by the local velocity components m s streamwise velocity u as a horizontal axis and vertical velocity v as a vertical axis at a specific point during the time it is worth noting that the rotation and arrangement of phase portraits represent the flow state from regular to turbulent in general these curves move clockwise in a finite cycle if moving in a repetitive closed path in these curves the oscillations of the vortices can be recognized periodically in a finite cycle in fig 14 phase portraits of the flow are shown for different h c 0 1 0 5 and 1 in the wake at x y 2 h 0 04 in fig 14 a several closed areas can be found with irregular patterns and several interactions however in a case close to the ground h c 0 1 the vortices downstream of the aerofoil are merged to a part of the boundary layer separated from the ground surface and irregular patterns are formed in the vortices arrangement as shown in fig 14 a this process changes with increasing distance from the ground and gradually gives way to more organized structures as the aerofoil takes some space from the ground h c 0 5 the sub harmonic behavior gives way to pure sinusoidal patterns hence according to fig 14 b features such as the periodic and uniform amplitude of time signals and ordinary and elliptical shapes are illustrated at h c 0 5 at farther distances h c 1 when the separation bubble forms irregular patterns reappear the enhancement in the amplitude of the force signals fluctuation in fig 12 is an interpretation of this claim with the appearance of a bubble on the airfoil s suction side the poincare section appears in the circular phase portraits see the inset of fig 14 c these events demonstrate changes in the behavior of vortices at various intervals for h c 1 there is a separation bubble on the suction side of the aerofoil which manipulates the flow patterns and vortex structure this trend is caused across the phase portrait curve as shown in fig 14 c this cross point named poincare indicates a change in the behavior of vortices and their irregular patterns in the downstream flow field furthermore the appearance of poincare in the phase portrait curve designates an increase in the oscillation amplitude of force time history as depicted in fig 12 c by looking at fig 14 d the periodic behavior of the time signals corresponds to closed curve orbits in the phase portrait diagrams it is worth noting at the pre stall regime here is a o a 16 the signals are almost monochromatic so that the orbits are almost circular more on that this curve has a regular shape due to not being affected by the ground effect in addition due to the formation of a lsb in the suction side the poincare section also appears which here indicates the local minimum velocity this confirms the existence of an lsb and a local increase in the adverse pressure gradient as a result according to fig 12 which contains a range of oscillations and temporal tracking of periodic oscillations it is possible to recognize a discrete natural frequency of vortex shedding he et al 2018 placzek et al 2009 which is in a way derived from the periodic motion of vortices in a finite oscillating cycle the lsb and ground proximity influence the width of the vortex downstream of the aerofoil the averaged velocity profile normalized by streamwise velocity from the ground until a vertical distance of 1 5c is demonstrated in fig 15 for various ground proximity as shown in this figure by closing the aerofoil to the ground surface from h c 1 to h c 0 1 the thickness of the ground boundary layer δ 0 is gradually reduced by around 86 this figure also shows that the maximum fraction of total pressure η and the width of the vortices ξ w c due to the presence of the ground will be such that by placing the aerofoil at the distances of 1 0 75 0 25 0 1 and also far from the ground case as reported in table 2 subsequently the vortex width becomes bigger around 21 from h c 1 to 0 75 which shows bursting bubble there to better comprehend the compromise between the ground effect and the separation bubble the root mean square rms profile of velocity fluctuations u r m s can be used the r m s profile is defined according to equation 1 n i 1 n u 2 these profiles represent a quantity based on the mean deviation between the instantaneous velocity component and the mean velocity it is worth noting that they are normalized based on the streamwise velocity and drawn according to the vortices range fig 16 reveals the r m s velocity profile normalized by the streamwise velocity at different h c profiles have two distinct principal peaks originating from the upper and lower surface of the aerofoil and represent the shear layers cores in laminar regions the peaks are symmetric such as h c 0 1 1 otherwise asymmetric peaks are formed other h c the asymmetry of the peaks stems from vortices of varying magnitude downstream also changes in distance between the peaks and their midline the dashed line in the figure are introduced as the laminar sublayer s thickness the turbulence intensity profoundly influences the laminar sublayer thickness and the situation of peak formation when the airfoil is in the position of 0 5 h c 1 the turbulence intensity is maximum about 0 2u due to the large flow separation on the other hand at h c 1 and h c 0 1 where the flow is attached to the surface the turbulence intensity declines in this regard at h c 0 25 0 75 the turbulence intensity and the laminar sublayer thickness decrease and increase respectively whereas at h c 1 0 1 the turbulence intensity increases and the laminar sublayer thickness diminish these discrepancies lead to changes in the arrangement of the peaks since the lsb length changes by different incidence angles so it is noteworthy to study the interaction of ground proximity at various attack angles in this section the ground clearance effect on lsb behavior is mentioned at attack angles of 8 12 and 16 in this regard fig 17 manifests the sharp oscillation of the lift and drag coefficient curve of the 16 degree angle pre stall at different rates of h c at this angle the flow passing on the aerofoil experiences separation in the 0 25 ℎ c 1 5 and reattachment to the surface in h c 0 25 however moving away from the pre stall regime here at 8 and 12 degree angles these curves have a gradual and gentle trend variations in the lower angles indicate the instability of the bubbles formed on the suction side these changes indicate an enlargement of the bubble by changing the angle from 8 to 12 it should be noted that the range of changes at angle of 12 is much smaller than at 8 and 16 this behavior is related to alterations in the size of the bubble thickness formed in general it can be acknowledged that the effect of ground clearance is more noticeable in a flow that is closer to stall conditions conversely variations in aerodynamic coefficients will be more severe according to the results of the adjacency to the ground on the aerodynamic coefficients at different angles the maximum efficiency can be assigned to h c 0 1 when the aerofoil is placed close to the ground h c 0 1 the passing flow is very shaky while maintaining the surface s flow connection altering the aoa the pattern and behavior of the flow on the aerofoil and the ground surface undergo significant changes dimensional vorticity field distribution is used to express the effect of changing the aoa the behavior of the vorticity field indicates the arrangement of the vortices on the other hand the lifting force is strongly related to the distribution of the flow on the aerofoil which according to stokes theory is equal to the integral of the vorticity field on the fluid s amplitude for this purpose fig 18 presents schemes of the time average distribution of the vorticity field at h c 0 1 for angles of 8 12 and 16 as a whole the vorticity field has negative and positive values for the suction and pressure sides respectively durante et al 2017 2020 the two shear layers represent the flow arrangement on the suction and pressure side flow arrangement as shown in this figure they clearly show the complete dependence of the vortices produced in the flow field on the ground clearance it is worth noting that at constant intervals kelvin helmholtz s instabilities depend on changes in aoa due to the lack of kelvin helmholtz instability at low aoas here 8 the flow is connected to the aerofoil s surface the movement of the shear layers is without any separation in these aoas vortices develop only in the far field without a significant effect on aerodynamic forces such an arrangement of flow is the same power and energy of the local particles that prevail in both the suction and pressure sides reciprocally the uniform and parallel movement of the shear layers is evident downstream of the full span wing in contrast with increasing angle of attack here 12 kelvin helmholtz instabilities increase sharply in this case the complex patterns of vorticity that originate from the vortex core are approximately intense as the aoa gain the shear layers of the flow on the suction side is separating the upper layers tend to move upward from the vorticity by forming a local structure besides a reconnection occurs after the initial separation on the suction side but due to the shear layer s sudden presence from the pressure side this process will not remain stable in this case while the shear layers are unstable the von kármán vortex s onset is also evident therefore the flow tends to pass from the pressure side to the suction side but factors such as the local flow velocity and particle energy in the suction side prevent such a process reciprocally the vortices width increases and the shear layers in their vortex spots are organized in a more elongated shape and a different rotational direction such behavior is more drastic and tangible in the pre stall regions here 16 when a periodic and constant regime is reached after passing the transition phase the fourier transform occurs in a time window its signals may even be assumed to be periodic in contrast when the signals are entirely turbulent a wider window is needed for spectral analysis here the first condition prevails in other words here the oscillation and development of vortices formed by the presence of aerofoils are strongly affected by the ground effect this process is accompanied by the integration of vortices with the boundary layer separated from the ground the power spectral density curve relative to the strouhal number is a beneficial tool for making such a claim as shown in fig 18 changes in psd relies on st can be observed due to the peak point in this group of curves higher values are obtained by increasing the formed vortices interaction in other words at low aoas here 8 and 12 spectral analysis reveals a distinct peak corresponding to the resonant frequency of the vortex shedding in contrast with enhancing angle of attack here 16 the intensity and number of frequency peaks increases such an event illustrates an increase in the vortices integration and interaction formed at 16 relative to angles 8 and 12 furthermore in a general comparison between the changes in the flow pattern at angles of 8 and 12 it can be pointed out that by reducing the h c rate from 1 5 to 0 5 the thickness of the formed bubble is reduced and its length is increased however this condition lost its dominance by decreasing the distance to because the pressure gradient from the proximity to the ground affected the flow around the aerofoil and as the flow momentum in the shear layer increased the lsb shrinks in terms of length and thickness and the longitudinal changes of the separation bubble in the pressure coefficient curves and velocity distribution contours are well illustrated in figs 11 and 12 5 conclusion in the present work a detailed investigation of the aerodynamics characteristic of nasa ls 1 0417 aerofoils of various angels of attack and ground clearance was conducted at a r e 1 69 10 5 it was found from the past literature survey and in line with that present investigation that flying in the critical reynolds range is associated with thought provoking phenomena on the other hand placing the flying object in the vicinity of the ground adds to the complexity of the pattern and the physics of the flow in this study variations and characteristics of separation bubbles in the adjacency of the ground were discussed the important conclusions of recent work are as follow the presence of a separation bubble at the infinite wing s surface eliminates the positive effect of the ground effect this trend continues until the h c rate is reduced to about 0 1 at h c 0 2 it receives additional energetic flow and maintains its connection on the suction side of the aerofoil from the inception portion of the leading edge indeed the resonance frequency decreases around 58 by reducing the rate of h c 1 to 0 1 this frequency reduction indicates the limitation of the space needed to grow vortex it is worth noting that in h c 0 2 while reducing the rate of resonant frequency the core of the vortex becomes stronger by approaching the surface c l increases by about 22 and the c d decreases around 51 this trend illustrates the ground effect s way of overcoming on low h c formed bubbles the formation and behavior of vortices in the flow field are wholly affected by the rate of h c the frequency of vortices declines with decreasing h c while their core becomes stronger by reducing the ratio of h c 1 to h c 1 due to the increase in pressure influenced by ground effect the bubble formed on the suction side grows dimensionally occasionally at h c 0 9 bubbles burst and flow completely get separated from the surface however by further reduction of the distance from the surface h c 0 2 the ground effect gets predominant and by increasing the energy of the particles in the suction area and consequently decline adverse pressure gradient adheres the flow to the surface by locating the flying object adjacent to the ground complexities such as poincare sections appear in the phase portraits circuit at 0 2 h c 1 the phase portrait curves have an elliptical shape due to the bursting of the separation bubble likewise for the case far from the ground the signals are almost monochromatic so that the orbits are almost circular according to the velocity profiles the changes x and y in the range h c 1 and h c 0 2 have a similar trend the existence of a separation bubble influences this event as the aoa decreases the separation bubble gradually disappears in this case changes in aerodynamic coefficients at different h c are negligible such insights can lead to much knowledge of the aerodynamics of the ground effect on micro aerial vehicles and other flying objects in nature
