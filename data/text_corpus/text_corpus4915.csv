24575,effects of the reduction of submarine groundwater discharge sgd on thermal habitats for manatee in the homosassa river a spring fed estuary in florida were studied using a laterally averaged hydrodynamic model the estuary receives its hydrologic loading from numerous spring vents mainly located at its headwaters and two upstream tributaries the model was calibrated and verified against real time data collected during november 2014 august 2017 before it was used to simulate hydrodynamics salinity transport and thermal dynamics in the estuary from october 9 2007 to march 12 2018 with various sgd reductions effects of the sgd reduction on chronic 72 hour timescale and acute 4 hour timescale thermal habitats for manatee were analyzed at five critical time points ctps including those of the lowest air temperature in 2010 and 2018 the lowest water temperature the minimum thermal habitats and the most sensitive extremely low habitats it is found that the chronic thermal habitats for manatee decrease linearly with the increase of the sgd reduction at these ctps when chronic thermal habitats are extremely low they are most sensitive to the sgd reduction every 1 reduction of the sgd could cause roughly a 1 31 1 32 reduction of 20 c water volume and a 1 28 reduction of 20 c surface area the chronic thermal habitats for manatee in the homosassa river can be predicted using a simple heat flux parameter h f which explains 92 and 93 of the total variances of 20 c water volume and surface area respectively using a logarithm relationship the linearity of the relationships between the acute thermal habitats for manatee and the sgd reduction is weak in fact when acute thermal habitats in the estuary are extremely low their relationships with the sgd reduction are very nonlinear with the global minimum points varying significantly for various sgd reductions keywords submarine groundwater discharge spring fed estuary laterally averaged hydrodynamic model chronic thermal habitats for manatee acute thermal habitats for manatee 1 introduction the homosassa river is a spring fed estuary located in citrus county on the gulf coast of central florida fig 1 the river is about 13 km long from its headspring to the gulf of mexico and has a width varying from about 60 m in the upstream reach to about 305 m near the mouth yobbi and knochemus 1989 the homosassa river is a shallow waterbody with a mean water depth of approximately 1 2 m and the riverbed less than one meter deep from the mean tide level for most of the area of the estuary the estuarine system includes several tributaries and distributaries among which the southeast folk and the hall river flow to the upstream area of the homosassa river while the salt river and mason creek branch off from the main stem of the homosassa river to meet the gulf of mexico gom the estuary also has some other smaller tributaries including a channel system in the town of homosassa and the hidden river the homosassa river flows through a coastal swamps region where poorly drained and saturated organic soils overlie limestone rocks of the upper florida aquifer ufa as most of the wetland is self percolating and barely contributes any quantifiable surface water runoff the estuary receives an insignificant amount of freshwater runoff from its 145 km2watershed most of the hydrologic loading to the homosassa river comes from the ufa in the form of submarine groundwater discharge sgd out of numerous spring vents located in the headspring area and in several of its tributaries mainly the southeast fork and the halls river locations of the springs that discharge groundwater flows to the homosassa river are shown as solid dots in fig 1 the headwaters of the river are the homosassa springs and several other springs the contributing groundwater field for the spring flow discharge is subject to the shape of potentiometric surface in the region and thus varies with time depending on the precipitation pattern in the region in a similar way that the watershed for surface water runoff is delineated the contributing groundwater field or springshed is delineated based on the potentiometric contours for the spring flows entering the homosassa river the area of the springshed varies around 700 km2 with a slight year to year variation like some other estuaries along the gulf coast of florida the homosassa river estuary is under the action of microtidal forces which are primarily semidiurnal as the estuary is relatively shallow it is generally well or partially mixed the system is ecologically important for many marine species including florida manatees trichechus manatus latirostris and common snook centropomus undecimalis which use the spring fed estuaries as thermal refuges in winters because a large amount of spring water with a relatively constant temperature of about 23 0 c or higher flows to the river these marine species can have a huge economic impact on local communities in florida as they can attract millions of visitors to the sunshine state citrus county is especially famous for manatee related tourism in florida for example the headwater area of the homosassa river homosassa springs is a great destination for many tourists coming to florida to visit where one can view manatees and enjoy numerous other recreational activities snorkeling in the coastal springs and swimming with florida manatees in the homosassa river are an incredible experience which many visitors will forever cherish florida manatee is a subspecies of the west indian manatee which has been included on the us endangered species list since the 1970s to prevent the population decline the west indian manatee is protected by different federal and state laws including the marine mammal protection act of 1972 the endangered species act of 1973 and the florida manatee sanctuary act of 1978 https myfwc com conservation you conserve wildlife manatee as a result the wet indian manatee had a population increase in recent years and was reclassified from endangered to threatened in 2018 the law library 2018 under the authority of the endangered species act of 1973 nevertheless all federal protections for the west indian manatee under the endangered species act remain in place manatee protection has not only provided a great ecological value to the estuary but also benefited local communities in florida a study by solomon et al 2004 strongly supported the argument that manatee protection provides citrus county with a significant net benefit their study estimated that the net benefits of manatee protection in citrus county was approximately 8 2 9 million primarily gained through eco tourism there are only limited previous studies on effect of sgds on thermal habitats in the homosassa river estuary hsw engineering inc 2011 applied the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc originally developed by hamrick 1992 to simulate circulations salinity transport processes and thermal dynamics in the homosassa river they had to expand and deepen the downstream area of the river to form a large funnel to allow estuarine water to be transported upstream hsw engineering inc 2011 clearly this artificial alteration of the topography and bathymetry dramatically changed the shape of the estuary that was simulated and should not be made in any of hydrodynamic modeling studies model results from an estuary that has a dramatically different shape from the real estuary are meaningless as mentioned in chen 2012 most previous coastal and estuarine hydrodynamic modeling studies did not consider effects of sgds johnson et al 1991 blumberg and kim 2000 partly because sgds are much lower than river flows and precipitations for these estuaries and partly because sgds are very difficult to quantify in many cases there are only very limited estuarine and coastal hydrodynamic modeling studies which considered sgds ganju et al 2012 applied the 3d model roms warner et al 2008 to west falmouth harbor massachusetts to verify their tidal and groundwater flux estimates to the estuary based on velocity and salinity measurements estimated and considered sgds in the hydrodynamic simulations for crystal river kings bay using the 3d model unless3d to analyze thermal habitats for manatee in the estuary he found that sgds in crystal river kings is not only negatively proportional to the tides but also positively proportional to the first derivative of tides with respect to time as almost all the hydrologic loading to the homosassa river estuary comes from sgds from numerous spring vents the term flow and the term sgd are exchangeable in this paper in the following sections the laterally averaged model lamfe is briefly introduced followed by a short description of model calibration and verification against measured real time water levels salinities and temperatures at five fixed stations in the estuary during a 34 month period model simulations for a series of the sgd reduction scenarios are presented with simulated thermal habitats during a 125 month period being analyzed effects of the sgd reduction on chronic and acute thermal habitats for manatee were evaluated and discussed conclusions of the modeling study are provided at the end of the paper 2 laterally averaged hydrodynamic model because the homosassa river is a narrow and meandering estuary its circulation pattern and salinity and temperature distributions vary primarily in the vertical and longitudinal directions vertically two dimensional variations are typical for narrow estuaries prandle 1985 jay and smith 1990 chen 2004a for which the most suitable simulation tool is a laterally averaged model this study used the laterally averaged model for estuaries lamfe developed by the author for the simulation of circulations salinity transport processes and thermal dynamics in the homosassa river the lamfe model has been applied to several estuaries over the last two decades including the lower hillsborough river chen et al 2000 the lower alafia river chen 2004b the lower peace and myakka rivers chen 2007a 2008 and the lower manatee braden rivers chen 2007b the model uses the hydrostatic pressure assumption and solves the following laterally averaged governing equations 1 u b x w b z v 2 u t u u x w u z τ w x ρ 0 b g η x g ρ 0 z η ρ x d ζ 1 b x b a h u x 1 b z b a z u z 3 b c t u b c x w b c z z b b h c x z b b v b c z v c t where x is horizontal coordinate in the longitudinal direction of along the river estuary z is the vertical coordinate t is time c is concentration u and w represent velocities in x and z directions respectively v is the velocity for lateral input direct runoff tributary etc b is the width of the estuary a function of x and z ρ g and η denote density gravitational acceleration and the free surface elevation respectively τ w x represents frictions at side walls ρcwu u 2 w 2 1 2 where cw is a frictional coefficient for side walls ah and av are eddy viscosities in the x and z directions respectively bh and bv are horizontal and vertical eddy diffusivities respectively and ct represents concentration in lateral input the equation for the free surface is obtained by integrating eq 1 over the water depth 4 b η η t x h 0 η u b d z h 0 η v d z r b η where ho is the bottom elevation b η is the width of the river estuary at the free surface and r is the net rain intensity rainfall minus evaporation in cm sec 1 the lamfe model uses a cartesian grid system with a staggered arrangement of model variables pressure concentrations and density are calculated at the cell center u and w velocities are calculated at the centers of the right and top faces of the cell respectively and surface elevation is computed at the center of horizontal grid the horizontal eddy viscosity ah and diffusivity bh are calculated using the sub grid scale model of smagorinsky 1963 in the lamfe model for the estimation of the vertical eddy viscosity av and vertical eddy diffusivity bv the lamfe model provides several options including a simplified second order closure model and a turbulent kinetic energy tke model chen 1994 that is similar to that of sheng and villaret 1989 the solver of the lamfe model uses a semi implicit scheme called the free surface correction fsc method the fsc method is a predictor corrector approach that involves two steps in the first step an intermediate velocity field is solved by treating the pressure gradient term and the convection terms explicitly and treating the vertical eddy viscosity terms and bottom and sidewall frictions implicitly an intermediate free surface is found from eq 4 using the intermediate velocity field the final free surface is obtained by solving an equation of the fsc that is derived from a semi implicit treatment of the hydrostatic pressure term after the final free surface is found the final velocity field is calculated by adjusting the intermediate velocity field using the fsc the method is unconditional stable with respect to gravity waves bottom and wall frictions and the vertical eddy viscosity term in practical applications it generally allows the model to run with a courant number larger than 10 details on the fsc method and its properties can be found in chen 2003 although the z coordinate is used in the model without any transformation the model can fit the bottom variation by using a piecewise linear bottom chen 2001 the resulting grid cells are hybrid and their side views include regular cartesian grid cells and multi face cells that are cut with a piecewise linear bottom details on the use the piecewise linear bottom to fit the bed variation in lamfe are described in chen 2004a 3 model calibrations and verification for the lamfe model application the homosassa river estuary was discretized with 406 grids along the river main stem and its 21 branches to ensure that the main physical characteristics of the system can be properly resolved by the model the horizontal spacing of the grids varies between 29 and 277 m fig 2 shows cross sections that form the 406 lamfe grids along the main stem of the homosassa river and its branches in the vertical direction 15 layers were used to discretize the water column between 6 56 m navd88 and 3 0 m navd88 with the layer thickness ranging between 0 3 m and 1 76 m there were several fixed stations in the homosassa estuary at which real time data of water level salinity and temperature were collected with a 15 minute time interval these fixed stations are marked with yellow or red triangles in fig 1 with yellow triangles being stations maintained by the us geological survey usgs and red triangles by the southwest florida water management district swfwmd as shown in fig 1 the usgs fixed stations included 1 homosassa river at shell island near homosassa 02310712 2 homosassa river at homosassa 02310700 3 halls river near homosassa 02310690 4 halls river at homosassa springs 02310689 5 homosassa springs at homosassa springs 02310678 6 se fork homosassa spring at homosassa springs 02310688 and 7 hidden river near homosassa 02310675 the two swfwmd fixed stations were in the two distributaries namely the salt river and mason creek at the homosassa springs at homosassa springs station the usgs estimates the discharge through the transect using a regression equation that relates the discharge with the tides and the groundwater level in a well that is about 30 km away at the homosassa river at homosassa se fork homosassa spring at homosassa springs and halls river at homosassa springs stations the usgs used acoustic doppler current profilers adcps to measure discharges through these transects discharge data measured at these three stations contain not only sgds but also tidal fluxes passing through the cross sections these tidal fluxes were taken away from the measured discharges to find the net sgds entering the estuarine system chen 2019 2021 the lamfe model used water level salinity and temperature data at the homosassa river at shell island near homosassa salt river and mason creek stations as boundary conditions at the downstream open boundaries at the free surface wind shear stress and heat flux were specified using meteorological data collected near the estuary at the upstream cross sections of the homosassa river se fork and halls river net sgds were used as boundary conditions as salinity and temperature data in sgds from the spring vents were not available salinity and temperature boundary conditions at the upstream cross sections were estimated using a trial and error approach based on measured salinities and temperatures at the homosassa springs at homosassa springs se fork homosassa spring at homosassa springs and halls river at homosassa springs stations details about estimating salinity and temperature boundary conditions for the upstream cross sections are documented in chen 2019 based on the available data that can be used as boundary conditions to drive the model and as target values to calibrate and verify the model a 34 month period between 11 4 2014 and 8 31 2017 was chosen for model calibration and verification with the first 19 months being for model calibration and the remaining 15 months for model verification a variable time step δt between 45 and 60 s was used in model runs with δt 60 s being used about 96 of the 34 month simulation period the lamfe model for the homosassa river was calibrated against measured real time data at the usgs fixed station within the simulation domain se fork homosassa spring homosassa springs at homosassa springs halls river at homosassa spring halls river near homosassa and homosassa river at homosassa stations a few model parameters including the bottom roughness ambient vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity and light attenuation were adjusted to obtain the best match of simulated water levels salinities and temperatures and real time field data comparisons of model results with field measurements at the five measurement stations show that a very good agreement between simulated water levels salinities and temperatures and real time data can be reached for both the calibration and verification periods suggesting that the lamfe model performs very well for the homosassa river estuarine system time series plots of simulated results and field data are presented in chen 2019 2021 and thus omitted here the performance of lamfe model for the homosassa river estuary was quantified using several statistics including the mean error me mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse normalized root mean square error nrmse coefficient of determination r 2 and the skill parameter skill of willmott 1981 table 1 is a summary of these statistics for the lamfe model predictions of water level salinity and temperature the lamfe model calibration and verification processes for the homosassa river estuary were quite successful with very good performance statistics for water level salinity and temperature predictions during the entire 34 month period as can be seen from table 1 mes for the water level salinity and temperature simulations are 0 64 cm 0 00 psu and 0 14 c respectively while maes are 5 54 cm 0 46 psu and 0 66 c respectively rmses of simulated water levels salinities and temperatures are respectively 7 21 cm 0 81 psu and 0 98 c nrmses are all 0 03 for the three variables simulated while r2 values for the water level salinity and temperature predictions are respectively 0 86 0 83 and 0 93 willmott skills are 0 95 or higher for simulated water levels salinities and temperatures by the lamfe model 4 simulated thermal habitats for sgd reduction scenarios to study effects of the sgd reduction on thermal habitats a series of model simulation were conducted including the existing flow condition a baseline flow condition bfc and 12 flow reduction scenarios ranging from 2 5 to 30 reduction with a constant increment of 2 5 the bfc is an imaginary flow condition that would exist if no ground water were withdrawn in the springshed it is estimated that the existing withdrawal causes about 1 85 reduction of sgds entering the homosassa river estuary as such the baseline flow is obtained by multiplying the existing sgds with a factor of 1 1 0 0185 it is desirable to run the homosassa river lamfe model for various flow reduction conditions for as many years as possible if input data used to drive the model are available in this study the critical data needed for conducting simulations for multiple years are the downstream boundary conditions with an effort to fill gaps in measured data based on available water level salinity and temperature data in the gom not far from the mouth of the homosassa river the boundary conditions at the downstream open boundary of the simulation domain became available from october 1 2007 to early 2018 allowing a continuous simulation for 125 months or more than 10 years details on the gap filling in the downstream boundary conditions and other data which drive the lamfe model for the homosassa river can be found in chen 2019 because sgds entering the homosassa river estuary have a relatively stable temperature of about 23 0 c or higher throughout the entire year they are important thermal resources for the estuary and provide warm water refuges for some marine species such as manatees and common snook during winter times when cold fronts move to the region and cause water temperature in the gulf to be much lower than 20 c in the spring fed estuaries along the florida gulf coast manatee and snook are more abundant in the winter than summer suggesting their use of thermal habitats as warm water refuge in these water bodies manatees cannot survive in water colder than 20 c for a prolonged period with a high thermal conductance or poor insulation worthy et al 2000 manatees are not able to increase their metabolic rates in cold water to compensate the increased rate of body heat loss based on available data it was found that disastrous losses to the manatee population could occur if exposure to water below 20 c for longer than 4 7 days rouhani et al 2007 when water temperature is further drops to below 15 c manatees cannot withstand the cold for more than 4 h jei and atm 2007 in the modeling study simulated temperature fields were saved to output files with an interval of 30 min for all 14 flow scenarios these model results were processed to calculate thermal habitats for manatee including water volumes and surface areas for temperature 20 c 15 c and 20 c and 15 c as 15 c and 20 c isotherms are critical for manatee in the cold days in winter while a warm water volume that is big enough is important for manatees to stay and swim a warm surface area that is large enough is important for manatees to breath fig 3 shows time series of water volumes top panel and surface areas bottom panel for temperature 15 c 15 c and 20 c and 20 c under the bfc for comparison time series of 15 c 15 c and 20 c and 20 c thermal habits for the 10 flow reduction scenario are shown in fig 4 time series plots of thermal habitats for other flow reduction scenarios are similar and omitted here for simplicity only about one year 360 days of the simulated thermal habitats between july 13 2009 and july 7 2010 were plotted in figs 3 and 4 from figs 3 and 4 one can see that during late april through early october water volumes and surface areas for temperature 15 c as well as 15 c and 20 c are zero and there is no 20 c thermal habitats in the homosassa river in the six months during which the region is warm the air temperature generally has a daily high of 30 c in these warm months and the water temperature in the coastal area is always higher than 20 c as a result water temperature inside the homosassa river is always 20 c and the 20 c thermal habitats shown with blue lines in figs 3 and 4 represent the total water volume and the total surface area of the estuarine system during the six warm months it can be read from figs 3 and 4 that while the total water volume varies roughly around 7 5 million cubic meters the total surface area varies around 6 5 million square meters as such the average water depth in the homosassa river is about 1 15 m on the other hand december march are the coldest months of the year for the region and 15 c thermal habitats red lines in figs 3 and 4 only exist in these cold months during which 20 c thermal habitats reach the minimum in the homosassa river estuary from fig 3 it can be seen that 20 c water volume was less than 1 million m3 for most of january and february in 2010 while 20 c surface area was less than 1 5 million m2 thermal habitats for temperature 15 c varied dramatically during january and february 2010 from zero to more than 6 million m3 for water volume and from zero to about 6 million m2 for surface area thermal habitats for temperature between 15 and 20 c also varied in a very large range from zero to almost the entire estuary from figs 3 and 4 one sees that water volumes and surface areas for all temperature ranges exhibit tidal variations as expected tidal signals in water volume are much stronger than surface area the former is about 1 5 million m3 and the latter is roughly 0 25 million m2 although the tidal variation for latter is only about one sixth of the former the existence of tidal signals in simulated surface areas for various temperature ranges shows that the lamfe model automatically handles the wetting and drying phenomenon because the river width b is included in the governing equations eqs 1 3 although b is a function of x and z and not a function of time the river width at the free surface b η depends on the surface elevation and is updated every time step resulting in a time dependent surface area of the estuary 5 effects of sgd on thermal habitats for manatee because of their inability to survive in cold environment manatees that are exposure to water below 20 c for longer than 4 7 days could suffer disastrous losses rouhani et al 2007 as a result a time scale shorter than 96 h should be used in analyzing effects of sgd reduction on 20 c water volume and surface area in the homosassa river to be conservative this study followed previous studies by rouhani et al 2007 jei and atm 2007 and herrick et al 2017 and chose a time scale of 72 h in analyzing thermal habitats for temperature 20 c when water temperature drops to below 15 c the condition for manatees becomes very harsh as most young and old manatees cannot survive in water with temperature 15 c for more than four hours naturally manatees try to avoid 15 c habitats and find warmer habitats to survive in these conditions as such the existence and extension of 15 c habitats with a time scale of four hours are critical and need to be protected to minimize manatee mortality because adult manatees are big and need a dimension of 1 16 m 1 16 m 2 29 m rouhani et al 2007 to fully submerged in warm water water volumes and surface areas associated with water depth less than 1 16 m cannot be used by manatee as thermal refuge and were thus excluded in the analysis furthermore 20 c or 15 c layers less than 1 16 m thick were excluded in the calculation either in the following discussion of simulated thermal habitats for manatee this 1 16 m depth layer thickness requirement is always considered and will not be specifically mentioned in the text water volumes and surface area with temperature 20 c and a time scale of 72 h or longer are referred to as chronic thermal habitats for manatee while those with temperature 15 c and a time scale of 4 h or longer are acute thermal habitats for manatee in the analysis of chronic thermal habitats for manatee signals with a time scale less than 72 h were filtered out by taking 72 hour moving averages of simulated water volumes and surface areas for temperature 20 c similarly in the analysis of acute thermal habitats for manatee signals less 4 h were filtered out by taking 4 hour moving averages of the 15 c volumes and surface areas at any time point t in hours the chronic and acute thermal habitats for manatee were simply calculated as the arithmetic means during t 36 t 36 and t 2 t 2 respectively 5 1 chronic thermal habitats for manatee fig 5 shows 72 hour moving averages of water volume top panel and surface area bottom panel for temperature 20 c for the bfc the existing flow condition and the 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 flow reduction scenarios during the same 360 days as these in figs 3 and 4 the two inserts included in the figure provide more details of the 72 hour moving averages of these manatee thermal habitats during a 30 day period from december 26 2009 to january 24 2010 from fig 5 one can see that 72 hour moving averages of water volume and surface area for water temperature 20 c during the warm days of the year varied roughly around 7 0 million m3 and 5 5 million m2 respectively in the homosassa river during the cold days chronic thermal habitats were reduced significantly to about one order of magnitude smaller than those in the warm days as expected 72 hour moving averages are much smoother than time series of the 20 c water volume and surface area shown in figs 3 and 4 most tidal variations shown in figs 3 and 4 are filtered out by the simple low pass filter with the 72 hour window which is much longer than the periods of diurnal and semi diurnal variations of tides the 30 day period shown in the small inserts contained a severe cold front occurred during january 4 2010 january 15 2010 the daily low of the measured air temperature was below 0 c every day during this 12 day period making it the longest time on record for consecutive days with freezing air temperature in the area as shown in fig 6 a the coldest air temperature was 7 78 c during the 12 day period and recorded at 6 00 am on january 11 2010 although 7 78 c is not the coldest air temperature on record for the area the longevity of the coldness makes this time point and several hours around it to be critical in terms of the availability of the useable thermal habitats for manatee the coldest air temperature measured in the region during the entire 125 months of the simulation period was 9 13 c which was recorded at 7 30 am on january 18 2018 fig 6 c in general water temperature in the homosassa river estuary has a delay of response when a cold front moves in other factors such as the temperature boundary conditions at the downstream boundaries sgd temperature heat fluxes at the free surface and transport processes within the water body also affect temperature distributions in the river as such water temperature in the homosassa river is not necessarily synchronous with air temperature based on available temperature data the overall lowest water temperature during the 125 month simulation period in the homosassa river was found to be at 1 00 am on january 12 2010 in this study effects of the sgd reduction on chronic and acute thermal habitats for manatee in the homosassa river estuary were explored at several critical time points ctps when the least amount of thermal refuge may be available for manatee to use besides the coldest air in 2010 6 00 am 1 11 2010 and in 2018 7 30 am 1 18 2018 as well as the coldest water in the river 1 00 am 1 12 2010 two more critical time points were considered for chronic thermal habitats for manatee they are the time points when the lowest chronic thermal habitats and most sensitive extremely low thermal habitats to the sgd reduction occurred during the 125 month simulation period under the bfc for 20 c water volume the former occurred at 3 00 am 12 14 2010 and had a value of 154 186 m3 under the bfc while the latter occurred at 12 00 am 12 14 2010 for 20 c water surface area the former occurred at 12 00 am 12 14 2010 and was 122 057 m2 under the bfc while the latter occurred at 11 30 pm 12 13 2010 clearly the lowest 20 c water volume and the lowest 20 c surface area did not occur at the same time and there was a 3 hour difference between the two global minimum points the most sensitive time points for the two extremely lower thermal habitats were not synchronous either here the extremely low chronic thermal habitats are those with 99 98 exceedance probability because the sensitivity of the chronic thermal habitats to the sgd reduction may also vary with the sgd condition we considered the sensitivity under the baseline sgd condition in other words it is the most sensitive time point when the extremely low chronic thermal habitats were reduced most with the baseline sgd being reduced by a small percentage e g 1 85 table 2 shows the five ctps of chronic thermal habitats for manatee with the chronic thermal habitats for the bfc being also included in the table the starting and ending time points bracketing the ctps were 36 h before and after the ctps in table 2 ctps are ordered according to the time they occurred as can be seen from the table while ctp1 ctp2 and ctp5 for 20 c water volume are the same as those for 20 c surface area ctp3 and ctp4 for 20 c water volume are not the same as those for 20 c surface area from table 2 one can see that at ctp5 when the air temperature reached the lowest at 9 13 c in the region during the 125 month period 20 c water volume and surface area for the baseline flow scenario were both highest among the five ctps at ctp5 chronic thermal habitats were about 55 and 69 more than their lowest values for 20 c volume and surface area respectively the lowest and most sensitive extremely low 20 c water volume and 20 c surface area occurred during a cold front in middle of december 2010 neither during the early 2010 cold front which had the longest consecutive days of freezing air temperature nor during the early 2018 cold front which had the coldest air temperature during the 125 month period for the region although the december 2010 cold front did not have the lowest air temperature or most consecutive subzero days the combination of cold air low sgds entering the estuary and low water temperature and high tides at the downstream boundary caused the global minimum points for 20 c surface area and volume to respectively occur at 12 00 am and 3 00 am on 12 14 2010 the same combination also caused the most sensitive extremely low 20 c surface area and volume for the 125 month simulation period to occur during this cold front because a reduction of sgd not only reduces the amount of warm water entering the estuarine system but also more or less affects other physical processes and parameters e g density distribution mixing baroclinic forces heat exchanges at the free surface velocities elevations etc in the river which eventually affect the temperature distribution in the water body as the interactions among these processes are highly nonlinear the relationship between water temperature and the percentage of the sgd reduction in the estuary can become very complicated a close examination of fig 5 shows that due to the nonlinear interactions an sgd reduction can cause the time series of the 72 hour moving averages of 20 c volume and surface area to have a phase drift fig 7 a and b show relationships of the chronic thermal habitats with the percentage reduction of the sgd at the five ctps ratios of these chronic thermal habitats for manatee to the corresponding values at the five ctps for the bfc shown as percentages are plotted in fig 7 c and d where the slopes of the curves represent the sensitivities of the chronic thermal habitats for manatee to the change of the sgd from fig 7 a and b one can see that the 72 hour averages of 20 c water volume and surface area decrease linearly with the increase of the sgd reduction at all five ctps the small phase drift caused by the sgd reduction do not affect the linearity of the relationships however at different time points the 20 c water volume or surface area responds to the sgd reduction differently at ctp3 when the most sensitive extremely low thermal habitat occurred and ctp4 when the minimum value occurred 72 hour averages of 20 c water volume and surface area respond to the sgd reduction practically in the same sensitive way with slopes of the curves in fig 7 c and d being the steepest although chronic thermal habitats for manatee are most sensitive to a sgd change at ctp3 the difference between ctp3 and ctp4 is very small in terms of the value and sensitivity it is reasonable to conclude that when extremely low chronic thermal habitats for manatee are present in the homosassa estuary they are very sensitive to any sgd reduction with a sensitivity in the same order as those at ctp3 and ctp4 in fig 7 c the slopes for ctp3 and ctp4 can be obtained from linear regression lines and they are 1 32 and 1 31 respectively the coefficients of determination for the linear regression are 0 994 for ctp3 and 0 996 for ctp4 in fig 7 d the slopes for ctp3 and ctp4 are both 1 28 coefficients of determination for the linear regression are both 0 996 in other words every one percent reduction of sgd would cause a 1 31 1 32 percent reduction of 20 c water volume and a 1 28 reduction 20 c surface area as chronic thermal habitats for manatee are most sensitive when they are at their extremely low levels in the homosassa river a reduction of the sgd to the estuary will cause the relative difference between the extremely low habitats and those of other time points even greater for example as mentioned above chronic thermal habitats for manatee at ctp5 were about 55 and 69 larger than those at ctp4 for 20 c water volume and surface area respectively at the bfc if the sgd were reduced by 30 20 c water volume was reduced to 94 603 m3 while 20 c surface area was reduced to 75 978 m2 at ctp4 however with a 30 sgd reduction 20 c water volume and 20 c surface at ctp5 were reduced to 200 776 m3 and 166 045 m2 respectively chronic thermal habitats for manatee at ctp5 were 112 and 119 larger than those at ctp4 for 20 c water volume and 20 c water volume surface area respectively because of the phase drift ctp4s are not necessarily the global minimum points of 20 c water volume and surface area for the 30 sgd reduction scenario and the real minimum chronic thermal habitats for manatee are smaller than 94 603 m3 and 75 978 m2 for volume and surface area respectively as the thermal habitats for manatee in the homosassa river are affected by factors such as circulations sgd sgd temperature water temperature at the mouth tidal flow and heat exchange with the air an effort was made to correlate these factors with chronic thermal habitats for manatee without going into details of heat exchange with the environment and heat transport inside the estuarine system let us simplify the complex problem by only considering heat sources at the boundaries downstream open boundaries sgds from spring vents and the free surface that would expand the extent of 20 c water in the estuary for simplicity let us only use the air temperature to represent the variability of the heat source at the free surface solar radiation is implicitly considered with the air temperature for the same reason let us use η t to represents the variability of tidal velocity and thereby the tidal flux then the variability of the total heat flux entering the system that would augment 20 c thermal habitats can be roughly characterized by a heat flux parameter as follows 5 h f a q t δ t m b q g δ t g c a s δ t a d where h f is the heat flux parameter a b c and d are parameters that need to be determined q t is incoming tidal flux and is approximated as max a s η t 0 q g is the net sgd a s is average surface area and δ t m δ t g and δ t a are respectively the temperatures above a reference value for water at the mouth sgd and air and take the following form 6 δ t m m a x t m t 0 0 δ t g m a x t g t 0 0 δ t a m a x t a t 0 0 where t 0 is a reference temperature and t m t g and t a are respectively the water temperature at the mouth the sgd temperature and the air temperature by relating simulated chronic thermal habitats with h f parameters a b c d and t 0 in the above equations can be determined by the curve fitting as the chronic thermal habitats for manatee have a 72 hour time scale and their extent is generally affected by preceding conditions it is logical to relate chronic thermal habitats for manatee with the 72 hour average of the heat flux parameter with the consideration a time lag using a trial and error approach in the curve fitting it was determined that the time lag is 12 h t 0 is 19 8 c and the coefficients for the parameters in eq 5 are aas 36 water elevation in cm or 1097 3 water elevation in feet b 0 035 sgd in m3 s or 0 001 sgd in ft3 s cas 2 5 and d 0 5 as a result the heat flux parameter for the homosassa river takes the following form 7 h f 36 η t δ t m 0 035 q g δ t g 2 5 δ t a fig 8 shows plots of the chronic thermal habitats versus the 72 hour average of the heat flux parameter with a 12 hour lag the top panel of fig 8 is for the 20 c water volume while the bottom panel is for the 20 c surface area high 20 c water volume values shown in fig 8 a occurred mostly during major storms for example hurricane hermine in late august and early september of 2016 caused 20 c water volume to be higher than 10 million m3 for about 3 days while tropical storm debby in june 2012 also cause 20 c water volume to be higher than 10 million m3 for a couple of days the chronic thermal habitats for manatee in the homosassa river estuary fit a logarithm relationship with the heat flux parameter the best the logarithm curves shown in fig 8 fit the data with a r2 of 0 92 for 20 c volume and 0 93 for 20 c surface area in other words using the logarithm relationship about 92 of the total variance of 20 c volume and about 93 of the total variance of 20 c surface area can be explained by the variance of the heat flux parameter the logarithm equations shown in fig 8 a and b can be re written as 8 v c h l t 2 221 ln h f t 12 0 923 9 a c h l t 1 727 ln h f t 12 0 8102 where v c h l and a c h l are respectively 20 c volume in million m3 and surface area in million m2 of the chronic thermal habitats for manatee at time point t in hours and h f t 12 is the arithmetic means of h f during t 48 t 24 it is worth mentioning that all the parameters in eq 5 were determined during the curve fitting for 20 c volume as shown in fig 8 a these same parameters were used to fit the logarithm line for 20 c surface area without any adjustments one can see from fig 8 b that the logarithm equation fits the 20 c surface area results well with a r2 of 0 93 verifying that the heat flux parameter expressed in eq 5 is a good predictor of the chronic thermal habitats in the homosassa river estuary 5 2 acute thermal habitats for manatee the 15 c thermal habitats are simply the summations of 20 c habitats and those between 15 and 20 c shown in figs 3 and 4 time series of 4 hour moving averages of water volume and surface area for temperature 15 c during the 360 day period between july 23 2009 and july 7 2010 are shown in fig 9 for the bfc the existing flow condition and the 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 flow reduction scenarios in the figure acute thermal habitats for manatee during the same 30 day period shown in fig 5 are also plotted in the small inserts unlike the 72 hour moving averages which have most tidal variations removed the 4 hour moving averages shown in fig 9 still contain substantial tidal signals in the acute thermal habitats for manatee from fig 9 one can see that 15 c water volume and 15 c surface area for various sgd reduction scenarios have averages of about 7 5 million m3 and 5 5 million m2 respectively during april november the former has a variability of less than 2 million m3 while the latter has a variability of less 1 million m2 because no 15 c water volume or 15 c surface area exists in the homosassa river during april november 15 c water volume and 15 c surface area in these months represent total volume and surface area with a depth 1 16 m or deeper in the estuary during december march both 15 c water volume and 15 c surface area vary dramatically from less than 0 2 million m3 to over 9 million m3 for 15 c water volume and from less than 0 2 million m2 to over 6 million m2 for 15 c surface area obviously the routine cold front during the winter and early spring has a big influence on the acute thermal habitats in the homosassa river estuary it should be pointed out that 15 c water volumes and 15 c surface areas shown in fig 9 for the bfc and the 10 flow reduction condition are generally lower than the summations of thermal habitats for temperature 20 c and for temperature between 15 and 20 c shown in figs 3 and 4 the reason is that the calculation of the acute thermal habitats considers the depth layer thickness requirement of 1 16 m for manatee because of this depth layer thickness requirement the 4 hour averages of 15 c surface area as shown in fig 9 even exhibit more variabilities than those in figs 3 and 4 similar to the analysis for the chronic thermal habitats five ctps were examined including those when the air temperature were lowest in 2010 and 2018 when water temperature in the river was coldest when the 4 hour moving average of 15 c thermal habitats were lowest for the bfc and when the lowest 0 02 acute thermal habitats were most sensitive to the sgd reduction again because the sensitivity of the acute thermal habitats for manatee may vary with the sgd condition we considered the ctp when extremely low acute thermal habitats for manatee were reduced most for the bfc at 10 00 am 12 14 2010 the river had the smallest amount of the 4 hour average of 15 c volume for the bfc 159 732 m3 at 7 00 am 12 14 2010 the 4 hour average of 15 c water volume had the most sensitive reaction to the sgd reduction among the lowest 0 02 in the river for the 4 hour average of 15 c surface area under the bfc the minimum 123 877 m2 occurred at 9 30 am 12 14 2010 while the most sensitive extremely low habitat occurred two hours later at 11 30 am on 12 14 2010 table 3 lists the five ctps for the acute thermal habitats in the order of their occurrences during the 125 month simulation period the starting and ending times of the four hour windows are two hours before and after the ctps table 3 also includes the acute thermal habitats for manatee in the homosassa river at the five ctps for the bfc like the chronic thermal habitats for manatee the largest acute thermal habitats among the five ctps occurred at ctp5 when the air temperature in the region reached 9 13 c the lowest during the 125 month period at ctp5 4 hour averages of 15 c water volume and 15 c surface area were 951 766 m3 and 847 061 m2 respectively which were about 5 96 and 6 84 times of their minimum values at ctp4 for 15 c water volume and ctp3 for 15 c surface area consistent with the chronic thermal habitats for manatee the lowest acute thermal habitats for manatee and the most sensitive extremely low acute thermal habitats did not occurred during the early 2010 cold front when its duration was the longest or during the early 2018 cold front when the air temperature dropped to the lowest in the region instead the lowest and most sensitive extremely low 15 c water volume and 15 c surface area occurred during a cold front in december 2010 fig 10 a and b show relationships of the acute thermal habitats with the percentage reduction of the sgd at the five ctps ratios of these acute thermal habitats for manatee to their baseline values are calculated as percentages and presented in fig 10 c and d where the slopes of the curves represent the sensitivities of the acute thermal habitats of manatee to the change of the sgd from fig 10 a and b one can see that the 4 hour averages of 15 c water volume and 15 c surface area roughly decrease linearly with the increase of the sgd reduction at ctp1 ctp2 and ctp5 when the coldest air temperature or the coldest water temperature occurred however at ctp3 or ctp4 the relationships between acute thermal habitats for manatee and the sgd reduction exhibit some severe nonlinearities which are more substantial in the ratio plots shown in figs 10 c and d there could be several factors causing the severe nonlinear relationship between acute thermal habitats for manatee and the sgd reduction at ctp3 and ctp4 in addition to those that drives the hydrodynamics and heat transport processes in the estuary such as tides currents wind salinity distributions heat exchanges with the air etc a reduction of the sgd could have a profound effect on the hydrodynamics and transport processes as it not only causes the reduction of thermal habitats but also changes the temperature and salinity distributions in the estuary further altering the baroclinic force and consequently the thermal transport processes in the estuary most of these factors have daily or sub daily time scales and their interactions are typically quite nonlinear resulting in substantial amount of higher frequency signals in thermal habitats for manatee when these habitats are low when the thermal habitats are filtered with a 72 hour window these higher frequency signals are typically eliminated resulting in nearly perfect linear relationships between chronic thermal habitats for manatee and the sgd reduction percentage fig 7 however when they are filtered with a 4 hour window some of these nonlinear features remain as a result the linearity of the relationship with the sgd reduction for acute thermal habitats for manatee is much lower than that for the chronic thermal habitats for manatee especially when the acute thermal habitats are very low in the estuary another reason for the nonlinearity of the relationship shown in fig 10 c and d for ctp3 and ctp4 is the 1 16 m depth layer thickness requirement for manatee to fully submerged in the water because a reduction of the sgd can affect the water depth in the vicinity of the spring vents where acute thermal habitats mostly exist during the cold days the inclusion or exclusion of grid cells based on this requirement may cause the acute thermal habitats for manatee to have a sudden change in the estuary when the acute thermal habitats for manatee are abundant in the system the impact of the depth layer thickness requirement on these habitats is minor however when they are scarce the impact can be significant the nonlinear interactions of the processes involved in the heat transport in the estuary will also cause thermal habitats in the estuary to respond to the sgd reduction differently at different sgd levels as such the time series of the thermal habitats are generally not synchronous for different sgd reductions this kind of phase drift is evident even for the chronic thermal habitats for manatee when the variables are filtered with a 72 hour window for the acute thermal habitats for manatee the phase drift is more apparent as ctp3 and ctp4 are for the bfc they may not be the time points of the lowest or the most sensitive extremely low acute thermal habitats for manatee when the sgd is reduced in fact when the sgd reduction was 15 or more 12 000 pm 1 2 2018 instead of 10 00 am 12 14 2010 was the global minimum point for the 15 c water volume in the homosassa river when the sgd reduction was 22 5 or more 10 00 am 1 2 2018 instead of 9 30 am 12 14 2010 was the global minimum point for 15 c surface area an effort was made to find a simple heat flux parameter similar to that expressed in eq 5 to predict the acute thermal habitats for manatee in the homosassa river estuary however this effort failed mainly because the acute thermal habitats for manatee contain a large number of high frequency variabilities with a time scale that is diurnal semi diurnal or even hourly while some of these high frequency variabilities directly come from factors determining the temperature distribution in the estuary some are results of the nonlinear interaction of these factors it was found that a heat flux parameter similar to that defined in eq 5 can only explain 30 45 percent of the total variances seen in the acute thermal habitats for manatee 6 conclusions effects of the sgd reduction on thermal habitats for manatee in the homosassa river a spring fed estuary located on the gulf coast of florida were studied using a laterally averaged hydrodynamic model after the model was calibrated and verified against real time data of water level salinity and temperature measured at five fixed stations during a 34 month period between 11 4 2014 and 8 31 2017 it was used to conduct a series of simulations for 125 months from october 2007 to february 2018 a total of 14 flow scenario simulations were made using the model including the bfc existing flow condition and 12 sgd reduction scenarios from 2 5 to 30 reduction with an increment of 2 5 the baseline scenario is an imaginary flow condition which was obtained by adding estimated withdrawals from the springshed to the existing flow condition the existing flow condition includes all the gaged and estimated sgds entering the estuarine system based on the physiology of the manatee chronic and acute thermal habitats for manatee were computed and analyzed for all the sgd reduction scenarios because of the importance of availability of chronic and acute thermal habitats to the survival of manatees it is critical that there are enough thermal habitats in the estuary for manatees to use during critical cold times this study selected five ctps for various thermal habitats at which effects of the sgd reduction on these habitats were studied the five ctps included the time points when the air temperature in the region was the lowest in 2010 and 2018 when the water temperature in the homosassa river was the lowest when the thermal habitats for manatee was the lowest and when the extremely low thermal habitats was the most sensitive to the sgd reduction under the bfc because of the use of a 72 hour window for averaging most of the tidal signals which are primarily semidiurnal for the homosassa river can be filtered out in the chronic thermal habitats for manatee although there are strong nonlinear interactions among factors affecting the thermal habitats in the homosassa river estuary it was found that chronic thermal habitats for manatee in the homosassa river are linearly correlated with the sgd reduction for all five ctps because most these nonlinear interactions have a time scale of daily or sub daily and are eliminated or weakened with the 72 hour averaging the sensitivity of the chronic thermal habitats for manatee to the sgd at different ctps are different generally when the availability of chronic habitats become very scarce the sensitivity is the highest for example at the time points when chronic thermal habitats were lowest during the 125 month simulation period every 1 sgd reduction could cause a 1 31 1 32 reduction of 20 c water volume and a 1 28 reduction 20 c surface area using a simple heat flux parameter defined as h f 36 η t δ t m 0 035 q g δ t g 2 5 δ t a it was found that the chronic thermal habitats for manatee can be estimated with a logarithm relationship the r2 values of the logarithm equations for the 20 c water volume and 20 c surface area are 0 92 and 0 93 respectively for the acute thermal habitats for manatee although some tidal signals have been filtered out there exist significant tidal variations during warm days when most of the estuary has water volume and surface area 15 c during cold days although the tidal signals are smaller they are evident in acute thermal habitats for manatee signals of the nonlinear interactions among factors affecting the thermal habitats in the estuary cannot be totally filtered out with the 4 hour time window in averaging either as a result relationships between the acute thermal habitats and the sgd reduction do not have as good a linearity as that for the chronic thermal habitats for manatee when the amount of acute thermal habitats is extremely low the nonlinearity of the relationships is strong with a significant phase drift which can change the global minimum point dramatically to this end the 1 16 m depth layer thickness requirement also plays a big role in changing the global minimum point because of the importance of the sgd to the thermal habitats for manatee and the overall ecological health of the homosassa river estuary it is critical to have an accurate quantification of the sgds entering the system although there exist ample data collected in the homosassa river system many uncertainties in estimating sgds entering the estuary remain unquantified for example one of those uncertainties could come from the use of the usgs regression equation in estimating the sgd from homosassa springs to the estuary the usgs uses the groundwater level measured in a well that is more than 30 km away from the spring vents in the regression equation since the hydrogeologic property can vary significantly within a 30 km distance potentiometric surface at homosassa springs may not have a linear and time independent relationship with the groundwater level in that well an effort should be made in future studies to resolve this issue so that a better understanding of the hydrological condition of the system and its potential impacts on manatees in the homosassa river estuary can be achieved declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
24575,effects of the reduction of submarine groundwater discharge sgd on thermal habitats for manatee in the homosassa river a spring fed estuary in florida were studied using a laterally averaged hydrodynamic model the estuary receives its hydrologic loading from numerous spring vents mainly located at its headwaters and two upstream tributaries the model was calibrated and verified against real time data collected during november 2014 august 2017 before it was used to simulate hydrodynamics salinity transport and thermal dynamics in the estuary from october 9 2007 to march 12 2018 with various sgd reductions effects of the sgd reduction on chronic 72 hour timescale and acute 4 hour timescale thermal habitats for manatee were analyzed at five critical time points ctps including those of the lowest air temperature in 2010 and 2018 the lowest water temperature the minimum thermal habitats and the most sensitive extremely low habitats it is found that the chronic thermal habitats for manatee decrease linearly with the increase of the sgd reduction at these ctps when chronic thermal habitats are extremely low they are most sensitive to the sgd reduction every 1 reduction of the sgd could cause roughly a 1 31 1 32 reduction of 20 c water volume and a 1 28 reduction of 20 c surface area the chronic thermal habitats for manatee in the homosassa river can be predicted using a simple heat flux parameter h f which explains 92 and 93 of the total variances of 20 c water volume and surface area respectively using a logarithm relationship the linearity of the relationships between the acute thermal habitats for manatee and the sgd reduction is weak in fact when acute thermal habitats in the estuary are extremely low their relationships with the sgd reduction are very nonlinear with the global minimum points varying significantly for various sgd reductions keywords submarine groundwater discharge spring fed estuary laterally averaged hydrodynamic model chronic thermal habitats for manatee acute thermal habitats for manatee 1 introduction the homosassa river is a spring fed estuary located in citrus county on the gulf coast of central florida fig 1 the river is about 13 km long from its headspring to the gulf of mexico and has a width varying from about 60 m in the upstream reach to about 305 m near the mouth yobbi and knochemus 1989 the homosassa river is a shallow waterbody with a mean water depth of approximately 1 2 m and the riverbed less than one meter deep from the mean tide level for most of the area of the estuary the estuarine system includes several tributaries and distributaries among which the southeast folk and the hall river flow to the upstream area of the homosassa river while the salt river and mason creek branch off from the main stem of the homosassa river to meet the gulf of mexico gom the estuary also has some other smaller tributaries including a channel system in the town of homosassa and the hidden river the homosassa river flows through a coastal swamps region where poorly drained and saturated organic soils overlie limestone rocks of the upper florida aquifer ufa as most of the wetland is self percolating and barely contributes any quantifiable surface water runoff the estuary receives an insignificant amount of freshwater runoff from its 145 km2watershed most of the hydrologic loading to the homosassa river comes from the ufa in the form of submarine groundwater discharge sgd out of numerous spring vents located in the headspring area and in several of its tributaries mainly the southeast fork and the halls river locations of the springs that discharge groundwater flows to the homosassa river are shown as solid dots in fig 1 the headwaters of the river are the homosassa springs and several other springs the contributing groundwater field for the spring flow discharge is subject to the shape of potentiometric surface in the region and thus varies with time depending on the precipitation pattern in the region in a similar way that the watershed for surface water runoff is delineated the contributing groundwater field or springshed is delineated based on the potentiometric contours for the spring flows entering the homosassa river the area of the springshed varies around 700 km2 with a slight year to year variation like some other estuaries along the gulf coast of florida the homosassa river estuary is under the action of microtidal forces which are primarily semidiurnal as the estuary is relatively shallow it is generally well or partially mixed the system is ecologically important for many marine species including florida manatees trichechus manatus latirostris and common snook centropomus undecimalis which use the spring fed estuaries as thermal refuges in winters because a large amount of spring water with a relatively constant temperature of about 23 0 c or higher flows to the river these marine species can have a huge economic impact on local communities in florida as they can attract millions of visitors to the sunshine state citrus county is especially famous for manatee related tourism in florida for example the headwater area of the homosassa river homosassa springs is a great destination for many tourists coming to florida to visit where one can view manatees and enjoy numerous other recreational activities snorkeling in the coastal springs and swimming with florida manatees in the homosassa river are an incredible experience which many visitors will forever cherish florida manatee is a subspecies of the west indian manatee which has been included on the us endangered species list since the 1970s to prevent the population decline the west indian manatee is protected by different federal and state laws including the marine mammal protection act of 1972 the endangered species act of 1973 and the florida manatee sanctuary act of 1978 https myfwc com conservation you conserve wildlife manatee as a result the wet indian manatee had a population increase in recent years and was reclassified from endangered to threatened in 2018 the law library 2018 under the authority of the endangered species act of 1973 nevertheless all federal protections for the west indian manatee under the endangered species act remain in place manatee protection has not only provided a great ecological value to the estuary but also benefited local communities in florida a study by solomon et al 2004 strongly supported the argument that manatee protection provides citrus county with a significant net benefit their study estimated that the net benefits of manatee protection in citrus county was approximately 8 2 9 million primarily gained through eco tourism there are only limited previous studies on effect of sgds on thermal habitats in the homosassa river estuary hsw engineering inc 2011 applied the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc originally developed by hamrick 1992 to simulate circulations salinity transport processes and thermal dynamics in the homosassa river they had to expand and deepen the downstream area of the river to form a large funnel to allow estuarine water to be transported upstream hsw engineering inc 2011 clearly this artificial alteration of the topography and bathymetry dramatically changed the shape of the estuary that was simulated and should not be made in any of hydrodynamic modeling studies model results from an estuary that has a dramatically different shape from the real estuary are meaningless as mentioned in chen 2012 most previous coastal and estuarine hydrodynamic modeling studies did not consider effects of sgds johnson et al 1991 blumberg and kim 2000 partly because sgds are much lower than river flows and precipitations for these estuaries and partly because sgds are very difficult to quantify in many cases there are only very limited estuarine and coastal hydrodynamic modeling studies which considered sgds ganju et al 2012 applied the 3d model roms warner et al 2008 to west falmouth harbor massachusetts to verify their tidal and groundwater flux estimates to the estuary based on velocity and salinity measurements estimated and considered sgds in the hydrodynamic simulations for crystal river kings bay using the 3d model unless3d to analyze thermal habitats for manatee in the estuary he found that sgds in crystal river kings is not only negatively proportional to the tides but also positively proportional to the first derivative of tides with respect to time as almost all the hydrologic loading to the homosassa river estuary comes from sgds from numerous spring vents the term flow and the term sgd are exchangeable in this paper in the following sections the laterally averaged model lamfe is briefly introduced followed by a short description of model calibration and verification against measured real time water levels salinities and temperatures at five fixed stations in the estuary during a 34 month period model simulations for a series of the sgd reduction scenarios are presented with simulated thermal habitats during a 125 month period being analyzed effects of the sgd reduction on chronic and acute thermal habitats for manatee were evaluated and discussed conclusions of the modeling study are provided at the end of the paper 2 laterally averaged hydrodynamic model because the homosassa river is a narrow and meandering estuary its circulation pattern and salinity and temperature distributions vary primarily in the vertical and longitudinal directions vertically two dimensional variations are typical for narrow estuaries prandle 1985 jay and smith 1990 chen 2004a for which the most suitable simulation tool is a laterally averaged model this study used the laterally averaged model for estuaries lamfe developed by the author for the simulation of circulations salinity transport processes and thermal dynamics in the homosassa river the lamfe model has been applied to several estuaries over the last two decades including the lower hillsborough river chen et al 2000 the lower alafia river chen 2004b the lower peace and myakka rivers chen 2007a 2008 and the lower manatee braden rivers chen 2007b the model uses the hydrostatic pressure assumption and solves the following laterally averaged governing equations 1 u b x w b z v 2 u t u u x w u z τ w x ρ 0 b g η x g ρ 0 z η ρ x d ζ 1 b x b a h u x 1 b z b a z u z 3 b c t u b c x w b c z z b b h c x z b b v b c z v c t where x is horizontal coordinate in the longitudinal direction of along the river estuary z is the vertical coordinate t is time c is concentration u and w represent velocities in x and z directions respectively v is the velocity for lateral input direct runoff tributary etc b is the width of the estuary a function of x and z ρ

walls ah and av are eddy viscosities in the x and z directions respectively bh and bv are horizontal and vertical eddy diffusivities respectively and ct represents concentration in lateral input the equation for the free surface is obtained by integrating eq 1 over the water depth 4 b η η t x h 0 η u b d z h 0 η v d z r b η where ho is the bottom elevation b η is the width of the river estuary at the free surface and r is the net rain intensity rainfall minus evaporation in cm sec 1 the lamfe model uses a cartesian grid system with a staggered arrangement of model variables pressure concentrations and density are calculated at the cell center u and w velocities are calculated at the centers of the right and top faces of the cell respectively and surface elevation is computed at the center of horizontal grid the horizontal eddy viscosity ah and diffusivity bh are calculated using the sub grid scale model of smagorinsky 1963 in the lamfe model for the estimation of the vertical eddy viscosity av and vertical eddy diffusivity bv the lamfe model provides several options including a simplified second order closure model and a turbulent kinetic energy tke model chen 1994 that is similar to that of sheng and villaret 1989 the solver of the lamfe model uses a semi implicit scheme called the free surface correction fsc method the fsc method is a predictor corrector approach that involves two steps in the first step an intermediate velocity field is solved by treating the pressure gradient term and the convection terms explicitly and treating the vertical eddy viscosity terms and bottom and sidewall frictions implicitly an intermediate free surface is found from eq 4 using the intermediate velocity field the final free surface is obtained by solving an equation of the fsc that is derived from a semi implicit treatment of the hydrostatic pressure term after the final free surface is found the final velocity field is calculated by adjusting the intermediate velocity field using the fsc the method is unconditional stable with respect to gravity waves bottom and wall frictions and the vertical eddy viscosity term in practical applications it generally allows the model to run with a courant number larger than 10 details on the fsc method and its properties can be found in chen 2003 although the z coordinate is used in the model without any transformation the model can fit the bottom variation by using a piecewise linear bottom chen 2001 the resulting grid cells are hybrid and their side views include regular cartesian grid cells and multi face cells that are cut with a piecewise linear bottom details on the use the piecewise linear bottom to fit the bed variation in lamfe are described in chen 2004a 3 model calibrations and verification for the lamfe model application the homosassa river estuary was discretized with 406 grids along the river main stem and its 21 branches to ensure that the main physical characteristics of the system can be properly resolved by the model the horizontal spacing of the grids varies between 29 and 277 m fig 2 shows cross sections that form the 406 lamfe grids along the main stem of the homosassa river and its branches in the vertical direction 15 layers were used to discretize the water column between 6 56 m navd88 and 3 0 m navd88 with the layer thickness ranging between 0 3 m and 1 76 m there were several fixed stations in the homosassa estuary at which real time data of water level salinity and temperature were collected with a 15 minute time interval these fixed stations are marked with yellow or red triangles in fig 1 with yellow triangles being stations maintained by the us geological survey usgs and red triangles by the southwest florida water management district swfwmd as shown in fig 1 the usgs fixed stations included 1 homosassa river at shell island near homosassa 02310712 2 homosassa river at homosassa 02310700 3 halls river near homosassa 02310690 4 halls river at homosassa springs 02310689 5 homosassa springs at homosassa springs 02310678 6 se fork homosassa spring at homosassa springs 02310688 and 7 hidden river near homosassa 02310675 the two swfwmd fixed stations were in the two distributaries namely the salt river and mason creek at the homosassa springs at homosassa springs station the usgs estimates the discharge through the transect using a regression equation that relates the discharge with the tides and the groundwater level in a well that is about 30 km away at the homosassa river at homosassa se fork homosassa spring at homosassa springs and halls river at homosassa springs stations the usgs used acoustic doppler current profilers adcps to measure discharges through these transects discharge data measured at these three stations contain not only sgds but also tidal fluxes passing through the cross sections these tidal fluxes were taken away from the measured discharges to find the net sgds entering the estuarine system chen 2019 2021 the lamfe model used water level salinity and temperature data at the homosassa river at shell island near homosassa salt river and mason creek stations as boundary conditions at the downstream open boundaries at the free surface wind shear stress and heat flux were specified using meteorological data collected near the estuary at the upstream cross sections of the homosassa river se fork and halls river net sgds were used as boundary conditions as salinity and temperature data in sgds from the spring vents were not available salinity and temperature boundary conditions at the upstream cross sections were estimated using a trial and error approach based on measured salinities and temperatures at the homosassa springs at homosassa springs se fork homosassa spring at homosassa springs and halls river at homosassa springs stations details about estimating salinity and temperature boundary conditions for the upstream cross sections are documented in chen 2019 based on the available data that can be used as boundary conditions to drive the model and as target values to calibrate and verify the model a 34 month period between 11 4 2014 and 8 31 2017 was chosen for model calibration and verification with the first 19 months being for model calibration and the remaining 15 months for model verification a variable time step δt between 45 and 60 s was used in model runs with δt 60 s being used about 96 of the 34 month simulation period the lamfe model for the homosassa river was calibrated against measured real time data at the usgs fixed station within the simulation domain se fork homosassa spring homosassa springs at homosassa springs halls river at homosassa spring halls river near homosassa and homosassa river at homosassa stations a few model parameters including the bottom roughness ambient vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity and light attenuation were adjusted to obtain the best match of simulated water levels salinities and temperatures and real time field data comparisons of model results with field measurements at the five measurement stations show that a very good agreement between simulated water levels salinities and temperatures and real time data can be reached for both the calibration and verification periods suggesting that the lamfe model performs very well for the homosassa river estuarine system time series plots of simulated results and field data are presented in chen 2019 2021 and thus omitted here the performance of lamfe model for the homosassa river estuary was quantified using several statistics including the mean error me mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse normalized root mean square error nrmse coefficient of determination r 2 and the skill parameter skill of willmott 1981 table 1 is a summary of these statistics for the lamfe model predictions of water level salinity and temperature the lamfe model calibration and verification processes for the homosassa river estuary were quite successful with very good performance statistics for water level salinity and temperature predictions during the entire 34 month period as can be seen from table 1 mes for the water level salinity and temperature simulations are 0 64 cm 0 00 psu and 0 14 c respectively while maes are 5 54 cm 0 46 psu and 0 66 c respectively rmses of simulated water levels salinities and temperatures are respectively 7 21 cm 0 81 psu and 0 98 c nrmses are all 0 03 for the three variables simulated while r2 values for the water level salinity and temperature predictions are respectively 0 86 0 83 and 0 93 willmott skills are 0 95 or higher for simulated water levels salinities and temperatures by the lamfe model 4 simulated thermal habitats for sgd reduction scenarios to study effects of the sgd reduction on thermal habitats a series of model simulation were conducted including the existing flow condition a baseline flow condition bfc and 12 flow reduction scenarios ranging from 2 5 to 30 reduction with a constant increment of 2 5 the bfc is an imaginary flow condition that would exist if no ground water were withdrawn in the springshed it is estimated that the existing withdrawal causes about 1 85 reduction of sgds entering the homosassa river estuary as such the baseline flow is obtained by multiplying the existing sgds with a factor of 1 1 0 0185 it is desirable to run the homosassa river lamfe model for various flow reduction conditions for as many years as possible if input data used to drive the model are available in this study the critical data needed for conducting simulations for multiple years are the downstream boundary conditions with an effort to fill gaps in measured data based on available water level salinity and temperature data in the gom not far from the mouth of the homosassa river the boundary conditions at the downstream open boundary of the simulation domain became available from october 1 2007 to early 2018 allowing a continuous simulation for 125 months or more than 10 years details on the gap filling in the downstream boundary conditions and other data which drive the lamfe model for the homosassa river can be found in chen 2019 because sgds entering the homosassa river estuary have a relatively stable temperature of about 23 0 c or higher throughout the entire year they are important thermal resources for the estuary and provide warm water refuges for some marine species such as manatees and common snook during winter times when cold fronts move to the region and cause water temperature in the gulf to be much lower than 20 c in the spring fed estuaries along the florida gulf coast manatee and snook are more abundant in the winter than summer suggesting their use of thermal habitats as warm water refuge in these water bodies manatees cannot survive in water colder than 20 c for a prolonged period with a high thermal conductance or poor insulation worthy et al 2000 manatees are not able to increase their metabolic rates in cold water to compensate the increased rate of body heat loss based on available data it was found that disastrous losses to the manatee population could occur if exposure to water below 20 c for longer than 4 7 days rouhani et al 2007 when water temperature is further drops to below 15 c manatees cannot withstand the cold for more than 4 h jei and atm 2007 in the modeling study simulated temperature fields were saved to output files with an interval of 30 min for all 14 flow scenarios these model results were processed to calculate thermal habitats for manatee including water volumes and surface areas for temperature 20 c 15 c and 20 c and 15 c as 15 c and 20 c isotherms are critical for manatee in the cold days in winter while a warm water volume that is big enough is important for manatees to stay and swim a warm surface area that is large enough is important for manatees to breath fig 3 shows time series of water volumes top panel and surface areas bottom panel for temperature 15 c 15 c and 20 c and 20 c under the bfc for comparison time series of 15 c 15 c and 20 c and 20 c thermal habits for the 10 flow reduction scenario are shown in fig 4 time series plots of thermal habitats for other flow reduction scenarios are similar and omitted here for simplicity only about one year 360 days of the simulated thermal habitats between july 13 2009 and july 7 2010 were plotted in figs 3 and 4 from figs 3 and 4 one can see that during late april through early october water volumes and surface areas for temperature 15 c as well as 15 c and 20 c are zero and there is no 20 c thermal habitats in the homosassa river in the six months during which the region is warm the air temperature generally has a daily high of 30 c in these warm months and the water temperature in the coastal area is always higher than 20 c as a result water temperature inside the homosassa river is always 20 c and the 20 c thermal habitats shown with blue lines in figs 3 and 4 represent the total water volume and the total surface area of the estuarine system during the six warm months it can be read from figs 3 and 4 that while the total water volume varies roughly around 7 5 million cubic meters the total surface area varies around 6 5 million square meters as such the average water depth in the homosassa river is about 1 15 m on the other hand december march are the coldest months of the year for the region and 15 c thermal habitats red lines in figs 3 and 4 only exist in these cold months during which 20 c thermal habitats reach the minimum in the homosassa river estuary from fig 3 it can be seen that 20 c water volume was less than 1 million m3 for most of january and february in 2010 while 20 c surface area was less than 1 5 million m2 thermal habitats for temperature 15 c varied dramatically during january and february 2010 from zero to more than 6 million m3 for water volume and from zero to about 6 million m2 for surface area thermal habitats for temperature between 15 and 20 c also varied in a very large range from zero to almost the entire estuary from figs 3 and 4 one sees that water volumes and surface areas for all temperature ranges exhibit tidal variations as expected tidal signals in water volume are much stronger than surface area the former is about 1 5 million m3 and the latter is roughly 0 25 million m2 although the tidal variation for latter is only about one sixth of the former the existence of tidal signals in simulated surface areas for various temperature ranges shows that the lamfe model automatically handles the wetting and drying phenomenon because the river width b is included in the governing equations eqs 1 3 although b is a function of x and z and not a function of time the river width at the free surface b η depends on the surface elevation and is updated every time step resulting in a time dependent surface area of the estuary 5 effects of sgd on thermal habitats for manatee because of their inability to survive in cold environment manatees that are exposure to water below 20 c for longer than 4 7 days could suffer disastrous losses rouhani et al 2007 as a result a time scale shorter than 96 h should be used in analyzing effects of sgd reduction on 20 c water volume and surface area in the homosassa river to be conservative this study followed previous studies by rouhani et al 2007 jei and atm 2007 and herrick et al 2017 and chose a time scale of 72 h in analyzing thermal habitats for temperature 20 c when water temperature drops to below 15 c the condition for manatees becomes very harsh as most young and old manatees cannot survive in water with temperature 15 c for more than four hours naturally manatees try to avoid 15 c habitats and find warmer habitats to survive in these conditions as such the existence and extension of 15 c habitats with a time scale of four hours are critical and need to be protected to minimize manatee mortality because adult manatees are big and need a dimension of 1 16 m 1 16 m 2 29 m rouhani et al 2007 to fully submerged in warm water water volumes and surface areas associated with water depth less than 1 16 m cannot be used by manatee as thermal refuge and were thus excluded in the analysis furthermore 20 c or 15 c layers less than 1 16 m thick were excluded in the calculation either in the following discussion of simulated thermal habitats for manatee this 1 16 m depth layer thickness requirement is always considered and will not be specifically mentioned in the text water volumes and surface area with temperature 20 c and a time scale of 72 h or longer are referred to as chronic thermal habitats for manatee while those with temperature 15 c and a time scale of 4 h or longer are acute thermal habitats for manatee in the analysis of chronic thermal habitats for manatee signals with a time scale less than 72 h were filtered out by taking 72 hour moving averages of simulated water volumes and surface areas for temperature 20 c similarly in the analysis of acute thermal habitats for manatee signals less 4 h were filtered out by taking 4 hour moving averages of the 15 c volumes and surface areas at any time point t in hours the chronic and acute thermal habitats for manatee were simply calculated as the arithmetic means during t 36 t 36 and t 2 t 2 respectively 5 1 chronic thermal habitats for manatee fig 5 shows 72 hour moving averages of water volume top panel and surface area bottom panel for temperature 20 c for the bfc the existing flow condition and the 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 flow reduction scenarios during the same 360 days as these in figs 3 and 4 the two inserts included in the figure provide more details of the 72 hour moving averages of these manatee thermal habitats during a 30 day period from december 26 2009 to january 24 2010 from fig 5 one can see that 72 hour moving averages of water volume and surface area for water temperature 20 c during the warm days of the year varied roughly around 7 0 million m3 and 5 5 million m2 respectively in the homosassa river during the cold days chronic thermal habitats were reduced significantly to about one order of magnitude smaller than those in the warm days as expected 72 hour moving averages are much smoother than time series of the 20 c water volume and surface area shown in figs 3 and 4 most tidal variations shown in figs 3 and 4 are filtered out by the simple low pass filter with the 72 hour window which is much longer than the periods of diurnal and semi diurnal variations of tides the 30 day period shown in the small inserts contained a severe cold front occurred during january 4 2010 january 15 2010 the daily low of the measured air temperature was below 0 c every day during this 12 day period making it the longest time on record for consecutive days with freezing air temperature in the area as shown in fig 6 a the coldest air temperature was 7 78 c during the 12 day period and recorded at 6 00 am on january 11 2010 although 7 78 c is not the coldest air temperature on record for the area the longevity of the coldness makes this time point and several hours around it to be critical in terms of the availability of the useable thermal habitats for manatee the coldest air temperature measured in the region during the entire 125 months of the simulation period was 9 13 c which was recorded at 7 30 am on january 18 2018 fig 6 c in general water temperature in the homosassa river estuary has a delay of response when a cold front moves in other factors such as the temperature boundary conditions at the downstream boundaries sgd temperature heat fluxes at the free surface and transport processes within the water body also affect temperature distributions in the river as such water temperature in the homosassa river is not necessarily synchronous with air temperature based on available temperature data the overall lowest water temperature during the 125 month simulation period in the homosassa river was found to be at 1 00 am on january 12 2010 in this study effects of the sgd reduction on chronic and acute thermal habitats for manatee in the homosassa river estuary were explored at several critical time points ctps when the least amount of thermal refuge may be available for manatee to use besides the coldest air in 2010 6 00 am 1 11 2010 and in 2018 7 30 am 1 18 2018 as well as the coldest water in the river 1 00 am 1 12 2010 two more critical time points were considered for chronic thermal habitats for manatee they are the time points when the lowest chronic thermal habitats and most sensitive extremely low thermal habitats to the sgd reduction occurred during the 125 month simulation period under the bfc for 20 c water volume the former occurred at 3 00 am 12 14 2010 and had a value of 154 186 m3 under the bfc while the latter occurred at 12 00 am 12 14 2010 for 20 c water surface area the former occurred at 12 00 am 12 14 2010 and was 122 057 m2 under the bfc while the latter occurred at 11 30 pm 12 13 2010 clearly the lowest 20 c water volume and the lowest 20 c surface area did not occur at the same time and there was a 3 hour difference between the two global minimum points the most sensitive time points for the two extremely lower thermal habitats were not synchronous either here the extremely low chronic thermal habitats are those with 99 98 exceedance probability because the sensitivity of the chronic thermal habitats to the sgd reduction may also vary with the sgd condition we considered the sensitivity under the baseline sgd condition in other words it is the most sensitive time point when the extremely low chronic thermal habitats were reduced most with the baseline sgd being reduced by a small percentage e g 1 85 table 2 shows the five ctps of chronic thermal habitats for manatee with the chronic thermal habitats for the bfc being also included in the table the starting and ending time points bracketing the ctps were 36 h before and after the ctps in table 2 ctps are ordered according to the time they occurred as can be seen from the table while ctp1 ctp2 and ctp5 for 20 c water volume are the same as those for 20 c surface area ctp3 and ctp4 for 20 c water volume are not the same as those for 20 c surface area from table 2 one can see that at ctp5 when the air temperature reached the lowest at 9 13 c in the region during the 125 month period 20 c water volume and surface area for the baseline flow scenario were both highest among the five ctps at ctp5 chronic thermal habitats were about 55 and 69 more than their lowest values for 20 c volume and surface area respectively the lowest and most sensitive extremely low 20 c water volume and 20 c surface area occurred during a cold front in middle of december 2010 neither during the early 2010 cold front which had the longest consecutive days of freezing air temperature nor during the early 2018 cold front which had the coldest air temperature during the 125 month period for the region although the december 2010 cold front did not have the lowest air temperature or most consecutive subzero days the combination of cold air low sgds entering the estuary and low water temperature and high tides at the downstream boundary caused the global minimum points for 20 c surface area and volume to respectively occur at 12 00 am and 3 00 am on 12 14 2010 the same combination also caused the most sensitive extremely low 20 c surface area and volume for the 125 month simulation period to occur during this cold front because a reduction of sgd not only reduces the amount of warm water entering the estuarine system but also more or less affects other physical processes and parameters e g density distribution mixing baroclinic forces heat exchanges at the free surface velocities elevations etc in the river which eventually affect the temperature distribution in the water body as the interactions among these processes are highly nonlinear the relationship between water temperature and the percentage of the sgd reduction in the estuary can become very complicated a close examination of fig 5 shows that due to the nonlinear interactions an sgd reduction can cause the time series of the 72 hour moving averages of 20 c volume and surface area to have a phase drift fig 7 a and b show relationships of the chronic thermal habitats with the percentage reduction of the sgd at the five ctps ratios of these chronic thermal habitats for manatee to the corresponding values at the five ctps for the bfc shown as percentages are plotted in fig 7 c and d where the slopes of the curves represent the sensitivities of the chronic thermal habitats for manatee to the change of the sgd from fig 7 a and b one can see that the 72 hour averages of 20 c water volume and surface area decrease linearly with the increase of the sgd reduction at all five ctps the small phase drift caused by the sgd reduction do not affect the linearity of the relationships however at different time points the 20 c water volume or surface area responds to the sgd reduction differently at ctp3 when the most sensitive extremely low thermal habitat occurred and ctp4 when the minimum value occurred 72 hour averages of 20 c water volume and surface area respond to the sgd reduction practically in the same sensitive way with slopes of the curves in fig 7 c and d being the steepest although chronic thermal habitats for manatee are most sensitive to a sgd change at ctp3 the difference between ctp3 and ctp4 is very small in terms of the value and sensitivity it is reasonable to conclude that when extremely low chronic thermal habitats for manatee are present in the homosassa estuary they are very sensitive to any sgd reduction with a sensitivity in the same order as those at ctp3 and ctp4 in fig 7 c the slopes for ctp3 and ctp4 can be obtained from linear regression lines and they are 1 32 and 1 31 respectively the coefficients of determination for the linear regression are 0 994 for ctp3 and 0 996 for ctp4 in fig 7 d the slopes for ctp3 and ctp4 are both 1 28 coefficients of determination for the linear regression are both 0 996 in other words every one percent reduction of sgd would cause a 1 31 1 32 percent reduction of 20 c water volume and a 1 28 reduction 20 c surface area as chronic thermal habitats for manatee are most sensitive when they are at their extremely low levels in the homosassa river a reduction of the sgd to the estuary will cause the relative difference between the extremely low habitats and those of other time points even greater for example as mentioned above chronic thermal habitats for manatee at ctp5 were about 55 and 69 larger than those at ctp4 for 20 c water volume and surface area respectively at the bfc if the sgd were reduced by 30 20 c water volume was reduced to 94 603 m3 while 20 c surface area was reduced to 75 978 m2 at ctp4 however with a 30 sgd reduction 20 c water volume and 20 c surface at ctp5 were reduced to 200 776 m3 and 166 045 m2 respectively chronic thermal habitats for manatee at ctp5 were 112 and 119 larger than those at ctp4 for 20 c water volume and 20 c water volume surface area respectively because of the phase drift ctp4s are not necessarily the global minimum points of 20 c water volume and surface area for the 30 sgd reduction scenario and the real minimum chronic thermal habitats for manatee are smaller than 94 603 m3 and 75 978 m2 for volume and surface area respectively as the thermal habitats for manatee in the homosassa river are affected by factors such as circulations sgd sgd temperature water temperature at the mouth tidal flow and heat exchange with the air an effort was made to correlate these factors with chronic thermal habitats for manatee without going into details of heat exchange with the environment and heat transport inside the estuarine system let us simplify the complex problem by only considering heat sources at the boundaries downstream open boundaries sgds from spring vents and the free surface that would expand the extent of 20 c water in the estuary for simplicity let us only use the air temperature to represent the variability of the heat source at the free surface solar radiation is implicitly considered with the air temperature for the same reason let us use η t to represents the variability of tidal velocity and thereby the tidal flux then the variability of the total heat flux entering the system that would augment 20 c thermal habitats can be roughly characterized by a heat flux parameter as follows 5 h f a q t δ t m b q g δ t g c a s δ t a d where h f is the heat flux parameter a b c and d are parameters that need to be determined q t is incoming tidal flux and is approximated as max a s η t 0 q g is the net sgd a s is average surface area and δ t m δ t g and δ t a are respectively the temperatures above a reference value for water at the mouth sgd and air and take the following form 6 δ t m m a x t m t 0 0 δ t g m a x t g t 0 0 δ t a m a x t a t 0 0 where t 0 is a reference temperature and t m t g and t a are respectively the water temperature at the mouth the sgd temperature and the air temperature by relating simulated chronic thermal habitats with h f parameters a b c d and t 0 in the above equations can be determined by the curve fitting as the chronic thermal habitats for manatee have a 72 hour time scale and their extent is generally affected by preceding conditions it is logical to relate chronic thermal habitats for manatee with the 72 hour average of the heat flux parameter with the consideration a time lag using a trial and error approach in the curve fitting it was determined that the time lag is 12 h t 0 is 19 8 c and the coefficients for the parameters in eq 5 are aas 36 water elevation in cm or 1097 3 water elevation in feet b 0 035 sgd in m3 s or 0 001 sgd in ft3 s cas 2 5 and d 0 5 as a result the heat flux parameter for the homosassa river takes the following form 7 h f 36 η t δ t m 0 035 q g δ t g 2 5 δ t a fig 8 shows plots of the chronic thermal habitats versus the 72 hour average of the heat flux parameter with a 12 hour lag the top panel of fig 8 is for the 20 c water volume while the bottom panel is for the 20 c surface area high 20 c water volume values shown in fig 8 a occurred mostly during major storms for example hurricane hermine in late august and early september of 2016 caused 20 c water volume to be higher than 10 million m3 for about 3 days while tropical storm debby in june 2012 also cause 20 c water volume to be higher than 10 million m3 for a couple of days the chronic thermal habitats for manatee in the homosassa river estuary fit a logarithm relationship with the heat flux parameter the best the logarithm curves shown in fig 8 fit the data with a r2 of 0 92 for 20 c volume and 0 93 for 20 c surface area in other words using the logarithm relationship about 92 of the total variance of 20 c volume and about 93 of the total variance of 20 c surface area can be explained by the variance of the heat flux parameter the logarithm equations shown in fig 8 a and b can be re written as 8 v c h l t 2 221 ln h f t 12 0 923 9 a c h l t 1 727 ln h f t 12 0 8102 where v c h l and a c h l are respectively 20 c volume in million m3 and surface area in million m2 of the chronic thermal habitats for manatee at time point t in hours and h f t 12 is the arithmetic means of h f during t 48 t 24 it is worth mentioning that all the parameters in eq 5 were determined during the curve fitting for 20 c volume as shown in fig 8 a these same parameters were used to fit the logarithm line for 20 c surface area without any adjustments one can see from fig 8 b that the logarithm equation fits the 20 c surface area results well with a r2 of 0 93 verifying that the heat flux parameter expressed in eq 5 is a good predictor of the chronic thermal habitats in the homosassa river estuary 5 2 acute thermal habitats for manatee the 15 c thermal habitats are simply the summations of 20 c habitats and those between 15 and 20 c shown in figs 3 and 4 time series of 4 hour moving averages of water volume and surface area for temperature 15 c during the 360 day period between july 23 2009 and july 7 2010 are shown in fig 9 for the bfc the existing flow condition and the 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 flow reduction scenarios in the figure acute thermal habitats for manatee during the same 30 day period shown in fig 5 are also plotted in the small inserts unlike the 72 hour moving averages which have most tidal variations removed the 4 hour moving averages shown in fig 9 still contain substantial tidal signals in the acute thermal habitats for manatee from fig 9 one can see that 15 c water volume and 15 c surface area for various sgd reduction scenarios have averages of about 7 5 million m3 and 5 5 million m2 respectively during april november the former has a variability of less than 2 million m3 while the latter has a variability of less 1 million m2 because no 15 c water volume or 15 c surface area exists in the homosassa river during april november 15 c water volume and 15 c surface area in these months represent total volume and surface area with a depth 1 16 m or deeper in the estuary during december march both 15 c water volume and 15 c surface area vary dramatically from less than 0 2 million m3 to over 9 million m3 for 15 c water volume and from less than 0 2 million m2 to over 6 million m2 for 15 c surface area obviously the routine cold front during the winter and early spring has a big influence on the acute thermal habitats in the homosassa river estuary it should be pointed out that 15 c water volumes and 15 c surface areas shown in fig 9 for the bfc and the 10 flow reduction condition are generally lower than the summations of thermal habitats for temperature 20 c and for temperature between 15 and 20 c shown in figs 3 and 4 the reason is that the calculation of the acute thermal habitats considers the depth layer thickness requirement of 1 16 m for manatee because of this depth layer thickness requirement the 4 hour averages of 15 c surface area as shown in fig 9 even exhibit more variabilities than those in figs 3 and 4 similar to the analysis for the chronic thermal habitats five ctps were examined including those when the air temperature were lowest in 2010 and 2018 when water temperature in the river was coldest when the 4 hour moving average of 15 c thermal habitats were lowest for the bfc and when the lowest 0 02 acute thermal habitats were most sensitive to the sgd reduction again because the sensitivity of the acute thermal habitats for manatee may vary with the sgd condition we considered the ctp when extremely low acute thermal habitats for manatee were reduced most for the bfc at 10 00 am 12 14 2010 the river had the smallest amount of the 4 hour average of 15 c volume for the bfc 159 732 m3 at 7 00 am 12 14 2010 the 4 hour average of 15 c water volume had the most sensitive reaction to the sgd reduction among the lowest 0 02 in the river for the 4 hour average of 15 c surface area under the bfc the minimum 123 877 m2 occurred at 9 30 am 12 14 2010 while the most sensitive extremely low habitat occurred two hours later at 11 30 am on 12 14 2010 table 3 lists the five ctps for the acute thermal habitats in the order of their occurrences during the 125 month simulation period the starting and ending times of the four hour windows are two hours before and after the ctps table 3 also includes the acute thermal habitats for manatee in the homosassa river at the five ctps for the bfc like the chronic thermal habitats for manatee the largest acute thermal habitats among the five ctps occurred at ctp5 when the air temperature in the region reached 9 13 c the lowest during the 125 month period at ctp5 4 hour averages of 15 c water volume and 15 c surface area were 951 766 m3 and 847 061 m2 respectively which were about 5 96 and 6 84 times of their minimum values at ctp4 for 15 c water volume and ctp3 for 15 c surface area consistent with the chronic thermal habitats for manatee the lowest acute thermal habitats for manatee and the most sensitive extremely low acute thermal habitats did not occurred during the early 2010 cold front when its duration was the longest or during the early 2018 cold front when the air temperature dropped to the lowest in the region instead the lowest and most sensitive extremely low 15 c water volume and 15 c surface area occurred during a cold front in december 2010 fig 10 a and b show relationships of the acute thermal habitats with the percentage reduction of the sgd at the five ctps ratios of these acute thermal habitats for manatee to their baseline values are calculated as percentages and presented in fig 10 c and d where the slopes of the curves represent the sensitivities of the acute thermal habitats of manatee to the change of the sgd from fig 10 a and b one can see that the 4 hour averages of 15 c water volume and 15 c surface area roughly decrease linearly with the increase of the sgd reduction at ctp1 ctp2 and ctp5 when the coldest air temperature or the coldest water temperature occurred however at ctp3 or ctp4 the relationships between acute thermal habitats for manatee and the sgd reduction exhibit some severe nonlinearities which are more substantial in the ratio plots shown in figs 10 c and d there could be several factors causing the severe nonlinear relationship between acute thermal habitats for manatee and the sgd reduction at ctp3 and ctp4 in addition to those that drives the hydrodynamics and heat transport processes in the estuary such as tides currents wind salinity distributions heat exchanges with the air etc a reduction of the sgd could have a profound effect on the hydrodynamics and transport processes as it not only causes the reduction of thermal habitats but also changes the temperature and salinity distributions in the estuary further altering the baroclinic force and consequently the thermal transport processes in the estuary most of these factors have daily or sub daily time scales and their interactions are typically quite nonlinear resulting in substantial amount of higher frequency signals in thermal habitats for manatee when these habitats are low when the thermal habitats are filtered with a 72 hour window these higher frequency signals are typically eliminated resulting in nearly perfect linear relationships between chronic thermal habitats for manatee and the sgd reduction percentage fig 7 however when they are filtered with a 4 hour window some of these nonlinear features remain as a result the linearity of the relationship with the sgd reduction for acute thermal habitats for manatee is much lower than that for the chronic thermal habitats for manatee especially when the acute thermal habitats are very low in the estuary another reason for the nonlinearity of the relationship shown in fig 10 c and d for ctp3 and ctp4 is the 1 16 m depth layer thickness requirement for manatee to fully submerged in the water because a reduction of the sgd can affect the water depth in the vicinity of the spring vents where acute thermal habitats mostly exist during the cold days the inclusion or exclusion of grid cells based on this requirement may cause the acute thermal habitats for manatee to have a sudden change in the estuary when the acute thermal habitats for manatee are abundant in the system the impact of the depth layer thickness requirement on these habitats is minor however when they are scarce the impact can be significant the nonlinear interactions of the processes involved in the heat transport in the estuary will also cause thermal habitats in the estuary to respond to the sgd reduction differently at different sgd levels as such the time series of the thermal habitats are generally not synchronous for different sgd reductions this kind of phase drift is evident even for the chronic thermal habitats for manatee when the variables are filtered with a 72 hour window for the acute thermal habitats for manatee the phase drift is more apparent as ctp3 and ctp4 are for the bfc they may not be the time points of the lowest or the most sensitive extremely low acute thermal habitats for manatee when the sgd is reduced in fact when the sgd reduction was 15 or more 12 000 pm 1 2 2018 instead of 10 00 am 12 14 2010 was the global minimum point for the 15 c water volume in the homosassa river when the sgd reduction was 22 5 or more 10 00 am 1 2 2018 instead of 9 30 am 12 14 2010 was the global minimum point for 15 c surface area an effort was made to find a simple heat flux parameter similar to that expressed in eq 5 to predict the acute thermal habitats for manatee in the homosassa river estuary however this effort failed mainly because the acute thermal habitats for manatee contain a large number of high frequency variabilities with a time scale that is diurnal semi diurnal or even hourly while some of these high frequency variabilities directly come from factors determining the temperature distribution in the estuary some are results of the nonlinear interaction of these factors it was found that a heat flux parameter similar to that defined in eq 5 can only explain 30 45 percent of the total variances seen in the acute thermal habitats for manatee 6 conclusions effects of the sgd reduction on thermal habitats for manatee in the homosassa river a spring fed estuary located on the gulf coast of florida were studied using a laterally averaged hydrodynamic model after the model was calibrated and verified against real time data of water level salinity and temperature measured at five fixed stations during a 34 month period between 11 4 2014 and 8 31 2017 it was used to conduct a series of simulations for 125 months from october 2007 to february 2018 a total of 14 flow scenario simulations were made using the model including the bfc existing flow condition and 12 sgd reduction scenarios from 2 5 to 30 reduction with an increment of 2 5 the baseline scenario is an imaginary flow condition which was obtained by adding estimated withdrawals from the springshed to the existing flow condition the existing flow condition includes all the gaged and estimated sgds entering the estuarine system based on the physiology of the manatee chronic and acute thermal habitats for manatee were computed and analyzed for all the sgd reduction scenarios because of the importance of availability of chronic and acute thermal habitats to the survival of manatees it is critical that there are enough thermal habitats in the estuary for manatees to use during critical cold times this study selected five ctps for various thermal habitats at which effects of the sgd reduction on these habitats were studied the five ctps included the time points when the air temperature in the region was the lowest in 2010 and 2018 when the water temperature in the homosassa river was the lowest when the thermal habitats for manatee was the lowest and when the extremely low thermal habitats was the most sensitive to the sgd reduction under the bfc because of the use of a 72 hour window for averaging most of the tidal signals which are primarily semidiurnal for the homosassa river can be filtered out in the chronic thermal habitats for manatee although there are strong nonlinear interactions among factors affecting the thermal habitats in the homosassa river estuary it was found that chronic thermal habitats for manatee in the homosassa river are linearly correlated with the sgd reduction for all five ctps because most these nonlinear interactions have a time scale of daily or sub daily and are eliminated or weakened with the 72 hour averaging the sensitivity of the chronic thermal habitats for manatee to the sgd at different ctps are different generally when the availability of chronic habitats become very scarce the sensitivity is the highest for example at the time points when chronic thermal habitats were lowest during the 125 month simulation period every 1 sgd reduction could cause a 1 31 1 32 reduction of 20 c water volume and a 1 28 reduction 20 c surface area using a simple heat flux parameter defined as h f 36 η t δ t m 0 035 q g δ t g 2 5 δ t a it was found that the chronic thermal habitats for manatee can be estimated with a logarithm relationship the r2 values of the logarithm equations for the 20 c water volume and 20 c surface area are 0 92 and 0 93 respectively for the acute thermal habitats for manatee although some tidal signals have been filtered out there exist significant tidal variations during warm days when most of the estuary has water volume and surface area 15 c during cold days although the tidal signals are smaller they are evident in acute thermal habitats for manatee signals of the nonlinear interactions among factors affecting the thermal habitats in the estuary cannot be totally filtered out with the 4 hour time window in averaging either as a result relationships between the acute thermal habitats and the sgd reduction do not have as good a linearity as that for the chronic thermal habitats for manatee when the amount of acute thermal habitats is extremely low the nonlinearity of the relationships is strong with a significant phase drift which can change the global minimum point dramatically to this end the 1 16 m depth layer thickness requirement also plays a big role in changing the global minimum point because of the importance of the sgd to the thermal habitats for manatee and the overall ecological health of the homosassa river estuary it is critical to have an accurate quantification of the sgds entering the system although there exist ample data collected in the homosassa river system many uncertainties in estimating sgds entering the estuary remain unquantified for example one of those uncertainties could come from the use of the usgs regression equation in estimating the sgd from homosassa springs to the estuary the usgs uses the groundwater level measured in a well that is more than 30 km away from the spring vents in the regression equation since the hydrogeologic property can vary significantly within a 30 km distance potentiometric surface at homosassa springs may not have a linear and time independent relationship with the groundwater level in that well an effort should be made in future studies to resolve this issue so that a better understanding of the hydrological condition of the system and its potential impacts on manatees in the homosassa river estuary can be achieved declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

24576,preventing declines of native and historically abundant tree species is an important aspect of sustainable forest management but predicting future forest composition is challenging when succession does not tend to follow a well defined path we evaluated the implications of site level interactions between timber harvesting and forest succession on the regional landscape dynamics of the complex and species rich northern acadian forest region our expectation was that forest composition would trend away from long lived and shade tolerant species because rates of landscape disturbance from timber harvesting are high relative to historic rates of natural disturbance we used a novel modeling approach that combined landsat derived time series of forest disturbance to inform realistic simulations of timber harvesting across many individual commercial forest landowners using landis ii and evaluated changes in tree species distributions and abundance with and without harvesting detailed descriptions of initial forest conditions were derived from maps of relative tree species abundance developed using landsat satellite imagery regional inventory data and an innovative machine learning algorithm if recent harvest rates persist simulations suggest timber harvesting will generally be sustainable in our study area however projected rates of site level species turnover were high predominantly favoring species that were less abundant under the region s natural disturbance regime as a result broad scale patterns of projected species co occurrence shifted destabilizing important regional forest types our results highlight both the region s capacity for forest growth and the importance of accurately capturing the local effects of land management when projecting forested regions dominated by commercial ownership keywords aboveground biomass forest composition forest landscape model landis ii northeast usa timber harvest 1 introduction managing for tree species that are native and historically dominant to a region is an important aspect of sustainable forest management amos binks et al 2010 in contrast there is growing evidence that extensive or selective harvesting has contributed to an unmixing or homogenization of many of the mixed conifer deciduous forests of the northern u s and southern canada amatangelo et al 2011 boucher et al 2009 hanberry et al 2013 in these situations long lived shade tolerant conifers associated with late succession are usually the losers while less shade tolerant typically broad leaved trees associated with early succession are often the winners in the mixed laurentian forests of the great lakes st lawrence region for example many areas historically dominated by site limited conifers like eastern hemlock tsuga canadensis have shifted towards dominance by adaptable hardwoods such as red maple acer rubrum following high intensity harvesting amatangelo et al 2011 boucher et al 2009 these regional shifts in species composition coupled with a reduction in forest diversity threaten forest resilience particularly in landscapes facing a complex assembly of threats e g climate change insect outbreaks invasive species messier et al 2019 predicting how harvesting will influence succession thereby making it possible to avoid unwanted species shifts can be a significant challenge for forest managers however particularly when they are reliant on natural regeneration and the conditions that ensure self replacement of desired species are limited gould et al 2005 taylor et al 2009 within the acadian forest region afr of northeastern u s longitudinal studies suggest that maintaining some native conifers in northern mixedwood forests will be challenging even with targeted or intensive management bataineh et al 2013 olson and wagner 2010 although the afr shares many tree species in common with the great lakes st lawrence region an important distinguishing feature of the afr is the presence of red spruce picea rubens sarg pre settlement forests in maine for example were dominated by red spruce and other long lived conifers e g eastern hemlock which often also occurred in mixedwood associations with shade tolerant hardwoods such as sugar maple acer saccharum american beech fagus grandifolia and yellow birch betula alleghaniensis mosseler et al 2003 historically stand dynamics were driven by windfall and the creation of small canopy gaps gap creating wind events occurred with a return interval of approximately 100 years large or catastrophic disturbances were rare

papyrifera although occasionally in high abundance occurred predominantly in the understory mosseler et al 2003 in recent decades however those types of species have become increasingly abundant as rates of landscape disturbance now driven primarily by timber harvesting have increased statistical and empirically derived models are a commonly used tool in forest planning but planning for novel environmental and forest conditions will require more dynamic tools capable of large scale application although generally developed for research purposes forest landscape models flms are increasingly being used for decision support because they can simulate forest response to changing conditions gustafson et al 2011 flms that are phenomenological and stochastic are particularly well suited to application to forest systems in which succession at a given site does not tend to follow a well defined path but rather has many potential endpoints previous studies of regional forest dynamics using an flm have included the afr duveneck et al 2017 duveneck and thompson 2019 wang et al 2017 but in each the effects of timber harvesting were either ignored in lieu of focusing on climate change or generalized based on broad scale information about harvest rates harris et al 2016 timber harvesting is however the dominant forest disturbance factor in northeastern forests brown et al 2018 and in the u s the spatial resolution of the projections was also coarse 250 m or 270 m forest projections that discount the spatially varied and temporally dynamic effects of timber harvesting in northeastern forests particularly those areas dominated by commercial forestlands potentially obscure important details about local feedbacks as well as cross scale interactions affecting regional processes the goal of our study was to better understand the regional implications of local interactions between timber harvesting and forest succession for the afr our primary research objectives were to use a novel implementation of the landis ii flm to expressly emulate recently observed harvest rates and patterns across individual landowners in maine and to project cumulative changes in future tree species distributions and abundance stemming from land use and forest dynamics regionally maine has the highest harvest rates in the afr brown et al 2018 canham et al 2013 duveneck and thompson 2019 in northern maine land is almost entirely owned by commercial forest companies and forest management is almost entirely dependent on partial harvesting and natural regeneration bataineh et al 2013 brissette 1996 canham et al 2013 locally the median annual harvested area in that region is approximately 2 with substantial spatiotemporal variation between landowners which has resulted in distinct landscape scale patterns associated with forest composition and age legaard et al 2015 our expectation was that under the current forest management regime total live aboveground biomass would remain relatively steady but species relative abundances would change with a decline in long lived shade tolerant species such as red spruce olson and wagner 2010 2 methods 2 1 study area we evaluated land use and forest dynamics across a study area that encompassed approximately 30 760 km2 of the afr in maine 67 76 70 61 e 45 16 47 44 n fig 1 virtually all forestland in this area is considered commercially productive and approximately 90 is private primarily owned by large 40 km2 landowners with highly contrasting management objectives including industrial forest products

throughout this region mcwilliams et al 2005 climate in this region is characterized by warm humid summers and cold snowy winters erosion and glaciation have shaped the topography which is mostly flat or rolling with elevations ranging from sea level to over 1 500 m seymour 1995 maine is covered by an extensive network of rivers streams lakes swamps and wetlands forest type distributions are

regeneration is often highly abundant in this region with high species richness high stem densities and limited effects of herbivory bose et al 2016 2 2 forest landscape model we modeled forest change using landis ii version 6 0 landis ii and its predecessor landis have both been described extensively in the literature mladenoff et al 1996 mladenoff and he 1999 mladenoff 2004 scheller and mladenoff 2004 scheller et al 2007 landis ii is a raster based forest landscape model a landscape is represented by a grid of cells aggregated by user defined ecoregions the successional processes of tree establishment growth and mortality are simulated for each cell at the level of tree cohorts characterized by species and age multiple cohorts can be present in a cell and inter cohort competition is driven by life history attributes e g shade tolerance longevity regeneration strategy cells are spatially linked by the processes of seed dispersal and disturbance the landis ii software system is composed of a core program and user selected extensions that have been developed to simulate a variety of disturbances we used the biomass succession extension version 3 1 1 scheller and mladenoff 2004 to simulate succession the biomass harvest extension version 2 1 gustafson et al 2000 to simulate timber harvesting and the base wind scheller and mladenoff 2004 to simulate wind events extensions can be run with different temporal intervals we used a 5 year time step for all based on past experience and a global sensitivity analysis of landis ii simons legaard et al 2015 a novel formulation of parameterizing and initialization was used to ensure robust model behavior as described below 2 3 model initialization landis ii requires as part of its initialization two input maps ecoregions and initial forest conditions and accompanying text files for both ecoregions and initial conditions we used observations and measurements collected at us forest service usfs forest inventory and analysis fia field plots within our study area 2006 2010 n 1 521 as reference data we derived our ecoregions from a combination of climate zones delineated by briggs and lemin 1992 and dem derived slope to capture the effects of relative landscape position on individual species establishment see section 2 4 1 the majority of fia plots in our study area are categorized as mesic occurring either in flat lowlands condition table physiographic class code or physclcd 21 or hilly upland areas physclcd 22 percent slope is recorded for each subplot subplot table and to identify a threshold slope to use for classifying all forest within our study area as lowland or upland we calculated the value at which histograms of slope grouped by the two physclcd categories intersected i e 5 slope we combined our upland lowland delineation with the 3 major climate zones associated with our study area for a total of 6 ecoregions initial forest conditions are provided by the user in the form of a thematic map and associated text file which landis ii uses to populate each cell with information about species presence and forest age for each cell we determined which species were present in high relative abundance using maps of percent biomass live aboveground percent biomass ca 2010 was modeled and mapped for each of the 13 most abundant species in our study area supplementary table 1 following the methods of legaard et al 2020 predictive models were constructed for each species using support vector machines svms with model specification determined by a multi objective genetic algorithm ga designed to simultaneously minimize total prediction error and systematic error estimates of percent biomass from fia plots were used as reference and potential predictor variables included spectral variables from landsat thematic mapper tm images acquired throughout the growing season i e late april through mid october terrain variables generated from the national elevation dataset and national hydrography dataset and climatological variables obtained from the usfs rocky mountain research station rehfeldt 2006 using the cross validation procedure described by legaard et al 2020 rmse root mean squared error and systematic rmse for the final models ranged from 4 17 and 0 5 3 respectively across species from the 13 percent biomass maps we 1 identified the 3 most abundant species for each cell 2 rescaled percent abundances for those 3 species to sum to 100 and 3 assigned cohorts to species based on relative abundance i e 1 33 1 cohort 33 66 2 cohorts and 66 100 3 cohorts if for example after rescaling the relative abundances of the top 3 species in a given cell were 60 30 and 10 they were assigned 2 1 and 1 cohort s respectively this strategy ensured that cohort assignment to a cell represented relative species abundance based on empirical data maintained dominant patterns of species co occurrence and resulted in a total number of cohorts that was computationally tractable for simulations we assigned age s to each species cohort based on disturbance history and fia plot data forest disturbance and basal area removal were mapped for our study area from 1973 to 2010 in 2 4 year intervals using the same modeling framework that produced the percent biomass maps legaard 2018 reference data were obtained from visual interpretation of satellite images and air photos disturbance occurrence and from re measured fia plots basal area removed potential predictor variables were derived from landsat multispectral scanner mss and tm images user s and producer s accuracies ranged from 86 92 and 78 87 respectively across the intervals for cells that had received a stand replacing harvest which we defined as 70 basal area removal age was assigned based on time since harvest i e 5 40 years old for the remaining cells which were a combination of cells with no history of harvest 1973 2010 and those that had received a partial harvest i e harvest resulting in 70 biomass removal at the cell level we assigned overstory age randomly to contiguous neighborhoods in conformance with the age distribution for fia plots in our study area with stand age 40 years old finally for a given species we assigned understory cohorts randomly to the subset of cells in which a species occurred based on the proportion of fia plots with 2 54 cm 1 inch trees of a given species that also had seedlings of that species a spatial resolution of 30 m was retained throughout the mapping processes ultimately the total number of unique combinations of species age cohorts i e initial communities modeled was 9 273 2 4 model parameterization and calibration 2 4 1 succession for each species landis ii users must also provide values for general life history characteristics as well as growth related parameters to model succession and live aboveground biomass agb with the biomass succession extension we derived species specific values for life history traits from the peer reviewed literature including previous landis ii studies with respect to growth agb for a cohort is modeled as a function of annual net primary productivity anpp and mortality scheller and mladenoff 2004 sensitivity analyses have determined that predictions of agb using biomass succession are most sensitive to the parameters maximum anpp anppmax and maximum aboveground biomass bmax scheller and mladenoff 2004 simons legaard et al 2015 thompson et al 2011 we determined bmax for each species from usfs fia plot data by first calculating total plot biomass and then identifying the maximum value for the subset of plots where a given species was one of the top three most abundant we used the process based pnet ii model aber et al 1995 to derive anppmax for each of our ecoregions in a manner similar to previous landis ii studies e g scheller and mladenoff 2004 scheller et al 2008 thompson et al 2011 pnet ii is a forest carbon and water balance model that predicts monthly changes in whole canopy photosynthesis and estimates live anpp foliar and wood we used species specific estimates of foliar nitrogen concentrations mg n g 1 leaf and specific leaf mass for our 13 species supplementary table 1 and for other parameters used generic values for northern hardwood spruce fir and pine aber et al 1995 ollinger and smith 2005 climate inputs into pnet ii include monthly averages for maximum minimum temperatures precipitation and photosynthetically active radiation par we generated 100 random points within each of our ecoregions and extracted monthly values for temperature and precipitation from 30 year normal prism maps we used the open source software saga gis http www saga gis org to calculate monthly insolation values for each of the points and converted those values to par umoles m 2 sec 1 we then ran pnet ii for each point and each species to estimate species specific anppmax values for each ecoregion in the absence of disturbance the biomass succession model assumes that an equilibrium condition will develop over time as annual age related mortality increases and eventually offsets annual growth as a cohort approaches bmax two shape parameters interact with anppmax and bmax the growth shape parameter r determines the age at which a species achieves anppmax and the mortality shape parameter d expresses the relationship between age related mortality and bmax as a cohort nears its longevity age these shape parameters which range from 0 1 0 r and 5 25 d have no empirical basis but can used be to express relative differences in life history strategies between species e g faster growth by less shade tolerant species in a high light environment projections of aboveground biomass particularly initial biomass and in the first few simulated intervals can be especially sensitive to small changes in r thompson et al 2011 simons legaard et al 2015 so we adopted a conservative approach ultimately setting r 0 62 0 87 and d 9 15 over a relatively narrow range across species finally the model includes an additional calibration parameter i e spin up mortality fraction that can be used to modify agb estimation during the model spin up phase to better align initial estimates with available reference data we incrementally increased this parameter from zero with the goal of matching the total agb projected at year 0 to the estimate for our study area calculated from fia data 2006 2010 in addition to cohort growth landis ii models the establishment of new cohorts any reproductively mature cohort within a user specified neighborhood can act as a potential seed source but the probability of successful dispersal to a cell declines rapidly with distance from source mladenoff and he 1999 ward et al 2005 given a seed source the likelihood of success is determined by a species shade tolerance and the probability of establishment pest as specified by the user pest ranges from 0 01 1 and can be varied by ecoregion he et al 1999 mladenoff and he 1999 we estimated pest separately for lowland and upland forest as defined in the ecoregion map see section 2 3 by comparing the number of fia plots with seedlings of a given species to the number of plots with seedlings and 2 54 cm 1 inch saplings of that species to evaluate our initialization parameterization and calibration of the biomass succession extension we performed a multi scale comparison of biomass estimates from fia data 2006 2010 to landis ii predictions at year 0 the fia sampling design provides approximately one sample location every 2 428 ha or 6 000 ac across the u s we first generated a tessellated dataset of 2 428 ha squares overlapping our study area in arcmap and then identified the fia plot nearest to each square s center for each square we estimated total agb based on the identified fia plot scaled to the 2 428 ha square and compared it to total agb predicted by landis ii for the same area i e summing the 30 m cell level predictions within the 2 428 ha square we then systematically combined neighboring squares 3 3 6 6 12 12 24 24 into square areas of increasing size 21 852 ha 87 408 ha 349 632 ha 1 398 528 ha and compared fia and landis ii estimates at each scale using a pearson s correlation coefficient finally we compared the relative abundance at year 0 for the 13 species between fia and landis ii for the study area although it is relatively common to compare landis ii predictions to fia plot data comparisons are generally only made at the level of the individual plot or the entire study area which can obscure scale dependent patterns of disagreement 2 4 2 disturbance calibration of disturbance extensions generally focuses on relevant literature for the region of interest to specify disturbance characteristics such as frequency size and intensity for example we calibrated the base wind extension to simulate a 0 1 rate of annual area disturbed by small to moderate wind events lorimer 1977 lorimer and white 2003 seymour et al 2002 when calibrating the biomass harvest extension previous studies including the afr have used regional estimates of harvest rates derived from fia plot data duveneck and thompson 2019 wang et al 2017 in contrast we were able to use the local spatially explicit information provided by the landsat forest disturbance time series developed for our study area for this we first delineated management units based on a map of land ownership boundaries ca 2010 which encompassed 500 parcels and 80 landowners ownerships ranged in size from 1 km2 to 4 162 km2 in addition to commercially managed forest our study area included 179 000 ha of publicly or privately owned forest managed as preserves and 82 000 ha of forest we identified as inaccessible or ineligible for timber harvest due to elevation or slope based on current state regulations we then estimated the annual area harvested for each landowner based on the observed harvest areas in the three most recent intervals i e 2001 2004 2004 2007 2007 2010 in the forest disturbance times series estimated rates varied widely between landowners ranging from 1 to 8 2 of forested area per year with a study wide average of 2 2 sd 1 6 based on each landowner s average harvest rate the resulting cumulative target area was 768 379 ha to be harvested every 10 years harvesting in landis ii is based on control of harvest area not volume harvest area targets for each landowner in our modeled system were assigned to two prescriptions clearcut or partial harvest partial harvesting represents 90 of the harvests in maine according to self reporting by maine landowners to the maine forest service maine forest service 2020 we designed our partial harvest prescription to be variable in intensity based on a post harvest survey in our study area by rice et al 2012 which determined that on average the area of a partial harvest is comprised of 35 complete overstory removal predominantly in trails and landings and 45 partial overstory removal our partial harvest prescription was implemented as a 2 stage harvest across consecutive periods selected stands first received a patch cut treatment to approximate trails targeting 40 of the stand area followed in the next period by a uniform selection cut of the remaining stand area with removals targeting primarily older cohorts the clearcut prescription was designed to remove all but seedlings clearcuts were only assigned to a portion of landowners with a recent history of conducting stand replacing harvests we also calibrated target rates to maintain an annual average clearcut rate across ownerships of approximately 4 in accordance with annual landowner harvest reports to the maine forest service maine forest service 2020 when identifying stands for use in the biomass harvest extension our minimum mapping unit was 9 cells or approximately 1 ha 2 5 scenario design and data analysis we simulated forest growth and succession with and without timber harvesting our start date was 2010 based on the initialization data total duration for simulations with timber harvesting was 50 years reflecting a typical strategic planning horizon in our region total duration for simulations without timber harvesting i e succession only was 150 years we compared results between simulations with and without timber harvesting at 50 years for simulations without timber harvesting we also compared results at year 50 to year 150 to further verify our calibration of the biomass succession extension regarding the longer term outcomes of competitive species interactions and to better understand the effects of harvesting on agb dynamics our expectation was that if the model was parameterized and calibrated appropriately for our forest system the relative abundance of less shade tolerant species would decline over time in simulations without timber harvesting all simulations included wind disturbance landis ii models stochasticity in some of the successional e g dispersal and cohort establishment and disturbance e g stand selection for wind damage or harvest processes we replicated each scenario ten times and evaluated variance in modeled outcomes for each scenario we used maps of agb g m2 output by landis ii at each time step to calculate projected changes in species agb and total agb summed across species agbtotal we used the output biomass reclass extension to classify sites based on species dominance and compared initial spatial patterns to projected spatial patterns to evaluate species

predictions at year 0 i e 2010 and total live aboveground biomass agbtotal estimated from fia field plots increased with area achieving 0 87 at the intermediate scale of 87 408 ha table 1 at the scale of our study area landis ii estimated 262 06 tg ca 2010 based on initial forest conditions which was within 0 04 of the agbtotal estimated from fia plot data for our study area 262 16 tg at the cell level estimates of agb ranged widely across our study area 233 14 884 g m2 spatial patterns were generated by variation in forest age and dominant species composition fig 2 patches of lower agb tended to occur in areas of regenerating forest 40 years old whereas patches of high agb occurred in areas of residual or reserved mature forest species relative abundances estimated for the study area at year 0 using maps of species biomass from landis ii were 2 for all species compared to estimates from fia plot data supplementary table 2 simulations of forest growth without timber harvesting suggest that forest in our study area could accumulate twice as much live aboveground biomass within 50 60 years fig 3 beyond 2070 the simulated rate of accumulation slowed with agbtotal reaching a maximum of 629 4 tg ca 2130 before declining variability in projected estimates of agbtotal was very low cv range 0 01 0 02 between replicates and across intervals supplementary table 3 after 50 years without

sites currently dominated by paper birch were projected to transition to more shade tolerant species including balsam fir abba red spruce piru yellow birch beal2 and red maple acru approximately equal site turnover rates between balsam fir and red spruce were projected in contrast to red spruce and white pine for which red spruce was projected to gain dominance at many more sites other notable trends included increasing site dominance of sugar maple acsa3 and yellow birch at sites currently dominated by a variety of northern conifers and hardwoods after 150 years without timber harvesting a greater magnitude of site turnover was projected with patterns generally favoring more shade tolerant species fig 4b site dominance by the less shade tolerant hardwoods i e red maple paper birch and white ash fraxi was projected to decline the decline in site dominance by white pine was also projected to continue despite its high shade tolerance maintenance of site dominance by balsam fir was projected to decline as sites transitioned to longer lived species primarily red spruce nonetheless turnover favoring balsam fir was projected to occur at sites currently dominated by a variety of species emulating average landowner harvest rates simulations suggested forest growth will generally replace biomass removals from harvesting agbtotal was projected to be relatively stable at approximately 2 of the initial estimate from 2010 2060 fig 5 a average g m2 of agb increased 2 5 between 2010 and 2060 as with the no harvest scenario variability of agbtotal was very low cv range 0

supplementary table 6 consistently lower than the 10 year target area of 768 379 ha simulations suggested that continued timber harvesting would benefit specific species fig 6 compared to the no harvest scenario after 50 years fig 4a most notably paper birch was projected to maintain site dominance to a greater degree and many more sites were projected to transition to dominance by balsam fir or paper birch site dominance by red spruce was projected to increase at a variety of sites but it was projected to be less successful maintaining dominance at sites where it is currently the most abundant species projected to be notably less successful at maintaining or gaining site dominance compared to the no harvest scenario included northern white cedar thoc2 eastern hemlock tsca and white ash although both maples benefitted from timber harvesting turnover favored red maple to a greater degree than sugar maple projections ultimately suggested that the cumulative effects of spatial interactions between timber harvesting and forest succession on species co occurrence would be changes in the regional extent of forest types including a loss of northern hardwood forest table 2 in 2010 the most prevalent forest type in our study area was mixed 28 spruce fir forest and maple beech birch forest each comprised 18 of the forested area both were broadly distributed across the study area with localized spatial patterns associated with topography and landscape position fig 7 a by 2060 the extent of maple beech birch forest was projected to decline 31 in contrast spruce fir forest was projected to increase 7 maple beech birch mixed forest was also projected to decline 12 compared to an increase in spruce fir mixed forest 33 which expanded its footprint broadly particularly along edges between spruce fir and maple beech birch forest fig 7b other hardwood forest was projected to increase 12 whereas other conifer which had the least extent ca 2010 was projected to decline 53 by 2060 4 discussion spruce trees were once the dominant feature of maine s forests and beyond cogbill et al 2002 witness tree data tells a clear story of the importance of spruce which as a group were nearly twice as abundant as any other tree species statewide prior to the 1850s and other long lived conifers e g eastern hemlock and shade tolerant hardwoods e g yellow birch and american beech barton et al 2012 since then the relative abundance of many of those species has changed considerably with a general pattern of heavily utilized species associated with late successional forest decreasing in abundance our projections demonstrated that shifts in forest composition will be an ongoing consequence of contemporary timber harvesting in maine in the absence of timber harvesting forests in the northern afr would begin to shift back towards their historic composition with increasing shade the less shade tolerant hardwoods like red maple and paper birch would decline fig 4 eventually outcompeted and replaced by northern hardwoods sugar maple yellow birch or american beech or northern conifers balsam fir or spruce without harvesting pressure the balance of site turnover between balsam fir and red spruce would eventually shift towards the longer lived spruce although it is not as numerous as it once was red spruce regeneration and growing stock are still relatively abundant and well distributed across the landscape mccaskill et al 2011 nonetheless balsam fir is a highly aggressive competitor in this system and its abundance will likely remain elevated relative to presettlement for a considerable time given its wide distribution slowing its replacement by species that were historically more abundant under the considerably more likely scenario of ongoing timber harvesting and assuming recent harvest rates and practices persist forest composition will generally continue to shift away from presettlement conditions results support the conclusion of empirical studies in the afr that higher disturbance intensity favors establishment of species better adapted to higher light conditions bataineh et al 2013 olson and wagner 2010 in this forest system although pre harvest canopy composition is generally the best albeit still relatively weak predictor of regeneration composition within stand variability is high and developmental pathways tend to migrate away from pre harvest composition in the context of our study the 2 2 annual rate of landscape disturbance generated by timber harvesting across our study area is clearly high enough to favor species that are better adapted to regeneration and rapid growth in more open conditions compared to the 0 1 wind driven rate of disturbance that characterizes the region s natural disturbance regime lorimer 1977 seymour et al 2002 our study further suggests that shifts in individual tree species distribution and abundance post harvest will drive broad scale changes in patterns of species co occurrence and co dominance as a result the positive feedbacks that reinforce self replacement and the perpetuation of regional forest types may weaken in this respect the northern conifer type i e spruce fir was more resistant than the northern hardwood type i e maple beech birch which was projected to decline by 31 for the spruce fir species changes in species dominance were typically within group e g balsam fir to spruce not balsam fir to hardwood species so did not result in a change of forest type in contrast northern hardwood species were more frequently replaced by species associated with a different forest type e g balsam fir or red maple driving changes away from the maple beech birch type table 2 notwithstanding changes in species abundance our results suggest that timber harvesting will generally be sustainable in northern maine agb was projected to be relatively stable 2010 2060 at 2 of the initial estimate fig 5 average g m2 of agb increased 2 5 between 2010 and 2060 these results contrast with recent landis ii projections by duveneck and thompson 2019 suggesting that removals from timber harvesting will exceed forest growth causing a 14 decline of average g m2 of agb in maine by 2060 under the current climate one likely cause for the difference in the simulated effects of harvesting on agb was the higher rate of annual harvest 3 2 as well as the higher rate of clearcutting as a percent of harvested area 45 that duveneck and thompson 2019 projected for commercial forests owned by corporations in maine compared to our 2 2 and 4 respectively it is also important to note that a different landis ii succession extension pnet succession was used which may have resulted in lower projected growth rates relative to our projections using biomass succession de bruijn et al 2014 both the spatial and thematic resolution of the map of initial forest conditions duveneck and thompson 2019 used were also lower the cell size of their input map was 250 m compared to our 30 m and the number of initial communities in the area overlapping our study area was 2 257 compared to 9 273 in our initial communities map landis ii projections are almost certainly sensitive to these differences in input conditions as was demonstrated by liang et al 2013 for landis which has important implications if projections are to meaningfully inform future place based forest policy policy makers working from the assumption that future carbon stocks would be stable in the absence of additional stressors such as climate change or insect outbreaks can focus on addressing those stressors rather than considering additional regulation of timber harvesting to ensure basic sustainability a common approach to producing the map of initial forest conditions required by landis ii which includes tree species and forest age for every cell is nearest neighbor imputation e g gradient nearest neighbor gnn using a reference dataset such as fia plot data e g dijak 2013 duveneck et al 2015 scheller et al 2008 values are assigned to each pixel within the mapped area by averaging reference observations from a set of similar pixel locations with similarity determined by spectral or environmental predictors nearest neighbor methods are convenient in that they can be used to populate pixels with an entire suite of observations obtained at reference plot locations and as a result are able to produce reliable community level outcomes henderson et al 2014 ohmann and gregory 2002 however predictive accuracy for individual species can be low and subject to strong attenuation bias that causes considerable underestimation where observed relative abundance is high and overestimation when relative abundance is low legaard et al 2020 in comparison the mapping strategy underlying our initialization map which is based on a multi objective machine learning algorithm reduces the attenuation bias that leads to systematic error while simultaneously maintaining high overall accuracy as demonstrated by legaard et al 2020 this approach is capable of achieving lower total error for individual species 9 44 reduction of rmse relative to gnn and much lower systematic error 40 69 reduction of systematic rmse relative to gnn while also reproducing observed frequencies of species dominance codominance to a level approaching that of the gnn method i e 6 maximum absolute difference between observed and predicted frequencies of dominance codominance compared to 4 for gnn on the basis of maps generated using those methods we were able to obtain estimates of initial biomass and species relative abundance for the study area from landis ii that compared very well to fia plot data more importantly our scaled comparison table 1 demonstrated that our agb estimates are robust at scales relevant to landscape scale forest management flms like landis ii were designed to simulate forest dynamics as emergent properties of process interactions gustafson 2013 rather than being based on predetermined pathways that follow observed patterns of community assembly empirical data are used to define relationships that drive tree growth and competition the strength of a flm lies in its lack of determinism and its ability to model ecological interactions in both space and time across large areas as we observed however and has been previously noted e g thompson et al 2011 duveneck et al 2014 outcome variability between replicates of a particular scenario tends to be low with respect to simulations without harvesting 150 years may not have been long enough for divergence to occur between runs given that our forest is predominantly mid successional at present and many of the tree species are long lived xu et al 2009 we expected higher variability between replicates under the harvest scenario because of the added disturbance particularly given the variation in annual harvest rate across owners i e from 1 to 8 the lack of variation cv range 0 03 0 04 however suggests that there was a high degree of similarity in which stands were selected for harvest between runs and little variability in which species established in a given harvested area in effect over the course of each model run all forest available for harvest was harvested at some point it is important to also note that simulated area harvested was also consistently lower 6 16 across runs than our prescribed targets thus our projections should be considered optimistic having knowledge of the degree to which landis ii simulations of harvesting adhered to prescriptions and produced intended outcomes is an important but rarely reported detail for interpreting projection results particularly when comparing outcomes from alternative forest management strategies our goal was to model local landscape and regional forest dynamics across the large working forest of the northern afr although our results were based on the best available information about timber harvesting rates and patterns in this region projections may not represent the future land use regime in a changing climate increasing co2 and a longer growing season are expected to boost forest productivity in the afr wang et al 2017 duveneck and thompson 2019 but effects will vary by species which may influence foresters decisions about which species to target as growing stock nonetheless because timber harvesting is the dominant disturbance factor regionally brown et al 2018 and nationally harris et al 2016 we saw value in an exclusive focus on land use as others in our region have focused on projecting climate change and forest growth in the absence of land use duveneck et al 2017 this also provided an opportunity to compare different study designs across a common area which suggested important influences of input data resolution on projection outcomes and insights into the limits to which a forest landscape model can be used to inform forest managers and policy makers in a large commercial landscape in this study we also did not consider other disturbances that may become increasingly important in the afr specifically forest insects eastern spruce budworm choristoneura fumiferana clem is a native defoliator that infests maine and atlantic maritime canada on average every 30 50 years causing widespread defoliation growth reduction and mortality of balsam fir and spruce trees maclean 1980 morin et al 2007 rapidly expanding patterns of defoliation in quebec and increasing trap catches of spruce budworm moths in maine suggest that outbreak conditions may emerge in the next few years dymond et al 2010 projected that spruce budworm could cause the forests of eastern quebec to switch from a carbon sink to a carbon source our future simulation studies will include the effects of spruce budworm and potentially other native e g pine bark adelgid pineus strobi or emerging invasive defoliators e g hemlock wooly adelgid adelges tsugae in concert with the effects of climate change on tree productivity and establishment 5 conclusions our projections agreed with empirical studies bataineh et al 2013 olson and wagner 2010 indicating that species in our system which are better suited to more frequent or higher intensity disturbances e g balsam fir red maple and paper birch and which have become more abundant in recent decades mccaskill et al 2011 will continue to benefit from timber harvesting as a result broad scale patterns of species co occurrence will likely shift challenging the persistence of important regional forest types such as northern hardwood forest characterized by sugar maple yellow birch and american beech forest management that promotes regeneration of long lived species such as red spruce and sugar maple will benefit ecosystem stability in the afr overall we conclude that forest landscape models such as landis ii when carefully parameterized and initialized can provide

24576,preventing declines of native and historically abundant tree species is an important aspect of sustainable forest management but predicting future forest composition is challenging when succession does not tend to follow a well defined path we evaluated the implications of site level interactions between timber harvesting and forest succession on the regional landscape dynamics of the complex and species rich northern acadian forest region our expectation was that forest composition would trend away from long lived and shade tolerant species because rates of landscape disturbance from timber harvesting are high relative to historic rates of natural disturbance we used a novel modeling approach that combined landsat derived time series of forest disturbance to inform realistic simulations of timber harvesting across many individual commercial forest landowners using landis ii and evaluated changes in tree species distributions and abundance with and without harvesting detailed descriptions of initial forest conditions were derived from maps of relative tree species abundance developed using landsat satellite imagery regional inventory data and an innovative machine learning algorithm if recent harvest rates persist simulations suggest timber harvesting will generally be sustainable in our study area however projected rates of site level species turnover were high predominantly favoring species that were less abundant under the region s natural disturbance regime as a result broad scale patterns of projected species co occurrence shifted destabilizing important regional forest types our results highlight both the region s capacity for forest growth and the importance of accurately capturing the local effects of land management when projecting forested regions dominated by commercial ownership keywords aboveground biomass forest composition forest landscape model landis ii northeast usa timber harvest 1 introduction managing for tree species that are native and historically dominant to a region is an important aspect of sustainable forest management amos binks et al 2010 in contrast there is growing evidence that extensive or selective harvesting has contributed to an unmixing or homogenization of many of the mixed conifer deciduous forests of the northern u s and southern canada amatangelo et al 2011 boucher et al 2009 hanberry et al 2013 in these situations long lived shade tolerant conifers associated with late succession are usually the losers while less shade tolerant typically broad leaved trees associated with early succession are often the winners in the mixed laurentian forests of the great lakes st lawrence region for example many areas historically dominated by site limited conifers like eastern hemlock tsuga canadensis have shifted towards dominance by adaptable hardwoods such as red maple acer rubrum following high intensity harvesting amatangelo et al 2011 boucher et al 2009 these regional shifts in species composition coupled with a reduction in forest diversity threaten forest resilience particularly in landscapes facing a complex assembly of threats e g climate change insect outbreaks invasive species messier et al 2019 predicting how harvesting will influence succession thereby making it possible to avoid unwanted species shifts can be a significant challenge for forest managers however particularly when they are reliant on natural regeneration and the conditions that ensure self replacement of desired species are limited gould et al 2005 taylor et al 2009 within the acadian forest region afr of northeastern u s longitudinal studies suggest that maintaining some native conifers in northern mixedwood forests will be challenging even with targeted or intensive management bataineh et al 2013 olson and wagner 2010 although the afr shares many tree species in common with the great lakes st lawrence region an important distinguishing feature of the afr is the presence of red spruce picea rubens sarg pre settlement forests in maine for example were dominated by red spruce and other long lived conifers e g eastern hemlock which often also occurred in mixedwood associations with shade tolerant hardwoods such as sugar maple acer saccharum american beech fagus grandifolia and yellow birch betula alleghaniensis mosseler et al 2003 historically stand dynamics were driven by windfall and the creation of small canopy gaps gap creating wind events occurred with a return interval of approximately 100 years large or catastrophic disturbances were rare i e 1 000 year return interval lorimer 1977 seymour et al 2002 as a consequence shorter lived shade tolerant species e g balsam fir abies balsamea or shade intolerant species e g paper birch betula papyrifera although occasionally in high abundance occurred predominantly in the understory mosseler et al 2003 in recent decades however those types of species have become increasingly abundant as rates of landscape disturbance now driven primarily by timber harvesting have increased statistical and empirically derived models are a commonly used tool in forest planning but planning for novel environmental and forest conditions will require more dynamic tools capable of large scale application although generally developed for research purposes forest landscape models flms are increasingly being used for decision support because they can simulate forest response to changing conditions gustafson et al 2011 flms that are phenomenological and stochastic are particularly well suited to application to forest systems in which succession at a given site does not tend to follow a well defined path but rather has many potential endpoints previous studies of regional forest dynamics using an flm have included the afr duveneck et al 2017 duveneck and thompson 2019 wang et al 2017 but in each the effects of timber harvesting were either ignored in lieu of focusing on climate change or generalized based on broad scale information about harvest rates harris et al 2016 timber harvesting is however the dominant forest disturbance factor in northeastern forests brown et al 2018 and in the u s the spatial resolution of the projections was also coarse 250 m or 270 m forest projections that discount the spatially varied and temporally dynamic effects of timber harvesting in northeastern forests particularly those areas dominated by commercial forestlands potentially obscure important details about local feedbacks as well as cross scale interactions affecting regional processes the goal of our study was to better understand the regional implications of local interactions between timber harvesting and forest succession for the afr our primary research objectives were to use a novel implementation of the landis ii flm to expressly emulate recently observed harvest rates and patterns across individual landowners in maine and to project cumulative changes in future tree species distributions and abundance stemming from land use and forest dynamics regionally maine has the highest harvest rates in the afr brown et al 2018 canham et al 2013 duveneck and thompson 2019 in northern maine land is almost entirely owned by commercial forest companies and forest management is almost entirely dependent on partial harvesting and natural regeneration bataineh et al 2013 brissette 1996 canham et al 2013 locally the median annual harvested area in that region is approximately 2 with substantial spatiotemporal variation between landowners which has resulted in distinct landscape scale patterns associated with forest composition and age legaard et al 2015 our expectation was that under the current forest management regime total live aboveground biomass would remain relatively steady but species relative abundances would change with a decline in long lived shade tolerant species such as red spruce olson and wagner 2010 2 methods 2 1 study area we evaluated land use and forest dynamics across a study area that encompassed approximately 30 760 km2 of the afr in maine 67 76 70 61 e 45 16 47 44 n fig 1 virtually all forestland in this area is considered commercially productive and approximately 90 is private primarily owned by large 40 km2 landowners with highly contrasting management objectives including industrial forest products

throughout this region mcwilliams et al 2005 climate in this region is characterized by warm humid summers and cold snowy winters erosion and glaciation have shaped the topography which is mostly flat or rolling with elevations ranging from sea level to over 1 500 m seymour 1995 maine is covered by an extensive network of rivers streams lakes swamps and wetlands forest type distributions are generally associated with topographically related climate and soil gradients seymour 1995 commonly occurring tree species include balsam fir abies balsamea white picea glauca red p rubens and black p

regeneration is often highly abundant in this region with high species richness high stem densities and limited effects of herbivory bose et al 2016 2 2 forest landscape model we modeled forest change using landis ii version 6 0 landis ii and its predecessor landis have both been described extensively in the literature mladenoff et al 1996 mladenoff and he 1999 mladenoff 2004 scheller and mladenoff 2004 scheller et al 2007 landis ii is a raster based forest landscape model a landscape is represented by a grid of cells aggregated by user defined ecoregions the successional processes of tree establishment growth and mortality are simulated for each cell at the level of tree cohorts characterized by species and age multiple cohorts can be present in a cell and inter cohort competition is driven by life history attributes e g shade tolerance longevity regeneration strategy cells are spatially linked by the processes of seed dispersal and disturbance the landis ii software system is composed of a core program and user selected extensions that have been developed to simulate a variety of disturbances we used the biomass succession extension version 3 1 1 scheller and mladenoff 2004 to simulate succession the biomass harvest extension version 2 1 gustafson et al 2000 to simulate timber harvesting and the base wind scheller and mladenoff 2004 to simulate wind events extensions can be run with different temporal intervals we used a 5 year time step for all based on past experience and a global sensitivity analysis of landis ii simons legaard et al 2015 a novel formulation of parameterizing and initialization was used to ensure robust model behavior as described below 2 3 model initialization landis ii requires as part of its initialization two input maps ecoregions and initial forest conditions and accompanying text files for both ecoregions and initial conditions we used observations and measurements collected at us forest service usfs forest inventory and analysis fia field plots within our study area 2006 2010 n 1 521 as reference data we derived our ecoregions from a combination of climate zones delineated by briggs and lemin 1992 and dem derived slope to capture the effects of relative landscape position on individual species establishment see section 2 4 1 the majority of fia plots in our study area are categorized as mesic occurring either in flat lowlands condition table physiographic class code or physclcd 21 or hilly upland areas physclcd 22 percent slope is recorded for each subplot subplot table and to identify a threshold slope to use for classifying all forest within our study area as lowland or upland we calculated the value at which histograms of slope grouped by the two physclcd categories intersected i e 5 slope we combined our upland lowland delineation with the 3 major climate zones associated with our study area for a total of 6 ecoregions initial forest conditions are provided by the user in the form of a thematic map and associated text file which landis ii uses to populate each cell with information about species presence and forest age for each cell we determined which species were present in high relative abundance using maps of percent biomass live aboveground percent biomass ca 2010 was modeled and mapped for each of the 13 most abundant species in our study area supplementary table 1 following the methods of legaard et al 2020 predictive models were constructed for each species using support vector machines svms with model specification determined by a multi objective genetic algorithm ga designed to simultaneously minimize total prediction error and systematic error estimates of percent biomass from fia plots were used as reference and potential predictor variables included spectral variables from landsat thematic mapper tm images acquired throughout the growing season i e late april through mid october terrain variables generated from the national elevation dataset and national hydrography dataset and climatological variables obtained from the usfs rocky mountain research station rehfeldt 2006 using the cross validation procedure described by legaard et al 2020 rmse root mean squared error and systematic rmse for the final models ranged from 4 17 and 0 5 3 respectively across species from the 13 percent biomass maps we 1 identified the 3 most abundant species for each cell 2 rescaled percent abundances for those 3 species to sum to 100 and 3 assigned cohorts to species based on relative abundance i e 1 33 1 cohort 33 66 2 cohorts and 66 100 3 cohorts if for example after rescaling the relative abundances of the top 3 species in a given cell were 60 30 and 10 they were assigned 2 1 and 1 cohort s respectively this strategy ensured that cohort assignment to a cell represented relative species abundance based on empirical data maintained dominant patterns of species co occurrence and resulted in a total number of cohorts that was computationally tractable for simulations we assigned age s to each species cohort based on disturbance history and fia plot data forest disturbance and basal area removal were mapped for our study area from 1973 to 2010 in 2 4 year intervals using the same modeling framework that produced the percent biomass maps legaard 2018 reference data were obtained from visual interpretation of satellite images and air photos disturbance occurrence and from re measured fia plots basal area removed potential predictor variables were derived from landsat multispectral scanner mss and tm images user s and producer s accuracies ranged from 86 92 and 78 87 respectively across the intervals for cells that had received a stand replacing harvest which we defined as 70 basal area removal age was assigned based on time since harvest i e 5 40 years old for the remaining cells which were a combination of cells with no history of harvest 1973 2010 and those that had received a partial harvest i e harvest resulting in 70 biomass removal at the cell level we assigned overstory age randomly to contiguous neighborhoods in conformance with the age distribution for fia plots in our study area with stand age 40 years old finally for a given species we assigned understory cohorts randomly to the subset of cells in which a species occurred based on the proportion of fia plots with 2 54 cm 1 inch trees of a given species that also had seedlings of that species a spatial resolution of 30 m was retained throughout the mapping processes ultimately the total number of unique combinations of species age cohorts i e initial communities modeled was 9 273 2 4 model parameterization and calibration 2 4 1 succession for each species landis ii users must also provide values for general life history characteristics as well as growth related parameters to model succession and live aboveground biomass agb with the biomass succession extension we derived species specific values for life history traits from the peer reviewed literature including previous landis ii studies with respect to growth agb for a cohort is modeled as a function of annual net primary productivity anpp and mortality scheller and mladenoff 2004 sensitivity analyses have determined that predictions of agb using biomass succession are most sensitive to the parameters maximum anpp anppmax and maximum aboveground biomass bmax scheller and mladenoff 2004 simons legaard et al 2015 thompson et al 2011 we determined bmax for each species from usfs fia plot data by first calculating total plot biomass and then identifying the maximum value for the subset of plots where a given species was one of the top three most abundant we used the process based pnet ii model aber et al 1995 to derive anppmax for each of our ecoregions in a manner similar to previous landis ii studies e g scheller and mladenoff 2004 scheller et al 2008 thompson et al 2011 pnet ii is a forest carbon and water balance model that predicts monthly changes in whole canopy photosynthesis and estimates live anpp foliar and wood we used species specific estimates of foliar nitrogen concentrations mg n g 1 leaf and specific leaf mass for our 13 species supplementary table 1 and for other parameters used generic values for northern hardwood spruce fir and pine aber et al 1995 ollinger and smith 2005 climate inputs into pnet ii include monthly averages for maximum minimum temperatures precipitation and photosynthetically active radiation par we generated 100 random points within each of our ecoregions and extracted monthly values for temperature and precipitation from 30 year normal prism maps we used the open source software saga gis http www saga gis org to calculate monthly insolation values for each of the points and converted those values to par umoles m 2 sec 1 we then ran pnet ii for each point and each species to estimate species specific anppmax values for each ecoregion in the absence of disturbance the biomass succession model assumes that an equilibrium condition will develop over time as annual age related mortality increases and eventually offsets annual growth as a cohort approaches bmax two shape parameters interact with anppmax and bmax the growth shape parameter r determines the age at which a species achieves anppmax and the mortality shape parameter d expresses the relationship between age related mortality and bmax as a cohort nears its longevity age these shape parameters which range from 0 1 0 r and 5 25 d have no empirical basis but can used be to express relative differences in life history strategies between species e g faster growth by less shade tolerant species in a high light environment projections of aboveground biomass particularly initial biomass and in the first few simulated intervals can be especially sensitive to small changes in r thompson et al 2011 simons legaard et al 2015 so we adopted a conservative approach ultimately setting r 0 62 0 87 and d 9 15 over a relatively narrow range across species finally the model includes an additional calibration parameter i e spin up mortality fraction that can be used to modify agb estimation during the model spin up phase to better align initial estimates with available reference data we incrementally increased this parameter from zero with the goal of matching the total agb projected at year 0 to the estimate for our study area calculated from fia data 2006 2010 in addition to cohort growth landis ii models the establishment of new cohorts any reproductively mature cohort within a user specified neighborhood can act as a potential seed source but the probability of successful dispersal to a cell declines rapidly with distance from source mladenoff and he 1999 ward et al 2005 given a seed source the likelihood of success is determined by a species shade tolerance and the probability of establishment pest as specified by the user pest ranges from 0 01 1 and can be varied by ecoregion he et al 1999 mladenoff and he 1999 we estimated pest separately for lowland and upland forest as defined in the ecoregion map see section 2 3 by comparing the number of fia plots with seedlings of a given species to the number of plots with seedlings and 2 54 cm 1 inch saplings of that species to evaluate our initialization parameterization and calibration of the biomass succession extension we performed a multi scale comparison of biomass estimates from fia data 2006 2010 to landis ii predictions at year 0 the fia sampling design provides approximately one sample location every 2 428 ha or 6 000 ac across the u s we first generated a tessellated dataset of 2 428 ha squares overlapping our study area in arcmap and then identified the fia plot nearest to each square s center for each square we estimated total agb based on the identified fia plot scaled to the 2 428 ha square and compared it to total agb predicted by landis ii for the same area i e summing the 30 m cell level predictions within the 2 428 ha square we then systematically combined neighboring squares 3 3 6 6 12 12 24 24 into square areas of increasing size 21 852 ha 87 408 ha 349 632 ha 1 398 528 ha and compared fia and landis ii estimates at each scale using a pearson s correlation coefficient finally we compared the relative abundance at year 0 for the 13 species between fia and landis ii for the study area although it is relatively common to compare landis ii predictions to fia plot data comparisons are generally only made at the level of the individual plot or the entire study area which can obscure scale dependent patterns of disagreement 2 4 2 disturbance calibration of disturbance extensions generally focuses on relevant literature for the region of interest to specify disturbance characteristics such as frequency size and intensity for example we calibrated the base wind extension to simulate a 0 1 rate of annual area disturbed by small to moderate wind events lorimer 1977 lorimer and white 2003 seymour et al 2002 when calibrating the biomass harvest extension previous studies including the afr have used regional estimates of harvest rates derived from fia plot data duveneck and thompson 2019 wang et al 2017 in contrast we were able to use the local spatially explicit information provided by the landsat forest disturbance time series developed for our study area for this we first delineated management units based on a map of land ownership boundaries ca 2010 which encompassed 500 parcels and 80 landowners ownerships ranged in size from 1 km2 to 4 162 km2 in addition to commercially managed forest our study area included 179 000 ha of publicly or privately owned forest managed as preserves and 82 000 ha of forest we identified as inaccessible or ineligible for timber harvest due to elevation or slope based on current state regulations we then estimated the annual area harvested for each landowner based on the observed harvest areas in the three most recent intervals i e 2001 2004 2004 2007 2007 2010 in the forest disturbance times series estimated rates varied widely between landowners ranging from 1 to 8 2 of forested area per year with a study wide average of 2 2 sd 1 6 based on each landowner s average harvest rate the resulting cumulative target area was 768 379 ha to be harvested every 10 years harvesting in landis ii is based on control of harvest area not volume harvest area targets for each landowner in our modeled system were assigned to two prescriptions clearcut or partial harvest partial harvesting represents 90 of the harvests in maine according to self reporting by maine landowners to the maine forest service maine forest service 2020 we designed our partial harvest prescription to be variable in intensity based on a post harvest survey in our study area by rice et al 2012 which determined that on average the area of a partial harvest is comprised of 35 complete overstory removal predominantly in trails and landings and 45 partial overstory removal our partial harvest prescription was implemented as a 2 stage harvest across consecutive periods selected stands first received a patch cut treatment to approximate trails targeting 40 of the stand area followed in the next period by a uniform selection cut of the remaining stand area with removals targeting primarily older cohorts the clearcut prescription was designed to remove all but seedlings clearcuts were only assigned to a portion of landowners with a recent history of conducting stand replacing harvests we also calibrated target rates to maintain an annual average clearcut rate across ownerships of approximately 4 in accordance with annual landowner harvest reports to the maine forest service maine forest service 2020 when identifying stands for use in the biomass harvest extension our minimum mapping unit was 9 cells or approximately 1 ha 2 5 scenario design and data analysis we simulated forest growth and succession with and without timber harvesting our start date was 2010 based on the initialization data total duration for simulations with timber harvesting was 50 years reflecting a typical strategic planning horizon in our region total duration for simulations without timber harvesting i e succession only was 150 years we compared results between simulations with and without timber harvesting at 50 years for simulations without timber harvesting we also compared results at year 50 to year 150 to further verify our calibration of the biomass succession extension regarding the longer term outcomes of competitive species interactions and to better understand the effects of harvesting on agb dynamics our expectation was that if the model was parameterized and calibrated appropriately for our forest system the relative abundance of less shade tolerant species would decline over time in simulations without timber harvesting all simulations included wind disturbance landis ii models stochasticity in some of the successional e g dispersal and cohort establishment and disturbance e g stand selection for wind damage or harvest processes we replicated each scenario ten times and evaluated variance in modeled outcomes for each scenario we used maps of agb g m2 output by landis ii at each time step to calculate projected changes in species agb and total agb summed across species agbtotal we used the output biomass reclass extension to classify sites based on species dominance and compared initial spatial patterns to projected spatial patterns to evaluate species turnover we also developed forest type maps and calculated the changes in forest area by type forest was classified as spruce fir 75 agbtotal composed of balsam fir or spruce sp spruce fir mixed 50 agbtotal and 75 agbtotal composed of balsam fir or spruce sp maple beech birch 75 agbtotal composed of sugar maple yellow birch or american beech maple beech birch mixed 50 agbtotal and 75 agbtotal composed of sugar maple yellow birch or american beech other hardwoods 75 agbtotal composed of red maple paper birch or white ash other softwoods 75 agbtotal composed of eastern hemlock northern white cedar or white pine or mixed species finally for simulations that included harvesting we calculated harvested area and compared to assigned targets 3 results pearson s correlation between landis ii predictions at year 0 i e 2010 and total live aboveground biomass agbtotal estimated from fia field plots increased with area achieving 0 87 at the intermediate scale of 87 408 ha table 1 at the scale of our study area landis ii estimated 262 06 tg ca 2010 based on initial forest conditions which was within 0 04 of the agbtotal estimated from fia plot data for our study area 262 16 tg at the cell level estimates of agb ranged widely across our study area 233 14 884 g m2 spatial patterns were generated by variation in forest age and dominant species composition fig 2 patches of lower agb tended to occur in areas of regenerating forest 40 years old whereas patches of high agb occurred in areas of residual or reserved mature forest species relative abundances estimated for the study area at year 0 using maps of species biomass from landis ii were 2 for all species compared to estimates from fia plot data supplementary table 2 simulations of forest growth without timber harvesting suggest that forest in our study area could accumulate twice as much live aboveground biomass within 50 60 years fig 3 beyond 2070 the simulated rate of accumulation slowed with agbtotal reaching a maximum of 629 4 tg ca 2130 before declining variability in projected estimates of agbtotal was very low cv range 0 01 0 02 between replicates and across intervals supplementary table 3 after 50 years without timber harvesting projections suggest species would generally maintain their current patterns of site dominance fig 4 a with the exception of paper birch bepa and to a lesser extent white pine pist sites currently dominated by paper birch were projected to transition to more shade tolerant species including balsam fir abba red spruce piru yellow birch beal2 and red maple acru approximately equal site turnover rates between balsam fir and red spruce were projected in contrast to red spruce and white pine for which red spruce was projected to gain dominance at many more sites other notable trends included increasing site dominance of sugar maple acsa3 and yellow birch at sites currently dominated by a variety of northern conifers and hardwoods after 150 years without timber harvesting a greater magnitude of site turnover was projected with patterns generally favoring more shade tolerant species fig 4b site dominance by the less shade tolerant hardwoods i e red maple paper birch and white ash fraxi was projected to decline the decline in site dominance by white pine was also projected to continue despite its high shade tolerance maintenance of site dominance by balsam fir was projected to decline as sites transitioned to longer lived species primarily red spruce nonetheless turnover favoring balsam fir was projected to occur at sites currently dominated by a variety of species emulating average landowner harvest rates simulations suggested forest growth will generally replace biomass removals from harvesting agbtotal was projected to be relatively stable at approximately 2 of the initial estimate from 2010 2060 fig 5 a average g m2 of agb increased 2 5 between 2010 and 2060 as with the no harvest scenario variability of agbtotal was very low cv range 0 02 0 03 between replicates and across intervals supplementary table 4 harvested biomass ranged from a maximum of 64 tg during the second harvest period 2020 2030 to a minimum of 54 tg during the last

supplementary table 6 consistently lower than the 10 year target area of 768 379 ha simulations suggested that continued timber harvesting would benefit specific species fig 6 compared to the no harvest scenario after 50 years fig 4a most notably paper birch was projected to maintain site dominance to a greater degree and many more sites were projected to transition to dominance by balsam fir or paper birch site dominance by red spruce was projected to increase at a variety of sites but it was projected to be less successful maintaining dominance at sites where it is currently the most abundant species projected to be notably less successful at maintaining or gaining site dominance compared to the no harvest scenario included northern white cedar thoc2 eastern hemlock tsca and white ash although both maples benefitted from timber harvesting turnover favored red maple to a greater degree than sugar maple projections ultimately suggested that the cumulative effects of spatial interactions between timber harvesting and forest succession on species co occurrence would be changes in the regional extent of forest types including a loss of northern hardwood forest table 2 in 2010 the most prevalent forest type in our study area was mixed 28 spruce fir forest and maple beech birch forest each comprised 18 of the forested area both were broadly distributed across the study area with localized spatial patterns associated with topography and landscape position fig 7 a by 2060 the extent of maple beech birch forest was projected to decline 31 in contrast spruce fir forest was projected to increase 7 maple beech birch mixed forest was also projected to decline 12 compared to an increase in spruce fir mixed forest 33 which expanded its footprint broadly particularly along edges between spruce fir and maple beech birch forest fig 7b other hardwood forest was projected to increase 12 whereas other conifer which had the least extent ca 2010 was projected to decline 53 by 2060 4 discussion spruce trees were once the dominant feature of maine s forests and beyond cogbill et al 2002 witness tree data tells a clear story of the importance of spruce which as a group were nearly twice as abundant as any other tree species statewide prior to the 1850s and other long lived conifers e g eastern hemlock and shade tolerant hardwoods e g yellow birch and american beech barton et al 2012 since then the relative abundance of many of those species has changed considerably with a general pattern of heavily utilized species associated with late successional forest decreasing in abundance our projections demonstrated that shifts in forest composition will be an ongoing consequence of contemporary timber harvesting in maine in the absence of timber harvesting forests in the northern afr would begin to shift back towards their historic composition with increasing shade the less shade tolerant hardwoods like red maple and paper birch would decline fig 4 eventually outcompeted and replaced by northern hardwoods sugar maple yellow birch or american beech or northern conifers balsam fir or spruce without harvesting pressure the balance of site turnover between balsam fir and red spruce would eventually shift towards the longer lived spruce although it is not as numerous as it once was red spruce regeneration and growing stock are still relatively abundant and well distributed across the landscape mccaskill et al 2011 nonetheless balsam fir is a highly aggressive competitor in this system and its abundance will likely remain elevated relative to presettlement for a considerable time given its wide distribution slowing its replacement by species that were historically more abundant under the considerably more likely scenario of ongoing timber harvesting and assuming recent harvest rates and practices persist forest composition will generally continue to shift away from presettlement conditions results support the conclusion of empirical studies in the afr that higher disturbance intensity favors establishment of species better adapted to higher light conditions bataineh et al 2013 olson and wagner 2010 in this forest system although pre harvest canopy composition is generally the best albeit still relatively weak predictor of regeneration composition within stand variability is high and developmental pathways tend to migrate away from pre harvest composition in the context of our study the 2 2 annual rate of landscape disturbance generated by timber harvesting across our study area is clearly high enough to favor species that are better adapted to regeneration and rapid growth in more open conditions compared to the 0 1 wind driven rate of disturbance that characterizes the region s natural disturbance regime lorimer 1977 seymour et al 2002 our study further suggests that shifts in individual tree species distribution and abundance post harvest will drive broad scale changes in patterns of species co occurrence and co dominance as a result the positive feedbacks that reinforce self replacement and the perpetuation of regional forest types may weaken in this respect the northern conifer type i e spruce fir was more resistant than the northern hardwood type i e maple beech birch which was projected to decline by 31 for the spruce fir species changes in species dominance were typically within group e g balsam fir to spruce not balsam fir to hardwood species so did not result in a change of forest type in contrast northern hardwood species were more frequently replaced by species associated with a different forest type e g balsam fir or red maple driving changes away from the maple beech birch type table 2 notwithstanding changes in species abundance our results suggest that timber harvesting will generally be sustainable in northern maine agb was projected to be relatively stable 2010 2060 at 2 of the initial estimate fig 5 average g m2 of agb increased 2 5 between 2010 and 2060 these results contrast with recent landis ii projections by duveneck and thompson 2019 suggesting that removals from timber harvesting will exceed forest growth causing a 14 decline of average g m2 of agb in maine by 2060 under the current climate one likely cause for the difference in the simulated effects of harvesting on agb was the higher rate of annual harvest 3 2 as well as the higher rate of clearcutting as a percent of harvested area 45 that duveneck and thompson 2019 projected for commercial forests owned by corporations in maine compared to our 2 2 and 4 respectively it is also important to note that a different landis ii succession extension pnet succession was used which may have resulted in lower projected growth rates relative to our projections using biomass succession de bruijn et al 2014 both the spatial and thematic resolution of the map of initial forest conditions duveneck and thompson 2019 used were also lower the cell size of their input map was 250 m compared to our 30 m and the number of initial communities in the area overlapping our study area was 2 257 compared to 9 273 in our initial communities map landis ii projections are almost certainly sensitive to these differences in input conditions as was demonstrated by liang et al 2013 for landis which has important implications if projections are to meaningfully inform future place based forest policy policy makers working from the assumption that future carbon stocks would be stable in the absence of additional stressors such as climate change or insect outbreaks can focus on addressing those stressors rather than considering additional regulation of timber harvesting to ensure basic sustainability a common approach to producing the map of initial forest conditions required by landis ii which includes tree species and forest age for every cell is nearest neighbor imputation e g gradient nearest neighbor gnn using a reference dataset such as fia plot data e g dijak 2013 duveneck et al 2015 scheller et al 2008 values are assigned to each pixel within the mapped area by averaging reference observations from a set of similar pixel locations with similarity determined by spectral or environmental predictors nearest neighbor methods are convenient in that they can be used to populate pixels with an entire suite of observations obtained at reference plot locations and as a result are able to produce reliable community level outcomes henderson et al 2014 ohmann and gregory 2002 however predictive accuracy for individual species can be low and subject to strong attenuation bias that causes considerable underestimation where observed relative abundance is high and overestimation when relative abundance is low legaard et al 2020 in comparison the mapping strategy underlying our initialization map which is based on a multi objective machine learning algorithm reduces the attenuation bias that leads to systematic error while simultaneously maintaining high overall accuracy as demonstrated by legaard et al 2020 this approach is capable of achieving lower total error for individual species 9 44 reduction of rmse relative to gnn and much lower systematic error 40 69 reduction of systematic rmse relative to gnn while also reproducing observed frequencies of species dominance codominance to a level approaching that of the gnn method i e 6 maximum absolute difference between observed and predicted frequencies of dominance codominance compared to 4 for gnn on the basis of maps generated using those methods we were able to obtain estimates of initial biomass and species relative abundance for the study area from landis ii that compared very well to fia plot data more importantly our scaled comparison table 1 demonstrated that our agb estimates are robust at scales relevant to landscape scale forest management flms like landis ii were designed to simulate forest dynamics as emergent properties of process interactions gustafson 2013 rather than being based on predetermined pathways that follow observed patterns of community assembly empirical data are used to define relationships that drive tree growth and competition the strength of a flm lies in its lack of determinism and its ability to model ecological interactions in both space and time across large areas as we observed however and has been previously noted e g thompson et al 2011 duveneck et al 2014 outcome variability between replicates of a particular scenario tends to be low with respect to simulations without harvesting 150 years may not have been long enough for divergence to occur between runs given that our forest is predominantly mid successional at present and many of the tree species are long lived xu et al 2009 we expected higher variability between replicates under the harvest scenario because of the added disturbance particularly given the variation in annual harvest rate across owners i e from 1 to 8 the lack of variation cv range 0 03 0 04 however suggests that there was a high degree of similarity in which stands were selected for harvest between runs and little variability in which species established in a given harvested area in effect over the course of each model run all forest available for harvest was harvested at some point it is important to also note that simulated area harvested was also consistently lower 6 16 across runs than our prescribed targets thus our projections should be considered optimistic having knowledge of the degree to which landis ii simulations of harvesting adhered to prescriptions and produced intended outcomes is an important but rarely reported detail for interpreting projection results particularly when comparing outcomes from alternative forest management strategies our goal was to model local landscape and regional forest dynamics across the large working forest of the northern afr although our results were based on the best available information about timber harvesting rates and patterns in this region projections may not represent the future land use regime in a changing climate increasing co2 and a longer growing season are expected to boost forest productivity in the afr wang et al 2017 duveneck and thompson 2019 but effects will vary by species which may influence foresters decisions about which species to target as growing stock nonetheless because timber harvesting is the dominant disturbance factor regionally brown et al 2018 and nationally harris et al 2016 we saw value in an exclusive focus on land use as others in our region have focused on projecting climate change and forest growth in the absence of land use duveneck et al 2017 this also provided an opportunity to compare different study designs across a common area which suggested important influences of input data resolution on projection outcomes and insights into the limits to which a forest landscape model can be used to inform forest managers and policy makers in a large commercial landscape in this study we also did not consider other disturbances that may become increasingly important in the afr specifically forest insects eastern spruce budworm choristoneura fumiferana clem is a native defoliator that infests maine and atlantic maritime canada on average every 30 50 years causing widespread defoliation growth reduction and mortality of balsam fir and spruce trees maclean 1980 morin et al 2007 rapidly expanding patterns of defoliation in quebec and increasing trap catches of spruce budworm moths in maine suggest that outbreak conditions may emerge in the next few years dymond et al 2010 projected that spruce budworm could cause the forests of eastern quebec to switch from a carbon sink to a carbon source our future simulation studies will include the effects of spruce budworm and potentially other native e g pine bark adelgid pineus strobi or emerging invasive defoliators e g hemlock wooly adelgid adelges tsugae in concert with the effects of climate change on tree productivity and establishment 5 conclusions our projections agreed with empirical studies bataineh et al 2013 olson and wagner 2010 indicating that species in our system which are better suited to more frequent or higher intensity disturbances e g balsam fir red maple and paper birch and which have become more abundant in recent decades mccaskill et al 2011 will continue to benefit from timber harvesting as a result broad scale patterns of species co occurrence will likely shift challenging the persistence of important regional forest types such as northern hardwood forest characterized by sugar maple yellow birch and american beech forest management that promotes regeneration of long lived species such as red spruce and sugar maple will benefit ecosystem stability in the afr overall we conclude that forest landscape models such as landis ii when carefully parameterized and initialized can provide valuable information at relevant scales for working forests concerning their future resistance and resilience to changes in species composition declaration of competing interest the authors declare

24577,dispersal is an important driver for animal population dynamics insect dispersal is conventionally assessed by mark release recapture mrr experiments whose results are usually analyzed by regression or bayesian approaches which do not incorporate relevant parameters affecting this behavior such as time dependence and mortality here we present an advanced mathematical statistical method based on partial differential equations pdes to predict dispersal based on mrr data taking into consideration time space and daily mortality as a case study the model is applied to estimate the dispersal of the mosquito vector aedes albopictus using data from three field mrr experiments we used a two dimensional pde heat equation a normal bivariate distribution where we incorporated the survival and capture processes we developed a stochastic model by specifying a likelihood function with poisson distribution to calibrate the model free parameters including the diffusion coefficient we then computed quantities of interested as function of space and time such as the area travelled in unit time results show that the pde approach allowed to compute time dependent measurement of dispersal in the case study the model well reproduces the observed recapture process as 86 78 and 84 of the experimental observations lie within the 95 ci of the model predictions in the three releases respectively the estimated mean values diffusion coefficient are 1 800 95 ci 1 704 1 896 960 95 ci 912 1 128 552 95 ci 432 1 080 m2 day for mrr1 mrr2 and mrr3 respectively the incorporation of time space and daily mortality in a single equation provides a more realistic representation of the dispersal process than conventional bayesian methods and can be easily adapted to estimate the dispersal of insect species of public health and economic relevance a more realistic prediction of vector species movement will improve the modelling of diseases spread and the effectiveness of control strategies against vectors and pests graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords partial differential equations mathematical model dispersal mosquitoes disease vector 1 introduction animal dispersal refers to movements away from the place of birth towards another location for reproduction the main drivers of dispersal are related to the avoidance of kin competition and inbreeding and escaping deteriorating environmental conditions bowler and benton 2005 in the case of insects assessing the active dispersal range might be of crucial importance particularly in the case of species which damage agricultural productions unsettle ecosystems and threat human health among more than 6 million species of insects known only less than 100 are either important pests for major crops or relevant vectors of human and or animal diseases the deep knowledge of these species dispersal is instrumental to develop proper integrated pest management plans which maximize cost effectiveness of interventions and protect the environment in a sustainable way although many theoretical models are available empirical studies are generally lacking due to the difficulties of linking observations to the quantification of dispersion tesson and edelaar 2013 advanced satellite radio telemetry and acoustic are giving new opportunities to study dispersion of big size animals such as large mammals or sharks cagnacci et al 2010 spaet et al 2020 but are less useful to quantify the dispersal of small animals in the case of insects mark release recapture mrr is the most widely used technique for quantifying dispersal specimens are first collected reared and marked then released from a single site and subsequently recaptured through traps placed at different distances in a given study area pollock et al 1990 the most common statistical approaches used to estimate dispersal from mrr data are regression techniques which aim to estimate the mean distance travelled mdt and the flight range fr x of a specified fraction x of the population rather than the diffusion process of individual marked specimens other methods to estimate insect dispersal follow a bayesian framework which explicitly models the diffusion process villela et al 2015 for instance the hierarchical bayesian model proposed by villela et al 2015 for the mosquito aedes aegypti takes advantage from the flexibility of the bayesian approach and expands the frequentist approach by including three components two probabilistic models describing the spatial distribution of specimens and the daily survival of marked and native individuals and an observation model describing the sampling process partial differential equations pdes represent a standard mathematical method to model diffusion processes such as the gas dynamics and heat distribution borthwick et al 2016 in ecology pdes have been applied to study spatial temporal dispersal of animal populations in a continuous domain bassett et al 2017 kareiva et al 1990 such as the home range dynamics of meerkats suricata suricatta bateman et al 2015 and the dispersal of butterflies ovaskainen 2004 the aim of this work is to provide a pde based analytical method to estimate insect dispersion based on mrr field data this method compared to previously quoted ones allows to estimate the dispersion taking into account the daily mortality of marked release insects and the days after release time in a single mathematical equation in particular we applied the proposed modeling framework to estimate the dispersal of blood fed females of the tiger mosquito aedes albopictus during the egg laying phase this species represents a significant public health burden due to its capacity to transmit exotic arboviruses such as dengue denv and chikungunya chikv capable of induce serious diseases in humans zeller et al 2016 the species was the primary responsible of the thousands of denv cases recorded in the southwest of the indian ocean in 2015 2018 vincent et al 2019 and of the first autochthonous cases of both viruses in europe marrama rakotoarivony and schaffner 2012 where it caused two large chikv outbreaks with hundreds of human cases italy 2007 and 2017 caputo et al 2020 we expect that the proposed approach can be applied to quantify dispersal and hence improve control of diseases transmitted by ae albopictus and by other mosquito species of global relevance such as the major arbovirus vector ae aegypti and malaria vector species as well as of agricultural pest species 2 materials and methods 2 1 modelling our model expands the one proposed in lutambi et al 2013 precisely we included in the main equation the mortality and capture processes of the species of interest thus the equation assumes the following form 1 m t d 2 m x 2 2 m y 2 m μ β where μ is the mortality rate β is capture rate x y represent location coordinates as distance in meters along the x and y spatial axis from a given origin x0 y0 respectively t is the time i e days or hours m x y t is the density of the population of interest individuals m2 at location x y at time t in the equation 1 we assume that the initial number of individuals are m x y 0 m0 δ x y where δ x y is the dirac delta function in two dimensions so δ x y 0 for x 2 y 2 0 and δ x y d x d y 1 and therefore m x y 0 d x d y m 0 the number of specimens in a general rectangular s 0 a x 0 b is given by s m x y t d s the term 2 m x 2 2 m y 2 indicates the diffusion in space and d is the diffusion coefficient that measures dispersal rate distance2 time in addition we assumed neumann boundary conditions i e δ m δ x 0 y δ m δ x l y 0 a n d δ m δ x x 0 δ m δ x x l 0 this implies that we assumed neither immigration which is reasonable considering that we are modelling only the dispersal of released mosquitoes nor emigration of mosquitoes from the study area such assumption should be accounted for in the study design when selecting the sampling area the analytical solution of 1 as shown in lutambi et al 2013 is 2 m x y t n o r m r x r y σ m 0 e μ β t where norm is bivariate normal distribution r x r y is the distance on the x and y axis from the initial point x0 y0 and σ is the following 2 2 covariance matrix 3 σ 2 x x σ 2 x y σ 2 y x σ 2 y y here we suppose that x and y are independent meaning that the diffusion process is equal with respect to x and y thus σ 2 x y σ 2 y x 0 σ 2 x x σ 2 y y 2 d t in other words we assume that the movement of the species of interest follows a brownian motion lutambi et al 2013 meaning the diffusion coefficient d is equal for both x and y directions in our case the bivariate normal distribution models the probability of finding specimens of the species of interest in a point x y at time t while our model was developed to estimate the diffusion coefficient of a selected species it could also have other unknown parameters such as the mortality or the capture rate we denote the set of free parameters with θ different techniques can be used to estimate θ for instance markov chain monte carlo mcmc maximum likelihood and particle filtering gelman et al 2013 2 2 case study we apply the proposed model to estimate the dispersal of blood fed ae albopictus females using mrr field data the entomological data were collected through three mrr experiments carried out on august 3rd mrr1 n released females 1049 august 24th mrr2 n 1600 and september 9th mrr3 n 1200 2009 in the municipality of piove di sacco padua province veneto northeastern italy see marini et al 2019 for a detailed description of the experiments in brief blood fed females were released from a single site and recaptures were carried out by 96 sticky traps sts facchinelli et al 2007 distributed within 10

which is assumed to follow a binomial distribution for each tested function in addition we evaluated the root mean square error rmse for each function to quantify differences between predicted and observed values finally we selected the best function for mortality considering both measures so in this case study we remark that the mortality rate µ is a function of time t the capture rate β is

carried out in rome italy in 2009 in which the same sticky traps were used to recapture ae albopictus females marini et al 2010 the parameter α is defined as the number of recaptured marked mosquitoes divided by the product between the total number of mosquitoes released the total number of sticky traps deployed and the total number of days of mrr experiment such rate α was rescaled by the factor n a as to take into account the different density of active traps within each annulus where n is the number of operational traps a is the area of the inner and smallest annulus where a single trap was present and as is the area of the annulus s finally we multiplied the rescaled rate for a correction factor ζ to be will estimated so it is a free parameter belonging to set θ thus in our study case the set of free parameters is θ d i ζ and their posterior distribution was estimated following a mcmc approach we initially explored the parameter space by sampling 1000 values of each free parameter from a uniform distribution range 0 2 the set of parameters that best fitted the data was then used as a starting point for the mcmc algorithm we simulated mosquito dispersal sampling and the mosquito location at each time step 12h from equation 2 we assumed mosquito survival to follow a binomial process of parameters 1 μ t and m t where μ t is the computed mortality at each time step t and m t are the surviving mosquitoes define as s m x y t d s from time step t thus we verify if every mosquito is alive with a binomial extraction with probability 1 µ t given by the selected mortality function

as the area covered in a day by the dispersion process of the mosquitoes i e the area travelled by the mosquitoes the mean value of the correction factor ζ for the capture rate of sticky traps is 81 35 95 ci 72 47 88 44 see table s6 and fig s1 in the appendix our model well reproduces the marked mosquito recapture observed dynamics with 86 78 84 of the experimental observations lying within 95 of the model predictions in the first second and third releases respectively fig 1 the estimated mean diffusion coefficient allows to evaluate the flight ranges over time in mrr1 the predicted fr95 is on average 163 m 95 ci 155 171 m at day 1 and increases up to 361 m 95 ci 342 382 m at day 5 after release whereas in mrr2 and mrr3 the fr95 start from 119 m 95 ci 115 124 m and 91 m 95 ci 87 96 m and increase up to 267 m 95 ci 256 280 m and 204 m 95 ci 194 213 m in the first and fifth day after release respectively fig 2 to validate the stochastic model we compared the predicted density of marked ae albopictus females with the analytical solution of the pde equation 2 as shown in fig 3 there is a very good agreement between the analytical solution and model simulations 68 86 100 of the analytical results are within 95 of the simulated model data in mrr1 mrr2 and mrr3 respectively 3 2 mortality rate estimate the comparison of the considered mortality functions shows that the exponential and the weibull functions provide the best fit higher likelihood of the mortality data of marked mosquito in the semi field experiment see table 1 and fig s2 in the appendix the functions with the highest values of likelihood exponential and weibull were compared by means of a likelihood ratio test since no statistical differences were observed between exponential and weibull likelihood value p value 0 21 df 1 the exponential function was chosen given its simpler formulation compared to weibull the estimated daily mortality rates using the exponential function were 2 1 1 8 1 3 in mrr1 mrr2 and mrr3 respectively 4 discussion here we presented a pde based stochastic framework to estimate insect dispersal based on mrr data we tested it in a specific case study to overcome the limitations of the commonly used analytical approaches i e regression analysis marini et al 2019 and hierarchical bayesian models villela et al 2015 indeed the big advantage in the use of pdes is the possibility of including time space and daily mortality in only one mathematical equation thus providing a more realistic representation of the dispersal process which could improve the planning of control activities of human vectors and agricultural pests as well as the study of their collective behavior we applied the pde method to study the dispersal of ae albopictus which represents a major source of nuisance and a public health threat also in temperate regions in order to highlight the potential of pde approach in studies aimed at predicting the transmission dynamics of vector borne pathogens and at planning vector control interventions we exploited data from three mrr experiments during which daily mortality rates of marked mosquitoes were experimentally estimated under semi filed conditions a good agreement between the stochastic model and observed data was observed moreover given the analytical solution the calculation of quantities of interest such as fr is straightforward it is important to stress the implication that such result may have on control strategies as it may allow to tailor the spatial radius deemed necessary to target the population of interest marini et al 2019 yamashita et al 2018 in the case study the fr95 resulting from the pde approach is significantly higher than the one estimated using regression analysis marini et al 2019 i e 361 m 95 ci 342 382 m vs 250 m in mrr1 267 m 95 ci 256 280 m vs 209 m in mrr2 and 204 m 95 ci 194 213 m vs 177 m in mrr3 this is due to the inclusion in the analysis of daily mortality and time day after release and is thus expected to be more realistic the spatio temporal patterns of ae albopictus blood fed females modelled through the pde approach suggest that the dispersal increases over time a conclusion which could not be reached using a conventional regression approach marini et al 2019 the latter result suggests that in case of arbovirus transmission the size of the area covered by vector control interventions should change over time to target the same fraction of the mosquito population potentially involved in the transmission event for instance in italy it is recommended that in case of autochthonous arbovirus transmission vector control intervention i e insecticide sprayings larvicide application door to door activity are carried out in a 100 m buffer around the residence of a suspected or confirmed case ministero della salute et al 2019 our model estimates that the probability of a mosquito being within this buffer is equal to 0 88 and 0 5 after 24 h and 3 days from the potentially infectious blood meal respectively indeed the flight range estimated for all mrr experiments suggested a very rapid dispersal as in the case of mrr1 when 95 of mosquitoes travelled beyond 163 m 95 ci 155 171 m 1 day after release and over 361 m 95 ci 342 382 m 5 days after release standard regression approaches for the computation of the flight range do not take into account time dependency but model cumulative captures over the entire study period as a function only of the distance it should be noted that given the short time span of the recapture data in our mrr dataset 5 days and the low observed mortality we did not need to make any assumption on the spatio temporal variation of diffusion coefficient however in the pde we assumed that mosquito dispersal is homogeneous in space whit respect to x and y coordinates and temporally constant it would be interesting in the future to address the spatio temporal dependency of the diffusion parameter d i e individuals of the species will not disperse indefinitely nor randomly in addition we included in the model estimates of capture and daily mortality rates which may be difficult to be estimated under different experimental conditions in our study we calibrated the capture rate evaluated by marini et al 2019 to our data by estimating the correction factor ζ it is important to remark that if the mortality and capture rate are not available they can be considered as free parameters and thus can be estimated by the stochastic model adding these free parameters into the model would increase the complexity of the model finally our proposed framework could be improved by including other parameters affecting insect dispersal such as wind bowen et al 1991 cummins et al 2012 knols and meijerink 1997 raffy and tran 2005 smallegange et al 2005 provided that they are appropriately estimated during the mrr experiments indeed differences either in wind direction and force or in other meteorological features might account at least partially for the different estimates in the diffusion coefficients between the three mrr experiments as hypothesized in marini et al 2019 it is critical to highlight that estimate obtained from our analytical approach are unavoidably affected by the experimental design e g the physiological stage of marked insect the ecology of the site of release and recapture the size of study areas the recapture methods fr90 estimates for ae albopictus are higher in a study conducted in switzerland vavassori et al 2019 compared to marini et al 2019 however the experimental design of the two studies largely differ i freshly emerged adults instead of blood fed females were released in switzerland ii bg sentinel trap instead of blood fed ones were released in switzerland to focus on dispersal triggered by host seeking rather than by egg laying iii the study area was larger in switzerland 1 km radius instead of 500 m application of pde method to this dataset could allow a more realistic comparison of the two datasets epidemiological models are used to evaluate the risk of outbreaks occurrence and more generally to study the circulation possibly spatial and temporal of a given mosquito borne pathogen li et al 2021 most of these models include into the equations various parameters that can influence the transmission of pathogens such as the vector mortality and oviposition rates and the length of gonotrophic cycle e g poletti et al 2011 otero et al 2006 g marini et al 2019 the dispersal of mosquitoes can be incorporated into these models by introducing either the dispersion term or the value of the diffusion coefficient d estimated in this work in fact during an outbreak mosquito dispersion might be an important factor seventy percent of focal infections during a large chikungunya outbreak mediated by ae albopictus in the lazio region italy in 2017 were transmitted within a distance of 200 m demonstrating the key importance of the dispersal of infected mosquitoes in the spatial spread of mosquito borne diseases guzzetta et al 2020 finally our results on the dispersion of mosquitoes could be useful both for models aimed at predicting mosquito abundance zheng et al 2018 and for models carried out to evaluate demographic effects of sit techniques haramboure et al 2020 5 conclusions the results here obtained are useful for the definition of the optimal buffer on which to focus emergency mosquito borne virus control interventions i e deployment of adulticides insecticides aimed at eliminating potentially infected mosquitoes in the area surrounding the residence of an arbovirus infected person this information is crucial for public authorities as it has already been shown that enlarging the size of the area to be treated and reducing the time interval between infective case identification and the control implementation might substantially increase the effectiveness of the intervention during an arbovirus outbreak g marini et al 2019 the mathematical statistical framework developed here can be easily adapted to estimate the dispersal of other insect species of public health and economic relevance indeed mrr data are available for major arbovirus i e ae aegypti e g villela et al 2015 and afrotropical malaria vectors e g epopa et al 2017 as well as for agricultural pest species such as drosophila suzukii which damages the fruit during the ripening stage asplen et al 2015 or the beetle platypus koryoensis vector of the fungus raffaelea quercus mongolicae which is fatal for oaks lee

24577,dispersal is an important driver for animal population dynamics insect dispersal is conventionally assessed by mark release recapture mrr experiments whose results are usually analyzed by regression or bayesian approaches which do not incorporate relevant parameters affecting this behavior such as time dependence and mortality here we present an advanced mathematical statistical method based on partial differential equations pdes to predict dispersal based on mrr data taking into consideration time space and daily mortality as a case study the model is applied to estimate the dispersal of the mosquito vector aedes albopictus using data from three field mrr experiments we used a two dimensional pde heat equation a normal bivariate distribution where we incorporated the survival and capture processes we developed a stochastic model by specifying a likelihood function with poisson distribution to calibrate the model free parameters including the diffusion coefficient we then computed quantities of interested as function of space and time such as the area travelled in unit time results show that the pde approach allowed to compute time dependent measurement of dispersal in the case study the model well reproduces the observed recapture process as 86 78 and 84 of the experimental observations lie within the 95 ci of the model predictions in the three releases respectively the estimated mean values diffusion coefficient are 1 800 95 ci 1 704 1 896 960 95 ci 912 1 128 552 95 ci 432 1 080 m2 day for mrr1 mrr2 and mrr3 respectively the incorporation of time space and daily mortality in a single equation provides a more realistic representation of the dispersal process than conventional bayesian methods and can be easily adapted to estimate the dispersal of insect species of public health and economic relevance a more realistic prediction of vector species movement will improve the modelling of diseases spread and the effectiveness of control strategies against vectors and pests graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords partial differential equations mathematical model dispersal mosquitoes disease vector 1 introduction animal dispersal refers to movements away from the place of birth towards another location for reproduction the main drivers of dispersal are related to the avoidance of kin competition and inbreeding and escaping deteriorating environmental conditions bowler and benton 2005 in the case of insects assessing the active dispersal range might be of crucial importance particularly in the case of species which damage agricultural productions unsettle ecosystems and threat human health among more than 6 million species of insects known only less than 100 are either important pests for major crops or relevant vectors of human and or animal diseases the deep knowledge of these species dispersal is instrumental to develop proper integrated pest management plans which maximize cost effectiveness of interventions and protect the environment in a sustainable way although many theoretical models are available empirical studies are generally lacking due to the difficulties of linking observations to the quantification of dispersion tesson and edelaar 2013 advanced satellite radio telemetry and acoustic are giving new opportunities to study dispersion of big size animals such as large mammals or sharks cagnacci et al 2010 spaet et al 2020 but are less useful to quantify the dispersal of small animals in the case of insects mark release recapture mrr is the most widely used technique for quantifying dispersal specimens are first collected reared and marked then released from a single site and subsequently recaptured through traps placed at different distances in a given study area pollock et al 1990 the most common statistical approaches used to estimate dispersal from mrr data are regression techniques which aim to estimate the mean distance travelled mdt and the flight range fr x of a specified fraction x of the population rather than the diffusion process of individual marked specimens other methods to estimate insect dispersal follow a bayesian framework which explicitly models the diffusion process villela et al 2015 for instance the hierarchical bayesian model proposed by villela et al 2015 for the mosquito aedes aegypti takes advantage from the flexibility of the bayesian approach and expands the frequentist approach by including three components two probabilistic models describing the spatial distribution of specimens and the daily survival of marked and native individuals and an observation model describing the sampling process partial differential equations pdes represent a standard mathematical method to model diffusion processes such as the gas dynamics and heat distribution borthwick et al 2016 in ecology pdes have been applied to study spatial temporal dispersal of animal populations in a continuous domain bassett et al 2017 kareiva et al 1990 such as the home range dynamics of meerkats suricata suricatta bateman et al 2015 and the dispersal of butterflies ovaskainen 2004 the aim of this work is to provide a pde based analytical method to estimate insect dispersion based on mrr field data this method compared to previously quoted ones allows to estimate the dispersion taking into account the daily mortality of marked release insects and the days after release time in a single mathematical equation in particular we applied the proposed modeling framework to estimate the dispersal of blood fed females of the tiger mosquito aedes albopictus during the egg laying phase this species represents a significant public health burden due to its capacity to transmit exotic arboviruses such as dengue denv and chikungunya chikv capable of induce serious diseases in humans zeller et al 2016 the species was the primary responsible of the thousands of denv cases recorded in the southwest of the indian ocean in 2015 2018 vincent et al 2019 and of the first autochthonous cases of both viruses in europe marrama rakotoarivony and schaffner 2012 where it caused two large chikv outbreaks with hundreds of human cases italy 2007 and 2017 caputo et al 2020 we expect that the proposed approach can be applied to quantify dispersal and hence improve control of diseases transmitted by ae albopictus and by other mosquito species of global relevance such as the major arbovirus vector ae aegypti and malaria vector species as well as of agricultural pest species 2 materials and methods 2 1 modelling our model expands the one proposed in lutambi et al 2013 precisely we included in the main equation the mortality and capture processes of the species of interest thus the equation assumes the following form 1 m t d 2 m x 2 2 m y 2 m μ β where μ is the mortality rate β is capture rate x y represent location coordinates as distance in meters along the x and y spatial axis from a given origin x0 y0 respectively t is the time i e days or hours m x y t is the density of the population of interest individuals m2 at location x y at time t in the equation 1 we assume that the initial number of individuals are m x y 0 m0 δ x y where δ x y is the dirac delta function in two dimensions so δ x y 0 for x 2 y 2 0 and δ x y d x d y 1 and therefore m x y 0 d x d y m 0 the number of specimens in a general rectangular s 0 a x 0 b is given by s m x y t d s the term 2 m x 2 2 m y 2 indicates the diffusion in space and d is the diffusion coefficient that measures dispersal rate distance2 time in addition we assumed neumann boundary conditions i e δ m δ x 0 y δ m δ x l y 0 a n d δ m δ x x 0 δ m δ x x l 0 this implies that we assumed neither immigration which is reasonable considering that we are modelling only the dispersal of released mosquitoes nor emigration of mosquitoes from the study area such assumption should be accounted for in the study design when selecting the sampling area the analytical solution of 1 as shown in lutambi et al 2013 is 2 m x y t n o r m r x r y σ m 0 e μ β t where norm is bivariate normal distribution r x r y is the distance on the x and y axis from the initial point x0 y0 and σ is the following 2 2 covariance matrix 3 σ 2 x x σ 2 x y σ 2 y x σ 2 y y here we suppose that x and y are independent meaning that the diffusion process is equal with respect to x and y thus σ 2 x y σ 2 y x 0 σ 2 x x σ 2 y y 2 d t in other words we assume that the movement of the species of interest follows a brownian motion lutambi et al 2013 meaning the diffusion coefficient d is equal for both x and y directions in our case the bivariate normal distribution models the probability of finding specimens of the species of interest in a point x y at time t while our model was developed to estimate the diffusion coefficient of a selected species it could also have other unknown parameters such as the mortality or the capture rate we denote the set of free parameters with θ different techniques can be used to estimate θ for instance markov chain monte carlo mcmc maximum likelihood and particle filtering gelman et al 2013 2 2 case study we apply the proposed model to estimate the dispersal of blood fed ae albopictus females using mrr field data the entomological data were collected through three mrr experiments carried out on august 3rd mrr1 n

carried out in rome italy in 2009 in which the same sticky traps were used to recapture ae albopictus females marini et al 2010 the parameter α is defined as the number of recaptured marked mosquitoes divided by the product between the total number of mosquitoes released the total number of sticky traps deployed and the total number of days of mrr experiment such rate α was rescaled by the factor n a as to take into account the different density of active traps within each annulus where n is the number of operational traps a is the area of the inner and smallest annulus where a single trap was present and as is the area of the annulus s finally we multiplied the rescaled rate for a correction factor ζ to be will estimated so it is a free parameter belonging to set θ thus in our study case

ae albopictus females with the analytical solution of the pde equation 2 as shown in fig 3 there is a very good agreement between the analytical solution and model simulations 68 86 100 of the analytical results are within 95 of the simulated model data in mrr1 mrr2 and mrr3 respectively 3 2 mortality rate estimate the comparison of the considered mortality functions shows that the exponential and the weibull functions provide the best fit higher likelihood of the mortality data of marked mosquito in the semi field experiment see table 1 and fig s2 in the appendix the functions with the highest values of likelihood exponential and weibull were compared by means of a likelihood ratio test since no statistical differences were observed between exponential and weibull likelihood value p value 0 21 df 1 the exponential function was chosen given its simpler formulation compared to weibull the estimated daily mortality rates using the exponential function were 2 1 1 8 1 3 in mrr1 mrr2 and mrr3 respectively 4 discussion here we presented a pde based stochastic framework to estimate insect dispersal based on mrr data we tested it in a specific case study to overcome the limitations of the commonly used analytical approaches i e regression analysis marini et al 2019 and hierarchical bayesian models villela et al 2015 indeed the big advantage in the use of pdes is the possibility of including time space and daily mortality in only one mathematical equation thus providing a more realistic representation of the dispersal process which could improve the planning of control activities of human vectors and agricultural pests as well as the study of their collective behavior we applied the pde method to study the dispersal of ae albopictus which represents a major source of nuisance and a public health threat also in temperate regions in order to highlight the potential of pde approach in studies aimed at predicting the transmission dynamics of vector borne pathogens and at planning vector control interventions we exploited data from three mrr experiments during which daily mortality rates of marked mosquitoes were experimentally estimated under semi filed conditions a good agreement between the stochastic model and observed data was observed moreover given the analytical solution the calculation of quantities of interest such as fr is straightforward it is important to stress the implication that such result may have on control strategies as it may allow to tailor the spatial radius deemed necessary to target the population of interest marini et al 2019 yamashita et al 2018 in the case study the fr95 resulting from the pde approach is significantly higher than the one estimated using regression analysis marini et al 2019 i e 361 m 95 ci 342 382 m vs 250 m in mrr1 267 m 95 ci 256 280 m vs 209 m in mrr2 and 204 m 95 ci 194 213 m vs 177 m in mrr3 this is due to the inclusion in the analysis of daily mortality and time day after release and is thus expected to be more realistic the spatio temporal patterns of ae albopictus blood fed females modelled through the pde approach suggest that the dispersal increases over time a conclusion which could not be reached using a conventional regression approach marini et al 2019 the latter result suggests that in case of arbovirus transmission the size of the area covered by vector control interventions should change over time to target the same fraction of the mosquito population potentially involved in the transmission event for instance in italy it is recommended that in case of autochthonous arbovirus transmission vector control intervention i e insecticide sprayings larvicide application door to door activity are carried out in a 100 m buffer around the residence of a suspected or confirmed case ministero della salute et al 2019 our model estimates that the probability of a mosquito being within this buffer is equal to 0 88 and 0 5 after 24 h and 3 days from the potentially infectious blood meal respectively indeed the flight range estimated for all mrr experiments suggested a very rapid dispersal as in the case of mrr1 when 95 of mosquitoes travelled beyond 163 m 95 ci 155 171 m 1 day after release and over 361 m 95 ci 342 382 m 5 days after release standard regression approaches for the computation of the flight range do not take into account time dependency but model cumulative captures over the entire study period as a function only of the distance it should be noted that given the short time span of the recapture data in our mrr dataset 5 days and the low observed mortality we did not need to make any assumption on the spatio temporal variation of diffusion coefficient however in the pde we assumed that mosquito dispersal is homogeneous in space whit respect to x and y coordinates and temporally constant it would be interesting in the future to address the spatio temporal dependency of the diffusion parameter d i e individuals of the species will not disperse indefinitely nor randomly in addition we included in the model estimates of capture and daily mortality rates which may be difficult to be estimated under different experimental conditions in our study we calibrated the capture rate evaluated by marini et al 2019 to our data by estimating the correction factor ζ it is important to remark that if the mortality and capture rate are not available they can be considered as free parameters and thus can be estimated by the stochastic model adding these free parameters into the model would increase the complexity of the model finally our proposed framework could be improved by including other parameters affecting insect dispersal such as wind bowen et al 1991 cummins et al 2012 knols and meijerink 1997 raffy and tran 2005 smallegange et al 2005 provided that they are appropriately estimated during the mrr experiments indeed differences either in wind direction and force or in other meteorological features might account at least partially for the different estimates in the diffusion coefficients between the three mrr experiments as hypothesized in marini et al 2019 it is critical to highlight that estimate obtained from our analytical approach are unavoidably affected by the experimental design e g the physiological stage of marked insect the ecology of the site of release and recapture the size of study areas the recapture methods fr90 estimates for ae albopictus are higher in a study conducted in switzerland vavassori et al 2019 compared to marini et al 2019 however the experimental design of the two studies largely differ i freshly emerged adults instead of blood fed females were released in switzerland ii bg sentinel trap instead of blood fed ones were released in switzerland to focus on dispersal triggered by host seeking rather than by egg laying iii the study area was larger in switzerland 1 km radius instead of 500 m application of pde method to this dataset could allow a more realistic comparison of the two datasets epidemiological models are used to evaluate the risk of outbreaks occurrence and more generally to study the circulation possibly spatial and temporal of a given mosquito borne pathogen li et al 2021 most of these models include into the equations various parameters that can influence the transmission of pathogens such as the vector mortality and oviposition rates and the length of gonotrophic cycle e g poletti et al 2011 otero et al 2006 g marini et al 2019 the dispersal of mosquitoes can be incorporated into these models by introducing either the dispersion term or the value of the diffusion coefficient d estimated in this work in fact during an outbreak mosquito dispersion might be an important factor seventy percent of focal infections during a large chikungunya outbreak mediated by ae albopictus in the lazio region italy in 2017 were transmitted within a distance of 200 m demonstrating the key importance of the dispersal of infected mosquitoes in the spatial spread of mosquito borne diseases guzzetta et al 2020 finally our results on the dispersion of mosquitoes could be useful both for models aimed at predicting mosquito abundance zheng et al 2018 and for models carried out to evaluate demographic effects of sit techniques haramboure et al 2020 5 conclusions the results here obtained are useful for the definition of the optimal buffer on which to focus emergency mosquito borne virus control interventions i e deployment of adulticides insecticides aimed at eliminating potentially infected mosquitoes in the area surrounding the residence of an arbovirus infected person this information is crucial for public authorities as it has already been shown that enlarging the size of the area to be treated and reducing the time interval between infective case identification and the control implementation might substantially increase the effectiveness of the intervention during an arbovirus outbreak g marini et al 2019 the mathematical statistical framework developed here can be easily adapted to estimate the dispersal of other insect species of public health and economic relevance indeed mrr data are available for major arbovirus i e ae aegypti e g villela et al 2015 and afrotropical malaria vectors e g epopa et al 2017 as well as for agricultural pest species such as drosophila suzukii which damages the fruit during the ripening stage asplen et al 2015 or the beetle platypus koryoensis vector of the fungus raffaelea quercus mongolicae which is fatal for oaks lee

24578,the indian oil sardine sardinella longiceps fishery was observed with wide stock fluctuation ecological parameters mainly temperature and prey density had a profound influence on the growth of s longiceps and hence the production in this study a fish bioenergetics model coupled with a lower trophic level model was developed to reproduce the seasonality in the growth of s longiceps for this we have used an indian ocean adaptation of an intermediate complex ecosystem model called north pacific ecological modeling for understanding regional oceanography nemuro for marine productivity simulations the model has 11 component ecosystem variables such as two types of phytoplankton small and large including flagellates and diatoms three types of zoo planktons small large and predatory which includes ciliates copepods and euphausiids particulate and dissolved organic matter opal cycling of nitrate ammonia and silicate the prey densities derived from the nemuro were input to the sardine bioenergetics model the coupled model reproduced the appropriate growth rate and wet weight of s longiceps in its seasonal cycle in four major fishery regions such as kochi goa ratnagiri and mumbai as verifiable from the available observation in kochi the mean wet weight was 72 0 12 8 g june to september 65 4 5 3 g october to november 82 4 2 7 g december to february and 66 7 3 8 g march

mumbai region maximum weight is simulated with mean wet weight as 97 4 13 3 g june to september 102 1 1 6 g october to november 104 8 1 3 g december to february and 101 6 1 2 g march to may sensitivity analysis revealed the importance of temperature and consumption in the growth of sardine detailed model validation with available observations is presented keywords indian oil sardine bioenergetics model seasonal growth nemuro fish sardine wet weight 1 introduction indian oil sardine sardinella longiceps after this referred to as sl is the single most significant contributor to india s annual marine fish production it is an important species with great value regarding the nation s economic and ecological aspects cmfri 2018 even though commercial exploitation of sl is mainly confined to the southwest coast of india its distribution is found widespread along the entire coast of peninsular india extending from the gujarat coast in the arabian sea to the west bengal coast in the bay of bengal longhurst and wooster 1990 madhupratap et al 2001 kripa et al 2018 the fishery of sl commences during the early monsoon period i e june july with the entry of spawners belonging to the various maturity stages to the inshore waters this period is generally considered as the beginning of the sl biological year during june september the peak spawning period is observed which may occasionally be earlier or prolonged by another month balan 1964 antony raja 1969 1970 after hatching the larvae mouth is well formed by the second day and the yolk absorption is completed successively it should coincide with the critical first feeding for ensuring the survival of larvae hjort 1914 nair 1973 anon 1976 rohit et al 2018 sl attains maturity by the end of the first biological year a rapid increase in length i e about 70 of its first year length establishes during the first 2 to 3 months of the larval growth juveniles are recruited to the fishery from august to october which is spawned from june to september in a later period the juveniles are dominated due to the entry of large shoals by january and february sl fishery is gradually reduced and after that fish may migrate from the coastal waters to the offshore the next year they re enter the coastal waters for their second spawning along with the virgin spawners antony raja 1969 1970 during the last few decades wide fluctuations in this species production along the southwest coast were observed krishnakumar et al 2008 kripa et al 2018 rohit et al 2018 hamza et al 2021 ecological parameters profoundly influence sl s growth and reproduction and hence stock fluctuations krishnakumar et al 2008 barange et al 2009 selvin and lipton 2012 among these parameters temperature and prey densities are the most important determining the growth rate and metabolic activities of sardines matsuoka 2001 joseph and jayaprakash 2003 morales bojórquez et al 2003 takahashi et al 2009 the growth of sl on the west coast of peninsular india is mainly studied using length frequency data and by analyzing growth inscriptions encoded in otoliths however life history observations of this particular species are limited as they are difficult to rear in laboratory settings under these circumstances numerical models can act as a vital alternative to simulate pelagics growth study the missing information and complement the data gap that arises due to limited direct observations to study the growth of sl and its seasonal cycle numerically an appropriate numerical algorithm capable of capturing the relation and effect of various ecological parameters on the growth of fish species is required such models should further link the lower trophic level ltl to the critical fish species in the higher trophic level htl generally ltl models are developed to analyze the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and plankton productions these models consider the htl as only for mortality parameterization on the planktonic species without explicit numerical simulation fennel and neumann 2004 conversely most of the fish models begin with zooplankton food density as an external driving force and less attention is given to the nutrient and ltl food web connections rose et al 1999 vlymen 1977 beyer and laurence 1980 letcher et al 1996 in this perspective a model that integrates the ltl htl linkage is a need of the hour to study the growth and distribution of a fish species in a biologically meaningful way hinckley et al 1996 werner et al 1996 hermann et al 2001 the north pacific ecosystem model for understanding regional oceanography nemuro is a well known ltl model with an added fish bioenergetics module called nemuro fish kishi et al 2007 megrey et al 2007a the ltl nemuro model has been applied to a variety of locations in the global oceans it simulates the daily predator prey interactions and biogeochemical cycling of nutrients yamanaka et al 2004 kishi et al 2004 its recent adaptation for the arabian sea is documented in anju et al 2020 simultaneously the nemuro fish is used to study the growth and population dynamics of a variety of commercially important species such as pacific saury cololabis saira pacific herrings clupea harengus pallasi and japanese sardine sardinops melanostictus ito et al 2004 megrey et al 2007b okunishi et al 2009 okunishi et al 2012 this model is also used to simulate fish growth in different geographical locations and compare the environmental aspects and growth responses without considering migration rose et al 2007 megrey et al 2007a a fish bioenergetics model connecting ltl htl linkage is not attempted to indian ocean regions for any fish species to the best of our knowledge therefore as a first step a fish bioenergetics model i e nemuro fish coupled with an ltl model i e nemuro is used to investigate the relationships between sea surface temperature sst prey density and sl growth at the southwest coast of peninsular india in the arabian sea in our earlier study the ltl nemuro is implemented for the arabian sea coupled with a 1 d mixed layer model and simulated the predator prey interactions realistically anju et al 2020 in the present study we extended this model to couple it with the fish bioenergetics model and reproduced sl s growth on the arabian sea s eastern coast the present study has the following objectives i to develop a fish bioenergetics model for htl species coupled with ltl species to suit the environmental conditions of the arabian sea ii utilize the model to describe the growth of sl along the west coast of peninsular indian different geographical locations without any explicit migration iii examine the seasonality in the growth of sl as simulated in the model and offer validation at selected fishing locations along the west coast of peninsular india and iv investigate the sensitivity of the model results to various critical parameters including water temperature and prey density which are helpful in the fisheries management 2 model description data and methods 2 1 fish bioenergetics model the bioenergetics model is based on the nemuro fish ito et al 2004 megrey et al 2007a okunishi et al 2009 and is composed of an ltl ecosystem part nemuro and a fish bioenergetics part fig 1 selected four locations for study namely kochi 75 57 e 10 n goa 73 21 e 15 7 n ratnagiri 72 21 e 17 08 n and mumbai 70 8 e 19 n along the west coast of peninsular india are shown in the fig 2 2 1 1 ltl nemuro nemuro is an ltl model with explicit nitrogen silicon cycles yamanaka et al 2004 it has been tuned for the arabian sea environment in our earlier study anju et al 2020 for the physical parameterization of vertical mixing nemuro is coupled with a vertical 1 d mixed layer model which has a second order turbulence closure scheme as in ikeda 1986 mellor and yamada 1982 valsala et al 2018 and singh et al 2019 the model spans a vertical domain from the surface 0 m to variable depths of 100 65 85 and 75 at locations 1 2 3 and 4 respectively the model configuration is executed with 51 vertical levels with different vertical resolutions to run the model near the coastal locations it simulates the dynamics of the phytoplankton zooplankton food web and is represented with 11 state variables they are planktons such as small phytoplankton ps e g flagellates large phytoplankton pl represents diatoms small zooplankton zs e g zooflagellates and ciliates large zooplankton zl copepods and predatory zooplankton zp which feed on other plankton and links between autotrophs and fish photosynthesis respiration excretion and mortality affect phytoplankton state variables whereas grazing egestion excretion and mortality affect zooplankton state variables the other state variables are three types of nutrients nitrate no3 silicate si oh 4 and ammonium nh4 two types of settling particles i e particulate organic matter pom and opal and dissolved organic matter dom the growth terms for phytoplankton in the model are based on the michaelis menten limitation kinematics the present setup of nemuro does not have an oxygen cycle and the denitrification processes associated with it the model adapted to the arabian sea environment by fine tuning of pl and ps maximum photosynthetic rate at 0 c v maxl and v maxs the light dissipation coefficient for seawater α 1 and the self shading coefficient of phytoplankton α 2 all the state variables of nemuro are initialized with constant values except silicate and nitrate which are adapted from the world ocean atlas woa the initial conditions for temperature and salinity are also adapted from woa the model was forced with six hourly air temperature zonal and meridional components of winds specific humidity 12 hourly net surface solar radiation and precipitation as surface boundary conditions the model description and equations are detailed along with validation in anju et al 2020 simulated plankton biomass along the studied coastal locations were validated with available chlorophyll a data product and shown as fig 3 2 1 2 bioenergetics model the bioenergetics model estimates an individual sardine s daily growth as the difference between consumption and the losses due to respiration specific dynamic action egestion and excretion the model formulation and most of its parameters are adopted from japanese sardine sardinops melanostictus reported by okunishi et al 2009 however some of the parameters i e temperature preference prey type and prey type vulnerability to a predator are formulated based on the arabian sea observations for some processes vulnerability of prey type to predator half saturation constant for individual predator type feeding on prey type and proportion of assimilated energy lost to specific dynamic action the formulations and parameters are specific to age group 1 age 1 young of the year and age group 2 age 2 the growth rate of a single sardine of age i is calculated as weight increment per unit of weight per day 1 d w d t c i r i s i e g i e x i c a l z c a l f w i where for age i ci is the consumption ex i is the excretion or losses of nitrogenous excretory wastes eg i is the egestion or losses due to feces ri is the respiration or losses through metabolism si is the specific dynamic action or losses due to energy costs of digesting food wi is the weight of the fish gram wet weight t the time days calz the energy density j of plankton j gram plankton 1 and calf is the energy density j of sardine j g fish 1 the parameters used in the model are given in table 1 the mathematical formulations for these parameters are based on okunishi et al 2009 2 1 3 consumption daily consumption rate was calculated by using the formula c m a x a c w i b c f c t where cma x is the maximum consumption rate gram prey gram fish 1 d 1 fc t a temperature dependence function for consumption t is the mixed layer temperature c wi the weight of an age i sardine gram wet weight ac the intercept of the allometric mass function for one gram fish at the optimal temperature and b c is the slope of the allometric mass function to estimate the maximum consumption rate the experimental data is not available regarding prey optimal temperature etc as it is challenging to do rearing experiments therefore we adopted the maximum consumption rate from japanese sardine and tuned it accordingly so that the resulting growth of sl is consistent with available records consumption depends both on the maximum consumption rate and the half saturation constants half saturation constant is gram prey m 3 for individual predator type i age group 1 and 2 feeding on prey type j pl and zl we adopted half saturation constants table 1 from japanese sardine okunishi et al 2009 2 1 4 temperature dependence of maximum consumption for temperature dependence of maximum consumption we used equations from megrey et al 2007b in the bioenergetics model maximum consumption temperature dependence is modeled as a dome shaped curve and the function is the product of two sigmoid curves thornton and lessem 1978 one curve fits the increasing segment of the temperature dependence function gcta and another curve is fit to the decreasing segment gctb 2 f c t g c t a g c t b eight specific parameters including four water temperatures te1 te2 te3 and te4 and the percentages of maximum consumption associated with each temperature xk1 xk2 xk3 and xk4 are involved in interpreting the shape of the curve megrey et al 2007b we used two different sets of the eight parameters corresponding to age1 and 2 of sardine as given in table 1 to note as there is no experimental data on this we set up these four temperatures based on the preferred habitat range of this species gopinathan 1974 bensam 1970 and values for xk1 xk2 xk3 and xk4 were tuned from japanese sardine bioenergetics okunishi et al 2009 according to the habitat preference we set the temperature dependent function to have a higher value within the range of 25 5 to 26 5 c as applicable to arabian sea conditions and as shown in fig 4 2 1 5 multispecies feeding functional response daily consumption of each age i sardine gram prey gram fish 1 d 1 is calculated by using the formula 3 c i j 1 2 c i j 4 c i j c m a x p d i j v i j k i j 1 k 1 2 p d i k k

copepods simulated by nemuro were inputted in the bioenergetics model on the west coast of peninsular india sardine mainly feeds on diatoms 60 97 along with zooplankton 25 79 with a preference towards copepods ahirwal 2018 age 1 individuals have a higher carnivorous tendency with a copepod element varies from 50 to 88 and the fish develops a preference towards phytoplankton diet with the progress of growth bensam 1970 age 2 individuals prefer to feed diatom due to the development of gill rakers rohit et al 2018 food composition may vary seasonally according to the availability of plankton based on the information available in the literature we assumed the vulnerability of fish feeding on different plankton species and the adopted values were given in table 1 in this model forage density does not decrease as fish feed continuously on the same patch of plankton 2 1 6 metabolic process all the coefficients related to metabolic processes such as respiration specific dynamic action egestion and excretion are adopted from japanese sardine okunishi et al 2009 the parameters and coefficients used in the formulation were given in table 1 we used a fixed energy density of 3800 j g zooplankton 1 for a mixed prey assemblage aneer 1980 megrey et al 2007b okunishi et al 2009 2 2 data for ocean temperature we used monthly mean data en 4 2 1 of hadley center metoffice uk good et al 2013 with a vertical resolution of 10 m and a horizontal resolution of 1 latitude 1 longitude for a period from 2013 to 2017 air temperature zonal and meridional components of winds specific humidity 12 hourly net surface solar radiation and precipitation data are from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era interim reanalysis product at 0 75 0 75 resolutions the ocean vertical velocity is taken from estimating the circulation and climate of the ocean ecco reanalysis data sets for sardine data monthly samples were collected from the kochi region a coast close to the southwestern part of peninsular indian for two years of sl s biological life further wet weight was calculated from the individual sl s length using the formula suggested by rohit et al 2018 5 w a l b where w is the wet weight of the fish l is the length of the fish in cm a and b are constants a 0 013 b 2 896 2 3 methodology in the present analysis we selected four locations namely kochi goa ratnagiri and mumbai along the west coast of peninsular india which are essential fishery regions fig 2 these locations are systems with distinct physical chemical and biological processes with significant spatiotemporal variabilities location 1 kochi the southern sector shelf is influenced by upwelling during summer june september and a relatively oligotrophic environment prevails during other months of the year therefore the food availability for sl would be less here except for summer locations 2 and 3 goa and ratnagiri central are similar in seasonal variabilities in the physical processes and the biological responses and comparable to the southern sector the difference from the southern sector is that the offshore transport of productive waters during june september may or may not reach the 100 m depth and biological enrichment happening here would be due to horizontal advection from north or west in the fourth location mumbai north sector biological production is more during summer and winter and there can be enrichment due to horizontal advection sanjeevan et al 2014 therefore the food for sl would be available throughout the year in this location among these four locations sardines spawn in the southern sector up to karwar 14 8 n sometimes extending to goa not in the mumbai region during the plankton stage movement is entirely floating along with the currents afterward in the juvenile and adult stage they move against the currents and migrate northward to the maharashtra region mainly for food and a favorable temperature prasanna kumar et al 2010 abdellaoui et al 2017 the physical biogeochemical coupled model 1d nemuro is simulated for one loop of 5 years as an initial spin up with surface forcing parameters sampled at different stations in real time we allow the model to spin up for five years since it accumulates the oceanic processes of seasonal to sub seasonal scales over five years the final spun state is the most suitable model condition for the initialization of the run the output pl and zl from the second loop of the five year run is utilized to force the nemuro fish module to avoid any systematic model drift the nitrate and silicate concentrations of the model are restored to the corresponding observational monthly climatological values with a time scale of 15 days in the surface 0 40 m and 30 days in the deep 40 250 m layers anju et al 2020 the mathematical equation for relaxation is n o 3 relaxation n o 3 model n o 3 observation τ where τ is the time scale of relaxation simulations are performed for age 1 and age 2 groups here age 1 and 2 are referred to as biological years one and two respectively the sardine bioenergetics model was driven by input data of the seasonal cycle of zone wise averaged ocean temperature assuming the fish may migrate within each zone for southern location 1 central location 2 and 3 and northern location 4 the temperature is averaged from 74 e to 77 e and 8 n to 12 n 72 e to 75 e and 12 n to 16 n and 70 e to 74 e and 16 n to 21 n respectively daily prey density pl and zl is averaged over a depth from the surface to 100 m 65 m 85 m and 75 m for locations 1 2 3 and 4 respectively in ltl model nemuro as these are the total depths of these locations further in order to account for the effects of high coastal production induced by processes such as tidal mixing stirring etc which are not explicitly represented in our model the pl and zl are re enforced by multiplying a food factor empirically derived as a function of depth from the coast as per this calculation the food factor applied is 1 25 1 55 1 34 and 1 43 for locations 1 2 3 and 4 respectively we have also simulated fish weight without food factor and compared the results a daily climatology from 1st june 2013 to 31st may 2017 of the second loop run is utilized to drive the nemuro fish the initial weight of the age 1 group was given as 0 2 g the same for the age 2 group was 50 60 60 and 80 g for locations 1 to 4 respectively a mean value of weight obtained at the end of the first year simulation of the age 1 group from individual locations provided the choice of age 2 group initial weights we conducted a few sensitivity experiments to identify the importance of various parameters and coefficients in the model to the simulated sl wet weight and its seasonality ito et al 2004 the leading term in the sardine bioenergetics model was consumption and followed by is respiration both the terms are highly dependent on ocean temperature and therefore conducted a sensitivity experiment by using annual mean temperature tave for this we fixed water temperature at an annual mean temperature in all four locations in the bioenergetics model similarly prey densities pl and zl are also fixed to annual mean values as consumption is also dependent on prey density in addition to these experiments also fixed other parameters associated with consumption vij kij ac and bc and respiration ar br and dr to 10 of the control run details of the experiments are summarized in table 2 3 results 3 1 seasonality of ocean temperature and prey density annual variation of monthly temperature over a depth of 100 m representing for the locations kochi goa ratnagiri and mumbai as zone averages are given in fig 5 pronounced seasonal variability is seen in all four locations with a maximum during march may and a minimum during september october months fig 5a b c and d the maximum and minimum seasonal amplitudes are seen at the kochi location 1 in fig 2 and mumbai location 4 in fig 2 regions the annual temperature range varies from 4 3 c from 24 1 c to 28 4 c in kochi to a minimum of 2 c 25 6 c to 27 6 c on the mumbai coast however the annual temperature range is about 3 2 c 25 c to 28 2 c in goa and ratnagiri locations averaged daily prey density pl and zl over a depth from the surface to 100 m 65 m 85 m and 75 m for locations 1 2 3 and 4 respectively for a period from 1st june 2013 to 31st may 2017 with its standard deviation is shown in fig 5 in the kochi coast fig 5e pl biomass was minimal during the period from march to may and then it shows a gradual enhancement at the beginning of the monsoon season it reaches its maximum abundance during the summer monsoon period with a peak in july with a value of 0 8 µmol n l 1 it decreases abruptly in october and reaches its background value by december the pl biomass in the goa coast shows an enhancement from july with a distinct peak in august the biomass decreases from october till december and again increased during the months of january february fig 5f in the ratnagiri and mumbai regions the abundance of pl biomass was found to be more or less uniform throughout the year fig 5g h abundance in these two locations was higher during the period from march to may and lowered from july to october compared to two southern locations locations 1 and 2 in the mumbai region uniform food was found to be available for sl almost throughout the year the abundance of zl biomass in the kochi region was minimum during the months from april to june then it shoots up to a distinct peak 0 085 µmol n l 1 in july and from the end of july it was maintained at an average value of 0 06 µmol n l 1 till april fig 5i the zl production in the goa region also follows a similar pattern with that of the kochi region but with a higher magnitude and multiple peaks during the summer monsoon season these multiple peaks are coherent with the pl biomass peaks in the same location fig 5j the ratnagiri region shows two minor peaks one in april and the other in october fig 5k the abundance of zl was uniform in the mumbai region with an average value of 0 064 µmol n l 1 fig 5l like the pl abundance the zl abundance is also higher in the northern locations locations 3 and 4 during the pre monsoon period it is lesser during the monsoon period compared to southern locations locations 1 and 2 3 2 growth of oil sardine and its seasonal cycle using pl and zl as prey sardine growth simulated by the bioenergetics model is shown in fig 6 lines the figure s shaded region represents the sl observed weight range from each of the stations in the earlier reports the wet weight continuously increases through the larval and juvenile stages in all the regions until december january and afterward it shows stagnancy in growth after that weight decreases and then increases from june to september months of the second year there are notable regional differences in the growth found in the kochi region location no 1 after hatching age 1 weight increases continuously for the first three months and after that a shorter period of stagnancy was noted from september to october after that it again started to gain weight until december january and reaches a maximum weight of 80 g then reduced until may and attained a weight of 60 g this property of short stagnation in growth is not found in the other three locations in the second year the age 1 individuals of location no 1 further gained weight during the june september period and reach a secondary maximum of about 80 g from september to october the weight reduced again to 60 g similar to what is noticed in the juvenile case and after that these individuals gained weight till it reaches the third maximum of about 80 g they are almost stagnant in this weight fig 6a black line the age 2 individuals also followed the same pattern of gain and loss in weight these organisms also attain a maximum weight of 80 g during the june september and december to january periods with a weight loss 60 g between october to november in goa and ratnagiri region locations no 2 and 3 fish weight was continuously increased from june to december and reached a maximum weight of 100 g black lines in fig 6b c fish weight was stagnant from january to february decreases from march to may and reaches 60 g by the end of the first year however again fish gained weight during june december and the cycle was continued the age 2 also followed the same pattern of gaining and weight reduction as shown in fig 6b c red lines for the goa and ratnagiri region in mumbai region location no 4 the simulated weight was higher than the other three southern and central locations continuous increase in weight was noted from june to march and reached a maximum weight of 110 g it started to reduce its weight to around 100 g during the months april to july period and stagnancy was noted afterward fig 6d red line the age 2 individuals also follow the same seasonal cycle by gaining 100 g and reducing 80 g its weight in respective months fig 6d red line the simulated fish weight with and without food factor were in close agreement however a slight reduction in fish weight is observed without food factor fig s1 the monthly mean wet weight of fish in their second year of growth is shown in fig 7 for all the locations the seasonality in the gain and loss of a grown fish s wet weight in the location 1 and 3 were found to be comparable even though the magnitude of the weight loss and gain was different during the monsoon season june to september the mean wet weight was 72 0 12 8 g and 76 8 6 7 g in the location 1 and 3 it reduced to 65 4 5 3 g in location 1 and increased to 82 7 2 8 g in location 3 during the period from october to november further the wet weight increased to 82 4 2 7 g and 90 0 3 2 g from december to february in locations 1 and 3 respectively during the pre monsoon period march to may a reduction was noted in both the locations 66 7 3 8 g and 75 5 2 8 g in the location 1 and 3 respectively in locations 2 and 4 the weight was 56 7 2 9 g goa and 94 6 11 g mumbai in june and continuously increased till january it attained a weight of 103 6 9 g goa and 105 7 38 g mumbai in january and further reduced till may 65 1 3 g and 99 9 1 g for locations 2 and 4 respectively 3 3 field observations based validations a field sample collection was conducted for two years daily in the kochi region location no 1 and we availed this observed data to validate the model simulation fig 8 during july the population mainly consisted of two distinct groups one is juveniles weighing around 20 g and the second group weighs 40 to 80 g which are consistent with model predicted weights fig 6a and 8a during september november the model predicted values suggest an average weight of 30 g for juveniles and 60 g for adults the observations show a clear peak in the juvenile population albeit with a weak secondary peak in the adult population of 60 g from september to november fig 8b however from december to april the model s predicted value has no supporting evidence from the corresponding observations in fig 8c d 3 4 analysis of model sensitivity the individual terms in the bioenergetics model were shown in fig 9 consumption is the most important term and followed by is respiration consumption depends on the weight of the fish and ocean temperature in all the three southern locations consumption fluctuated according to the seasonal variation of temperature in both age groups in the mumbai location for age group 1 consumption increased with the weight of fish and age group 2 displayed uniform consumption throughout the year the temperature did not play an important role in this location as the temperature in this region is within the maximum consumption range 25 5 c to 26 5 c consumption also depends on the seasonality of plankton density in the region similarly respiration depends on the water temperature and activity of the fish other parameters including respiration also show similar seasonal variation to that of consumption the consumption term in the model heavily depends on temperature and prey density therefore temperature mainly determines the seasonality of the sl growth in the model hence we have investigated individual parameters role in the seasonality of sl growth in the model with different sensitivity experiments as detailed in section 2 3 and table 2 the sensitivity analysis results are shown as the difference in wet weight between the sensitivity simulation and reference simulations for one whole year of age 1 and age 2 the temperature was a sensitive parameter in regulating the seasonality in the growth rate of sl in all the locations except for the mumbai region location no 4 for both the age groups albeit throughout the year fig 10 in the average temperature sensitivity experiment an overall weight gain is found for both age groups in all except the mumbai region moreover in this experiment the control experiment s fish weight reduction during the march may period was not registered in the sensitivity experiment fig 11 and label tave this weight gain could be due to temperature on two leading terms such as consumption and respiration in the fish bioenergetics the fitting of average temperature with the maximum consumption temperature range 25 5 to 26 5 c in the fish bioenergetics may lead to sl s weight gain sensitivity analysis with average pl and zl revealed that the phytoplankton biomass is more significant toward gaining weight than the zooplankton as shown in fig 10 it can be further confirmed from sensitivity analysis results with vulnerability and half saturation constants related to pl and zl an increase 10 in these two constants related to pl significantly contributed towards an increase and a decrease 10 of these two constants leads to a reduction in the weight of sl in all four locations however sensitivity is not observed in these two constants related to zl in all the locations the coefficients related to consumption ac and bc and respiration ar and br were also found contributing towards the significant gain or reduction in the weight of sl in all the studied locations fig 10 11 an increase decrease in weight was registered with a higher lower ac value in all the locations and an opposite response was observed with bc value similarly reduction gain in weight was noted with a higher lower ar value and opposite relation was noted with br value fig 11 4 discussion and conclusions we utilized a fish bioenergetics model coupled with an ecosystem model to study the growth and its seasonal cycle of indian oil sardine along the indian west coast the parameters in the japanese sardine bioenergetics were analyzed and applied to the indian oil sardine bioenergetics model the parameters and coefficients specific to oil sardine were selected based on the available observation and field data unlike many fishes the growth of oil sardine is not impaired by the process of maturation and spawning therefore we did not add reproductive loss in the growth equation okunishi et al 2009 the model successfully reproduced the growth in all four locations studied the results revealed the seasonal cycle of growth exhibited by this species with spatial variability the nemuro fish type models are useful in analyzing sl s growth and identifying the related data gaps as this species is difficult to rear in laboratory settings the sl s simulated wet weight was in good agreement with the observed wet weight from the kochi region and reported wet weight from other locations giving us hope that this tool can be used in practical applications however a slightly higher wet weight was simulated on the mumbai coast in the model daily consumption depends on the maximum consumption rate a function of water temperature and the half saturation constants maximum consumption occurs in the temperature range 25 5 to 26 5 c fig 4 and the water temperature in the mumbai region is observed in this range throughout the year the favourable temperature for maximum consumption could be led to increased weight in the mumbai region half saturation constant is another important parameter that determines consumption and thereby weight gain of the individual fish the uniform abundance of plankton biomass throughout the year as shown in fig 5h and l could be lead to the bigger size of the sardines in this region the easy availability of food and minimal energy required to be spent for grazing may lead to an increase in the weight of individual fish the findings of differences in fish weight in different locations correlate with these locations production periods as mentioned in the methodology section seasonality in the plankton density abundance biomass during june to september and minimum during april to may directly contributed towards an increase or decrease in the weight of individual fish in other regions however a weight reduction is not observed in mumbai due to the uniform abundance in plankton density throughout the year it could be also because sl usually does not prefer to spawn in a northern location as the spawning activity is mainly influenced by rain and cooler temperature during the spawning period prasanna kumar et al 2010 abdellaoui et al 2017 rohit et al 2018 usually juveniles and adults migrate northward from the spawning location for the preferred temperature and food northward expansion in the distribution of sl up to gujarat was noted since the late 1980s because of rise in ocean temperature vivekanandan et al 2009 the maximum growth during the early life stage may contribute towards the higher simulated weight in this region simulated fish weight in the kochi region location 1 was in agreement with the data collected from the field sample except for the period from december to april it could be due to the offshore migration of sl during this period during may an adult population of 60 g started appearing in the sampled population as sl re enter coastal water for spawning moreover simulated fish weight from all four locations was found to be comparable with the observed weight of individual fish reported from these locations during field collection of the sample population fish weighing in a range of 8 to 80 g kerala coast 31 to 87 g goa coast 11 to 86 g ratnagiri coast and 11 to 87 g mumbai coast were collected nair et al 2016 deshmukh et al 2016 shah et al 2014 shah et al 2019 as shown in fig 6 shade growth studies along the indian west coast are mainly performed by length frequency analysis by converting length into weight using the length weight relationship the weight of fish in their second year of growth is calculated at about 54 g afterward it increased to 60 g in the calicut region another southern location as reported by antony raja 1970 however individual fish weighed higher than this in northern latitudes as fish weighed more than 70 g in their second year and further increased to 98 g in the mumbai region shah et al 2019 moreover the maximum weight noted from the calicut coast is 100 g and that from the karnataka region is 159 g rohit et al 2018 the feeding intensity of oil sardine was also different in different locations as observed during gut contents analysis of the collected sample population in the karwar coast southern part fish were shown a low feeding intensity during december to january and moderate feeding from february to march and again shifted to low feeding from april to may however in the mumbai location feeding intensity was moderate to high till december shifted to low intensity during january to march and shifted to moderate to high intensity during april to may ahirwal et al 2018 the difference in the feeding intensity could be due to the uniform plankton availability in the mumbai region compared to the southern region as shown in fig 5 this prolonged higher feeding could due to the favorable temperature for maximum consumption and uniform food availability throughout the year in the mumbai region and resulted in the higher weight of the individual fish the simulated growth rate and seasonality were also in agreement with the field observation of oil sardine from the calicut coast in a field study reported by antony raja 1970 it is observed that there is a rapid rate of growth during the first 2 3 months and 70 of the growth of the first year is attained during this period fish attains its maturity during the first year the probable reason attributed to this is the physiological tendency of the most significant growth rate during the early stages of life combined with abundant food supply resources during this period a slackening of growth during the october to november period and fall on a plateau from january to march was observed with the fish s length it may be due to the natural reduction of growth crowding and competition for depleted food crops the paucity of favorable food items and reservation of resources for muscular fat and possibly more congenial environment away in deeper waters along with some connection between simultaneous gonad and body growth in our simulation we also noted a reduction in growth during this period it could be attributed to the reduction in the pl biomass during october to november months and january to march fig 5e afterward pl biomass further decreased and a corresponding reduction in the weight of fish was observed during this period fig 6a black lines in the months of october november zl biomass did not fluctuate albeit the reduction during the period from january to march ocean temperature in the location 1 2 and 3 was also above the range of maximum consumption fig 5a b and c which may lead to a reduction in the growth of fish in these locations during the post january period fig 6a b and c in the model these factors contributed towards weight reduction and during this period the fish may be migrating from these coastal locations to offshore and deeper waters for feeding and optimal temperature results of the control run revealed that the leading terms of the bioenergetics model are consumption and followed is respiration both are highly dependent on water temperature sensitivity experiments affirm the importance of temperature on consumption and respiration seasonal variability in temperature was found to be minimum in the mumbai region fig 5d and this region did not display sensitivity towards the average temperature notably the seasonal amplitude of temperature was minimum at this location compared to all other locations used in this study in the other three locations the observed seasonality in the growth of fish in the control run was not found in the sensitivity run and this can be attributed to the maximum consumption during the temperature range 25 5 to 26 5 c fig 4 and the fitting of average temperature in this range sardine prefers a temperature range of 26 to 28 c and a good fishery is observed within this range an offshore migration of juvenile and adult populations was noted with an increase in the water temperature chidambaram 1950 bensam 1970 prey density is another important parameter that determines consumption results of this sensitivity experiment showed that the pl and associated coefficients are more sensitive in the model compared to the zl and associated coefficients the coefficients associated with consumption and respiration was also found to be critical in sardine bioenergetics with a higher sensitivity towards the consumption coefficients in this study we considered only the growth of individual fish and in the future effort population dynamics and migration for sardine could be added population dynamics models for other species such as saury herring and pacific sardine megrey et al 2007a b rose et al 2008 rose et al 2015 are already in use similar models could be developed for indian ocean pelagics and it could be a useful tool in fisheries management and research sardine population exhibit wide fluctuation in production with a distinct period of abundance and decline along the coast of the arabian sea the multidecadal variability exhibited by this species is closely linked to the environmental parameters hamza et al 2021 nemuro fish type models could be used to analyze the mechanism of changes in sardine growth with the help of multi decadal simulations with realistic environmental forcing understanding the mechanism of variability in the production will be helpful in the policy making for the management of small pelagics in the background of climate change in conclusion we have successfully implemented a sardine bioenergetics model with a lower trophic ecosystem model and simulated the growth and seasonal cycle realistically this model s advantage is the potential to investigate the role of physical forcing factors in primary production zooplankton standing stocks and ltl connection to htl extension to the population dynamics model could be a useful tool to address the impact of climate change on biological productivity and sardine growth it can be further extended to other commercially and ecologically important fish species over the indian coast to address the variability in production and also for policy making 5 author contributions dr faseela hamza involved in conceptualization of the model and prepared the manuscript dr vinu valsala involved

24578,the indian oil sardine sardinella longiceps fishery was observed with wide stock fluctuation ecological parameters mainly temperature and prey density had a profound influence on the growth of s longiceps and hence the production in this study a fish bioenergetics model coupled with a lower trophic level model was developed to reproduce the seasonality in the growth of s longiceps for this we have used an indian ocean adaptation of an intermediate complex ecosystem model called north pacific ecological modeling for understanding regional oceanography nemuro for marine productivity simulations the model has 11 component ecosystem variables such as two types of phytoplankton small and large including flagellates and diatoms three types of zoo planktons small large and predatory which includes ciliates copepods and euphausiids particulate and dissolved organic matter opal cycling of nitrate ammonia and silicate the prey densities derived from the nemuro were input to the sardine bioenergetics model the coupled model reproduced the appropriate growth rate and wet weight of s longiceps in its seasonal cycle in four major fishery regions such as kochi goa ratnagiri and mumbai as verifiable from the available observation in kochi the mean wet weight was 72 0 12 8 g june to september 65 4 5 3 g october to november 82 4 2 7 g december to february and 66 7 3 8 g march to may goa and ratnagiri have moderate weights with mean wet weight as 73 6 10 6 g june to september 87 4 3 2 g october to november 95 5 4 3 g december to february and 76 2 6 8 g march to may in the mumbai region maximum weight is simulated with mean wet weight as 97 4 13 3 g june to september 102 1 1 6 g october to november 104 8 1 3 g december to february and 101 6 1 2 g march to may sensitivity analysis revealed the importance of temperature and consumption in the growth of sardine detailed model validation with available observations is presented keywords indian oil sardine bioenergetics model seasonal growth nemuro fish sardine wet weight 1 introduction indian oil sardine sardinella longiceps after this referred to as sl is the single most significant contributor to india s annual marine fish production it is an important species with great value regarding the nation s economic and ecological aspects cmfri 2018 even though commercial exploitation of sl is mainly confined to the southwest coast of india its distribution is found widespread along the entire coast of peninsular india extending from the gujarat coast in the arabian sea to the west bengal coast in the bay of bengal longhurst and wooster 1990 madhupratap et al 2001 kripa et al 2018 the fishery of sl commences during the early monsoon period i e june july with the entry of spawners belonging to the various maturity stages to the inshore waters this period is generally considered as the beginning of the sl biological year during june september the peak spawning period is observed which may occasionally be earlier or prolonged by another month balan 1964 antony raja 1969 1970 after hatching the larvae mouth is well formed by the second day and the yolk absorption is completed successively it should coincide with the critical first feeding for ensuring the survival of larvae hjort 1914 nair 1973 anon 1976 rohit et al 2018 sl attains maturity by the end of the first biological year a rapid increase in length i e about 70 of its first year length establishes during the first 2 to 3 months of the larval growth juveniles are recruited to the fishery from august to october which is spawned from june to september in a later period the juveniles are dominated due to the entry of large shoals by january and february sl fishery is gradually reduced and after that fish may migrate from the coastal waters to the offshore the next year they re enter the coastal waters for their second spawning along with the virgin spawners antony raja 1969 1970 during the last few decades wide fluctuations in this species production along the southwest coast were observed krishnakumar et al 2008 kripa et al 2018 rohit et al 2018 hamza et al 2021 ecological parameters profoundly influence sl s growth and reproduction and hence stock fluctuations krishnakumar et al 2008 barange et al 2009 selvin and lipton 2012 among these parameters temperature and prey densities are the most important determining the growth rate and metabolic activities of sardines matsuoka 2001 joseph and jayaprakash 2003 morales bojórquez et al 2003 takahashi et al 2009 the growth of sl on the west coast of peninsular india is mainly studied using length frequency data and by analyzing growth inscriptions encoded in otoliths however life history observations of this particular species are limited as they are difficult to rear in laboratory settings under these circumstances numerical models can act as a vital alternative to simulate pelagics growth study the missing information and complement the data gap that arises due to limited direct observations to study the growth of sl and its seasonal cycle numerically an appropriate numerical algorithm capable of capturing the relation and effect of various ecological parameters on the growth of fish species is required such models should further link the lower trophic level ltl to the critical fish species in the higher trophic level htl generally ltl models are developed to analyze the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and plankton productions these models consider the htl as only for mortality parameterization on the planktonic species without explicit numerical simulation fennel and neumann 2004 conversely most of the fish models begin with zooplankton food density as an external driving force and less attention is given to the nutrient and ltl food web connections rose et al 1999 vlymen 1977 beyer and laurence 1980 letcher et al 1996 in this perspective a model that integrates the ltl htl linkage is a need of the hour to study the growth and distribution of a fish species in a biologically meaningful way hinckley et al 1996 werner et al 1996 hermann et al 2001 the north pacific ecosystem model for understanding regional oceanography nemuro is a well known ltl model with an added fish bioenergetics module called nemuro fish kishi et al 2007 megrey et al 2007a the ltl nemuro model has been applied to a variety of locations in the global oceans it simulates the daily predator prey interactions and biogeochemical cycling of nutrients yamanaka et al 2004 kishi et al 2004 its recent adaptation for the arabian sea is documented in anju et al 2020 simultaneously the nemuro fish is used to study the growth and population dynamics of a variety of commercially important species such as pacific saury cololabis saira pacific herrings clupea harengus pallasi and japanese sardine sardinops melanostictus ito et al 2004 megrey et al 2007b okunishi et al 2009 okunishi et al 2012 this model is also used to simulate fish growth in different geographical locations and compare the environmental aspects and growth responses without considering migration rose et al 2007 megrey et al 2007a a fish bioenergetics model connecting ltl htl linkage is not attempted to indian ocean regions for any fish species to the best of our knowledge therefore as a first step a fish bioenergetics model i e nemuro fish coupled with an ltl model i e nemuro is used to investigate the relationships between sea surface temperature sst prey density and sl growth at the southwest coast of peninsular india in the arabian sea in our earlier study the ltl nemuro is implemented for the arabian sea coupled with a 1 d mixed layer model and simulated the predator prey interactions realistically anju et al 2020 in the present study we extended this model to couple it with the fish bioenergetics model and reproduced sl s growth on the arabian sea s eastern coast the present study has the following objectives i to develop a fish bioenergetics model for htl species coupled with ltl species to suit the environmental conditions of the arabian sea ii utilize the model to describe the growth of sl along the west coast of peninsular indian different geographical locations without any explicit migration iii examine the seasonality in the growth of sl as simulated in the model and offer validation at selected fishing locations along the west coast of peninsular india and iv investigate the sensitivity of the model results to various critical parameters including water temperature and prey density which are helpful in the fisheries management 2 model description data and methods 2 1 fish bioenergetics model the bioenergetics model is based on the nemuro fish ito et al 2004 megrey et al 2007a okunishi et al 2009 and is composed of an ltl ecosystem part nemuro and a fish bioenergetics part fig 1 selected four locations for study namely kochi 75 57 e 10 n goa 73 21 e 15 7 n ratnagiri 72 21 e 17 08 n and mumbai 70 8 e 19 n along the west coast of peninsular india are shown in the fig 2 2 1 1 ltl nemuro nemuro is an ltl model with explicit nitrogen silicon cycles yamanaka et al 2004 it has been tuned for the arabian sea environment in our earlier study anju et al 2020 for the physical parameterization of vertical mixing nemuro is coupled with a vertical 1 d mixed layer model which has a second order turbulence closure scheme as in ikeda 1986 mellor and yamada 1982 valsala et al 2018 and singh et al 2019 the model spans a vertical domain from the surface 0 m to variable depths of 100 65 85 and 75 at locations 1 2 3 and 4 respectively the model configuration is executed with 51 vertical levels with different vertical resolutions to run the model near the coastal locations it simulates the dynamics of the phytoplankton zooplankton food web and is represented with 11 state variables they are planktons such as small phytoplankton ps e g flagellates large phytoplankton pl represents diatoms small zooplankton zs e g zooflagellates and ciliates large zooplankton zl copepods and predatory zooplankton zp which feed on other plankton and links between autotrophs and fish photosynthesis respiration excretion and mortality affect phytoplankton state variables whereas grazing egestion excretion and mortality affect zooplankton state variables the other state variables are three types of nutrients nitrate no3 silicate si oh 4 and ammonium nh4 two types of settling particles i e particulate organic matter pom and opal and dissolved organic matter dom the growth terms for phytoplankton in the model are based on the michaelis menten limitation kinematics the present setup of nemuro does not have an oxygen cycle and the denitrification processes associated with it the model adapted to the arabian sea environment by fine tuning of pl and ps maximum photosynthetic rate at 0 c v maxl and v maxs the light dissipation coefficient for seawater α 1 and the self shading coefficient of phytoplankton α 2 all the state variables of nemuro are initialized with constant values except silicate and nitrate which are adapted from the world ocean atlas woa the initial conditions for temperature and salinity are also adapted from woa the model was forced with six hourly air temperature zonal and meridional components of winds specific humidity 12 hourly net surface solar radiation and precipitation as surface boundary conditions the model description and equations are detailed along with validation in anju et al 2020 simulated plankton biomass along the studied coastal locations were validated with available chlorophyll a data product and shown as fig 3 2 1 2 bioenergetics model the bioenergetics model estimates an individual sardine s daily growth as the difference between consumption and the losses due to respiration specific dynamic action egestion and excretion the model formulation and most of its parameters are adopted from japanese sardine sardinops melanostictus reported by okunishi et al 2009 however some of the parameters i e temperature preference prey type and prey type vulnerability to a predator are formulated based on the arabian sea observations for some processes vulnerability of prey type to predator half saturation constant for individual predator type feeding on prey type and proportion of assimilated energy lost to specific dynamic action the formulations and parameters are specific to age group 1 age 1 young of the year and age group 2 age 2 the growth rate of a single sardine of age i is calculated as weight increment per unit of weight per day 1 d w d t c i r i s i e g i e x i c a l z c a l f w i where for age i ci is the consumption ex i is the excretion or losses of nitrogenous excretory wastes eg i is the egestion or losses due to feces ri is the respiration or losses through metabolism si is the specific dynamic action or losses due to energy costs of digesting food wi is the weight of the fish gram wet weight t the time days calz the energy density j of plankton j gram plankton 1 and calf is the energy density j of sardine j g fish 1 the parameters used in the model are given in table 1 the mathematical formulations for these parameters are based on okunishi et al 2009 2 1 3 consumption daily consumption rate was calculated by using the formula c m a x a c w i b c f c t where cma x is the maximum consumption rate gram prey gram fish 1 d 1 fc t a temperature dependence function for consumption t is the mixed layer temperature c wi the weight of an age i sardine gram wet weight ac the intercept of the allometric mass function for one gram fish at the optimal temperature and b c is the slope of the allometric mass function to estimate the maximum consumption rate the experimental data is not available regarding prey optimal temperature etc as it is challenging to do rearing experiments therefore we adopted the maximum consumption rate from japanese sardine and tuned it accordingly so that the resulting growth of sl is consistent with available records consumption depends both on the maximum consumption rate and the half saturation constants half saturation constant is gram prey m 3 for individual predator type i age group 1 and 2 feeding on prey type j pl and zl we adopted half saturation constants table 1 from japanese sardine okunishi et al 2009 2 1 4 temperature dependence of maximum consumption for temperature dependence of maximum consumption we used equations from megrey et al 2007b in the bioenergetics model maximum consumption temperature dependence is modeled as a dome shaped curve and the function is the product of two sigmoid curves thornton and lessem 1978 one curve fits the increasing segment of the temperature dependence function gcta and another curve is fit to the decreasing segment gctb 2 f c t g c t a g c t b eight specific parameters including four water temperatures te1 te2 te3 and te4 and the percentages of maximum consumption associated with each temperature xk1 xk2 xk3 and xk4 are involved in interpreting the shape of the curve megrey et al 2007b we used two different sets of the eight parameters corresponding to age1 and 2 of sardine as given in table 1 to note as there is no experimental data on this we set up these four temperatures based on the preferred habitat range of this species gopinathan 1974 bensam 1970 and values for xk1 xk2 xk3 and xk4 were tuned from japanese sardine bioenergetics okunishi et al 2009 according to the

copepods simulated by nemuro were inputted in the bioenergetics model on the west coast of peninsular india sardine mainly feeds on diatoms 60 97 along with zooplankton 25 79 with a preference towards copepods ahirwal 2018 age 1 individuals have a higher carnivorous tendency with a copepod element varies from 50 to 88 and the fish develops a preference towards phytoplankton diet with the progress of growth bensam 1970 age 2 individuals prefer to feed diatom due to the development of gill rakers rohit et al 2018 food composition may vary seasonally according to the availability of plankton based on the information available in the literature we assumed the vulnerability of fish feeding on different plankton species and the adopted values were given in table 1 in this model forage density does not decrease as fish feed continuously on the same patch of plankton 2 1 6 metabolic process all the coefficients related to metabolic processes such as respiration specific dynamic action egestion and excretion are adopted from japanese sardine okunishi et al 2009 the parameters and coefficients used in the formulation were given in table 1 we used a fixed energy density of 3800 j g zooplankton 1 for a mixed prey assemblage aneer 1980 megrey et al 2007b okunishi et al 2009 2 2 data for ocean temperature we used monthly mean data en 4 2 1 of hadley center metoffice uk good et al 2013 with a vertical resolution of 10 m and a horizontal resolution of 1 latitude 1 longitude for a period from 2013 to 2017 air temperature zonal and meridional components of winds specific humidity 12 hourly net surface solar radiation and precipitation data are from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era interim reanalysis product at 0 75 0 75 resolutions the ocean vertical velocity is taken from estimating the circulation and climate of the ocean ecco reanalysis data sets for sardine data monthly samples were collected from the kochi region a coast close to the southwestern part of peninsular indian for two years of sl s biological life further wet weight was calculated from the individual sl s length using the formula suggested by rohit et al 2018 5 w a l b where w is the wet weight of the fish l is the length of the fish in cm a and b are constants a 0 013 b 2 896 2 3 methodology in the present analysis we selected four locations namely kochi goa ratnagiri and mumbai along the west coast of peninsular india which are essential fishery regions fig 2 these locations are systems with distinct physical chemical and biological processes with significant spatiotemporal variabilities location 1 kochi the southern sector shelf is influenced by upwelling during summer june september and a relatively oligotrophic environment prevails during other months of the year therefore the food availability for sl would be less here except for summer locations 2 and 3 goa and ratnagiri central are similar in seasonal variabilities in the physical processes and the biological responses and comparable to the southern sector the difference from the southern sector is that the offshore transport of productive waters during june september may or may not reach the 100 m depth and biological enrichment happening here would be due to horizontal advection from north or west in the fourth location mumbai north sector biological production is more during summer and winter and there can be enrichment due to horizontal advection sanjeevan et al 2014 therefore the food for sl would be available throughout the year in this location among these four locations sardines spawn in the southern sector up to karwar 14 8 n sometimes extending to goa not in the mumbai region during the plankton stage movement is entirely floating along with the currents afterward in the juvenile and adult stage they move against the currents and migrate northward to the maharashtra region mainly for food and a favorable temperature prasanna kumar et al 2010 abdellaoui et al 2017 the physical biogeochemical coupled model 1d nemuro is simulated for one loop of 5 years as an initial spin up with surface forcing parameters sampled at different stations in real time we allow the model to spin up for five years since it accumulates the oceanic processes of seasonal to sub seasonal scales over five years the final spun state is the most suitable model condition for the initialization of the run the output pl and zl from the second loop of the five year run is utilized to force the nemuro fish module to avoid any systematic model drift the nitrate and silicate concentrations of the model are restored to the corresponding observational monthly climatological values with a time scale of 15 days in the surface 0 40 m and 30 days in the deep 40 250 m layers anju et al 2020 the mathematical equation for relaxation is n o 3 relaxation n o 3 model n o 3 observation τ where τ is the time scale of relaxation simulations are performed for age 1 and age 2 groups here age 1 and 2 are referred to as biological years one and two respectively the sardine bioenergetics model was driven by input data of the seasonal cycle of zone wise averaged ocean temperature assuming the fish may migrate within each zone for southern location 1 central location 2 and 3 and northern location 4 the temperature is averaged from 74 e to 77 e and 8 n to 12 n 72 e to 75 e and 12 n to 16 n and 70 e to 74 e and 16 n to 21 n respectively daily prey density pl and zl is averaged over a depth from the surface to 100 m 65 m 85 m and 75 m for locations 1 2 3 and 4 respectively in ltl model nemuro as these are the total depths of these locations further in order to account for the effects of high coastal production induced by processes such as tidal mixing stirring etc which are not explicitly represented in our model the pl and zl are re enforced by multiplying a food factor empirically derived as a function of depth from the coast as per this calculation the food factor applied is 1 25 1 55 1 34 and 1 43 for locations 1 2 3 and 4 respectively we have also simulated fish weight without food factor and compared the results a daily climatology from 1st june 2013 to 31st may 2017 of the second loop run is utilized to drive the nemuro fish the initial weight of the age 1 group was given as 0 2 g the same for the age 2 group was 50 60 60 and 80 g for locations 1 to 4 respectively a mean value of weight obtained at the end of the first year simulation of the age 1 group from individual locations provided the choice of age 2 group initial weights we conducted a few sensitivity experiments to identify the importance of various parameters and coefficients in the model to the simulated sl wet weight and its seasonality ito et al 2004 the leading term in the sardine bioenergetics model was consumption and followed by is respiration both the terms are highly dependent on ocean temperature and therefore conducted a sensitivity experiment by using annual mean temperature tave for this we fixed water temperature at an annual mean temperature in all four locations in the bioenergetics model similarly prey densities pl and zl are also fixed to annual mean values as consumption is also dependent on prey density in addition to these experiments also fixed other parameters associated with consumption vij kij ac and bc and respiration ar br and dr to 10 of the control run details of the experiments are summarized in table 2 3 results 3 1 seasonality of ocean temperature and prey density annual variation of monthly temperature over a depth of 100 m representing for the locations kochi goa ratnagiri and mumbai as zone averages are given in fig 5 pronounced seasonal variability is seen in all four locations with a maximum during march may and a minimum during september october months fig 5a b c and d the maximum and minimum seasonal amplitudes are seen at the kochi location 1 in fig 2 and mumbai location 4 in fig 2 regions the annual temperature range varies from 4 3 c from 24 1 c to 28 4 c in kochi to a minimum of 2 c 25 6 c to 27 6 c on the mumbai coast however the annual temperature range is about 3 2 c 25 c to 28 2 c in goa and ratnagiri locations averaged daily prey density pl and zl over a depth from the surface to 100 m 65 m 85 m and 75 m for locations 1 2 3 and 4 respectively for a period from 1st june 2013 to 31st may 2017 with its standard deviation is shown in fig 5 in the kochi coast fig 5e pl biomass was minimal during the period from march to may and then it shows a gradual enhancement at the beginning of the monsoon season it reaches its maximum abundance during the summer monsoon period with a peak in july with a value of 0 8 µmol n l 1 it decreases abruptly in october and reaches its background value by december the pl biomass in the goa coast shows an enhancement from july with a distinct peak in august the biomass decreases from october till december and again increased during the months of january february fig 5f in the ratnagiri and mumbai regions the abundance of pl biomass was found to be more or less uniform throughout the year fig 5g h abundance in these two locations was higher during the period from march to may and lowered from july to october compared to two southern locations locations 1 and 2 in the mumbai region uniform food was found to be available for sl almost throughout the year the abundance of zl biomass in the kochi region was minimum during the months from april to june then it shoots up to a distinct peak 0 085 µmol n l 1 in july and from the end of july it was maintained at an average value of 0 06 µmol n l 1 till april fig 5i the zl production in the goa region also follows a similar pattern with that of the kochi region but with a higher magnitude and multiple peaks during the summer monsoon season these multiple peaks are coherent with the pl biomass peaks in the same location fig 5j the ratnagiri region shows two minor peaks one in april and the other in october fig 5k the abundance of zl was uniform in the mumbai region with an average value of 0 064 µmol n l 1 fig 5l like the pl abundance the zl abundance is also higher in the northern locations locations 3 and 4 during the pre monsoon period it is lesser during the monsoon period compared to southern locations locations 1 and 2 3 2 growth of oil sardine and its seasonal cycle using pl and zl as prey sardine growth simulated by the bioenergetics model is shown in fig 6 lines the figure s shaded region represents the sl observed weight range from each of the stations in the earlier reports the wet weight continuously increases through the larval and juvenile stages in all the regions until december january and afterward it shows stagnancy in growth after that weight decreases and then increases from june to september months of the second year there are notable regional differences in the growth found in the kochi region location no 1 after hatching age 1 weight increases continuously for the first three months and after that a shorter period of stagnancy was noted from september to october after that it again started to gain weight until december january and reaches a maximum weight of 80 g then reduced until may and attained a weight of 60 g this property of short stagnation in growth is not found in the other three locations in the second year the age 1 individuals of location no 1 further gained weight during the june september period and reach a secondary maximum of about 80 g from september to october the weight reduced again to 60 g similar to what is noticed in the juvenile case and after that these individuals gained weight till it reaches the third maximum of about 80 g they are almost stagnant in this weight fig 6a black line the age 2 individuals also followed the same pattern of gain and loss in weight these organisms also attain a maximum weight of 80 g during the june september and december to january periods with a weight loss 60 g between october to november in goa and ratnagiri region locations no 2 and 3 fish weight was continuously increased from june to december and reached a maximum weight of 100 g black lines in fig 6b c fish weight was stagnant from january to february decreases from march to may and reaches 60 g by the end of the first year however again fish gained weight during june december and the cycle was continued the age 2 also followed the same pattern of gaining and weight reduction as shown in fig 6b c red lines for the goa and ratnagiri region in mumbai region location no 4 the simulated weight was higher than the other three southern and central locations continuous increase in weight was noted from june to march and reached a maximum weight of 110 g it started to reduce its weight to around 100 g during the months april to july period and stagnancy was noted afterward fig 6d red line the age 2 individuals also follow the same seasonal cycle by gaining 100 g and reducing 80 g its weight in respective months fig 6d red line the simulated fish weight with and without food factor were in close agreement however a slight reduction in fish weight is observed without food factor fig s1 the monthly mean wet weight of fish in their second year of growth is shown in fig 7 for all the locations the seasonality in the gain and loss of a grown fish s wet weight in the location 1 and 3 were found to be comparable even though the magnitude of the weight loss and gain was different during the monsoon season june to september the mean wet weight was 72 0 12 8 g and 76 8 6 7 g in the location 1 and 3 it reduced to 65 4 5 3 g in location 1 and increased to 82 7 2 8 g in location 3 during the period from october to november further the wet weight increased to 82 4 2 7 g and 90 0 3 2 g from december to february in locations 1 and 3 respectively during the pre monsoon period march to may a reduction was noted in both the locations 66 7 3 8 g and 75 5 2 8 g in the location 1 and 3 respectively in locations 2 and 4 the weight was 56 7 2 9 g goa and 94 6 11 g mumbai in june and continuously increased till january it attained a weight of 103 6 9 g goa and 105 7 38 g mumbai in january and further reduced till may 65 1 3 g and 99 9 1 g for locations 2 and 4 respectively 3 3 field observations based validations a field sample collection was conducted for two years daily in the kochi region location no 1 and we availed this observed data to validate the model simulation fig 8 during july the population mainly consisted of two distinct groups one is juveniles weighing around 20 g and the second group weighs 40 to 80 g which are consistent with model predicted weights fig 6a and 8a during september november the model predicted values suggest an average weight of 30 g for juveniles and 60 g for adults the observations show a clear peak in the juvenile population albeit with a weak secondary peak in the adult population of 60 g from september to november fig 8b however from december to april the model s predicted value has no supporting evidence from the corresponding observations in fig 8c d 3 4 analysis of model sensitivity the individual terms in the bioenergetics model were shown in fig 9 consumption is the most important term and followed by is respiration consumption depends on the weight of the fish and ocean temperature in all the three southern locations consumption fluctuated according to the seasonal variation of temperature in both age groups in the mumbai location for age group 1 consumption increased with the weight of fish and age group 2 displayed uniform consumption throughout the year the temperature did not play an important role in this location as the temperature in this region is within the maximum consumption range 25 5 c to 26 5 c consumption also depends on the seasonality of plankton density in the region similarly respiration depends on the water temperature and activity of the fish other parameters including respiration also show similar seasonal variation to that of consumption the consumption term in the model heavily depends on temperature and prey density therefore temperature mainly determines the seasonality of the sl growth in the model hence we have investigated individual parameters role in the seasonality of sl growth in the model with different sensitivity experiments as detailed in section 2 3 and table 2 the sensitivity analysis results are shown as the difference in wet weight between the sensitivity simulation and reference simulations for one whole year of age 1 and age 2 the temperature was a sensitive parameter in regulating the seasonality in the growth rate of sl in all the locations except for the mumbai region location no 4 for both the age groups albeit throughout the year fig 10 in the average temperature sensitivity experiment an overall weight gain is found for both age groups in all except the mumbai region moreover in this experiment the control experiment s fish weight reduction during the march may period was not registered in the sensitivity experiment fig 11 and label tave this weight gain could be due to temperature on two leading terms such as consumption and respiration in the fish bioenergetics the fitting of average temperature with the maximum consumption temperature range 25 5 to 26 5 c in the fish bioenergetics may lead to sl s weight gain sensitivity analysis with average pl and zl revealed that the phytoplankton biomass is more significant toward gaining weight than the zooplankton as shown in fig 10 it can be further confirmed from sensitivity analysis results with vulnerability and half saturation constants related to pl and zl an increase 10 in these two constants related to pl significantly contributed towards an increase and a decrease 10 of these two constants leads to a reduction in the weight of sl in all four locations however sensitivity is not observed in these two constants related to zl in all the locations the coefficients related to consumption ac and bc and respiration ar and br were also found contributing towards the significant gain or reduction in the weight of sl in all the studied locations fig 10 11 an increase decrease in weight was registered with a higher lower ac value in all the locations and an opposite response was observed with bc value similarly reduction gain in weight was noted with a higher lower ar value and opposite relation was noted with br value fig 11 4 discussion and conclusions we utilized a fish bioenergetics model coupled with an ecosystem model to study the growth and its seasonal cycle of indian oil sardine along the indian west coast the parameters in the japanese sardine bioenergetics were analyzed and applied to the indian oil sardine bioenergetics model the parameters and coefficients specific to oil sardine were selected based on the available observation and field data unlike many fishes the growth of oil sardine is not impaired by the process of maturation and spawning therefore we did not add reproductive loss in the growth equation okunishi et al 2009 the model successfully reproduced the growth in all four locations studied the results revealed the seasonal cycle of growth exhibited by this species with spatial variability the nemuro fish type models are useful in analyzing sl s growth and identifying the related data gaps as this species is difficult to rear in laboratory settings the sl s simulated wet weight was in good agreement with the observed wet weight from the kochi region and reported wet weight from other locations giving us hope that this tool can be used in practical applications however a slightly higher wet weight was simulated on the mumbai coast in the model daily consumption depends on the maximum consumption rate a function of water temperature and the half saturation constants maximum consumption occurs in the temperature range 25 5 to 26 5 c fig 4 and the water temperature in the mumbai region is observed in this range throughout the year the favourable temperature for maximum consumption could be led to increased weight in the mumbai region half saturation constant is another important parameter that determines consumption and thereby weight gain of the individual fish the uniform abundance of plankton biomass throughout the year as shown in fig 5h and l could be lead to the bigger size of the sardines in this region the easy availability of food and minimal energy required to be spent for grazing may lead to an increase in the weight of individual fish the findings of differences in fish weight in different locations correlate with these locations production periods as mentioned in the methodology section seasonality in the plankton density abundance biomass during june to september and minimum during april to may directly contributed towards an increase or decrease in the weight of individual fish in other regions however a weight reduction is not observed in mumbai due to the uniform abundance in plankton density throughout the year it could be also because sl usually does not prefer to spawn in a northern location as the spawning activity is mainly influenced by rain and cooler temperature during the spawning period prasanna kumar et al 2010 abdellaoui et al 2017 rohit et al 2018 usually juveniles and adults migrate northward from the spawning location for the preferred temperature and food northward expansion in the distribution of sl up to gujarat was noted since the late 1980s because of rise in ocean temperature vivekanandan et al 2009 the maximum growth during the early life stage may contribute towards the higher simulated weight in this region simulated fish weight in the kochi region location 1 was in agreement with the data collected from the field sample except for the period from december to april it could be due to the offshore migration of sl during this period during may an adult population of 60 g started appearing in the sampled population as sl re enter coastal water for spawning moreover simulated fish weight from all four locations was found to be comparable with the observed weight of individual fish reported from these locations during field collection of the sample population fish weighing in a range of 8 to 80 g kerala coast 31 to 87 g goa coast 11 to 86 g ratnagiri coast and 11 to 87 g mumbai coast were collected nair et al 2016 deshmukh et al 2016 shah et al 2014 shah et al 2019 as shown in fig 6 shade growth studies along the indian west coast are mainly performed by length frequency analysis by converting length into weight using the length weight relationship the weight of fish in their second year of growth is calculated at about 54 g afterward it increased to 60 g in the calicut region another southern location as reported by antony raja 1970 however individual fish weighed higher than this in northern latitudes as fish weighed more than 70 g in their second year and further increased to 98 g in the mumbai region shah et al 2019 moreover the maximum weight noted from the calicut coast is 100 g and that from the karnataka region is 159 g rohit et al 2018 the feeding intensity of oil sardine was also different in different locations as observed during gut contents analysis of the collected sample population in the karwar coast southern part fish were shown a low feeding intensity during december to january and moderate feeding from february to march and again shifted to low feeding from april to may however in the mumbai location feeding intensity was moderate to high till december shifted to low intensity during january to march and shifted to moderate to high intensity during april to may ahirwal et al 2018 the difference in the feeding intensity could be due to the uniform plankton availability in the mumbai region compared to the southern region as shown in fig 5 this prolonged higher feeding could due to the favorable temperature for maximum consumption and uniform food availability throughout the year in the mumbai region and resulted in the higher weight of the individual fish the simulated growth rate and seasonality were also in agreement with the field observation of oil sardine from the calicut coast in a field study reported by antony raja 1970 it is observed that there is a rapid rate of growth during the first 2 3 months and 70 of the growth of the first year is attained during this period fish attains its maturity during the first year the probable reason attributed to this is the physiological tendency of the most significant growth rate during the early stages of life combined with abundant food supply resources during this period a slackening of growth during the october to november period and fall on a plateau from january to march was observed with the fish s length it may be due to the natural reduction of growth crowding and competition for depleted food crops the paucity of favorable food items and reservation of resources for muscular fat and possibly more congenial environment away in deeper waters along with some connection between simultaneous gonad and body growth in our simulation we also noted a reduction in growth during this period it could be attributed to the reduction in the pl biomass during october to november months and january to march fig 5e afterward pl biomass further decreased and a corresponding reduction in the weight of fish was observed during this period fig 6a black lines in the months of october november zl biomass did not fluctuate albeit the reduction during the period from january to march ocean temperature in the location 1 2 and 3 was also above the range of maximum consumption fig 5a b and c which may lead to a reduction in the growth of fish in these locations during the post january period fig 6a b and c in the model these factors contributed towards weight reduction and during this period the fish may be migrating from these coastal locations to offshore and deeper waters for feeding and optimal temperature results of the control run revealed that the leading terms of the bioenergetics model are consumption and followed is respiration both are highly dependent on water temperature sensitivity experiments affirm the importance of temperature on consumption and respiration seasonal variability in temperature was found to be minimum in the mumbai region fig 5d and this region did not display sensitivity towards the average temperature notably the seasonal amplitude of temperature was minimum at this location compared to all other locations used in this study in the other three locations the observed seasonality in the growth of fish in the control run was not found in the sensitivity run and this can be attributed to the maximum consumption during the temperature range 25 5 to 26 5 c fig 4 and the fitting of average temperature in this range sardine prefers a temperature range of 26 to 28 c and a good fishery is observed within this range an offshore migration of juvenile and adult populations was noted with an increase in the water temperature chidambaram 1950 bensam 1970 prey density is another important parameter that determines consumption results of this sensitivity experiment showed that the pl and associated coefficients are more sensitive in the model compared to the zl and associated coefficients the coefficients associated with consumption and respiration was also found to be critical in sardine bioenergetics with a higher sensitivity towards the consumption coefficients in this study we considered only the growth of individual fish and in the future effort population dynamics and migration for sardine could be added population dynamics models for other species such as saury herring and pacific sardine megrey et al 2007a b rose et al 2008 rose et al 2015 are already in use similar models could be developed for indian ocean pelagics and it could be a useful tool in fisheries management and research sardine population exhibit wide fluctuation in production with a distinct period of abundance and decline along the coast of the arabian sea the multidecadal variability exhibited by this species is closely linked to the environmental parameters hamza et al 2021 nemuro fish type models could be used to analyze the mechanism of changes in sardine growth with the help of multi decadal simulations with realistic environmental forcing understanding the mechanism of variability in the production will be helpful in the policy making for the management of small pelagics in the background of climate change in conclusion we have successfully implemented a sardine bioenergetics model with a lower trophic ecosystem model and simulated the growth and seasonal cycle realistically this model s advantage is the potential to investigate the role of physical forcing factors in primary production zooplankton standing stocks and ltl connection to htl extension to the population dynamics model could be a useful tool to address the impact of climate change on biological productivity and sardine growth it can be further extended to other commercially and ecologically important fish species over the indian coast to address the variability in production and also for policy making 5 author contributions dr faseela hamza involved in conceptualization of the model and prepared the manuscript dr vinu valsala involved

partnership formally created in 1983 to guide and foster restoration of the chesapeake bay and its watershed this partnership includes all six states within the bay watershed virginia maryland pennsylvania west virginia delaware and new york and the district of columbia d c plus hundreds of federal state and local government agencies academic institutions and nonprofit interest groups the cbp partnership formed out of concerns regarding the loss of submerged aquatic vegetation sav and extensive low oxygen hypoxic and anoxic waters in the bay referred to as dead zones documented locally as early as the 1930 s kemp et al 2005 since its inception the cbp partnership has relied on a complex coupled modeling system to predict the watershed loads of total nitrogen phosphorus and sediment that the chesapeake bay can receive while still maintaining acceptable water quality in terms of dissolved oxygen concentrations water clarity and chlorophyll a concentration the 2010 version of this coupled modeling system cerco et al 2010 linker et al 2013a b shenk and linker 2013 specifically estimated the total maximum daily loads tmdls of nitrogen phosphorus and sediment that could be allowed to reach bay waters such that the tidal water quality standards were still met as mandated by the clean water act the 2014 chesapeake bay watershed agreement marked a substantial advancement in the restoration effort for the bay with all seven major watershed jurisdictions signing onto an expanded vision of bay management cbp 2014 the 2014 agreement outlines five themes related to abundant life clean water climate change conserved lands and engaged communities and provides specific goals and measurable outcomes associated with targeted timelines and ecological endpoints to evaluate success within each theme the 2014 agreement also brought an important motivational shift in efforts to restore the chesapeake bay the 2014 agreement and its creative framework of themes goals and outcomes incentivizes the changes necessary to achieve the tmdl levels by clearly identifying and leveraging diverse outcomes of societal benefit and value to stakeholder communities in the watershed however the current cbp modeling system retains its historical focus primarily on the strict regulatory interpretation of the tmdls and associated water quality outcomes modeling outcomes inform the management plans of individual jurisdictions and the overall strategy of the cbp partnership specifically efforts to reduce point and nonpoint pollution sources including regulations designed to restrict pollutant transport into the chesapeake bay and u s coastal waters over the past four decades the cbp modeling system has significantly evolved as understanding of processes operating in the bay and its watershed have advanced and management questions progressed the cbp modeling system released in 2017 has multiple components airshed land use watershed estuarine hydrodynamic and water quality models these sub models determine chesapeake bay tmdls in that they are used to force either directly or indirectly the biogeochemistry model that predicts changes in oxygen concentration water clarity and chlorophyll a concentration that result from changes in nutrient and sediment loads the cbp partnership has also promoted the development of living resource models to advance habitat restoration for targeted estuarine species of concern these include models of submerged aquatic vegetation sav and benthic filter feeders directly linked to the estuarine hydrodynamic and water quality models as well as stand alone ecosystem models that simulate interactions of numerous higher trophic level species e g fish crabs by using various outputs of the coupled modeling system as inputs 1 2 history of the chesapeake bay program modeling system the component models of the cbp modeling system and their coupling have been continually updated in response to emerging science and changing water quality and ecological management priorities since the 1980s linker et al 2002 2013a models have been periodically fixed at milestone states of development and then used to evaluate performance of investments implemented to meet tmdl targets for nitrogen phosphorus and sediment and to assess the sufficiency of strategies to raise dissolved oxygen concentrations in the bay to levels determined necessary to support estuarine ecosystem services it is important to emphasize that the chesapeake bay tmdls are specifically designed to meet water quality standards to support living resources for example the limits on deep water dissolved oxygen concentrations have been established to protect juvenile and adult fish as well as shellfish see table 2 in irby and friedrichs 2019 and tango and batiuk 2013 modeling results have also been used to evaluate water quality standards related to the proliferation of sav as well as necessary thresholds for water clarity and chlorophyll a concentrations usepa 2010 the tmdl targets were first legally formalized by the cbp partnership in 2010 usepa 2010 and they were updated most recently with the 2017 midpoint assessment usepa 2018 using the 2017 version of the cbp modeling system to evaluate the contemporary state of the restoration developments in the cbp modeling system from its inception in 1982 to the 2017 milestone i e 2017 midpoint assessment include substantial increases in spatial and temporal resolution in the component airshed watershed and estuarine models and deeper integration with other modeling activities outside of the component models an example of the deeper integration is the recent incorporation of the spatially referenced regressions on watershed attributes sparrow ator et al 2011 model with the most recent 2017 phase 6 version of the watershed model web based distribution of open source public domain model source codes executable models data results documentation tools to assess the effects of management actions on nutrient and sediment loads to the bay and general support of multiple models irby et al 2016 have contributed to the development of the cbp modeling system all of the sub models are now open source and available for use and further development by the research and management communities either directly through the internet or via request these efforts have increased the transparency and accessibility of the cbp modeling system provided opportunities for intermodel comparisons increased stakeholder engagement and fostered trust in the models and their predictions the general acceptance of the cbp modeling system for informing management decisions involved a deliberate and extensive process of review and engagement appendix c of the 2010 tmdl usepa 2010 lists 433 meetings where the tmdl and or models used in the tmdl were the principal topics of the meeting 2005 2010 and 297 additional meetings where the tmdl and or models were on the agenda 2008 2010 the meetings occurred both within the committee and workgroup structure of the cbp at federal state and nongovernmental partner organizations and through scheduled public forums and webinars generally stakeholder working groups primarily the cbp s water quality goal implementation team and its workgroups determine how the models will be used to assist decision making these groups are also charged with determining appropriate model inputs related to land use agricultural systems and management actions according to the best available data technical working groups primarily the modeling workgroup determine the structure and parameterization of the models and inputs such as atmosphere and ocean forcing functions the cbp s scientific and technical advisory committee stac also plays two key roles in model development stac supports broadly attended workshops that encourage cross fertilization of ideas and result in scientific recommendations to the cbp that drive the development of models the foundation of this paper is one such workshop stac also forms committees that perform independent scientific peer reviews of the models e g easton et al 2017 the overall review process and the roles of different groups within and outside of the cbp are discussed in section 1 of the chesapeake assessment scenario tool cast documentation cbp 2020a the participatory development process has expanded in scope over time with earlier models primarily receiving scientific review and later models increasingly receiving review and input from the stakeholder community the process resulted in a steady evolution of the models so they were up to date but also grounded with empirical information this multi decade process of development and feedback has led to a linked modeling system with sufficient transparency and accrued trust so the results are accepted by a wide range of managers and stakeholders as well as by the scientific community the multi decadal process is ongoing with leadership provided for many years by a small group of people at the cbp including coauthors r batiuk l linker and g shenk this experience with the cbp modeling system provides a template for how complicated models can be developed and directly used to inform large scale management decisions as part of the 2017 midpoint assessment the cbp partnership concluded there were no fatal flaws in the milestone 2017 modeling system i e an absence of flaws substantial enough to invalidate its use for decision making by the cbp partnership the 2017 modeling system provided improvements over previous versions cbp 2020a and incorporated feedback from the scientific community and key stakeholders three key groups reviewed the 2017 cbp modeling system 1 the scientific and technical advisory committee stac composed primarily of scientists that advise the cbp 2 the water quality goal implementation team and its workgroups whose membership includes managers stakeholders non governmental organizations and scientists and 3 technical managers and scientists in the modeling workgroup cbp 2020a section 13 starting in 2019 federal state and local jurisdictions have been applying the 2017 modeling system to aid in the development of the phase iii watershed implementation plans these are plans of local management actions designed for their jurisdictional waters to meet the tmdls that will guide water quality management in the chesapeake bay region until the scheduled bay wide assessment in 2025 the science and modeling based approaches to coproduce knowledge formulate solutions to problems and adaptively guide restoration activities is fundamental to the environmental management approach of the cbp partnership and will continue into the foreseeable future particularly as plans are now being made for a next generation modeling system to incorporate new science and monitoring expand the capability of the models and to assess the challenge of 2035 climate change to achieving chesapeake water quality standards 1 3 management perspectives the cbp modeling system was developed specifically to inform management formulations and testing of the models are therefore driven by regulatory management needs the linked models are regulatory models distinct from parallel computational platforms for exploratory research oriented modeling activities that are also ongoing in the bay region e g xu and hood 2006 xu et al 2011 feng et al 2015 wiggert et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 2016 irby et al 2016 irby and friedrichs 2019 st laurent et al 2020 ator and garcia 2016 ator et al 2019 testa et al 2017 as a tool for management with specific deadlines and milestones the cbp modeling system must also be available and ready to be used for the next set of questions and decisions on a schedule that meets management deadlines examples of major court and management policy mandated deadlines are the assessments for the 2010 tmdl 2017 midpoint assessment and upcoming 2025 assessment environmental managers from watershed jurisdictions use results from the coupled modeling system to guide water quality management decisions within their local subregions a major use of the modeling system is to develop equitable nutrient and sediment loading targets across state and local jurisdictions and inform efficient implementation of best management practices bmps managers use the modeling system to 1 set nutrient and sediment reduction targets 2 configure nutrient and sediment reduction plans to meet the targets and 3 quantify progress towards the implementation of reduction plans and local and bay wide restoration goals the expansion of the restoration goals in the 2014 agreement inspired further consideration of whether and how the coupled modeling system can be used beyond the past focus on prescriptive water quality issues under the 2014 agreement managers need information to assess progress related to living resources in the bay and its watershed and consider the effects of climate change and would benefit from models that can populate a decision support system to analyze trade offs and co benefits and to further encourage stakeholder engagement chesapeake bay restoration accomplishments including development of the linked modeling system are cultivated through collaborations among government and nongovernment researchers primarily academics creating opportunities for engagement among groups of managers and scientists who monitor measure test and model processes relevant to the entire socioecological system comprising the chesapeake bay and its watershed these collaborations open novel opportunities for model based experiments to test hypotheses and validate cbp model findings this is where the regulatory cbp modeling system and research oriented models intersect inform and influence each other model comparisons can reveal consistencies and contradictions between cbp model findings and other models or observations e g irby and friedrichs 2019 st laurent et al 2019 resulting in an enhanced understanding of underlying assumptions and processes that ultimately improve the cbp modeling system the cbp modeling system informs bay policy and funding decisions that involve billions of dollars in public and private environmental investments see for example https www epa gov sites production files 2016 03 documents 2015 06 pdf therefore the cbp modeling system has to be scientifically defensible transparent timely useful to manage current environmental issues and representative of the needs of stakeholders in multiple jurisdictions field research and monitoring data are crucial components used to develop and evaluate models whose outputs are used to guide management efforts targeted research informed by modeling is essential to efficiently advance resource management nichols and williams 2006 these tools must also assist managers to quantify benefits costs uncertainties and risks models that contribute to satisfying these requirements create a consistent documented foundation on which to base legislation regulations and investments 1 4 successes and emerging challenges the cbp modeling system has played a crucial role in recent management successes these include the achievement of the 2025 goals for nitrogen and phosphorus pollutant load reductions collectively from hundreds of chesapeake bay watershed municipal and industrial wastewater treatment facilities a decade early dance 2016 in addition trends in recent years suggest that the summertime anoxic volume i e dead zone is decreasing fig 1 and see ni et al 2020 and sav has shown signs of recovering lefcheck et al 2018 see also cbp 2020c however the cbp modeling system will need to evolve and advance to address new challenges to provide managers with relevant information the most daunting future challenge is ensuring the modeling system can inform management decisions under a changing natural and human environment globally influenced changes in regional weather patterns and sea level rise are affecting temperature watershed dynamics estuarine hydrodynamics biogeochemistry and ecology e g irby et al 2018 lefcheck et al 2017 st laurent et al 2020 testa et al 2018 ni et al 2020 in addition increasing human population in the watershed will continue to influence stressors that will interact with the effects of climate change and sea level rise the human population in the chesapeake bay watershed is projected to increase by about 12 percent from 2010 to 2025 17 3 million to 19 4 million cbp 2020b the 2014 agreement explicitly addresses climate change with goals and outcomes related to climate resiliency monitoring assessment and adaptation these considerations challenge the cbp modeling system to ensure that the modeling results can inform these goals in addition to its recognition of climate change relevance another notable aspect of the 2014 agreement is its identification of goals and targets that go beyond water quality based metrics for example the 2014 agreement highlights consideration of the effects that water quality has on tidal and nontidal living resources which beyond sav and benthic filter feeders have not been a prior focus the modeling system would need to expand its capabilities to other species in order to support multiple objective decision making that could better encompass the associated broader set of goals such as the simultaneous impacts to habitat quality and quantity a variety of aquatic organisms and fisheries harvests in response to restoration relating management induced water quality responses to living resources is a formidable task considering the diverse species and habitats involved and that multiple factors beyond bay water quality and habitat e g ocean conditions and societally driven global and local harvests can also affect most living resources another class of challenges centers on the scale of the predictions from the cbp modeling system high resolution simulations to guide the design implementation and performance evaluation of optimal water quality management practices at local scales are in high demand for example the current watershed model in the cbp modeling system averages many conditions for a given land use within a county potentially obscuring the importance of implementing best management practices where they can best reduce and prevent nutrient and sediment runoff easton et al 2020 local and state governments responsible for implementing management actions related to the tmdls have expressed interest in maximizing co benefits of their investments on nutrient and sediment controls co benefits are ecosystem services that achieve nutrient and sediment reduction objectives while also addressing 2014 agreement outcomes related to flood control open space amenities recreational uses terrestrial species habitat and healthy fisheries some cbp managers need tools that predict localized responses of interest e g nontidal stream health while others need tools suitable for integration across jurisdictions to achieve regional and bay wide goals 2 the cbp modeling system and recommendations for future development this paper summarizes the results of a 2018 workshop designed to identify needed modifications and advancements to the cbp modeling system to address the emerging management questions and challenges spurred by the 2014 agreement and scheduled to be assessed in 2025 the workshop hood et al 2019 involved academic and government scientists and managers active in the cbp partnership who were specifically tasked to review the status of the modeling system as of 2017 reflect upon the history of cbp modeling efforts and offer guidance on future research needs and priorities the development of the cbp modeling system offers lessons learned that are relevant to other large watershed estuarine systems facing similar water quality impairments and management challenges recommendations were developed during workshop breakout sessions that began the afternoon of the first day and continued through the morning of the third and final day of the workshop breakout groups were formed for land change modeling watershed hydrology watershed nitrogen watershed phosphorus watershed sediment estuarine hydrodynamics estuarine biogeochemistry and estuarine living resources breakout groups leaders were charged with delivering a short bulleted list of high priority recommendations to be reported in plenary in the final workshop session leaders sought to develop consensus within the breakout sessions around the priority recommendations during the workshop leaders with the assistance of interested workshop participants wrote related sections of the workshop report hood et al 2019 that emphasized the priority recommendations but also more fully addressed the workshop questions as mentioned above the cbp modeling system fig 2 comprises airshed land use watershed and estuarine models the airshed model predicts changes in atmospheric deposition of inorganic nitrogen and other selected species on the watershed and tidal bay due to changes in emissions the land use model predicts changes in land use sewage and septic systems in response to shifts in population expected housing and commercial property demand and land use policies the watershed model combines the output of these models with other data sources such as implemented bmps and the us census of agriculture to predict the point source and non point source distributed loads of nitrogen phosphorus and sediment entering the bay for the nine major tributary rivers and along shorelines of the bay and its many estuarine tributaries the estuarine hydrodynamic and biogeochemistry models predict variations in bay circulation and water quality due to changes in input loads provided by the watershed model changes in atmospheric forcing and regional effects of climate change i e sea level rise and changes in precipitation and temperature in addition the biogeochemistry model can simulate the impacts of changes in water quality on sav and benthic filter feeders finally there are currently two living resource models developed by the noaa chesapeake bay office ncbo that are not part of the cbp modeling system but can use output from the estuarine hydrodynamic and biogeochemistry models to assess how changes in water quality due to management actions might impact higher trophic levels the components of the cbp modeling system including the ncbo living resource models are all loosely coupled in that data are transferred manually from one sub model to another i e the output data of one model are transferred to a downstream model this loose coupling has the advantage of facilitating work flow because the cbp sub models are often used for separate tasks and at separate times for example the estuarine biogeochemistry model determines the allowable nutrient and sediment loads that will meet water quality standards and is run infrequently for goal setting the watershed model typically has thousands of scenarios run each year on how to achieve the allowable loads the airshed model provides a limited range of national emission reduction scenarios from the clean air act that can be considered by cbp decision makers loose coupling also improves scenario analysis efficiency that is it is easier to work on a single model for the numerous sensitivity runs and tests that are required for each launch application of the cbp models note however that some of the cbp sub models are fully coupled i e where the feedback loops are too critical to do otherwise for example the sav and benthic filter feeder models mentioned above and described in section 2 4 1 are directly coupled to the estuarine biogeochemistry model so that they can provide continuous dynamic feedback to one another 2 1 airshed model 2 1 1 overview of the 2017 airshed model the airshed model in the coupled system is the open source community multiscale air quality cmaq fig 3 foley et al 2010 cmaq itself consists of a series of coupled models meteorological emission and photochemical air quality that work in concert to estimate the emissions and fates of atmospheric gaseous and particulate pollutants acid nutrient or toxic and their precursors foley et al 2010 cmaq predicts the fate of these pollutants as they transport through the airshed and deposit back to earth s surface or react to form secondary pollutants cmaq is maintained by the u s environmental protection agency epa center for environmental measurements and modeling and since its initial release in 1998 cmaq has been widely used to evaluate potential national regional and state specific air quality policy management decisions cmaq can be used to explore different meteorological and atmospheric pollutant emission scenarios campbell et al 2019 for example cmaq is often used to test the impact of future emission regulations on deposition and determine which individual emission sources are the largest contributors to air pollution at a site zhang et al 2012 cmaq s generalized and flexible formulation has enabled incorporation of alternate process algorithms and numerical solutions to include new science in the model to address increasingly complex air pollution issues cmaq requires two primary types of inputs meteorological information and emission rates from sources that affect air quality the cmaq version 5 0 2 model used with the 2017 cbp modeling system has a 3 dimensional domain that covers the north american continent at a 12 12 km grid scale fig 4 that includes the chesapeake bay watershed and bay tidal waters the model uses year specific meteorological inputs from the weather research and forecasting wrf skamarock and klemp 2008 model and combines hourly emissions data from the u s epa s national emissions inventory with the open source sparse matrix operator kernel emissions smoke model to estimate the magnitude and location of pollution sources cmaq then calculates atmospheric transport transformation and deposition of a suite of anthropogenic pollutants including ozone particulate matter toxics acid deposition and several forms of oxidized e g nox and reduced e g nh3 nitrogen the 2002 to 2012 cmaq simulations used the bidirectional nh3 exchange option where the surface ammonia flux is modeled as a gradient based process that can result in emissions from land use with enriched ammonium concentrations in the soil or vegetation e g agriculture or deposition to land to better capture the observed variability in nh3 dry deposition bash et al 2013 cmaq is continuously evaluated against network satellite and field sampled atmospheric chemistry and air quality observations cmaq effectively describes seasonal variability and trends 2002 2012 in oxidized and reduced nitrogen wet deposition and in ambient oxidized nitrogen concentrations over its broad domain which gives confidence that wet and dry deposition of nitrogen to the chesapeake bay watershed are also simulated well bash et al 2013 qiang zhang et al 2019a 2 1 2 airshed model advantages and limitations the cmaq model is based on first principles and is not calibrated to specific monitoring stations however cmaq is routinely evaluated against network observations to assess its performance in capturing the magnitude and trends in ambient concentrations and wet deposition at monitoring sites appel et al 2021 zhang et al 2019a kelly et al 2019 starting with cmaq v5 3 there is an option for land use specific dry deposition appel et al 2021 this option allows better integration of flux estimates from the model grid cells with a grid spacing on the order of 10s of km with critical loads assessments and dry deposition impacts on water quality where finer scale details are necessary due to differences in the retention and sensitivity of different land uses to pollutant nitrogen deposition in the chesapeake bay watershed however where dry deposition accounts for approximately half of the atmospheric nitrogen loading modeling of this deposition cannot be sufficiently evaluated due to the lack of a routine dry deposition monitoring network to mitigate this uncertainty model algorithms were developed from field scale observations e g bash et al 2013 but this results in uncertainty for land use types where these detailed measurements are absent additionally ambient atmospheric measurements of nitric acid and ammonia primary components of nitrogen dry deposition are uncommon making even a qualitative evaluation difficult wang et al 2021 improvements in satellite air quality measurements specifically nh3 wang et al 2021 are filling in many of these measurement gaps but do not yet have a sufficient history of observations to assess trends in ambient concentrations 2 1 3 airshed model summary recommendations in the short term research should focus on the influence of climate change on the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen as wet dry and organic nitrogen deposition the cmaq model should include the full characterization of organic nitrogen deposition including pollen and other particulate forms to better constrain mass balances of nitrogen deposition to surface waters in watersheds and coastal systems organic nitrogen deposition can be an important atmospheric nitrogen source in many areas and is currently underestimated by cmaq 5 0 2 and earlier versions in most areas a second area of short term focus is better quantification of the biases in predicted oxidized nitrogen concentrations in cmaq to improve the accuracy of model predictions for the chesapeake bay watershed portion of the grid land use specific deposition estimates should be adopted that have been validated against field measurements the process of validating the deposition estimates will help guide efforts to reduce parameter uncertainty and provide loading estimates that are more relevant to watershed transport processes and mitigation e g riparian buffers in the long term cmaq should be run at a higher spatial resolution with a nonuniform horizontal grid and apply methods to enable more complete quantification of the effects of parameter uncertainty on model predictions a more resolved model grid could improve prediction for the chesapeake bay subregion because the current 12 12 km resolution fails to fully resolve the observed spatial variability in atmospheric deposition especially with deposition related to sea breezes along major transportation corridors and for other processes dependent on local scales an unstructured grid would allow for higher resolution where it is needed while also keeping computational demands reasonable output from cmaq is used as inputs to other models and sensitivity analyses would provide the basis for propagating uncertainty through the coupled modeling system other long term priorities are developing the ability to make more direct connections to the watershed model and estuarine hydrodynamic and biogeochemistry models and evaluation of parameterization throughout the entire model domain more direct connections to other cbp models that receive deposition predictions e g providing cmaq with specific information about land use from the watershed model and or specific information about temperature and heat exchange from the hydrodynamic model would enable the model to better capture feedbacks 2 2 land use change model 2 2 1 overview of the 2017 land use change model the u s geological survey began developing the chesapeake bay land change model cblcm in 2012 fig 5 to inform how land use planning and land conservation decisions would impact water quality and wildlife habitats the cblcm was developed in response to two stac sponsored independent scientific peer reviews of earlier modeling efforts at forecasting land change effects the reviews emphasized among other issues the need to simulate multiple future scenarios and to explicitly quantify and communicate model uncertainties pyke et al 2008 and pyke et al 2010 results from the cblcm are used to inform the locality specific phase iii watershed implementation plans developed by maryland pennsylvania west virginia and several counties in virginia wip 2019a b c d the cblcm is a pseudo cellular automata urban growth model that stochastically simulates the future footprint of residential and commercial development associated with growth in population and employment fig 6 see also output posted on the phase 6 viewer at https chesapeake usgs gov phase6 map the 2017 version of the model incorporates data from 2013 onward to forecast annual development to 2025 at a 30 meter cell resolution and associated conversions of forest and farmland and changes in the populations served by sewer or septic systems the model s forecasts are based on 1 state sanctioned projections of population and employment 2 population and housing data and trends reported by u s census bureau 3 land cover trends derived from the national land cover database homer et al 2015 4 mapped protected lands and sewer service areas and 5 county level zoning data for the baseline scenario the cblcm simulates residential and commercial growth within individual counties by first assessing the amount of future county level housing and employment that will occur as infill or redevelopment within census urbanized areas remaining future housing and employment represent demands for greenfield residential and commercial development respectively greenfield residential development is simulated by stochastically allocating seed cells of residential growth onto a residential probability surface the residential probability surface is derived through logistic regression comparing randomly sampled observations of growth within residential areas e g change in national land cover database developed area classes 21 24 within census block groups with a housing to jobs ratio greater than one with randomly sampled explanatory variables estimated for all areas suitable for growth i e unprotected gently sloped and undeveloped lands a residential seed will sprout and grow into a patch of residential development if the value of the probability surface at the seed cell location exceeds a random value assigned to the seed the patch growth routine is the pseudo cellular automata part of the model seed cells grow over a resistance surface weighted by proximity to the seed and proximity to the nearest road residential patch size potentials for each seed are randomly selected from the observed patch size distribution of residential development occurring between 2001 and 2011 as a patch is grown households are accumulated within the patch from an underlying housing density surface patches stop growing when either the maximum patch size is reached the county level demand for housing is met or localized obstructions to growth e g roads steep slopes open water protected lands prevent the patch from achieving its assigned size this entire process is repeated for greenfield commercial growth using the greenfield demand for jobs and raster surfaces representing employment probability job density and commercial areas for any given future scenario the cblcm simulates 101 independent monte carlo iterations the results of which are then averaged by watershed model land river segment described in section 2 3 these stochastic iterations enable the assessment of model uncertainty associated with the growth allocation process for every land river segment the relative standard deviation of future development is calculated to model uncertainty in addition the results of the logistic regressions are saved for every scenario and can be inspected to understand the explanatory power of the residential and commercial probability surfaces in addition to the baseline current zoning scenario the cblcm is capable of simulating alternative future scenarios of residential and commercial development through adjustments to the county level population and employment projections proportion of infill to greenfield development and proportion of urban to rural development areas suitable for development housing and employment densities and the extent of sewer service areas can also be adjusted uniquely for any given scenario e g fig 7 to support development of the phase iii watershed implementation plans 13 alternative future scenarios representing 2025 land use conditions were created by the cbp partnership and run through the cblcm and watershed model these scenarios include historic trends current zoning forest conservation agricultural conservation growth management and eight custom jurisdictional scenarios known as land policy bmps for the jurisdictions of d c delaware maryland 3 scenarios pennsylvania virginia and west virginia descriptions of these scenarios can be found in the scenario section of the user documentation for the chesapeake assessment scenario tool cbp 2020b the cblcm is designed to simulate plausible long term average levels of residential and commercial land use change unlike land cover change which can be consistently observed by satellites over time land use change is challenging to validate because few areas have been consistently mapped for land use over multiple time periods fortunately maryland maintains statewide tax parcel data attributed to land use and year built fields which can be used to validate county level rates of residential and commercial land consumption simulated by the cblcm rates were estimated as acres of consumption per year per housing unit and per job modeled residential land consumption rates were compared from 2013 to 2025 against observed residential rates for 2001 2011 and 2011 2019 for most counties the cblcm simulated plausible but higher residential land consumption rates compared to observations over the more recent 2011 2019 period and lower residential land consumption rates compared to observations over the earlier period 2001 2011 the nationwide housing boom occurred during the former period as did high levels of suburban sprawl development in contrast during the latter period the nation was recovering from an economic recession for commercial growth the cblcm simulated plausible but higher rates of land consumption over the single observation period 2006 2016 this is largely due to an under estimation of job densities jobs acre particularly in rural counties 2 2 2 land use change model advantages and limitations for input to watershed and water quality models accurately simulating land use is more important than accurately simulating land cover because it is more relevant to nutrient and sediment loading rates for example the land uses of turf grass and cropland have the same cover type herbaceous yet very different nutrient inputs and yields as another example a land use model will simulate the entire footprint of large lot residential development and not just the impervious portions as a regional land use model some specific advantages of the cblcm are that it simulates urban infill redevelopment residential and commercial greenfield development and distinguishes between growth on sewer versus septic systems the cblcm can also simulate multiple stochastic iterations of growth per scenario enabling the quantification of spatial uncertainty moreover the cblcm estimates residential and commercial densities which are necessary for deriving impervious cover from land use and are essential for land use planning the central limitation of the cblcm is that it is challenging to validate because no states except maryland have data for consistently mapping land use over multiple time periods accurately simulating urban land use change requires estimation and prediction of the demand for land density of development and the portion of growth attributable to infill and redevelopment the cblcm attempts to estimate and predict all three of these components but validation to date has been very limited 2 2 3 land use change model summary recommendations areas of focus for improving cblcm in the long term include further specification of possible futures and improved code design the functionality and transparency of cblcm could be improved by leveraging results from regional transportation models e g motor vehicle emission simulator moves koupal et al 2013 kall et al 2014 liu 2015 and household microsimulation models e g simple integrated land use orchestrator silo moeckel 2017 and enhanced representation of population cohorts i e by age and income and employment sectors e g services administrative financial warehousing in addition efforts should be undertaken to incorporate temporally dynamic feedbacks between development capacity density growth probability and spillover as well as spatial allocation of infill development and redevelopment within urban areas with limits based on wastewater treatment capacity the high resolution land use data for the chesapeake bay watershed could be used to exclude already developed lands from future greenfield development more effectively the cblcm should also be modified to allow simulation of future 1 changes in cropping systems pasture and farm animals 2 changes in forests including changes in composition phenology seral stage and disturbance and 3 conditions consistent with a range of representative concentration pathways rcps and sea level rise scenarios and their associated population and employment projections finally a modular design should be adopted using open source code and leveraging cloud computing and storage resources 2 3 watershed model 2 3 1 overview of the 2017 phase 6 watershed model the watershed model estimates freshwater sediment nitrogen and phosphorus loads to the chesapeake bay from multiple sources in the watershed and determines how different management actions would affect these loadings there are two versions of the 2017 model which are constrained to produce identical output over the long term 1 a time averaged average annual loads version widely used by the cbp partnership for scenario assessments and watershed implementation plan development and 2 a dynamic version used in calibration and to drive the estuarine models for full documentation of both versions and the relationship between them see cbp 2020a 2 3 1 1 time averaged watershed model the cbp uses the time averaged version of the 2017 watershed model in the chesapeake tmdl to set planning targets design implementation plans and track the progress in implementation of nutrient reduction efforts relative to their goals chesapeake assessment scenario tool cast cbp 2020a cast provides estimates of average annual loads that would be expected given ten years of typical weather conditions typical weather conditions were defined by the cbp during the tmdl process as the period 1991 2000 importantly this model is intended to calculate the nitrogen phosphorus and sediment load annually delivered to the tidal bay from each land use within each segment given a set of management options scenarios of management options may include land use estimates from the cblcm atmospheric deposition from cmaq specification of point source and septic system discharges and implementation of urban best management practices and agricultural conservation practices collectively referred to as bmps the structure of the time averaged 2017 watershed model for nitrogen and phosphorus load predictions is organized by nine primary components fig 8 the approach for estimating nutrient loads involves several sequential computations the top line in fig 8 average loads δ inputs and sensitivities represents the calculation of water quality loads exported from a land use to a stream in a watershed segment taking into account local applications of nutrients but not local watershed conditions e g watershed location geology the average load represents the chesapeake bay watershed wide average annual load per acre for a given land use type δ inputs represents the local deviation from the chesapeake bay watershed wide mean input rate in pounds per acre for inputs such as fertilizer manure and atmospheric deposition sensitivity is the change in load to a stream from a unit change in an input sensitivity factors are specific to land use and input types after nutrient loads to a stream are derived from the initial step described above the loads are then multiplied by the acres of the land use in the watershed segment land use acres and modified by the effect of implemented local bmps land to water factors are then applied to account for spatial differences in loads due to physical watershed characteristics land to water factors do not add to or subtract from the loads over the entire chesapeake bay watershed instead they represent the spatial variability of nutrient delivery the application of the four components results in an estimate of nutrient loads delivered to a stream or water body in a land river segment after nutrient loads delivered to a stream are estimated in the previous step stream delivery factors are then applied to account for processes influencing nutrient concentrations in stream flows with a mean annual discharge less than 100 cubic feet per second conceptually these are attenuation factors that act to decrease nutrient delivery in small streams as the loads move downstream to the boundary of the larger river reaches river delivery factors account for nutrient attenuation processes in the larger rivers finally direct loads are nutrient loads that do not come from the land surface or subsurface and include point sources stream bank erosion and direct deposition of livestock manure in streams fig 9 shows the major nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to the time averaged model from 1985 to 2019 and fig 10 shows annual mean total nitrogen and phosphorus loads in the chesapeake bay watershed for the year 2017 simulated by the time averaged model each component in fig 8 is represented by simple coefficients however the technical methods of deriving the coefficients through a collaborative process can be quite complex the cbp partnership has used multiple models and multiple lines of evidence from scientific observations wherever possible to estimate the coefficients for example average loads are calculated using the average of several fully calibrated models table 1 other coefficients are borrowed directly from companion models land to water and stream to river factors are taken directly from usgs sparrow simulations of the chesapeake bay watershed ator et al 2011 while land use acres are from the cblcm and atmospheric deposition is from cmaq bmp reduction factors are estimated by a collaborative expert literature review process e g berg et al 2013 river to bay factors are calculated from the calibrated dynamic model full description of the sources of information and the cbp partnership decisions are available cbp 2020a the time averaged structure for sediment load prediction is similar to the nine components described above for nutrients but with some important differences in source and delivery estimation the top line of fig 8 rather than representing edge of stream nutrients now pertains to field mobilized sediments these sediment loads are estimated using a spatial application of rusle revised universal soil loss equation predictions usda 2013 land to water factors are now conceptualized as delivery ratios for mobilized sediment and are implemented based on observations of yield reductions across a range of increasing watershed drainage area sizes cavalli et al 2013 roehl 1962 direct load sources are similar to those for nutrients with stream erosion playing a greater role net average annual reductions in sediment loads within streams are assumed to be low relative to other terms in the model based on sparrow results brakebill et al 2010 and sediment budgets noe et al 2020 therefore stream to river factors are set such that they counteract erosion sources reductions to sediment loads due to reservoir sedimentation are estimated using approaches designed for the sparrow model load estimation approach brakebill et al 2010 2 3 1 2 dynamic watershed model the cbp partnership also maintains a dynamic version of the watershed model to provide daily loads to the estuarine water quality model and to estimate some parameters such as river delivery factors and stormwater runoff for use in the time averaged model the relationship between the time averaged and the dynamic models is depicted in fig 11 the dynamic model uses hydrological simulation program fortran hspf see borah and bera 2004 to simulate hydrology sediment transport and nutrient transport in streams hspf simulates time dependent hydrologic and water quality processes on land surfaces in the subsurface in streams and within well mixed impoundments nutrient export from the land surface and subsurface is temporally downscaled from the long term predictions of the time averaged model using an algorithm dependent on nutrient application timing and hspf simulations of hydrology and sediment the structure is documented in cbp 2020a section 10 the simulations run for the chesapeake bay implementation are forced with hourly values of rainfall snowfall temperature evapotranspiration wind solar radiation dewpoint and cloud cover input data include land use acreage from the cblcm and atmospheric deposition from cmaq as well as bmps fertilizer and manure applications and point source and septic loads to calculate daily flow and associated nutrient and sediment loads 2 3 2 time averaged and dynamic watershed model advantages and limitations the adaptable multi model structure of the watershed model allows the ongoing leveraging of other models and analyses of monitoring data for its improvement the flexible construction is conducive to effective adaptive management which guides better decision making thereby improving environmental results easton et al 2017 the reduced complexity of cast the time averaged version is more understandable to the stakeholder community and has allowed for greater participation in model development moreover the relatively fast run times and web interface for cast allow users to generate their own scenarios or custom reports of previously run scenarios additionally because the cast structure is compiled from multiple sources its use facilitates an uncertainty quantification finally because of the simplified cast structure it is able to take advantage of spatially and temporally dense data sets for water quality measurements and daily load calculations at critical points in the watershed including near the head of tide for major bay tributaries but opportunities for improvement in simulation capacity remain the details of calculation for individual model components can be quite complex and not all of the parameters can be estimated using companion modeling approaches as a result no comprehensive assessment of load prediction uncertainty has been completed particularly with respect to model quantification of load alterations due to anthropogenic changes over time easton et al 2017 demand has increased for better targeting of management practices to improve the effectiveness and lower costs of restoration and with this a need to develop better estimates of nutrient and sediment transport potential at a fine scale easton et al 2020 a related issue is the need to improve targeting of practices that reduce those species of nutrients and sources of sediment with greater efficacy towards water quality load reductions shenk et al 2020 craig et al 2008 filoso et al 2015 model upgrades will be needed to appropriately assess the effect of landscape land use and land management on fine scale delivery and speciation this is particularly true of the sediment simulation approach that requires support from measurements from small headwater streams to large rivers and delivery functions customized to varied landscape settings easton et al 2017 smith et al 2011 noe et al 2020 2 3 3 watershed model summary recommendations 2 3 3 1 general recommendations development of the watershed model components of the cbp modeling system should focus on accurately predicting delivery of nutrients and sediment consistently across spatial scales and properly account for lag times in movement from watershed sources to the bay special attention to scaling issues is necessary to identify water quality problems and management solutions at a site or stream segment scale as well as cumulative impacts on the scale of a river and watershed the watershed models should strive to adopt agile modular designs to facilitate investigation of varied processes and alternative algorithms and to increase transparency for scientists working on diverse aspects of watershed hydrology as well as sediment nitrogen and phosphorus transport and transformation this should include formalisation of rules and procedures for linking modules across spatial and temporal scales modularization will provide greater flexibility and facilitate examination and testing of alternative approaches for quantification and simulation of biophysical processes at lower and higher resolutions and with different levels of mechanistic detail leavesley et al 2002 additionally modular design will facilitate functional expansion of the models to simulate future issues such as the transport and fate of contaminants of emerging concern all data code output and documentation should be made openly available online to enable a community modeling approach to future model development 2 3 3 2 watershed hydrology recommendations improved simulations of chesapeake bay hydrology within the dynamic watershed model would improve predictions of the effects of management actions on nutrient and sediment delivery one area in need of improvement is representation of the hydrologic processes at sub basin scales to better depict the spatial distribution of nutrient and sediment source problems and to generate more finely resolved predictions of pollutant transport within the bay watershed such information would identify areas that if managed sustainably would be most effective to help achieve management and restoration goals veith et al 2003 2004 easton et al 2008 2017 tomer 2018 another area for improvement is the development of a version of the model based on a standard watershed layer appropriate for the scale that management actions are implemented such as the national hydrography dataset nhd or hydrologic unit code huc closer matching between model and management spatial scales would allow for easier conversion and communication of model results to managers over the long term a complementary approach to the basin wide management scale model would be to perform high resolution sub basin scale dynamic simulations in a few select locations that can be used to inform the larger scale management model models operating at scales commensurate with processes occurring on hillslopes and in small headwater streams and capable of resolving fine scale locations of bmp implementation would more accurately quantify headwater inputs into higher order rivers and estuarine tributaries these smaller scale watershed models and the related data assembly can be developed based on regular or irregular mesh grids or can use hydrologic response unit hru based hillslope physiographic district or tributary scale resolution reger and cleaves 2008 cleaves 2003 smith et al 2011 smith and wilcock 2015 amin et al 2017 2018 liu et al 2017 veith et al 2019 williams et al 2015 collick et al 2015 in particular recent developments in watershed reactive transport modeling have advanced forward to couple watershed hydrological processes and land surface interactions with multi component reactions to capture the dynamics of water and biogeochemical interactions including nutrients carbon and sediment transport bao et al 2017 li 2019 zhi et al 2019 a candidate dynamic watershed model that could address many of these limitations and recommendations is the bio reactive transport and flux version of the penn state integrated hydrologic modeling system biort flux pihm zhi and li 2020 in biort flux pihm water flow is dictated by watershed hydrology that is influenced by meteorological conditions and other watershed characteristics domain discretization is fundamental to the approach and an unstructured triangular irregular network e g delaunay triangles is generated with geometric and parametric constraints bhatt et al 2014 fig 12 shows an example of the domain decomposition of mahantango creek watershed into 2606 triangular mesh elements and 509 linear stream elements biort flux pihm couples flow and transport calculations within a full biogeochemical thermodynamic and kinetic framework steefel et al 2015 thereby enabling explicit tracing of spatial and temporal evolution of geochemical species in fluid and solid phases in particular this code has been applied to understanding fine scale nutrient and carbon transformation and transport processes wen et al 2020 zhi and li 2020 these modeling efforts coupled with insights from data have propelled the shallow and deep hypothesis which underscores the essential role of nutrient concentration contrast in shallow soil water and deeper groundwater in shaping stream and river concentration and discharge relationships and therefore loads at different flow regimes zhi and li 2020 these insights combined with river chemistry data can be used to predict nutrient loads with simplified model structure with reduced computational cost and to estimate nutrient removal in groundwater aquifers the use of these reactive transport models however are not limited to nutrients and carbon they can also be used to simulate other water quality parameters including cations salinity and sediments 2 3 3 3 watershed sediment recommendations translating edge of field to edge of stream is difficult due to high variability across the spatial scales watershed location sub regional setting and localized land use resulting in potentially high uncertainty in estimation smith and wilcock 2015 in addition the balance of deposition and erosion in stream reaches is highly variable but critical to sediment budgets noe et al 2020 these issues can be addressed with the creation of new empirical functions through documentation of sediment transport processes and rates for varied sediment grain size classes throughout watershed stream channel networks in varied land use settings better documentation is particularly important in the low order headwater streams that traverse the steepest elevation gradients penetrate the farthest into upland areas and comprise over half of the total channel network length in the bay watershed time lags in sediment movement to the bay highlight the importance of making sure that stakeholders understand that there can be temporal gaps between sediment source management investments and bay water quality outcomes pizzuto 2014 in the short term an updated cbp watershed model could better represent how runoff drainage networks affect sediment sources sinks transport and fate the addition of residence times of sediment located in temporary storage zones would improve predictions of sediment responses to management actions an updated model for watershed sediment simulations would also carry over to improved simulation of constituents e g nutrients associated with sediments and the use of sediment results as input to habitat quality and effects on living resources e g sav oysters local and regional dynamics of erosion followed by the transport deposition remobilization and eventual delivery to the bay are often very important to local communities and stakeholders the spatiotemporal scales of existing empirical and rules based models do not match process based sediment models dietrich et al 2003 in the longer term the formulations related to sediment transport within the watershed model should be refined to better represent the time scales of sediment delivery and thus allow for better assessment of management practices for both the sediments and associated nutrients pizzuto 2014 filoso et al 2015 williams et al 2017 new science and data are needed to fill gaps in our current knowledge of watershed sediment erosion and delivery rates in prominent physiographic settings and under different land use conditions smith and wilcock 2015 noe et al 2020 a cbp sponsored 2017 legacy sediments workshop identified knowledge gaps and how they could be addressed miller et al 2019a to build on this effort the cbp partnership would benefit from the establishment of a sediment modeling workgroup with expertise in geomorphology and with stakeholder representation to engage in both long term and short term knowledge co generation and strategies to improve the representation of sediment dynamics in the cbp watershed model smith et al 2011 it is anticipated that it could take a decade or more for full development including new data collection and implementation i e calibration validation of a revised sediment transport formulation in the watershed model 2 3 3 4 watershed nutrient recommendations the time averaged version of the nutrient watershed model should be enhanced to become more spatially explicit and mass conserving an enhanced version of the time averaged model could be fit to the fluxes estimated from monitoring data as it is done with the sparrow model e g ator and garcia 2016 and be informed by ensemble predictions of the model component coefficients in a similar manner to the 2017 time averaged model this new version would allow for investigation of the watershed effects of bmp performance including localized effects and interactions with the effects of climate change craig et al 2008 filoso and palmer 2011 a spatially explicit version would also allow for better quantification of nutrient sources and sinks that depend on the spatial arrangement of riparian and wetland areas weller and baker 2014 and improved representation of hydrologic connectivity to identify critical source areas that contribute disproportionately to loads that could then be targeted by management wallace et al 2018 finally this new version would offer the opportunity to quantify nutrient legacy effects revisit riverine biogeochemical processes especially in active channels and floodplains and to incorporate new sources of high resolution data on land use and geomorphology to better represent variability in nutrient retention in forest types and forest seral stages over time and under elevated atmospheric co2 craine et al 2018 for both the time averaged and dynamic watershed models the nutrient forms and species simulated should be evaluated to ensure they can be easily matched to the forms in the estuarine biogeochemical model for example partitioning nutrients into particulate and dissolved phases in the watershed models would improve connectivity with the estuarine model e g dari et al 2018 reactivity might also be considered since effective targeting of management will require implementing practices that reduce the reactive constituents e g liu et al 2018 miller et al 2019b lags related to nitrogen delivery require expanded considerations of groundwater flow pathways and new approaches to quantify travel times and removal rates within drainage networks sanford and pope 2013 phillips and lindsey 2003 specification of delivery processes under varied settings and conditions will be necessary requiring expanded forms of measurement in each of the prominent physiographic settings in the chesapeake bay watershed for example an approach that relates nutrient delivery potential to a measurement such as a topographic wetness index or connectivity index could take advantage of recent increases in land use and elevation measurement scales temporally and spatially dense sensor arrays in low order streams would allow for development and validation of such approaches easton et al 2020 addition of organic carbon to the watershed models is also warranted both to force estuarine biogeochemical models and allow more accurate representation of watershed loads of oxygen demanding material in the present versions of the watershed models carbon loads are derived from the simulated nutrient and sediment loads implementing these recommendations will improve the watershed models ability to identify critical source areas especially those in hydrologically active and connected zones and allow for smooth coupling to other models implementing these recommendations will require re analyses of existing data and collection of additional data e g ator et al 2020 specifically nitrogen speciation sources and sinks will need to be characterized particularly in low order streams leveraging existing data will involve extensive data gathering and the development of new data analysis strategies for using relatively short time series to determine spatial and temporal variability new data in previously unmonitored areas small streams and directly discharging groundwater should be collected to fill important gaps field scale nutrient flux data should be collected relative to field conditions and landscape position to better identify and manage critical source areas buda et al 2009 buda 2013 2013 2 4 estuarine hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry models 2 4 1 overview of the 2017 estuarine hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry models the estuarine model is composed of two independent models a hydrodynamic model computes transport information which is stored offline for repeated use by a biogeochemical model the biogeochemical model is the decision model for projected attainment of tidal bay dissolved oxygen chlorophyll and water clarity standards under tmdl scenarios 2 4 1 1 estuarine hydrodynamic model the estuarine hydrodynamic model curvilinear hydrodynamics in 3 dimensions or ch3d is based on a model originally developed by sheng 1986 that was modified extensively for application to the chesapeake bay johnson et al 1991 kim 2013 the hydrodynamic model is forced by tides wind freshwater inflow and heat exchange at the water surface tides are based on observations recorded near the mouth of the bay noaa tides and currents https tidesandcurrents noaa gov wind and heat exchange are obtained from local meteorological observations noaa national center for environmental information https www ncdc noaa gov cdo web datasets ghcnd locations city us240002 detail salinity and temperature fields are prescribed on the open boundary outside the bay mouth based on observations chesapeake bay program water quality database https www chesapeakebay net what downloads cbp water quality database 1984 present daily freshwater inflow from rivers diffuse coastal plain surface flows and groundwater flows are all prescribed using output from the dynamic 2017 watershed model the ch3d model then calculates time dependent variations in salinity temperature water level elevation velocity and turbulent diffusivity in three dimensions with a 90 second time step there are up to 19 layers in the vertical dimension with a uniform layer thickness of 1 52 m except that the top layer thickness fluctuates with sea level the surface layer is 2 14 m thick at mean tide horizontally the governing equations in the cartesian coordinate system are recast in a boundary fitted curvilinear coordinate system to cope with the irregular shoreline configuration and deep channel orientation in the present chesapeake bay configuration there are 11 064 surface cells and 56 920 total cells with an average grid cell dimension of 1025 1025 m fig 13 2 4 1 2 estuarine biogeochemical model the velocity and diffusivity outputs from the ch3d hydrodynamic model along with nutrient and sediment loads prescribed by the dynamic 2017 watershed model are used to force a finite volume biogeochemical model corps of engineers integrated compartment water quality model abbreviated as ce qual icm or simply icm cerco and cole 1993 cerco and noel 2013 the icm model uses the same grid as ch3d and is forced with hourly transport from ch3d daily loads from the watershed model and monthly boundary concentrations of all state variables at the mouth of the bay the time step is determined dynamically based on computational stability requirements and is 15 min on average icm incorporates 24 state variables that include physical variables salinity temperature fixed solids three groups of phytoplankton dissolved oxygen and multiple forms of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus fig 14 salinity is computed by solving the three dimensional mass conservation equation for a conservative substance computation of temperature however includes atmospheric heat exchange at the water surface evaluated following edinger et al 1974 salinity and temperature are computed in the biogeochemical model to provide quality assurance of the linkage to the hydrodynamic model when forced by the same boundary conditions and surface heat flux salinity and temperature computed in the biogeochemical model should be identical to the hydrodynamic model dortch et al 1992 organic carbon undergoes numerous transformations in the water column the model carbon cycle fig 14 is defined in this context around the process of eutrophication nixon 1995 and consists of the following elements phytoplankton production and excretion predation on phytoplankton dissolution of particulate carbon heterotrophic respiration and settling cerco 2000 algal production is the primary autochthonous organic carbon source to the water column cerco and noel 2004 although carbon also enters the system through external loading brookfield et al 2021 predation on algae releases particulate and dissolved organic carbon to the water column a fraction of the particulate organic carbon undergoes first order dissolution to dissolved organic carbon dissolved organic carbon produced by excretion predation and dissolution is respired at a first order rate to inorganic carbon particulate organic carbon that does not undergo dissolution settles to the bottom sediments the model nitrogen cycle fig 14 includes the following processes algal uptake and metabolism predation hydrolysis of particulate organic nitrogen mineralization of dissolved organic nitrogen settling and nitrification external loads provide the ultimate source of nitrogen to the system available nitrogen is incorporated by algae during growth and released as ammonium and organic nitrogen through respiration and predation a portion of the particulate organic nitrogen hydrolyzes to dissolved organic nitrogen the balance settles to the sediments dissolved organic nitrogen is mineralized to ammonium in an oxygenated water column a fraction of the ammonium is subsequently oxidized to nitrate nitrite through nitrification particulate nitrogen which settles to the sediments is mineralized and recycled to the water column primarily as ammonium nitrate and nitrite move in both directions across the sediment water interface depending on relative concentrations in the water column and sediment porewater the model phosphorus cycle fig 14 includes the following processes algal uptake and metabolism predation hydrolysis of particulate organic phosphorus mineralization of dissolved organic phosphorus dissolution of particulate inorganic phosphorus and settling and resuspension external loads provide the ultimate source of phosphorus to the system dissolved phosphate is incorporated by algae during growth and released as phosphate and organic phosphorus through respiration and predation dissolved organic phosphorus is mineralized to phosphate a portion of the particulate organic phosphorus hydrolyzes to dissolved organic phosphorus the balance settles to the sediments dissolution of particulate inorganic phosphorus is also possible within the sediments particulate organic phosphorus is mineralized and recycled to the water column as dissolved phosphate in the model carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycles three classes of particulate constituents are considered labile refractory and slow refractory corresponding to classes utilized in the benthic sediment diagenesis model icm includes a benthic diagenesis submodel for calculating sediment oxygen demand and sediment water nutrient flux and a sediment transport submodel for calculating sediment loading deposition erosion and transport which considers four solids size classes cerco et al 2010 cerco and noel 2013 bottom shear stress for computing erosion and deposition is a combination of stress generated by currents and surface waves harris et al 2013 a multi level bed framework tracks the distribution of each size class in each layer and stores bulk properties including layer thickness porosity and mass warner et al 2008b an sav model calculates the water clarity sav standard for the restoration of sav and accounts for positive feedbacks that improve water clarity cerco and moore 2001 a model of benthic filter feeders three filter feeder groups accounts for the effects of filtration on water quality and clarity the sediment diagenesis submodel fig 15 based on ditoro 2001 see also brady et al 2013 and clark et al 2017 is coupled to icm to account for the response of sediment water nutrient and oxygen exchanges to management actions in the watershed the spatial and computational time scales of the sediment diagenesis model are the same as the water quality model the diagenesis model considers a 10 cm thick active sediment layer that incorporates an aerobic surface layer with the remaining depth considered anaerobic the thickness of the surface aerobic layer is time variable and is calculated based on overlying water column oxygen concentration and model calculated sediment oxygen demand the aerobic first layer is much thinner than the anoxic second layer 1 2 mm vs 10 cm in the anoxic layer diagenesis of organic matter nitrogen phosphorus and carbon creates ammonium phosphate and oxygen demand respectively the fate of these substances i e release to water column release to atmosphere burial is determined by processes including nitrification denitrification sulfate reduction and methanogenesis ten years of model spin up are required to equilibrate new scenario loads with burial and refractory diagenetic processes 2 4 2 estuarine model advantages and limitations the ch3d icm combination provides computations of estuarine transport processes and water quality in three dimensions on spatial scales of meters vertical to kilometers horizontal and lateral and on an intra tidal time scale the grid is based on quadrilateral elements in the horizontal lateral plane ch3d is distinctive however in the use of non orthogonal curvilinear coordinates the non orthogonal representation implies that the grid elements are not required to meet at right angles as in models which employ orthogonal curvilinear coordinates the non orthogonal coordinate system allows improved representation of complicated channel geometry and irregular shorelines the computational grid employs a z grid representation in the vertical axis in the z grid variations in depth are represented by varying the number of cells in the vertical direction the cells are of constant thickness except for the surface cell which varies according to meteorological and tidal forcing the z grid avoids the artificial vertical mixing which is associated with sigma coordinate systems constant number of vertical cells which vary in thickness throughout the artificial mixing associated with a sigma grid was noted early in the model application and was avoided to compute bottom water anoxia in the bay channel perhaps the greatest advantage of the eutrophication component is the use of organic carbon throughout the model kinetics representations traditional water quality models were often based on alternate quantities such as biochemical oxygen demand bod or organic matter phytoplankton was quantified as chlorophyll rather than as carbon biomass as in the present model the carbon based kinetics maximize the use of current rigorous observations in the model calibration and verification and avoid the need to define quantities such as bod to chlorophyll ratio one rationale for the use of organic carbon is to make the water column kinetics consistent with the carbon based sediment diagenesis model the model is also distinctive in that the labile refractory and slow refractory carbon nitrogen and phosphorus variables in the diagenesis model have direct corresponding state variables in the water column the definition of direct corresponding state variables avoids the need to define empirical relationships between detailed representation in the sediments i e three reaction classes and less detailed representation in the water column e g total organic carbon the phytoplankton kinetics in the model cerco and noel 2004 are distinctive in that they employ to the greatest extent possible quantities currently measured in field and laboratory investigations growth is related to maximum photosynthetic rate g c g 1 chl d 1 rather than a specified daily average growth rate production is related to light via the jassby and platt 1976 relationship and is based on photosynthetically active radiation μmole photons m 2 s 1 rather than thermal units such as langleys the model has been rigorously calibrated to observed photosynthetic rates and primary production cerco and noel 2004 however as the modeling effort developed and additional capabilities were added to the ch3d icm combination some disadvantages of the grid configuration became apparent the grid went through several refinements which improved resolution in the horizontal lateral plane inevitably the limitations of representing complicated shoreline configuration with quadrilaterals emerged an unstructured grid that employs triangular elements could be a better approach the z grid represents changes in depth by varying the number of cells in the vertical when changes in depth are steep the variation in number of cells can become dramatic resembling a stairstep or even a wall this can create problems for example computing the turbidity maximum at the head of the bay using the sediment transport module is impeded by the sharp variation in number of cells at the head of the bay channel sediment moving upstream cannot climb the stairs at the head of the channel a smoothly sloping bottom would improve computation of upstream sediment transport although care must be taken not to adversely affect the representation of stratification associated with a sigma grid another problem arises when using the model in the shallow upper reaches of tributaries in such regions the model may have only one or two depth levels and hence be unable to reproduce the estuarine circulation required to effectively model salinity in the shallows in addition the outer boundary of the physical model is currently located at the bay mouth a region of sharp changes in topography and strong currents this is not ideal moving the outer boundary offshore to the continental shelf away from the mainstem bay would among other things improve simulations of future impacts of sea level rise on chesapeake bay finally the lack of coastal wetting and drying in the current model does not allow for consideration of impacts from sea level rise inundation of the coastline and its wetlands the eutrophication component incorporates representation of several living resource components including submerged aquatic vegetation sav and bivalve filter feeding organisms living resources are included based on their value to management or their necessity to the model for example correct representation of the spatial distribution of phytoplankton is impossible without incorporating the effects of filter feeders the living resource components are based on mass balance relationships a disadvantage is that the complete detailed life cycles of the living resources are not represented the simplification of the life cycles compromises the model s ability to represent the spatial and temporal distribution of the resources for example the distribution of sav is largely based on light availability while the influence of light on sav distribution is well established the distribution of sav is also influenced by recruitment and propagation which are not considered in the model the distribution of bivalves is also strongly influenced by recruitment since living resources are not the primary focus of the model the additional calibration and computational resources required for more realistic representations may not be necessary however the limitations of the current representations must be recognized creation of specific dedicated living resource models may be a superior alternative to adding complexities to the present models 2 4 3 estuarine model summary recommendations short term and long term efforts should continue the present trend of resolving finer spatial scales to make the estuarine models more directly applicable to assessing the performance of management actions at scales relevant to local communities and stakeholders prediction of locally relevant restoration outcomes may also prove a powerful incentive to motivate further investment and implementation application to smaller scales requires that the models have sufficient resolution to resolve tidal tributaries and relatively fast changes in biogeochemistry such as diel cycling hypoxia tyler et al 2009 however refining spatial scale and increasing parameters have costs in computational time development effort data requirements and parameter uncertainty some regions of the chesapeake bay may not benefit from further increases in spatial and temporal resolution and so careful consideration should be given to determining exactly where higher resolution is needed multiple approaches for improving representation at local scales are available for consideration including unstructured or nested horizontal grids the term unstructured refers to grids composed of triangles tetrahedra or irregularly shaped elements an unstructured hybrid grid with hybrid referring to grids that combine multiple types of vertical and or horizontal grid structures would be a good candidate approach because it allows for inclusion of local scale processes while maintaining efficient use of computational resources schism semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model zhang et al 2015 2016 ye et al 2018 is an example of an unstructured model fig 16 that provides advantages over the current cbp hydrodynamic model ch3d schism is an open source community supported modeling system based on hybrid triangular quadrangular unstructured grids designed for seamless simulation of 3d baroclinic circulation across creek lake river estuary shelf ocean scales it uses a highly efficient and accurate semi implicit hybrid finite element finite volume method with a eulerian lagrangian algorithm to solve the navier stokes equations in hydrostatic form to address a wide range of physical and biogeochemical processes the number of vertical layers can also be varied spatially zhang et al 2015 and thus a single schism grid can seamlessly morph between 1d 2d 3d configurations model polymorphism zhang et al 2016 the use of shaved cells i e cells that have a sloped bottom and avoid the staircase effects associated with z coordinates near the bottom not only captures the underlying bathymetry topography but also greatly improves model accuracy for bottom controlled processes such as salt intrusion and gravity overflow ye et al 2018 in addition two way online coupling rather than one way offline between the hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models is critical for enabling investigation of how biogeochemical and biological processes affect physical processes for example increased particulates in the water column will impact estuarine bottom temperature via light attenuation kim et al 2020 and sav can impact water velocities such feedbacks of the biogeochemistry on the physical fields may be important in setting local tmdls a second recommendation also longer term is to implement a modular experimental simulation framework that allows for testing of new and alternative biogeochemical formulations this would allow investigation of additional processes and alternative formulations to increase certainty in the results provided to management based on the foundational version of the coupled modeling system such a framework or testbed approach would also expand the engagement of the cbp modeling system with academic and government research communities which would facilitate incorporation of latest scientific advancements such inter model comparison approaches have been successfully performed that include the cbp estuarine model irby et al 2016 irby and friedrichs 2019 and in a comparison of shallow water models in the chester river of the bay friedrichs et al unpublished these collaborative groups of modeling teams were more effective than individual efforts in advancing the models in large part because of the balance between the teams working separately while also meeting on a regular basis to share their findings and insights a similar collaborative approach is recommended for the next generation model of the chesapeake bay estuary finally the 2014 agreement has focused attention on the prediction of management actions on living resources and thus it will be important to put more formal effort into the identification of specific types of products from the hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models that can inform living resource models the cbp partnership will benefit from the enhancement of the working relationship between hydrodynamic biogeochemical and living resource modeling groups because of the ecological economic and societal relevance of linking the chesapeake bay tmdl to living resources 2 5 estuarine living resource models 2 5 1 overview of the 2017 estuarine living resource models as discussed above the cbp modeling system includes simple sub models for sav and benthic filter feeders that are coupled to the estuarine hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry models designed with water quality effects in mind two additional living resource models chesapeake bay fisheries ecosystem management model cbfem and chesapeake bay atlantis model cam have been developed by the ncbo to support chesapeake bay restoration but these are not official components of the cbp coupled modeling system the cbfem is an implementation of ecopath with ecosim christensen et al 2009 it uses the biomass estimations of 45 trophic groups representing fisheries species of interest to the bay and their prey and predators table 2 to create a mass balanced snapshot of the trophic linkages in the bay as it may have been in 1950 townsend 2014 the 45 trophic groups include species of commercial and ecological importance represented by either single stocks sub stocks or species groups that occupy similar foraging niches as is typical for ecopath with ecosim applications the ecopath snapshot provides the base model for time dependent ecosim simulations the cbfem ecosim model simulates the annual mean biomass values of the aforementioned species and groups for 53 years 1950 2002 to provide an assessment of the recent decadal dynamics of the bay s fish species townsend 2014 the cbfem ecosim simulations have been loosely coupled to the cbp water quality model icm by forcing it with time dependent chlorophyll a townsend 2014 and sav ma et al 2010 output to assess how water quality management strategies affect living resources for the chlorophyll a application the model was used to simulate the impacts of a 40 reduction of nutrient inputs on upper trophic level species e g the biomass of striped bass and blue crabs and other commercially important fished species e g atlantic menhaden and eastern oysters townsend 2014 these simulations allow connections to be made between water quality and commercially and recreationally important species and they can be used to assess trade offs between water quality management goals and fisheries management goals the chesapeake bay atlantis model cam is in contrast to cbfem a spatially explicit three dimensional full system biogeochemical physical and trophic simulation model ihde et al 2016 ihde and townsend 2017 the cam domain is composed of 97 irregular polygons and includes the brackish waters and sediments of the mainstem chesapeake bay and eight of its largest tributaries fig 17 water movement in cam is driven by the navy coastal ocean model ncom relocatable model nutrient and sediment loads to the model are derived from the cbp dynamic watershed phase 5 3 2 model shenk and linker 2013 cam includes 26 invertebrate functional groups including primary producers and multiple bacterial groups and 29 vertebrate groups most invertebrates are modeled as single state variables mg n m 3 but two invertebrate groups blue crab and brief squid are modeled as linked juvenile and adult state variables all vertebrate groups are divided into 10 age classes each tracked by abundance and weight at age cam uses nitrogen as the currency for all state variables metabolic waste and decaying organisms form multiple forms of detritus that are cycled through bacteria to provide nutrients for both planktonic and benthic floral growth habitat types in cam include both static physical factors such as mud sand rock and woody debris and dynamic biogenic functional groups such as marsh sav and oyster reef that provide refuge for prey from predator groups fish and other animal groups are assigned a dependence to one or more of the seven habitat types and at least one such habitat must be available in a box for biomass of a group to move into that box cam has been used to estimate the higher trophic level impacts of fully achieving the goals of the u s epa tmdl requirements under present day climate conditions and warmer water temperatures habitat loss and water quality restoration tmdl under assumed future climate conditions fig 18 ihde et al 2016 ihde and townsend 2017 these simulations used nutrient and sediment loads derived from the cbp s phase 5 3 2 watershed model fig 19 ihde et al 2016 the cam and the cbfem have not been directly coupled to the cbp estuarine hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models indeed the cam overlaps the functionality of the icm because atlantis is built on its own biogeochemical model murray and parslow 1999 2 5 2 estuarine living resource models advantages and limitations estuarine living resource models are needed to estimate ecosystem status and predict the impacts of anthropogenically induced changes to forcing conditions on higher trophic level species most notably the tmdl mandated nutrient loads and altered climate unlike more targeted living resource models that simulate individual species or just a few species these ecosystem models put the population dynamics of modeled groups in the context of the entire ecosystem with predators prey and competitors providing a mechanism for achieving the larger goal of ecosystem based management simpler approaches like cbfem mainly focus on trophic factors whereas more complex approaches like cam also include the dominant physical and biogeochemical forcings the cbfem produces a mass balanced state of the ecosystem which is then used to simulate the system over time in response management actions in contrast cam is designed to estimate cumulative effects of multiple factors acting simultaneously on the system the structure of cam is spatially explicit and it is much more complex than cbfem as a result the cam model is computationally expensive and simulations can take days in comparison ecopath with ecosim produces model estimates in seconds to minutes because the cbfem and cam models integrate a variety of different data from an array of sources model estimates carry the burden of uncertainty inherent in each of those sources as a result the uncertainty of the model outputs is very large thus the cbfem and cam models are not at present applied to tactical tasks like setting fishery harvest limits instead they could be used to supplement tactical models providing contextual information such as potential ecosystem impacts and trade offs for a range of different management options to refine decision making finally it should be noted that the cbfem and cam model simulations are constrained to reflect the characteristics of the observed system yet ultimately these models may be needed to predict the future on timescales of multiple decades or more in response to future forcing conditions that have not been observed in the past thus adding even more uncertainty to the model predictions 2 5 3 estuarine living resource models summary recommendations efforts to further incorporate living resources into the cbp modeling system predictions could start with the development of additional models like cbfem and cam that use cbp model output to drive higher trophic level models in the short term outputs can be used to estimate responses to habitat changes of key species in response to management actions the current sav model in icm responds to water clarity however other factors also influence sav growth such as propagation processes and the physical characteristics of the bottom substrate these additional influences could be added to the icm model to more realistically simulate sav growth and bed expansion in response to restoration efforts and improved water clarity in the bay similar expansions to the existing formulation can be implemented for benthic filter feeders within the icm newell et al 2002 harding and mann 2001 north et al 2010 to increase their realism and include more feedbacks this approach has been used for fish population dynamics in chesapeake bay for both menhaden dalyander and cerco 2010 and bay anchovy adamack et al 2017 both efforts used an agent based lagrangian approach to simulate population dynamics but eulerian based approaches could also be implemented another short term approach is to process the output of the estuarine models to assess habitat suitability of key species for example the effect of temperature and oxygen on striped bass fig 20 habitat suitability is widely used to inform management on how altered environmental conditions will affect habitat quantity and quality e g secor et al 2009 brown et al 2013 a new generation of these habitat models such as species distribution models niche modeling and bioclimatic models are now being widely applied guisan and thuiller 2005 ehrlén and morris 2015 crear et al 2020a b models of higher trophic level habitat that use estuarine model output could be modular so that they can be easily interchangeable and allow for direct comparisons of responses across species further adapting and integrating one or both of the existing food web models with the estuarine models is another relatively short term approach the feasibility of trying to extract the higher trophic level formulations from cam and loosely or tightly couple them to ch3d and icm is an open question one role that may be important for cam is to function as a companion model to icm to address many of the goals and outcomes of the 2014 agreement that relate to higher trophic level species that are not simulated by icm in addition or alternatively the cbfem could be developed further into a spatially explicit ecospace model which would allow for loose coupling to ch3d icm as ecospace does not contain its own physical or biogeochemical model making use of the habitat capacity model within ecospace christensen et al 2014 would allow for using ch3d and icm output as environmental drivers affecting the biomass and spatial distribution of estuarine living resources comparing an ecospace version of cbfem with cam would then provide a multiple model approach for higher trophic levels lewis et al 2021 issues related to commercial and recreational fish abundances food web energetics e g pelagic versus benthic pathways system resilience and human interactions could be quantified to allow for comprehensive assessment of the costs benefits and tradeoffs of different management strategies e g wainger et al 2013 a technical challenge to the incorporation of living resources within the cbp modeling system is how to couple the models to the watershed and estuarine models ganju et al 2016 the living resources models have different temporal and spatial scales compared to the cbp watershed and estuarine models an investment in protocols and software for coupling models warner et al 2008a koralewski et al 2019 will ensure consistency in the results across the living resource models that will aid in interpretation and comparisons across species and food webs creating these protocols in the co production framework of the cbp will also serve to build the same transparency and trust that is already in place for the airshed watershed land use hydrodynamic and estuarine models the cbp partnership would benefit from the establishment an ecosystem modeling subcommittee responsible for both tidal and nontidal aquatic systems the collection of examples and food web models along with other living resource models developed outside of the cbp and fisheries management models can serve as prototypes for a more comprehensive analysis of water quality effects on chesapeake bay living resources the subcommittee should adopt a portfolio of modeling approaches for living resources that includes agreed upon protocols for 1 analyzing output from the cbp modeling system from a habitat organism perspective 2 translating cbp modeling system output to develop habitat or growth suitability indices 3 using cbp modeling system output as input for living resource and higher trophic level models and 4 integrating organisms into the icm water quality model as has been done for example with benthic filter feeders and sav an explicit strategy for further incorporating living resources into the modeling system would encourage effective and efficient progress as a starting point the subcommittee could consider nonlinear responses of living resources to nutrients and sediment new approaches and purposes for modeling primary producers that include botanical processes and re integrating consumers into the icm biogeochemical model to facilitate coupling to higher trophic levels e g zooplankton which is not explicitly included in the icm model the subcommittee could also articulate mechanisms for communication and stakeholder involvement emphasizing that modeling living resource responses allows communication of co benefits of restoration to stakeholders 3 lessons learned the cbp modeling system has contributed to several management successes that are due in large part to broad acceptance of the models by the scientific management and stakeholder communities this acceptance is the result of several factors first the members and participants of the modeling workgroup adhere to a set of core values that have promoted 1 integration of the most recent airshed watershed and estuarine research and knowledge to support modeling for restoration decision making 2 innovating embracing creativity and encouraging improvement in the development and support of transparent and robust modeling tools 3 independence in making modeling decisions on the basis of best available evidence and using the most appropriate methods to produce run and interpret models independent of policy considerations and 4 inclusiveness with a strong commitment to an open and transparent process and the engagement of relevant partners that results in strengthening the cbp s decision making tools adherence to these values for more than three decades has resulted in a buildup of trust among scientific management and stakeholder communities in addition the cbp models have always been developed in phases for example phase 6 of the watershed model development was completed in 2017 and the cbp is now working on the next generation of models for the 2025 assessment now designated as phase 7 the use of phases has several advantages it provides a subtle reminder to scientists and managers that the cbp models are continually evolving it also reminds scientists and managers of their approval of the previous modeling phase which facilitates approval of new models that are refined and improved versions of the previous model phase in addition the cbp partners and collaborators understand that whatever the current model phase it too will be further refined and the known current model limitations will be addressed going forward in the ongoing evolution of the cbp models the formal procedures for model partnership development and approval are supported by cbp s longstanding commitment to being deeply collaborative with a transparent approach to open source model development and application another approach used by the cbp scientific community to increase cbp model transparency and access is convening technical transfer workshops on the models and tools to increase understanding and promote wide use the cbp has also used its web sites and on line documentation to create an extensive public record of what has been agreed to in cbp model development including specifics of all major decisions and public access to the supporting technical material 4 summary and going forward the cbp partnership has used its linked modeling system as a planning tool to inform strategic management decisions toward bay restoration since the 1980s over the last decade the modeling system has been used to formulate the 2010 chesapeake bay tmdl evaluate progress and make midcourse adjustment in 2017 and inform the states and dc s development of three phases of watershed implementation plans that detail actions to be taken to reduce nutrients and sediment although model development has been driven by regulatory management needs the development process is built on a foundation of monitoring research and collaborative engagement that cultivates the understanding necessary to manage water quality and habitat conditions in the chesapeake bay and its watershed given past successes in the cbp modeling system there is ample evidence that new modeling tools will continue to be developed and incorporated into the modeling system to assist managers in setting communicating and achieving future tmdls under uncertain future conditions influenced by varied scenarios of bmp implementation land use and climate change envisioning the future of the cbp modeling system is timely there have been recent advances in physical and biogeochemical process understanding computer science and environmental systems modeling approaches and techniques the upcoming 2025 assessment offers an opportunity to continue this process through the use of improved models this paper provides an overview of the 2017 cbp management modeling system and presents recommendations on potential improvements for 2025 and beyond these improved models would better support and inform watershed management of nutrients and sediment for water quality goals and be an important step toward explicitly assessing management actions on living resources the recommendations are summarized for the various component models in tables 3 4 and 5 tables 3 and 4 represent the airshed land use and watershed models by short term table 3 and long term table 4 the recommendations for the remaining estuarine and living resources models are summarized in table 5 without separation by time frame but still with the order proceeding as presented in the paper which roughly places shorter term recommendations first four major themes in the recommendations that apply to all the models are the need for 1 finer spatial resolution 2 improved connectivity and coupling of the component models and 3 estimation of uncertainty modeling at higher and or variable resolution would improve input to local watershed tmdls and watershed implementation plans including fine scale atmosphere land use and watershed modeling capability this starts with the need for better representation of watershed delivery mechanisms for surface water nutrients and sediment as well as the changes to delivery patterns due to bmp implementation while the models within the modeling system are linked more explicit representation of the connectivity and coupling among the models would enhance their usability and interpretability this includes how information is transferred among models and the adoption of modular approaches there is an equally imperative demand for better simulations of the many linkages between water quality and living resources in the bay to predict the effects of attainment of nutrient reduction goals on living resources and to create opportunities to understand and leverage co benefits associated with restoration models that more fully represent higher trophic levels and ecosystem dynamics and feedbacks could provide a more complete picture of whether the conditions that support desirable living resource outcomes are being achieved many of the recommendations involve adding resolution or expanding aspects of the models and therefore have costs in computational time development effort data requirements and parameter uncertainty some regions of the model domains may not benefit from further increases in resolution and so careful consideration should be given to determining where higher resolution will result in substantial management benefits these models must be flexible and computationally efficient to enable scenario analysis with multiple runs ensembles to create probabilities of outcomes under different conditions efforts aimed at characterizing the uncertainty in the cbp partnership model projections e g irby and friedrichs 2019 should continue in addition to independent verification and sensitivity testing to understand model skill many recommendations involved attempts to increase the confidence in model predictions often by increasing resolution and by implementing more complicated process representations formal uncertainty analysis of large coupled modeling systems is a challenge allen et al 2007 pianosi et al 2016 razavi and gupta 2015 a useful exercise is to also look for opportunities to simplify processes and formulations within the models and to consider computational aspects to ensure simulations can be performed on the schedule needed by management decision making another direction to move forward is to integrate data driven and process based models karpatne et al 2017 reichstein et al 2019 shen 2018 taking advantage of the strength of both models as outlined in this paper process based models can offer process based scientific insights and cause consequence relationships machine learning techniques on the other hand can learn from data to facilitate the parameterization of process based models and reduce model uncertainty in particular in recent years deep learning approaches have gained momentum in hydrological forecasting fang et al 2019 rahmani et al 2021 shen 2018 a recent study has also shown the promise of training a deep learning model long short term memory lstm at the continental scale using largely available hydrometeorology data to forecast dissolved oxygen do an important water quality measure zhi et al 2021 the model learned the theory of do dependence on water temperature it also indicated the critical needs of data collection under conditions that lead to do peaks and troughs further data driven model development can potentially lead to insights of temporal trends and spatial patterns that can advance hydro biogeochemical theories and forecasting capabilities for water quality response to changing climate and human perturbations the development of the coupled modeling system and its use to inform management was and will continue to be a long term process and investment the cbp partnership will benefit from continuing its efforts to increase stakeholder engagement to create a shared vision of effective restoration strategies and to help guide model development and application linkages to the scientific community are also important to maintain the pressure of peer review so the models are up to date the trust accumulated to date must be maintained into the future as recommendations are considered and implemented

bay program and its modeling system the chesapeake bay hereafter the bay is the largest most productive and most biologically diverse estuary in the continental united states providing crucial habitat for native plant and animal species many of which are migratory boesch et al 2001 kemp et al 2005 natural economic benefits derived from the bay have been valued at more than 100 billion annually cbf 2014 the bay supports economically important fisheries with blue crabs striped bass and oysters generating the largest revenue dewar et al 2009 and shellfish aquaculture activities growing rapidly hudson et al 2016 the bay waters also enhance coastal property values and support a vital tourist economy including nature based recreation industries klemick et al 2018 however increases in agricultural activity urbanization suburban sprawl stream alterations and air pollution since colonial times and intensification since the mid 20th century have led to excessive nutrient and sediment inputs entering the bay brush 2009 adversely affecting the health of the bay ecosystem and the economic services it provides cbf 2014 since the mid 1900s increases in nutrient and sediment inputs to

harmful algal blooms habs hypoxia reduces the catch per unit effort of fish that feed in deep waters of the bay and can lead to fish kills buchheister et al 2013 habs can adversely affect the ecosystem by degrading water quality and can impact human health by contaminating shellfish they consume e g via neurotoxic amnesic or diarrhetic shellfish poisoning glibert et al 2005 landsberg et al

al 2008 glibert and burford 2017 van dolah et al 2016 recreational fisheries in the bay are also sensitive to water clarity because visual predation is necessary for fishing lures to attract economically important game fish macdonald et al 2009 and degraded water clarity is aesthetically apparent to coastal residents and tourists klemick et al 2018 the chesapeake bay program cbp is a partnership formally created in 1983 to guide and foster restoration of the chesapeake bay and its watershed this partnership includes all six states within the bay watershed virginia maryland pennsylvania west virginia delaware and new york and the district of columbia d c plus hundreds of federal state and local government agencies academic institutions and nonprofit interest groups the cbp partnership formed out of concerns regarding the loss of submerged aquatic vegetation sav and extensive low oxygen hypoxic and anoxic waters in the bay referred to as dead zones documented locally as early as the 1930 s kemp et al 2005 since its inception the cbp partnership has relied on a complex coupled modeling system to predict the watershed loads of total nitrogen phosphorus and sediment that the chesapeake bay can receive while still maintaining acceptable water quality in terms of dissolved oxygen concentrations water clarity and chlorophyll a concentration the 2010 version of this coupled modeling system cerco et al 2010 linker et al 2013a b shenk and linker 2013 specifically estimated the total maximum daily loads tmdls of nitrogen phosphorus and sediment that could be allowed to reach bay waters such that the tidal water quality standards were still met as mandated by the clean water act the 2014 chesapeake bay watershed agreement marked a substantial advancement in the restoration effort for the bay with all seven major watershed jurisdictions signing onto an expanded vision of bay management cbp 2014 the 2014 agreement outlines five themes related to abundant life clean water climate change conserved lands and engaged communities and provides specific goals and measurable outcomes associated with targeted timelines and ecological endpoints to evaluate success within each theme the 2014 agreement also brought an important motivational shift in efforts to restore the chesapeake bay the 2014 agreement and its creative framework of themes goals and outcomes incentivizes the changes necessary to achieve the tmdl levels by clearly identifying and leveraging diverse outcomes of societal benefit and value to stakeholder communities in the watershed however the current cbp modeling system retains its historical focus primarily on the strict regulatory interpretation of the tmdls and associated water quality outcomes modeling outcomes inform the management plans of individual jurisdictions and the overall strategy of the cbp partnership specifically efforts to reduce point and nonpoint pollution sources including regulations designed to restrict pollutant transport into the chesapeake bay and u s coastal waters over the past four decades the cbp modeling system has significantly evolved as understanding of processes operating in the bay and its watershed have advanced and management questions progressed the cbp modeling system released in 2017 has multiple components airshed land use watershed estuarine hydrodynamic and water quality models these sub models determine chesapeake bay tmdls in that they are used to force either directly or indirectly the biogeochemistry model that predicts changes in oxygen concentration water clarity and chlorophyll a concentration that result from changes in nutrient and sediment loads the cbp partnership has also promoted the development of living resource models to advance habitat restoration for targeted estuarine species of concern these include models of submerged aquatic vegetation sav and benthic filter feeders directly linked to the estuarine hydrodynamic and water quality models as well as stand alone ecosystem models that simulate interactions of numerous higher trophic level species e g fish crabs by using various outputs of the coupled modeling system as inputs 1 2 history of the chesapeake bay program modeling system the component models of the cbp modeling system and their coupling have been continually updated in response to emerging science and changing water quality and ecological management priorities since the 1980s linker et al 2002 2013a models have been periodically fixed at milestone states of development and then used to evaluate performance of investments implemented to meet tmdl targets for nitrogen phosphorus and sediment and to assess the sufficiency of strategies to raise dissolved oxygen concentrations in the bay to levels determined necessary to support estuarine ecosystem services it is important to emphasize that the chesapeake bay tmdls are specifically designed to meet water quality standards to support living resources for example the limits on deep water dissolved oxygen concentrations have been established to protect juvenile and adult fish as well as shellfish see table 2 in irby and friedrichs 2019 and tango and batiuk 2013 modeling results have also been used to evaluate water quality standards related to the proliferation of sav as well as necessary thresholds for water clarity and chlorophyll a concentrations usepa 2010 the tmdl targets were first legally formalized by the cbp partnership in 2010 usepa 2010 and they were updated most recently with the 2017 midpoint assessment usepa 2018 using the 2017 version of the cbp modeling system to evaluate the contemporary state of the restoration developments in the cbp modeling system from its inception in 1982 to the 2017 milestone i e 2017 midpoint assessment include substantial increases in spatial and temporal resolution in the component airshed watershed and estuarine models and deeper integration with other modeling activities outside of the component models an example of the deeper integration is the recent incorporation of the spatially referenced regressions on watershed attributes sparrow ator et al 2011 model with the most recent 2017 phase 6 version of the watershed model web based distribution of open source public domain model source codes executable models data results documentation tools to assess the effects of management actions on nutrient and sediment loads to the bay and general support of multiple models irby et al 2016 have contributed to the development of the cbp modeling system all of the sub models are now open source and available for use and further development by the research and management communities either directly through the internet or via request these efforts have increased the transparency and accessibility of the cbp modeling system provided opportunities for intermodel comparisons increased stakeholder engagement and fostered trust in the models and their predictions the general acceptance of the cbp modeling system for informing management decisions involved a deliberate and extensive process of review and engagement appendix c of the 2010 tmdl usepa 2010 lists 433 meetings where the tmdl and or models used in the tmdl were the principal topics of the meeting 2005 2010 and 297 additional meetings where the tmdl and or models were on the agenda 2008 2010 the meetings occurred both within the committee and workgroup structure of the cbp at federal state and nongovernmental partner organizations and through scheduled public forums and webinars generally stakeholder working groups primarily the cbp s water quality goal implementation team and its workgroups determine how the models will be used to assist decision making these groups are also charged with determining appropriate model inputs related to land use agricultural systems and management actions according to the best available data technical working groups primarily the modeling workgroup determine the structure and parameterization of the models and inputs such as atmosphere and ocean forcing functions the cbp s scientific and technical advisory committee stac also plays two key roles in model development stac supports broadly attended workshops that encourage cross fertilization of ideas and result in scientific recommendations to the cbp that drive the development of models the foundation of this paper is one such workshop stac also forms committees that perform independent scientific peer reviews of the models e g easton et al 2017 the overall review process and the roles of different groups within and outside of the cbp are discussed in section 1 of the chesapeake assessment scenario tool cast documentation cbp 2020a the participatory development process has expanded in scope over time with earlier models primarily receiving scientific review and later models increasingly receiving review and input from the stakeholder community the process resulted in a steady evolution of the models so they were up to date but also grounded with empirical information this multi decade process of development and feedback has led to a linked modeling system with sufficient transparency and accrued trust so the results are accepted by a wide range of managers and stakeholders as well as by the scientific community the multi decadal process is ongoing with leadership provided for many years by a small group of people at the cbp including coauthors r batiuk l linker and g shenk this experience with the cbp modeling system provides a template for how complicated models can be developed and directly used to inform large scale management decisions as part of the 2017 midpoint assessment the cbp partnership concluded there were no fatal flaws in the milestone 2017 modeling system i e an absence of flaws substantial enough to invalidate its use for decision making by the cbp partnership the 2017 modeling system provided improvements over previous versions cbp 2020a and incorporated feedback from the scientific community and key stakeholders three key groups reviewed the 2017 cbp modeling system 1 the scientific and technical advisory committee stac composed primarily of scientists that advise the cbp 2 the water quality goal implementation team and its workgroups whose membership includes managers stakeholders non governmental organizations and scientists and 3 technical managers and scientists in the modeling workgroup cbp 2020a section 13 starting in 2019 federal state and local jurisdictions have been applying the 2017 modeling system to aid in the development of the phase iii watershed implementation plans these are plans of local management actions designed for their jurisdictional waters to meet the tmdls that will guide water quality management in the chesapeake bay region until the scheduled bay wide assessment in 2025 the science and modeling based approaches to coproduce knowledge formulate solutions to problems and adaptively guide restoration activities is fundamental to the environmental management approach of the cbp partnership and will continue into the foreseeable future particularly as plans are now being made for a next generation modeling system to incorporate new science and monitoring expand the capability of the models and to assess the challenge of 2035 climate change to achieving chesapeake water quality standards 1 3 management perspectives the cbp modeling system was developed specifically to inform management formulations and testing of the models are therefore driven by regulatory management needs the linked models are regulatory models distinct from parallel computational platforms for exploratory research oriented modeling activities that are also ongoing in the bay region e g xu and hood 2006 xu et al 2011 feng et al 2015 wiggert et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 2016 irby et al 2016 irby and friedrichs 2019 st laurent et al 2020 ator and garcia 2016 ator et al 2019 testa et al 2017 as a tool for management with specific deadlines and milestones the cbp modeling system must also be available and ready to be used for the next set of questions and decisions on a schedule that meets management deadlines examples of major court and management policy mandated deadlines are the assessments for the 2010 tmdl 2017 midpoint assessment and upcoming 2025 assessment environmental managers from watershed jurisdictions use results from the coupled modeling system to guide water quality management decisions within their local subregions a major use of the modeling system is to develop equitable nutrient and sediment loading targets across state and local jurisdictions and inform efficient implementation of best management practices bmps managers use the modeling system to 1 set nutrient and sediment reduction targets 2 configure nutrient and sediment reduction plans to meet the targets and 3 quantify progress towards the implementation of reduction plans and local and bay wide restoration goals the expansion of the restoration goals in the 2014 agreement inspired further consideration of whether and how the coupled modeling system can be used beyond the past focus on prescriptive water quality issues under the 2014 agreement managers need information to assess progress related to living resources in the bay and its watershed and consider the effects of climate change and would benefit from models that can populate a decision support system to analyze trade offs and co benefits and to further encourage stakeholder engagement chesapeake bay restoration accomplishments including development of the linked modeling system are cultivated through collaborations among government and nongovernment researchers primarily academics creating opportunities for engagement among groups of managers and scientists who monitor measure test and model processes relevant to the entire socioecological system comprising the chesapeake bay and its watershed these collaborations open novel opportunities for model based experiments to test hypotheses and validate cbp model findings this is where the regulatory cbp modeling system and research oriented models intersect inform and influence each other model comparisons can reveal consistencies and contradictions between cbp model findings and other models or observations e g irby and friedrichs 2019 st laurent et al 2019 resulting in an enhanced understanding of underlying assumptions and processes that ultimately improve the cbp modeling system the cbp modeling system informs bay policy and funding decisions that involve billions of dollars in public and private environmental investments see for example https www epa gov sites production files 2016 03 documents 2015 06 pdf therefore the cbp modeling system has to be scientifically defensible transparent timely useful to manage current environmental issues and representative of the needs of stakeholders in multiple jurisdictions field research and monitoring data are crucial components used to develop and evaluate models whose outputs are used to guide management efforts targeted research informed by modeling is essential to efficiently advance resource management nichols and williams 2006 these tools must also assist managers to quantify benefits costs uncertainties and risks models that contribute to satisfying these requirements create a consistent documented foundation on which to base legislation regulations and investments 1 4 successes and emerging challenges the cbp modeling system has played a crucial role in recent management successes these include the achievement of the 2025 goals for nitrogen and phosphorus pollutant load reductions collectively from hundreds of chesapeake bay watershed municipal and industrial wastewater treatment facilities a decade early dance 2016 in addition trends in recent years suggest that the summertime anoxic volume i e dead zone is decreasing fig 1 and see ni et al 2020 and sav has shown signs of recovering lefcheck et al 2018 see also cbp 2020c however the cbp modeling system will need to evolve and advance to address new challenges to provide managers with relevant information the most daunting future challenge is ensuring the modeling system can inform management decisions under a changing natural and human environment globally influenced changes in regional weather patterns and sea level rise are affecting temperature watershed dynamics estuarine hydrodynamics biogeochemistry and ecology e g irby et al 2018 lefcheck et al 2017 st laurent et al 2020 testa et al 2018 ni et al 2020 in addition increasing human population in the watershed will continue to influence stressors that will interact with the effects of climate change and sea level rise the human population in the chesapeake bay watershed is projected to increase by about 12 percent from 2010 to 2025 17 3 million to 19 4 million cbp 2020b the 2014 agreement explicitly addresses climate change with goals and outcomes related to climate resiliency monitoring assessment and adaptation these considerations challenge the cbp modeling system to ensure that the modeling results can inform these goals in addition to its recognition of climate change relevance another notable aspect of the 2014 agreement is its identification of goals and targets that go beyond water quality based metrics for example the 2014 agreement highlights consideration of the effects that water quality has on tidal and nontidal living resources which beyond sav and benthic filter feeders have not been a prior focus the modeling system would need to expand its capabilities to other species in order to support multiple objective decision making that could better encompass the associated broader set of goals such as the simultaneous impacts to habitat quality and quantity a variety of aquatic organisms and fisheries harvests in response to restoration relating management induced water quality responses to living resources is a formidable task considering the diverse species and habitats involved and that multiple factors beyond bay water quality and habitat e g ocean conditions and societally driven global and local harvests can also affect most living resources another class of challenges centers on the scale of the predictions from the cbp modeling system high resolution simulations to guide the design implementation and performance evaluation of optimal water quality management practices at local scales are in high demand for example the current watershed model in the cbp modeling system averages many conditions for a given land use within a county potentially obscuring the importance of implementing best management practices where they can best reduce and prevent nutrient and sediment runoff easton et al 2020 local and state governments responsible for implementing management actions related to the tmdls have expressed interest in maximizing co benefits of their investments on nutrient and sediment controls co benefits are ecosystem services that achieve nutrient and sediment reduction objectives while also addressing 2014 agreement outcomes related to flood control open space amenities recreational uses terrestrial species habitat and healthy fisheries some cbp managers need tools that predict localized responses of interest e g nontidal stream health while others need tools suitable for integration across jurisdictions to achieve regional and bay wide goals 2 the cbp modeling system and recommendations for future development this paper summarizes the results of a 2018 workshop designed to identify needed modifications and advancements to the cbp modeling system to address the emerging management questions and challenges spurred by the 2014 agreement and scheduled to be assessed in 2025 the workshop hood et al 2019 involved academic and government scientists and managers active in the cbp partnership who were specifically tasked to review the status of the modeling system as of 2017 reflect upon the history of cbp modeling efforts and offer guidance on future research needs and priorities the development of the cbp modeling system offers lessons learned that are relevant to other large watershed estuarine systems facing similar water quality impairments and management challenges recommendations were developed during workshop breakout sessions that began the afternoon of the first day and continued through the morning of the third and final day of the workshop breakout groups were formed for land change modeling watershed hydrology watershed nitrogen watershed phosphorus watershed sediment estuarine hydrodynamics estuarine biogeochemistry and estuarine living resources breakout groups leaders were charged with delivering a short bulleted list of high priority recommendations to be reported in plenary in the final workshop session leaders sought to develop consensus within the breakout sessions around the priority recommendations during the workshop leaders with the assistance of interested workshop participants wrote related sections of the workshop report hood et al 2019 that emphasized the priority recommendations but also more fully addressed the workshop questions as mentioned above the cbp modeling system fig 2 comprises airshed land use watershed and estuarine models the airshed model predicts changes in atmospheric deposition of inorganic nitrogen and other selected species on the watershed and tidal bay due to changes in emissions the land use model predicts changes in land use sewage and septic systems in response to shifts in population expected housing and commercial property demand and land use policies the watershed model combines the output of these models with other data sources such as implemented bmps and the us census of agriculture to predict the point source and non point source distributed loads of nitrogen phosphorus and sediment entering the bay for the nine major tributary rivers and along shorelines of the bay and its many estuarine tributaries the estuarine hydrodynamic and biogeochemistry models predict variations in bay circulation and water quality due to changes in input loads provided by the watershed model changes in atmospheric forcing and regional effects of climate change i e sea level rise and changes in precipitation and temperature in addition the biogeochemistry model can simulate the impacts of changes in water quality on sav and benthic filter feeders finally there are currently two living resource models developed by the noaa chesapeake bay office ncbo that are not part of the cbp modeling system but can use output from the estuarine hydrodynamic and biogeochemistry models to assess how changes in water quality due to management actions might impact higher trophic levels the components of the cbp modeling system including the ncbo living resource models are all loosely coupled in that data are transferred manually from one sub model to another i e the output data of one model are transferred to a downstream model this loose coupling has the advantage of facilitating work flow because the cbp sub models are often used for separate tasks and at separate times for example the estuarine biogeochemistry model determines the allowable nutrient and sediment loads that will meet water quality standards and is run infrequently for goal setting the watershed model typically has thousands of scenarios run each year on how to achieve the allowable loads the airshed model provides a limited range of national emission reduction scenarios from the clean air act that can be considered by cbp decision makers loose coupling also improves scenario analysis efficiency that is it is easier to work on a single model for the numerous sensitivity runs and tests that are required for each launch application of the cbp models note however that some of the cbp sub models are fully coupled i e where the feedback loops are too critical to do otherwise for example the sav and benthic filter feeder models mentioned above and described in section 2 4 1 are directly coupled to the estuarine biogeochemistry model so that they can provide continuous dynamic feedback to one another 2 1 airshed model 2 1 1 overview of the 2017 airshed model the airshed model in the coupled system is the open source community multiscale air quality cmaq fig 3 foley et al 2010 cmaq itself consists of a series of coupled models meteorological emission and photochemical air quality that work in concert to estimate the emissions and fates of atmospheric gaseous and particulate pollutants acid nutrient or toxic and their precursors foley et al 2010 cmaq predicts the fate of these pollutants as they transport through the airshed and deposit back to earth s surface or react to form secondary pollutants cmaq is maintained by the u s environmental protection agency epa center for environmental measurements and modeling and since its initial release in 1998 cmaq has been widely used to evaluate potential national regional and state specific air quality policy management decisions cmaq can be used to explore different meteorological and atmospheric pollutant emission scenarios campbell et al 2019 for example cmaq is often used to test the impact of future emission regulations on deposition and determine which individual emission sources are the largest contributors to air pollution at a site zhang et al 2012 cmaq s generalized and flexible formulation has enabled incorporation of alternate process algorithms and numerical solutions to include new science in the model to address increasingly complex air pollution issues cmaq requires two primary types of inputs meteorological information and emission rates from sources that affect air quality the cmaq version 5 0 2 model used with the 2017 cbp modeling system has a 3 dimensional domain that covers the north american continent at a 12 12 km grid scale fig 4 that includes the chesapeake bay watershed and bay tidal waters the model uses year specific meteorological inputs from the weather research and forecasting wrf skamarock and klemp 2008 model and combines hourly emissions data from the u s epa s national emissions inventory with the open source sparse matrix operator kernel emissions smoke model to estimate the magnitude and location of pollution sources cmaq then calculates atmospheric transport transformation and deposition of a suite of anthropogenic pollutants including ozone particulate matter toxics acid deposition and several forms of oxidized e g nox and reduced e g nh3 nitrogen the 2002 to 2012 cmaq simulations used the bidirectional nh3 exchange option where the surface ammonia flux is modeled as a gradient based process that can result in emissions from land use with enriched ammonium concentrations in the soil or vegetation e g agriculture or deposition to land to better capture the observed variability in nh3 dry deposition bash et al 2013 cmaq is continuously evaluated against network satellite and field sampled atmospheric chemistry and air quality observations cmaq effectively describes seasonal variability and trends 2002 2012 in oxidized and reduced nitrogen wet deposition and in ambient oxidized nitrogen concentrations over its broad domain which gives confidence that wet and dry deposition of nitrogen to the chesapeake bay watershed are also simulated well bash et al 2013 qiang zhang et al 2019a 2 1 2 airshed model advantages and limitations the cmaq model is based on first principles and is not calibrated to specific monitoring stations however cmaq is routinely evaluated against network observations to assess its performance in capturing the magnitude and trends in ambient concentrations and wet deposition at monitoring sites appel et al 2021 zhang et al 2019a kelly et al 2019 starting with cmaq v5 3 there is an option for land use specific dry deposition appel et al 2021 this option allows better integration of flux estimates from the model grid cells with a grid spacing on the order of 10s of km with critical loads assessments and dry deposition impacts on water quality where finer scale details are necessary due to differences in the retention and sensitivity of different land uses to pollutant nitrogen deposition in the chesapeake bay watershed however where dry deposition accounts for approximately half of the atmospheric nitrogen loading modeling of this deposition cannot be sufficiently evaluated due to the lack of a routine dry deposition monitoring network to mitigate this uncertainty model algorithms were developed from field scale observations e g bash et al 2013 but this results in uncertainty for land use types where these detailed measurements are absent additionally ambient atmospheric measurements of nitric acid and ammonia primary components of nitrogen dry deposition are uncommon making even a qualitative evaluation difficult wang et al 2021 improvements in satellite air quality measurements specifically nh3 wang et al 2021 are filling in many of these measurement gaps but do not yet have a sufficient history of observations to assess trends in ambient concentrations 2 1 3 airshed model summary recommendations in the short term research should focus on the influence of climate change on the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen as wet dry and organic nitrogen deposition the cmaq model should include the full characterization of organic nitrogen deposition including pollen and other particulate forms to better constrain mass balances of nitrogen deposition to surface waters in watersheds and coastal systems organic nitrogen deposition can be an important atmospheric nitrogen source in many areas and is currently underestimated by cmaq 5 0 2 and earlier versions in most areas a second area of short term focus is better quantification of the biases in predicted oxidized nitrogen concentrations in cmaq to improve the accuracy of model predictions for the chesapeake bay watershed portion of the grid land use specific deposition estimates should be adopted that have been validated against field measurements the process of validating the deposition estimates will help guide efforts to reduce parameter uncertainty and provide loading estimates that are more relevant to watershed transport processes and mitigation e g riparian buffers in the long term cmaq should be run at a higher spatial resolution with a nonuniform horizontal grid and apply methods to enable more complete quantification of the effects of parameter uncertainty on model predictions a more resolved model grid could improve prediction for the chesapeake bay subregion because the current 12 12 km resolution fails to fully resolve the observed spatial variability in atmospheric deposition especially with deposition related to sea breezes along major transportation corridors and for other processes dependent on local scales an unstructured grid would allow for higher resolution where it is needed while also keeping computational demands reasonable output from cmaq is used as inputs to other models and sensitivity analyses would provide the basis for propagating uncertainty through the coupled modeling system other long term priorities are developing the ability to make more direct connections to the watershed model and estuarine hydrodynamic and biogeochemistry models and evaluation of parameterization throughout the entire model domain more direct connections to other cbp models that receive deposition predictions e g providing cmaq with specific information about land use from the watershed model and or specific information about temperature and heat exchange from the hydrodynamic model would enable the model to better capture feedbacks 2 2 land use change model 2 2 1 overview of the 2017 land use change model the u s geological survey began developing the chesapeake bay land change model cblcm in 2012 fig 5 to inform how land use planning and land conservation decisions would impact water quality and wildlife habitats the cblcm was developed in response to two stac sponsored independent scientific peer reviews of earlier modeling efforts at forecasting land change effects the reviews emphasized among other issues the need to simulate multiple future scenarios and to explicitly quantify and communicate model uncertainties pyke et al 2008 and pyke et al 2010 results from the cblcm are used to inform the locality specific phase iii watershed implementation plans developed by maryland pennsylvania west virginia and several counties in virginia wip 2019a b c d the cblcm is a pseudo cellular automata urban growth model that stochastically simulates the future footprint of residential and commercial development associated with growth in population and employment fig 6 see also output posted on the phase 6 viewer at https chesapeake usgs gov phase6 map the 2017 version of the model incorporates data from 2013 onward to forecast annual development to 2025 at a 30 meter cell resolution and associated conversions of forest and farmland and changes in the populations served by sewer or septic systems the model s forecasts are based on 1 state sanctioned projections of population and employment 2 population and housing data and trends reported by u s census bureau 3 land cover trends derived from the national land cover database homer et al 2015 4 mapped protected lands and sewer service areas and 5 county level zoning data for the baseline scenario the cblcm simulates residential and commercial growth within individual counties by first assessing the amount of future county level housing and employment that will occur as infill or redevelopment within census urbanized areas remaining future housing and employment represent demands for greenfield residential and commercial development respectively greenfield residential development is simulated by stochastically allocating seed cells of residential growth onto a residential probability surface the residential probability surface is derived through logistic regression comparing randomly sampled observations of growth within residential areas e g change in national land cover database developed area classes 21 24 within census block groups with a housing to jobs ratio greater than one with randomly sampled explanatory variables estimated for all areas suitable for growth i e unprotected gently sloped and undeveloped lands a residential seed will sprout and grow into a patch of residential development if the value of the probability surface at the seed cell location exceeds a random value assigned to the seed the patch growth routine is the pseudo cellular automata part of the model seed cells grow over a resistance surface weighted by proximity to the seed and proximity to the nearest road residential patch size potentials for each seed are randomly selected from the observed patch size distribution of residential development occurring between 2001 and 2011 as a patch is grown households are accumulated within the patch from an underlying housing density surface patches stop growing when either the maximum patch size is reached the county level demand for housing is met or localized obstructions to growth e g roads steep slopes open water protected lands prevent the patch from achieving its assigned size this entire process is repeated for greenfield commercial growth using the greenfield demand for jobs and raster surfaces representing employment probability job density and commercial areas for any given future scenario the cblcm simulates 101 independent monte carlo iterations the results of which are then averaged by watershed model land river segment described in section 2 3 these stochastic iterations enable the assessment of model uncertainty associated with the growth allocation process for every land river segment the relative standard deviation of future development is calculated to model uncertainty in addition the results of the logistic regressions are saved for every scenario and can be inspected to understand the explanatory power of the residential and commercial probability surfaces in addition to the baseline current zoning scenario the cblcm is capable of simulating alternative future scenarios of residential and commercial development through adjustments to the county level population and employment projections proportion of infill to greenfield development and proportion of urban to rural development areas suitable for development housing and employment densities and the extent of sewer service areas can also be adjusted uniquely for any given scenario e g fig 7 to support development of the phase iii watershed implementation plans 13 alternative future scenarios representing 2025 land use conditions were created by the cbp partnership and run through the cblcm and watershed model these scenarios include historic trends current zoning forest conservation agricultural conservation growth management and eight custom jurisdictional scenarios known as land policy bmps for the jurisdictions of d c delaware maryland 3 scenarios pennsylvania virginia and west virginia descriptions of these scenarios can be found in the scenario section of the user documentation for the chesapeake assessment scenario tool cbp 2020b the cblcm is designed to simulate plausible long term average levels of residential and commercial land use change unlike land cover change which can be consistently observed by satellites over time land use change is challenging to validate because few areas have been consistently mapped for land use over multiple time periods fortunately maryland maintains statewide tax parcel data attributed to land use and year built fields which can be used to validate county level rates of residential and commercial land consumption simulated by the cblcm rates were estimated as acres of consumption per year per housing unit and per job modeled residential land consumption rates were compared from 2013 to 2025 against observed residential rates for 2001 2011 and 2011 2019 for most counties the cblcm simulated plausible but higher residential land consumption rates compared to observations over the more recent 2011 2019 period and lower residential land consumption rates compared to observations over the earlier period 2001 2011 the nationwide housing boom occurred during the former period as did high levels of suburban sprawl development in contrast during the latter period the nation was recovering from an economic recession for commercial growth the cblcm simulated plausible but higher rates of land consumption over the single observation period 2006 2016 this is largely due to an under estimation of job densities jobs acre particularly in rural counties 2 2 2 land use change model advantages and limitations for input to watershed and water quality models accurately simulating land use is more important than accurately simulating land cover because it is more relevant to nutrient and sediment loading rates for example the land uses of turf grass and cropland have the same cover type herbaceous yet very different nutrient inputs and yields as another example a land use model will simulate the entire footprint of large lot residential development and not just the impervious portions as a regional land use model some specific advantages of the cblcm are that it simulates urban infill redevelopment residential and commercial greenfield development and distinguishes between growth on sewer versus septic systems the cblcm can also simulate multiple stochastic iterations of growth per scenario enabling the quantification of spatial uncertainty moreover the cblcm estimates residential and commercial densities which are necessary for deriving impervious cover from land use and are essential for land use planning the central limitation of the cblcm is that it is challenging to validate because no states except maryland have data for consistently mapping land use over multiple time periods accurately simulating urban land use change requires estimation and prediction of the demand for land density of development and the portion of growth attributable to infill and redevelopment the cblcm attempts to estimate and predict all three of these components but validation to date has been very limited 2 2 3 land use change model summary recommendations areas of focus for improving cblcm in the long term include further specification of possible futures and improved code design the functionality and transparency of cblcm could be improved by leveraging results from regional transportation models e g motor vehicle emission simulator moves koupal et al 2013 kall et al 2014 liu 2015 and household microsimulation models e g simple integrated land use orchestrator silo moeckel 2017 and enhanced representation of population cohorts i e by age and income and employment sectors e g services administrative financial warehousing in addition efforts should be undertaken to incorporate temporally dynamic feedbacks between development capacity density growth probability and spillover as well as spatial allocation of infill development and redevelopment within urban areas with limits based on wastewater treatment capacity the high resolution land use data for the chesapeake bay watershed could be used to exclude already developed lands from future greenfield development more effectively the cblcm should also be modified to allow simulation of future 1 changes in cropping systems pasture and farm animals 2 changes in forests including changes in composition phenology seral stage and disturbance and 3 conditions consistent with a range of representative concentration pathways rcps and sea level rise scenarios and their associated population and employment projections finally a modular design should be adopted using open source code and leveraging cloud computing and storage resources 2 3 watershed model 2 3 1 overview of the 2017 phase 6 watershed model the watershed model estimates freshwater sediment nitrogen and phosphorus loads to the chesapeake bay from multiple sources in the watershed and determines how different management actions would affect these loadings there are two versions of the 2017 model which are constrained to produce identical output over the long term 1 a time averaged average annual loads version widely used by the cbp partnership for scenario assessments and watershed implementation plan development and 2 a dynamic version used in calibration and to drive the estuarine models for full documentation of both versions and the relationship between them see cbp 2020a 2 3 1 1 time averaged watershed model the cbp uses the time averaged version of the 2017 watershed model in the chesapeake tmdl to set planning targets design implementation plans and track the progress in implementation of nutrient reduction efforts relative to their goals chesapeake assessment scenario tool cast cbp 2020a cast provides estimates of average annual loads that would be expected given ten years of typical weather conditions typical weather conditions were defined by the cbp during the tmdl process as the period 1991 2000 importantly this model is intended to calculate the nitrogen phosphorus and sediment load annually delivered to the tidal bay from each land use within each segment given a set of management options scenarios of management options may include land use estimates from the cblcm atmospheric deposition from cmaq specification of point source and septic system discharges and implementation of urban best management practices and agricultural conservation practices collectively referred to as bmps the structure of the time averaged 2017 watershed model for nitrogen and phosphorus load predictions is organized by nine primary components fig 8 the approach for estimating nutrient loads involves several sequential computations the top line in fig 8 average loads δ inputs and sensitivities represents the calculation of water quality loads exported from a land use to a stream in a watershed segment taking into account local applications of nutrients but not local watershed conditions e g watershed location geology the average load represents the chesapeake bay watershed wide average annual load per acre for a given land use type δ inputs represents the local deviation from the chesapeake bay watershed wide mean input rate in pounds per acre for inputs such as fertilizer manure and atmospheric deposition sensitivity is the change in load to a stream from a unit change in an input sensitivity factors are specific to land use and input types after nutrient loads to a stream are derived from the initial step described above the loads are then multiplied by the acres of the land use in the watershed segment land use acres and modified by the effect of implemented local bmps land to water factors are then applied to account for spatial differences in loads due to physical watershed characteristics land to water factors do not add to or subtract from the loads over the entire chesapeake bay watershed instead they represent the spatial variability of nutrient delivery the application of the four components results in an estimate of nutrient loads delivered to a stream or water body in a land river segment after nutrient loads delivered to a stream are estimated in the previous step stream delivery factors are then applied to account for processes influencing nutrient concentrations in stream flows with a mean annual discharge less than 100 cubic feet per second conceptually these are attenuation factors that act to decrease nutrient delivery in small streams as the loads move downstream to the boundary of the larger river reaches river delivery factors account for nutrient attenuation processes in the larger rivers finally direct loads are nutrient loads that do not come from the land surface or subsurface and include point sources stream bank erosion and direct deposition of livestock manure in streams fig 9 shows the major nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to the time averaged model from 1985 to 2019 and fig 10 shows annual mean total nitrogen and phosphorus loads in the chesapeake bay watershed for the year 2017 simulated by the time averaged model each component in fig 8 is represented by simple coefficients however the technical methods of deriving the coefficients through a collaborative process can be quite complex the cbp partnership has used multiple models and multiple lines of evidence from scientific observations wherever possible to estimate the coefficients for example average loads are calculated using the average of several fully calibrated models table 1 other coefficients are borrowed directly from companion models land to water and stream to river factors are taken directly from usgs sparrow simulations of the chesapeake bay watershed ator et al 2011 while land use acres are from the cblcm and atmospheric deposition is from cmaq bmp reduction factors are estimated by a collaborative expert literature review process e g berg et al 2013 river to bay factors are calculated from the calibrated dynamic model full description of the sources of information and the cbp partnership decisions are available cbp 2020a the time averaged structure for sediment load prediction is similar to the nine components described above for nutrients but with some important differences in source and delivery estimation the top line of fig 8 rather than representing edge of stream nutrients now pertains to field mobilized sediments these sediment loads are estimated using a spatial application of rusle revised universal soil loss equation predictions usda 2013 land to water factors are now conceptualized as delivery ratios for mobilized sediment and are implemented based on observations of yield reductions across a range of increasing watershed drainage area sizes cavalli et al 2013 roehl 1962 direct load sources are similar to those for nutrients with stream erosion playing a greater role net average annual reductions in sediment loads within streams are assumed to be low relative to other terms in the model based on sparrow results brakebill et al 2010 and sediment budgets noe et al 2020 therefore stream to river factors are set such that they counteract erosion sources reductions to sediment loads due to reservoir sedimentation are estimated using approaches designed for the sparrow model load estimation approach brakebill et al 2010 2 3 1 2 dynamic watershed model the cbp partnership also maintains a dynamic version of the watershed model to provide daily loads to the estuarine water quality model and to estimate some parameters such as river delivery factors and stormwater runoff for use in the time averaged model the relationship between the time averaged and the dynamic models is depicted in fig 11 the dynamic model uses hydrological simulation program fortran hspf see borah and bera 2004 to simulate hydrology sediment transport and nutrient transport in streams hspf simulates time dependent hydrologic and water quality processes on land surfaces in the subsurface in streams and within well mixed impoundments nutrient export from the land surface and subsurface is temporally downscaled from the long term predictions of the time averaged model using an algorithm dependent on nutrient application timing and hspf simulations of hydrology and sediment the structure is documented in cbp 2020a section 10 the simulations run for the chesapeake bay implementation are forced with hourly values of rainfall snowfall temperature evapotranspiration wind solar radiation dewpoint and cloud cover input data include land use acreage from the cblcm and atmospheric deposition from cmaq as well as bmps fertilizer and manure applications and point source and septic loads to calculate daily flow and associated nutrient and sediment loads 2 3 2 time averaged and dynamic watershed model advantages and limitations the adaptable multi model structure of the watershed model allows the ongoing leveraging of other models and analyses of monitoring data for its improvement the flexible construction is conducive to effective adaptive management which guides better decision making thereby improving environmental results easton et al 2017 the reduced complexity of cast the time averaged version is more understandable to the stakeholder community and has allowed for greater participation in model development moreover the relatively fast run times and web interface for cast allow users to generate their own scenarios or custom reports of previously run scenarios additionally because the cast structure is compiled from multiple sources its use facilitates an uncertainty quantification finally because of the simplified cast structure it is able to take advantage of spatially and temporally dense data sets for water quality measurements and daily load calculations at critical points in the watershed including near the head of tide for major bay tributaries but opportunities for improvement in simulation capacity remain the details of calculation for individual model components can be quite complex and not all of the parameters can be estimated using companion modeling approaches as a result no comprehensive assessment of load prediction uncertainty has been completed particularly with respect to model quantification of load alterations due to anthropogenic changes over time easton et al 2017 demand has increased for better targeting of management practices to improve the effectiveness and lower costs of restoration and with this a need to develop better estimates of nutrient and sediment transport potential at a fine scale easton et al 2020 a related issue is the need to improve targeting of practices that reduce those species of nutrients and sources of sediment with greater efficacy towards water quality load reductions shenk et al 2020 craig et al 2008 filoso et al 2015 model upgrades will be needed to appropriately assess the effect of landscape land use and land management on fine scale delivery and speciation this is particularly true of the sediment simulation approach that requires support from measurements from small headwater streams to large rivers and delivery functions customized to varied landscape settings easton et al 2017 smith et al 2011 noe et al 2020 2 3 3 watershed model summary recommendations 2 3 3 1 general recommendations development of the watershed model components of the cbp modeling system should focus on accurately predicting delivery of nutrients and sediment consistently across spatial scales and properly account for lag times in movement from watershed sources to the bay special attention to scaling issues is necessary to identify water quality problems and management solutions at a site or stream segment scale as well as cumulative impacts on the scale of a river and watershed the watershed models should strive to adopt agile modular designs to facilitate investigation of varied processes and alternative algorithms and to increase transparency for scientists working on diverse aspects of watershed hydrology as well as sediment nitrogen and phosphorus transport and transformation this should include formalisation of rules and procedures for linking modules across spatial and temporal scales modularization will provide greater flexibility and facilitate examination and testing of alternative approaches for quantification and simulation of biophysical processes at lower and higher resolutions and with different levels of mechanistic detail leavesley et al 2002 additionally modular design will facilitate functional expansion of the models to simulate future issues such as the transport and fate of contaminants of emerging concern all data code output and documentation should be made openly available online to enable a community modeling approach to future model development 2 3 3 2 watershed hydrology recommendations improved simulations of chesapeake bay hydrology within the dynamic watershed model would improve predictions of the effects of management actions on nutrient and sediment delivery one area in need of improvement is representation of the hydrologic processes at sub basin scales to better depict the spatial distribution of nutrient and sediment source problems and to generate more finely resolved predictions of pollutant transport within the bay watershed such information would identify areas that if managed sustainably would be most effective to help achieve management and restoration goals veith et al 2003 2004 easton et al 2008 2017 tomer 2018 another area for improvement is the development of a version of the model based on a standard watershed layer appropriate for the scale that management actions are implemented such as the national hydrography dataset nhd or hydrologic unit code huc closer matching between model and management spatial scales would allow for easier conversion and communication of model results to managers over the long term a complementary approach to the basin wide management scale model would be to perform high resolution sub basin scale dynamic simulations in a few select locations that can be used to inform the larger scale management model models operating at scales commensurate with processes occurring on hillslopes and in small headwater streams and capable of resolving fine scale locations of bmp implementation would more accurately quantify headwater inputs into higher order rivers and estuarine tributaries these smaller scale watershed models and the related data assembly can be developed based on regular or irregular mesh grids or can use hydrologic response unit hru based hillslope physiographic district or tributary scale resolution reger and cleaves 2008 cleaves 2003 smith et al 2011 smith and wilcock 2015 amin et al 2017 2018 liu et al 2017 veith et al 2019 williams et al 2015 collick et al 2015 in particular recent developments in watershed reactive transport modeling have advanced forward to couple watershed hydrological processes and land surface interactions with multi component reactions to capture the dynamics of water and biogeochemical interactions including nutrients carbon and sediment transport bao et al 2017 li 2019 zhi et al 2019 a candidate dynamic watershed model that could address many of these limitations and recommendations is the bio reactive transport and flux version of the penn state integrated hydrologic modeling system biort flux pihm zhi and li 2020 in biort flux pihm water flow is dictated by watershed hydrology that is influenced by meteorological conditions and other watershed characteristics domain discretization is fundamental to the approach and an unstructured triangular irregular network e g delaunay triangles is generated with geometric and parametric constraints bhatt et al 2014 fig 12 shows an example of the domain decomposition of mahantango creek watershed into 2606 triangular mesh elements and 509 linear stream elements biort flux pihm couples flow and transport calculations within a full biogeochemical thermodynamic and kinetic framework steefel et al 2015 thereby enabling explicit tracing of spatial and temporal evolution of geochemical species in fluid and solid phases in particular this code has been applied to understanding fine scale nutrient and carbon transformation and transport processes wen et al 2020 zhi and li 2020 these modeling efforts coupled with insights from data have propelled the shallow and deep hypothesis which underscores the essential role of nutrient concentration contrast in shallow soil water and deeper groundwater in shaping stream and river concentration and discharge relationships and therefore loads at different flow regimes zhi and li 2020 these insights combined with river chemistry data can be used to predict nutrient loads with simplified model structure with reduced computational cost and to estimate nutrient removal in groundwater aquifers the use of these reactive transport models however are not limited to nutrients and carbon they can also be used to simulate other water quality parameters including cations salinity and sediments 2 3 3 3 watershed sediment recommendations translating edge of field to edge of stream is difficult due to high variability across the spatial scales watershed location sub regional setting and localized land use resulting in potentially high uncertainty in estimation smith and wilcock 2015 in addition the balance of deposition and erosion in stream reaches is highly variable but critical to sediment budgets noe et al 2020 these issues can be addressed with the creation of new empirical functions through documentation of sediment transport processes and rates for varied sediment grain size classes throughout watershed stream channel networks in varied land use settings better documentation is particularly important in the low order headwater streams that traverse the steepest elevation gradients penetrate the farthest into upland areas and comprise over half of the total channel network length in the bay watershed time lags in sediment movement to the bay highlight the importance of making sure that stakeholders understand that there can be temporal gaps between sediment source management investments and bay water quality outcomes pizzuto 2014 in the short term an updated cbp watershed model could better represent how runoff drainage networks affect sediment sources sinks transport and fate the addition of residence times of sediment located in temporary storage zones would improve predictions of sediment responses to management actions an updated model for watershed sediment simulations would also carry over to improved simulation of constituents e g nutrients associated with sediments and the use of sediment results as input to habitat quality and effects on living resources e g sav oysters local and regional dynamics of erosion followed by the transport deposition remobilization and eventual delivery to the bay are often very important to local communities and stakeholders the spatiotemporal scales of existing empirical and rules based models do not match process based sediment models dietrich et al 2003 in the longer term the formulations related to sediment transport within the watershed model should be refined to better represent the time scales of sediment delivery and thus allow for better assessment of management practices for both the sediments and associated nutrients pizzuto 2014 filoso et al 2015 williams et al 2017 new science and data are needed to fill gaps in our current knowledge of watershed sediment erosion and delivery rates in prominent physiographic settings and under different land use conditions smith and wilcock 2015 noe et al 2020 a cbp sponsored 2017 legacy sediments workshop identified knowledge gaps and how they could be addressed miller et al 2019a to build on this effort the cbp partnership would benefit from the establishment of a sediment modeling workgroup with expertise in geomorphology and with stakeholder representation to engage in both long term and short term knowledge co generation and strategies to improve the representation of sediment dynamics in the cbp watershed model smith et al 2011 it is anticipated that it could take a decade or more for full development including new data collection and implementation i e calibration validation of a revised sediment transport formulation in the watershed model 2 3 3 4 watershed nutrient recommendations the time averaged version of the nutrient watershed model should be enhanced to become more spatially explicit and mass conserving an enhanced version of the time averaged model could be fit to the fluxes estimated from monitoring data as it is done with the sparrow model e g ator and garcia 2016 and be informed by ensemble predictions of the model component coefficients in a similar manner to the 2017 time averaged model this new version would allow for investigation of the watershed effects of bmp performance including localized effects and interactions with the effects of climate change craig et al 2008 filoso and palmer 2011 a spatially explicit version would also allow for better quantification of nutrient sources and sinks that depend on the spatial arrangement of riparian and wetland areas weller and baker 2014 and improved representation of hydrologic connectivity to identify critical source areas that contribute disproportionately to loads that could then be targeted by management wallace et al 2018 finally this new version would offer the opportunity to quantify nutrient legacy effects revisit riverine biogeochemical processes especially in active channels and floodplains and to incorporate new sources of high resolution data on land use and geomorphology to better represent variability in nutrient retention in forest types and forest seral stages over time and under elevated atmospheric co2 craine et al 2018 for both the time averaged and dynamic watershed models the nutrient forms and species simulated should be evaluated to ensure they can be easily matched to the forms in the estuarine biogeochemical model for example partitioning nutrients into particulate and dissolved phases in the watershed models would improve connectivity with the estuarine model e g dari et al 2018 reactivity might also be considered since effective targeting of management will require implementing practices that reduce the reactive constituents e g liu et al 2018 miller et al 2019b lags related to nitrogen delivery require expanded considerations of groundwater flow pathways and new approaches to quantify travel times and removal rates within drainage networks sanford and pope 2013 phillips and lindsey 2003 specification of delivery processes under varied settings and conditions will be necessary requiring expanded forms of measurement in each of the prominent physiographic settings in the chesapeake bay watershed for example an approach that relates nutrient delivery potential to a measurement such as a topographic wetness index or connectivity index could take advantage of recent increases in land use and elevation measurement scales temporally and spatially dense sensor arrays in low order streams would allow for development and validation of such approaches easton et al 2020 addition of organic carbon to the watershed models is also warranted both to force estuarine biogeochemical models and allow more accurate representation of watershed loads of oxygen demanding material in the present versions of the watershed models carbon loads are derived from the simulated nutrient and sediment loads implementing these recommendations will improve the watershed models ability to identify critical source areas especially those in hydrologically active and connected zones and allow for smooth coupling to other models implementing these recommendations will require re analyses of existing data and collection of additional data e g ator et al 2020 specifically nitrogen speciation sources and sinks will need to be characterized particularly in low order streams leveraging existing data will involve extensive data gathering and the development of new data analysis strategies for using relatively short time series to determine spatial and temporal variability new data in previously unmonitored areas small streams and directly discharging groundwater should be collected to fill important gaps field scale nutrient flux data should be collected relative to field conditions and landscape position to better identify and manage critical source areas buda et al 2009 buda 2013 2013 2 4 estuarine hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry models 2 4 1 overview of the 2017 estuarine hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry models the estuarine model is composed of two independent models a hydrodynamic model computes transport information which is stored offline for repeated use by a biogeochemical model the biogeochemical model is the decision model for projected attainment of tidal bay dissolved oxygen chlorophyll and water clarity standards under tmdl scenarios 2 4 1 1 estuarine hydrodynamic model the estuarine hydrodynamic model curvilinear hydrodynamics in 3 dimensions or ch3d is based on a model originally developed by sheng 1986 that was modified extensively for application to the chesapeake bay johnson et al 1991 kim 2013 the hydrodynamic model is forced by tides wind freshwater inflow and heat exchange at the water surface tides are based on observations recorded near the mouth of the bay noaa tides and currents https tidesandcurrents noaa gov wind and heat exchange are obtained from local meteorological observations noaa national center for environmental information https www ncdc noaa gov cdo web datasets ghcnd locations city us240002 detail salinity and temperature fields are prescribed on the open boundary outside the bay mouth based on observations chesapeake bay program water quality database https www chesapeakebay net what downloads cbp water quality database 1984 present daily freshwater inflow from rivers diffuse coastal plain surface flows and groundwater flows are all prescribed using output from the dynamic 2017 watershed model the ch3d model then calculates time dependent variations in salinity temperature water level elevation velocity and turbulent diffusivity in three dimensions with a 90 second time step there are up to 19 layers in the vertical dimension with a uniform layer thickness of 1 52 m except that the top layer thickness fluctuates with sea level the surface layer is 2 14 m thick at mean tide horizontally the governing equations in the cartesian coordinate system are recast in a boundary fitted curvilinear coordinate system to cope with the irregular shoreline configuration and deep channel orientation in the present chesapeake bay configuration there are 11 064 surface cells and 56 920 total cells with an average grid cell dimension of 1025 1025 m fig 13 2 4 1 2 estuarine biogeochemical model the velocity and diffusivity outputs from the ch3d hydrodynamic model along with nutrient and sediment loads prescribed by the dynamic 2017 watershed model are used to force a finite volume biogeochemical model corps of engineers integrated compartment water quality model abbreviated as ce qual icm or simply icm cerco and cole 1993 cerco and noel 2013 the icm model uses the same grid as ch3d and is forced with hourly transport from ch3d daily loads from the watershed model and monthly boundary concentrations of all state variables at the mouth of the bay the time step is determined dynamically based on computational stability requirements and is 15 min on average icm incorporates 24 state variables that include physical variables salinity temperature fixed solids three groups of phytoplankton dissolved oxygen and multiple forms of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus fig 14 salinity is computed by solving the three dimensional mass conservation equation for a conservative substance computation of temperature however includes atmospheric heat exchange at the water surface evaluated following edinger et al 1974 salinity and temperature are computed in the biogeochemical model to provide quality assurance of the linkage to the hydrodynamic model when forced by the same boundary conditions and surface heat flux salinity and temperature computed in the biogeochemical model should be identical to the hydrodynamic model dortch et al 1992 organic carbon undergoes numerous transformations in the water column the model carbon cycle fig 14 is defined in this context around the process of eutrophication nixon 1995 and consists of the following elements phytoplankton production and excretion predation on phytoplankton dissolution of particulate carbon heterotrophic respiration and settling cerco 2000 algal production is the primary autochthonous organic carbon source to the water column cerco and noel 2004 although carbon also enters the system through external loading brookfield et al 2021 predation on algae releases particulate and dissolved organic carbon to the water column a fraction of the particulate organic carbon undergoes first order dissolution to dissolved organic carbon dissolved organic carbon produced by excretion predation and dissolution is respired at a first order rate to inorganic carbon particulate organic carbon that does not undergo dissolution settles to the bottom sediments the model nitrogen cycle fig 14 includes the following processes algal uptake and metabolism predation hydrolysis of particulate organic nitrogen mineralization of dissolved organic nitrogen settling and nitrification external loads provide the ultimate source of nitrogen to the system available nitrogen is incorporated by algae during growth and released as ammonium and organic nitrogen through respiration and predation a portion of the particulate organic nitrogen hydrolyzes to dissolved organic nitrogen the balance settles to the sediments dissolved organic nitrogen is mineralized to ammonium in an oxygenated water column a fraction of the ammonium is subsequently oxidized to nitrate nitrite through nitrification particulate nitrogen which settles to the sediments is mineralized and recycled to the water column primarily as ammonium nitrate and nitrite move in both directions across the sediment water interface depending on relative concentrations in the water column and sediment porewater the model phosphorus cycle fig 14 includes the following processes algal uptake and metabolism predation hydrolysis of particulate organic phosphorus mineralization of dissolved organic phosphorus dissolution of particulate inorganic phosphorus and settling and resuspension external loads provide the ultimate source of phosphorus to the system dissolved phosphate is incorporated by algae during growth and released as phosphate and organic phosphorus through respiration and predation dissolved organic phosphorus is mineralized to phosphate a portion of the particulate organic phosphorus hydrolyzes to dissolved organic phosphorus the balance settles to the sediments dissolution of particulate inorganic phosphorus is also possible within the sediments particulate organic phosphorus is mineralized and recycled to the water column as dissolved phosphate in the model carbon nitrogen and phosphorus cycles three classes of particulate constituents are considered labile refractory and slow refractory corresponding to classes utilized in the benthic sediment diagenesis model icm includes a benthic diagenesis submodel for calculating sediment oxygen demand and sediment water nutrient flux and a sediment transport submodel for calculating sediment loading deposition erosion and transport which considers four solids size classes cerco et al 2010 cerco and noel 2013 bottom shear stress for computing erosion and deposition is a combination of stress generated by currents and surface waves harris et al 2013 a multi level bed framework tracks the distribution of each size class in each layer and stores bulk properties including layer thickness porosity and mass warner et al 2008b an sav model calculates the water clarity sav standard for the restoration of sav and accounts for positive feedbacks that improve water clarity cerco and moore 2001 a model of benthic filter feeders three filter feeder groups accounts for the effects of filtration on water quality and clarity the sediment diagenesis submodel fig 15 based on ditoro 2001 see also brady et al 2013 and clark et al 2017 is coupled to icm to account for the response of sediment water nutrient and oxygen exchanges to management actions in the watershed the spatial and computational time scales of the sediment diagenesis model are the same as the water quality model the diagenesis model considers a 10 cm thick active sediment layer that incorporates an aerobic surface layer with the remaining depth considered anaerobic the thickness of the surface aerobic layer is time variable and is calculated based on overlying water column oxygen concentration and model calculated sediment oxygen demand the aerobic first layer is much thinner than the anoxic second layer 1 2 mm vs 10 cm in the anoxic layer diagenesis of organic matter nitrogen phosphorus and carbon creates ammonium phosphate and oxygen demand respectively the fate of these substances i e release to water column release to atmosphere burial is determined by processes including nitrification denitrification sulfate reduction and methanogenesis ten years of model spin up are required to equilibrate new scenario loads with burial and refractory diagenetic processes 2 4 2 estuarine model advantages and limitations the ch3d icm combination provides computations of estuarine transport processes and water quality in three dimensions on spatial scales of meters vertical to kilometers horizontal and lateral and on an intra tidal time scale the grid is based on quadrilateral elements in the horizontal lateral plane ch3d is distinctive however in the use of non orthogonal curvilinear coordinates the non orthogonal representation implies that the grid elements are not required to meet at right angles as in models which employ orthogonal curvilinear coordinates the non orthogonal coordinate system allows improved representation of complicated channel geometry and irregular shorelines the computational grid employs a z grid representation in the vertical axis in the z grid variations in depth are represented by varying the number of cells in the vertical direction the cells are of constant thickness except for the surface cell which varies according to meteorological and tidal forcing the z grid avoids the artificial vertical mixing which is associated with sigma coordinate systems constant number of vertical cells which vary in thickness throughout the artificial mixing associated with a sigma grid was noted early in the model application and was avoided to compute bottom water anoxia in the bay channel perhaps the greatest advantage of the eutrophication component is the use of organic carbon throughout the model kinetics representations traditional water quality models were often based on alternate quantities such as biochemical oxygen demand bod or organic matter phytoplankton was quantified as chlorophyll rather than as carbon biomass as in the present model the carbon based kinetics maximize the use of current rigorous observations in the model calibration and verification and avoid the need to define quantities such as bod to chlorophyll ratio one rationale for the use of organic carbon is to make the water column kinetics consistent with the carbon based sediment diagenesis model the model is also distinctive in that the labile refractory and slow refractory carbon nitrogen and phosphorus variables in the diagenesis model have direct corresponding state variables in the water column the definition of direct corresponding state variables avoids the need to define empirical relationships between detailed representation in the sediments i e three reaction classes and less detailed representation in the water column e g total organic carbon the phytoplankton kinetics in the model cerco and noel 2004 are distinctive in that they employ to the greatest extent possible quantities currently measured in field and laboratory investigations growth is related to maximum photosynthetic rate g c g 1 chl d 1 rather than a specified daily average growth rate production is related to light via the jassby and platt 1976 relationship and is based on photosynthetically active radiation μmole photons m 2 s 1 rather than thermal units such as langleys the model has been rigorously calibrated to observed photosynthetic rates and primary production cerco and noel 2004 however as the modeling effort developed and additional capabilities were added to the ch3d icm combination some disadvantages of the grid configuration became apparent the grid went through several refinements which improved resolution in the horizontal lateral plane inevitably the limitations of representing complicated shoreline configuration with quadrilaterals emerged an unstructured grid that employs triangular elements could be a better approach the z grid represents changes in depth by varying the number of cells in the vertical when changes in depth are steep the variation in number of cells can become dramatic resembling a stairstep or even a wall this can create problems for example computing the turbidity maximum at the head of the bay using the sediment transport module is impeded by the sharp variation in number of cells at the head of the bay channel sediment moving upstream cannot climb the stairs at the head of the channel a smoothly sloping bottom would improve computation of upstream sediment transport although care must be taken not to adversely affect the representation of stratification associated with a sigma grid another problem arises when using the model in the shallow upper reaches of tributaries in such regions the model may have only one or two depth levels and hence be unable to reproduce the estuarine circulation required to effectively model salinity in the shallows in addition the outer boundary of the physical model is currently located at the bay mouth a region of sharp changes in topography and strong currents this is not ideal moving the outer boundary offshore to the continental shelf away from the mainstem bay would among other things improve simulations of future impacts of sea level rise on chesapeake bay finally the lack of coastal wetting and drying in the current model does not allow for consideration of impacts from sea level rise inundation of the coastline and its wetlands the eutrophication component incorporates representation of several living resource components including submerged aquatic vegetation sav and bivalve filter feeding organisms living resources are included based on their value to management or their necessity to the model for example correct representation of the spatial distribution of phytoplankton is impossible without incorporating the effects of filter feeders the living resource components are based on mass balance relationships a disadvantage is that the complete detailed life cycles of the living resources are not represented the simplification of the life cycles compromises the model s ability to represent the spatial and temporal distribution of the resources for example the distribution of sav is largely based on light availability while the influence of light on sav distribution is well established the distribution of sav is also influenced by recruitment and propagation which are not considered in the model the distribution of bivalves is also strongly influenced by recruitment since living resources are not the primary focus of the model the additional calibration and computational resources required for more realistic representations may not be necessary however the limitations of the current representations must be recognized creation of specific dedicated living resource models may be a superior alternative to adding complexities to the present models 2 4 3 estuarine model summary recommendations short term and long term efforts should continue the present trend of resolving finer spatial scales to make the estuarine models more directly applicable to assessing the performance of management actions at scales relevant to local communities and stakeholders prediction of locally relevant restoration outcomes may also prove a powerful incentive to motivate further investment and implementation application to smaller scales requires that the models have sufficient resolution to resolve tidal tributaries and relatively fast changes in biogeochemistry such as diel cycling hypoxia tyler et al 2009 however refining spatial scale and increasing parameters have costs in computational time development effort data requirements and parameter uncertainty some regions of the chesapeake bay may not benefit from further increases in spatial and temporal resolution and so careful consideration should be given to determining exactly where higher resolution is needed multiple approaches for improving representation at local scales are available for consideration including unstructured or nested horizontal grids the term unstructured refers to grids composed of triangles tetrahedra or irregularly shaped elements an unstructured hybrid grid with hybrid referring to grids that combine multiple types of vertical and or horizontal grid structures would be a good candidate approach because it allows for inclusion of local scale processes while maintaining efficient use of computational resources schism semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model zhang et al 2015 2016 ye et al 2018 is an example of an unstructured model fig 16 that provides advantages over the current cbp hydrodynamic model ch3d schism is an open source community supported modeling system based on hybrid triangular quadrangular unstructured grids designed for seamless simulation of 3d baroclinic circulation across creek lake river estuary shelf ocean scales it uses a highly efficient and accurate semi implicit hybrid finite element finite volume method with a eulerian lagrangian algorithm to solve the navier stokes equations in hydrostatic form to address a wide range of physical and biogeochemical processes the number of vertical layers can also be varied spatially zhang et al 2015 and thus a single schism grid can seamlessly morph between 1d 2d 3d configurations model polymorphism zhang et al 2016 the use of shaved cells i e cells that have a sloped bottom and avoid the staircase effects associated with z coordinates near the bottom not only captures the underlying bathymetry topography but also greatly improves model accuracy for bottom controlled processes such as salt intrusion and gravity overflow ye et al 2018 in addition two way online coupling rather than one way offline between the hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models is critical for enabling investigation of how biogeochemical and biological processes affect physical processes for example increased particulates in the water column will impact estuarine bottom temperature via light attenuation kim et al 2020 and sav can impact water velocities such feedbacks of the biogeochemistry on the physical fields may be important in setting local tmdls a second recommendation also longer term is to implement a modular experimental simulation framework that allows for testing of new and alternative biogeochemical formulations this would allow investigation of additional processes and alternative formulations to increase certainty in the results provided to management based on the foundational version of the coupled modeling system such a framework or testbed approach would also expand the engagement of the cbp modeling system with academic and government research communities which would facilitate incorporation of latest scientific advancements such inter model comparison approaches have been successfully performed that include the cbp estuarine model irby et al 2016 irby and friedrichs 2019 and in a comparison of shallow water models in the chester river of the bay friedrichs et al unpublished these collaborative groups of modeling teams were more effective than individual efforts in advancing the models in large part because of the balance between the teams working separately while also meeting on a regular basis to share their findings and insights a similar collaborative approach is recommended for the next generation model of the chesapeake bay estuary finally the 2014 agreement has focused attention on the prediction of management actions on living resources and thus it will be important to put more formal effort into the identification of specific types of products from the hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models that can inform living resource models the cbp partnership will benefit from the enhancement of the working relationship between hydrodynamic biogeochemical and living resource modeling groups because of the ecological economic and societal relevance of linking the chesapeake bay tmdl to living resources 2 5 estuarine living resource models 2 5 1 overview of the 2017 estuarine living resource models as discussed above the cbp modeling system includes simple sub models for sav and benthic filter feeders that are coupled to the estuarine hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry models designed with water quality effects in mind two additional living resource models chesapeake bay fisheries ecosystem management model cbfem and chesapeake bay atlantis model cam have been developed by the ncbo to support chesapeake bay restoration but these are not official components of the cbp coupled modeling system the cbfem is an implementation of ecopath with ecosim christensen et al 2009 it uses the biomass estimations of 45 trophic groups representing fisheries species of interest to the bay and their prey and predators table 2 to create a mass balanced snapshot of the trophic linkages in the bay as it may have been in 1950 townsend 2014 the 45 trophic groups include species of commercial and ecological importance represented by either single stocks sub stocks or species groups that occupy similar foraging niches as is typical for ecopath with ecosim applications the ecopath snapshot provides the base model for time dependent ecosim simulations the cbfem ecosim model simulates the annual mean biomass values of the aforementioned species and groups for 53 years 1950 2002 to provide an assessment of the recent decadal dynamics of the bay s fish species townsend 2014 the cbfem ecosim simulations have been loosely coupled to the cbp water quality model icm by forcing it with time dependent chlorophyll a townsend 2014 and sav ma et al 2010 output to assess how water quality management strategies affect living resources for the chlorophyll a application the model was used to simulate the impacts of a 40 reduction of nutrient inputs on upper trophic level species e g the biomass of striped bass and blue crabs and other commercially important fished species e g atlantic menhaden and eastern oysters townsend 2014 these simulations allow connections to be made between water quality and commercially and recreationally important species and they can be used to assess trade offs between water quality management goals and fisheries management goals the chesapeake bay atlantis model cam is in contrast to cbfem a spatially explicit three dimensional full system biogeochemical physical and trophic simulation model ihde et al 2016 ihde and townsend 2017 the cam domain is composed of 97 irregular polygons and includes the brackish waters and sediments of the mainstem chesapeake bay and eight of its largest tributaries fig 17 water movement in cam is driven by the navy coastal ocean model ncom relocatable model nutrient and sediment loads to the model are derived from the cbp dynamic watershed phase 5 3 2 model shenk and linker 2013 cam includes 26 invertebrate functional groups including primary producers and multiple bacterial groups and 29 vertebrate groups most invertebrates are modeled as single state variables mg n m 3 but two invertebrate groups blue crab and brief squid are modeled as linked juvenile and adult state variables all vertebrate groups are divided into 10 age classes each tracked by abundance and weight at age cam uses nitrogen as the currency for all state variables metabolic waste and decaying organisms form multiple forms of detritus that are cycled through bacteria to provide nutrients for both planktonic and benthic floral growth habitat types in cam include both static physical factors such as mud sand rock and woody debris and dynamic biogenic functional groups such as marsh sav and oyster reef that provide refuge for prey from predator groups fish and other animal groups are assigned a dependence to one or more of the seven habitat types and at least one such habitat must be available in a box for biomass of a group to move into that box cam has been used to estimate the higher trophic level impacts of fully achieving the goals of the u s epa tmdl requirements under present day climate conditions and warmer water temperatures habitat loss and water quality restoration tmdl under assumed future climate conditions fig 18 ihde et al 2016 ihde and townsend 2017 these simulations used nutrient and sediment loads derived from the cbp s phase 5 3 2 watershed model fig 19 ihde et al 2016 the cam and the cbfem have not been directly coupled to the cbp estuarine hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models indeed the cam overlaps the functionality of the icm because atlantis is built on its own biogeochemical model murray and parslow 1999 2 5 2 estuarine living resource models advantages and limitations estuarine living resource models are needed to estimate ecosystem status and predict the impacts of anthropogenically induced changes to forcing conditions on higher trophic level species most notably the tmdl mandated nutrient loads and altered climate unlike more targeted living resource models that simulate individual species or just a few species these ecosystem models put the population dynamics of modeled groups in the context of the entire ecosystem with predators prey and competitors providing a mechanism for achieving the larger goal of ecosystem based management simpler approaches like cbfem mainly focus on trophic factors whereas more complex approaches like cam also include the dominant physical and biogeochemical forcings the cbfem produces a mass balanced state of the ecosystem which is then used to simulate the system over time in response management actions in contrast cam is designed to estimate cumulative effects of multiple factors acting simultaneously on the system the structure of cam is spatially explicit and it is much more complex than cbfem as a result the cam model is computationally expensive and simulations can take days in comparison ecopath with ecosim produces model estimates in seconds to minutes because the cbfem and cam models integrate a variety of different data from an array of sources model estimates carry the burden of uncertainty inherent in each of those sources as a result the uncertainty of the model outputs is very large thus the cbfem and cam models are not at present applied to tactical tasks like setting fishery harvest limits instead they could be used to supplement tactical models providing contextual information such as potential ecosystem impacts and trade offs for a range of different management options to refine decision making finally it should be noted that the cbfem and cam model simulations are constrained to reflect the characteristics of the observed system yet ultimately these models may be needed to predict the future on timescales of multiple decades or more in response to future forcing conditions that have not been observed in the past thus adding even more uncertainty to the model predictions 2 5 3 estuarine living resource models summary recommendations efforts to further incorporate living resources into the cbp modeling system predictions could start with the development of additional models like cbfem and cam that use cbp model output to drive higher trophic level models in the short term outputs can be used to estimate responses to habitat changes of key species in response to management actions the current sav model in icm responds to water clarity however other factors also influence sav growth such as propagation processes and the physical characteristics of the bottom substrate these additional influences could be added to the icm model to more realistically simulate sav growth and bed expansion in response to restoration efforts and improved water clarity in the bay similar expansions to the existing formulation can be implemented for benthic filter feeders within the icm newell et al 2002 harding and mann 2001 north et al 2010 to increase their realism and include more feedbacks this approach has been used for fish population dynamics in chesapeake bay for both menhaden dalyander and cerco 2010 and bay anchovy adamack et al 2017 both efforts used an agent based lagrangian approach to simulate population dynamics but eulerian based approaches could also be implemented another short term approach is to process the output of the estuarine models to assess habitat suitability of key species for example the effect of temperature and oxygen on striped bass fig 20 habitat suitability is widely used to inform management on how altered environmental conditions will affect habitat quantity and quality e g secor et al 2009 brown et al 2013 a new generation of these habitat models such as species distribution models niche modeling and bioclimatic models are now being widely applied guisan and thuiller 2005 ehrlén and morris 2015 crear et al 2020a b models of higher trophic level habitat that use estuarine model output could be modular so that they can be easily interchangeable and allow for direct comparisons of responses across species further adapting and integrating one or both of the existing food web models with the estuarine models is another relatively short term approach the feasibility of trying to extract the higher trophic level formulations from cam and loosely or tightly couple them to ch3d and icm is an open question one role that may be important for cam is to function as a companion model to icm to address many of the goals and outcomes of the 2014 agreement that relate to higher trophic level species that are not simulated by icm in addition or alternatively the cbfem could be developed further into a spatially explicit ecospace model which would allow for loose coupling to ch3d icm as ecospace does not contain its own physical or biogeochemical model making use of the habitat capacity model within ecospace christensen et al 2014 would allow for using ch3d and icm output as environmental drivers affecting the biomass and spatial distribution of estuarine living resources comparing an ecospace version of cbfem with cam would then provide a multiple model approach for higher trophic levels lewis et al 2021 issues related to commercial and recreational fish abundances food web energetics e g pelagic versus benthic pathways system resilience and human interactions could be quantified to allow for comprehensive assessment of the costs benefits and tradeoffs of different management strategies e g wainger et al 2013 a technical challenge to the incorporation of living resources within the cbp modeling system is how to couple the models to the watershed and estuarine models ganju et al 2016 the living resources models have different temporal and spatial scales compared to the cbp watershed and estuarine models an investment in protocols and software for coupling models warner et al 2008a koralewski et al 2019 will ensure consistency in the results across the living resource models that will aid in interpretation and comparisons across species and food webs creating these protocols in the co production framework of the cbp will also serve to build the same transparency and trust that is already in place for the airshed watershed land use hydrodynamic and estuarine models the cbp partnership would benefit from the establishment an ecosystem modeling subcommittee responsible for both tidal and nontidal aquatic systems the collection of examples and food web models along with other living resource models developed outside of the cbp and fisheries management models can serve as prototypes for a more comprehensive analysis of water quality effects on chesapeake bay living resources the subcommittee should adopt a portfolio of modeling approaches for living resources that includes agreed upon protocols for 1 analyzing output from the cbp modeling system from a habitat organism perspective 2 translating cbp modeling system output to develop habitat or growth suitability indices 3 using cbp modeling system output as input for living resource and higher trophic level models and 4 integrating organisms into the icm water quality model as has been done for example with benthic filter feeders and sav an explicit strategy for further incorporating living resources into the modeling system would encourage effective and efficient progress as a starting point the subcommittee could consider nonlinear responses of living resources to nutrients and sediment new approaches and purposes for modeling primary producers that include botanical processes and re integrating consumers into the icm biogeochemical model to facilitate coupling to higher trophic levels e g zooplankton which is not explicitly included in the icm model the subcommittee could also articulate mechanisms for communication and stakeholder involvement emphasizing that modeling living resource responses allows communication of co benefits of restoration to stakeholders 3 lessons learned the cbp modeling system has contributed to several management successes that are due in large part to broad acceptance of the models by the scientific management and stakeholder communities this acceptance is the result of several factors first the members and participants of the modeling workgroup adhere to a set of core values that have promoted 1 integration of the most recent airshed watershed and estuarine research and knowledge to support modeling for restoration decision making 2 innovating embracing creativity and encouraging improvement in the development and support of transparent and robust modeling tools 3 independence in making modeling decisions on the basis of best available evidence and using the most appropriate methods to produce run and interpret models independent of policy considerations and 4 inclusiveness with a strong commitment to an open and transparent process and the engagement of relevant partners that results in strengthening the cbp s decision making tools adherence to these values for more than three decades has resulted in a buildup of trust among scientific management and stakeholder communities in addition the cbp models have always been developed in phases for example phase 6 of the watershed model development was completed in 2017 and the cbp is now working on the next generation of models for the 2025 assessment now designated as phase 7 the use of phases has several advantages it provides a subtle reminder to scientists and managers that the cbp models are continually evolving it also reminds scientists and managers of their approval of the previous modeling phase which facilitates approval of new models that are refined and improved versions of the previous model phase in addition the cbp partners and collaborators understand that whatever the current model phase it too will be further refined and the known current model limitations will be addressed going forward in the ongoing evolution of the cbp models the formal procedures for model partnership development and approval are supported by cbp s longstanding commitment to being deeply collaborative with a transparent approach to open source model development and application another approach used by the cbp scientific community to increase cbp model transparency and access is convening technical transfer workshops on the models and tools to increase understanding and promote wide use the cbp has also used its web sites and on line documentation to create an extensive public record of what has been agreed to in cbp model development including specifics of all major decisions and public access to the supporting technical material 4 summary and going forward the cbp partnership has used its linked modeling system as a planning tool to inform strategic management decisions toward bay restoration since the 1980s over the last decade the modeling system has been used to formulate the 2010 chesapeake bay tmdl evaluate progress and make midcourse adjustment in 2017 and inform the states and dc s development of three phases of watershed implementation plans that detail actions to be taken to reduce nutrients and sediment although model development has been driven by regulatory management needs the development process is built on a foundation of monitoring research and collaborative engagement that cultivates the understanding necessary to manage water quality and habitat conditions in the chesapeake bay and its watershed given past successes in the cbp modeling system there is ample evidence that new modeling tools will continue to be developed and incorporated into the modeling system to assist managers in setting communicating and achieving future tmdls under uncertain future conditions influenced by varied scenarios of bmp implementation land use and climate change envisioning the future of the cbp modeling system is timely there have been recent advances in physical and biogeochemical process understanding computer science and environmental systems modeling approaches and techniques the upcoming 2025 assessment offers an opportunity to continue this process through the use of improved models this paper provides an overview of the 2017 cbp management modeling system and presents recommendations on potential improvements for 2025 and beyond these improved models would better support and inform watershed management of nutrients and sediment for water quality goals and be an important step toward explicitly assessing management actions on living resources the recommendations are summarized for the various component models in tables 3 4 and 5 tables 3 and 4 represent the airshed land use and watershed models by short term table 3 and long term table 4 the recommendations for the remaining estuarine and living resources models are summarized in table 5 without separation by time frame but still with the order proceeding as presented in the paper which roughly places shorter term recommendations first four major themes in the recommendations that apply to all the models are the need for 1 finer spatial resolution 2 improved connectivity and coupling of the component models and 3 estimation of uncertainty modeling at higher and or variable resolution would improve input to local watershed tmdls and watershed implementation plans including fine scale atmosphere land use and watershed modeling capability this starts with the need for better representation of watershed delivery mechanisms for surface water nutrients and sediment as well as the changes to delivery patterns due to bmp implementation while the models within the modeling system are linked more explicit representation of the connectivity and coupling among the models would enhance their usability and interpretability this includes how information is transferred among models and the adoption of modular approaches there is an equally imperative demand for better simulations of the many linkages between water quality and living resources in the bay to predict the effects of attainment of nutrient reduction goals on living resources and to create opportunities to understand and leverage co benefits associated with restoration models that more fully represent higher trophic levels and ecosystem dynamics and feedbacks could provide a more complete picture of whether the conditions that support desirable living resource outcomes are being achieved many of the recommendations involve adding resolution or expanding aspects of the models and therefore have costs in computational time development effort data requirements and parameter uncertainty some regions of the model domains may not benefit from further increases in resolution and so careful consideration should be given to determining where higher resolution will result in substantial management benefits these models must be flexible and computationally efficient to enable scenario analysis with multiple runs ensembles to create probabilities of outcomes under different conditions efforts aimed at characterizing the uncertainty in the cbp partnership model projections e g irby and friedrichs 2019 should continue in addition to independent verification and sensitivity testing to understand model skill many recommendations involved attempts to increase the confidence in model predictions often by increasing resolution and by implementing more complicated process representations formal uncertainty analysis of large coupled modeling systems is a challenge allen et al 2007 pianosi et al 2016 razavi and gupta 2015 a useful exercise is to also look for opportunities to simplify processes and formulations within the models and to consider computational aspects to ensure simulations can be performed on the schedule needed by management decision making another direction to move forward is to integrate data driven and process based models karpatne et al 2017 reichstein et al 2019 shen 2018 taking advantage of the strength of both models as outlined in this paper process based models can offer process based scientific insights and cause consequence relationships machine learning techniques on the other hand can learn from data to facilitate the parameterization of process based models and reduce model uncertainty in particular in recent years deep learning approaches have gained momentum in hydrological forecasting fang et al 2019 rahmani et al 2021 shen 2018 a recent study has also shown the promise of training a deep learning model long short term memory lstm at the continental scale using largely available hydrometeorology data to forecast dissolved oxygen do an important water quality measure zhi et al 2021 the model learned the theory of do dependence on water temperature it also indicated the critical needs of data collection under conditions that lead to do peaks and troughs further data driven model development can potentially lead to insights of temporal trends and spatial patterns that can advance hydro biogeochemical theories and forecasting capabilities for water quality response to changing climate and human perturbations the development of the coupled modeling system and its use to inform management was and will continue to be a long term process and investment the cbp partnership will benefit from continuing its efforts to increase stakeholder engagement to create a shared vision of effective restoration strategies and to help guide model development and application linkages to the scientific community are also important to maintain the pressure of peer review so the models are up to date the trust accumulated to date must be maintained into the future as recommendations are considered and implemented
