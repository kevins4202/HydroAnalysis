connection uncertain wave adaptive estimator sequential quadratic programming 1 introduction for the utilization of ocean space and the development of ocean resources very large floating structures vlfs have been concerned in ocean and costal engineering as early as 1920s large scale floating structures were proposed as airplane supply and navigation station in the atlantic ocean armstrong 1924 until 1980s large numbers of architects city planners and engineers have been devoted to the field of vlfs in the course of vlfs development two renowned projects significantly promoted the researches of vlfs one is the megafloat project suzuki 2005 sponsored by japanese government another is the project of mobile offshore base mob bhattacharya et al 2001 suzuki 2017 funded by the us navy the megafloat project led to a pontoon type floating airport built and tested in tokyo bay in 1999 which is the only floating airport constructed in human history shuku et al 2001 since the scale of a vlfs is about few thousand meters the pontoon structure cannot withstand huge bending loads mob is a type of modularized floating airport which usually consists of a number of connected floating modules ohmatsu 2005 wang and tay 2011 although mob overcomes the weakness of pontoon structures the connection technology of modules has been challenging there are few kinds of proposed connectors such as flexible connector gao et al 2013 hinged connector wu 1996 dynamic positioning method sørensen et al 1996 etc due to the release of some degree of freedom by using connectors large movement of floating modules has been seriously concerned for modularized floating structures because it deteriorates operation conditions and seriously affects the service life and maintenance cost motion mitigation is a critical issue for modularized floating structures but there has been not much literature on it for the stability control of multi modular floating structures a semi active scheme xia et al 2016 was proposed by using tunable air spring connectors on the basis of the amplitude death mechanism dynamic position dp system sørensen 2011 uses thrusters propellers to drive a marine vehicle towards the designated position or follow a default route note that dp is a kind of positioning technique rather than resolving vibration problems of a floating structure nevertheless dp system s thrust control algorithms balchen et al 1980 power distribution methods veksler et al 2016 experimental studies fossen and grovlen 1998 etc can be a good reference to develop vibration control technology for floating structures for vibration control xia etc proposed a backstepping method to suppress motions of modules under uncertain sea conditions xia et al 2019 in marine engineering there are some other relevant works on specific single direction motion control such as the heave motion reduction of a multi spar floating platform li et al 2013 suppression of the pitch motion of spar type floating structure ha and cheong 2016 the pitch motion reduction of a rectangular box floating structure yin 2017 generally speaking there are few researches on the motion suppression of modular floating structures in this paper a control scheme is proposed in conjunction with hinge connection to suppress motions of multi modular floating systems in uncertain sea conditions based on the principle of simplicity and practicality the use of hinge connectors is put forward for the control and the hinge connectors can perfectly constrain the relative motions of surge sway and yaw between connected modules therefore only the motions of heave roll and pitch need to be simply dealt with in control to suppress these three types of motions only thrusts in vertical direction are required so that it leads to a great simplification in the thruster deployment and the control scheme although there is no control in surge sway and yaw the whole rigid floating system only has much smaller drifting motions in comparing with other three motions in the study the floating structure consists of a number of semi submersible modules connected by the hinged connectors the arrangement of thrusters underneath a semi submersible module will be elaborated because of the complexity structure of the modularized semi submersible module the forces vectors of waves and connectors acting on the floating structure will be considered as unknown load a neural network scheme is used for the estimation of uncertain load referred to radial basis function neural network rbfnn it can fit any time varying function simply and conveniently chen et al 1991 in this paper an adaptive rbfnn method is developed to estimate the wave and connector forces imposed on the floating structure to suppress the heave roll and pitch motions of the modular floating structure the proportional derivative pd algorithm is employed in conjunction with the rbfnn estimator liu 2018 in order to distribute the control output reasonably an optimization method of sequential quadratic programming sqp nocedal and wright 2006 is used with the goal of the minimum energy consumption to determine the control thrusts from propellers with output saturation constraint the novelty of this paper is to put forward the idea using hinge connection in a control scheme in comparison with the previous works xia et al 2019 2016 this idea enables one to only concern few motion controls in heave roll and pitch it greatly simplifies the arrangement of thrusters and the control scheme so that one can realize the design concept of using as fewer thrusters as possible and control as more motions as possible of course the idea also can save a great deal of investment in engineering applications because of the simple layout this paper is organized as follow in the next section the mathematical model of the multi modular floating structure with vertical propellers is derived then the control process is derived to get the thrusts of the propellers afterwards numerical simulations are given to verify the effectiveness of the control method at last a conclusion is drawn 2 mathematical model of modularized floating structure with propellers as shown in fig 1 the modularized floating structure consists of n semi submersible modules which are connected by hinged connectors between two adjacent modules two hinged connectors are mounted an anchor chain is installed on each module to prevent the whole floating structure from drifting global coordinate system x y z is set of which x y plane is on the still water surface and z axis is perpendicularly upwards a local coordinate system x i y i z i α i β i γ i is set at the mass center of the ith module the rotation center for each module is identical to its mass center the wave incident angle of 0 degree is set along x axis and 90 wave is along y axis based on the assumption of linear wave theory dean and dalrymple 1991 the motion equation of the modularized floating structure is formulated as 1 m x r s x f w f h f c where vector x x 1 t x 2 t x n t t is the displacement vector of the modularized floating structure that is formed by the state of each module for the ith module vector x i x i y i z i α i β i γ i t represents the displacements of surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw respectively matrix m diag m 1 m n is the mass matrix of the whole floating structure where diag denotes a diagonal matrix matrix m i diag m m m i x i y i z is the mass matrix of the ith module where symbol m is the mass of module symbols i x i y and i z are the inertial moments about x y and z axes respectively symbols r and s are the buoyant restoring stiffness matrix of water and the stiffness matrix of the mooring system respectively for simplicity matrix s is defined as a constant diagonal matrix the buoyant restoring stiffness matrix is r diag r 1 r n where r i is for the ith module expressed as 2 r i 3 3 ρ g a w r i 3 5 r i 5 3 ρ g a w x d a r i 4 4 ρ g a w y 2 d a r i 5 5 ρ g a w x 2 d a where j k means the element of the matrix at the jth row and the kth column symbol ρ is the density of water and g is the acceleration of gravity symbols a w and v w are the water plane area and volume of the water in the right side of eq 1 vector f w is the wave force acting on the floating structure which consists of the wave force vector of each module f w f 1 w t f 2 w t f n w t t the irregular waves contain multiple frequencies for unit height wave with a frequency ω k the wave force vector acts on the ith module is defined as f i ω k in a specific sea area the statistic characteristics change little with time and can be described by the wave energy spectrum s ω zhang and yang 2015 in this paper the jonswap spectrum is chosen to describe the wave energy density because it is the most commonly used wave spectra in marine engineering onorato et al 2001 the expression of the jonswap spectrum is 3 s ω ζ h s 2 ω p 4 ω 5 exp 1 25 ω p 4 ω 4 κ exp ω ω p 2 2 σ 2 ω p 4 where ζ h s ω p κ σ and ω are respectively the dimensional constant the significant wave height the dominant wave frequency the peak enhancement factor the peak shape parameter and the wave frequency then for the ith module the wave force vector f i w can be approximately written as xia et al 2019 4 f i w k 1 k 2 s ω k δ ω f i ω k where f i ω k f i ω k e i ω k t θ k j 1 n a i j ω k x j b i j ω k x j where f i ω k a i j ω k and b i j ω k are the wave excitation amplitude added mass matrix and added damping matrix for a certain wave frequency ω k which can be derived by the linear wave theory dean and dalrymple 1991 symbol δ ω is a frequency step in the right side of eq 1 vector f h is the hinged connector force vector that acts on the mass centers of modules of the floating structure to get the hinged connector force f h we need firstly to derived the hinged connector load f h that is the internal forces of hinge connector the hinged connector is regarded as a rigid constraint of the two adjacent modules in some degrees of freedom in this paper there are two hinged connectors deployed between two modules as shown in fig 1 which limits the related surge sway heave roll and yaw motions and releases pitch motion however the arrangement of the hinged connectors makes the floating structure existing over constrained in x y z α and γ directions for simplify we suppose that connector 1 shown in fig 1 constrains the related movements in x y z directions and connector 2 only constrains the related movements in x z directions making the two adjacent modules only exist related pitch motion according to the virtual work principle the constraint equation of the ith and i 1 th module is 5 d k x i t x i 1 t t 0 where the displacement constraint matrix d k can be written as 6 d k d k a d k b where d k a 1 0 0 0 z k 1 h y k 1 h 0 1 0 z k 1 h 0 x k 1 h 0 0 1 y k 1 h x k 1 h 0 1 0 0 0 z k 2 h y k 2 h 0 0 1 y k 2 h x k 2 h 0 d k b 1 0 0 0 z k 1 1 h y k 1 1 h 0 1 0 z k 1 1 h 0 x k 1 1 h 0 0 1 y k 1 1 h x k 1 1 h 0 1 0 0 0 z k 1 2 h y k 1 2 h 0 0 1 y k 1 2 h x k 1 2 h 0 x k j h c k j h x c k c 0 x x k 1 j h c k j h x c k 1 c 0 x z k j h c k j h z c k c 0 z z k 1 j h c k j h z c k 1 c 0 z y k j h c k j h y c k c 0 y y k 1 j h c k j h y c k 1 c 0 y matrix d k is the constraint relationship between the kth and k 1 th module where vectors c k c 0 c k c 0 1 c k c 0 2 c k c 0 3 t and c k j h c k j h x c k j h y c k j h z t are respectively the locations of the mass center of the kth module and the center of the jth joint connector two joint connectors between two adjacent modules in the global frame under static state matrix d k a corresponds to the displacement of the kth module and d k b corresponds to the displacement of the k 1 th module the first three rows of matrix d k corresponds to the constraint relation of hinged connector 1 the last two rows of d k corresponds to the constraint relation of hinged connector 2 the connector forces are derived according to lagrange theorem where the lagrangian multipliers are viewed as the generalized forces corresponding to each constraint degree of freedom sun et al 2011 for the whole structure the constraint matrix d r 5 n 1 6 n is composed by d k 7 d d 1 a d 1 b 0 0 0 0 d 2 a d 2 b 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 d n 1 a d n 1 b let symbol f h k f k 1 x f k 1 y f k 1 z f k 2 x f k 2 z t denote the hinged connector load internal forces between the kth and k 1 th modules where the first three elements correspond to the load of connector 1 and the last two elements for the load of connector 2 for the floating structure the hinged connector load can be expressed as f h f h 1 t f h n 1 t t then the connector force vector f h that acts on the mass centers of modules for the floating structure is expressed as 8 f h d t f h the motion equation of the modularized floating structure eq 1 changes to a differential algebraic equation as follow 9 m x r s x f w d t f h f c d x 0 to implement the control process the thrusters propellers are mounted on the bottom of each module identically vector f c in eq 1 is the control force vector acting on the mass centers of modules of the floating structure for the kth module the deployment of the thrusters propellers is shown in fig 2 to control the heave roll and pitch motions of the floating structure thrusters propellers that produce vertical forces are mounted in the bottom of each module the more propellers are the less thrust required from each propeller the better reliability obtained for control on the other hand larger number of propellers may have more costs here we do not discuss the optimal option on the number of propellers which really depends on particular engineering applications in this paper we choose 12 propellers for control three propellers as a sub group are placed in each corner of a module as shown in fig 2 the thrusts of the propellers on the kth module are expressed as u k u k 1 u k 12 t that generates a control force vector on the center of the kth module of the floating structure when the floating structure is static the control thrust of the jth propeller acts on the kth module at the mounting point of c k j u 0 in the local frame the mass center of the kth module is at the point c k c 0 in the global frame when the system moves the motion of the kth module is x k x k y k z k α k β k γ k t then the locations of the mass center and the mounting point of the jth propeller can be written as 10 c k c c k c 0 x k y k z k t c k j u c k c tran α k β k γ k c k j u 0 k 1 n j 1 4 where tran is the rotation matrix loukogeorgaki and angelides 2005 whose expression is 11 tran α β γ cos γ cos β sin γ cos α cos γ sin β sin α sin γ sin α cos γ cos α sin β sin γ cos β cos β cos α sin α sin β sin γ cos γ sin α sin β sin γ cos α sin β cos β sin α cos β cos α then in the global coordination the control force vector of the jth thruster acting on the mass center of the kth module is written as 12 f k j c tran α k β k γ k 0 0 u k j t k 1 n j 1 12 the position vector from the mounting point of the jth thruster to the mass center of the kth module can be written as 13 v k j c k j u c k c k 1 n j 1 12 therefore the control moment vector of the jth thruster acting on the mass center of the kth module is expressed as 14 m k j c v k j f k j c k 1 n j 1 12 considering all the propellers mounting on the kth module the control force vector acting on the mass center is 15 f k c u k j 1 12 f k j c t j 1 12 m k j c t t k 1 n then the control force vector of the thrusters acting on the whole floating structure system is f c f 1 c t f n c t which is the function of thrusts of the propellers u 1 t u n t the motion equation eq 1 can be rewritten as 16 m x r s x f w d t f h f c u 1 t u n t d x 0 because of the complexity of the floating structure the wave force vector f w and the hinged connectors force vector f h cannot be observed accurately so in the control process the load vector shown in eq 17 is assumed as uncertain load 17 f u n f w d t f h to be estimated next we will design a control algorithm to determine the thrusts of the propellers u k 1 u k 12 t for each module subsequently to determine the control force vector f c which controls the heave roll and pitch motions 3 design of control algorithm for thrusters in this section control algorithm is designed to get the thrusts of the propellers u k that mainly suppress the heave roll and pitch motions considering the thrusters only provide vertical control forces thus the control force vector in eq 15 acting on the mass center of the kth module can be expressed as f k c u k 0 0 f k c z f k z α f k c β 0 t when the motion of floating structure is small the elements f k c z f k c α and f k c β are the required control force and moments in the z α and β directions once the elements f k c z f k c α and f k c β are determined the thrusts of the propellers u k can be obtained from eq 15 motion equation in eq 16 originally is a coupled equation due to the terms of added mass and damping in the wave force however eq 16 can be regarded as an uncoupled equation once the wave force is treated as uncertain force to be estimated thus only the directions in control are considered and the motion equation of the kth module can be expressed as 18 m z k η k z z k f k u n z f k c z i x α k η k α α k f k u n α f k c α i y β k η k β β k f k u n β f k c β where f k u n z f k u n α and f k u n β are the uncertain loads in the z α and β directions symbols m i x and i y are the mass and the inertial moments about x y axes of the kth module symbols η k z η k α and η k β respectively correspond to the 6 k 3 th 6 k 2 th and 6 k 1 th diagonal elements of matrix r s considering the simplicity and robustness in a control process a pd algorithm is chosen to estimate the uncertain loads an estimator is required in conjunction with the pd algorithm for the kth module the control force and moments in the directions of z α and β can be expressed as 19 f k c z p k z z k d k z z k f ˆ k u n z f k c α p k α α k d k α α k f ˆ k u n α f k c β p k β β k d k β β k f ˆ k u n β where parameters p k z p k α p k β and d k z d k α d k β are the feedback coefficients to be determined terms f ˆ k u n z f ˆ k u n α and f ˆ k u n β are the estimations of the uncertain loads f k u n z f k u n α and f k u n β an estimator of the uncertain load needs to be developed in an adaptive way since the uncertain load changes from time to time there are some options on the technique basis such as the h based μ synthesis controllers hassani et al 2017 the sliding mode controller rabanal et al 2016 nonlinear observer xu et al 2018 back stepping method yu et al 2019 etc in this paper an adaptive rbfnn method liu 2018 is employed to build the estimator because it can fit any time varying load simply and conveniently and have a good learning ability of the uncertain wave condition the radial basis function of the rbfnn method is caussian function taking z direction for instance the estimator of the uncertain load of the kth module is written as 20 f ˆ k u n z w ˆ k z t h z k where 21 h z k exp z k σ k z 1 2 b k z 1 2 exp z k σ k z m 2 b k z m 2 t w ˆ k z w ˆ k z 1 w ˆ k z m t in eq 21 function vector h z k is the output of hidden layer that contains m numbers of caussian functions as neural nets for the mth function exp z k σ k z m 2 b k z m 2 parameters σ k z m and b k z m are the coordinate values of center point and the width values of the caussian function to be determined artificially according to the value range of the uncertain load symbol w ˆ k z is the weight vector of the radial basis functions to be designed substituting the control force in z direction in eq 19 into the first equation of eq 18 we have 22 m z k d k z z k η k z p k z z k f k u n z f ˆ k u n z the control goal is to suppress the heave motion to zero with the initial guess of the control force in z direction the control error is 23 e k z 0 z k z k thus eq 22 becomes 24 m e k z d k z e k z p k z η k z e k z f ˆ k u n z f k u n z in control process the estimator f ˆ k u n z is required to infinitely approach to the real uncertain load f k u n z which leads to 25 m e k z d k z e k z p k z η k z e k z 0 thus the parameters p k z and d k z need to be designed to make all the roots of the polynomial m s 2 d k z s p k z η k z 0 be in the left side of the complex plane as for the estimator f ˆ k u n z shown in eq 20 the adaptive law of the weight value w ˆ k z is determined based on the lyapunov stability criterion of the control system according to eq 24 the state equation of control error can be written as 26 e k z λ k z e k z b f ˆ k u n z f k u n z where 27 e k z e k z e k z t λ k z 1 m 0 1 d k z p k z η k z b 1 m 0 1 t set the optimal weight value to be 28 w k z arg min w k z ω sup f ˆ k u n z f k u n z define the minimal estimated error to be 29 ε f ˆ k u n z w k z f k u n z substituting eq 29 and eq 22 into eq 26 we get 30 e k z λ k z e k z b w ˆ k z w k z t h z k ε design a lyapunov function about the errors e k z and w k z as follow 31 v 1 2 e k z t p e k z 1 2 γ k z w ˆ k z w k z t w ˆ k z w k z where matrix p is symmetric and positive to be designed which should satisfy the lyapunov equation of λ k z t p p λ k z q where matrix q 0 coefficient γ is a positive constant defining v 1 1 2 e k z t p e k z and v 2 1 2 γ k z w ˆ k z w k z t w ˆ k z w k z with substituting eq 26 the derivatives of v 1 and v 2 can be written as 32 v 1 1 2 e k z t p e k z 1 2 e k z t p e k z 1 2 e k z t q e k z w ˆ k z w k z t e k z t p b h z k ε e k z t p b v 2 1 γ k z w ˆ k z w k z t w ˆ k z the derivative of v is 33 v 1 2 e k z t q e k z ε e k z t p b 1 γ k z w ˆ k z w k z t w ˆ k z γ k z e k z t p b h z k by setting the weight value to be 34 w ˆ k z γ k z e k z t p b h z k we have 35 v 1 2 e k z t q e k z ε e k z t p b since the first term of the right hand side of eq 35 is always negative and the approximation error ε is very small by using the adaptive rbfnn method thus it has v 0 the convergence is 36 e k z 2 λ max p b ε λ min q where λ is the characteristic value of matrix generally speaking for the control force of the kth module s heave motion in eq 19 the feedback coefficients of p k z and d k z need to be determined to make all the roots of the polynomial m s 2 d k z s p k z η k z 0 be in the left side of the complex plane namely the real part of roots must be negative the estimator of the uncertain load is defined by eq 20 and the adaptive law of the weights of the neural nets is set as eq 34 for the control moments of the roll and pitch motions the derivation processes are the same the required control force and moments f k c z f k c α and f k c β on the mass center of the kth module can be obtained in practice the control forces cannot act on the mass center directly they are implemented through the thrusts of the propellers u k 1 u k 12 t that associate with f k c through eq 15 therefore the thrusts u k 1 u k 12 t can be derived as long as f k c is known for each module there are 12 propellers for controlling the motions in three directions to get the least energy consumption and minimize the difference among thrusts the sequential quadratic programming method nocedal and wright 2006 is applied to determine the thrust for each propeller the optimal problem is described as follows 37 min j 0 t k 1 n j 1 12 u k j 2 d t s t f k c u k 1 u k 2 u k 12 0 0 f k c z f k z α f k c β 0 t u k j u max k 1 n j 1 12 the optimization objective is to get the least control energy with equal weight for all thrusts the constraint is set to make the composed thrusts in eq 15 satisfy the required control force derived from the pd algorithm all thrusts are limited by a saturated output u max 4 numerical experiments numerical simulation model is a five modular floating system n 5 all the modules are the same and the parameters such as mass rotational inertia height of mass center structure size and the hydrodynamic characteristic etc can be found in article xu et al 2018 the modules are connected by hinged connectors the mounting locations of the connectors parameters in constraint metrics d k a and d k b the locations of propellers and the coefficients of the control system are shown in table 1 the water depth is 300 m the jonswap spectrum is chosen to describe the wave energy density as shown in eq 3 the parameters of the jonswap spectrum are defined as below the significant wave height h s is 3 m for sea state 3 the dimensional constant ζ and the peak enhancement factor κ are 0 3125 and 3 3 respectively the peak shape parameter σ is 0 007 when ω ω p otherwise is 0 009 the dominant wave frequency ω p and the wave angle θ are obtained depending on the observation of waves in the specific sea area in this paper we present three study cases whose dominant frequency and wave angle are tabulated in table 2 the dominant frequency for case 1 is of 0 618 rad s that corresponds to the wave period of 10s the dominant frequency for case 2 is of 1 257 rad s corresponding to the wave period of 5s the both wave periods are very common in the study of ocean engineering the parameters of case 2 here are the same as the parameters used in the case study of the reference xia et al 2019 thus it is possible to compare the advantages of the proposed method with previous research works case 3 demonstrates the flexibility and adaptability of the proposed strategy while the dominant frequency changes continuously from 0 3rad s to 1 5rad s which enables us to assess the control performance in a varying sea condition case 1 demonstrates the control of multi modular floating platform in a random heading wave with wave height 3m and wave period 10s the time responses of the third module are shown in fig 3 the time responses of the other modules are not given here because they are similar to that of the third module the time responses broken lines of the third module are irregular and oscillatory in all degrees of freedom without control as the control is on the motions black solid lines of heave z roll α and pitch β are almost completely suppressed the subplots in c d and e are the enlarged views of the controlled motions the controlled heave roll and pitch motions are effectively reduced by one order in magnitude of the uncontrolled responses however the control has little influence on the surge sway and yaw motions because the vertical thrusts of propellers cannot manipulate these motions this issue can be just solved by the use of hinged floating structure which makes the whole structure as a rigid body so that limits the relative motions in surge sway and yaw as we can be seen from fig 3 b d and f the sway roll and yaw motions are indeed very small although the surge motion in fig 3 a is nontrivial because of the heading wave 0 wave angle the surge motion of hinged structures is significantly smaller than that of flexibly connected structures xu el at 2018 thus the use of hinged floating structures leads to a benefit that all 6 dof motions of modules can be suppressed by only using vertical thrusts making the control relatively simple and economic in comparison with the previous works xu el at 2018 xia el at 2019 now look at the hinge connector loads during the control process there are two hinged connectors between the second and the third modules fig 4 shows the connector loads in three directions the solid lines indicate the loads with control and the broken lines indicate the loads without control for the loads in x and y directions the solid lines almost overlap the broken lines which means that the loads of connectors are rarely affected by the control process the load in x direction is capped by 1500 kn and the load in y direction is capped by 3 kn however the loads in z direction are different which shows that the load in z direction becomes smaller when control turns on it is reasonable because the propellers provide thrusts in z direction to cope with wave disturbance which may reduce the connector load in z direction now look at the thrusts of the propellers mounted on the third module because the weights of all thrusts are set to be equal in the optimization process the output thrusts of the propellers mounted at the same corner are almost the same as shown in fig 5 because the propellers are mounted symmetrically about the y axis also because the wave forces in y α and γ directions are very small due to 0 angle wave the thrusts are distributed symmetrically where u 3 1 u 3 7 u 3 2 u 3 8 u 3 6 u 3 12 here the maximum thrust is capped by 500 kn finally look at the uncertain loads and the performance of its rbfnn estimator fig 6 shows the uncertain loads acting on the third module where the solid lines show the real loads that are derived from eq 17 and the dash lines show the estimated loads that are obtained by the rbfnn method fig 6 shows that the adaptive rbfnn estimator can automatically trace the real loads quickly and accurately with an error smaller than 8 the control thrusts from the propellers almost offset the disturbance of external wave forces making the floating system motionless in the concerned directions case 2 demonstrates the control of multi modular floating platform in a random wave with wave height 3m wave angle of 45 and wave frequency of 1 257rad s that corresponds to a wave period of 5s the control results are shown in fig 7 since the hinged floating structure rigidly constrains the relative motions of surge sway and yaw we only show the responses of heave roll and pitch in fig 7 a c with without control the control suppresses all the motions plots d f show the uncertain loads on the third module and the corresponding estimated loads the results indicate the rbfnn estimator works perfectly well plots g i show the hinged loads between the second and third module whether the control involves or not it makes no significant difference in hinge connection loads for the wave angle 45 the connector load in y direction is larger than that of heading wave at 0 angle plots j k show the total thrust of sub groups of propellers at each corner the first sub group includes u 3 1 u 3 2 and u 3 3 the second sub group includes u 3 4 u 3 5 and u 3 6 then the third and fourth sub groups respectively include u 3 7 u 3 8 u 3 9 and u 3 10 u 3 11 and u 3 12 the total control thrust of a sub group is the sum of thrusts of three propellers in the same sub group fig 7 j shows the total control thrusts of the first and second sub groups and fig 7 k shows the third and fourth sub groups the first two sub groups have the largest total control thrust which is capped by 1000 kn fig 7 l m show the thrusts in the second and third sub groups from the plots we can see that the thrusts generated from different propellers are balanced at the same level because of using the sequential quadratic programming case 2 is particularly studied here in the purpose of illustrating the advantages of the proposed method in this paper the parameters of case 2 were studied in the previous works xu et al 2018 xia et al 2019 so that we can conduct comparative studies here firstly we state that the major contribution of this paper is the proposal of developing a motion control strategy based on hinged floating structures rather than flexible connected floating structures as done before this proposal leads to a benefit that the control implementation becomes simple and economic in engineering applications in what follows we tabulate the differences and effectiveness of the proposed method with the previous methods in table 3 for a comparison study among the three methods the type of structure used is different we particularly propose the use of a hinged type multi modular floating system comparing the flexible floating systems the hinged system provides rigid constraints on relative motions of surge sway and yaw therefore only the motions in heave roll and pitch need to be controlled this difference leads to the benefits of less numbers of control thrusters required and the use of simpler thrusters under the same condition it means that the new proposal can greatly simplify the control algorithm reduce control equipment use cheaper thrusters making the control simple and economic looking at the motions in control the proposed method and the method xia et al 2019 aim at the suppression of all 6 degrees of freedom while the method xu et al 2018 only suppresses three motions to achieve 6dof control the proposed method only needs 4 unidirectional propellers while the method xia et al 2019 requires 8 unidirectional propellers mounted in different directions propellers mounted in different directions are much more expensive equipment including extra maintenance service the deployment of propellers is quite different the proposed method only needs thrusts in z direction while other two methods require multi directional installation of propellers it implies that the proposed method is much easy to apply the most important fact can be seen from the last row of table 3 where the maximum thrust of propeller for the proposed method is 1000 kn significantly smaller than that 5000 kn of other two methods according to the simulation result of case 2 this efficiency is mainly attributed to the use of the hinged structure because its rigid constraints avoid unnecessary efforts of controlling some relative movements between modules case 3 demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed control scheme for a varying sea environment fig 8 shows the responses and the control thrusts when the wave frequency changes from 0 3rad s to 1 5rad s for the test purpose assume that the wave frequency changes by a step of 0 0121rad s for every 20 wave periods as shown in fig 8 a at the same time the wave height also changes from 3m to 5m accordingly as shown in fig 8 b of course the assumed situation is a bit harsh and unusual because the wave height usually tends to getting low as the wave frequency increases larger wave height may cause larger responses and high wave frequency may cause fast change of uncertain load which challenges the adaptability and reliability of the control method fig 8 c e show the time responses of motions in the concerned directions we can see that without control the responses in the concerned directions fluctuate strongly in certain time intervals in addition the amplitude of the roll motion has peaks around 0 75rad s and 0 98rad s the pitch motion increases sharply in the interval of 0 63 0 66rad s and also has a peak around 0 98rad s with the control method the motions in the target directions are suppressed completely figure f i show the thrusts of the second fifth eighth and eleventh propellers mounted in the third module the thrusts of all the propellers are no more than 15000 kn the thrusts increase as the heave and pitch motions increase and are large in the range of 0 48 0 66 rad s and 0 95 1 09 rad s in the heading wave the wave force is symmetrical about the x z plane the thrusts of the propellers are almost symmetrical which is reflected in figure f i that the thrust of the second propeller is the same as that of the eighth propeller and similarly the thrusts of the fifth and eleventh propellers are the same case 3 shows that the control algorithm has good adaptability to the drastic change of sea conditions we have also carried out many other numerical tests not reported here for different wave conditions the control method performs well as expected 5 conclusion this paper presents a control method in conjunction with hinged connectors to suppress the heave roll and pitch motions of a modularized floating structure in random sea with hinged connectors proposed in control the deployment of control thrusters and the control scheme are greatly simplified and economic in comparison with existing methods it only requires to control the three motions of heave roll and pitch by using thrusters mounted vertically on each module resulting in overall motion mitigation a pd algorithm combined with an estimator of uncertain wave load built by the rbfnn neuron networks is developed sqp is employed to optimally distribute the thrust to each propeller numerical simulations show that the effectiveness of the control strategy the rbfnn estimator could track the uncertain load of the floating structure accurately and adaptively in this paper the control configuration is innovative and an adaptive neural network is firstly developed to estimate the uncertain load caused by wave and hinged connectors the systematic approach for motion mitigation could be a good reference for the stability control of marine structures credit authorship contribution statement shuyan xia

vlfs have been concerned in ocean and costal engineering as early as 1920s large scale floating structures were proposed as airplane supply and navigation station in the atlantic ocean armstrong 1924 until 1980s large numbers of architects city planners and engineers have been devoted to the field of vlfs in the course of vlfs development two renowned projects significantly promoted the researches of vlfs one is the megafloat project suzuki 2005 sponsored by japanese government another is the project of mobile offshore base mob bhattacharya et al 2001 suzuki 2017 funded by the us navy the megafloat project led to a pontoon type floating airport built and tested in tokyo bay in 1999 which is the only floating airport constructed in human history shuku et al 2001 since the scale of a vlfs is about few thousand meters the pontoon structure cannot withstand huge bending loads mob is a type of modularized floating airport which usually consists of a number of connected floating modules ohmatsu 2005 wang and tay 2011 although mob overcomes the weakness of pontoon structures the connection technology of modules has been challenging there are few kinds of proposed connectors such as flexible connector gao et al 2013 hinged connector wu 1996 dynamic positioning method sørensen et al 1996 etc due to the release of some degree of freedom by using connectors large movement of floating modules has been seriously concerned for modularized floating structures because it deteriorates operation conditions and seriously affects the service life and maintenance cost motion mitigation is a critical issue for modularized floating structures but there has been not much literature on it for the stability control of multi modular floating structures a semi active scheme xia et al 2016 was proposed by using tunable air spring connectors on the basis of the amplitude death mechanism dynamic position dp system sørensen 2011 uses thrusters propellers to drive a marine vehicle towards the designated position or follow a default route note that dp is a kind of positioning technique rather than resolving vibration problems of a floating structure nevertheless dp system s thrust control algorithms balchen et al 1980 power distribution methods veksler et al 2016 experimental studies fossen and grovlen 1998 etc can be a good reference to develop vibration control technology for floating structures for vibration control xia etc proposed a backstepping method to suppress motions of modules under uncertain sea conditions xia et al 2019 in marine engineering there are some other relevant works on specific single direction motion control such as the heave motion reduction of a multi spar floating platform li et al 2013 suppression of the pitch motion of spar type floating structure ha and cheong 2016 the pitch motion reduction of a rectangular box floating structure yin 2017 generally speaking there are few researches on the motion suppression of modular floating structures in this paper a control scheme is proposed in conjunction with hinge connection to suppress motions of multi modular floating systems in uncertain sea conditions based on the principle of simplicity and practicality the use of hinge connectors is put forward for the control and the hinge connectors can perfectly constrain the relative motions of surge sway and yaw between connected modules therefore only the motions of heave roll and pitch need to be simply dealt with in control to suppress these three types of motions only thrusts in vertical direction are required so that it leads to a great simplification in the thruster deployment and the control scheme although there is no control in surge sway and yaw the whole rigid floating system only has much smaller drifting motions in comparing with other three motions in the study the floating structure consists of a number of semi submersible modules connected by the hinged connectors the arrangement of thrusters underneath a semi submersible module will be elaborated because of the complexity structure of the modularized semi submersible module the forces vectors of waves and connectors acting on the floating structure will be considered as unknown load a neural network scheme is used for the estimation of uncertain load referred to radial basis function neural network rbfnn it can fit any time varying function simply and conveniently chen et al 1991 in this paper an adaptive rbfnn method is developed to estimate the wave and connector forces imposed on the floating structure to suppress the heave roll and pitch motions of the modular floating structure the proportional derivative pd algorithm is employed in conjunction with the rbfnn estimator liu 2018 in order to distribute the control output reasonably an optimization method of sequential quadratic programming sqp nocedal and wright 2006 is used with the goal of the minimum energy consumption to determine the control thrusts from propellers with output saturation constraint the novelty of this paper is to put forward the idea using hinge connection in a control scheme in comparison with the previous works xia et al 2019 2016 this idea enables one to only concern few motion controls in heave roll and pitch it greatly simplifies the arrangement of thrusters and the control scheme so that one can realize the design concept of using as fewer thrusters as possible and control as more motions as possible of course the idea also can save a great deal of investment in engineering applications because of the simple layout this paper is organized as follow in the next section the mathematical model of the multi modular floating structure with vertical propellers is derived then the control process is derived to get the thrusts of the propellers afterwards numerical simulations are given to verify the effectiveness of the control method at last a conclusion is drawn 2 mathematical model of modularized floating structure with propellers as shown in fig 1 the modularized floating structure consists of n semi submersible modules which are connected by hinged connectors between two adjacent modules two hinged connectors are mounted an anchor chain is installed on each module to prevent the whole floating structure from drifting global coordinate system x y z is set of which x y plane is on the still water surface and z axis is perpendicularly upwards a local coordinate system x i y i z i α i β i γ i is set at the mass center of the ith module the rotation center for each module is identical to its mass center the wave incident angle of 0 degree is set along x axis and 90 wave is along y axis based on the assumption of linear wave theory dean and dalrymple 1991 the motion equation of the modularized floating structure is formulated as 1 m x r s x f w f h f c where vector x x 1 t x 2 t x n t t is the displacement vector of the modularized floating structure that is formed by the state of each module for the ith module vector x i x i y i z i α i β i γ i t represents the displacements of surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw respectively matrix m diag m 1 m n is the mass matrix of the whole floating structure where diag denotes a diagonal matrix matrix m i diag m m m i x i y i z is the mass matrix of the ith module where symbol m is the mass of module symbols i x i y and i z are the inertial moments about x y and z axes respectively symbols r and s are the buoyant restoring stiffness matrix of water and the stiffness matrix of the mooring system respectively for simplicity matrix s is defined as a constant diagonal matrix the buoyant restoring stiffness matrix is r diag r 1 r n where r i is for the ith module expressed as 2 r i 3 3 ρ g a w r i 3 5 r i 5 3 ρ g a w x d a r i 4 4 ρ g a w y 2 d a r i 5 5 ρ g a w x 2 d a where j k means the element of the matrix at the jth row and the kth column symbol ρ is the density of water and g is the acceleration of gravity symbols a w and v w are the water plane area and volume of the water in the right side of eq 1 vector f w is the wave force acting on the floating structure which consists of the wave force vector of each module f w f 1 w t f 2 w t f n w t t the irregular waves contain multiple frequencies for unit height wave with a frequency ω k the wave force vector acts on the ith module is defined as f i ω k in a specific sea area the statistic characteristics change little with time and can be described by the wave energy spectrum s ω zhang and yang 2015 in this paper the jonswap spectrum is chosen to describe the wave energy density because it is the most commonly used wave spectra in marine engineering onorato et al 2001 the expression of the jonswap spectrum is 3 s ω ζ h s 2 ω p 4 ω 5 exp 1 25 ω p 4 ω 4 κ exp ω ω p 2 2 σ 2 ω p 4 where ζ h s ω p κ σ and ω are respectively the dimensional constant the significant wave height the dominant wave frequency the peak enhancement factor the peak shape parameter and the wave frequency then for the ith module the wave force vector f i w can be approximately written as xia et al 2019 4 f i w k 1 k 2 s ω k δ ω f i ω k where f i ω k f i ω k e i ω k t θ k j 1 n a i j ω k x j b i j ω k x j where f i ω k a i j ω k and b i j ω k are the wave excitation amplitude added mass matrix and added damping matrix for a certain wave frequency ω k which can be derived by the linear wave theory dean and dalrymple 1991 symbol δ ω is a frequency step in the right side of eq 1 vector f h is the hinged connector force vector that acts on the mass centers of modules of the floating structure to get the hinged connector force f h we need firstly to derived the hinged connector load f h that is the internal forces of hinge connector the hinged connector is regarded as a rigid constraint of the two adjacent modules in some degrees of freedom in this paper there are two hinged connectors deployed between two modules as shown in fig 1 which limits the related surge sway heave roll and yaw motions and releases pitch motion however the arrangement of the hinged connectors makes the floating structure existing over constrained in x y z α and γ directions for simplify we suppose that connector 1 shown in fig 1 constrains the related movements in x y z directions and connector 2 only constrains the related movements in x z directions making the two adjacent modules only exist related pitch motion according to the virtual work principle the constraint equation of the ith and i 1 th module is 5 d k x i t x i 1 t t 0 where the displacement constraint matrix d k can be written as 6 d k d k a d k b where d k a 1 0 0 0 z k 1 h y k 1 h 0 1 0 z k 1 h 0 x k 1 h 0 0 1 y k 1 h x k 1 h 0 1 0 0 0 z k 2 h y k 2 h 0 0 1 y k 2 h x k 2 h 0 d k b 1 0 0 0 z k 1 1 h y k 1 1 h 0 1 0 z k 1 1 h 0 x k 1 1 h 0 0 1 y k 1 1 h x k 1 1 h 0 1 0 0 0 z k 1 2 h y k 1 2 h 0 0 1 y k 1 2 h x k 1 2 h 0 x k j h c k j h x c k c 0 x x k 1 j h c k j h x c k 1 c 0 x z k j h c k j h z c k c 0 z z k 1 j h c k j h z c k 1 c 0 z y k j h c k j h y c k c 0 y y k 1 j h c k j h y c k 1 c 0 y matrix d k is the constraint relationship between the kth and k 1 th module where vectors c k c 0 c k c 0 1 c k c 0 2 c k c 0 3 t and c k j h c k j h x c k j h y c k j h z t are respectively the locations of the mass center of the kth module and the center of the jth joint connector two joint connectors between two adjacent modules in the global frame under static state matrix d k a corresponds to the displacement of the kth module and d k b corresponds to the displacement of the k 1 th module the first three rows of matrix d k corresponds to the constraint relation of hinged connector 1 the last two rows of d k corresponds to the constraint relation of hinged connector 2 the connector forces are derived according to lagrange theorem where the lagrangian multipliers are viewed as the generalized forces corresponding to each constraint degree of freedom sun et al 2011 for the whole structure the constraint matrix d r 5 n 1 6 n is composed by d k 7 d d 1 a d 1 b 0 0 0 0 d 2 a d 2 b 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 d n 1 a d n 1 b let symbol f h k f k 1 x f k 1 y f k 1 z f k 2 x f k 2 z t denote the hinged connector load internal forces between the kth and k 1 th modules where the first three elements correspond to the load of connector 1 and the last two elements for the load of connector 2 for the floating structure the hinged connector load can be expressed as f h f h 1 t f h n 1 t t then the connector force vector f h that acts on the mass centers of modules for the floating structure is expressed as 8 f h d t f h the motion equation of the modularized floating structure eq 1 changes to a differential algebraic equation as follow 9 m x r s x f w d t f h f c d x 0 to implement the control process the thrusters propellers are mounted on the bottom of each module identically vector f c in eq 1 is the control force vector acting on the mass centers of modules of the floating structure for the kth module the deployment of the thrusters propellers is shown in fig 2 to control the heave roll and pitch motions of the floating structure thrusters propellers that produce vertical forces are mounted in the bottom of each module the more propellers are the less thrust required from each propeller the better reliability obtained for control on the other hand larger number of propellers may have more costs here we do not discuss the optimal option on the number of propellers which really depends on particular engineering applications in this paper we choose 12 propellers for control three propellers as a sub group are placed in each corner of a module as shown in fig 2 the thrusts of the propellers on the kth module are expressed as u k u k 1 u k 12 t that generates a control force vector on the center of the kth module of the floating structure when the floating structure is static the control thrust of the jth propeller acts on the kth module at the mounting point of c k j u 0 in the local frame the mass center of the kth module is at the point c k c 0 in the global frame when the system moves the motion of the kth module is x k x k y k z k α k β k γ k t then the locations of the mass center and the mounting point of the jth propeller can be written as 10 c k c c k c 0 x k y k z k t c k j u c k c tran α k β k γ k c k j u 0 k 1 n j 1 4 where tran is the rotation matrix loukogeorgaki and angelides 2005 whose expression is 11 tran α β γ cos γ cos β sin γ cos α cos γ sin β sin α sin γ sin α cos γ cos α sin β sin γ cos β cos β cos α sin α sin β sin γ cos γ sin α sin β sin γ cos α sin β cos β sin α cos β cos α then in the global coordination the control force vector of the jth thruster acting on the mass center of the kth module is written as 12 f k j c tran α k β k γ k 0 0 u k j t k 1 n j 1 12 the position vector from the mounting point of the jth thruster to the mass center of the kth module can be written as 13 v k j c k j u c k c k 1 n j 1 12 therefore the control moment vector of the jth thruster acting on the mass center of the kth module is expressed as 14 m k j c v k j f k j c k 1 n j 1 12 considering all the propellers mounting on the kth module the control force vector acting on the mass center is 15 f k c u k j 1 12 f k j c t j 1 12 m k j c t t k 1 n then the control force vector of the thrusters acting on the whole floating structure system is f c f 1 c t f n c t which is the function of thrusts of the propellers u 1 t u n t the motion equation eq 1 can be rewritten as 16 m x r s x f w d t f h f c u 1 t u n t d x 0 because of the complexity of the floating structure the wave force vector f w and the hinged connectors force vector f h cannot be observed accurately so in the control process the load vector shown in eq 17 is assumed as uncertain load 17 f u n f w d t f h to be estimated next we will design a control algorithm to determine the thrusts of the propellers u k 1 u k 12 t for each module subsequently to determine the control force vector f c which controls the heave roll and pitch motions 3 design of control algorithm for thrusters in this section control algorithm is designed to get the thrusts of the propellers u k that mainly suppress the heave roll and pitch motions considering the thrusters only provide vertical control forces thus the control force vector in eq 15 acting on the mass center of the kth module can be expressed as f k c u k 0 0 f k c z f k z α f k c β 0 t when the motion of floating structure is small the elements f k c z f k c α and f k c β are the required control force and moments in the z α and β directions once the elements f k c z f k c α and f k c β are determined the thrusts of the propellers u k can be obtained from eq 15 motion equation in eq 16 originally is a coupled equation due to the terms of added mass and damping in the wave force however eq 16 can be regarded as an uncoupled equation once the wave force is treated as uncertain force to be estimated thus only the directions in control are considered and the motion equation of the kth module can be expressed as 18 m z k η k z z k f k u n z f k c z i x α k η k α α k f k u n α f k c α i y β k η k β β k f k u n β f k c β where f k u n z f k u n α and f k u n β are the uncertain loads in the z α and β directions symbols m i x and i y are the mass and the inertial moments about x y axes of the kth module symbols η k z η k α and η k β respectively correspond to the 6 k 3 th 6 k 2 th and 6 k 1 th diagonal elements of matrix r s considering the simplicity and robustness in a control process a pd algorithm is chosen to estimate the uncertain loads an estimator is required in conjunction with the pd algorithm for the kth module the control force and moments in the directions of z α and β can be expressed as 19 f k c z p k z z k d k z z k f ˆ k u n z f k c α p k α α k d k α α k f ˆ k u n α f k c β p k β β k d k β β k f ˆ k u n β where parameters p k z p k α p k β and d k z d k α d k β are the feedback coefficients to be determined terms f ˆ k u n z f ˆ k u n α and f ˆ k u n β are the estimations of the uncertain loads f k u n z f k u n α and f k u n β an estimator of the uncertain load needs to be developed in an adaptive way since the uncertain load changes from time to time there are some options on the technique basis such as the h based μ synthesis controllers hassani et al 2017 the sliding mode controller rabanal et al 2016 nonlinear observer xu et al 2018 back stepping method yu et al 2019 etc in this paper an adaptive rbfnn method liu 2018 is employed to build the estimator because it can fit any time varying load simply and conveniently and have a good learning ability of the uncertain wave condition the radial basis function of the rbfnn method is caussian function taking z direction for instance the estimator of the uncertain load of the kth module is written as 20 f ˆ k u n z w ˆ k z t h z k where 21 h z k exp z k σ k z 1 2 b k z 1 2 exp z k σ k z m 2 b k z m 2 t w ˆ k z w ˆ k z 1 w ˆ k z m t in eq 21 function vector h z k is the output of hidden layer that contains m numbers of caussian functions as neural nets for the mth function exp z k σ k z m 2 b k z m 2 parameters σ k z m and b k z m are the coordinate values of center point and the width values of the caussian function to be determined artificially according to the value range of the uncertain load symbol w ˆ k z is the weight vector of the radial basis functions to be designed substituting the control force in z direction in eq 19 into the first equation of eq 18 we have 22 m z k d k z z k η k z p k z z k f k u n z f ˆ k u n z the control goal is to suppress the heave motion to zero with the initial guess of the control force in z direction the control error is 23 e k z 0 z k z k thus eq 22 becomes 24 m e k z d k z e k z p k z η k z e k z f ˆ k u n z f k u n z in control process the estimator f ˆ k u n z is required to infinitely approach to the real uncertain load f k u n z which leads to 25 m e k z d k z e k z p k z η k z e k z 0 thus the parameters p k z and d k z need to be designed to make all the roots of the polynomial m s 2 d k z s p k z η k z 0 be in the left side of the complex plane as for the estimator f ˆ k u n z shown in eq 20 the adaptive law of the weight value w ˆ k z is determined based on the lyapunov stability criterion of the control system according to eq 24 the state equation of control error can be written as 26 e k z λ k z e k z b f ˆ k u n z f k u n z where 27 e k z e k z e k z t λ k z 1 m 0 1 d k z p k z η k z b 1 m 0 1 t set the optimal weight value to be 28 w k z arg min w k z ω sup f ˆ k u n z f k u n z define the minimal estimated error to be 29 ε f ˆ k u n z w k z f k u n z substituting eq 29 and eq 22 into eq 26 we get 30 e k z λ k z e k z b w ˆ k z w k z t h z k ε design a lyapunov function about the errors e k z and w k z as follow 31 v 1 2 e k z t p e k z 1 2 γ k z w ˆ k z w k z t w ˆ k z w k z where matrix p is symmetric and positive to be designed which should satisfy the lyapunov equation of λ k z t p p λ k z q where matrix q 0 coefficient γ is a positive constant defining v 1 1 2 e k z t p e k z and v 2 1 2 γ k z w ˆ k z w k z t w ˆ k z w k z with substituting eq 26 the derivatives of v 1 and v 2 can be written as 32 v 1 1 2 e k z t p e k z 1 2 e k z t p e k z 1 2 e k z t q e k z w ˆ k z w k z t e k z t p b h z k ε e k z t p b v 2 1 γ k z w ˆ k z w k z t w ˆ k z the derivative of v

ε e k z t p b since the first term of the right hand side of eq 35 is always negative and the approximation error ε is very small by using the adaptive rbfnn method thus it has v 0 the convergence is 36 e k z 2 λ max p b ε λ min q where λ is the characteristic value of matrix generally speaking for the control force of the kth module s heave motion in eq 19 the feedback coefficients of p k z and d k z need to be determined to make all the roots of the polynomial m s 2 d k z s p k z η k z 0 be in the left side of the complex plane namely the real part of roots must be negative the estimator of the uncertain load is defined by eq 20 and the adaptive law of the weights of the neural nets is set as eq 34 for the control moments of the roll and pitch motions the derivation processes are the same the required control force and moments f k c z f k c α and f k c β on the mass center of the kth module can be obtained in practice the control forces cannot act on the mass center directly they are implemented through the thrusts of the propellers u k 1 u k 12 t that associate with f k c through eq 15 therefore the thrusts u k 1 u k 12 t can be derived as long as f k c is known for each module there are 12 propellers for controlling the motions in three directions to get the least energy consumption and minimize the difference among thrusts the sequential quadratic programming method nocedal and wright 2006 is applied to determine the thrust for each propeller the optimal problem is described as follows 37 min j 0 t k 1 n j 1 12 u k j 2 d t s t f k c u k 1 u k 2 u k 12 0 0 f k c z f k z α f k c β 0 t u k j u max k 1 n j 1 12 the optimization objective is to get the least control energy with equal weight for all thrusts the constraint is set to make the composed thrusts in eq 15 satisfy the required control force derived from the pd algorithm all thrusts are limited by a saturated output u max 4 numerical experiments numerical simulation model is a five modular floating system n 5 all the modules are the same and the parameters such as mass rotational inertia height of mass center structure size and the hydrodynamic characteristic etc can be found in article xu et al 2018 the modules are connected by hinged connectors the mounting locations of the connectors parameters in constraint metrics d k a and d k b the locations of propellers and the coefficients of the control system are shown in table 1 the water depth is 300 m the jonswap spectrum is chosen to describe the wave energy density as shown in eq 3 the parameters of the jonswap spectrum are defined as below the significant wave height h s is 3 m for sea state 3 the dimensional constant ζ and the peak enhancement factor κ are 0 3125 and 3 3 respectively the peak shape parameter σ is 0 007 when ω ω p otherwise is 0 009 the dominant wave frequency ω p and the wave angle θ are obtained depending on the observation of waves in the specific sea area in this paper we present three study cases whose dominant frequency and wave angle are tabulated in table 2 the dominant frequency for case 1 is of 0 618 rad s that corresponds to the wave period of 10s the dominant frequency for case 2 is of 1 257 rad s corresponding to the wave period of 5s the both wave periods are very common in the study of ocean engineering the parameters of case 2 here are the same as the parameters used in the case study of the reference xia et al 2019 thus it is possible to compare the advantages of the proposed method with previous research works case 3 demonstrates the flexibility and adaptability of the proposed strategy while the dominant frequency changes continuously from 0 3rad s to 1 5rad s which enables us to assess the control performance in a varying sea condition case 1 demonstrates the control of multi modular floating platform in a random heading wave with wave height 3m and wave period 10s the time responses of the third module are shown in fig 3 the time responses of the other modules are not given here because they are similar to that of the third module the time responses broken lines of the third module are irregular and oscillatory in all degrees of freedom without control as the control is on the motions black solid lines of heave z roll α and pitch β are almost completely suppressed the subplots in c d and e are the enlarged views of the controlled motions the controlled heave roll and pitch motions are effectively reduced by one order in magnitude of the uncontrolled responses however the control has little influence on the surge sway and yaw motions because the vertical thrusts of propellers cannot manipulate these motions this issue can be just solved by the use of hinged floating structure which makes the whole structure as a rigid body so that limits the relative motions in surge sway and yaw as we can be seen from fig 3 b d and f the sway roll and yaw motions are indeed very small although the surge motion in fig 3 a is nontrivial because of the heading wave 0 wave angle the surge motion of hinged structures is significantly smaller than that of flexibly connected structures xu el at 2018 thus the use of hinged floating structures leads to a benefit that all 6 dof motions of modules can be suppressed by only using vertical thrusts making the control relatively simple and economic in comparison with the previous works xu el at 2018 xia el at 2019 now look at the hinge connector loads during the control process there are two hinged connectors between the second and the third modules fig 4 shows the connector loads in three directions the solid lines indicate the loads with control and the broken lines indicate the loads without control for the loads in x and y directions the solid lines almost overlap the broken lines which means that the loads of connectors are rarely affected by the control process the load in x direction is capped by 1500 kn and the load in y direction is capped by 3 kn however the loads in z direction are different which shows that the load in z direction becomes smaller when control turns on it is reasonable because the propellers provide thrusts in z direction to cope with wave disturbance which may reduce the connector load in z direction now look at the thrusts of the propellers mounted on the third module because the weights of all thrusts are set to be equal in the optimization process the output thrusts of the propellers mounted at the same corner are almost the same as shown in fig 5 because the propellers are mounted symmetrically about the y axis also because the wave forces in y α and γ directions are very small due to 0 angle wave the thrusts are distributed symmetrically where u 3 1 u 3 7 u 3 2 u 3 8 u 3 6 u 3 12 here the maximum thrust is capped by 500 kn finally look at the uncertain loads and the performance of its rbfnn estimator fig 6 shows the uncertain loads acting on the third module where the solid lines show the real loads that are derived from eq 17 and the dash lines show the estimated loads that are obtained by the rbfnn method fig 6 shows that the adaptive rbfnn estimator can automatically trace the real loads quickly and accurately with an error smaller than 8 the control thrusts from the propellers almost offset the disturbance of external wave forces making the floating system motionless in the concerned directions case 2 demonstrates the control of multi modular floating platform in a random wave with wave height 3m wave angle of 45 and wave frequency of 1 257rad s that corresponds to a wave period of 5s the control results are shown in fig 7 since the hinged floating structure rigidly constrains the relative motions of surge sway and yaw we only show the responses of heave roll and pitch in fig 7 a c with without control the control suppresses all the motions plots d f show the uncertain loads on the third module and the corresponding estimated loads the results indicate the rbfnn estimator works perfectly well plots g i show the hinged loads between the second and third module whether the control involves or not it makes no significant difference in hinge connection loads for the wave angle 45 the connector load in y direction is larger than that of heading wave at 0 angle plots j k show the total thrust of sub groups of propellers at each corner the first sub group includes u 3 1 u 3 2 and u 3 3 the second sub group includes u 3 4 u 3 5 and u 3 6 then the third and fourth sub groups respectively include u 3 7 u 3 8 u 3 9 and u 3 10 u 3 11 and u 3 12 the total control thrust of a sub group is the sum of thrusts of three propellers in the same sub group fig 7 j shows the total control thrusts of the first and second sub groups and fig 7 k shows the third and fourth sub groups the first two sub groups have the largest total control thrust which is capped by 1000 kn fig 7 l m show the thrusts in the second and third sub groups from the plots we can see that the thrusts generated from different propellers are balanced at the same level because of using the sequential quadratic programming case 2 is particularly studied here in the purpose of illustrating the advantages of the proposed method in this paper the parameters of case 2 were studied in the previous works xu et al 2018 xia et al 2019 so that we can conduct comparative studies here firstly we state that the major contribution of this paper is the proposal of developing a motion control strategy based on hinged floating structures rather than flexible connected floating structures as done before this proposal leads to a benefit that the control implementation becomes simple and economic in engineering applications in what follows we tabulate the differences and effectiveness of the proposed method with the previous methods in table 3 for a comparison study among the three methods the type of structure used is different we particularly propose the use of a hinged type multi modular floating system comparing the flexible floating systems the hinged system provides rigid constraints on relative motions of surge sway and yaw therefore only the motions in heave roll and pitch need to be controlled this difference leads to the benefits of less numbers of control thrusters required and the use of simpler thrusters under the same condition it means that the new proposal can greatly simplify the control algorithm reduce control equipment use cheaper thrusters making the control simple and economic looking at the motions in control the proposed method and the method xia et al 2019 aim at the suppression of all 6 degrees of freedom while the method xu et al 2018 only suppresses three motions to achieve 6dof control the proposed method only needs 4 unidirectional propellers while the method xia et al 2019 requires 8 unidirectional propellers mounted in different directions propellers mounted in different directions are much more expensive equipment including extra maintenance service the deployment of propellers is quite different the proposed method only needs thrusts in z direction while other two methods require multi directional installation of propellers it implies that the proposed method is much easy to apply the most important fact can be seen from the last row of table 3 where the maximum thrust of propeller for the proposed method is 1000 kn significantly smaller than that 5000 kn of other two methods according to the simulation result of case 2 this efficiency is mainly attributed to the use of the hinged structure because its rigid constraints avoid unnecessary efforts of controlling some relative movements between modules case 3 demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed control scheme for a varying sea environment fig 8 shows the responses and the control thrusts when the wave frequency changes from 0 3rad s to 1 5rad s for the test purpose assume that the wave frequency changes by a step of 0 0121rad s for every 20 wave periods as shown in fig 8 a at the same time the wave height also changes from 3m to 5m accordingly as shown in fig 8 b of course the assumed situation is a bit harsh and unusual because the wave height usually tends to getting low as the wave frequency increases larger wave height may cause larger responses and high wave frequency may cause fast change of uncertain load which challenges the adaptability and reliability of the control method fig 8 c e show the time responses of motions in the concerned directions we can see that without control the responses in the concerned directions fluctuate strongly in certain time intervals in addition the amplitude of the roll motion has peaks around 0 75rad s and 0 98rad s the pitch motion increases sharply in the interval of 0 63 0 66rad s and also has a peak around 0 98rad s with the control method the motions in the target directions are suppressed completely figure f i show the thrusts of the second fifth eighth and eleventh propellers mounted in the third module the thrusts of all the propellers are no more than 15000 kn the thrusts increase as the heave and pitch motions increase and are large in the range of 0 48 0 66 rad s and 0 95 1 09 rad s in the heading wave the wave force is symmetrical about the x z plane the thrusts of the propellers are almost symmetrical which is reflected in figure f i that the thrust of the second propeller is the same as that of the eighth propeller and similarly the thrusts of the fifth and eleventh propellers are the same case 3 shows that the control algorithm has good adaptability to the drastic change of sea conditions we have also carried out many other numerical tests not reported here for different wave conditions the control method performs well as expected 5 conclusion this paper presents a control method in conjunction with hinged connectors to suppress the heave roll and pitch motions of a modularized floating structure in random sea with hinged connectors proposed in control the deployment of control thrusters and the control scheme are greatly simplified and economic in comparison with existing methods it only requires to control the three motions of heave roll and pitch by using thrusters mounted vertically on each module resulting in overall motion mitigation a pd algorithm combined with an estimator of uncertain wave load built by the rbfnn neuron networks is developed sqp is employed to optimally distribute the thrust to each propeller numerical simulations show that the effectiveness of the control strategy the rbfnn estimator could track the uncertain load of the floating structure accurately and adaptively in this paper the control configuration is innovative and an adaptive neural network is firstly developed to estimate the uncertain load caused by wave and hinged connectors the systematic approach for motion mitigation could be a good reference for the stability control of marine structures credit authorship contribution statement shuyan xia

21481,magnus stabilizer is a novel device for anti rolling of ships which generates lift through a high speed rotating rotor rotor wing based on magnus effect the present work aims to investigate the influence of aspect ratios a s ratio of the length and the diameter on hydrodynamic characteristics with particular attention paid to the a s at maximum hydrodynamics lift drag hydrodynamics

along been working to reduce the rolling motion of ships and various anti rolling devices have been developed fin stabilizer is the most widely used anti rolling device for ships nowadays shown in fig 1 a its anti rolling effect can reach more than 90 at the design speed however the conventional fin restricted by its mechanism only has a good stabilization effect at high ship speed at lower ship speed about less than 11 kn to 14 kn it is difficult for it to generate sufficient lift to achieve efficient roll reduction since the flow passing through the fin surfaces is slow therefore the problem of the ship roll stabilization is difficult to be solved when the ship is in mooring state or sailing at a lower speed for special needs a general survey of existing stabilizers anti rolling tank holden et al 2011 youssef et al 2002 gawad et al 2001 moving weight ship stabilizer dreyfusi and brunsell 1971 or gyroscope tucker and levinson 2000 townsend et al 2007 that stabilize the ship s roll motion at low ship speed is really available but there are still some drawbacks for these devices such as large size poor anti rolling effects larger driving power or high cost liang et al 2017 it is worth mentioning the zero speed fin ooms 2002 wang et al 2009 2016 bib wang et al 2009 bib wang et al 2016 mao et al 2019 which enhance lift in a paddle mode to obtain reaction forces at zero speed the zero speed fin is with a low aspect ratio and an eccentric shaft position this geometry is a compromise with the optimum arrangement for transit conditions results in power consumption and reducing lift utilization more or less dallinga and papuc 2008 liang et al 2017 meanwhile the hydrodynamic characteristics on the zero speed fins is complicated the lift is no longer approximates the proportional characteristics with the fin angle these make it difficult to obtain operation variables directly making the system a varying rolling model the zero speed fin is more or less a conventional stabilizer fin dallinga and papuc 2008 as shown in fig 1 b the world s first magnus stabilizer was designed by theo koop in 1980 liang et al 2017 and the structure sketch is shown in fig 2 b the magnus stabilizer can be driven by hydraulic motors or electric motors fully electric magnus stabilizer is driven by a dc motor to rotate the rotor rapidly usually at a working speed of over 1000 rpm carbon fiber materials is generally chosen for rotor wing so its weight is relatively light the rotor wing has a greater lift coefficient than the fin which is the main reason for the development and utilization of the magnus stabilizer rotorswing stabilizer and maglift rotary stabilizer are shown in fig 1 c and d the mechanism of magnus stabilizer can be regarded as a typical hydrodynamic problem of flow past a rotating cylinder as shown in fig 2 a the ship is sailing straight forward at speed v and the rotor wing is in a uniform flow this is equivalent to the situation that the rotor wing remains motionless while the flow runs parallel from infinity past around it at speed v but the flow direction is opposite to the sailing direction when the ship disturbed by waves sea breeze or currents a roll motion is generated with the direction from the starboard to the port the starboard rotor wing rotates about on its axis clockwise viewed from free end to fixed end and produces downward lift f l when the rolling direction is changed the rotation direction of the rotor wing is also changed leading to an upward lift when the rotor wings are installed on both sides of the ship wall they run simultaneously under equal rotary speeds and the opposite directions then the lift on the two rotor wings produces a stabilizing torque in the counter direction relative to the rolling motion of the ship magnus stabilizer like the retractable fin anti rolling device can restore from the bottom of the ship to both sides of the hull and rotates under the commands from its control system when required when not needed it retracts along the direction of the flow and sticks against the bottom of the ship to reduce drag and speed loss the magnus effect is named after magnus 1852 for his first discovery and testification on the phenomenon that a rotating cylinder into a streaming fluid according to bernoulli s law for an object such as the rotor wing rotating in a viscous incompressible flow when the flow is in the same direction with the induced movement the pressure decreases while increases on the opposite side so it creates a pressure difference on both sides of the rotating rotor wing the magnus effect is an induced very high lift phenomenon morisseau 2010 in 1912 lafay 1912 studied the pressure difference produced by the magnus effect in a large number of experiments and concluded that the magnus force generated by the rotating cylinders is approximately twice the lift generated by the fins prandtl 1925 conducted a visualization study of the flow past rotating cylinders and indicated that the maximum lift coefficient was 4π he also pointed out that this lift coefficient is about ten times the value usually obtained by the aircraft wing kollenberger 1979 conducted that the lift coefficient of the rotor is about seven times that of the conventional fin some early researchers reid 1924 prandtl 1925 found that the aspect ratio and the rotating speed have a significant influence on the lift drag however the relationship between all variables is not clear and its application field is also uncertain in 1992 szepessy and bearman 1992 studied the effect of aspect ratio on the vortex shedding of non rotating rotor wing at high reynolds number by means of wind tunnel experiments he concluded that aspect ratio about 0 25 12 has the most effect on fluctuating lift within a certain range of reynolds number the increase of fluctuating lift can be obtained by reducing the aspect ratio when the aspect ratio is 1 the maximum value of fluctuating lift is almost twice that of the large aspect ratio however there was no change in the diameter in szepessy and bearman s 1992 experiments which only changed the aspect ratio by moving the end baffle and had ignored the effect of diameter change on the fluctuating lift in 1993 tokumaru and dimotakis 1993 experimentally measured the relationship between the average lift coefficient of the rotor wing with an aspect ratio of 18 7 his results showed that the lift coefficient increases with the raise of rotary speed the lift coefficient can exceed prandtl s limit compared with the results of prandtl 1925 he also concluded that when the inflow speed is constant the greater the aspect ratio is the greater the lift coefficient gets karabelas 2010 carried out a two dimensional simulation of a rotating rotor wing with les large eddy simulation for spin ratio defined as the ratio of the rotor wing s circumferential speed to the free stream speed α 2 and r e 140e3 the results showed that the lift coefficient increases almost linearly with the spin ratio while the drag coefficient decreases with the spin ratio because of the low spin ratio the result does not give a more complete development trend of lift drag coefficients chen and rheem 2018 carried out the experiments in the circulating water channel on a large spin ratio up to α 9 of rotor wings with the same length l 0 59 m and different diameters of 0 319 m 0 267 m 0 216 m and 0 102 m in the initial area the spin ratio is small the trends of lift drag coefficients is in line with the result of karabelas 2010 in the increasing area the lift and drag coefficients increase rapidly with the spin ratio in the equilibrium area they found that the greater the aspect ratio is the higher the rotary speed gets chen and rheem s 2018 experiments had a higher lift coefficient exceeding the prandtl s limit this may be due to the low inflow speed 0 3 m s 1 in the experiments and two co rotating end disks attached although some research results tokumaru and dimotakis 1993 chen and rheem 2018 showed that prandtl s limit can be exceeded the research results conforming to prandtl s limit persist such as the tests made in wind tunnel by reid 1924 even at high speeds of about 1800 rpm 3600 rpm the lift coefficient obtained does not exceed 4π chew et al 1995 computed the lift for α 6 at reynolds number r e 100 their results were in agreement with prandtl s postulate among of the previous studies on hydrodynamic characteristics of rotating rotor wings in flow more attention has been paid to the influence of spin ratio and r e on lift drag and the wake behind the rotor wing chen and rheem 2018 chang and chern 1991 zdravkovich 1989 less detailed studies have been made on the effects of aspect ratio on hydrodynamic characteristics of rotating rotor wings in flow szepessy and bearman 1992 used a constant diameter rotor while wieselsberger 1929 used a constant length few studies have been conducted on multiple lengths and diameters in addition most of the previous experimental studies focused on low speed conditions such as less than 600 rpm in chen and rheem 2018 experiments for a few experiments under high rotary speed conditions reid 1924 they are wind tunnel tests not in water in this paper the simulation study is different from any of the above due to the aims to find the optimum a s for magnus stabilizer more groups of 3 d simulations more than 400 groups are adopted to investigate the influence of aspect ratio on hydrodynamics of rotor wing 2 material and method 2 1 geometric model and computational grid the three dimensional numerical simulation was carried out used the commercial cfd software ansys the geometric model of the rotor wing in the flow field is established as shown in fig 3 the rotor wing is not placed at the geometric center of the flow field but installed close to the left wall which is equivalent to a ship hull the flow field size is b d high b d wide b l long in m where l is the length of the rotor wing and d is the diameter respectively considering related simulation experiments karabelas 2010 wang et al 2009 breuer 1998 the entire domain has a radial extension of 10 d and a spanwise extension of d and takes the computer capability and the calculation domain tests the extended length of calculation domain b is 5 m in this simulation the classical interface of ansys is used to build simulation model and mesh generation the 3 d mesh of the flow field around the rotor wing is shown in fig 3 the grid size is quite thin close to the rotor wing and it is capable of resolving most of the developed boundary layer the grid is refined in the near wall region of the rotor wing due to the complexity of the flow around the rotor wing take the mesh quality into consideration the first mesh spacing is 0 1e 3 m and the ratio of the mesh spacing is 1 1 the rotor wing is divided into layers every 0 1 m along the spanwise direction and total 100 parts in the circumferential direction the generated meshes are hexahedron with high orthogonality in fig 2 a the velocities of the flow around the rotor wing are set in u x v y and w z directions the front side of the flow field is the velocity inlet with uniform inflow the boundary conditions of the inlet are 1 u v v 0 w 0 the downstream of the rotor wing is the outlet of the computational domain and the boundary conditions of the outlet are 2 u x 0 v x 0 w x 0 the wall connected to the fixed end and the two ends are set as no slip wall i e the velocity of fluid flowing on the solid surface is equal to that of the solid surface the other three walls top bottom and right of the flow field are set as opening boundary condition i e both inflow and outflow are allowed how to apply rotary motion to the rotor wall firstly we treated the surface of the rotor wing as a moving boundary secondly the rotational motion was decomposed into components in three directions x y and z assume that the surface velocity of the rotor wing is 3 v n 2 n π r 60 where v n is surface velocity of the rotor wing n is the rotary speed respectively then the velocity of a point x y z on the surface of a rotor wing is 4 u x v n y x 2 y 2 v y v n x x 2 y 2 w z 0 finally we set the wall velocities of the boundary of the surface of the rotor wing as eq 4 the water around rotor wing is single phase flow the dynamic viscosity of the water is 8 9e 4 kg m 1 s 1 and the gravity is ignored the range of reynolds number in the simulations is from 1 02e5 to 1 64e6 according to the simulation parameters rng k ε turbulence model is adopted in the simulation calculation which is suitable for most engineering turbulence models li et al 2017 ahn et al 2018 especially for high reynolds numbers the numerical simulation is solved using pressure based first order upwind taking into account the computing speed of the computer and the previous tests on iterations the number of iteration steps is set as 200 and the step size adopts automatic time scale to validate the method for the simulation it is decided to conduct a separate study where numerical or experimental data are available fig 4 plots the hydrodynamics coefficients as a function of the spin ratio α the hydrodynamics coefficients in the present work agree well with the previous results in fig 4 a both our results and previous studies are very close to each other except karabelas s et al 2012 results the reason may be that karabelas used a two dimensional simulation method which could not reflect the actual hydrodynamic characteristics well in the problem of flow past a rotating cylinder however a discrepancy appears at medium spin ratios close to the value of 3 even under the same experimental conditions such as chen and rheem s 2018 results this is also can be found in the drag coefficients shown in fig 4 b we haven t figured out the reason of this phenomenon maybe the rotor size effect is more significant at higher spin ratio at present there is no clear expression about the relationship between the drag coefficient and spin ratio on rotating rotor wing in flow some scholars kang at el 1999 aoki and ito 2001 karabelas et al 2012 believe that the drag coefficient decreases with the increase of spin ratio but we tend to agree with chen and rheem 2018 and believe there are an initial area at small spin ratio and an increasing area at large spin ratio in the initial area as the spin ratio increases the drag coefficient decreases while in the increasing area it is the opposite as shown in fig 4 b 2 2 rotor wings in flow with a certain ship speed and rotary speed to understand the hydrodynamics that are generated on a rotating cylinder rotor wing in water a series of simulations were conducted at the ship speed v 7 kn and rotary speed n 1000 rpm for different rotor wings with a s in the range from 1 25 to 80 the relevant lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d are described as following 5 c l f l 1 2 ρ l d v 2 6 c d f d 1 2 ρ l d v 2 where f l and f d are the forces on the y and x the crossflow direction directions ρ is the seawater density and v is ship speed respectively the lift f l and lift coefficient c l obtained from the simulation are plotted in fig 5 a c in fig 5 a within a certain ship speed and rotary speed the lift is proportional to the aspect ratio at a given diameter in other words when the diameter of the rotor wing is certain the longer the rotor the greater the lift in fig 5 b the maximum lift appears this means that when the length of the rotor wing is certain larger diameter does not necessarily leading to larger lift in fig 5 c the trend of c l varying with a s can be divided into two parts the increasing area at small a s and the descending area at large a s the c l of increasing area increases linearly and rapidly with the increase of aspect ratio and then goes into the descending area after reaching a maximum value the maximum lift coefficient c l max of the rotor wings is about 5 56 9 93 however the lift coefficient of the naca fins is about 1 normally e g the lift coefficient of the naca0015 at 20 degrees of attack is about 1 09 according to eq 5 comparing with the lift coefficient of naca0015 under the same condition the projection area of the rotor wing is about 7 f r o t o r 1 9 1 5 f f i n where f r o t o r and f f i n are the projection areas of the rotor wing and the naca0015 respectively the rotor wing is therefore substantially more advantageous in respect of space than the fin without loss of generality the pressure contours and the streamlines of the rotor wings with different diameters are shown in fig 6 in fig 6 a and b the upper surface y direction of the rotor shows a high pressure region and the lower surface y direction shows a negative pressure region as the diameter of rotor wing increases the positive pressure region on the upside of the rotor wing moves to the ends since the two ends of the rotor wing are different the pressure distribution at both ends are not symmetrical which leads to the possibility that the pressure center of the rotor wing is not at the geometric center therefore the influence of pressure distribution should not be omitted when installing bearings from the streamline diagrams in fig 6 c when the rotary speed is certain the increase of the diameter of the rotor wing makes the streamlines converge due to the high rotary speed in this study there is no obvious periodic vortex shedding from the rotor wing the drag f d and drag coefficient c d obtained from the simulation are plotted in fig 7 a c within a certain ship speed and rotary speed the f d is proportional to a s at a given diameter as shown in fig 7 a in fig 7 b the drag decreases with the increase of aspect ratio and tends to be stable at large aspect ratio when the length of the rotor is certain the drag coefficient first increases then decreases with the increase of the as and finally tends to be stable at large as as shown in fig 7 c the maximum drag coefficient c d max of the rotor wings is about 2 75 4 08 and the drag coefficient of naca stabilizers is generally less than 0 5 obviously magnus stabilizer has a larger drag coefficient at present the rake function is adopted by rotorswing for reducing drag koop 2015 the focus of this article is not on drag reduction measures the lift drag ratio c l c d is an important parameter to assess the performance of the anti rolling device under the premise of obtaining enough lift the lift drag ratio of the anti rolling device is expected to be larger in fig 8 a the lift drag ratio reaches a peak at about 0 085 m in diameter then decreases with increasing diameter and eventually stabilizes from the simulation results the maximum lift drag ratio seems to be independent of the length of the rotor in fig 8 b the lift drag ratio increases almost linearly with the increase of aspect ratio at first and then decreases after reaching a peak at small aspect ratio the shorter the rotor length is the higher the lift drag ratio gets while oppositely in large aspect ratio 2 3 rotor wing in flow with ship speeds or rotary speeds changed one of the confusions related to lift drag characteristics on the rotor wing is how the lift drag changes with the rotary speed and ship speed to shed some light on this issue a series of 3 d simulation experiments are carried out on the rotor wing with the same length l 2 5 m but different diameters from 0 05 m to 0 8 m the speed of the incoming flow is equal to the speed of the ship but the direction is opposite taking into account the actual application conditions the rotary speed is between 1000 rpm and 1600 rpm the f l f d c l and c d are treated as absolute values in the simulation based on kutarukovsky s principle andré and anja 2011 8 f l ρ v l γ 9 γ 4 π 2 r 2 n 60 where ρ is the fluid density γ is the vortex of strength respectively obviously increasing the ship speed v or rotary speed n can make larger lift it is verified by the simulation results shown in fig 9 a and b in fig 9 c larger rotary speed yield larger maximum lift coefficients however due to the limitation of the wear of the sealing material the rotary speed n does not exceed 2000 rpm generally therefore the lift coefficient of the magnus stabilizer will not continue to increase an interesting phenomenon in the simulation results is that although the increase of ship speed will lead to a significant increase in lift the lift coefficient c l will decrease as shown in fig 9 c and d without loss of generality the pressure contours streamlines and velocity vector maps of the rotor wings for different ship speed and rotary speed are shown in figs 10 and 11 in fig 10 a due to the low rotary speed the high pressures zone is located on the upstream side of the rotor and the magnus lift on the rotor is not obvious as the increase of rotary speed magnus lift increases and the upper surface of the rotor wing presents a more uniform high pressure region when the rotary speed continues to increase the uneven distribution of the high pressure region on the upper surface of the rotor wing is formed in fig 10 b the streamlines behind in the rotor wing converge with the rotary speed increasing velocity vector maps at different rotary speeds are plotted in fig 10 c in fig 11 a and b when the ship speed is too low the streamlines behind the rotor wing are disordered and the uniform high pressure zone can t be formed on the upper surface of the rotor wing resulting in less lift with the increase of ship speed unevenly distributed high pressures zone is formed with a significant lift increasing increasing rotary speed will result in an increase in drag f d and drag coefficient c d see fig 12 a and b for a given rotary speed the drag increases as the ship speed increases but the drag coefficient decreases shown in fig 12 c and d both the drag and drag coefficient are sensitive to the rotary speed and ship speed in the small aspect ratio area but stabilized in the large aspect ratio area in fig 13 a and b the maximum lift drag ratio c l c d max is about 7 5 10 2 therefore when the appropriate aspect ratio is selected the difference in lift and drag is about an order of magnitude can be made in the aspect ratio range about 0 30 the c l c d increases with ship speed increasing but decreases with rotary speed increasing 3 results and discussion 3 1 the as at f l m a x c lmax c d m a x and c l c d m a x under a certain ship speed and rotary speed from the simulation results with the change of the aspect ratio the lift lift coefficient drag coefficient and lift drag ratio showed a maximum the a s at maximum lift f l max maximum lift coefficient c l max maximum drag coefficient c d max and maximum lift drag ratio c l c d max are expressed as a s f l max a s c l max a s c d max and a s ratio max respectively relationships of these aspect ratios to the lengths of the rotor wing are plotted in fig 14 a obviously the maximum lift maximum lift coefficient and maximum drag coefficient all appear at small aspect ratio about 2 22 8 42 and a s c l max a s c d max a s c l max a s f l max in addition a s f l max a s c l max and a s c d max increase slightly as the rotor wing length increased in fig 14 b from the curve fitting the rotor length at c l c d max l r a t i o max is linearly related to the a s at c l c d max that is 10 d r a t i o max l r a t i o max a s r a t i o max 0 088 m where d r a t i o max and a s r a t i o max are the diameter and a s of the rotor wing at c l c d max respectively 3 2 the as at f l m a x c lmax c d m a x and c l c d m a x with ship speeds or rotary speeds changed in this section we will discuss whether the a s at the maximum hydrodynamics f l max c l max c d max and c l c d max is affected by the ship speed or rotary speed as shown in fig 15 at a certain ship speed a s c l max and a s c d max do not change much with rotary speed but a s f l max increases with the increase of n significantly the a s c l max a s c d max and a s f l max concentrated in the small aspect ratio about 3 57 6 67 and a s c l max a s c d max see fig 15 a in fig 15 b at a certain rotary speed a s c l max decreases with the increase of ship speed and tends to stabilize finally in fig 8 a when the ship speed and rotary speed are constant v 7 kn n 1000 rpm the maximum lift drag ratio a s r a t i o max of the rotor wing appears at a specific diameter d r a t i o max 0 88 m will d r a t i o max be affected when the speed or speed changes from the simulation results d r a t i o max increases with ship speed increases and decreases with increasing rotary speed when the speed is from 2 kn to 14 kn d r a t i o max changes from 0 09 m to 0 1 m and d r a t i o max changes from 0 1 m to 0 085 m at rotary speed from 1000 rpm to 1600 rpm 3 3 selection of rotor size under the premise of safe installation the convenient fin is usually designed to have a larger lift while the drag is generally not considered as a major factor however the drag coefficient of the magnus stabilizer is significantly higher than that of the fin stabilizer therefore when choosing the size of the rotor we should not only consider obtaining greater lift but also attach importance to the influence of the drag to reduce energy loss whether there exists an optimal aspect ratio to make the lift larger and the drag smaller 1 the maximum lift is usually obtained at a smaller aspect ratio but accompanied by very high drag and a small lift drag ratio for example the lift f l max can reach 1 60e5 n on the 4 m long rotor wing but it is also accompanied by a large drag 0 85e5 n see figs 5 b and 7 b therefore the size at the maximum lift is not recommended as the rotor wing design size 2 the lift at the a s r a t i o max is very small even a 3 m long rotor wing the lift is less than 2000 n at a s r a t i o max as shown in figs 5 b and 8 b the lift cannot produce enough rolling moment to antiroll the ship so the size at a s r a t i o max is not recommended too 3 the f l at the c l max is shown in table 1 and table 2 obviously the lift generated on the rotor wing at a s c l max is plenty and the c l c d is not very low therefore with reference to the a s c l max and taking effects of lift drag ratio and lift increment into account the aspect ratio which meets the actual needs can be selected here the concept of lift increment f l in the magnitude of the increasement in f l per 100 rpm increasing expressing the energy conversion efficiency is proposed and plotted in fig 16 c the lift coefficient lift drag ratio and lift increment are presented as functions of the aspect ratio at different ship speeds i in kn expressed as f c l i a s f c l c d i a s and f l in a s respectively the fitting functions 11 to 13 are obtained by non linear fitting based on the simulation data see fig 16 a and b and the fitting parameters of 11 and 12 are shown in table 3 11 f c l i a s e a 1 b 1 a s c 1 a s 2 12 f c l c d i a s a 2 b 2 a s 13 f l in a s 36187

a s 1 where k i 1 7 1 7 2 7 1 7 1 14 1 14 λ 1 λ 2 and λ 3 are the weights of lift coefficient lift drag ratio and lift increment respectively the optimization results of aspect ratio are shown in fig 17 considering the rotary speed of 1000 rpm 1600 rpm and ship speed 2 kn to14 kn the a s 7 1 7 6 is found to be suitable for the rotor wing with length of 2 5 m that is to say the diameter of the rotor wing is between 0 328 m and 0 352 m the result consists with the size of the product provided by quantum control 4 conclusions two main significant issues are addressed in this paper the first is how the hydrodynamics varied with aspect ratio the other is whether the aspect ratios at maximum hydrodynamics influenced by the length of rotor wing and ship speed or rotary speed we concluded that 1 the aspect ratio is a key factor affecting the hydrodynamics of a rotating rotor wing in flow the small a s has a striking effect on the lift drag characteristics both the lift drag and the lift drag coefficients change drastically at small aspect ratio and stabilize at large aspect ratio 2 there is an a s that can make the lift lift coefficient and drag coefficient reach the peak however the a s at maximum hydrodynamics f l max c l max c d max does not keep constant and increases with the increase of the rotor length the maximum hydrodynamics on the rotor wing with the length of 1 4 m appear at the a s about 2 22 8 42 the aspect ratio at the maximum lift coefficient is larger than it at maximum drag coefficient and maximum lift 3 the a s at maximum lift drag ratio is seem to be independent of the length of the rotor wing but impacted by the ship speed and rotary speed a rotor with a diameter of 0 088 m produces a maximum lift drag ratio at a ship speed of 7 kn and a rotary speed of 1000 rpm 4 the aspect ratio at the maximum lift of the rotor wing is affected by rotary speed however the rotary speed effect on the aspect ratio at the maximum lift drag coefficients are not obviously maybe caused by the small range of speed change in the simulation 5 when the ship speed is less than 14 knots it is considered that the diameter in range of 0 328 m 0 352 m is suitable for the 2 5 m long rotor wing 6 magnus stabilizer has a larger lift coefficient than conventional fins but the drag coefficient is also larger seeking good drag reduction method is a research direction in the future finally the proposed simulation method has certain limitations such as ignoring the free surface effects caused by rolling motion and slightly rough mesh of the boundary layer

21481,magnus stabilizer is a novel device for anti rolling of ships which generates lift through a high speed rotating rotor rotor wing based on magnus effect the present work aims to investigate the influence of aspect ratios a s ratio of the length and the diameter on hydrodynamic characteristics with particular attention paid to the a s at maximum hydrodynamics lift drag hydrodynamics

along been working to reduce the rolling motion of ships and various anti rolling devices have been developed fin stabilizer is the most widely used anti rolling device for ships nowadays shown in fig 1 a its anti rolling effect can reach more than 90 at the design speed however the conventional fin restricted by its mechanism only has a good stabilization effect at high ship speed at lower ship speed about less than 11 kn to 14 kn it is difficult for it to generate sufficient lift to achieve efficient roll reduction since the flow passing through the fin surfaces is slow therefore the problem of the ship roll stabilization is difficult to be solved when the ship is in mooring state or sailing at a lower speed for special needs a general survey of existing stabilizers anti rolling tank holden et al 2011 youssef et al 2002 gawad et al 2001 moving weight ship stabilizer dreyfusi and brunsell 1971 or gyroscope tucker and levinson 2000 townsend et al 2007 that stabilize the ship s roll motion at low ship speed is really available but there are still some drawbacks for these devices such as large size poor anti rolling effects larger driving power or high cost liang et al 2017 it is worth mentioning the zero speed fin ooms 2002 wang et al 2009 2016 bib wang et al 2009 bib wang et al 2016 mao et al 2019 which enhance lift in a paddle mode to obtain reaction forces at zero speed the zero speed fin is with a low aspect ratio and an eccentric shaft position this geometry is a compromise with the optimum arrangement for transit conditions results in power consumption and reducing lift utilization more or less dallinga and papuc 2008 liang et al 2017 meanwhile the hydrodynamic characteristics on the zero speed fins is complicated the lift is no longer approximates the proportional characteristics with the fin angle these make it difficult to obtain operation variables directly making the system a varying rolling model the zero speed fin is more or less a conventional stabilizer fin dallinga and papuc 2008 as shown in fig 1 b the world s first magnus stabilizer was designed by theo koop in 1980 liang et al 2017 and the structure sketch is shown in fig 2 b the magnus stabilizer can be driven by hydraulic motors or electric motors fully electric magnus stabilizer is driven by a dc motor to rotate the rotor rapidly usually at a working speed of over 1000 rpm carbon fiber materials is generally chosen for rotor wing so its weight is relatively light the rotor wing has a greater lift coefficient than the fin which is the main reason for the development and utilization of the magnus stabilizer rotorswing stabilizer and maglift rotary stabilizer are shown in fig 1 c and d the mechanism of magnus stabilizer can be regarded as a typical hydrodynamic problem of flow past a rotating cylinder as shown in fig 2 a the ship is sailing straight forward at speed v and the rotor wing is in a uniform flow this is equivalent to the situation that the rotor wing remains motionless while the flow runs parallel from infinity past around it at speed v but the flow direction is opposite to the sailing direction when the ship disturbed by waves sea breeze or currents a roll motion is generated with the direction from the starboard to the port the starboard rotor wing rotates about on its axis clockwise viewed from free end to fixed end and produces downward lift f l when the rolling direction is changed the rotation direction of the rotor wing is also changed leading to an upward lift when the rotor wings are installed on both sides of the ship wall they run simultaneously under equal rotary speeds and the opposite directions then the lift on the two rotor wings produces a stabilizing torque in the counter direction relative to the rolling motion of the ship magnus stabilizer like the retractable fin anti rolling device can restore from the bottom of the ship to both sides of the hull and rotates under the commands from its control system when required when not needed it retracts along the direction of the flow and sticks against the bottom of the ship to reduce drag and speed loss the magnus effect is named after magnus 1852 for his first discovery and testification on the phenomenon that a rotating cylinder into a streaming fluid according to bernoulli s law for an object such as the rotor wing rotating in a viscous incompressible flow when the flow is in the same direction with the induced movement the pressure decreases while increases on the opposite side so it creates a pressure difference on both sides of the rotating rotor wing the magnus effect is an induced very high lift phenomenon morisseau 2010 in 1912 lafay 1912 studied the pressure difference produced by the magnus effect in a large number of experiments and concluded that the magnus force generated by the rotating cylinders is approximately twice the lift generated by the fins prandtl 1925 conducted a visualization study of the flow past rotating cylinders and indicated that the maximum lift coefficient was 4π he also pointed out that this lift coefficient is about ten times the value usually obtained by the aircraft wing kollenberger 1979 conducted that the lift coefficient of the rotor is about seven times that of the conventional fin some early researchers reid 1924 prandtl 1925 found that the aspect ratio and the rotating speed have a significant influence on the lift drag however the relationship between all variables is not clear and its application field is also uncertain in 1992 szepessy and bearman 1992 studied the effect of aspect ratio on the vortex shedding of non rotating rotor wing at high reynolds number by means of wind tunnel experiments he concluded that aspect ratio about 0 25 12 has the most effect on fluctuating lift within a certain range of reynolds number the increase of fluctuating lift can be obtained by reducing the aspect ratio when the aspect ratio is 1 the maximum value of fluctuating lift is almost twice that of the large aspect ratio however there was no change in the diameter in szepessy and bearman s 1992 experiments which only changed the aspect ratio by moving the end baffle and had ignored the effect of diameter change on the fluctuating lift in 1993 tokumaru and dimotakis 1993 experimentally measured the relationship between the average lift coefficient of the rotor wing with an aspect ratio of 18 7 his results showed that the lift coefficient increases with the raise of rotary speed the lift coefficient can exceed prandtl s limit compared with the results of prandtl 1925 he also concluded that when the inflow speed is constant the greater the aspect ratio is the greater the lift coefficient gets karabelas 2010 carried out a two dimensional simulation of a rotating rotor wing with les large eddy simulation for spin ratio defined as the ratio of the rotor wing s circumferential speed to the free stream speed α 2 and r e 140e3 the results showed that the lift coefficient increases almost linearly with the spin ratio while the drag coefficient decreases with the spin ratio because of the low spin ratio the result does not give a more complete development trend of lift drag coefficients chen and rheem 2018 carried out the experiments in the circulating water channel on a large spin ratio up to α 9 of rotor wings with the same length l 0 59 m and different diameters of 0 319 m 0 267 m 0 216 m and 0 102 m in the initial area the spin ratio is small the trends of lift drag coefficients is in line with the result of karabelas 2010 in the increasing area the lift and drag coefficients increase rapidly with the spin ratio in the equilibrium area they found that the greater the aspect ratio is the higher the rotary speed gets chen and rheem s 2018 experiments had a higher lift coefficient exceeding the prandtl s limit this may be due to the low inflow speed 0 3 m s 1 in the experiments and two co rotating end disks attached although some research results tokumaru and dimotakis 1993 chen and rheem 2018 showed that prandtl s limit can be exceeded the research results conforming to prandtl s limit persist such as the tests made in wind tunnel by reid 1924 even at high speeds of about 1800 rpm 3600 rpm the lift coefficient obtained does not exceed 4π chew et al 1995 computed the lift for α 6 at reynolds number r e 100 their results were in agreement with prandtl s postulate among of the previous studies on hydrodynamic characteristics of rotating rotor wings in flow more attention has been paid to the influence of spin ratio and r e on lift drag and the wake behind the rotor wing chen and rheem 2018 chang and chern 1991 zdravkovich 1989 less detailed studies have been made on the effects of aspect ratio on hydrodynamic characteristics of rotating rotor wings in flow szepessy and bearman 1992 used a constant diameter rotor while wieselsberger 1929 used a constant length few studies have been conducted on multiple lengths and diameters in addition most of the previous experimental studies focused on low speed conditions such as less than 600 rpm in chen and rheem 2018 experiments for a few experiments under high rotary speed conditions reid 1924 they are wind tunnel tests not in water in this paper the simulation study is different from any of the above due to the aims to find the optimum a s for magnus stabilizer more groups of 3 d simulations more than 400 groups are adopted to investigate the influence of aspect ratio on hydrodynamics of rotor wing 2 material and method 2 1 geometric model and computational grid the three dimensional numerical simulation was carried out used the commercial cfd software ansys the geometric model of the rotor wing in the flow field is established as shown in fig 3 the rotor wing is not placed at the geometric center of the flow field but installed close to the left wall which is equivalent to a ship hull the flow field size is b d high b d wide b l long in m where l is the length of the rotor wing and d is the diameter respectively considering related simulation experiments karabelas 2010 wang et al 2009 breuer 1998 the entire domain has a radial extension of 10 d and a spanwise extension of d and takes the computer capability and the calculation domain tests the extended length of calculation domain b is 5 m in this simulation the classical interface of ansys is used to build simulation model and mesh generation the 3 d mesh of the flow field around the rotor wing is shown in fig 3 the grid size is quite thin close to the rotor wing and it is capable of resolving most of the developed boundary layer the grid is refined in the near wall region of the rotor wing due to the complexity of the flow around the rotor wing take the mesh quality into consideration the first mesh spacing is 0 1e 3 m and the ratio of the mesh spacing is 1 1 the rotor wing is divided into layers every 0 1 m along the spanwise direction and total 100 parts in the circumferential direction the generated meshes are hexahedron with high orthogonality in fig 2 a the velocities of the flow around the rotor wing are set in u x v y and w z directions the front side of the flow field is the velocity inlet with uniform inflow the boundary conditions of the inlet are 1 u v v 0 w 0 the downstream of the rotor wing is the outlet of the computational domain and the boundary conditions of the outlet are 2 u x 0 v x 0 w x 0 the wall connected to the fixed end and the two ends are set as no slip wall i e the velocity of fluid flowing on the solid surface is equal to that of the solid surface the other three walls top bottom and right of the flow field are set as opening boundary condition i e both inflow and outflow are allowed how to apply rotary motion to the rotor wall firstly we treated the surface of the rotor wing as a moving boundary secondly the rotational motion was decomposed into components in three directions x y and z assume that the surface velocity of the rotor wing is 3 v n 2 n π r 60 where v n is surface velocity of the rotor wing n is the rotary speed respectively then the velocity of a point x y z on the surface of a rotor wing is 4 u x v n y x 2 y 2 v y v n x x 2 y 2 w z 0 finally we set the wall velocities of the boundary of the surface of the rotor wing as eq 4 the water around rotor wing is single phase flow the dynamic viscosity of the water is 8 9e 4 kg m 1 s 1 and the gravity is ignored the range of reynolds number in the simulations is from 1 02e5 to 1 64e6 according to the simulation parameters rng k ε turbulence model is adopted in the simulation calculation which is suitable for most engineering turbulence models li et al 2017 ahn et al 2018 especially for high reynolds numbers the numerical simulation is solved using pressure based first order upwind taking into account the computing speed of the computer and the previous tests on iterations the number of iteration steps is set as 200 and the step size adopts automatic time scale to validate the method for the simulation it is decided to conduct a separate study where numerical or experimental data are available fig 4 plots the hydrodynamics coefficients as a function of the spin ratio α the hydrodynamics coefficients in the present work agree well with the previous results in fig 4 a both our results and previous studies are very close to each other except karabelas s et al 2012 results the reason may be that karabelas used a two dimensional simulation method which could not reflect the actual hydrodynamic characteristics well in the problem of flow past a rotating cylinder however a discrepancy appears at medium spin ratios close to the value of 3 even under the same experimental conditions such as chen and rheem s 2018 results this is also can be found in the drag coefficients shown in fig 4 b we haven t figured out the reason of this phenomenon maybe the rotor size effect is more significant at higher spin ratio at present there is no clear expression about the relationship between the drag coefficient and spin ratio on rotating rotor wing in flow some scholars kang at el 1999 aoki and ito 2001 karabelas et al 2012 believe that the drag coefficient decreases with the increase of spin ratio but we tend to agree with chen and rheem 2018 and believe there are an initial area at small spin ratio and an increasing area at large spin ratio in the initial area as the spin ratio increases the drag coefficient decreases while in the increasing area it is the opposite as shown in fig 4 b 2 2 rotor wings in flow with a certain ship speed and rotary speed to understand the hydrodynamics that are generated on a rotating cylinder rotor wing in water a series of simulations were conducted at the ship speed v 7 kn and rotary speed n 1000 rpm for different rotor wings with a s in the range from 1 25 to 80 the relevant lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d are described as following 5 c l f l 1 2 ρ l d v 2 6 c d f d 1 2 ρ l d v 2 where f l and f d are the forces on the y and x the crossflow direction directions ρ is the seawater density and v is ship speed respectively the lift f l and lift coefficient c l obtained from the simulation are plotted in fig 5 a c in fig 5 a within a certain ship speed and rotary speed the lift is proportional to the aspect ratio at a given diameter in other words when the diameter of the rotor wing is certain the longer the rotor the greater the lift in fig 5 b the maximum lift appears this means that when the length of the rotor wing is certain larger diameter does not necessarily leading to larger lift in fig 5 c the trend of c l varying with a s can be divided into two parts the increasing area at small a s and the descending area at large a s the c l of increasing area increases linearly and rapidly with the increase of aspect ratio and then goes into the descending area after reaching a maximum value the maximum lift coefficient c l max of the rotor wings is about 5 56 9 93 however the lift coefficient of the naca fins is about 1 normally e g the lift coefficient of the naca0015 at 20 degrees of attack is about 1 09 according to eq 5 comparing with the lift coefficient of naca0015 under the same condition the projection area of the rotor wing is about 7 f r o t o r 1 9 1 5 f f i n where f r o t o r and f f i n are the projection areas of the rotor wing and the naca0015 respectively the rotor wing is therefore substantially more advantageous in respect of space than the fin without loss of generality the pressure contours and the streamlines of the rotor wings with different diameters are shown in fig 6 in fig 6 a and b the upper surface y direction of the rotor shows a high pressure region and the lower surface y direction shows a negative pressure region as the diameter of rotor wing increases the positive pressure region on the upside of the rotor wing moves to the ends since the two ends of the rotor wing are different the pressure distribution at both ends are not symmetrical which leads to the possibility that the pressure center of the rotor wing is not at the geometric center therefore the influence of pressure distribution should not be omitted when installing bearings from the streamline diagrams in fig 6 c when the rotary speed is certain the increase of the diameter of the rotor wing makes the streamlines converge due to the high rotary speed in this study there is no obvious periodic vortex shedding from the rotor wing the drag f d and drag coefficient c d obtained from the simulation are plotted in fig 7 a c within a certain ship speed and rotary speed the f d is proportional to a s at a given diameter as shown in fig 7 a in fig 7 b the drag decreases with the increase of aspect ratio and tends to be stable at large aspect ratio when the length of the rotor is certain the drag coefficient first increases then decreases with the increase of the as and finally tends to be stable at large as as shown in fig 7 c the maximum drag coefficient c d max of the rotor wings is about 2 75 4 08 and the drag coefficient of naca stabilizers is generally less than 0 5 obviously magnus stabilizer has a larger drag coefficient at present the rake function is adopted by rotorswing for reducing drag koop 2015 the focus of this article is not on drag reduction measures the lift drag ratio c l c d is an important parameter to assess the performance of the anti rolling device under the premise of obtaining enough lift the lift drag ratio of the anti rolling device is expected to be larger in fig 8 a the lift drag ratio reaches a peak at about 0 085 m in diameter then decreases with increasing diameter and eventually stabilizes from the simulation results the maximum lift drag ratio seems to be independent of the length of the rotor in fig 8 b the lift drag ratio increases almost linearly with the increase of aspect ratio at first and then decreases after reaching a peak at small aspect ratio the shorter the rotor length is the higher the lift drag ratio gets while oppositely in large aspect ratio 2 3 rotor wing in flow with ship speeds or rotary speeds changed one of the confusions related to lift drag characteristics on the rotor wing is how the lift drag changes with the rotary speed and ship speed to shed some light on this issue a series of 3 d simulation experiments are carried out on the rotor wing with the same length l 2 5 m but different diameters from 0 05 m to 0 8 m the speed of the incoming flow is equal to the speed of the ship but the direction is opposite taking into account the actual application conditions the rotary speed is between 1000 rpm and 1600 rpm the f l f d c l and c d are treated as absolute values in the simulation based on kutarukovsky s principle andré and anja 2011 8 f l ρ v l γ 9 γ 4 π 2 r 2 n 60 where ρ is the fluid density γ is the vortex of strength respectively obviously increasing the ship speed v or rotary speed n can make larger lift it is verified by the simulation results shown in fig 9 a and b in fig 9 c larger rotary speed yield larger maximum lift coefficients however due to the limitation of the wear of the sealing material the rotary speed n does not exceed 2000 rpm generally therefore the lift coefficient of the magnus stabilizer will not continue to increase an interesting phenomenon in the simulation results is that although the increase of ship speed will lead to a significant increase in lift the lift coefficient c l will decrease as shown in fig 9 c and d without loss of generality the pressure contours streamlines and velocity vector maps of the rotor wings for different ship speed and rotary speed are shown in figs 10 and 11 in fig 10 a due to the low rotary speed the high pressures zone is located on the upstream side of the rotor and the magnus lift on the rotor is not obvious as the increase of rotary speed magnus lift increases and the upper surface of the rotor wing presents a more uniform high pressure region when the rotary speed continues to increase the uneven distribution of the high pressure region on the upper surface of the rotor wing is formed in fig 10 b the streamlines behind in the rotor wing converge with the rotary speed increasing velocity vector maps at different rotary speeds are plotted in fig 10 c in fig 11 a and b when the ship speed is too low the streamlines behind the rotor wing are disordered and the uniform high pressure zone can t be formed on the upper surface of the rotor wing resulting in less lift with the increase of ship speed unevenly distributed high pressures zone is formed with a significant lift increasing increasing rotary speed will result in an increase in drag f d and drag coefficient c d see fig 12 a and b for a given rotary speed the drag increases as the ship speed increases but the drag coefficient decreases shown in fig 12 c and d both the drag and drag coefficient are sensitive to the rotary speed and ship speed in the small aspect ratio area but stabilized in the large aspect ratio area in fig 13 a and b the maximum lift drag ratio c l c d max is about 7 5 10 2 therefore when the appropriate aspect ratio is selected the difference in lift and drag is about an order of magnitude can be made in the aspect ratio range about 0 30 the c l c d increases with ship speed increasing but decreases with rotary speed increasing 3 results and discussion 3 1 the as at f l m a x c lmax c d m a x and c l c d m a x under a certain ship speed and rotary speed from the simulation results with the change of the aspect ratio the lift lift coefficient drag coefficient and lift drag ratio showed a maximum the a s at maximum lift f l max maximum lift coefficient c l max maximum drag coefficient c d max and maximum lift drag ratio c l c d max are expressed as a s f l max a s c l max a s c d max and a s ratio max respectively relationships of these aspect ratios to the lengths of the rotor wing are plotted in fig 14 a obviously the maximum lift maximum lift coefficient and maximum drag coefficient all appear at small aspect ratio about 2 22 8 42 and a s c l max a s c d max a s c l max a s f l max in addition a s f l max a s c l max and a s c d max increase slightly as the rotor wing length increased in fig 14 b from the curve fitting the rotor length at c l c d max l r a t i o max is linearly related to the a s at c l c d max that is 10 d r a t i o max l r a t i o max a s r a t i o max 0 088 m where d r a t i o max and a s r a t i o max are the diameter and a s of the rotor wing at c l c d max respectively 3 2 the as at f l m a x c lmax c d m a x and c l c d m a x with ship speeds or rotary speeds changed in this section we will discuss whether the a s at the maximum hydrodynamics f l max c l max c d max and c l c d max is affected by the ship speed or rotary speed as shown in fig 15 at a certain ship speed a s c l max and a s c d max do not change much with rotary speed but a s f l max increases with the increase of n significantly the a s c l max a s c d max and a s f l max concentrated in the small aspect ratio about 3 57 6 67 and a s c l max a s c d max see fig 15 a in fig 15 b at a certain rotary speed a s c l max decreases with the increase of ship speed and tends to stabilize finally in fig 8 a when the ship speed and rotary speed are constant v 7 kn n 1000 rpm the maximum lift drag ratio a s r a t i o max of the rotor wing appears at a specific diameter d r a t i o max 0 88 m will d r a t i o max be affected when the speed or speed changes from the simulation results d r a t i o max increases with ship speed increases and decreases with increasing rotary speed when the speed is from 2 kn to 14 kn d r a t i o max changes from 0 09 m to 0 1 m and d r a t i o max changes from 0 1 m to 0 085 m at rotary speed from 1000 rpm to 1600 rpm 3 3 selection of rotor size under the premise of safe installation the convenient fin is usually designed to have a larger lift while the drag is generally not considered as a major factor however the drag coefficient of the magnus stabilizer is significantly higher than that of the fin stabilizer therefore when choosing the size of the rotor we should not only consider obtaining greater lift but also attach importance to the influence of the drag to reduce energy loss whether there exists an optimal aspect ratio to make the lift larger and the drag smaller 1 the maximum lift is usually obtained at a smaller aspect ratio but accompanied by very high drag and a small lift drag ratio for example the lift f l max can reach 1 60e5 n on the 4 m long rotor wing but it is also accompanied by a large drag 0 85e5 n see figs 5 b and 7 b therefore the size at the maximum lift is not recommended as the rotor wing design size 2 the lift at the a s r a t i o max is very small even a 3 m long rotor wing the lift is less than 2000 n at a s r a t i o max as shown in figs 5 b and 8 b the lift cannot produce enough rolling moment to antiroll the ship so the size at a s r a t i o max is not recommended too 3 the f l at the c l max is shown in table 1 and table 2 obviously the lift generated on the rotor wing at a s c l max is plenty and the c l c d is not very low therefore with reference to the a s c l max and taking effects of lift drag ratio and lift increment into account the aspect ratio which meets the actual needs can be selected here the concept of lift increment f l in the magnitude of the increasement in f l per 100 rpm increasing expressing the energy conversion efficiency is proposed and plotted in fig 16 c the lift coefficient lift drag ratio and lift increment are presented as functions of the aspect ratio at different ship speeds i in kn expressed as f c l i a s f c l c d i a s and f l in a s respectively the fitting functions 11 to 13 are obtained by non linear fitting based on the simulation data see fig 16 a and b and the fitting parameters of 11 and 12 are shown in table 3 11 f c l i a s e a 1 b 1 a s c 1 a s 2 12 f c l c d i a s a 2 b 2 a s 13 f l in a s 36187 77 13971 76 1705 17 a s 2 67 10 a s 3 where subscript i 2 4 7 10 12 13 14 and a s is from 5 00 to 9 09 the objective function of the optimization is set as follows 14 f a s max a s z λ 1 f c l a s λ 2 f c l c d a s λ 3 f l i f t in a s s t 5 a s 9 09 15 f c l a s i 2 14 k i f c l i a s f c l i a s 1 16 f c l c d a s i 2 14 k i f c l c d i a s f c l c d i a s 1 17 f l i f t in a s f l in a s f l in a s 1 where k i 1 7 1 7 2 7 1 7 1 14 1 14 λ 1 λ 2 and λ 3 are the weights of lift coefficient lift drag ratio and lift increment respectively the optimization results of aspect ratio are shown in fig 17 considering the rotary speed of 1000 rpm 1600 rpm and ship speed 2 kn to14 kn the a s 7 1 7 6 is found to be suitable for the rotor wing with length of 2 5 m that is to say the diameter of the rotor wing is between 0 328 m and 0 352 m the result consists with the size of the product provided by quantum control 4 conclusions two main significant issues are addressed in this paper the first is how the hydrodynamics varied with aspect ratio the other is whether the aspect ratios at maximum hydrodynamics influenced by the length of rotor wing and ship speed or rotary speed we concluded that 1 the aspect ratio is a key factor affecting the hydrodynamics of a rotating rotor wing in flow the small a s has a striking effect on the lift drag characteristics both the lift drag and the lift drag coefficients change drastically at small aspect ratio and stabilize at large aspect ratio 2 there is an a s that can make the lift lift coefficient and drag coefficient reach the peak however the a s at maximum hydrodynamics f l max c l max c d max does not keep constant and increases with the increase of the rotor length the maximum hydrodynamics on the rotor wing with the length of 1 4 m appear at the a s about 2 22 8 42 the aspect ratio at the maximum lift coefficient is larger than it at maximum drag coefficient and maximum lift 3 the a s at maximum lift drag ratio is seem to be independent of the length of the rotor wing but impacted by the ship speed and rotary speed a rotor with a diameter of 0 088 m produces a maximum lift drag ratio at a ship speed of 7 kn and a rotary speed of 1000 rpm 4 the aspect ratio at the maximum lift of the rotor wing is affected by rotary speed however the rotary speed effect on the aspect ratio at the maximum lift drag coefficients are not obviously maybe caused by the small range of speed change in the simulation 5 when the ship speed is less than 14 knots it is considered that the diameter in range of 0 328 m 0 352 m is suitable for the 2 5 m long rotor wing 6 magnus stabilizer has a larger lift coefficient than conventional fins but the drag coefficient is also larger seeking good drag reduction method is a research direction in the future finally the proposed simulation method has certain limitations such as ignoring the free surface effects caused by rolling motion and slightly rough mesh of the boundary layer

global path planning multi objective path control unmanned surface vehicle chaotic and sharing learning particle swarm optimization currents 1 introduction with the features of coordinated cooperation intelligent autonomy and advanced operation usv has been applied and studied widely in navigation patrolling mousazadeh et al 2018 formation control peng et al 2019 liu et al 2016 and intelligent collision avoidance shi et al 2019 song et al 2017 especially in maritime operations han et al 2019 the usv can carry out dangerous tasks beyond the limits of human physiology and usv has some autonomous functions such as accurate strike cyclical operations self destruction and rapid evacuation thereby reducing the need for personnel and logistical support to accomplish tasks more effectively path planning and path control have played an important role and attracted tremendous attention in industrial application and scientific research for usv in recent years natural heuristic algorithms have achieved a lot of generous achievements in path research the solving algorithms are roughly classified as classical accurate algorithms and biological heuristic algorithms with its rigid procedures accurate algorithms can achieve an optimal solution if the one exists whereas heuristic algorithms can obtain the solution when accurate algorithms lose effectiveness particle swarm optimization pso genetic algorithm ga ant colony algorithm ac and artificial fish swarm algorithm afsa belong to the biological heuristic algorithms the pso algorithm has the merits of simple operation easy implementation and population based evolutionary ability fernandez martinez et al 2011 meanwhile the pso algorithm has been developed for nearly twenty years and has made considerable progress in solving complex optimization problems ramet al 2016 mistry et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 especially pso based path problems have been developed rapidly for example an improved pso was proposed to solve the multi objective the shortest and safest path for the robot gong et al 2013 an improved pso was applied to multi objective path planning with the shortest distance and the smoothest path in the literature mac et al 2017 wu 2019 combined pso algorithm to study coordinated path planning and target strike for unmanned aerial aquatic vehicle and autonomous underwater vehicle shao et al 2019 proposed path planning for an unmanned aerial vehicle with multi objective linear summation based on an improved pso das et al 2016 presented an improved pso and gravitational search algorithm

performance guarantees for usvs dong et al 2020 proposed neural network based adaptive output feedback formation tracking control of usvs under collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance constraints he et al 2019 researched leader follower formation control of usvs with prescribed performance and collision avoidance moreover there are many other well performing algorithms for path planning with the marine environment such as q learning for smart ships path planning chen et al 2019 a approach towards optimal path planning for an unmanned surface vehicle singh et al 2018 multi layered fast marching method for unmanned surface vehicle path planning in a time variant maritime environment song et al 2017 dijkstra search and energy consumption function are combined to solve path planning niu et al 2018 the ga algorithm solved path planning for autonomous underwater vehicles in a variable ocean alvarez et al 2004 to sum up it could be observed that several previous studies focused on optimizing one or two goals simultaneously and rarely took note of the global path planning and path control with joint optimization of five goals however the paper not only proposes a novel path planning method and path control with multi objective constraints but also provides two level collision avoidance rules the impact of currents and effectively improve the pso algorithm thus the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows i we maximize the profit per unit time for the travelling salesman problem to establish a global path planning model the goal of which is to get the global shortest path for usv with multiple task points ii between two task locations the path control models are established with five objective constraints including path distance smoothness stranding risk economic cost and safety in addition the effects of currents are also considered in our study iii according to the characteristics of the models the cspso algorithm is introduced to solve the global path planning and multi objective path control furthermore if the obstacle navigates without following the colregs convention the two level dynamic avoidance rules are applied to avoid an obstacle a novel path planning method is proposed to address the challenges of a two stage path plan and collision avoidance moreover numerical simulations and experiments verify that the proposed planning method and cspso algorithm are effective 2 problem formulation in this paper the usv navigation method is divided into two stages the first stage is the global path planning usv passes through all task points once and returns to the starting point which is described in fig 1 a in general the shorter path distance means lower cost which can increase profit in unit time the second stage is the path control usv avoids obstacle with the multi objective constraints and makes full use of currents direction between two task points as shown in fig 1 b 2 1 usv global path planning in this section a new version of the travelling salesman problem model is introduced for usv global path planning liu et al 2018 in which the goal is to maximize the profit per unit time when the travel time is resource dependent usv is assumed to be a salesman who is required to visit n cities the variable parameters are defined as follows g v e is a complete graph where v is the set of vertex representing the n cities each pair of vertex i and j is connected by edge i j t i j and s i j mean the time and cost for travel from i to j t and c mean the total travel time and the total travel cost r means the total travel revenue p means the profit per unit time x i j is a binary decision variable that can be defined as value 1 if the salesman travels from i to j otherwise x i j 0 the total travel cost is c the net profit is r c here the maximum net profit equals the minimum total cost which corresponds to the classical tsp model suppose that the net profit is non negative the total travel time is t i 1 n j n t i j x i j the total travel cost is c i 1 n j n s i j x i j therefore the profit per unit time is p r c t r i 1 n j n s i j x i j i 1 n j n t i j x i j the purpose of the travel is to maximize p which subjects to the following classical tsp constraints 1 each vertex must be visited exactly once 2 no sub tours are allowed combined above research global path planning based on the tsp model is established as follows 1 m a x p r i 1 n j n s i j x i j i 1 n j n t i j x i j 1a s t j 1 n x i j 1 i 1 n 1b i 1 n x i j 1 j 1 n 1c x i j 0 1 i 1 n j 1 n constraints 1a and 1b ensure that all vertexes are visited exactly once equation 1 enables the usv to obtain the maximum profit or the shortest global path scheme 2 2 multi objective path control for usv the path control of usv integrates five objective constraints including path distance smoothness stranding risk economic cost and safety risk 2 2 1 the shortest path distance generally the shortest path distance can save work time and energy which can enable usv to accomplish the task quickly the distance objective function j 1 is defined as 2 j 1 l m i n i 1 m x i 1 x i 2 y i 1 y i 2 where path l is composed by several sequential line segments x i i 1 m from starting point x i 1 y to destination x i y i in cartesian coordinates 2 2 2 the smoothest path a smooth path can reduce turning vibration and strengthen maneuverability which can enable usv to move smoothly and stably the smoothness path objective function j 2 can be defined as 3 j 2 m i n i 1 m θ i 1 m a t a n 2 y i 1 y i x i 1 x i a t a n 2 y i y i 1 x i x i 1 where θ is steering angle x i 1 y i 1 x i y i and x i 1 y i 1 are the three vertexes of the steering angle atan2 is four quadrant arc tangent 2 2 3 the minimum stranding risk path during the usv navigation the computation center can obtain underwater depth contour images with radar and visual systems in fig 2 a fig 2 b is grayed out to fig 2 c as follows the grayscale objective function j 3 is defined as 4 j 3 m a x i 1 m a g r a y s c a l e i in the figure different colors and brightness can show different gray levels the grayscale range is from 0 to 255 the smaller the grayscale for the figure the more likely it is to be stranded for usv 2 2 4 the safest path the usv can pass through the navigable territory without any collision the safety objective function j 4 is defined as 5 j 4 m i n j 1 m d s a f e 1 d r j d s a f e min j 0 d r j d s a f e max j d r j d s a f e min j d s a f e max j d s a f e min j o t h e r where d r j d safe minj and d safe maxj represent the real distance least distance and the lower limit of the maximum distance between the usv and obstacle respectively the smaller d safe value the safer the path usv can safely avoid obstacles 2 2 5 the minimal economic cost path the minimal economic cost means minimal energy consumption which enables usv to accomplish more ocean tasks the cost objective function j 5 is defined as 6 j 5 min e i 1 m t w where e is energy consumption the cost e is defined as the travel time t multiplied by the engine power w of the unit time to save energy not only does the usv get a shorter path but also moves along the direction of currents 2 3 usv collision avoidance in two situations in this section collision avoidance method from song et al 2018 is used to this paper fig 3 shows the motion state of usv and moving obstacle where v r and v o represent the velocity of usv and moving obstacle respectively d and d are the identification zone of usv and obstacle u and o represent usv and obstacle respectively the state of the usv can be defined as follows 1 d d ø is a safe state that the obstacle does not enter the identification zone of the usv 2 d d ø is a dangerous situation that the usv and obstacle have overlapped 2 3 1 general emergency according to the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs cheng et al 2018 three kinds of steering situations are discussed in fig 4 a song et al 2018 in fig 4 the usv generates a collision avoidance trajectory and angle division in three situations the δ θ is a navigation angle between the usv and the moving obstacle the three collision avoidance rules are shown below situation1 overtaking usv and obstacle sail in the same direction if the δ θ satisfies 30 90 in the horizontal direction the situation is dangerous and defined as an overtaking moving obstacle maintains the original route then the usv can accelerate and pass the obstacle from its port side cheng et al 2018 situation2 head on usv and obstacle sail towards each other if the δ θ satisfies 0 30 the situation is more dangerous than overtaking and it is defined as head on the moving obstacle turns to the right and passes through the left side of the usv usv will move to the right and pass from the left side of the obstacle or they will collide in addition usv always keeps a safe distance from the obstacle situation3 crossing the movement of usv and obstacle are shown in fig 4 if the δ θ satisfies 90 120 the situation is also dangerous and it is defined as a crossing moving obstacle maintains the original route then usv moves to the back of the obstacle or usv stops accelerating and keeps waiting according to colregs there are three ways to avoid a collision however the obstacle does not follow the colregs and moves to the usv usv can carry out collision avoidance operation by the following method we can judge the collision probability by changing the angle and speed of the usv the speed and angle parameters of usv and obstacle are shown in fig 5 song et al 2018 in fig 5 u and o represent the usv and the obstacle respectively v u a is the speed and angle of the usv v o β is the speed and angle of the obstacle δv and δa represent speed change and angle change of usv which should be adjusted for collision avoidance γ is the yaw angle to ensure usv to avoid collision μ is an angle that usv turns to the maximum safety distance point of o ut 1 and ut 2 represent two tangents from u to the domain of the o other parameters a x v u β x v o θ x uo γ uo δv ϕ δv v u μ uo ut in fig 5 if γ μ it is impossible for the usv to collide with an obstacle variables v u v o and δv constitute the velocity vector triangle fiorini and shiller 1998 7 v o sin α β δ v sin φ v u v o cos α β δ v cos φ v u 2 v o 2 2 v u v o cos α β δ v 2 v u sin β α δ v sin η v o v u cos β α δ v cos η 8 γ tan 1 v u sin a θ v o sin β θ v u cos a θ v o cos β θ if the velocity vector δv is between the two lines ut1 and ut2 the usv needs to avoid the obstacle tam et al 2013 this is defined as a non emergency situation and can be written as γ μ then we take the derivative of 8 9 d γ sin φ δ v d v u v u cos φ δ v d a sin η δ v d v o v o cos η δ v d β where the obstacle speed v o angle β δγ is the change of γ and δγ can be altered by adjusting the speed v u and the angle a of usv δv and δa represent speed and angle change of usv according to security regulations and the colregs when the usv turns to avoid the obstacle it is required to meet γ δγ μ and minimize the change of the usv velocity reducing velocity changes can reduce the risk of inertia and make usv operations safer we adopt the cspso algorithm to optimize δv and δa where δv and δa are set as x 1 x 2 which are two characteristic variables of one particle the requirement is met as follows 10 sin φ δ v x 1 v u cos φ δ v x 2 sin η δ v d v o v o cos η δ v d β μ γ i f γ 0 sin φ δ v x 1 v u cos φ δ v x 2 sin η δ v d v o v o cos η δ v d β μ γ i f γ 0 11 f x 1 x 2 m i n m 1 x 1 m 2 x 2 where m 1 m 2 is a weight that the cspso algorithm optimizes the objective function in 11 by the change of the weight the priority of changing velocity and course will be adjusted the initial angle dimension of the particles should not be restricted which means that δa can be adjusted in the range of π π in some situations if the distance between the usv and the obstacle is dangerous close the collision can only be avoided by changing the trajectory in a shorter time if δa is restricted the objective function may not get a solution cspso algorithm will not get an effective collision avoidance scheme the particle x 1 x 2 corresponds to the optimal δv and δa which can enable the usv to avoid the obstacle safely however the usv may not achieve the ideal δv and δa in one cycle owing to the limitation of its motion capacity for instance suppose that a period of collision avoidance is 5s and the required solution is δv 0 δa π in theory the usv will pass the obstacle by remaining the same velocity and take a sharp turn within 3 5s however it is hard to perform the operation for the motion system of the usv in practice therefore the motion of usv is limited by v u a and w v u is the speed limit of the usv a is the speed change capability and w is the course change capability if δv a or v u δv v u it represents that the expected acceleration is more than the velocity alteration limit or the expected velocity is more than the velocity restriction then 12 δ v u v u v u m i n v u v u a 12a δ a m i n w m a x 0 μ γ δ v δ v o sin η v o δ β cos η δ v u sin φ δ v u cos φ i f γ 0 m a x w m i n 0 μ γ δ v δ v o sin η v o δ β cos η δ v u sin φ δ v u cos φ i f γ 0 if δa w it represents that the expected

sin η v o δ β cos η δ v u cos φ δ v u cos φ i f γ 0 the ultimate goal of our optimization is 12 that the cspso algorithm minimizes the change of the usv velocity and collision avoidance the v u and δ a are the collision avoidance parameters that can measure the dynamic performance of usv because of the limitation of v u a and w the usv can not avoid the moving obstacle in some situations fortunately because it is a non emergency situation for the avoidance action usv will have enough time to change its motion state and avoid the obstacle the steps of collision avoidance calculation are as follows step1 initialize the cspso algorithm step2 judge if the particle satisfies the 11 if it is satisfied calculate the fitness by 12 otherwise the fitness of the particle is abandoned step3 particles update the δv and δa then algorithm preserves the best particle in the swarm step4 check if the terminal condition is satisfied if yes δv and δa are output and performed then go to step5 otherwise go back to step 2 step5 check if δv and δa exceed v u and a respectively if not δv and δa are the avoidance method otherwise follow 12a 13a 2 3 2 overlapping stalemate emergency overlapping stalemate is a special overtaking situation usv surpasses obstacle and obstacle turns towards the usv which can not enable usv to complete situation1 as fig 6 shows it is defined as the overlapping stalemate emergency in fig 6 b the usv stops accelerating and maintains a safe distance from the obstacle if the distance between the moving obstacle and usv is greater than the safety distance then the usv turns to the other direction 3 the usv motion model and effects of currents 3 1 the usv motion model three degrees of freedom model for under actuated usv descried with kinetics equation is given as follows t i fossen 2011 14 m u u f u u v r τ u τ w u t m v v f v u v r τ w v t m r r f r u v r τ r τ w r t where u and v stand for the surge velocity and sway velocity expressed in the body

nonlinear terms including coriolis centripetal and hydrodynamic damping matrices τ w u τ w v and τ w r denote the time varying ocean disturbances caused by wind waves and ocean currents 3 2 effects of currents on path planning for the usv in this section currents with fixed velocity and time varying distribution are discussed for usv navigation fixed currents are mainly applied to navigate in inland rivers and the time varying currents are used to in the ocean to accurately reflect the motion of the currents time varying currents are described by an eastward flowing jet which can be depicted by a mathematical model with north south directional meandering as follows 15 θ x y 1 t a n h y b t c o s k x c t 1 k 2 b t t 2 s i n 2 k x c t 1 2 in 15 b t and k are the properly dimensionless amplitude and wave number of the undulation in the stream function b t can be represented as b t b 0 εcos wt β terms b 0 ε w k and c are adopted to illustrate the time varying currents field that is updated at each integrated value of time alvarez et al 2004 ma et al 2018 fig 7 shows that usv sails and avoids obstacles in fixed currents and time varying currents respectively 4 solution algorithm 4 1 algorithm design particle swarm optimization pso algorithm is based on population collaboration and learning by simulating bird foraging behavior and it has a mutual coordination and information sharing mechanism fernandez martinez et al 2011 in the standard pso algorithm the update formula of new velocity v k 1 and position x k 1 can be expressed as follows 16 v k 1 w v k c 1 r 1 p i x k c 2 r 2 p g x k 17 x k 1 x k 1 v k 1 where v k is the current velocity of the particle x k is the current position of the particle p i is the individual best position p g is the global best position w is weight coefficient c 1 and c 2 are the learning coefficients r 1 and r 2 are random variables between 0 1 in the standard pso algorithm update particle depends on sharing the coordination of the personal and global best particle ignoring the performance of other particles neglecting the performance of other particles will reduce the diversity of particle individuals and possibly fall into the local optimum of complex optimization problems fernandez martinez et al 2011 to overcome these drawbacks the standard pso algorithm is improved by the following three mechanisms 1 the average best position s shared learning factor is introduced to modify the velocity update which can make the particles acquire information from the other particles this method improves the ability of the pso algorithm in global search and group cooperation moreover in fig 8 a the area b is larger than a indicating that the search range of the particles is expanded than the previous mechanism 2 the chaotic map has the properties of ergodicity non repetition and sensitivity ji et al 2006 as shown in fig 8 b the chaotic diminishing strategy can perform a downright search at a higher velocity and prevent the search behavior from premature convergence 3 theoretically according to the pso algorithm optimization principle it is reasonable to conclude that the search behavior should predominate at the first half stage and the convergence process should predominate at the last half stage thus the adaptability of the acceleration coefficients can be defined as 18 c 1 c m a x c m a x c min t i t m 19 c 2 c min c m a x c min t i t m where c 1 and c 2 are acceleration coefficients of linearly decreasing and increasing respectively c max 2 and c min 0 1 t m is the maximum number of iterations t i is the current number of iterations the improved pso algorithm is named chaotic and shared learning factor particle swarm optimization cspso algorithm and update

number between 0 1 c 3 is the new acceleration coefficient w is the chaotic diminishing coefficient s is the shared learning factor m is the number of particles t m and t i are the same as 18 4 2 performance evaluation of the algorithm to verify the effectiveness and practicability of our proposed cspso algorithm classical benchmark functions are used to evaluate its performance there are

by the convergence distribution and diversity of the proximate pareto front three indicators can reflect the performance of the algorithm durillo et al 2009 they are spread indicator si inverted generational distance igd and epsilon indicator ei smaller ei and si values can represent that the algorithm has excellent convergence and the pareto front solutions have better diversity performance smaller igd value indicates that pareto front solutions have better convergence and distribution in non dominated space durillo et al 2009 jiang et al 2017 the three indicators are expressed as follows a spread indicator si si measures the range variance of neighboring solutions in the non dominated set by comparing with the solutions converged to the true pareto front the si is described as follows 24 s i 1 n 1 i 1 n d d i 2 where d i is the minimum distance between two solutions and d is the average value for all d i a smaller si indicates that solutions are uniformly distributed in the non dominated space furthermore if the si 0 all solutions are equidistant on the pareto front b inverted generational distance igd let p denote a set of uniformly distributed solutions in the objective space along the pareto front p is an approximation of the pareto front which is obtained by the algorithm the igd is described as follows 25 i g d p p i 1 p dist p i p p where dist p i p is the euclidean distance between a point x p and its the nearest neighbor in p and p is the cardinal number of p it can be seen from the definition of igd that the smaller igd value the better the quality of p for approximating the whole pareto front moreover if the igd 0 the obtained pareto front contains every point of the true pareto front c epsilon indicator ei ei measures the spread extend of the obtained solutions here the operation algorithm can get a set of solutions that span the entire pareto optimal space the euclidean distance d i can be calculated between consecutive solutions in the obtained non dominated space thereafter from the obtained non dominated solutions the extreme solutions in the objective space are calculated by fitting a curve parallel to the curve of the true pareto optimal front the ei is described as follows 26 e i d f d l i 1 n 1 d i d d f d l n 1 d where d f and d l are the euclidean distances between the extreme solutions and boundary solutions of the obtained non dominated set d is the average of all distances d i n is the number of solutions on the best non dominated space if the ei 0 all solutions are approximately equidistant on the pareto front li et al 2019 the five algorithms were runs fifty times and the necessary solutions for the benchmark functions were preserved the parameters of the algorithms are set as follows cspso m 30 t m 100 c 3 w and s are set by 21 23 tv mopso m 30 t m 100 c 1 c 2 2 nsga ii nsga iia nsga iir and spea2 m 30 t m 100 crossover 0 8 mutation 0 8 as shown in tables 1 and 2 the cspso algorithm has good performance in eleven and nine out of nineteen benchmark functions in ei and si respectively table 3 manifests that the cspso algorithm has better performance in eight out of nineteen benchmark problems in igd therefore it can be concluded that the cspso algorithm has outstanding performance than the other five algorithms in convergence diversity and distribution 4 3 multi objective problem and dynamic crowding distance 4 3 1 multi objective problem the second stage path control is a multi objective problem mop su et al 2019 which can be described as follows 27 min f i x f 1 x i f 2 x i f m x i t 28 x x 1 x n y f x s t x x 1 x n x r m where x is decision space n is the number of decision variables the objective function vector f x includes m m 2 objectives y r m is the objective space f r n r m is the objective mapping function 4 3 2 dynamic crowding distance the traditional crowding distance method may delete several particles in the dense region at once which can damage the distribution of the pareto front lei et al 2014 thus the dynamic crowding distance is proposed to filter non dominated solutions the traditional crowding distance is defined as 29 l i k 1 m f i 1 k f i 1 k where l i is the crowding distance of particles m is the number of the objective function f i k is the kth objective function value of particle the traditional crowding distance strategy is a one time pruning strategy whose procedure is described minutely in lei et al 2014 to overcome the disadvantage of the traditional method this study proposes a dynamic crowding distance strategy to maintain the external archive the procedures are as follows step1 according to 29 the crowding distance of the particles are calculated step2 search the minimum particle called flag in the external archive then delete it step3 recalculate crowding distance of flag 1 and flag 1 by 30 30 l f l a g 1 k 1 m f f l a g 2 k f f l a g 1 k l f l a g 1 k 1 m f f l a g 1 k f f l a g 2 k step4 if the size of the external archive still exceeds the maximum size limit return to step1 otherwise end if the external archive has ten pareto optimal solutions we set the size limit of the external to five pareto fronts as shown below as fig 9 shows it can be observed that the dynamic crowding distance can make the pareto front solutions more evenly distributed than the traditional method biased decision making can select one reasonably efficient path for usv ma et al 2018 values of the five objectives are normalized and transformed as v ij and v ij 0 1 i 1 5 j 1 n path n path is the number of paths suppose that the preference p i of the usv on each objective is equal to a random number in 0 1 the i 1 5 p i 1 and the preference is set to p set p i then usv can get an ideal path with the minimum preference value vp and the vp is described as 31 v p m i n i 1 5 j 1 n p a t h v i j p s e t according to 31 usv can obtain the ideal path by v ij and p set 4 4 solution steps the cspso algorithm solves the two stage path the solution steps are presented as follows in table 4 and table 5 5 computational simulations section 5 1 is a global path planner which can enable usv to carry out global navigation in 4 and 50 task points with the influence of obstacles section 5 2 is a path controller which can make usv get an ideal path with multi objective constraints between two points section 5 3 is an obstacle avoidance method which can allow usv to avoid the random obstacle by the angle between usv and obstacle 5 1 global path testing and algorithm effectiveness in this section an outdoor experiment is shown in 5 1 1 usv accomplishes the cruise task for 4 task points and avoids some obstacles which illustrates that the global planning is feasible in practice then to verify the effectiveness of global planning in theory we set 50 task points for usv in 5 1 2 the simulation experiments show that the cspso algorithm can generate a global path scheme with closed loop and no crossover 5 1 1 global planning effectiveness test to prove the effectiveness and maneuverability of the global path planning model the usv passes 4 task points and returns to the starting point the outdoor experiment is shown in fig 10 in the range of the gps signal usv accomplishes global cruise and collision avoidance which are described in detail as follows firstly fig 10 b shows that 4 task points are set for usv to navigate by water the global path scheme is solved by eq 1 and the cspso algorithm then usv follows the planned path to accomplish global navigation secondly fig 10 a and fig 10 c show that the usv starts from the starting point and returns to the origin at the same time the usv passes through the task point and avoids random obstacles finally to illustrate the effectiveness of the global path in fig 10 d some random floating obstacles are set up to make navigation more difficult for usv then according to the path planning method and collision avoidance rules proposed in this paper not only can usv accomplish global navigation and pass task points but also it can avoid obstacles in the global proposed architecture to sum up fig 10 a b c shows that the usv accomplishes the global sail and returns to the starting point based on the extended tsp model and cspso algorithm fig 10 d illustrates that usv can accomplish the path of z type and a global cruise with the influence of multiple obstacles therefore it is reasonable to conclude that our proposed planning method can accomplish the global task in practice moreover if the usv moves away from the planned route to avoid an obstacle usv will re plan the new shortest path 5 1 2 algorithm effectiveness test to verify the effectiveness of the cspso algorithm for the extended tsp model in theory we choose some improved algorithms to compare with the cspso algorithm the usv passes 50 points in a sea area of 70 km 70 km then usv returns to the initial point to form a closed loop the parameters of algorithms are set as follows cspso m 30 t m 100 c 1 c 2 1 4995 c 3 w and s are set by 20 29 samac hu et al 2010 m 30 t m 200 information 1 evaporation 0 8 constant 1 sga lorenzo et al 2013 zhu et al 2020 m 30 t m 200 crossover 0 8 mutation 0 8 epso alam et al 2015 m 30 t m 200 c 1 c 2 1 4995 isa ji et al 2006 t m 200 initial temperature 500 end temperature 1 cooling speed 0 9 the computing environment of algorithms is in win7 matlab2017b ram4gb core tm i5cpu as shown in fig 11 the global path schemes and convergence curves can be got by five algorithms it is observed that the cspso algorithm converges to the global minimum fitness value quickly in fig 11 f the path of the cspso algorithm is closed loop and no crossing path the fewer intersections mean that the algorithm has strong ergodicity for solving path planning in addition path crossing represents that usv has travel waste and the obtained path scheme may not the global shortest the maximum profit p has a linear relationship with distance see table 5 therefore we can consider that the shortest path is the path of maximum profit fig 11 and table 6 show that the shortest path distance obtained by the cspso algorithm is 446 m and the calculation time of cspso algorithm is 9 6s and the number of iterations is 112 times although sga and epso spend less computing time they do not meet the minimum number of iterations and distance moreover the calculation time is acceptable for the cspso algorithm above all the cspso algorithm has better computing performance than the other four algorithms 5 2 path control between two points with currents and static obstacle 5 2 1 path control with fixed currents in fixed currents we set the usv velocity v 5kn currents velocity v c 0 8kn currents direction θ 0 p set 0 3 0 3 0 1 0 1 0 2 the usv navigates from 5 5 to 90 45 the cspso algorithm could provide 10 non dominated paths as shown in fig 12 a then the information data of the 10 paths are shown in table 7 in fig 12 b four out of ten paths meet the minimum constraint according to 31 we can calculate that the l3 is minimum and its vp 0 37 thus l3 can be used as the final path for usv in order to highlight the effectiveness of the cspso algorithm for solving the multi objective model we use the same parameter settings and filtering rules on five algorithms the five algorithms provided five paths for the usv from 5 5 to 90 45 as shown in fig 13 moreover to better understand the effectiveness of the cspso algorithm we also provide path data of five algorithms in table 8 in fig 13 and table 8 compared with five algorithms the path obtained by the cspso algorithm has the shortest distance the least smoothness and the minimum economic cost although gray 100 and safe 10 are not optimal they are very close to the minimum therefore the cspso algorithm is effective in path planning and collision avoidance 5 2 2 path control with time varying currents in time varying currents we set b 0 1 2 ε 0 3 w 0 4 β π 2 k 0 84 c 0 12 usv velocity v 2kn p set 0 1 0 3 0 2 0 3 0 1 the usv navigates from 2 60 to 98 18 cspso algorithm generates ten paths in fig 14 a and its information data in table 9 in fig 14 a the cspso algorithm provides ten pareto paths for usv four of which satisfy the minimum objective constraint in fig 14 b we found that l3 is the minimum and its vp 0 27 and the usv can choose l3 as the final navigation path fig 15 shows that the five algorithms calculate five paths for the usv from 2 60 to 98 18 respectively among the five algorithms two algorithms cspso isa obtained two paths in the least distance and smoothness and the cspso algorithm takes full advantage of the direction of currents than the other four algorithms therefore compared with other algorithms the path planning of the cspso algorithm not only considers five objectives but also the direction of currents cspso algorithm has better performance than the four other algorithms 5 3 collision avoidance experiment to accurately detect obstacles usv installs a series of auxiliary devices for safe navigation song et al 2018 these devices are 1 scanning radar system 2 automatic centering device 3 vision analysis and tracking system 4 constant temperature device system usv can avoid random moving buoys in fig 16 moreover state recovery and disturbance estimation of usv are based on nonlinear extended state observers eso method jiang et al 2015 from fig 16 we can observe that usv safely avoids random drifting buoys by the collision avoidance method and recognition system in simulation experiments we set up a usv and four moving obstacles in matlab2017b the work is programmed in c script linked to the matlab2017b the presentation platform is visual studio the initial position of the usv is 0 375 its velocity points to the east and the final destination is 810 460 usv can successfully avoid moving obstacles and reach the destination in fig 17 fig 17 shows that usv avoids all the moving obstacles and there is no collision the usv adjusts its course to reach the destination safely the data of avoidance situations are shown in table 10 the movement situations are presented in fig 17 and reflected in table 10 and the usv avoids moving obstacles successfully in four situations in avoidance simulation our proposed method performs 100 simulations for usv and four moving obstacles the success rate of collision avoidance is about 96 four obstacles are set to block or impact the usv intentionally some moving obstacles are likely to exceed the maximum movement ability of usv even with manual manipulators collision is also inevitable 6 conclusions and future studies a novel two stage usv path navigation method has been proposed in this paper relevant conclusions and future research work are as follows 1 the global path scheme is obtained with maximizing the profit per unit time by the tsp model the nonlinear multi objective optimization model is established to get the control path between two points 2 combined with the sharing factor chaotic map and adaptability the cspso algorithm is proposed to solve the tsp model the multi objective equations and collision avoidance calculation the performance of the cspso algorithm is also demonstrated by analyzing the value of three indicators si igd ei in nineteen benchmark functions 3 according to the angle between usv and obstacle a two level dynamic collision avoidance rule is used simulation and outdoor experiments in many scenarios validate that our proposed method is effective in the future we plan to research path planning and task allocation for usv uav auv based on our model and algorithm collision avoidance can be performed by new mechanisms such as visual recognition

global path planning multi objective path control unmanned surface vehicle chaotic and sharing learning particle swarm optimization currents 1 introduction with the features of coordinated cooperation intelligent autonomy and advanced operation usv has been applied and studied widely in navigation patrolling mousazadeh et al 2018 formation control peng et al 2019 liu et al 2016 and intelligent collision avoidance shi et al 2019 song et al 2017 especially in maritime operations han et al 2019 the usv can carry out dangerous tasks beyond the limits of human physiology and usv has some autonomous functions such as accurate strike cyclical operations self destruction and rapid evacuation thereby reducing the need for personnel and logistical support to accomplish tasks more effectively path planning and path control have played an important role and attracted tremendous attention in industrial application and scientific research for usv in recent years natural heuristic algorithms have achieved a lot of generous achievements in path research the solving algorithms are roughly classified as classical accurate algorithms and biological heuristic algorithms with its rigid procedures accurate algorithms can achieve an optimal solution if the one exists whereas heuristic algorithms can obtain the solution when accurate algorithms lose effectiveness particle swarm optimization pso genetic algorithm ga ant colony algorithm ac and artificial fish swarm algorithm afsa belong to the biological heuristic algorithms the pso algorithm has the merits of simple operation easy implementation and population based evolutionary ability fernandez martinez et al 2011 meanwhile the pso algorithm has been developed for nearly twenty years and has made considerable progress in solving complex optimization problems ramet al 2016 mistry et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 especially pso based path problems have been developed rapidly for example an improved pso was proposed to solve the multi objective the shortest and safest path for the robot gong et al 2013 an improved pso was applied to multi objective path planning with the shortest distance and the smoothest path in the literature mac et al 2017 wu 2019 combined pso algorithm to study coordinated path planning and target strike for unmanned aerial aquatic vehicle and autonomous underwater vehicle shao et al 2019 proposed path planning for an unmanned aerial vehicle with multi objective linear summation based on an improved pso das et al 2016 presented an improved pso and gravitational search algorithm

performance guarantees for usvs dong et al 2020 proposed neural network based adaptive output feedback formation tracking control of usvs under collision avoidance and connectivity maintenance constraints he et al 2019 researched leader follower formation control of usvs with prescribed performance and collision avoidance moreover there are many other well performing algorithms for path planning with the marine environment such as q learning for smart ships path planning chen et al 2019 a approach towards optimal path planning for an unmanned surface vehicle singh et al 2018 multi layered fast marching method for unmanned surface vehicle path planning in a time variant maritime environment song et al 2017 dijkstra search and energy consumption function are combined to solve path planning niu et al 2018 the ga algorithm solved path planning for autonomous underwater vehicles in a variable ocean alvarez et al 2004 to sum up it could be observed that several previous studies focused on optimizing one or two goals simultaneously and rarely took note of the global path planning and path control with joint optimization of five goals however the paper not only proposes a novel path planning method and path control with multi objective constraints but also provides two level collision avoidance rules the impact of currents and effectively improve the pso algorithm thus the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows i we maximize the profit per unit time for the travelling salesman problem to establish a global path planning model the goal of which is to get the global shortest path for usv with multiple task points ii between two task locations the path control models are established with five objective constraints including path distance smoothness stranding risk economic cost and safety in addition the effects of currents are also considered in our study iii according to the characteristics of the models the cspso algorithm is introduced to solve the global path planning and multi objective path control furthermore if the obstacle navigates without following the colregs convention the two level dynamic avoidance rules are applied to avoid an obstacle a novel path planning method is proposed to address the challenges of a two stage path plan and collision avoidance moreover numerical simulations and experiments verify that the proposed planning method and cspso algorithm are effective 2 problem formulation in this paper the usv navigation method is divided into two stages the first stage is the global path planning usv passes through all task points once and returns to the starting point which is described in fig 1 a in general the shorter path distance means lower cost which can increase profit in unit time the second stage is the path control usv avoids obstacle with the multi objective constraints and makes full use of currents direction between two task points as shown in fig 1 b 2 1 usv global path planning in this section a new version of the travelling salesman problem model is introduced for usv global path planning liu et al 2018 in which the goal is to maximize the profit per unit time when the travel time is resource dependent usv is assumed to be a salesman who is required to visit n cities the variable parameters are defined as follows g v e is a complete graph where v is the set of vertex representing the n cities each pair of vertex i and j is connected by edge i j t i j and s i j mean the time and cost for travel from i to j t and c mean the total travel time and the total travel cost r means the total travel revenue p means the profit per unit time x i j is a binary decision variable that can be defined as value 1 if the salesman travels from i to j otherwise x i j 0 the total travel cost is c the net profit is r c here the maximum net profit equals the minimum total cost which corresponds to the classical tsp model suppose that the net profit is non negative the total travel time is t i 1 n j n t i j x i j the total travel cost is c i 1 n j n s i j x i j therefore the profit per unit time is p r c t r i 1 n j n s i j x i j i 1 n j n t i j x i j the purpose of the travel is to maximize p which subjects to the following classical tsp constraints 1 each vertex must be visited exactly once 2 no sub tours are allowed combined above research global path planning based on the tsp model is established as follows 1 m a x p r i 1 n j n s i j x i j i 1 n j n t i j x i j 1a s t j 1 n x i j 1 i 1 n 1b i 1 n x i j 1 j 1 n 1c x i j 0 1 i 1 n j 1 n constraints 1a and 1b ensure that all vertexes are visited exactly once equation 1 enables the usv to obtain the maximum profit or the shortest global path scheme 2 2 multi objective path control for usv the path control of usv integrates five objective constraints including path distance smoothness stranding risk economic cost and safety risk 2 2 1 the shortest path distance generally the shortest path distance can save work time and energy which can enable usv to accomplish the task quickly the distance objective function j 1 is defined as 2 j 1 l m i n i 1 m x i 1 x i 2 y i 1 y i 2 where path l is composed by several sequential line segments x i i 1 m from starting point x i 1 y to destination x i y i in cartesian coordinates 2 2 2 the smoothest path a smooth path can reduce turning vibration and strengthen maneuverability which can enable usv to move smoothly and stably the smoothness path objective function j 2 can be defined as 3 j 2 m i n i 1 m θ i 1 m a t a n 2 y i 1 y i x i 1 x i a t a n 2 y i y i 1 x i x i 1 where θ is steering angle x i 1 y i 1 x i y i and x i 1 y i 1 are the three vertexes of the steering angle atan2 is four quadrant arc tangent 2 2 3 the minimum stranding risk path during the usv navigation the computation center can obtain underwater depth contour images with radar and visual systems in fig 2 a fig 2 b is grayed out to fig 2 c as follows the grayscale objective function j 3 is defined as 4 j 3 m a x i 1 m a g r a y s c a l e i in the figure different colors and brightness can show different gray levels the grayscale range is from 0 to 255 the smaller the grayscale for the figure the more likely it is to be stranded for usv 2 2 4 the safest path the usv can pass through the navigable territory without any collision the safety objective function j 4 is defined as 5 j 4 m i n j 1 m d s a f e 1 d r j d s a f e min j 0 d r j d s a f e max j d r j d s a f e min j d s a f e max j d s a f e min j o t h e r where d r j d safe minj and d safe maxj represent the real distance least distance and the lower limit of the maximum distance between the usv and obstacle respectively the smaller d safe value the safer the path usv can safely avoid obstacles 2 2 5 the minimal economic cost path the minimal economic cost means minimal energy consumption which enables usv to accomplish more ocean tasks the cost objective function j 5 is defined as 6 j 5 min e i 1 m t w where e is energy consumption the cost e is defined as the travel time t multiplied by the engine power w of the unit time to save energy not only does the usv get a shorter path but also moves along the direction of currents 2 3 usv collision avoidance in two situations in this section collision avoidance method from song et al 2018 is used to this paper fig 3 shows the motion state of usv and moving obstacle where v r and v o represent the velocity of usv and moving obstacle respectively d and d are the identification zone of usv and obstacle u and o represent usv and obstacle respectively the state of the usv can be defined as follows 1 d d ø is a safe state that the obstacle does not enter the identification zone of the usv 2 d d ø is a dangerous situation that the usv and obstacle have overlapped 2 3 1 general emergency according to the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs cheng et al 2018 three kinds of steering situations are discussed in fig 4 a song et al 2018 in fig 4 the usv generates a collision avoidance trajectory and angle division in three situations the δ θ is a navigation angle between the usv and the moving obstacle the three collision avoidance rules are shown below situation1 overtaking usv and obstacle sail in the same direction if the δ θ satisfies 30 90 in the horizontal direction the situation is dangerous and defined as an overtaking moving obstacle maintains the original route then the usv can accelerate and pass the obstacle from its port side cheng et al 2018 situation2 head on usv and obstacle sail towards each other if the δ θ satisfies 0 30 the situation is more dangerous than overtaking and it is defined as head on the moving obstacle turns to the right and passes through the left side of the usv usv will move to the right and pass from the left side of the obstacle or they will collide in addition usv always keeps a safe distance from the obstacle situation3 crossing the movement of usv and obstacle are shown in fig 4 if the δ θ satisfies 90 120 the situation is also dangerous and it is defined as a crossing moving obstacle maintains the original route then usv moves to the back of the obstacle or usv stops accelerating and keeps waiting according to colregs there are three ways to avoid a collision however the obstacle does not follow the colregs and moves to the usv usv can carry out collision avoidance operation by the following method we can judge the collision probability by changing the angle and speed of the usv the speed and angle parameters of usv and obstacle are shown in fig 5 song et al 2018 in fig 5 u and o represent the usv and the obstacle respectively v u a is the speed and angle of the usv v o β is the speed and angle of the obstacle δv and δa represent speed change and angle change of usv which should be adjusted for collision avoidance γ is the yaw angle to ensure usv to avoid collision μ is an angle that usv turns to the maximum safety distance point of o ut 1 and ut 2 represent two tangents from u to the domain of the o other parameters a x v u β x v o θ x uo γ uo δv ϕ δv v u μ uo ut in fig 5 if γ μ it is impossible for the usv to collide with an obstacle variables v u v o and δv constitute the velocity vector triangle fiorini and shiller 1998 7 v o sin α β δ v sin φ v u v o cos α β δ v cos φ v u 2 v o 2 2 v u v o cos α β δ v 2 v u sin β α δ v sin η v o v u cos β α δ v cos η 8 γ tan 1 v u sin a θ v o sin β θ v u cos a θ v o cos β θ if the velocity vector δv is between the two lines ut1 and ut2 the usv needs to avoid the obstacle tam et al 2013 this is defined as a non emergency situation and can be written as γ μ then we take the derivative of 8 9 d γ sin φ δ v d v u v u cos φ δ v d a sin η δ v d v o v o cos η δ v d β where the obstacle speed v o angle β δγ is the change of γ and δγ can be altered by adjusting the speed v u and the angle a of usv δv and δa represent speed and angle change of usv according to security regulations and the colregs when the usv turns to avoid the obstacle it is required to meet γ δγ μ and minimize the change of the usv velocity reducing velocity changes can reduce the risk of inertia and make usv operations safer we adopt the cspso algorithm to optimize δv and δa where δv and δa are set as x 1 x 2 which are two characteristic variables of one particle the requirement is met as follows 10 sin φ δ v x 1 v u cos φ δ v x 2 sin η δ v d v o v o cos η δ v d β μ γ i f γ 0 sin φ δ v x 1 v u cos φ δ v x 2 sin η δ v d v o v o cos η δ v d β μ γ i f γ 0 11 f x 1 x 2 m i n m 1 x 1 m 2 x 2 where m 1 m 2 is a weight that the cspso algorithm optimizes the objective function in 11 by the change of the weight the priority of changing velocity and course will be adjusted the initial angle dimension of the particles should not be restricted which means that δa can be adjusted in the range of π π in some situations if the distance between the usv and the obstacle is dangerous close the collision can only be avoided by changing the trajectory in a shorter time if δa is restricted the objective function may not get a solution cspso algorithm will not get an effective collision avoidance scheme the particle x 1 x 2 corresponds to the optimal δv and δa which can enable the usv to avoid the obstacle safely however the usv may not achieve the ideal δv and δa in one cycle owing to the limitation of its motion capacity for instance suppose that a period of collision avoidance is 5s and the required solution is δv 0 δa π in theory the usv will pass the obstacle by remaining the same velocity and take a sharp turn within 3 5s however it is hard to perform the operation for the motion system of the usv in practice therefore the motion of usv is limited by v u a and w v u is the speed limit of the usv a is the speed change capability and w is the course change capability if δv a or v u δv v u it represents that the expected acceleration is more than the velocity alteration limit or the expected velocity is more than the velocity restriction then 12 δ v u v u v u m i n v u v u a 12a δ a m i n

a are the collision avoidance parameters that can measure the dynamic performance of usv because of the limitation of v u a and w the usv can not avoid the moving obstacle in some situations fortunately because it is a non emergency situation for the avoidance action usv will have enough time to change its motion state and avoid the obstacle the steps of collision avoidance calculation are as follows step1 initialize the cspso algorithm step2 judge if the particle satisfies the 11 if it is satisfied calculate the fitness by 12 otherwise the fitness of the particle is abandoned step3 particles update the δv and δa then algorithm preserves the best particle in the swarm step4 check if the terminal condition is satisfied if yes δv and δa are output and performed then go to step5 otherwise go back to step 2 step5 check if δv and δa exceed v u and a respectively if not δv and δa are the avoidance method otherwise follow 12a 13a 2 3 2 overlapping stalemate emergency overlapping stalemate is a special overtaking situation usv surpasses obstacle and obstacle turns towards the usv which can not enable usv to complete situation1 as fig 6 shows it is defined as the overlapping stalemate emergency in fig 6 b the usv stops accelerating and maintains a safe distance from the obstacle if the distance between the moving obstacle and usv is greater than the safety distance then the usv turns to the other direction 3 the usv motion model and effects of currents 3 1 the usv motion model three degrees of freedom model for under actuated usv descried with kinetics equation is given as follows t i fossen 2011 14 m u u f u u v r τ u τ w u t m v v f v u v r τ w v t m r r f r u v r τ r τ w r t where u and v stand for the surge velocity and sway velocity expressed in the body

nonlinear terms including coriolis centripetal and hydrodynamic damping matrices τ w u τ w v and τ w r denote the time varying ocean disturbances caused by wind waves and ocean currents 3 2 effects of currents on path planning for the usv in this section currents with fixed velocity and time varying distribution are discussed for usv navigation fixed currents are mainly applied to navigate in inland rivers and the time varying currents are used to in the ocean to accurately reflect the motion of the currents time varying currents are described by an eastward flowing jet which can be depicted by a mathematical model with north south directional meandering as follows 15 θ x y 1 t a n h y b t c o s k x c t 1 k 2 b t t 2 s i n 2 k x c t 1 2 in 15 b t and k are the properly dimensionless amplitude and wave number of the undulation in the stream function b t can be represented as b t b 0 εcos wt β terms b 0 ε w k and c are adopted to illustrate the time varying currents field that is updated at each integrated value of time alvarez et al 2004 ma et al 2018 fig 7 shows that usv sails and avoids obstacles in fixed currents and time varying currents respectively 4 solution algorithm 4 1 algorithm design particle swarm optimization pso algorithm is based on population collaboration and learning by simulating bird foraging behavior and it has a mutual coordination and information sharing mechanism fernandez martinez et al 2011 in the standard pso algorithm the update formula of new velocity v k 1 and position x k 1 can be expressed as follows 16 v k 1 w v k c 1 r 1 p i x k c 2 r 2 p g x k 17 x k 1 x k 1 v k 1 where v k is the current velocity of the particle x k is the current position of the particle p i is the individual best position p g is the global best position w is weight coefficient c 1 and c 2 are the learning coefficients r 1 and r 2 are random variables between 0 1 in the standard pso algorithm update particle depends on sharing the coordination of the personal and global best particle ignoring the performance of other particles neglecting the performance of other particles will reduce the diversity of particle individuals and possibly fall into the local optimum of complex optimization problems fernandez martinez et al 2011 to overcome these drawbacks the standard pso algorithm is improved by the following three mechanisms 1 the average best position s shared learning factor is introduced to modify the velocity update which can make the particles acquire information from the other particles this method improves the ability of the pso algorithm in global search and group cooperation moreover in fig 8 a the area b is larger than a indicating that the search range of the particles is expanded than the previous mechanism 2 the chaotic map has the properties of ergodicity non repetition and sensitivity ji et al 2006 as shown in fig 8 b the chaotic diminishing strategy can perform a downright search at a higher velocity and prevent the search behavior from premature convergence 3 theoretically according to the pso algorithm optimization principle it is reasonable to conclude that the search behavior should predominate at the first half stage and the convergence process should predominate at the last half stage thus the adaptability of the acceleration coefficients can be defined as 18 c 1 c m a x c m a x c min t i t m 19 c 2 c min c m a x c min t i t m where c 1 and c 2 are acceleration coefficients of linearly decreasing and increasing respectively c max 2 and c min 0 1 t m is the maximum number of iterations t i is the current number of iterations the improved pso algorithm is named chaotic and shared learning factor particle swarm optimization cspso algorithm and update formulas are described as follows 20 v k w v k c 1 r 1 p i x k c 2 r 2 p g x k c 3 r 3 s x k 21 c 3 1 t i t m 22 w a s i n π i i t e r 1 t m t i t m 0 a 1 23 s t 1 m i 1 m p i t where r 3 is a random number between 0 1 c 3 is the new acceleration coefficient w is the chaotic diminishing coefficient s is the shared learning factor m is the number of particles t m and t i are the same as 18 4 2 performance evaluation of the algorithm to verify the effectiveness and practicability of our proposed cspso algorithm classical benchmark functions are used to evaluate its performance there are nineteen benchmark functions for multi objective problems durillo et al 2009 including five zdt functions zdt1 zdt2 zdt3 zdt4 and zdt6 seven dtlz functions with two objectives dtlz1 2d dtlz2 2d dtlz3 2d dtlz4 2d dtlz5 2d dtlz6 2d and dt lz7 2d and seven dtlz functions with three objectives dtlz1 3d dtlz2 3d dtlz3 3d dtlz4 3d dtlz5 3d dtlz6 3d dtlz7 3d the letters z d t and l are initials of four researchers names who formulated and explained these benchmark functions in zitzler et al 2000 the comparison algorithms are given as follows 1 improved strength pareto evolutionary algorithm spea2 2 non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii 3 adaptive variation operator selection genetic algorithm nsga iia 4 random variation operator selection genetic algorithm nsga iir 5 total weight variant multi objective particle swarm optimization tv mopso the above five algorithms are explained by durillo et al 2009 and jiang et al 2017 moreover the performance of algorithms can be evaluated by the convergence distribution and diversity of the proximate pareto front three indicators can reflect the performance of the algorithm durillo et al 2009 they are spread indicator si inverted generational distance igd and epsilon indicator ei smaller ei and si values can represent that the algorithm has excellent convergence and the pareto front solutions have better diversity performance smaller igd value indicates that pareto front solutions have better convergence and distribution in non dominated space durillo et al 2009 jiang et al 2017 the three indicators are expressed as follows a spread indicator si si measures the range variance of neighboring solutions in the non dominated set by comparing with the solutions converged to the true pareto front the si is described as follows 24 s i 1 n 1 i 1 n d d i 2 where d i is the minimum distance between two solutions and d is the average value for all d i a smaller si indicates that solutions are uniformly distributed in the non dominated space furthermore if the si 0 all solutions are equidistant on the pareto front b inverted generational distance igd let p denote a set of uniformly distributed solutions in the objective space along the pareto front p is an approximation of the pareto front which is obtained by the algorithm the igd is described as follows 25 i g d p p i 1 p dist p i p p where dist p i p is the euclidean distance between a point x p and its the nearest neighbor in p and p is the cardinal number of p it can be seen from the definition of igd that the smaller igd value the better the quality of p for approximating the whole pareto front moreover if the igd 0 the obtained pareto front contains every point of the true pareto front c epsilon indicator ei ei measures the spread extend of the obtained solutions here the operation algorithm can get a set of solutions that span the entire pareto optimal space the euclidean distance d i can be calculated between consecutive solutions in the obtained non dominated space thereafter from the obtained non dominated solutions the extreme solutions in the objective space are calculated by fitting a curve parallel to the curve of the true pareto optimal front the ei is described as follows 26 e i d f d l i 1 n 1 d i d d f d l n 1 d where d f and d l are the euclidean distances between the extreme solutions and boundary solutions of the obtained non dominated set d is the average of all distances d i n is the number of solutions on the best non dominated space if the ei 0 all solutions are approximately equidistant on the pareto front li et al 2019 the five algorithms were runs fifty times and the necessary solutions for the benchmark functions were preserved the parameters of the algorithms are set as follows cspso m 30 t m 100 c 3 w and s are set by 21 23 tv mopso m 30 t m 100 c 1 c 2 2 nsga ii nsga iia nsga iir and spea2 m 30 t m 100 crossover 0 8 mutation 0 8 as shown in tables 1 and 2 the cspso algorithm has good performance in eleven and nine out of nineteen benchmark functions in ei and si respectively table 3 manifests that the cspso algorithm has better performance in eight out of nineteen benchmark problems in igd therefore it can be concluded that the cspso algorithm has outstanding performance than the other five algorithms in convergence diversity and distribution 4 3 multi objective problem and dynamic crowding distance 4 3 1 multi objective problem the second stage path control is a multi objective problem mop su et al 2019 which can be described as follows 27 min f i x f 1 x i f 2 x i f m x i t 28 x x 1 x n y f x s t x x 1 x n x r m where x is decision space n is the number of decision variables the objective function vector f x includes m m 2 objectives y r m is the objective space f r n r m is the objective mapping function 4 3 2 dynamic crowding distance the traditional crowding distance method may delete several particles in the dense region at once which can damage the distribution of the pareto front lei et al 2014 thus the dynamic crowding distance is proposed to filter non dominated solutions the traditional crowding distance is defined as 29 l i k 1 m f i 1 k f i 1 k where l i is the crowding distance of particles m is the number of the objective function f i k is the kth objective function value of particle the traditional crowding distance strategy is a one time pruning strategy whose procedure is described minutely in lei et al 2014 to overcome the disadvantage of the traditional method this study proposes a dynamic crowding distance strategy to maintain the external archive the procedures are as follows step1 according to 29 the crowding distance of the particles are calculated step2 search the minimum particle called flag in the external archive then delete it step3 recalculate crowding distance of flag 1 and flag 1 by 30 30 l f l a g 1 k 1 m f f l a g 2 k f f l a g 1 k l f l a g 1 k 1 m f f l a g 1 k f f l a g 2 k step4 if the size of the external archive still exceeds the maximum size limit return to step1 otherwise end if the external archive has ten pareto optimal solutions we set the size limit of the external to five pareto fronts as shown below as fig 9 shows it can be observed that the dynamic crowding distance can make the pareto front solutions more evenly distributed than the traditional method biased decision making can select one reasonably efficient path for usv ma et al 2018 values of the five objectives are normalized and transformed as v ij and v ij 0 1 i 1 5 j 1 n path n path is the number of paths suppose that the preference p i of the usv on each objective is equal to a random number in 0 1 the i 1 5 p i 1 and the preference is set to p set p i then usv can get an ideal path with the minimum preference value vp and the vp is described as 31 v p m i n i 1 5 j 1 n p a t h v i j p s e t according to 31 usv can obtain the ideal path by v ij and p set 4 4 solution steps the cspso algorithm solves the two stage path the solution steps are presented as follows in table 4 and table 5 5 computational simulations section 5 1 is a global path planner which can enable usv to carry out global navigation in 4 and 50 task points with the influence of obstacles section 5 2 is a path controller which can make usv get an ideal path with multi objective constraints between two points section 5 3 is an obstacle avoidance method which can allow usv to avoid the random obstacle by the angle between usv and obstacle 5 1 global path testing and algorithm effectiveness in this section an outdoor experiment is shown in 5 1 1 usv accomplishes the cruise task for 4 task points and avoids some obstacles which illustrates that the global planning is feasible in practice then to verify the effectiveness of global planning in theory we set 50 task points for usv in 5 1 2 the simulation experiments show that the cspso algorithm can generate a global path scheme with closed loop and no crossover 5 1 1 global planning effectiveness test to prove the effectiveness and maneuverability of the global path planning model the usv passes 4 task points and returns to the starting point the outdoor experiment is shown in fig 10 in the range of the gps signal usv accomplishes global cruise and collision avoidance which are described in detail as follows firstly fig 10 b shows that 4 task points are set for usv to navigate by water the global path scheme is solved by eq 1 and the cspso algorithm then usv follows the planned path to accomplish global navigation secondly fig 10 a and fig 10 c show that the usv starts from the starting point and returns to the origin at the same time the usv passes through the task point and avoids random obstacles finally to illustrate the effectiveness of the global path in fig 10 d some random floating obstacles are set up to make navigation more difficult for usv then according to the path planning method and collision avoidance rules proposed in this paper not only can usv accomplish global navigation and pass task points but also it can avoid obstacles in the global proposed architecture to sum up fig 10 a b c shows that the usv accomplishes the global sail and returns to the starting point based on the extended tsp model and cspso algorithm fig 10 d illustrates that usv can accomplish the path of z type and a global cruise with the influence of multiple obstacles therefore it is reasonable to conclude that our proposed planning method can accomplish the global task in practice moreover if the usv moves away from the planned route to avoid an obstacle usv will re plan the new shortest path 5 1 2 algorithm effectiveness test to verify the effectiveness of the cspso algorithm for the extended tsp model in theory we choose some improved algorithms to compare with the cspso algorithm the usv passes 50 points in a sea area of 70 km 70 km then usv returns to the initial point to form a closed loop the parameters of algorithms are set as follows cspso m 30 t m 100 c 1 c 2 1 4995 c 3 w and s are set by 20 29 samac hu et al 2010 m 30 t m 200 information 1 evaporation 0 8 constant 1 sga lorenzo et al 2013 zhu et al 2020 m 30 t m 200 crossover 0 8 mutation 0 8 epso alam et al 2015 m 30 t m 200 c 1 c 2 1 4995 isa ji et al 2006 t m 200 initial temperature 500 end temperature 1 cooling speed 0 9 the computing environment of algorithms is in win7 matlab2017b ram4gb core tm i5cpu as shown in fig 11 the global path schemes and convergence curves can be got by five algorithms it is observed that the cspso algorithm converges to the global minimum fitness value quickly in fig 11 f the path of the cspso algorithm is closed loop and no crossing path the fewer intersections mean that the algorithm has strong ergodicity for solving path planning in addition path crossing represents that usv has travel waste and the obtained path scheme may not the global shortest the maximum profit p has a linear relationship with distance see table 5 therefore we can consider that the shortest path is the path of maximum profit fig 11 and table 6 show that the shortest path distance obtained by the cspso algorithm is 446 m and the calculation time of cspso algorithm is 9 6s and the number of iterations is 112 times although sga and epso spend less computing time they do not meet the minimum number of iterations and distance moreover the calculation time is acceptable for the cspso algorithm above all the cspso algorithm has better computing performance than the other four algorithms 5 2 path control between two points with currents and static obstacle 5 2 1 path control with fixed currents in fixed currents we set the usv velocity v 5kn currents velocity v c 0 8kn currents direction θ 0 p set 0 3 0 3 0 1 0 1 0 2 the usv navigates from 5 5 to 90 45 the cspso algorithm could provide 10 non dominated paths as shown in fig 12 a then the information data of the 10 paths are shown in table 7 in fig 12 b four out of ten paths meet the minimum constraint according to 31 we can calculate that the l3 is minimum and its vp 0 37 thus l3 can be used as the final path for usv in order to highlight the effectiveness of the cspso algorithm for solving the multi objective model we use the same parameter settings and filtering rules on five algorithms the five algorithms provided five paths for the usv from 5 5 to 90 45 as shown in fig 13 moreover to better understand the effectiveness of the cspso algorithm we also provide path data of five algorithms in table 8 in fig 13 and table 8 compared with five algorithms the path obtained by the cspso algorithm has the shortest distance the least smoothness and the minimum economic cost although gray 100 and safe 10 are not optimal they are very close to the minimum therefore the cspso algorithm is effective in path planning and collision avoidance 5 2 2 path control with time varying currents in time varying currents we set b 0 1 2 ε 0 3 w 0 4 β π 2 k 0 84 c 0 12 usv velocity v 2kn p set 0 1 0 3 0 2 0 3 0 1 the usv navigates from 2 60 to 98 18 cspso algorithm generates ten paths in fig 14 a and its information data in table 9 in fig 14 a the cspso algorithm provides ten pareto paths for usv four of which satisfy the minimum objective constraint in fig 14 b we found that l3 is the minimum and its vp 0 27 and the usv can choose l3 as the final navigation path fig 15 shows that the five algorithms calculate five paths for the usv from 2 60 to 98 18 respectively among the five algorithms two algorithms cspso isa obtained two paths in the least distance and smoothness and the cspso algorithm takes full advantage of the direction of currents than the other four algorithms therefore compared with other algorithms the path planning of the cspso algorithm not only considers five objectives but also the direction of currents cspso algorithm has better performance than the four other algorithms 5 3 collision avoidance experiment to accurately detect obstacles usv installs a series of auxiliary devices for safe navigation song et al 2018 these devices are 1 scanning radar system 2 automatic centering device 3 vision analysis and tracking system 4 constant temperature device system usv can avoid random moving buoys in fig 16 moreover state recovery and disturbance estimation of usv are based on nonlinear extended state observers eso method jiang et al 2015 from fig 16 we can observe that usv safely avoids random drifting buoys by the collision avoidance method and recognition system in simulation experiments we set up a usv and four moving obstacles in matlab2017b the work is programmed in c script linked to the matlab2017b the presentation platform is visual studio the initial position of the usv is 0 375 its velocity points to the east and the final destination is 810 460 usv can successfully avoid moving obstacles and reach the destination in fig 17 fig 17 shows that usv avoids all the moving obstacles and there is no collision the usv adjusts its course to reach the destination safely the data of avoidance situations are shown in table 10 the movement situations are presented in fig 17 and reflected in table 10 and the usv avoids moving obstacles successfully in four situations in avoidance simulation our proposed method performs 100 simulations for usv and four moving obstacles the success rate of collision avoidance is about 96 four obstacles are set to block or impact the usv intentionally some moving obstacles are likely to exceed the maximum movement ability of usv even with manual manipulators collision is also inevitable 6 conclusions and future studies a novel two stage usv path navigation method has been proposed in this paper relevant conclusions and future research work are as follows 1 the global path scheme is obtained with maximizing the profit per unit time by the tsp model the nonlinear multi objective optimization model is established to get the control path between two points 2 combined with the sharing factor chaotic map and adaptability the cspso algorithm is proposed to solve the tsp model the multi objective equations and collision avoidance calculation the performance of the cspso algorithm is also demonstrated by analyzing the value of three indicators si igd ei in nineteen benchmark functions 3 according to the angle between usv and obstacle a two level dynamic collision avoidance rule is used simulation and outdoor experiments in many scenarios validate that our proposed method is effective in the future we plan to research path planning and task allocation for usv uav auv based on our model and algorithm collision avoidance can be performed by new mechanisms such as visual recognition

21483,in situ soil properties exhibit natural spatial variability in this study the karhunen loève k l expansion method and the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method are integrated to simulate large deformation behavior of slopes with spatially varied shear strengths the impact on pipelines induced by spatially varied landslides is investigated the mean value of the maximum impact force is significantly larger than the deterministic value obtained for a homogeneous slope the proportion of the maximum impact force from stochastic analysis that exceeds the deterministic value is much greater than 50 this result shows that the deterministic study can significantly underestimate the damage of pipeline by a landslide if the spatial variability is not considered the uncertainty of the impact force increases with the coefficient of variation cov of the undrained shear strength and decreases with the reduction of horizontal correlation length by considering buckling failure and plastic yielding failure of pipelines the failure probabilities are assessed and a pipeline design based on stochastic analysis for spatially varied slope is presented keywords random field coupled eulerian lagrangian method large deformation landslide impact force failure of pipeline 1 introduction submarine landslide is a large deformation and dynamic process that can cause serious damage to offshore installations such as pipelines studies of the large deformation process of submarine landslides and the interaction between landslides and offshore pipelines are extremely essential to the safety design in practical engineering previous studies mainly used the fluid mechanics approach and the geotechnical approach to simulate the soil pipeline interaction the fluid mechanics method regards the soil mass as an incompressible viscous fluid zakeri 2009 zakeri et al 2009 fan et al 2018 liu et al 2015 rheological models such as bingham herschel bulkley and other non newtonian fluids laws are used to describe the rate dependent shear strength of the soil fan et al 2018 guo et al 2019 the drag force on the pipeline caused by the soil fluid is computed in terms of a drag coefficient associated with the non newtonian reynolds number dong et al 2017 the drag force obtained by the fluid mechanics approach usually works well at a moderate or high velocity of the slide because the inertial effect is dominant at high velocity however the geotechnical resistance related to the shear strength mainly affects the drag force on pipelines and the inertial effect is negligible when the sliding velocity is low randolph and white 2012 dong et al 2017 therefore under the situation of low sliding velocity the geotechnical approach that directly links the drag force with the shear strength is more appropriate to simulate the interaction between landslides and pipelines randolph and white 2012 liu et al 2015 note that the previous studies on the interaction between landslides and pipelines mentioned above are all deterministic analyses the sliding mass is usually considered with a constant volume an assumed slip surface and an initial sliding velocity the uncertainty of landslide due to natural variability of soil properties is not considered the complex process of soil deposition may introduce different distributions of soil fabric over space which can cause the spatial variability of soil properties degroot and baecher 1993 dasaka and zhang 2012 allahverdizadeh et al 2016 ching et al 2016 lacasse et al 2017 ering and sivakumar babu 2017 papaioannou and straub 2017 yong et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 fig 1 shows the fundamental geotechnical properties of the soft marine clay in pusan of korea tanaka et al 2001 soil compositions soil density liquid limit wl plastic limit wp natural water content wn and strengths from cpt and field vane tests are presented the soil properties fluctuate with violent or mild deviations along the depth which indicates the existence of the natural spatial variability of soil spatially varied shear strength in soil may affect the failure mode of a landslide li et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 different failure modes may cause different slip surfaces volumes of sliding mass and sliding velocities which finally affect the impact force on the pipeline therefore the spatial variability of soil properties should be considered properly in the soil pipeline interaction analysis a probabilistic method is of more advantages than the deterministic method to address this kind of problem and the statistic results can be used in the risk assessment about the damage caused by soil pipeline interaction probabilistic methods considering spatial variability have been conducted in slope stability analysis the random limit equilibrium method rlem and random finite element method rfem are typical methods which combine the random theory with the widely used slope stability analysis methods for example the rlem was used to evaluate the probabilistic distribution of factors of safety and potential slip surfaces in a slope cho 2007 zhu et al 2018 the rfem is not only able to evaluate the probabilistic distribution of factors of safety but also able to describe the evolutions of stresses and strains in spatially varied slopes griffiths and fenton 2004 li et al 2015 javankhoshdel et al 2017 luo and bathurst 2018 however these methods cannot address the post failure stage characterized by large deformation therefore a large deformation method incorporated with the random theory is needed to quantify the probabilistic distributions of the runout behavior of a submarine landslide and the subsequent impact force on pipeline at present many large deformation numerical methods such as discrete element method dem smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph and material point method mpm have been applied in the simulation of landslides mcdougall 2016 chen et al 2018 mohammadi and taiebat 2013 lu et al 2014 guo and zhao 2014 pastor et al 2009 wang et al 2018a dong et al 2017 however homogeneous slopes are often considered in these previous studies the investigations about large deformation analysis coupled with spatial variability are emerged recently wang et al 2019 proposed a random smoothed particle hydrodynamics rsph combining random field with smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph with which method the failure probability influence zone and volume of sliding mass during slope post failure were estimated zhang et al 2020 investigated the variability effect of internal friction angle on the slope post failure based on rsph wang et al 2016 2017 adopted the rmpm random material point method that combines mpm with the random field to study the large deformation failure of the slope considering spatial variability the heterogeneity was shown to have a significant effect on the evolution of the slope failure mechanism e g the retrogression failure and random modeling based on the traditional small strain fem analyses would yield un conservative results liu et al 2019 combined the random field with both lem and mpm to form a rle mpm framework to improve the computational efficiency of rmpm in this study the dynamic impact behavior on a pipeline induced by a submarine landslide considering natural spatial variability of soil properties is investigated in a probabilistic framework the karhunen loève k l expansion method and the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method are integrated to simulate large deformation behaviors of spatially varied slopes the proposed method is named as random coupled eulerian lagrangian rcel method a numerical example is presented to investigate the effect of spatial variability on failure modes of landslides and the impact force on pipelines the results of the stochastic analyses are compared with the deterministic result to demonstrate the importance of spatial variability 2 the random coupled eulerian lagrangian rcel method 2 1 generation of realizations for spatial varied soil properties with k l expansion the k l expansion method li and der kiureghian 1993 sudret and der kiureghian 2000 yang et al 2019 is used to discretize the random field of the spatially varied soil parameters the spatially varied soil property is characterized by a random field u x with mean μ x and covariance function c x 1 x 2 x is the spatial location and c x 1 x 2 can be expressed as 1 c x 1 x 2 i 1 λ i ϕ i x 1 ϕ i x 2 where ϕ i x and λ i are the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of c x 1 x 2 respectively in this study the exponential covariance function is adopted for random field simulation and can be expressed as 2 c x 1 x 2 σ 2 exp x 1 x 2 2 l h 2 y 1 y 2 2 l v 2 1 2 where σ 2 is the variance of u x l h and l v are the horizontal and vertical correlation length respectively the k l expansion of u x can be expressed as 3 u x μ x i 1 λ i θ i ϕ i x where θ i is the ith independent standard normal random variable 2 2 simulation of landslides with large deformation by cel method the cel method is based on the eulerian formulation the detailed eulerian formulation is available in previous studies benson 1992 benson and okazawa 2004 chen et al 2018 the mass momentum and energy equations are written as eqs 4 6 respectively 4 ρ t ρ v 0 5 ρ v t ρ v v σ ρ b 6 e t e v σ d ε d t where ρ is the density v is the material velocity σ is the cauchy stress b is the body force e is the internal energy per unit volume and ε is the strain rate respectively eqs 4 6 have a general form represented by eq 7 7 ψ t ψ s where ψ represents all the solution variables ψ is a flux function accounting for the convective effect and s represents a source term obviously eq 7 is both temporally and spatially dependent and it is decomposed into two sequent steps as eq 8 and eq 9 by the method of operator splitting benson and okazawa 2004 8 ψ t s 9 ψ t ψ 0 during a time step the lagrangian step eq 8 is firstly solved with the material attached to the mesh the eulerian step eq 9 is followed and the deformed mesh recovers along with the remapping of all the solution variables onto the regular mesh through the transport algorithm benson 1992 2 3 combination of the k l expansion method and the cel method to implement the proposed rcel method three important steps are implemented in the first step an initial model data file for the deterministic numerical analysis is created by abaqus which has incorporated the cel method in the next step run a matlab code of the k l expansion method to generate random field realizations of the computation domain which is discretized in regular grid in the last step the random field realizations are transmitted into the initial numerical model data file created in the first step according to the corresponding spatial relationship between random field grid and finite element mesh hence the stochastic analysis can be conducted in abaqus solver for all the random field realizations in the following sections the detailed procedures are described for illustration purpose a cel finite element mesh created in abaqus is shown in fig 2 and it is eulerian mesh with a set of regular rectangular grid fixed in the space the material domain shaded with a blue color is restricted in the mesh domain and the material can move between different elements under load such as gravity the elements outside the material belong to the void material domain the material movement can be tracked based on the volume fraction of each material within an element and its neighbors hirt and nichols 1981 in the cel model for deterministic analysis all the elements of the same material are assigned with the same property values e g the shear strength parameters in this study random field realizations of spatial varied properties are produced using the k l expansion method the domain is discretized into grids to represent spatial random variables but this discretization can be different from the finite element mesh according to literature the grid size of the random field can be equal to the element size of fem modeling huang and griffiths 2015 or different from the finite element size so that several finite elements share a same discretized random field value der kiureghian and ke 1988 li et al 2015 the discretization accuracy of random field is an important problem because information loss of random field would occur ching and phoon 2013 a finer random field mesh would be better but too many random variables would require more computation cost liu and liu 1993 ching and phoon 2013 the random field element size is mainly determined according to the correlation length of random field ching and phoon 2013 the economical size was recommended in previous studies one quarter to one half of the correlation length mahadevan and haldar 1991 johari et al 2015 huang and griffiths 2015 as shown in fig 2 the cel elements in this study are the reduced integral elements which have only one gauss integration point in the central position of the element therefore the random field grid mesh is designed based the gaussian points in the cel model and each random field grid is assigned with a material value using the k l method by running a matlab interface code the material value in each random field grid is transmitted into the corresponding gaussian integration point i e a position to position remapping process of the cel element through this remapping process one random realization is accurately re generated and no numerical diffusion occurs because no interpolation algorithm or approximation method is used during this process during the computation process of the stochastic analysis the integration point in every cel element has a different material value stresses are then updated for every cel element by justifying if the trial stress exceeds the magnitude of the undrained shear strength or not the cel fem has a second order accuracy as the traditional fem therefore the remapping of variables in eulerian step has an adequate accuracy and the random field properties in cel elements would keep a good preservation chen et al 2019 note that all the cel elements in both the material domain and the void material domain are assigned with specific material properties through the remapping process this is only for the simplification of matrix operations in the code programming the mapped property values of one realization outside the material domain are discarded during the numerical analysis automatically 3 validation example it is difficult to verify the large deformation ability of the proposed rcel method by directly modeling a spatially varied slope because almost no relevant experiments or benchmark simulations are available note that the proposed rcel method is completely same as the original cel method in the kernel algorithm the only difference between them lies in the assignment of the soil properties i e constant shear strength for the cel method and spatially varied shear strength for the rcel method input of different shear strengths however does not affect the validity of the kernel algorithm therefore we only need to demonstrate the validity of the original cel method a soil column collapse is simulated to validate the cel method by comparing with other large deformation methods in the literature the soil column is defined by a cohesion of 5 kpa a friction angle of 25 an elastic bulk modulus of 1 5 mpa and a density of 1850 kg m3 the initial geometry and the boundary conditions are described in fig 3 the cel method is used to simulate the behavior of the column collapse under gravity when the left boundary is released at time zero this same column collapse was also been studied by iaconeta et al 2017 using the material point method mpm and the galerkin meshfree method gmm and studied by bui et al 2008 using smooth particle hydrodynamics method sph all these results are presented in fig 4 it shows that all these large deformation methods can simulate the soil collapse and all can give similar deformation shapes as the collapse evolves therefore the cel method used in this paper can be effectively applied to geotechnical problems 4 numerical study the slope model shown in fig 5 a is considered which is in a plane strain state a regular spatially fixed mesh is divided into two regions by the slope geometry in the cel method the region filled with the slope is assigned with the soil material and the other is void elements the slope angle is 20 the undrained condition is often considered for submarine soft clays and the soil is usually be treated as a single phase continuum in previous studies dey et al 2015 dong et al 2017 therefore this study also adopts the undrained shear strength and considers its spatial variability in real situation the shear strength of soft marine sediments shows an extent of decrease during large deformation and a strength degradation model should be adopted however a linear elastic perfectly plastic constitutive model is used here because we adopted shear strength parameters to represent average shear strength of the marine soils as for consideration of multiple phases some researchers have reported about large deformation analysis with coupling of soil and water these previous studies can be classified into two groups based on the fundamental assumptions about the effect of fluids one group is multi phase flow analysis that the soil and the water are considered as two phases and hence the interaction between two materials can be considered for example pudasaini 2012 proposed a generalized two phase debris flow model in which the solid soil behaves mohr coulomb plasticity and the water is a non newtonian fluid pudasaini and fischer 2020 extended the two phase model to simulate the phase separation in debris flow in the second group of analysis the soil water interaction is considered using a mixture model or a porous media model hence the domain of the problem contains one material with variables of solid and fluids interacted for example jassim et al 2013 and wang et al 2018b developed a coupled mpm based on a v w formulation in which solid and fluid velocities v w are the primary variables the position of solid soil was updated based on the velocity of the solid phase and the water velocity was used for the calculation of pore pressure similar strategies in previous literature can be extended in the present rcel method to consider a more complex physical process in which the soil water behavior and spatial variability are both coupled for further study in this study the soil has a mean undrained shear strength s u of 35 kpa the density of the saturated clay soil is 2 g cm3 the young s modulus of the soil is 10 mpa and the poisson s ratio is 0 4 the slope bottom is fixed and the slipping path in front of the slope is assumed to be smooth without friction and the vertical direction is restricted so that the slipping soil would not drop out of the bottom boundary under the action of the gravity the right boundary of the slope is restricted in the horizontal direction according to griffiths and fenton 2004 and jiang et al 2014 the ratio of the element size to the correlation length should be sufficiently small to ensure the accuracy of reliability results when the spatial variability is considered in this study the element size of 0 6 m 0 625 m is adopted to compromise between accuracy and computational cost as suggested by jiang et al 2014 the slope is stable if only gravity is turned on to simulate the failure induced by earthquakes or volcanoes an assumed inertia force with the horizontal left direction is exerted on the entire slope the inertia force is usually defined by a multiplication factor of the ground peak acceleration according to trifunac and brady 1976 the peak horizontal ground acceleration pga is mainly associated with the earthquake magnitude the position away from the fault and other natural factors such as the slope topography and soil properties swaisgood 2003 reviewed the effect of a series of earthquakes on settlements of embankment dams around the world and gave groups of measured relation between the pga and other parameters for example 30 km away from the fault with a magnitude 7 5 produced a pga of 0 2 g the combination of 13 km away from the fault with a magnitude 7 1 produced a pga of 0 38 g in this study the pga is assumed as 0 26 g to simulate an extreme landslides hazard and its active time is set to be 4 5 s during which time the horizontal peak acceleration is exerted on the whole slope the impact force on the pipeline is studied the diameter of submarine pipelines generally ranges from 0 1 m to 1 m zakeri et al 2008 and we assume the diameter as 1 m in this study the pipeline regarded as a rigid body is located in front of the slope and it overlaps with the eulerian mesh however the pipeline has its own mesh 5 elements that is a lagrangian form and the pipeline mesh has no interrelationship with the eulerian mesh until the soil reaches the pipeline when the soil contacts the pipeline the pipeline lagrangian mesh interacts with the eulerian mesh during the lagrangian step i e eq 8 of each time increment step therefore the contact between them is similar with the contact of two lagrangian body in traditional fe analysis the soil pipeline interaction is considered with the contact surface approach of coulomb friction which has been widely used in soil structure analysis daiyan et al 2011 roy et al 2015 the friction coefficient of 0 5 is defined between the pipeline and soil sliding occurs if the shear stress on the contact surface exceeds the critical shear stress which is the product of friction coefficient and the contact normal pressure the random field of undrained shear strength which is assumed to be log normally distributed is shown in fig 5 b and mapped onto the regular spatially fixed mesh in fig 5 a to perform a numerical analysis in this study the effects of cov of undrained shear strength s u and the correlation lengths on the probability distribution of the impact force on the pipeline are investigated consider the response of the system i e the runout distance or the impact force on the pipeline is g u the error in estimating the mean response of the system μ g decreases when the number of realizations of the random field increases the number of realizations n that keeps the estimation of the mean response within an error of e r with confidence 1 α is controlled by fenton and griffiths 2008 10 n z α 2 σ g e r 2 where z α 2 is the value of the standard normal variable corresponding to a cumulative probability of 1 α 2 and σ g is the standard deviation of the response g u if the maximum error e r is allowed within 0 1σ g to 0 2σ g with a confidence of 90 the required number of realizations is between 68 and 271 in this study two hundred realizations are performed to ensure stable statistical results and efficient computation performance because different random material properties are adopted in realizations the computation performance is not completely same for every realization computation the mean time consumed is about 25 min per realization computation when the hardware configuration of intel cpu i7 6700 and memory 16g is used fig 6 shows the deformation evolution of the homogeneous soil slope s u 35 kpa where the peeq represents the equivalent plastic strain under the action of both the vertical gravity and the horizontal inertia force the slope slips along a thin shear band located at the lower boundary of the slope fig 6 c describes the ultimate state of interaction between the failed soil and the pipeline that is located on the flow path of the failed slope debris fig 7 shows the variation of impact forces on the pipeline with time the impact force is obtained by integration of all the shear stresses and normal pressures on the interface of the pipeline and soil the red curve represents the evolution of the impact force for the homogeneous slope the horizontal impact force as shown in fig 7 a suddenly increases to a value when the failed soil reaches the pipeline and finally reduces to a stable value with the stop of the soil movement in fig 7 b the vertical impact force for the homogeneous slope gradually increases to a positive value downward direction is positive the red curve in fig 7 c represents the resultant impact force obtained by square sum of the horizontal and vertical impact force the resultant impact force has approximately a similar evolution tendency with the horizontal impact force this indicates the horizontal impact force has a dominated role in the interaction of moving soil and the pipeline the impact force is affected by the spatially random soil property as shown in fig 7 the blue circular marks in fig 7 represent the stochastic analysis results for 200 realizations with cov 0 1 l h 10 m and l v 1 m fig 7 a and c show that both the horizontal and resultant impact forces from a spatially varied soil landslide evolve generally similarly to that in the homogeneous slope however in fig 7 b the vertical impact force from a spatially random soil landslide can be negative i e upward direction to explain this phenomenon fig 8 gives the vertical impact forces that correspond to three typical realizations cov 0 1 l h 10 m and l v 1 m as shown in fig 9 the spatially varied slope determined by realization 1 visibly has a high strength zone at the toe as in fig 9 a and therefore the slope deformation in the whole slipping process is small the failed soil only moves to right beside the pipeline and contributes an upward lift force on the pipeline as shown in fig 8 for realization 2 the soils with larger strength is distributed in areas far away from the slope toe and the strength around the toe is smaller than 35 kpa as shown in fig 9 b therefore a larger deformation is obtained the pipeline is fully buried by a large volume of failed soil which generates a downward vertical impact force positive value in the most slipping time of the slope for realization 3 the spatially varied slope is similar to realization 2 but has a smaller average strength therefore the slope has a larger deformation than that of realization 2 the failed soil that has run over the pipeline moves further forward as shown in fig 9 c this again gives an upward dragging force on the pipeline that can resist the downward force induced by the inertial effect of buried soil volume therefore the vertical impact force corresponding to realization 3 in fig 8 gradually decreases from a positive value to about zero during the later slipping process these results indicate that the vertical impact force is sensitive to the different deformation processes for spatially varied slopes and is easier to behave in a fluctuation form although the vertical impact force is obviously lower than the horizontal impact force its fluctuation feature may damage pipeline with a fatigue failure due to stress concentration fan et al 2018 guo et al 2019 alamilla et al 2013 as the maximum value of the resultant impact force is most useful for the limit state design in engineering practice all the maximum values for the 200 realizations of spatially varied slopes are calculated and the statistical distributions are obtained subsequently the failure probability of the pipeline is quantitatively evaluated based on the statistical maximum impact forces and failure criteria the failure of pipeline depends on many factors such as the pipeline laying method the attack angle of flowing soil mass the environmental stress corrosion guo et al 2019 liu et al 2015 alamilla et al 2013 cunha et al 2009 and etc a proper failure criterion should be chosen based on design purposes and engineering experiences in this study we consider two common failure modes of submarine pipelines i e buckling failure and yield failure the critical value of distributed pressure of a pipeline for elastic buckling is timoshenko and gere 2009 11 p c r 2 e p 1 v p 2 δ d 3 where p cr is the critical value of the uniformly distributed pressure on pipeline e p and v p is the elastic modulus 210 gpa and poisson s ratio of pipeline 0 3 of the pipeline api 5l grade x65 respectively d is the external diameter of pipeline and δ is the wall thickness of the pipeline therefore the limit state function of the buckling failure is defined as 12 f 1 q a p c r where q is the uniformly distributed impact force per unit length along the axial direction of the pipeline and a is the projected area along the direction of landslide impact when f 1 0 no buckling of pipeline occurs otherwise the pipeline fails with buckling for the plastic yield failure mode we assume the pipeline is laid perpendicularly relative to the impact direction of the landslide the impact force uniformly distributes along the pipeline axial direction given that the landslide size in the pipeline axial direction is large enough as in fig 10 a the submarine pipelines generally need protection technologies such as ripraps sandbag filling concrete cover and short pile support chiew 1992 guo et al 2019 a multi spanned continuous beam model may be more realistic for the submarine pipeline however the number of influenced spans relies on how large the landslides area is and therefore the present rcel method should be extended to a 3d application in this study we only consider the problem as a plane strain condition and assume the pipeline supported by concrete covers as a simply supported beam fig 10 b according to the previous studies dermendjianivanova 1992 peng et al 2018 the critical bending moment of a simply supported beam is higher than that of a multi spanned continuous beam model so that a conservative result of risk assessment would be obtained constraints on both sides represent concrete covers and the distance between two nearest covers is l the mid section of the pipeline bears a maximum bending moment and the maximum tensile stress lies on the outermost side of pipeline circle section the maximum bending moment m is calculated as 13 m q l 2 8 where l is the distance between two nearest covers the maximum tensile stress σ t can be obtained by 14 σ t m w w π d 3 32 1 d 2 δ d 4 where w is the section modulus of bending hence the limit state function for the yield failure can be defined as 15 f 2 σ t σ y where σ y is the yield stress of the material of pipeline and it varies between about 200 mpa and 500 mpa for different grades of steel o rourke and liu 2011 here we assume the yield stress σ y 450 mpa for the pipeline steel api 5l grade x65 when f 2 0 the pipeline is safe with no yielding otherwise the pipeline yields the impact force per unit length q in eqs 11 and 13 corresponding to each sample of the stochastic analysis is obtained then the obtained maximum impact forces are substituted into eq 12 and eq 15 to evaluate the failure probability of the pipeline for the failure modes of buckling failure and yield failure the pipeline failure probability p f is obtained by computing the total percentage of f 1 0 or f 2 0 16 p f n f i 0 n t i 1 2 where n f i 0 represents the number of failures in total of n t samples note that only impact force of the landslide is considered when computing the p f in reality the gravity of pipeline and the passive earth pressure induced by soil pipeline interaction would also influence the probability of failure in this study the gravity of the pipeline is neglected because it is around two order magnitude smaller than the landslide impact the passive earth pressure may dismiss because the soil supporting the pipeline may be washed away by vortex induced vibration zhang et al 2016 hence the passive earth pressure can be omitted to get a conservative result 4 1 effect of cov of shear strength on landslide impact of pipeline research studies of characterization of spatial variability for marine soils are relatively limited tang 1979 yoon et al 2004 yi et al 2019 liu et al 2017 researchers phoon and kulhawy 1999 found that there is no significant difference in spatial variability between land and shallow marine sediments according to the research by phoon and kulhawy 1999 the average vertical correlation length of the undrained shear strength is about 2 5 m and the average horizontal correlation length is more than one order magnitude larger than the vertical i e about 50 7 m in the horizontal direction the cov of s u generally lies between 0 1 and 0 3 to study the effect of cov of s u on the landslide behaviors the cov of s u varies from 0 1 to 0 3 with constant values of l h 10 m and l v 1m fig 11 a c illustrate the evolution of resultant impact force for different covs of s u the 90 uncertainty bounds marked by dotted lines and the mean values are also plotted with solid black lines it shows that the mean value is greater than the deterministic value corresponding to the homogeneous slope at an early time of landslide impact which indicates that the spatially varied slope is easier to reach the failure state and has an earlier collision with the pipeline during the later interaction process the mean value approximately agrees with the deterministic value however with the increasing of cov of s u from 0 1 to 0 3 the final stable value of the mean impact force has a tendency to be smaller than the final stable deterministic value of the impact force the reason is that the number of realizations of spatially varied slope with extremely large or low strength will obviously rise when the cov of s u varies from 0 1 to 0 3 for example the upper uncertainty bound has an increasing tendency and the lower uncertainty bound obviously approaches zero as shown from fig 11 especially in fig 11 c the zero impact force accounts for at least 5 of the total 200 realizations this indicates the occurring frequency of two extreme deformation results increases i e the small scale of deformation and the large scale of deformation the former leads to nearly no soil collision with the pipeline and the probability of impact forces approaching zero will rise while the latter leads to further runout distance and the final thickness of debris that buries on the pipeline will be thinner due to mass conservation though the failed soil may generate a very large impact force during the early sliding stage for this case the final stable impact force would show a considerably smaller value the corresponding distributions of maximum impact force are plotted on fig 11 d f with cov of s u increasing from 0 1 to 0 3 the result shows that the standard deviation of maximum impact force increases with the cov of s u by dividing the standard deviation by the mean value the cov of the maximum impact force can be obtained as 0 28 0 42 and 0 49 respectively this shows the uncertainty of the maximum impact force is significantly enlarged when the cov of s u increases fig 11 d shows the distribution of the maximum impact force is similar to the gaussian distribution when the uncertainty of the field is small cov 0 1 however the distribution shapes are not gaussian types when the cov of undrained shear strength increases to 0 2 and 0 3 in fig 11 f the distribution has two peaks that might be related to different failure modes of the landslides fig 12 presents some examples of different failure modes for spatially varied slopes the failure modes can be classified into three types local failure with a shallow slip surface global failure with a deep seated slip surface and bedding failure with the deformation restricted by the bedrock these complex failure modes will generate different collision effects on the pipeline and they are the main factors to cause multiple peaks distribution when cov of s u is large in addition we notice from fig 12 that more slumping behavior of the soil is observed and the soil separation along the shear band is not obvious enough when comparing with the deformation result in dey et al 2015 in which the cel method was also used the major reason of more slumping behavior in this study lies on the adopted constitutive model where no strain softening effect is considered previous studies based on the cel large deformation analysis demonstrated that other influencing factors in addition to the softening behavior of marine soils would contribute the failure modes of landslides for example dey et al 2015 simulated the deformation process of a slope with a sensitive clay underlying a stronger crust they used a softening undrained shear strength i e softening tresca yield criterion in the sensitive clay but no softening as in this study i e tresca yield criterion in the crust layer the simulations showed that only the cases with a certain thickness of the crust can cause a retrogressive failure mode even when the softening of the clay layer is considered for the case with a very thin crust less than 1 m only the global failure with one shear band was observed the sensitivity and the slope angle are also important for the failure modes however with considering of softening behavior actually more obvious soil separation along the shear band was observed in dey et al 2015 therefore the constitution model and the soil profiles assumed in the example problem of this study may suppress the separation along the shear band relatively it should be mentioned that comparing with the continuous mechanics based numerical methods such as the cel method in this study the particle based methods such as sph dem and mpm are better to simulate the soil separation because of their inherent advantages to deal with the non continuum deformation wang et al 2018 2019 guo and zhao 2014 another reason for the slumping behavior may be the horizontal seismic load applied on the slope in this study in dey et al 2015 only static gravity loads were considered however the horizontal seismic load applied on the slope can cause a more obvious slumping of the whole soil mass 4 2 effect of correlation lengths on the soil pipeline interaction to study the effect of correlation lengths on the landslide behaviors the horizontal and vertical correlation lengths are changed in the spatially varied slope considering constant vertical correlation length as 2 m and cov of s u as 0 1 the horizontal correlation length l h decreases from 60 m to 20 m and the distribution of maximum impact force on pipeline is plotted on fig 13 for spatially varied slopes the mean value the standard deviation and the cov of the maximum impact force are shown in fig 14 a c the mean value generally remains constant when l h varies but is larger than the deterministic value the standard deviation does not vary much when l h decreases from 60 m to 20 m but decreases significantly when l h reduces to less than 20 m the cov of the maximum impact force as in fig 14 c also shows a decreasing tendency similar to the standard deviation when l h decreases when l v varies from 1 m to 10 m l h 10 m and cov of s u 0 1 the calculated results of the statistical values as shown in fig 14 e and f the results reveal that variation of the vertical correlation length has little influence on the mean value the standard deviation and the cov of the maximum impact force these above results indicate the uncertainty of the maximum impact force is significantly reduced when l h decreases but shows no significant change when l v varies the failure feature of the slope can explain this observation as shown in fig 12 the slope mainly slips along a thin and long shear band in the horizontal direction when failure occurs therefore the variation of the horizontal correlation length can significantly affect the spatial distribution of the undrained shear strength along the shear band for example in fig 15 a two realizations of slopes with cov 0 1 l h 40 m l v 2 m is presented these realizations show horizontally layers which have similar shear strengths in the entire horizontal direction it can lead to either too large or too small shear strength in the major part of the landslide which can increase the uncertainty of slope deformation and runout distance and in turn increase the uncertainty of the maximum impact force when the horizontal correlation length decreases to the value of 2 m as shown in fig 15 b the random field generates scatter varied strength values in the entire horizontal direction the spatial average effect of undrained shear strength in horizontal direction would be more prominent therefore the uncertainty of the maximum impact force can be significantly reduced due to spatial average effect on the other hand the variation of the vertical correlation length is not easy to change the probability distribution of the undrained shear strength in a thin shear band therefore the uncertainty of the maximum impact force varies little when the vertical correlation length changes 4 3 comparison of stochastic and deterministic analyses all the results in figs 12 and 13 show that the mean values of the maximum impact force from spatially varied landslides are larger than the deterministic value of a homogeneous slope the proportions of the maximum impact force that exceeds the deterministic value are listed in table 1 the proportion is generally between 52 and 67 which is a considerable large probability the result indicates the potential impact force may be significantly underestimated in a deterministic analysis 4 4 evaluation of pipeline failure based on two failure criteria as mentioned above two failure criteria i e buckling failure criterion and yield failure criterion are adopted to evaluate the pipeline failure probability based on the distribution of maximum impact force fig 16 shows variations of pipeline failure probability with the wall thickness when considering buckling failure for different spatially varied slopes the failure probability has a similar trend that decreases with the wall thickness δ if the acceptable failure probability of buckling is 0 005 corresponding to a target reliability index of 2 6 the wall thickness δ should be greater than 10 5 mm however δ is only 8 6 mm for a homogeneous slope the failure probability corresponding to δ 8 6 mm is about 0 6 as shown in fig 16 this result reveals that pipeline design with a deterministic analysis would suffer a 60 probability of buckling failure and this demonstrates the importance of considering spatial variability as demonstrated in sections 4 1 and 4 2 the increases of the cov and horizontal correlation length of s u will enlarge the uncertainty of the maximum impact force the number of extreme values of the impact force would increase when the cov or the horizontal correlation length of s u increase consequently as shown in fig 16 for weak pipelines with small values of δ the probability of failure is greater than 0 5 the failure probability decreases with the increase of cov of s u or l h because fewer realizations reach the threshold of buckling failure the failure probability however increases for strong pipelines with large values of δ because the probability of failure is less than 0 5 and more realizations can exceed the failure threshold as the cov of s u or l h increases fig 17 shows envelopes of failure probability corresponding to plastic yield failure the graph is for the case with cov of s u 0 1 l h 60 m and l v 2 m envelopes corresponding to other cases are similar to fig 17 consider p f 0 005 as the acceptable failure probability the combinations of l and δ located below the solid black line is acceptable to avoid the plastic yielding failure the dash lines represent situations with different failure probabilities the envelope obtained by the deterministic analysis is slightly below the line with p f 0 6 it reveals deterministic pipeline design would suffer a yielding failure probability of around 60 the yielding failure envelopes are influenced by the characteristics values of spatial variability as shown in fig 18 however for a pipeline with a given thickness and a design failure probability p f 0 005 the alteration in design envelopes due to different spatial varied fields is not significant different spatial varied fields give an almost consistent critical failure envelope for pipeline design in the stochastic analysis the buckling failure criterion determines a safe region of wall thickness i e δ 10 5 mm and the yielding failure criterion determines another safe region below the envelope marked by p f 0 005 therefore the safety design of pipeline should locate within the intersection of these two safe regions as shown in fig 19 the graph also shows the safety region obtained by deterministic analysis the result demonstrates that the deterministic analysis will lead to an unsafe design of the submarine pipeline and more risk may be induced if spatial variability is not considered 5 concluding remarks a random coupled eulerian lagrangian method rcel for stochastic analysis of large deformation behaviors of the landslide is proposed in this study the entire failure process of landslides and the subsequent impact on pipelines are investigated the major findings are summarized as follows 1 under the action of the vertical gravity and horizontal inertia force the failure modes in spatially varied slopes become complex with the increased values of cov 0 1 0 3 of undrained shear strength the local failure with a shallow slip surface the global failure with a deeply seated slip surface and the bedding failure with the deformation restricted by the bedrock can be found in spatially varied slopes with a larger cov 2 the uncertainty of the maximum impact force increases with the cov of the undrained shear strength while the mean value only changes slightly the uncertainty of the maximum impact force generally decreases with the reduction of horizontal correlation length due to spatial averaging effect along the horizontal slip surface this reduction of uncertainty is most significant when l h is smaller than 20 m however the vertical correlation length does not affect the uncertainty of the maximum impact force 3 the mean impact forces are larger than that of the homogenous slope the proportion of the maximum impact force that exceeds the deterministic value is between 52 and 67 this result implies that a deterministic analysis would significantly underestimate the potential impact risk induced by slope failure even if the deterministic analysis adopted large deformation simulation 4 for an acceptable failure probability of 0 005 the wall thickness should be greater than 10 5 mm for the buckling failure the yielding failure criterion determines combinations of l and δ within a certain safe region a deterministic design would suffer around 60 probability of failure if spatial variability is not considered this study provides a unified numerical method that can comprehensively assess the landslide uncertainty and the subsequent impact risk on pipelines one of the limitations of the present work is that a linear elastic perfectly plastic soil model is used in this study the shear strength of soft clay can be influenced by complicated inherent characteristics such as large strain rate rocchi et al 2003 dong et al 2017 and sensitivity yafrate et al 2009 lunne et al 2010 another limitation is that the proposed method cannot consider the effect of waves and flows on the soil and pipelines the coupling of soil and water or mixture of soil with seawater may affect the deformation of the submarine landslide liu et al 2015 in future study advanced constitutive models and numerical simulations considering the above complex characteristics and behaviors of marine clays should be used to reproduce

21483,in situ soil properties exhibit natural spatial variability in this study the karhunen loève k l expansion method and the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method are integrated to simulate large deformation behavior of slopes with spatially varied shear strengths the impact on pipelines induced by spatially varied landslides is investigated the mean value of the maximum impact force is significantly larger than the deterministic value obtained for a homogeneous slope the proportion of the maximum impact force from stochastic analysis that exceeds the deterministic value is much greater than 50 this result shows that the deterministic study can significantly underestimate the damage of pipeline by a landslide if the spatial variability is not considered the uncertainty of the impact force increases with the coefficient of variation cov of the undrained shear strength and decreases with the reduction of horizontal correlation length by considering buckling failure and plastic yielding failure of pipelines the failure probabilities are assessed and a pipeline design based on stochastic analysis for spatially varied slope is presented keywords random field coupled eulerian lagrangian method large deformation landslide impact force failure of pipeline 1 introduction submarine landslide is a large deformation and dynamic process that can cause serious damage to offshore installations such as pipelines studies of the large deformation process of submarine landslides and the interaction between landslides and offshore pipelines are extremely essential to the safety design in practical engineering previous studies mainly used the fluid mechanics approach and the geotechnical approach to simulate the soil pipeline interaction the fluid mechanics method regards the soil mass as an incompressible viscous fluid zakeri 2009 zakeri et al 2009 fan et al 2018 liu et al 2015 rheological models such as bingham herschel bulkley and other non newtonian fluids laws are used to describe the rate dependent shear strength of the soil fan et al 2018 guo et al 2019 the drag force on the pipeline caused by the soil fluid is computed in terms of a drag coefficient associated with the non newtonian reynolds number dong et al 2017 the drag force obtained by the fluid mechanics approach usually works well at a moderate or high velocity of the slide because the inertial effect is dominant at high velocity however the geotechnical resistance related to the shear strength mainly affects the drag force on pipelines and the inertial effect is negligible when the sliding velocity is low randolph and white 2012 dong et al 2017 therefore under the situation of low sliding velocity the geotechnical approach that directly links the drag force with the shear strength is more appropriate to simulate the interaction between landslides and pipelines randolph and white 2012 liu et al 2015 note that the previous studies on the interaction between landslides and pipelines mentioned above are all deterministic analyses the sliding mass is usually considered with a constant volume an assumed slip surface and an initial sliding velocity the uncertainty of landslide due to natural variability of soil properties is not considered the complex process of soil deposition may introduce different distributions of soil fabric over space which can cause the spatial variability of soil properties degroot and baecher 1993 dasaka and zhang 2012 allahverdizadeh et al 2016 ching et al 2016 lacasse et al 2017 ering and sivakumar babu 2017 papaioannou and straub 2017 yong et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 fig 1 shows the fundamental geotechnical properties of the soft marine clay in pusan of korea tanaka et al 2001 soil compositions soil density liquid limit wl plastic limit wp natural water content wn and strengths from cpt and field vane tests are presented the soil properties fluctuate with violent or mild deviations along the depth which indicates the existence of the natural spatial variability of soil spatially varied shear strength in soil may affect the failure mode of a landslide li et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 different failure modes may cause different slip surfaces volumes of sliding mass and sliding velocities which finally affect the impact force on the pipeline therefore the spatial variability of soil properties should be considered properly in the soil pipeline interaction analysis a probabilistic method is of more advantages than the deterministic method to address this kind of problem and the statistic results can be used in the risk assessment about the damage caused by soil pipeline interaction probabilistic methods considering spatial variability have been conducted in slope stability analysis the random limit equilibrium method rlem and random finite element method rfem are typical methods which combine the random theory with the widely used slope stability analysis methods for example the rlem was used to evaluate the probabilistic distribution of factors of safety and potential slip surfaces in a slope cho 2007 zhu et al 2018 the rfem is not only able to evaluate the probabilistic distribution of factors of safety but also able to describe the evolutions of stresses and strains in spatially varied slopes griffiths and fenton 2004 li et al 2015 javankhoshdel et al 2017 luo and bathurst 2018 however these methods cannot address the post failure stage characterized by large deformation therefore a large deformation method incorporated with the random theory is needed to quantify the probabilistic distributions of the runout behavior of a submarine landslide and the subsequent impact force on pipeline at present many large deformation numerical methods such as discrete element method dem smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph and material point method mpm have been applied in the simulation of landslides mcdougall 2016 chen et al 2018 mohammadi and taiebat 2013 lu et al 2014 guo and zhao 2014 pastor et al 2009 wang et al 2018a dong et al 2017 however homogeneous slopes are often considered in these previous studies the investigations about large deformation analysis coupled with spatial variability are emerged recently wang et al 2019 proposed a random smoothed particle hydrodynamics rsph combining random field with smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph with which method the failure probability influence zone and volume of sliding mass during slope post failure were estimated zhang et al 2020 investigated the variability effect of internal friction angle on the slope post failure based on rsph wang et al 2016 2017 adopted the rmpm random material point method that combines mpm with the random field to study the large deformation failure of the slope considering spatial variability the heterogeneity was shown to have a significant effect on the evolution of the slope failure mechanism e g the retrogression failure and random modeling based on the traditional small strain fem analyses would yield un conservative results liu et al 2019 combined the random field with both lem and mpm to form a rle mpm framework to improve the computational efficiency of rmpm in this study the dynamic impact behavior on a pipeline induced by a submarine landslide considering natural spatial variability of soil properties is investigated in a probabilistic framework the karhunen loève k l expansion method and the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method are integrated to simulate large deformation behaviors of spatially varied slopes the proposed method is named as random coupled eulerian lagrangian rcel method a numerical example is presented to investigate the effect of spatial variability on failure modes of landslides and the impact force on pipelines the results of the stochastic analyses are compared with the deterministic result to demonstrate the importance of spatial variability 2 the random coupled eulerian lagrangian rcel method 2 1 generation of realizations for spatial varied soil properties with k l expansion the k l expansion method li and der kiureghian 1993 sudret and der kiureghian 2000 yang et al 2019 is used to discretize the random field of the spatially varied soil parameters the spatially varied soil property is characterized by a random field u x with mean μ x and covariance function c x 1 x 2 x is the spatial location and c x 1 x 2 can be expressed as 1 c x 1 x 2 i 1 λ i ϕ i x 1 ϕ i x 2 where ϕ i x and λ i are the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of c x 1 x 2 respectively in this study the exponential covariance function is adopted for random field simulation and can be expressed as 2 c x 1 x 2 σ 2 exp x 1 x 2 2 l h 2 y 1 y 2 2 l v 2 1 2 where σ 2 is the variance of u x l h and l v are the horizontal and vertical correlation length respectively the k l expansion of u x can be expressed as 3 u x μ x i 1 λ i θ i ϕ i x where θ i is the ith independent standard normal random variable 2 2 simulation of landslides with large deformation by cel method the cel method is based on the eulerian formulation the detailed eulerian formulation is available in previous studies benson 1992 benson and okazawa 2004 chen et al 2018 the mass momentum and energy equations are written as eqs 4 6 respectively 4 ρ t ρ v 0 5 ρ v t ρ v v σ ρ b 6 e t e v σ d ε d t where ρ is the density v is the material velocity σ is the cauchy stress b is the body force e is the internal energy per unit volume and ε is the strain rate respectively eqs 4 6 have a general form represented by eq 7 7 ψ t ψ s where ψ represents all the solution variables ψ is a flux function accounting for the convective effect and s represents a source term obviously eq 7 is both temporally and spatially dependent and it is decomposed into two sequent steps as eq 8 and eq 9 by the method of operator splitting benson and okazawa 2004 8 ψ t s 9 ψ t ψ 0 during a time step the lagrangian step eq 8 is firstly solved with the material attached to the mesh the eulerian step eq 9 is followed and the deformed mesh recovers along with the remapping of all the solution variables onto the regular mesh through the transport algorithm benson 1992 2 3 combination of the k l expansion method and the cel method to implement the proposed rcel method three important steps are implemented in the first step an initial model data file for the deterministic numerical analysis is created by abaqus which has incorporated the cel method in the next step run a matlab code of the k l expansion method to generate random field realizations of the computation domain which is discretized in regular grid in the last step the random field realizations are transmitted into the initial numerical model data file created in the first step according to the corresponding spatial relationship between random field grid and finite element mesh hence the stochastic analysis can be conducted in abaqus solver for all the random field realizations in the following sections the detailed procedures are described for illustration purpose a cel finite element mesh created in abaqus is shown in fig 2 and it is eulerian mesh with a set of regular rectangular grid fixed in the space the material domain shaded with a blue color is restricted in the mesh domain and the material can move between different elements under load such as gravity the elements outside the material belong to the void material domain the material movement can be tracked based on the volume fraction of each material within an element and its neighbors hirt and nichols 1981 in the cel model for deterministic analysis all the elements of the same material are assigned with the same property values e g the shear strength parameters in this study random field realizations of spatial varied properties are produced using the k l expansion method the domain is discretized into grids to represent spatial random variables but this discretization can be different from the finite element mesh according to literature the grid size of the random field can be equal to the element size of fem modeling huang and griffiths 2015 or different from the finite element size so that several finite elements share a same discretized random field value der kiureghian and ke 1988 li et al 2015 the discretization accuracy of random field is an important problem because information loss of random field would occur ching and phoon 2013 a finer random field mesh would be better but too many random variables would require more computation cost liu and liu 1993 ching and phoon 2013 the random field element size is mainly determined according to the correlation length of random field ching and phoon 2013 the economical size was recommended in previous studies one quarter to one half of the correlation length mahadevan and haldar 1991 johari et al 2015 huang and griffiths 2015 as shown in fig 2 the cel elements in this study are the reduced integral elements which have only one gauss integration point in the central position of the element therefore the random field grid mesh is designed based the gaussian points in the cel model and each random field grid is assigned with a material value using the k l method by running a matlab interface code the material value in each random field grid is transmitted into the corresponding gaussian integration point i e a position to position remapping process of the cel element through this remapping process one random realization is accurately re generated and no numerical diffusion occurs because no interpolation algorithm or approximation method is used during this process during the computation process of the stochastic analysis the integration point in every cel element has a different material value stresses are then updated for every cel element by justifying if the trial stress exceeds the magnitude of the undrained shear strength or not the cel fem has a second order accuracy as the traditional fem therefore the remapping of variables in eulerian step has an adequate accuracy and the random field properties in cel elements would keep a good preservation chen et al 2019 note that all the cel elements in both the material domain and the void material domain are assigned with specific material properties through the remapping process this is only for the simplification of matrix operations in the code programming the mapped property values of one realization outside the material domain are discarded during the numerical analysis automatically 3 validation example it is difficult to verify the large deformation ability of the proposed rcel method by directly modeling a spatially varied slope because almost no relevant experiments or benchmark simulations are available note that the proposed rcel method is completely same as the original cel method in the kernel algorithm the only difference between them lies in the assignment of the soil properties i e constant shear strength for the cel method and spatially varied shear strength for the rcel method input of different shear strengths however does not affect the validity of the kernel algorithm therefore we only need to demonstrate the validity of the original cel method a soil column collapse is simulated to validate the cel method by comparing with other large deformation methods in the literature the soil column is defined by a cohesion of 5 kpa a friction angle of 25 an elastic bulk modulus of 1 5 mpa and a density of 1850 kg m3 the initial geometry and the boundary conditions are described in fig 3 the cel method is used to simulate the behavior of the column collapse under gravity when the left boundary is released at time zero this same column collapse was also been studied by iaconeta et al 2017 using the material point method mpm and the galerkin meshfree method gmm and studied by bui et al 2008 using smooth particle hydrodynamics method sph all these results are presented in fig 4 it shows that all these large deformation methods can simulate the soil collapse and all can give similar deformation shapes as the collapse evolves therefore the cel method used in this paper can be effectively applied to geotechnical problems 4 numerical study the slope model shown in fig 5 a is considered which is in a plane strain state a regular spatially fixed mesh is divided into two regions by the slope geometry in the cel method the region filled with the slope is assigned with the soil material and the other is void elements the slope angle is 20 the undrained condition is often considered for submarine soft clays and the soil is usually be treated as a single phase continuum in previous studies dey et al 2015 dong et al 2017 therefore this study also adopts the undrained shear strength and considers its spatial variability in real situation the shear strength of soft marine sediments shows an extent of decrease during large deformation and a strength degradation model should be adopted however a linear elastic perfectly plastic constitutive model is used here because we adopted shear strength parameters to represent average shear strength of the marine soils as for consideration of multiple phases some researchers have reported about large deformation analysis with coupling of soil and water these previous studies can be classified into two groups based on the fundamental assumptions about the effect of fluids one group is multi phase flow analysis that the soil and the water are considered as two phases and hence the interaction between two materials can be considered for example pudasaini 2012 proposed a generalized two phase debris flow model in which the solid soil behaves mohr coulomb plasticity and the water is a non newtonian fluid pudasaini and fischer 2020 extended the two phase model to simulate the phase separation in debris flow in the second group of analysis the soil water interaction is considered using a mixture model or a porous media model hence the domain of the problem contains one material with variables of solid and fluids interacted for example jassim et al 2013 and wang et al 2018b developed a coupled mpm based on a v w formulation in which solid and fluid velocities v w are the primary variables the position of solid soil was updated based on the velocity of the solid phase and the water velocity was used for the calculation of pore pressure similar strategies in previous literature can be extended in the present rcel method to consider a more complex physical process in which the soil water behavior and spatial variability are both coupled for further study in this study the soil has a mean undrained shear strength s u of 35 kpa the density of the saturated clay soil is 2 g cm3 the young s modulus of the soil is 10 mpa and the poisson s ratio is 0 4 the slope bottom is fixed and the slipping path in front of the slope is assumed to be smooth without friction and the vertical direction is restricted so that the slipping soil would not drop out of the bottom boundary under the action of the gravity the right boundary of the slope is restricted in the horizontal direction according to griffiths and fenton 2004 and jiang et al 2014 the ratio of the element size to the correlation length should be sufficiently small to ensure the accuracy of reliability results when the spatial variability is considered in this study the element size of 0 6 m 0 625 m is adopted to compromise between accuracy and computational cost as suggested by jiang et al 2014 the slope is stable if only gravity is turned on to simulate the failure induced by earthquakes or volcanoes an assumed inertia force with the horizontal left direction is exerted on the entire slope the inertia force is usually defined by a multiplication factor of the ground peak acceleration according to trifunac and brady 1976 the peak horizontal ground acceleration pga is mainly associated with the earthquake magnitude the position away from the fault and other natural factors such as the slope topography and soil properties swaisgood 2003 reviewed the effect of a series of earthquakes on settlements of embankment dams around the world and gave groups of measured relation between the pga and other parameters for example 30 km away from the fault with a magnitude 7 5 produced a pga of 0 2 g the combination of 13 km away from the fault with a magnitude 7 1 produced a pga of 0 38 g in this study the pga is assumed as 0 26 g to simulate an extreme landslides hazard and its active time is set to be 4 5 s during which time the horizontal peak acceleration is exerted on the whole slope the impact force on the pipeline is studied the diameter of submarine pipelines generally ranges from 0 1 m to 1 m zakeri et al 2008 and we assume the diameter as 1 m in this study the pipeline regarded as a rigid body is located in front of the slope and it overlaps with the eulerian mesh however the pipeline has its own mesh 5 elements that is a lagrangian form and the pipeline mesh has no interrelationship with the eulerian mesh until the soil reaches the pipeline when the soil contacts the pipeline the pipeline lagrangian mesh interacts with the eulerian mesh during the lagrangian step i e eq 8 of each time increment step therefore the contact between them is similar with the contact of two lagrangian body in traditional fe analysis the soil pipeline interaction is considered with the contact surface approach of coulomb friction which has been widely used in soil structure analysis daiyan et al 2011 roy et al 2015 the friction coefficient of 0 5 is defined between the pipeline and soil sliding occurs if the shear stress on the contact surface exceeds the critical shear stress which is the product of friction coefficient and the contact normal pressure the random field of undrained shear strength which is assumed to be log normally distributed is shown in fig 5 b and mapped onto the regular spatially fixed mesh in fig 5 a to perform a numerical analysis in this study the effects of cov of undrained shear strength s u and the correlation lengths on the probability distribution of the impact force on the pipeline are investigated consider the response of the system i e the runout distance or the impact force on the pipeline is g u the error in estimating the mean response of the system μ g decreases when the number of realizations of the random field increases the number of realizations n that keeps the estimation of the mean response within an error of e r with confidence 1 α is controlled by fenton and griffiths 2008 10 n z α 2 σ g e r 2 where z α 2 is the value of the standard normal variable corresponding to a cumulative probability of 1 α 2 and σ g is the standard deviation of the response g u if the maximum error e r is allowed within 0 1σ g to 0 2σ g with a confidence of 90 the required number of realizations is between 68 and 271 in this study two hundred realizations are performed to ensure stable statistical results and efficient computation performance because different random material properties are adopted in realizations the computation performance is not completely same for every realization computation the mean time consumed is about 25 min per realization computation when the hardware configuration of intel cpu i7 6700 and memory 16g is used fig 6 shows the deformation evolution of the homogeneous soil slope s u 35 kpa where the peeq represents the equivalent plastic strain under the action of both the vertical gravity and the horizontal inertia force the slope slips along a thin shear band located at the lower boundary of the slope fig 6 c describes the ultimate state of interaction between the failed soil and the pipeline that is located on the flow path of the failed slope debris fig 7 shows the variation of impact forces on the pipeline with time the impact force is obtained by integration of all the shear stresses and normal pressures on the interface of the pipeline and soil the red curve represents the evolution of the impact force for the homogeneous slope the horizontal impact force as shown in fig 7 a suddenly increases to a value when the failed soil reaches the pipeline and finally reduces to a stable value with the stop of the soil movement in fig 7 b the vertical impact force for the homogeneous slope gradually increases to a positive value downward direction is positive the red curve in fig 7 c represents the resultant impact force obtained by square sum of the horizontal and vertical impact force the resultant impact force has approximately a similar evolution tendency with the horizontal impact force this indicates the horizontal impact force has a dominated role in the interaction of moving soil and the pipeline the impact force is affected by the spatially random soil property as shown in fig 7 the blue circular marks in fig 7 represent the stochastic analysis results for 200 realizations with cov 0 1 l h 10 m and l v 1 m fig 7 a and c show that both the horizontal and resultant impact forces from a spatially varied soil landslide evolve generally similarly to that in the homogeneous slope however in fig 7 b the vertical impact force from a spatially random soil landslide can be negative i e upward direction to explain this phenomenon fig 8 gives the vertical impact forces that correspond to three typical realizations cov 0 1 l h 10 m and l v 1 m as shown in fig 9 the spatially varied slope determined by realization 1 visibly has a high strength zone at the toe as in fig 9 a and therefore the slope deformation in the whole slipping process is small the failed soil only moves to right beside the pipeline and contributes an upward lift force on the pipeline as shown in fig 8 for realization 2 the soils with larger strength is distributed in areas far away from the slope toe and the strength around the toe is smaller than 35 kpa as shown in fig 9 b therefore a larger deformation is obtained the pipeline is fully buried by a large volume of failed soil which generates a downward vertical impact force positive value in the most slipping time of the slope for realization 3 the spatially varied slope is similar to realization 2 but has a smaller average strength therefore the slope has a larger deformation than that of realization 2 the failed soil that has run over the pipeline moves further forward as shown in fig 9 c this again gives an upward dragging force on the pipeline that can resist the downward force induced by the inertial effect of buried soil volume therefore the vertical impact force corresponding to realization 3 in fig 8 gradually decreases from a positive value to about zero during the later slipping process these results indicate that the vertical impact force is sensitive to the different deformation processes for spatially varied slopes and is easier to behave in a fluctuation form although the vertical impact force is obviously lower than the horizontal impact force its fluctuation feature may damage pipeline with a fatigue failure due to stress concentration fan et al 2018 guo et al 2019 alamilla et al 2013 as the maximum value of the resultant impact force is most useful for the limit state design in engineering practice all the maximum values for the 200 realizations of spatially varied slopes are calculated and the statistical distributions are obtained subsequently the failure probability of the pipeline is quantitatively evaluated based on the statistical maximum impact forces and failure criteria the failure of pipeline depends on many factors such as the pipeline laying method the attack angle of flowing soil mass the environmental stress corrosion guo et al 2019 liu et al 2015 alamilla et al 2013 cunha et al 2009 and etc a proper failure criterion should be chosen based on design purposes and engineering experiences in this study we consider two common failure modes of submarine pipelines i e buckling failure and yield failure the critical value of distributed pressure of a pipeline for elastic buckling is timoshenko and gere 2009 11 p c r 2 e p 1 v p 2 δ d 3 where p cr is the critical value of the uniformly distributed pressure on pipeline e p and v p is the elastic modulus 210 gpa and poisson s ratio of pipeline 0 3 of the pipeline api 5l grade x65 respectively d is the external diameter of pipeline and δ is the wall thickness of the pipeline therefore the limit state function of the buckling failure is defined as 12 f 1 q a p c r where q is the uniformly distributed impact force per unit length along the axial direction of the pipeline and a is the projected area along the direction of landslide impact when f 1 0 no buckling of pipeline occurs otherwise the pipeline fails with buckling for the plastic yield failure mode we assume the pipeline is laid perpendicularly relative to the impact direction of the landslide the impact force uniformly distributes along the pipeline axial direction given that the landslide size in the pipeline axial direction is large enough as in fig 10 a the submarine pipelines generally need protection technologies such as ripraps sandbag filling concrete cover and short pile support chiew 1992 guo et al 2019 a multi spanned continuous beam model may be more realistic for the submarine pipeline however the number of influenced spans relies on how large the landslides area is and therefore the present rcel method should be extended to a 3d application in this study we only consider the problem as a plane strain condition and assume the pipeline supported by concrete covers as a simply supported beam fig 10 b according to the previous studies dermendjianivanova 1992 peng et al 2018 the critical bending moment of a simply supported beam is higher than that of a multi spanned continuous beam model so that a conservative result of risk assessment would be obtained constraints on both sides represent concrete covers and the distance between two nearest covers is l the mid section of the pipeline bears a maximum bending moment and the maximum tensile stress lies on the outermost side of pipeline circle section the maximum bending moment m is calculated as 13 m q l 2 8 where l is the distance between two nearest covers the maximum tensile stress σ t can be obtained by 14 σ t m w w π d 3 32 1 d 2 δ d 4 where w is the section modulus of bending hence the limit state function for the yield failure can be defined as 15 f 2 σ t σ y where σ y is the yield stress of the material of pipeline and it varies between about 200 mpa and 500 mpa for different grades of steel o rourke and liu 2011 here we assume the yield stress σ y 450 mpa for the pipeline steel api 5l grade x65 when f 2 0 the pipeline is safe with no yielding otherwise the pipeline yields the impact force per unit length q in eqs 11 and 13 corresponding to each sample of the stochastic analysis is obtained then the obtained maximum impact forces are substituted into eq 12 and eq 15 to evaluate the failure probability of the pipeline for the failure modes of buckling failure and yield failure the pipeline failure probability p f is obtained by computing the total percentage of f 1 0 or f 2 0 16 p f n f i 0 n t i 1 2 where n f i 0 represents the number of failures in total of n t samples note that only impact force of the landslide is considered when computing the p f in reality the gravity of pipeline and the passive earth pressure induced by soil pipeline interaction would also influence the probability of failure in this study the gravity of the pipeline is neglected because it is around two order magnitude smaller than the landslide impact the passive earth pressure may dismiss because the soil supporting the pipeline may be washed away by vortex induced vibration zhang et al 2016 hence the passive earth pressure can be omitted to get a conservative result 4 1 effect of cov of shear strength on landslide impact of pipeline research studies of characterization of spatial variability for marine soils are relatively limited tang 1979 yoon et al 2004 yi et al 2019 liu et al 2017 researchers phoon and kulhawy 1999 found that there is no significant difference in spatial variability between land and shallow marine sediments according to the research by phoon and kulhawy 1999 the average vertical correlation length of the undrained shear strength is about 2 5 m and the average horizontal correlation length is more than one order magnitude larger than the vertical i e about 50 7 m in the horizontal direction the cov of s u generally lies between 0 1 and 0 3 to study the effect of cov of s u on the landslide behaviors the cov of s u varies from 0 1 to 0 3 with constant values of l h 10 m and l v 1m fig 11 a c illustrate the evolution of resultant impact force for different covs of s u the 90 uncertainty bounds marked by dotted lines and the mean values are also plotted with solid black lines it shows that the mean value is greater than the deterministic value corresponding to the homogeneous slope at an early time of landslide impact which indicates that the spatially varied slope is easier to reach the failure state and has an earlier collision with the pipeline during the later interaction process the mean value approximately agrees with the deterministic value however with the increasing of cov of s u from 0 1 to 0 3 the final stable value of the mean impact force has a tendency to be smaller than the final stable deterministic value of the impact force the reason is that the number of realizations of spatially varied slope with extremely large or low strength will obviously rise when the cov of s u varies from 0 1 to 0 3 for example the upper uncertainty bound has an increasing tendency and the lower uncertainty bound obviously approaches zero as shown from fig 11 especially in fig 11 c the zero impact force accounts for at least 5 of the total 200 realizations this indicates the occurring frequency of two extreme deformation results increases i e the small scale of deformation and the large scale of deformation the former leads to nearly no soil collision with the pipeline and the probability of impact forces approaching zero will rise while the latter leads to further runout distance and the final thickness of debris that buries on the pipeline will be thinner due to mass conservation though the failed soil may generate a very large impact force during the early sliding stage for this case the final stable impact force would show a considerably smaller value the corresponding distributions of maximum impact force are plotted on fig 11 d f with cov of s u increasing from 0 1 to 0 3 the result shows that the standard deviation of maximum impact force increases with the cov of s u by dividing the standard deviation by the mean value the cov of the maximum impact force can be obtained as 0 28 0 42 and 0 49 respectively this shows the uncertainty of the maximum impact force is significantly enlarged when the cov of s u increases fig 11 d shows the distribution of the maximum impact force is similar to the gaussian distribution when the uncertainty of the field is small cov 0 1 however the distribution shapes are not gaussian types when the cov of undrained shear strength increases to 0 2 and 0 3 in fig 11 f the distribution has two peaks that might be related to different failure modes of the landslides fig 12 presents some examples of different failure modes for spatially varied slopes the failure modes can be classified into three types local failure with a shallow slip surface global failure with a deep seated slip surface and bedding failure with the deformation restricted by the bedrock these complex failure modes will generate different collision effects on the pipeline and they are the main factors to cause multiple peaks distribution when cov of s u is large in addition we notice from fig 12 that more slumping behavior of the soil is observed and the soil separation along the shear band is not obvious enough when comparing with the deformation result in dey et al 2015 in which the cel method was also used the major reason of more slumping behavior in this study lies on the adopted constitutive model where no strain softening effect is considered previous studies based on the cel large deformation analysis demonstrated that other influencing factors in addition to the softening behavior of marine soils would contribute the failure modes of landslides for example dey et al 2015 simulated the deformation process of a slope with a sensitive clay underlying a stronger crust they used a softening undrained shear strength i e softening tresca yield criterion in the sensitive clay but no softening as in this study i e tresca yield criterion in the crust layer the simulations showed that only the cases with a certain thickness of the crust can cause a retrogressive failure mode even when the softening of the clay layer is considered for the case with a very thin crust less than 1 m only the global failure with one shear band was observed the sensitivity and the slope angle are also important for the failure modes however with considering of softening behavior actually more obvious soil separation along the shear band was observed in dey et al 2015 therefore the constitution model and the soil profiles assumed in the example problem of this study may suppress the separation along the shear band relatively it should be mentioned that comparing with the continuous mechanics based numerical methods such as the cel method in this study the particle based methods such as sph dem and mpm are better to simulate the soil separation because of their inherent advantages to deal with the non continuum deformation wang et al 2018 2019 guo and zhao 2014 another reason for the slumping behavior may be the horizontal seismic load applied on the slope in this study in dey et al 2015 only static gravity loads were considered however the horizontal seismic load applied on the slope can cause a more obvious slumping of the whole soil mass 4 2 effect of correlation lengths on the soil pipeline interaction to study the effect of correlation lengths on the landslide behaviors the horizontal and vertical correlation lengths are changed in the spatially varied slope considering constant vertical correlation length as 2 m and cov of s u as 0 1 the horizontal correlation length l h decreases from 60 m to 20 m and the distribution of maximum impact force on pipeline is plotted on fig 13 for spatially varied slopes the mean value the standard deviation and the cov of the maximum impact force are shown in fig 14 a c the mean value generally remains constant when l h varies but is larger than the deterministic value the standard deviation does not vary much when l h decreases from 60 m to 20 m but decreases significantly when l h reduces to less than 20 m the cov of the maximum impact force as in fig 14 c also shows a decreasing tendency similar to the standard deviation when l h decreases when l v varies from 1 m to 10 m l h 10 m and cov of s u 0 1 the calculated results of the statistical values as shown in fig 14 e and f the results reveal that variation of the vertical correlation length has little influence on the mean value the standard deviation and the cov of the maximum impact force these above results indicate the uncertainty of the maximum impact force is significantly reduced when l h decreases but shows no significant change when l v varies the failure feature of the slope can explain this observation as shown in fig 12 the slope mainly slips along a thin and long shear band in the horizontal direction when failure occurs therefore the variation of the horizontal correlation length can significantly affect the spatial distribution of the undrained shear strength along the shear band for example in fig 15 a two realizations of slopes with cov 0 1 l h 40 m l v 2 m is presented these realizations show horizontally layers which have similar shear strengths in the entire horizontal direction it can lead to either too large or too small shear strength in the major part of the landslide which can increase the uncertainty of slope deformation and runout distance and in turn increase the uncertainty of the maximum impact force when the horizontal correlation length decreases to the value of 2 m as shown in fig 15 b the random field generates scatter varied strength values in the entire horizontal direction the spatial average effect of undrained shear strength in horizontal direction would be more prominent therefore the uncertainty of the maximum impact force can be significantly reduced due to spatial average effect on the other hand the variation of the vertical correlation length is not easy to change the probability distribution of the undrained shear strength in a thin shear band therefore the uncertainty of the maximum impact force varies little when the vertical correlation length changes 4 3 comparison of stochastic and deterministic analyses all the results in figs 12 and 13 show that the mean values of the maximum impact force from spatially varied landslides are larger than the deterministic value of a homogeneous slope the proportions of the maximum impact force that exceeds the deterministic value are listed in table 1 the proportion is generally between 52 and 67 which is a considerable large probability the result indicates the potential impact force may be significantly underestimated in a deterministic analysis 4 4 evaluation of pipeline failure based on two failure criteria as mentioned above two failure criteria i e buckling failure criterion and yield failure criterion are adopted to evaluate the pipeline failure probability based on the distribution of maximum impact force fig 16 shows variations of pipeline failure probability with the wall thickness when considering buckling failure for different spatially varied slopes the failure probability has a similar trend that decreases with the wall thickness δ if the acceptable failure probability of buckling is 0 005 corresponding to a target reliability index of 2 6 the wall thickness δ should be greater than 10 5 mm however δ is only 8 6 mm for a homogeneous slope the failure probability corresponding to δ 8 6 mm is about 0 6 as shown in fig 16 this result reveals that pipeline design with a deterministic analysis would suffer a 60 probability of buckling failure and this demonstrates the importance of considering spatial variability as demonstrated in sections 4 1 and 4 2 the increases of the cov and horizontal correlation length of s u will enlarge the uncertainty of the maximum impact force the number of extreme values of the impact force would increase when the cov or the horizontal correlation length of s u increase consequently as shown in fig 16 for weak pipelines with small values of δ the probability of failure is greater than 0 5 the failure probability decreases with the increase of cov of s u or l h because fewer realizations reach the threshold of buckling failure the failure probability however increases for strong pipelines with large values of δ because the probability of failure is less than 0 5 and more realizations can exceed the failure threshold as the cov of s u or l h increases fig 17 shows envelopes of failure probability corresponding to plastic yield failure the graph is for the case with cov of s u 0 1 l h 60 m and l v 2 m envelopes corresponding to other cases are similar to fig 17 consider p f 0 005 as the acceptable failure probability the combinations of l and δ located below the solid black line is acceptable to avoid the plastic yielding failure the dash lines represent situations with different failure probabilities the envelope obtained by the deterministic analysis is slightly below the line with p f 0 6 it reveals deterministic pipeline design would suffer a yielding failure probability of around 60 the yielding failure envelopes are influenced by the characteristics values of spatial variability as shown in fig 18 however for a pipeline with a given thickness and a design failure probability p f 0 005 the alteration in design envelopes due to different spatial varied fields is not significant different spatial varied fields give an almost consistent critical failure envelope for pipeline design in the stochastic analysis the buckling failure criterion determines a safe region of wall thickness i e δ 10 5 mm and the yielding failure criterion determines another safe region below the envelope marked by p f 0 005 therefore the safety design of pipeline should locate within the intersection of these two safe regions as shown in fig 19 the graph also shows the safety region obtained by deterministic analysis the result demonstrates that the deterministic analysis will lead to an unsafe design of the submarine pipeline and more risk may be induced if spatial variability is not considered 5 concluding remarks a random coupled eulerian lagrangian method rcel for stochastic analysis of large deformation behaviors of the landslide is proposed in this study the entire failure process of landslides and the subsequent impact on pipelines are investigated the major findings are summarized as follows 1 under the action of the vertical gravity and horizontal inertia force the failure modes in spatially varied slopes become complex with the increased values of cov 0 1 0 3 of undrained shear strength the local failure with a shallow slip surface the global failure with a deeply seated slip surface and the bedding failure with the deformation restricted by the bedrock can be found in spatially varied slopes with a larger cov 2 the uncertainty of the maximum impact force increases with the cov of the undrained shear strength while the mean value only changes slightly the uncertainty of the maximum impact force generally decreases with the reduction of horizontal correlation length due to spatial averaging effect along the horizontal slip surface this reduction of uncertainty is most significant when l h is smaller than 20 m however the vertical correlation length does not affect the uncertainty of the maximum impact force 3 the mean impact forces are larger than that of the homogenous slope the proportion of the maximum impact force that exceeds the deterministic value is between 52 and 67 this result implies that a deterministic analysis would significantly underestimate the potential impact risk induced by slope failure even if the deterministic analysis adopted large deformation simulation 4 for an acceptable failure probability of 0 005 the wall thickness should be greater than 10 5 mm for the buckling failure the yielding failure criterion determines combinations of l and δ within a certain safe region a deterministic design would suffer around 60 probability of failure if spatial variability is not considered this study provides a unified numerical method that can comprehensively assess the landslide uncertainty and the subsequent impact risk on pipelines one of the limitations of the present work is that a linear elastic perfectly plastic soil model is used in this study the shear strength of soft clay can be influenced by complicated inherent characteristics such as large strain rate rocchi et al 2003 dong et al 2017 and sensitivity yafrate et al 2009 lunne et al 2010 another limitation is that the proposed method cannot consider the effect of waves and flows on the soil and pipelines the coupling of soil and water or mixture of soil with seawater may affect the deformation of the submarine landslide liu et al 2015 in future study advanced constitutive models and numerical simulations considering the above complex characteristics and behaviors of marine clays should be used to reproduce a more reasonable soil deformation process credit authorship contribution statement x y chen conceptualization methodology data curation writing original draft visualization software formal analysis

21484,despite the high capacity of wind energy in the offshore regions of iran seas wind power plants in these parts have not been significantly considered in this study the temporal and spatial wind characteristics and wind energy potential of the persian gulf are investigated during the years 2000 2017 based on the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era5 reanalysis data set the spatio temporal distributions of the annual seasonal monthly and diurnal mean wind characteristics are presented using the 18 year hourly resolution results statistical analysis and variability indices of the wind parameters are presented the weibull density function is used to assess and analyze the wind characteristics of the region the weibull shape k and scale c parameters are calculated using the maximum likelihood estimation mle method finally the wind capacities at the 12 potential locations near the populated or industrial regions around the studied area are derived besides the capacity factor and the potential energy output of two commercial wind turbines are investigated which are appropriate for the locations at 50 m and 80 m hub heights the present results can be used to develop of wind energy plans and wind energy potential assessment in the studied area keywords persian gulf wind power density wind speed spatial and temporal analysis weibull distribution 1 introduction the exploitation of renewable energy sources in the world has increased over the past decades due to the fossil fuel risks such as climate changes and severe air pollution in metropolitan areas gielen et al 2019 harjanne and korhonen 2019 wind energy has attracted considerable attention in recent years wind energy has many advantages such as sustainable available in large quantities and predictable behavior to design new concepts of wind energy technologies offshore wind energy has several advantages in comparison with onshore wind energy esteban et al 2011 shu et al 2015 first of all wind speed over the oceans is generally higher than those at nearby coastal locations faster offshore wind speed means much more energy can be harvested secondly the wind shear and turbulence are lower at offshore sites which allow the use of shorter offshore towers and reduce the fatigue loads on the wind turbines respectively thirdly offshore wind is more stable which means a more reliable source of energy finally the provision of coastal areas energy demands and the availability of sufficient space to build offshore wind farms are other benefits of offshore wind energy therefore regions located near the coastal areas have good potential to benefit from wind energy in comparison with other locations iran as a developing country is mostly dependent on fossil fuels although iran still relies heavily on fossil fuels the demand for energy is rapidly increasing and on the other hand some factors such as air pollution environmental problems and climate changes affecting the use of fossil fuels khojasteh et al 2018 mahmoodi et al 2019 the development of new energy technologies may assist in overcoming fossil fuel problems iran has a very long coastline which is surrounded by three vast seas in the north the caspian sea and south the persian gulf and the gulf of oman therefore wind energy especially in offshore areas is an untapped resource able to make a significant contribution to renewable energy generation in iran so far some studies have been carried out to examine the wind characteristics in iran and offshore and onshore areas of this country in the keyhani et al 2010 study the 3 h period measured long term wind speed data of the capital of iran tehran were statistically analyzed the probability density distributions were derived and the distribution parameters were identified the essential characteristics of wind energy at four zones in two provinces of iran north and south khorasan have been studied at the height of 10 m 30 m and 40 m saeidi et al 2011 the wind power potential and technical and economic feasibility of wind turbine installation in the shahrbabak city in kerman province are presented in mostafaeipour et al 2011 in the study alamdari et al 2012 10 min measuring wind speed data for the year 2007 at 10 m 30 m and 40 m heights for different places in iran has been statistically analyzed to determine the potential of wind power generation the hourly measured wind speed data for years 2007 2010 at 10 m 30 m and 40 m height for the binalood region in iran have been statically investigated mostafaeipour et al 2013 in rusu and onea 2013 based on both remotely sensed measurements and results provided by numerical models the wind and wave conditions of the caspian sea have been evaluated in mostafaeipour et al 2014 research five year 2003 2007 wind data has been analyzed to obtain wind power density and the wind energy potential in zahedan in amirinia et al 2017 research the uncertainties in determining the offshore wind and wave energies have been considered to estimate the wind and wave energy potentials in the southern caspian sea the wind and wave spatio temporal variability in the persian gulf using localized ecmwf wind data is investigated in kamranzad 2018 since wind energy is directly related to wind speed the accurate estimation of wind speed is crucial for all aspects of wind energy assessment to obtain useful knowledge about wind energy in a specific site it is necessary to analyze the wind speed frequency distribution wind power potential and plan econometrics of the selected site can be assessed using the data distribution the prediction of wind speed is carried out using the probability distribution functions wang et al 2016 there are several probability density functions such as weibull rayleigh gamma beta gaussian and log normal distribution which can be applied to demonstrate the wind speed frequency over a period of time aries et al 2018 mazzeo et al 2018 in particular the weibull probability distribution has been frequently applied in the literature katinas et al 2018 li et al 2018a özel et al 2015 shu et al 2015 due to its simplicity and providing adequate representation of the variation of wind speed over a period of time for this reason in the present study the weibull function is applied to fit the probability distribution of wind speed data in the studied area although the persian gulf has good potential in terms of wind energy in the offshore areas this source of energy is not taken into account significantly yet due to reasons such as the lack of quality data in these regions few studies have been specifically focused on the wind energy assessment in the persian gulf so far therefore a detailed wind energy assessment is required to determine energy opportunities across the offshore and onshore areas the main aim of this study is to investigate the spatio temporal wind fields and its associated energy for the persian gulf from 2000 to 2017 based on the ecmwf era5 reanalysis data set c3s 2017 the methodology presented in this paper concentrates on providing a better understanding of the long term temporal and spatial characteristics of the wind climate in this region to overcome limitations of studies mentioned above using a much higher spatial and temporal resolution era5 data set this is accomplished by determining the mean wind energy potential and its annual seasonal monthly and diurnal variations investigating the directional properties of wind and calculating the temporal variability indices of different time scales besides 12 locations are selected near the important areas or cities around the persian gulf to evaluate the site specific wind energy for the selected sites in terms of wind speed and wind direction moreover the weibull distribution function is applied to fit and describe the wind speed frequency over time due to its simplicity and high level of accuracy on the other hand the obtained results are applied to evaluate the wind power density at hub height and assess the potential of the studied area for installing the commercial wind turbines to generate electricity most probable wind speed and wind speed carrying maximum energy operating probability of both selected wind turbine prototypes and their capacity factor are also calculated for the 12 selected locations the procedure and methods presented in this study can be used as a reference or guideline to assess the wind energy potential in the rest of the world the rest of this paper is structured as follows in section 2 the study area and the corresponding data source are introduced the details of the weibull distribution function are presented in section 3 the methodologies used to characterize the wind energy resources and the temporal variability indices are described in sections 4 and 5 respectively in section 6 the main results including the spatio temporal distribution of wind power density of the studied area and their annual seasonal monthly and diurnal variations wind energy assessment in the overall area and selected locations and statistical analysis of the wind parameters are proposed finally some concluding remarks are presented in section 7 2 study area and data sources the considered area in this study is the persian gulf located in the south part of iran and adjacent to the arabian peninsula it is surrounded by iran iraq kuwait bahrain saudi arabia qatar and the united arab emirates fig 1 shows the geographic locations of the studied area in this study based on the 10 m neutral wind speed and 10 m neutral wind direction data provided by the era5 reanalysis data set from the ecmwf the spatio temporal characteristics of wind fields in the persian gulf from 2000 to 2017 with 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution and hourly temporal resolution are analyzed the neutral wind which is in the direction of the surface stress obtains from the roughness length and surface stress by assuming that the air is neutrally stratified c3s 2017 in stable conditions the neutral wind is slower than the actual wind while in the unstable conditions it is faster to download the data set and get further details about the studied wind parameters can be seen the website http climate copernicus eu climate reanalysis 3 weibull distribution function the weibull probability distribution function of wind speed f v is depicted as shu et al 2015 1 f v k c v c k 1 e v c k v 0 k 0 c 0 where k is the shape parameter dimensionless and c is scale parameter m s the parameter k determines the width of the data distribution plot which reflects how the wind distribution is peaking and parameter c indicates how windy a location is several methods such as optimization algorithms and numerical methods have been used to estimate the weibull parameters in the previous studies wang et al 2018 some of these methods are the moment method standard deviation method energy pattern factor method mle method cuckoo search algorithm particle swarm optimization algorithm and grey wolf optimizer algorithm in this study the mle method is employed the parameters k and c are obtained according to the following equations wang et al 2018 2 k i 1 n v i k l n v i i 1 n v i k 1 n i 1 n l n v i 1 3 c 1 n i 1 n v i k 1 k where v i is the wind speed and n is the number of measurements when parameters of weibull distribution functions k r and c r at a reference height h r are known then k z and c z for altitude h z above anemometer level are obtained using the following equations katinas et al 2018 4 k z k r 1 0 0881 l n h r 10 1 0 0881 l n h z 10 5 c z c r h z h r n here reference height h r is considered as 10 m and the value of the power law index n is adopted as 0 11 according to hsu et al 1994 shu et al 2015 generally the n value depends on the surface roughness and atmospheric stability katinas et al 2018 4 wind energy indicators 4 1 wind power and wind energy densities wind power density estimation is necessary to evaluate how much energy is available at a specific site the wind power density is dependent on the wind speed and air density the wind power per unit area or the wind power density can be calculated by li et al 2018b 6 p 1 2 ρ v 3 where p is the wind power per unit area in w m 2 the air density ρ is often adopted as 1 225 kg m3 at temperature 15 c the estimated weibull parameters can be directly utilized to assess wind power density based on the weibull probability density function wind power density can be calculated using the following equation 7 p 1 2 ρ c 3 γ 1 3 k where γ is the gamma function which has a standard form of 8 γ x 0 t x 1 e t d t the wind energy density for a specific period t in hours is defined as follows 9 e p t where p can be calculated using eqs 6 and 7 4 2 most probable wind speed and wind speed carrying maximum energy the peak of a given probability distribution function shows the most probable value of studied wind speed data set v m p the v m p in terms of shape and scale factors of the weibull distribution can be expressed as shu et al 2015 10 v m p c 1 1 k 1 k the wind speed carrying maximum energy v m a x e is defined as follows 11 v m a x e c 1 2 k 1 k 4 3 wind speed at the hub height in terms of the weibull distribution function the mean wind speed v can be obtained as follows katinas et al 2018 12 v c γ 1 1 k wind speed values should be extrapolated to the hub height of turbines in wind power applications the wind speed change with altitude can be calculated by using wind shear power law as liu et al 2019 13 v z v r h z h r n where v z is the wind speed at the height h z v r is the wind speed at the reference height h r which is considered at 10 m above ground level and n 0 11 is selected 4 4 operating probability of wind turbines the cut in and cut out wind speeds are two essential parameters for the operation of wind turbines the cut in speed denotes the minimum wind speed at which the turbine blades overcome friction and begin to rotate to generate useable power whereas the cut out wind speed represents the speed at which the turbine blades are brought to rest to avoid damage from extreme winds for most available wind turbines the cut in speed is in the range of 3 5 m s while the cut out speed can be as high as 25 m s shu et al 2015 the operating probability of wind turbines can be evaluated by the cumulative weibull distribution function 14 p v cut in v v cut out e v cut in c k e v cut out c k where v cut in and v cut out denote and cut in and cut out wind speed respectively 4 5 wind turbine capacity factor the capacity factor c f is defined as the ratio of the average power output in a certain period to the rated electrical power i e running full time at rated power li et al 2018a it is possible to calculate wind turbine c f based on the weibull distribution function as follows liu et al 2019 15 c f e v cut in c k e v rated c k v rated c k v cut in c k e v cut out c k where v rated is the rated wind speed 5 temporal variability indices the temporal variability is necessary to specify the regions that the wind field is stable and energy production has a slight change more stable locations are usually better to develop wind farm plans in this paper four coefficients gonçalves et al 2018 including the coefficient of variation c o v the seasonal variability index s v the monthly variability index m v and the annual variability a v are used to evaluate the temporal variability of wind speed and wind energy c o v is obtained by dividing the standard deviation σ by the mean μ of a series which is expressed as follows 16 c o v σ μ p p 2 p where the overbar denotes the mean and p is the parameter that we want to calculate its temporal variability the a v is expressed as 17 a v p a 1 p a 2 p y e a r where p a 1 and p a 2 are the mean p of the most and the least energetic year respectively p y e a r is the yearly mean here calculated over the 18 years the s v can be defined as 18 s v p s 1 p s 2 p y e a r where p s 1 and p s 2 are the mean p of the most and the least energetic season respectively the m v is defined as follows 19 m v p m 1 p m 2 p y e a r where p m 1 and p m 2 are the mean p of the most and the least energetic month respectively 6 results and discussions in this section the spatio temporal characteristics of wind are analyzed in the overall persian gulf for the period of 18 year 2000 2017 in terms of annual seasonal monthly and diurnal variations the spatial resolution of the used data set is 0 5 0 5 a three layer input hidden output feed forward neural network ffnn khosravi et al 2018 mahmoodi et al 2017 marugán et al 2018 navas et al 2019 vaghefi et al 2018 with 10 hidden neurons is used to fit studied parameters between main data points levenberg marquardt back propagation with tangent sigmoid activation function for the hidden layer is used as the training algorithm which is implemented in matlab software the latitude and longitude of era5 model points are considered as network input while the studied wind parameter is considered as network output to validate the created ffnn models two criteria including the correlation coefficient r and mean error bias are calculated according to eq 20 and eq 21 respectively 20 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 21 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 where x i and y i are observed and predicted values respectively and x and y are their average values respectively of n total samples the performance parameters r and r m s e are calculated for each created ffnn model 18 year annual seasonal monthly and diurnal wind speed and wind direction and the best model is chosen based on their value the best obtained model has the least r m s e and the maximum r 2 as a sample the regression plot and error histogram of the created ffnn models for the 18 year annual mean 10 m wind speed and wind direction are shown in fig 2 as observed in this figure it can be said that the ffnn models give an acceptable approximation of the annual mean of wind speed and wind direction in general the ffnn method is relatively provided better results for the wind speed and wind direction of unknown latitudes and longitudes of the studied area 6 1 annual wind power density distribution the 18 year annual mean spatial distribution of 10 m wind speed and wind power density based on eq 6 is shown in fig 3 according to this figure wind speed is varied from 4 to 6 m s with 60 120 w m2 wind power density in most parts of the persian gulf the highest wind speed greater than 5 5 m s and the highest wind power density greater than 100 w m2 occur especially in the central parts of the persian gulf the wind power density along the onshore is relatively lower than the offshore due to land effects moreover unlike the northern parts of the persian gulf most of the southern parts have higher wind speed values hence higher mean wind power density is expected from the southern parts the annual variation of wind speed and wind power density is summarized using the box plot in fig 4 moreover in this figure right side the concepts of the box plot are presented base on fig 4 it is found that the trend of wind speed in different years is negligible the overall annual mean wind speed is 4 70 m s and the highest annual mean wind speed appears in the year 2000 6 10 m s followed by year 2011 6 06 m s year 2004 5 95 m s and year 2013 5 89 m s while the lowest belongs to the year 2010 5 16 m s followed by the year 2017 5 45 m s interquartile range iqr is the difference between the first and third quartiles in the box plot diagram the year 2011 exhibits the highest iqr 1 21 m s which denotes the high variability of wind speed among all years while the lowest belongs to the year 2017 iqr 0 92 m s these results are also valid for wind power density to assess the directional distribution of the 18 year annual mean wind speed in the persian gulf the rose plot of the mean wind data is shown in fig 5 based on this figure it can be said that the northwest direction plays an important role in most directions of the persian gulf the predominant direction is due to the shamal wind which blows from north and northwest over the persian gulf and often is active during the day and decreases at night liao and kaihatu 2016 6 2 seasonal wind power density distribution the 18 year seasonal mean spatial distribution of wind speed and wind power density is shown in fig 6 according to fig 6 a the mean wind speed is higher during winter comparing to the other seasons this is due to the general atmospheric circulation at this period of the year the lowest wind speeds occurred in the summer it should be noted that the difference between the fall and the summer is negligible the mean wind speed increases in the summer fall spring and becomes more energetic in the winter in winter the highest mean wind speed is about 6 5 m s which occurs in the central part of the persian gulf around 50 52 5 e longitudes and 25 5 27 5 n latitudes while it is about 5 m s during fall and summer in the northwestern parts of the area moreover in spring the higher wind speed of more than 6 m s appears in the central part of the area researches in kamranzad 2018 thoppil and hogan 2010 reported the mean wind speed values of 5 m s and 5 9 m s for the winter in the persian gulf fig 6 b shows the mean seasonal spatial distribution of wind power density generally the locations of the highest wind power density are similar to the highest wind speeds the highest wind power density is about 220 w m2 and occurs in the winter while the lowest occurs in summer in all seasons the wind power density between 50 and 100 w m2 occurs in most of the persian gulf the box plot of the 18 year seasonal mean wind speed and wind power density is presented in fig 7 based on this figure the highest and the lowest variations of the wind speed and wind power density are occurred in winter and fall due to higher iqr respect to other seasons the larger iqr means more variability in the data the box plot of summer is comparatively shorter than other seasons which suggests that overall data have a high level of agreement with each other the directional distribution of the 18 year seasonal mean wind speed is plotted as wind roses in fig 8 as shown in this figure the wind distribution pattern varies in different seasons but similarly the prevailing wind direction is northwest in all seasons 6 3 monthly wind power density distribution fig 9 presents the spatial distribution of the 18 year monthly mean of the wind speed and wind power density according to fig 9 a the highest mean wind speed occurs in january february and december in the central part of the area during winter time shamal while the lowest occurs in august and september which is due to the predominant shamal wind which blows in winter and summer from the north or northwest over the persian gulf fig 10 b shows the monthly mean spatial distribution of the 18 year of wind power density generally it can be seen that the distribution of wind power density is similar to the wind speed the highest wind power density 220 w m2 arises in january february and december while the lowest occurs in august and september the box plot of the 18 year monthly mean of wind speed and wind power density of the overall studied area is presented in fig 10 the monthly mean of wind speed and wind power density are increased in december january and february and decreased during march and april subsequently these parameters are increased in may and june and then reduced until they reach their lowest level in august afterward wind speed and wind power density are raised again in september october and november to demonstrate the distribution of the wind speed and its direction the 18 year monthly mean wind rose of the overall studied area is presented in fig 11 as observed from this figure the prevailing wind direction is northwest in most months 6 4 diurnal wind power density distribution the 18 year diurnal mean wind speed and wind power density of the whole studied area are illustrated in fig 12 extreme values beyond the whiskers are displayed using mark according to fig 12 a it can be observed that the variations in the diurnal mean wind speeds are relatively small and the day time wind speed is higher in comparison to the night time the mean wind speed increases from 0 a m till noon which reaches the highest values and later slightly decreases it should be noted that to improve the display of box plots all data are not shown in fig 12 based on fig 12 b likewise the diurnal variation of the wind power density follows that of the mean wind speed at each hour of the day the variation of the wind power density is also small within 24 h the highest wind power densities are generally found during 11 12 a m and 1 2 pm 6 5 temporal variability the temporal variability distribution of the wind speed and wind power density is presented in figs 13 and 14 based on these figures it can be found that the onshore regions have the lowest temporal variability indices and the temporal variability increases towards the central parts of the persian gulf although the central areas of the persian gulf are energetic their stability is lower than in the onshore areas generally west and northwestern parts of the studied area experience higher variability rather than east strait of hormuz and southeastern based on figs 13 and 14 the m v is larger than the s v and the s v is larger than the a v wind speed highest values of a v s v and m v are in the range of 0 14 0 19 0 3 0 39 and 0 45 0 61 respectively moreover the wind power density highest values of a v s v and m v are in the range of 0 40 0 55 0 90 1 23 and 1 20 1 65 respectively therefore it can be said that wind power density has a higher variability with respect to wind speed consequently it can be generally concluded that wind speed and wind energy in the persian gulf have good stability 6 6 wind power density characteristics in the selected locations in order to study the characteristics of wind power density in different regions 12 locations are selected near the important areas or cities around the persian gulf table 1 the onshore points p1 to p5 northern coasts and p8 to p12 southern coasts are representing the coastal part of the populated or industrial regions around the studied area locations p6 and p7 are selected randomly in the near central parts of the persian gulf fig 15 presents the box plot of the 18 year annual mean wind power density at selected locations p1 to p12 according to this figure the 18 year annual wind power density for all locations except p6 is mostly less than 100 w m2 while p6 gives relatively more considerable wind power density the central points p6 and p7 have a higher amount of power respect to onshore areas with the annual mean power range up to 113 w m2 among the locations of the northern coasts of the studied area p1 to p5 the locations p2 has the highest mean wind power density the annual mean wind power density at the southern location p8 to p12 ranges between 10 and 98 7 w m2 where the highest annual mean wind power density corresponds to p6 about 98 7 w m2 while the lowest correspond to p12 approximately 10 86 w m2 to achieve more details about wind power density status table 2 presents the 18 year annual seasonal and monthly mean of the wind power density during 2000 2017 at selected locations p1 to p12 moreover the variability indices of these locations are depicted in table 3 as seen in table 2 the response of the wind power density is different according to the locations the location p12 has the lowest wind power density among all locations while p6 has the highest wind power density in many locations relatively large wind power density can be found in winter while the lowest occurred in the fall the highest mean wind power density in winter spring summer and fall is at locations p6 p6 p8 and p9 respectively this is due to the winter and summer time shamal winds affect the center and northwestern of the persian gulf respectively generally the mean wind power density during all seasons is more robust in the southern location respect to northern based on table 2 the highest mean wind power density exists in january february and december for most locations while the lowest belongs to august p6 has the highest mean wind power density from january to june also the highest mean wind power density during july august november and december belongs to p6 locations p8 and p9 have the highest mean wind power density from july to september and october respectively the wind power density at p12 is considerably low in all the months with the maximum in march 14 19 w m2 according to table 3 the location p6 experiences higher variation mean wind power density with respect to other locations while location p4 is more stable than other locations another essential parameter to wind energy resource assessment and site selection is the occurrence percentage of wind speed table 4 presents the 18 year occurrence percentage of the wind speed at selected locations p1 to p12 according to this table it can be observed that wind speed in the study area is mostly between 2 and 4 m s followed by 4 6 m s for all locations in addition to wind speed wind direction is also an important parameter in energy assessment the 18 year annual mean wind power density roses corresponding to 12 selected points are presented in fig 16 which provide useful information on the distribution of wind direction and availability of directional wind speed as seen from this figure the northwest is the dominant direction in most of the locations except p4 p5 and p12 the dominant direction of locations p4 and p12 is north and the dominant direction of p5 is northeast directions from the northwest to the southeast are the most common wind directions due to the predominant shamal wind 6 6 1 most probable wind speed and wind speed carrying maximum energy for the following analysis the shape k and scale c parameters of the annual seasonal and monthly wind speed are calculated using eqs 2 and 3 respectively as a sample fig 17 presents the weibull distribution function to the 18 year annual mean wind speed at each location the obtained weibull parameters can be used to calculate the most probable wind speed v m p and the wind speed carrying maximum energy v m a x e based on eqs 10 and 11 v m p denotes the most frequent wind speed of a given wind probability distribution while v m a x e is the wind speed that produces most of the energy the temporal variation of v m p and v m a x e at selected locations p1 to p12 are illustrated in table 5 as this table indicates the values of v m p and v m a x e are altered from the different locations during the different time periods but they do not have an obvious discrepancy in 18 year time period the highest and the lowest v m p belong to p9 and p12 respectively the highest and the lowest v m a x e belong to p6 and p12 respectively the highest values of v m p and v m a x e in most locations are visible in winter and they have the lowest values in summer moreover the highest seasonal mean of v m p and v m a x e correspond to p9 and p6 respectively locations p9 p6 p8 and p9 have the highest values of v m p in winter spring summer and fall respectively while the lowest value of v m p belongs to p12 in all seasons 6 6 2 wind speed at the hub height usually wind turbines have hub heights higher than 10 m therefore the mean extrapolated wind speed derived with theoretical methods using eqs 12 and 13 for the 12 selected locations at 10 50 and 80 m hub height are shown in table 6 in this table v 10 v 50 and v 80 are the mean wind speed at 10 50 and 80 m respectively as seen from table 6 the wind speed is lower at lower altitudes and is increased at higher altitudes moreover the wind speed at the offshore locations is typically higher than onshore locations 6 6 3 wind power and wind energy densities at the hub height as the weibull parameters are determined the corresponding wind power density and wind energy densities can be calculated by eqs 7 and 9 respectively tables 7 and 8 present the temporal variation of mean wind power and mean wind energy densities of selected locations p1 to p12 at 50 m and 80 m hub height based on these tables the power and energy densities present variations from site to site and as the height increases the power and wind energy densities increase as well moreover the variations of wind power and wind energy densities at the offshore locations are higher than onshore locations since the wind power density and energy density depend on the wind speed the variations of these two parameters agree with the variations of the mean wind speed in general location p6 has the highest value of power and energy densities and location p12 has the lowest according to table 7 comparatively the highest 18 year mean wind power density at 50 m and 80 m hub height are found in p6 with values of 323 96 w m 2 and 104 86 w m 2 respectively while the lowest is in p12 with values of 25 15 w m 2 and 28 91 w m 2 respectively in the seasonality view the results show that the maximum wind power and wind energy densities occur in winter whereas the minimum values belong to summer 6 6 4 performance assessment of wind turbines two wind turbines models vestas v39 and vestas v136 are chosen to simulate their performance in shallow water locations p1 p4 p5 p8 p10 p11 and p12 because both selected turbines are usually installed on onshore areas the specifications of selected turbines are given in table 9 the performance of selected turbines is examined at two heights of 50 m and 80 m the operating probability of wind turbines at each location can be determined by eq 14 table 10 shows the operating probability of wind turbines at selected onshore locations in general the operating probability of vestas v136 is higher than vestas v39 in all studied locations it can be said that the operating probability reduces with increasing cut in speed the highest operating probability of vestas v39 and vestas v136 is obtained in p10 on the contrary for these turbines p12 has the lowest operating probability in the seasonality view the highest and the lowest overall mean of operating probability are happened in winter and fall respectively the capacity factor c f is one of the most important parameters for site selection which can be calculated using by 15 the c f of the selected wind turbines are illustrated in table 11 as seen from this table it can be said that in general the c f of vestas v136 is higher than vestas v39 because the wind speed at 80 m is higher than that at 50 m data given in table 11 indicates that at different time scales c f variations are not significant the highest c f values are generally observed in winter and springtime whereas the lowest values are observed in fall and summertime in terms of spatially mean the c f values are the highest at location p10 and the lowest at location p12 7 conclusions this study was comprehensively investigated the wind characteristics and wind energy potential in the persian gulf based on the 18 year 2000 2017 era5 reanalysis wind data set the annual seasonal and monthly wind speed weibull probability distributions at different heights power and energy density distributions and power capacity factors of two commercial wind turbines were presented in detail moreover 12 potential sites were identified near the industrial or populated cities around the persian gulf based on wind characteristics the results of the present study lead to the following conclusions the central parts of the studied area have the highest wind energy potential especially in wintertime the prevailing wind directions are north and northwest in most of the regions energy densities in offshore are higher than in onshore regions the wind speed and its energy in northern coastlines of the persian gulf are lower than the southern parts in the eastern parts and in the strait of hormuz region the wind speed and wind energy are lower compared to other parts moreover the wind is more energetic in the northwestern part than in the southeastern part the spatial distribution of annual mean wind speed and wind power density over 18 year were indicated that the maximum wind speed varied from 4 to 6 m s with 60 120 w m2 wind power density in most parts of the persian gulf also the 18 year mean annual wind speed and wind power density are approximately 4 8 m s and 70 6 w m2 respectively the long term hourly 18 year data was indicated that the maximum wind speed in the studied area is 20 43 m s in the year 2008 based on over 18 year seasonal mean the wind speed was higher in winter up to 7 m s and decreased during spring up to 6 m s and fall up to 5 5 m s to reach the lowest values in summer up to 5 m s as a result winter prevails for the higher wind power density up to 210 w m2 followed by spring up to 130 w m2 fall up to 100 w m2 and summer up to 80 w m2 the spatial distributions of the highest mean wind speed and wind power density during winter spring summer and fall are located in the center and northwestern center northwestern and center and northwestern of the persian gulf respectively the highest 18 year monthly mean of wind speed and wind power density up to 7 m s and 220 w m2 respectively occurred in january february and december in the central part of the area during winter time shamal wind while the lowest up to 5 m s and 60 w m2 respectively occur in august and september no significant diurnal variation of the mean wind speed was observed the mean wind speed increases from 0 a m till noon which reaches to the highest values and later slightly decreases in general wind speed and wind power density have good conditions in terms of stability the onshore regions have the lowest temporal variability indices and the temporal variability increases towards the central parts of the persian gulf west and northwestern parts of the persian gulf were experienced higher variability than the east and southeastern in the east part strait of hormuz however the wind power density level is low the variability is also low which can be considered for small wind farm projects the 18 year annual mean wind power density at selected locations p1 to 12 was analyzed the wind power density for all locations was mostly less than 100 w m2 while p6 showed relatively higher wind power density the prevailing wind direction was slightly different at selected locations p1 to 12 the north and north west were the predominant directions the annual seasonal and monthly weibull parameters of 10 m wind speed were defined individually for each selected location the annual values of shape factor and scale factor are in the range of 1 76 3 01 and 2 76 6 88 m s respectively most probable wind speed and wind speed carrying maximum energy for each selected location were examined in accordance with the weibull distribution function in 18 year time period the highest and the lowest most probable wind speed belong to p9 and p12 respectively the highest and the lowest wind speed carrying maximum energy belong to p6 and p12 respectively in general the highest and the lowest values of these parameters belong to winter and summer respectively based on the weibull parameters the variations of the mean wind speed at 50 and 80 m hub height wind power density and wind energy density at different time scales were studied the variations of the wind power and wind energy densities agreed well with the variation of the mean wind speed two wind turbine models i e vestas v39 and vestas v136 at hub heights of 50 m and 80 m are selected for performance comparison the overall performance of vestas v136 was higher than vestas v39 in terms of the capacity factor

21484,despite the high capacity of wind energy in the offshore regions of iran seas wind power plants in these parts have not been significantly considered in this study the temporal and spatial wind characteristics and wind energy potential of the persian gulf are investigated during the years 2000 2017 based on the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era5 reanalysis data set

introduction the exploitation of renewable energy sources in the world has increased over the past decades due to the fossil fuel risks such as climate changes and severe air pollution in metropolitan areas gielen et al 2019 harjanne and korhonen 2019 wind energy has attracted considerable attention in recent years wind energy has many advantages such as sustainable available in large quantities and predictable behavior to design new concepts of wind energy technologies offshore wind energy has several advantages in comparison with onshore wind energy esteban et al 2011 shu et al 2015 first of all wind speed over the oceans is generally higher than those at nearby coastal locations faster offshore wind speed means much more energy can be harvested secondly the wind shear and turbulence are lower at offshore sites which allow the use of shorter offshore towers and reduce the fatigue loads on the wind turbines respectively thirdly offshore wind is more stable which means a more reliable source of energy finally the provision of coastal areas energy demands and the availability of sufficient space to build offshore wind farms are other benefits of offshore wind energy therefore regions located near the coastal areas have good potential to benefit from wind energy in comparison with other locations iran as a developing country is mostly dependent on fossil fuels although iran still relies heavily on fossil fuels the demand for energy is rapidly increasing and on the other hand some factors such as air pollution environmental problems and climate changes affecting the use of fossil fuels khojasteh et al 2018 mahmoodi et al 2019 the development of new energy technologies may assist in overcoming fossil fuel problems iran has a very long coastline which is surrounded by three vast seas in the north the caspian sea and south the persian gulf and the gulf of oman therefore wind energy especially in offshore areas is an untapped resource able to make a significant contribution to renewable energy generation in iran so far some studies have been carried out to examine the wind characteristics in iran and offshore and onshore areas of this country in the keyhani et al 2010 study the 3 h period measured long term wind speed data of the capital of iran tehran were statistically analyzed the probability density distributions were derived and the distribution parameters were identified the essential characteristics of wind energy at four zones in two provinces of iran north and south khorasan have been studied at the height of 10 m 30 m and 40 m saeidi et al 2011 the wind power potential and technical and economic feasibility of wind turbine installation in the shahrbabak city in kerman province are presented in mostafaeipour et al 2011 in the study alamdari et al 2012 10 min measuring wind speed data for the year 2007 at 10 m 30 m and 40 m heights for different places in iran has been statistically analyzed to determine the potential of wind power generation the hourly measured wind speed data for years 2007 2010 at 10 m 30 m and 40 m height for the binalood region in iran have been statically investigated mostafaeipour et al 2013 in rusu and onea 2013 based on both remotely sensed measurements and results provided by numerical models the wind and wave conditions of the caspian sea have been evaluated in mostafaeipour et al 2014 research five year 2003 2007 wind data has been analyzed to obtain wind power density and the wind energy potential in zahedan in amirinia et al 2017 research the uncertainties in determining the offshore wind and wave energies have been considered to estimate the wind and wave energy potentials in the southern caspian sea the wind and wave spatio temporal variability in the persian gulf using localized ecmwf wind data is investigated in kamranzad 2018 since wind energy is directly related to wind speed the accurate estimation of wind speed is crucial for all aspects of wind energy assessment to obtain useful knowledge about wind energy in a specific site it is necessary to analyze the wind speed frequency distribution wind power potential and plan econometrics of the selected site can be assessed using the data distribution the prediction of wind speed is carried out using the probability distribution functions wang et al 2016 there are several probability density functions such as weibull rayleigh gamma beta gaussian and log normal distribution which can be applied to demonstrate the wind speed frequency over a period of time aries et al 2018 mazzeo et al 2018 in particular the weibull probability distribution has been frequently applied in the literature katinas et al 2018 li et al 2018a özel et al 2015 shu et al 2015 due to its simplicity and providing adequate representation of the variation of wind speed over a period of time for this reason in the present study the weibull function is applied to fit the probability distribution of wind speed data in the studied area although the persian gulf has good potential in terms of wind energy in the offshore areas this source of energy is not taken into account significantly yet due to reasons such as the lack of quality data in these regions few studies have been specifically focused on the wind energy assessment in the persian gulf so far therefore a detailed wind energy assessment is required to determine energy opportunities across the offshore and onshore areas the main aim of this study is to investigate the spatio temporal wind fields and its associated energy for the persian gulf from 2000 to 2017 based on the ecmwf era5 reanalysis data set c3s 2017 the methodology presented in this paper concentrates on providing a better understanding of the long term temporal and spatial characteristics of the wind climate in this region to overcome limitations of studies mentioned above using a much higher spatial and temporal resolution era5 data set this is accomplished by determining the mean wind energy potential and its annual seasonal monthly and diurnal variations investigating the directional properties of wind and calculating the temporal variability indices of different time scales besides 12 locations are selected near the important areas or cities around the persian gulf to evaluate the site specific wind energy for the selected sites in terms of wind speed and wind direction moreover the weibull distribution function is applied to fit and describe the wind speed frequency over time due to its simplicity and high level of accuracy on the other hand the obtained results are applied to evaluate the wind power density at hub height and assess the potential of the studied area for installing the commercial wind turbines to generate electricity most probable wind speed and wind speed carrying maximum energy operating probability of both selected wind turbine prototypes and their capacity factor are also calculated for the 12 selected locations the procedure and methods presented in this study can be used as a reference or guideline to assess the wind energy potential in the rest of the world the rest of this paper is structured as follows in section 2 the study area and the corresponding data source are introduced the details of the weibull distribution function are presented in section 3 the methodologies used to characterize the wind energy resources and the temporal variability indices are described in sections 4 and 5 respectively in section 6 the main results including the spatio temporal distribution of wind power density of the studied area and their annual seasonal monthly and diurnal variations wind energy assessment in the overall area and selected locations and statistical analysis of the wind parameters are proposed finally some concluding remarks are presented in section 7 2 study area and data sources the considered area in this study is the persian gulf located in the south part of iran and adjacent to the arabian peninsula it is surrounded by iran iraq kuwait bahrain saudi arabia qatar and the united arab emirates fig 1 shows the geographic locations of the studied area in this study based on the 10 m neutral wind speed and 10 m neutral wind direction data provided by the era5 reanalysis data set from the ecmwf the spatio temporal characteristics of wind fields in the persian gulf from 2000 to 2017 with 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution and hourly temporal resolution are analyzed the neutral wind which is in the direction of the surface stress obtains from the roughness length and surface stress by assuming that the air is neutrally stratified c3s 2017 in stable conditions the neutral wind is slower than the actual wind while in the unstable conditions it is faster to download the data set and get further details about the studied wind parameters can be seen the website http climate copernicus eu climate reanalysis 3 weibull distribution function the weibull probability distribution function of wind speed f v is depicted as shu et al 2015 1 f v k c v c k 1 e v c k v 0 k 0 c 0 where k is the shape parameter dimensionless and c is scale parameter m s the parameter k determines the width of the data distribution plot which reflects how the wind distribution is peaking and parameter c indicates how windy a location is several methods such as optimization algorithms and numerical methods have been used to estimate the weibull parameters in the previous studies wang et al 2018 some of these methods are the moment method standard deviation method energy pattern factor method mle method cuckoo search algorithm particle swarm optimization algorithm and grey wolf optimizer algorithm in this study the mle method is employed the parameters k and c are obtained according to the following equations wang et al 2018 2 k i 1 n v i k l n v i i 1 n v i k 1 n i 1 n l n v i 1 3 c 1 n i 1 n v i k 1 k where v i is the wind speed and n is the number of measurements when parameters of weibull distribution functions k r and c r at a reference height h r are known then k z and c z for altitude h z above anemometer level are obtained using the following equations katinas et al 2018 4 k z k r 1 0 0881 l n h r 10 1 0 0881 l n h z 10 5 c z c r h z h r n here reference height h r is considered as 10 m and the value of the power law index n is adopted as 0 11 according to hsu et al 1994 shu et al 2015 generally the n value depends on the surface roughness and atmospheric stability katinas et al 2018 4 wind energy indicators 4 1 wind power and wind energy densities wind power density estimation is necessary to evaluate how much energy is available at a specific site the wind power density is dependent on the wind speed and air density the wind power per unit area or the wind power density can be calculated by li et al 2018b 6 p 1 2 ρ v 3 where p is the wind power per unit area in w m 2 the air density ρ is often adopted as 1 225 kg m3 at temperature 15 c the estimated weibull parameters can be directly utilized to assess wind power density based on the weibull probability density function wind power density can be calculated using the following equation 7 p 1 2 ρ c 3 γ 1 3 k where γ is the gamma function which has a standard form of 8 γ x 0 t x 1 e t d t the wind energy density for a specific period t in hours is defined as follows 9 e p t where p can be calculated using eqs 6 and 7 4 2 most probable wind speed and wind speed carrying maximum energy the peak of a given probability distribution function shows the most probable value of studied wind speed data set v m p the v m p in terms of shape and scale factors of the weibull distribution can be expressed as shu et al 2015 10 v m p c 1 1 k 1 k the wind speed carrying maximum energy v m a x e is defined as follows 11 v m a x e c 1 2 k 1 k 4 3 wind speed at the hub height in terms of the weibull distribution function the mean wind speed v can be obtained as follows katinas et al 2018 12 v c γ 1 1 k wind speed values should be extrapolated to the hub height of turbines in wind power applications the wind speed change with altitude can be calculated by using wind shear power law as liu et al 2019 13 v z v r h z h r n where v z is the wind speed at the height h z v r is the wind speed at the reference height h r which is considered at 10 m above ground level and n 0 11 is selected 4 4 operating probability of wind turbines the cut in and cut out wind speeds are two essential parameters for the operation of wind turbines the cut in speed denotes the minimum wind speed at which the turbine blades overcome friction and begin to rotate to generate useable power whereas the cut out wind speed represents the speed at which the turbine blades are brought to rest to avoid damage from extreme winds for most available wind turbines the cut in speed is in the range of 3 5 m s while the cut out speed can be as high as 25 m s shu et al 2015 the operating probability of wind turbines can be evaluated by the cumulative weibull distribution function 14 p v cut in v v cut out e v cut in c k e v cut out c k where v cut in and v cut out denote and cut in and cut out wind speed respectively 4 5 wind turbine capacity factor the capacity factor c f is defined as the ratio of the average power output in a certain period to the rated electrical power i e running full time at rated power li et al 2018a it is possible to calculate wind turbine c f based on the weibull distribution function as follows liu et al 2019 15 c f e v cut in c k e v rated c k v rated c k v cut in c k e v cut out c k where v rated is the rated wind speed 5 temporal variability indices the temporal variability is necessary to specify the regions that the wind field is stable and energy production has a slight change more stable locations are usually better to develop wind farm plans in this paper four coefficients gonçalves et al 2018 including the coefficient of variation c o v the seasonal variability index s v the monthly variability index m v and the annual variability a v are used to evaluate the temporal variability of wind speed and wind energy c o v is obtained by dividing the standard deviation σ by the mean μ of a series which is expressed as follows 16 c o v σ μ p p 2 p where the overbar denotes the mean and p is the parameter that we want to calculate its temporal variability the a v is expressed as 17 a v p a 1 p a 2 p y e a r where p a 1 and p a 2 are the mean p of the most and the least energetic year respectively p y e a r is the yearly mean here calculated over the 18 years the s v can be defined as 18 s v p s 1 p s 2 p y e a r where p s 1 and p s 2 are the mean p of the most and the least energetic season respectively the m v is defined as follows 19 m v p m 1 p m 2 p y e a r where p m 1 and p m 2 are the mean p of the most and the least energetic month respectively 6 results and discussions in this section the spatio temporal characteristics of wind are analyzed in the overall persian gulf for the period of 18 year 2000 2017 in terms of annual seasonal monthly and diurnal variations the spatial resolution of the used data set is 0 5 0 5 a three layer input hidden output feed forward neural network ffnn khosravi et al 2018 mahmoodi et al 2017 marugán et al 2018 navas et al 2019 vaghefi et al 2018 with 10 hidden neurons is used to fit studied parameters between main data points levenberg marquardt back propagation with tangent sigmoid activation function for the hidden layer is used as the training algorithm which is implemented in matlab software the latitude and longitude of era5 model points are considered as network input while the studied wind parameter is considered as network output to validate the created ffnn models two criteria including the correlation coefficient r and mean error bias are calculated according to eq 20 and eq 21 respectively 20 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 21 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 where x i and y i are observed and predicted values respectively and x and y are their average values respectively of n total samples the performance parameters r and r m s e are calculated for each created ffnn model 18 year annual seasonal monthly and diurnal wind speed and wind direction and the best model is chosen based on their value the best obtained model has the least r m s e and the maximum r 2 as a sample the regression plot and error histogram of the created ffnn models for the 18 year annual mean 10 m wind speed and wind direction are shown in fig 2 as observed in this figure it can be said that the ffnn models give an acceptable approximation of the annual mean of wind speed and wind direction in general the ffnn method is relatively provided better results for the wind speed and wind direction of unknown latitudes and longitudes of the studied area 6 1 annual wind power density distribution the 18 year annual mean spatial distribution of 10 m wind speed and wind power density based on eq 6 is shown in fig 3 according to this figure wind speed is varied from 4 to 6 m s with 60 120 w m2 wind power density in most parts of the persian gulf the highest wind speed greater than 5 5 m s and the highest wind power density greater than 100 w m2 occur especially in the central parts of the persian gulf the wind power density along the onshore is relatively lower than the offshore due to land effects moreover unlike the northern parts of the persian gulf most of the southern parts have higher wind speed values hence higher mean wind power density is expected from the southern parts the annual variation of wind speed and wind power density is summarized using the box plot in fig 4 moreover in this figure right side the concepts of the box plot are presented base on fig 4 it is found that the trend of wind speed in different years is negligible the overall annual mean wind speed is 4 70 m s and the highest annual mean wind speed appears in the year 2000 6 10 m s followed by year 2011 6 06 m s year 2004 5 95 m s and year 2013 5 89 m s while the lowest belongs to the year 2010 5 16 m s followed by the year 2017 5 45 m s interquartile range iqr is the difference between the first and third quartiles in the box plot diagram the year 2011 exhibits the highest iqr 1 21 m s which denotes the high variability of wind speed among all years while the lowest belongs to the year 2017 iqr 0 92 m s these results are also valid for wind power density to assess the directional distribution of the 18 year annual mean wind speed in the persian gulf the rose plot of the mean wind data is shown in fig 5 based on this figure it can be said that the northwest direction plays an important role in most directions of the persian gulf the predominant direction is due to the shamal wind which blows from north and northwest over the persian gulf and often is active during the day and decreases at night liao and kaihatu 2016 6 2 seasonal wind power density distribution the 18 year seasonal mean spatial distribution of wind speed and wind power density is shown in fig 6 according to fig 6 a the mean wind speed is higher during winter comparing to the other seasons this is due to the general atmospheric circulation at this period of the year the lowest wind speeds occurred in the summer it should be noted that the difference between the fall and the summer is negligible the mean wind speed increases in the summer fall spring and becomes more energetic in the winter in winter the highest mean wind speed is about 6 5 m s which occurs in the central part of the persian gulf around 50 52 5 e longitudes and 25 5 27 5 n latitudes while it is about 5 m s during fall and summer in the northwestern parts of the area moreover in spring the higher wind speed of more than 6 m s appears in the central part of the area researches in kamranzad 2018 thoppil and hogan 2010 reported the mean wind speed values of 5 m s and 5 9 m s for the winter in the persian gulf fig 6 b shows the mean seasonal spatial distribution of wind power density generally the locations of the highest wind power density are similar to the highest wind speeds the highest wind power density is about 220 w m2 and occurs in the winter while the lowest occurs in summer in all seasons the wind power density between 50 and 100 w m2 occurs in most of the persian gulf the box plot of the 18 year seasonal mean wind speed and wind power density is presented in fig 7 based on this figure the highest and the lowest variations of the wind speed and wind power density are occurred in winter and fall due to higher iqr respect to other seasons the larger iqr means more variability in the data the box plot of summer is comparatively shorter than other seasons which suggests that overall data have a high level of agreement with each other the directional distribution of the 18 year seasonal mean wind speed is plotted as wind roses in fig 8 as shown in this figure the wind distribution pattern varies in different seasons but similarly the prevailing wind direction is northwest in all seasons 6 3 monthly wind power density distribution fig 9 presents the spatial distribution of the 18 year monthly mean of the wind speed and wind power density according to fig 9 a the highest mean wind speed occurs in january february and december in the central part of the area during winter time shamal while the lowest occurs in august and september which is due to the predominant shamal wind which blows in winter and summer from the north or northwest over the persian gulf fig 10 b shows the monthly mean spatial distribution of the 18 year of wind power density generally it can be seen that the distribution of wind power density is similar to the wind speed the highest wind power density 220 w m2 arises in january february and december while the lowest occurs in august and september the box plot of the 18 year monthly mean of wind speed and wind power density of the overall studied area is presented in fig 10 the monthly mean of wind speed and wind power density are increased in december january and february and decreased during march and april subsequently these parameters are increased in may and june and then reduced until they reach their lowest level in august afterward wind speed and wind power density are raised again in september october and november to demonstrate the distribution of the wind speed and its direction the 18 year monthly mean wind rose of the overall studied area is presented in fig 11 as observed from this figure the prevailing wind direction is northwest in most months 6 4 diurnal wind power density distribution the 18 year diurnal mean wind speed and wind power density of the whole studied area are illustrated in fig 12 extreme values beyond the whiskers are displayed using mark according to fig 12 a it can be observed that the variations in the diurnal mean wind speeds are relatively small and the day time wind speed is higher in comparison to the night time the mean wind speed increases from 0 a m till noon which reaches the highest values and later slightly decreases it should be noted that to improve the display of box plots all data are not shown in fig 12 based on fig 12 b likewise the diurnal variation of the wind power density follows that of the mean wind speed at each hour of the day the variation of the wind power density is also small within 24 h the highest wind power densities are generally found during 11 12 a m and 1 2 pm 6 5 temporal variability the temporal variability distribution of the wind speed and wind power density is presented in figs 13 and 14 based on these figures it can be found that the onshore regions have the lowest temporal variability indices and the temporal variability increases towards the central parts of the persian gulf although the central areas of the persian gulf are energetic their stability is lower than in the onshore areas generally west and northwestern parts of the studied area experience higher variability rather than east strait of hormuz and southeastern based on figs 13 and 14 the m v is larger than the s v and the s v is larger than the a v wind speed highest values of a v s v and m v are in the range of 0 14 0 19 0 3 0 39 and 0 45 0 61 respectively moreover the wind power density highest values of a v s v and m v are in the range of 0 40 0 55 0 90 1 23 and 1 20 1 65 respectively therefore it can be said that wind power density has a higher variability with respect to wind speed consequently it can be generally concluded that wind speed and wind energy in the persian gulf have good stability 6 6 wind power density characteristics in the selected locations in order to study the characteristics of wind power density in different regions 12 locations are selected near the important areas or cities around the persian gulf table 1 the onshore points p1 to p5 northern coasts and p8 to p12 southern coasts are representing the coastal part of the populated or industrial regions around the studied area locations p6 and p7 are selected randomly in the near central parts of the persian gulf fig 15 presents the box plot of the 18 year annual mean wind power density at selected locations p1 to p12 according to this figure the 18 year annual wind power density for all locations except p6 is mostly less than 100 w m2 while p6 gives relatively more considerable wind power density the central points p6 and p7 have a higher amount of power respect to onshore areas with the annual mean power range up to 113 w m2 among the locations of the northern coasts of the studied area p1 to p5 the locations p2 has the highest mean wind power density the annual mean wind power density at the southern location p8 to p12 ranges between 10 and 98 7 w m2 where the highest annual mean wind power density corresponds to p6 about 98 7 w m2 while the lowest correspond to p12 approximately 10 86 w m2 to achieve more details about wind power density status table 2 presents the 18 year annual seasonal and monthly mean of the wind power density during 2000 2017 at selected locations p1 to p12 moreover the variability indices of these locations are depicted in table 3 as seen in table 2 the response of the wind power density is different according to the locations the location p12 has the lowest wind power density among all locations while p6 has the highest wind power density in many locations relatively large wind power density can be found in winter while the lowest occurred in the fall the highest mean wind power density in winter spring summer and fall is at locations p6 p6 p8 and p9 respectively this is due to the winter and summer time shamal winds affect the center and northwestern of the persian gulf respectively generally the mean wind power density during all seasons is more robust in the southern location respect to northern based on table 2 the highest mean wind power density exists in january february and december for most locations while the lowest belongs to august p6 has the highest mean wind power density from january to june also the highest mean wind power density during july august november and december belongs to p6 locations p8 and p9 have the highest mean wind power density from july to september and october respectively the wind power density at p12 is considerably low in all the months with the maximum in march 14 19 w m2 according to table 3 the location p6 experiences higher variation mean wind power density with respect to other locations while location p4 is more stable than other locations another essential parameter to wind energy resource assessment and site selection is the occurrence percentage of wind speed table 4 presents the 18 year occurrence percentage of the wind speed at selected locations p1 to p12 according to this table it can be observed that wind speed in the study area is mostly between 2 and 4 m s followed by 4 6 m s for all locations in addition to wind speed wind direction is also an important parameter in energy assessment the 18 year annual mean wind power density roses corresponding to 12 selected points are presented in fig 16 which provide useful information on the distribution of wind direction and availability of directional wind speed as seen from this figure the northwest is the dominant direction in most of the locations except p4 p5 and p12 the dominant direction of locations p4 and p12 is north and the dominant direction of p5 is northeast directions from the northwest to the southeast are the most common wind directions due to the predominant shamal wind 6 6 1 most probable wind speed and wind speed carrying maximum energy for the following analysis the shape k and scale c parameters of the annual seasonal and monthly wind speed are calculated using eqs 2 and 3 respectively as a sample fig 17 presents the weibull distribution function to the 18 year annual mean wind speed at each location the obtained weibull parameters can be used to calculate the most probable wind speed v m p and the wind speed carrying maximum energy v m a x e based on eqs 10 and 11 v m p denotes the most frequent wind speed of a given wind probability distribution while v m a x e is the wind speed that produces most of the energy the temporal variation of v m p and v m a x e at selected locations p1 to p12 are illustrated in table 5 as this table indicates the values of v m p and v m a x e are altered from the different locations during the different time periods but they do not have an obvious discrepancy in 18 year time period the highest and the lowest v m p belong to p9 and p12 respectively the highest and the lowest v m a x e belong to p6 and p12 respectively the highest values of v m p and v m a x e in most locations are visible in winter and they have the lowest values in summer moreover the highest seasonal mean of v m p and v m a x e correspond to p9 and p6 respectively locations p9 p6 p8 and p9 have the highest values of v m p in winter spring summer and fall respectively while the lowest value of v m p belongs to p12 in all seasons 6 6 2 wind speed at the hub height usually wind turbines have hub heights higher than 10 m therefore the mean extrapolated wind speed derived with theoretical methods using eqs 12 and 13 for the 12 selected locations at 10 50 and 80 m hub height are shown in table 6 in this table v 10 v 50 and v 80 are the mean wind speed at 10 50 and 80 m respectively as seen from table 6 the wind speed is lower at lower altitudes and is increased at higher altitudes moreover the wind speed at the offshore locations is typically higher than onshore locations 6 6 3 wind power and wind energy densities at the hub height as the weibull parameters are determined the corresponding wind power density and wind energy densities can be calculated by eqs 7 and 9 respectively tables 7 and 8 present the temporal variation of mean wind power and mean wind energy densities of selected locations p1 to p12 at 50 m and 80 m hub height based on these tables the power and energy densities present variations from site to site and as the height increases the power and wind energy densities increase as well moreover the variations of wind power and wind energy densities at the offshore locations are higher than onshore locations since the wind power density and energy density depend on the wind speed the variations of these two parameters agree with the variations of the mean wind speed in general location p6 has the highest value of power and energy densities and location p12 has the lowest according to table 7 comparatively the highest 18 year mean wind power density at 50 m and 80 m hub height are found in p6 with values of 323 96 w m 2 and 104 86 w m 2 respectively while the lowest is in p12 with values of 25 15 w m 2 and 28 91 w m 2 respectively in the seasonality view the results show that the maximum wind power and wind energy densities occur in winter whereas the minimum values belong to summer 6 6 4 performance assessment of wind turbines two wind turbines models vestas v39 and vestas v136 are chosen to simulate their performance in shallow water locations p1 p4 p5 p8 p10 p11 and p12 because both selected turbines are usually installed on onshore areas the specifications of selected turbines are given in table 9 the performance of selected turbines is examined at two heights of 50 m and 80 m the operating probability of wind turbines at each location can be determined by eq 14 table 10 shows the operating probability of wind turbines at selected onshore locations in general the operating probability of vestas v136 is higher than vestas v39 in all studied locations it can be said that the operating probability reduces with increasing cut in speed the highest operating probability of vestas v39 and vestas v136 is obtained in p10 on the contrary for these turbines p12 has the lowest operating probability in the seasonality view the highest and the lowest overall mean of operating probability are happened in winter and fall respectively the capacity factor c f is one of the most important parameters for site selection which can be calculated using by 15 the c f of the selected wind turbines are illustrated in table 11 as seen from this table it can be said that in general the c f of vestas v136 is higher than vestas v39 because the wind speed at 80 m is higher than that at 50 m data given in table 11 indicates that at different time scales c f variations are not significant the highest c f values are generally observed in winter and springtime whereas the lowest values are observed in fall and summertime in terms of spatially mean the c f values are the highest at location p10 and the lowest at location p12 7 conclusions this study was comprehensively investigated the wind characteristics and wind energy potential in the persian gulf based on the 18 year 2000 2017 era5 reanalysis wind data set the annual seasonal and monthly wind speed weibull probability distributions at different heights power and energy density distributions and power capacity factors of two commercial wind turbines were presented in detail moreover 12 potential sites were identified near the industrial or populated cities around the persian gulf based on wind characteristics the results of the present study lead to the following conclusions the central parts of the studied area have the highest wind energy potential especially in wintertime the prevailing wind directions are north and northwest in most of the regions energy densities in offshore are higher than in onshore regions the wind speed and its energy in northern coastlines of the persian gulf are lower than the southern parts in the eastern parts and in the strait of hormuz region the wind speed and wind energy are lower compared to other parts moreover the wind is more energetic in the northwestern part than in the southeastern part the spatial distribution of annual mean wind speed and wind power density over 18 year were indicated that the maximum wind speed varied from 4 to 6 m s with 60 120 w m2 wind power density in most parts of the persian gulf also the 18 year mean annual wind speed and wind power density are approximately 4 8 m s and 70 6 w m2 respectively the long term hourly 18 year data was indicated that the maximum wind speed in the studied area is 20 43 m s in the year 2008 based on over 18 year seasonal mean the wind speed was higher in winter up to 7 m s and decreased during spring up to 6 m s and fall up to 5 5 m s to reach the lowest values in summer up to 5 m s as a result winter prevails for the higher wind power density up to 210 w m2 followed by spring up to 130 w m2 fall up to 100 w m2 and summer up to 80 w m2 the spatial distributions of the highest mean wind speed and wind power density during winter spring summer and fall are located in the center and northwestern center northwestern and center and northwestern of the persian gulf respectively the highest 18 year monthly mean of wind speed and wind power density up to 7 m s and 220 w m2 respectively occurred in january february and december in the central part of the area during winter time shamal wind while the lowest up to 5 m s and 60 w m2 respectively occur in august and september no significant diurnal variation of the mean wind speed was observed the mean wind speed increases from 0 a m till noon which reaches to the highest values and later slightly decreases in general wind speed and wind power density have good conditions in terms of stability the onshore regions have the lowest temporal variability indices and the temporal variability increases towards the central parts of the persian gulf west and northwestern parts of the persian gulf were experienced higher variability than the east and southeastern in the east part strait of hormuz however the wind power density level is low the variability is also low which can be considered for small wind farm projects the 18 year annual mean wind power density at selected locations p1 to 12 was analyzed the wind power density for all locations was mostly less than 100 w m2 while p6 showed relatively higher wind power density the prevailing wind direction was slightly different at selected locations p1 to 12 the north and north west were the predominant directions the annual seasonal and monthly weibull parameters of 10 m wind speed were defined individually for each selected location the annual values of shape factor and scale factor are in the range of 1 76 3 01 and 2 76 6 88 m s respectively most probable wind speed and wind speed carrying maximum energy for each selected location were examined in accordance with the weibull distribution function in 18 year time period the highest and the lowest most probable wind speed belong to p9 and p12 respectively the highest and the lowest wind speed carrying maximum energy belong to p6 and p12 respectively in general the highest and the lowest values of these parameters belong to winter and summer respectively based on the weibull parameters the variations of the mean wind speed at 50 and 80 m hub height wind power density and wind energy density at different time scales were studied the variations of the wind power and wind energy densities agreed well with the variation of the mean wind speed two wind turbine models i e vestas v39 and vestas v136 at hub heights of 50 m and 80 m are selected for performance comparison the overall performance of vestas v136 was higher than vestas v39 in terms of the capacity factor at selected onshore locations the present results can be used directly to develop wind energy plans in the persian gulf credit authorship contribution statement kumas mahmoodi conceptualization data
