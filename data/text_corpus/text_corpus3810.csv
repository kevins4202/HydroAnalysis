19050,metal free photocatalysts have attracted growing concern in recent years in this work a new class of carbon quantum dots cqds modified porous graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 is synthesized via a facile polymerization method with the optimal cqds loading the cqds modified g c3n4 exhibits 15 times higher degradation kinetic towards diclofenac dcf than that of pure g c3n4 the enhanced photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the improved separation of charge carriers as well as the tuned band structure moreover a photosensitation like mechanism is proposed to elucidate the photo generated electrons transfer and reactive radicals formation cqds are anchored to g c3n4 surface via c o bond which provide channels for the preferential transfer of photo excited electrons on dcf molecule to the conduction band of g c3n4 superoxide radical o2 dominates the degradation of dcf while holes h show a negligible contribution density functional theory dft calculation successfully predicts that the sites on dcf molecule with high fukui index f 0 are preferable to be attacked by radicals dcf degradation pathway mainly includes ring hydroxylation ring closure and c n bond cleavage processes acute toxicity estimation indicates the formation of less toxic intermediates products compared to dcf after photocatalysis moreover the hybrid photocatalysts exhibit good reusability in five consecutive cycles this work not only proposes a deep insight into photosensitation like mechanism in the photocatalysis system by using c3n4 based materials but also develops new photocatalysts for potential application on removal of emerging organic pollutants from waters and wastewaters graphical abstract image 1 keywords diclofenac photocatalytic degradation carbon quantum dots carbon nitride visible light 1 introduction diclofenac dcf is a one of the most popular non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids which is widely used all over the world chen et al 2018 li et al 2018 mcgettigan and henry 2013 however due to its low biodegradability dcf is frequently detected in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants and surface water vieno and sillanpaa 2014 moreover although the concentrations of dcf were found to be at the level of several μg l or ng l in the environment lonappan et al 2016 the potential adverse effects towards human health or ecosystem still have attracted great concerns bort et al 1999 oaks 2004 moreover the toxicity of dcf can be further amplified by the bioaccumulation in the tissues of organisms due to its high log k ow octanol water partition coefficient value 4 5 sanderson et al 2003 therefore it is crucial to develop novel technologies for dcf removal advanced oxidation processes aops have been recognized as one of the most effective technologies for the elimination of organic pollutants including dcf chong et al 2017 rizzo et al 2009 shao et al 2017 among these technologies visible light driven vld photocatalytic oxidation is confirmed to be promising due to its high efficiency and potential utilization of solar energy rizzo et al 2009 up till now various photocatalysts including tio2 based rizzo et al 2009 bi based chen et al 2018 and ag based zhang et al 2017 semiconductors have been developed and found to be efficient for dcf removal however most of these photocatalysts may release heavy or noble metal ions which pose risks of secondary pollution in case of metal release from photocatalysts thus metal free photocatalysts are considered green materials for further large scale applications as a metal free photocatalyst graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 has attracted tremendous attention because of its suitable band gap 2 7 ev high stability facile synthesis as well as the low cost of raw materials li et al 2016b wang et al 2017a xu et al 2017 however in spite of the progress in the synthetic routes the photocatalytic activity of g c3n4 was still limited by the strong recombination of charge carriers due to the weak van der waals interactions between adjacent cn layers zhang et al 2016 although coupling with other semiconductors has been proven to be effective to inhibit the charge recombination very limited metal free materials were available dong et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 tian et al 2014 wang et al 2013 recently studies about a novel kind of small carbon nanoparticles less than 10 nm in size with some form of surface passivation wang and hu 2014 carbon quantum dots cqds provide a promising alternative dadigala et al 2017 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 cqds can act as an electron acceptor to direct the transport of photo generated charge carriers enhanced vld photocatalytic h2 generation via the decoration of cqds onto the surface of g c3n4 was also recently reported li et al 2016a liu et al 2016 qin and zeng 2017 wang et al 2017b xu et al 2017 very recently chen et al 2018 found that the decoration of carbon quantum dots cqds onto the surface of biocooh enhanced the photocatalytic degradation of dcf via improving the charge separation similarly photocatalytic activity of g c3n4 is expected to be improved after cqds modification in this study cqds modified g c3n4 materials was fabricated via a facile thermal polymerization method the decoration of cqds did not obviously affect the morphology and structure of g c3n4 yet significantly alter the optical properties which induced different effects on the photocatalytic degradation of dcf the mechanism on enhanced vld photocatalytic activity of g c3n4 after cqds modification was deeply explored by means of characterization and radical production measurement moreover a widely concerned pharmaceutical dcf was selected as the target pollutant and the degradation pathway of dcf was speculated via both intermediates identification and theoretical calculation based on dft fukui index the underlying mechanism on photocatalytic degradation of organics with specific structures by g c3n4 based photocatalysts was also fully discussed which is of great importance to better understanding the key reactions in different photocatalysis systems in addition the toxicity degradation intermediates products of dcf were evaluated through quantitative structure activity relationship qsar prediction the effect of ph and the photo stability of the photocatalyst were also investigated 2 methods and materials 2 1 chemical reagents diclofenac sodium was provided by sigma aldrich st louis mo usa citric acid urea tert butanol tba ammonium oxalate ao p benzoquinone p bq terephthalic acid ta and nitroblue tetrazolium nbt were obtained from sinopharm corporation ltd shanghai china all the chemical reagents were used as received without further purification 2 2 synthesis of cqds and cqds modified carbon nitride the cqds were fabricated via a modified hydrothermal based on previous studies wang et al 2017a in a typical procedure 15 0 g of citric acid and 5 0 g of urea were firstly dissolved in 75 ml deionized di water then the mixture was transferred to a teflon sealed autoclave to undergo a hydrothermal process at 180 c for 5 h after natural cooling to room temperature the harvested dark brown suspension was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min to remove the bulk particles the obtained cqds solution was stocked at 4 c for subsequent synthetic procedures the cqds modified carbon nitride cnc was synthesized via a facile polymerization method in a typical procedure 10 g of urea and a desired amount of cqds stock solution was mixed in 30 ml di water to form a transparent solution then the solution was transferred into a 40 ml crucible and dried at 60 c overnight the obtained brown solids were subsequently heated to 550 c for 3 h with a heating rate of 15 c min 1 the cncs composites fabricated with different amount of cqds stock solution 20 50 100 and 200 μl were denoted to be cnc1 4 respectively in addition pure g c3n4 was also fabricated via the same method except for the addition of cqds 2 3 characterizations the crystal structures of the fabricated photocatalysts were characterized on a dmax 2400 diffractometer rigaku japan with cu kα λ 0 154 nm irradiation at 40 kv and 100 ma fourier transform infrared ftir spectra were recorded with a nicolet 6700 spectrophotometer thermofisher the morphology and microstructures were characterized by fei nova nano scanning electron microscopic 430 sem and fei tecnai f30 high resolution transmission electron microscope hrtem x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analyses were conducted by an axis ultra kratos analytical ltd imaging photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatized al kα anode the uv vis diffuse reflectance uv drs spectra were recorded for the dry pressed disk samples by a perkinelmer lambda 650s spectrophotometer by using baso4 as a reference the photoluminescence pl spectra were analyzed by a varian cary eclipse spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 315 nm the n2 adsorption desorption analysis was measured on an autosorb iq c instrument quantachrome corporation 2 4 photocatalytic tests the photocatalytic experiments were carried out using the devices displayed in fig s1 a uv cutoff filter λ 400 nm was placed between the light source 300w xenon arc lamp cel hxf300 beijing jin yuan technology co and reactor to exclude the ultraviolet irradiation the light spectrum fig s2 at the surface of the reaction suspension confirmed the exclusion of uv and the light intensity was detected to be 150 5 mw cm2 tm 207 tenmars electronics co the reaction temperature was maintained at 25 0 0 2 c by a circulating water bath for typical photocatalytic trials 10 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed in 50 ml dcf solution 10 mg l 1 with stirring then the ph of the suspension was adjusted to the desired values with 0 1 m naoh or hcl solution prior to light irradiation the mixture was magnetically stirred for 30 min in darkness to obtain an adsorption desorption equilibrium between photocatalysts and dcf during the photocatalytic experiments 1 ml of the reaction suspension was collected and immediately filtrated by a 0 22 μm nylon membrane the concentration of dcf was detected by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 usa the temperature of agilent xdb c18 column 2 1 100 mm 3 5 μm was maintained at 25 c and the wavelength of the ultraviolet detector was 276 nm the mobile phase consisted of 70 acetonitrile and 30 water containing 0 2 acetic acid with a flow rate of 0 8 ml min 1 zhai et al 2018 photocatalytic degradation of dcf is described by the pseudo first order kinetic model simplified from the langmuir hinshelwood l h model liu et al 2014 2018 which is expressed as 1 in c t c 0 k 1 t where c 0 and c t mg l are the dfc concentrations at initial and time t min respectively and k 1 min 1 is the first order rate constant 2 5 reactive species detection and degradation intermediates identification the role of various kinds of reactive species was indirectly investigated via a scavenger experiment in a typical trial scavengers including 100 μm tert butanol tba 1 mm ammonium oxalate ao and 50 μm p benzoquinone p bq were individually added into the reaction system to quench hydroxyl radical oh photo generated holes h and superoxide radical o2 respectively the effect of certain scavenger on the photocatalytic activity reflects the role of the corresponding reactive species moreover the presence of oh and o2 were also detected by the electron spin resonance esr technique in addition to the qualitative characterization the accumulative generation of oh and o2 were also quantified by using terephthalic acid ta and nirtoblue tetrazolium nbt as probe molecules details about the quantification of oh and o2 methods text s1 and esr analysis text s2 can be found in previous studies tang et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 as well as in the supplementary data to further clarify the photocatalytic mechanism involved in the degradation of dcf the degradation intermediates within the experimental duration were determined with a liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms details on the intermediates detection by using lc ms are shown in the supplementary data the mineralization of dcf was investigated by the removal of total organic carbon toc samples for the detection of toc were collected at different intervals and measured through combustion catalytic oxidation at 680 c by a toc meter toc lcph shimadzu japan in addition chemical computation was also employed to clarify the degradation pathways of dcf 2 6 theoretical calculation the computational calculation based on density functional theory dft was performed on a gaussian 03 package frisch et al 2009 fukui function representing electrophilic f nucleophilic f and radical attack f 0 is used to evaluate the reactive sites on the dcf molecule details on dft calculation can be found in text s3 of the supplementary data 2 7 reusability the reusability of cncs was studied in five consecutive recycle experiments after each cycle the photocatalyst were collected by filtration through 0 22 μm membrane the harvested photocatalysts were soaked in 60 ml ethyl alcohol overnight and subsequently dried at 60 c for 2 h the obtained photocatalysts were ready for the next cycle 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations the xrd patterns of the as prepared photocatalysts g c3n4 and cnc1 4 are shown in fig 1 a two distinct diffraction peaks at 2θ 27 5 and 13 0 were observed for all the five samples which are indexed to g c3n4 jcpds no 87 1526 the stronger peak at 2θ 27 5 was assigned to 002 diffraction plane originated from interlayer stacking structure of conjugated aromatic system qin and zeng 2017 while the weaker one at 2θ 13 0 corresponded to the in plane structural packing motif of tri s triazine units li et al 2016a however compared to pure g c3n4 there is almost no change in the xrd patterns after cqds modification indicating that the incorporation of cqds did not significantly alter the crystal structure of g c3n4 moreover no diffraction peak for cqds was observed due to its relatively small amount 4 wt and low crystallinity ding et al 2016 fig 1b displays the ftir spectra of g c3n4 and cncs several vibration bands at 1000 1700 cm 1 could be attributed to the c n stretching vibrations in the cn heterocycles wang et al 2017a the band at 806 cm 1 originated from the vibration mode of s triazine unit while the broad vibration bands at 3000 3400 cm 1 corresponded to the free amino groups n h and surface adsorbed hydroxyl species c oh jian et al 2016 qin and zeng 2017 whereas pure g c3n4 and cncs exhibited similar fitr spectra indicating that the introduction of cqds did not significantly alter the chemical structure of pure g c3n4 in order to further characterize the surface composition and chemical state of pure g c3n4 and cnc2 xps analyses were conducted survey xps spectra fig 1c shows that both g c3n4 and cnc2 mainly consisted of c and n and no impurity was detected the atom ratio of c and n was 0 83 for g c3n4 while the value increased to 0 91 for cnc2 due to the incorporation of cqds as shown in the high resolution spectra of c 1s fig 1d the characteristic peaks at 284 8 ev and 288 3 ev could be indexed to the c c and sp2 hybridized carbon within the triazine rings n c n wang et al 2018 the peak positions did not shift after the introduction of cqds indicating that cqds showed negligible effect on the original structure of triazine rings which was consistent with the results in xrd analysis whereas the characteristic peak at 286 3 ev corresponding to c o species exhibited a small shift 286 4 ev after the cqds modification the hydroxyl groups c oh coordinated with c atoms on the surface of both g c3n4 and cqds could bridge with each other to form c o c bond by losing one h2o molecule the xps results suggest that cqds might load onto the surface of g c3n4 via the formation of c o bond the n 1s spectra fig 1e could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 398 7 ev 400 0 ev and 401 1 ev which corresponded to sp2 bonded n c n c in triazine rings tertiary n in n c 3 and amino groups n h respectively wang et al 2017a moreover the positions of these peaks did not change with the introduction of cqds indicating that the cqds did not connect to g c3n4 via n containing chemical bonds thus all the results above demonstrated that cqds were deposited on the surface of g c3n4 via c o c bond while the original structure of g c3n4 almost did not change the morphologies of as synthesized photocatalysts were characterized via tem and sem analyses as shown in fig 2 a pure g c3n4 exhibited as numerous ultrathin paper fold sheets which was consistent with previous studies dong et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 2014 the sizes of the single dispersed carbon quantum dots are within 10 nm fig 2b and the lattice stripes with a spacing of 0 22 nm still can be distinguished despite the low crystallization fig 2e dadigala et al 2017 prior to cqds modification the g c3n4 sheets were relative smooth fig 2b in contrast lots of carbon quantum dots were uniformly decorated on the surface of g c3n4 in the tem image of cnc2 fig 2c and f while some carbon dots aggregated into larger particles with the diameters of 10 20 nm during the thermal polymerization of cnc2 in addition sem images fig s3 show that all the samples displayed a porous but amorphous morphology to further characterize the specific surface area and pore size distribution of the photocatalysts n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were detected fig s4a results show that both pure g c3n4 and cnc2 exhibit type iv curves with type h3 hysteresis loops at a high relative pressure within the range of 0 75 1 00 p p 0 which indicate the mesoporous structure liang et al 2018 the measured bet surface area of g c3n4 is as high as 90 6 m2 g 1 suggesting the highly porous structure of g c3n4 synthesized in this study the large surface area can be ascribed to the generation of ammonia during the polymerization process which act as the bubble gas xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 although the bet specific surface area of cnc2 decreases to 37 5 m2 g 1 because of the conjunction of neighbor g c3n4 nanosheets via cqds bridging high porous structure and large surface area of skeleton g c3n4 still implies abundant active sites for photocatalytic reaction thus will greatly promote target organic contaminant degradation barrett joyner halenda bjh pore diameter analyses fig s4b also show that pores with the diameter of 14 20 nm decrease after cqds modification the band structures of g c3n4 as well as cnc2 were further characterized by valence band xps vb xps the vb maxima of g c3n4 and cnc2 were detected to be 2 22 ev and 2 16 ev respectively the negligible shift of vb maxima can be explained by the linkage between cqds and g c3n4 the valance band edge of pure g c3n4 is mainly contributed by the triangular edge n atoms n 2p state while the conduction band edge is mainly dominated by the 2p states of n atoms and c atoms ma et al 2012 since cqds were connected to the surface of g c3n4 via c o bond the vb which mainly consisted of n atoms was not obviously affected similar results were also previously reported wang et al 2018 therefore the optical properties of the as prepared photocatalysts were further compared by means of uv drs and pl spectra uv drs spectra fig 3 b indicate that the visible light absorption of g c3n4 is greatly enhanced via cqds modification particularly the absorption edges of g c3n4 cnc1 and cnc2 are found to be 464 nm 485 nm and 550 nm corresponding to the band gaps e g of 2 67 ev 2 55 ev and 2 25 ev respectively dong et al 2013 moreover further increase of cqds amount enlarges the absorption edge into infrared region which may not benefit to visible light driven photocatalysis the oxidative reductive stress of photo generated holes electrons is positively correlated with the band gap of photocatalysts the red shift of adsorption edge means narrower band gap since the valance band of cnc is not affected by the cqds loading the conduction band edge becomes more and more positive which weaken the reductive stress of electrons on the conduction band of cnc this effect will compensate the increase of harvest of visible light irradiation thus the red shift of absorption edge may not enhance photocatalytic activity according to the results of uv drs spectra and vb xps the energy band of g c3n4 and cnc2 are schematically illustrated in fig 3c it can be observed that the incorporation of cqds mainly decreases the conduction band cb potential of cnc2 by 0 36 ev while hardly affects the vb potential obviously the presence of cqds provides relatively lower empty orbitals for the conduction band of cnc2 otherwise the strong emission peak in the pl spectra of g c3n4 is significantly suppressed by the introduction of cqds fig 3d suggesting that the separation of h and e is improved by cqds modification liang et al 2015 both the broaden utilization spectrum of visible light as well as the suppression of charge carriers recombination contribute to the enhanced visible light driven photocatalytic activity of cncs wang et al 2017a 3 2 photocatalytic degradation of dcf by various cncs the vld photocatalytic activities of the as fabricated cncs and pure g c3n4 for the removal of dcf are presented in fig 4 a under dark condition the adsorption desorption equilibrium between dcf and photocatalysts were obtained within 30 min yet almost no adsorption was observed in addition the photolysis of dcf in the absence of photocatalyst did not contribute to removal within 60 min due to the high recombination rate of h and e pure g c3n4 exhibited relative low photocatalytic activity toward dcf removal only 19 3 of dcf could be removed by pure g c3n4 at 60 min in contrast cncs with cqds modified show much higher photocatalytic degradation efficiency of dcf specifically the removal efficiency of dcf by cnc1 4 within 60 min are 49 5 100 96 1 and 71 6 respectively in addition cnc2 with optimal cqds content cnc2 exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity as the pseudo first order rate constant k 1 for cnc2 is calculated to be 7 4 10 2 min 1 which is over 15 times more than that of pure g c3n4 4 9 10 3 min 1 as stated above cqds on the surface of g c3n4 can both enhance the visible light absorption and improve the separation of h and e therefore the vld photocatalytic activities of cncs are obviously higher than pure g c3n4 although cqds serve as active sites so excess amount of cqds will lead to a shield effect and inhibit photocatalysis wang et al 2018 as a result the photocatalytic activity of cnc3 and cnc4 decreased even with higher cqds loading therefore cnc2 with highest photocatalytic activity was used for subsequent tests to explore the effects of ph on the degradation kinetics experiments were also conducted at various ph 5 9 results show that alkaline condition facilitates degradation as complete degradation of dcf can be achieved within 12 min at ph 9 with a high k 1 value of 0 47 min 1 in comparison the k 1 value at ph 5 is only 3 2 10 2 min 1 the observation is highly related to the photocatalytic degradation mechanism towards dcf which will be systematically discussed in the following sections 3 3 role of reactive species in dcf photocatalytic degradation to clarify the role of reactive species during the photocatalytic degradation of dcf different kinds of quenchers were added into the reaction system respectively it is found that the degradation kinetic is almost not affected by the addition of ao which indicates that h is not responsible for the degradation of dcf fig 5 a however the k 1 values for dcf degradation are decreased from 0 14 min 1 to 9 0 10 2 min 1 by tba and 2 7 10 3 min 1 by p bq respectively fig 5b indicating that both oh and o2 contribute to dcf degradation and o2 playes the dominate role fig 5b the generation of oh and o2 by cnc2 under visible light irradiation were also qualitatively confirmed by the esr results fig s5 although some background peaks emerge due to the weak reaction of material and solvent under dark condition characteristic peaks corresponding to oh and o2 are clearly observed under visible light irradiation specially in fig s5a no obvious change is observed before and after visible light irradiation indicating that the generation of oh by g c3n4 is limited in fig s5d the strong background peaks are weakened and new peaks assigned to o2 appear under visible light irradiation suggesting that production of o2 by cnc2 only occurs upon light irradiation to further quantify the generation of oh and o2 ta and nbt were selected as the molecular probes respectively liang et al 2016 however oh is not detected in the reaction system probably due to its small amount which agrees well with the minor contribution in contrast the generation of o2 is clearly detected in esr spectra figs s5c and s5d and the generation amount follows the order cnc2 cnc3 cnc4 cnc1 g c3n4 fig 5c which is consistent with the photocatalytic activity order shown in fig 4 in addition the accumulative generation of o2 by cnc2 under visible light was measured to be 0 44 μm within the experimental duration and the accumulative o2 concentration level of 10 1 μm was consistent with that reported in other photocatalytic systems liang et al 2017 obregón et al 2016 ye et al 2012 2013 in addition to the accumulative concentration the steady state concentration of o2 was also estimated based on the relationship below zhao et al 2014 2 r i n t k n b t o 2 n b t o 2 s s the degradation of nbt follows pseudo first order kinetic model as shown in eq 2 r int is the initial degradation rate of nbt μm s 1 k n b t o 2 is the reaction rate constant of nbt and o2 which is reported to be 5 88 104 m 1 s 1 bielski et al 1980 nbt is the initial concentration of nbt 1 25 μm and o2 ss is the steady state concentration of superoxide radical r int was determined to be 1 56 10 4 μm s 1 fig s6 and o2 ss was calculated to be 2 13 10 9 m since o2 was found to play the primary role the capture of e by o2 became the rate determining step for the degradation of dcf under alkaline condition the enhanced adsorption of oh affects the electronegativity of atoms on the surface of cnc2 butler and ginley 1978 dutoit et al 1976 leading to a potential drop of conduction band e cb ward et al 1983 this shift given by 3 e cb e cb ph 0 0 059 ph at 25 c o results in greater reducing power of e which contributes to the generation of o2 therefore the degradation of dcf by cnc2 under visible light irradiation is favored by higher ph value the vld photocatalytic mechanisms for organic pollutants degradation are generally classified into two strategies narrow sense photocatalytic degradation liang et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 and photosensitation liang et al 2018 lu et al 2014 xiong et al 2013 as illustrated in fig 6 a and b the photocatalytic degradation of dcf was found to be a o2 dominated process while h almost did not make any contribution therefore the narrow sense photocatalytic degradation cannot well explain the photocatalysis process observed in this study on the other hand in a typical photosensitation process electrons on the highest occupied molecular orbital homo of the organic pollutant are first activated to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo then the activated electrons will be further transferred to the conduction band of photocatalyst and then captured by o2 to form o2 therefore the photosensitation theory does not include the participation of h however it can only be applied for the degradation of molecules with strong visible light adsorption lu et al 2014 xiong et al 2013 since the adsorption spectrum of dcf mainly concentrated in the uv region encinas et al 1998 photosensitation cannot fully explain the mechanism neither paul et al 2007 found that organic molecules with no visible light absorption also could be degraded by tio2 through photocatalysis even under visible light irradiation via a unique mechanism similar to photosensitation and the degradation did not depend on the role of h inspired by this study a photosensitation like mechanism is proposed here to elucidate the degradation of dcf by cnc2 under visible light irradiation as shown in fig 6c electrons on the homo of dcf are first activated by the visible light irradiation and further injected into the cb of cnc2 instead of being activated to the lumo of dcf molecule as stated above the incorporation of cqds mainly lowers the cb of cnc2 yet hardly affects the vb edge the lower empty orbitals of cqds on the cb of cnc2 act as intermediate levels between the homo of dcf and the cb of g c3n4 which benefit the photocatalytic efficiency moreover paul et al 2007 found that the photo excited electrons on the organic molecules transferred to the surface of tio2 via a ligand to metal charge transfer lmct mechanism where ti atoms acted as a bridge since the conduction band of tio2 is composed of ti atoms mo and ching 1995 the lmct facilitates the electrons transfer to the conduction band of tio2 likewise it is suggested herein that the transfer bridge between the photo excited electrons on dcf molecules and cnc surfaces are the c atoms on cqds to further explore the role of cqds quenching experiments were also conducted for pure g c3n4 results show that g c3n4 share almost the same photolysis mechanism with cnc2 for the degradation of dcf which does not include the contribution of h fig s7 the observation indicates that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of cnc can be ascribed to improved charge transfer by the incorporation of cqds since anchored to g c3n4 surface via c o c bond cqds provide channel for the transfer of photo excited electrons from dcf molecules to the cb of g c3n4 leading to higher photocatalytic activity of cnc than that of neat g c3n4 in the absent of photocatalyst the electrons of dcf is restricted on the homo because the visible light photons do not provide enough energy to overcome the homo lumo gap however once dcf molecule contact with cqds the empty orbits on cqds provide alternative for the visible light excited electrons once the energy of orbits on cqds are lower than the lumo of dcf the charge transfer will be facilitated the activated electrons on the cb of g c3n4 then undergo a reaction pathway similar with the photosensitation process to generate o2 in addition to the direct reaction with dcf a small portion of o2 would transfer into oh leading to a minor contribution fig 6c it is interesting that photosensitation like mechanism dominates the degradation of dcf by cqds modified g c3n4 in this study and this mechanism may give a new sight on reactions in visible light driven photocatalysis in the presence of c3n4 based catalysts however the underlying photocatalytic mechanism is related to the types of photocatalysts as well as the structures of target organic contaminants the electron excitation and transfer are key processes during photocatalysis therefore more works are needed for further understanding the photocatalysis and photosensitation mechanisms in the future 3 4 degradation pathways of dcf dft calculation and acute toxicity estimation to clarify the degradation pathway of dcf by cnc2 under visible light irradiation lc ms analysis and chemical computation based on dft were employed table s1 listed the detected degradation intermediates moreover to further elucidate the degradation pathway the natural population analysis npa charge distribution and fukui index representing radical attack f 0 of the atoms on dcf molecule were calculated and shown in fig 7 a and b the atoms marked with red circles in fig 7a hold relative larger f 0 fig 7b including c5 cl11 n12 and 20c are more vulnerable to radical attack combined with the detected intermediates and fukui index the degradation pathway of dcf is proposed in fig 7c the initial steps of the degradation are classified into three main routes ring hydroxylation photocyclization and c n bond cleavage salaeh et al 2016 sarasidis et al 2014 first for the ring hydroxylation reaction the c5 atom with the highest f 0 0 09342 is easy to be attacked by oh leading to the formation of hydroxylated dcf a then compound a undergoes hydrogen loss leading to the formation of quinone imine structure b or further hydroxylates on cl11 atom resulting in chlorine losing d subsequently n12 atoms in the intermediates above b and d will be attacked and eventually result in c n bond cleavage to form c and e secondly photocyclization process originates from the attack of cl11 atom with the fourth highest f 0 0 07089 by o2 or oh leading to the loss of chlorine and hydrogen atoms as well as the subsequent structural rearrangement to form compound f martínez et al 2011 moreover n12 atom on f can further undergo c n cleavage to form e gou et al 2017 thirdly n12 atom with the second highest f 0 0 09055 may also be directly attacked the c n cleavage and subsequent deethylation directly break dcf molecule into small molecules g and h finally all the above mentioned intermediates will be further attacked by o2 or oh and broken into smaller molecules or mineralized into co2 and h2o the toc removal of the reaction suspension was detected to be 54 within 90 min fig s8 which revealed that dcf might be mineralized with extended time in this study the acute toxicity bioaccumulation factor developmental toxicity and mutagenicity of dcf as well as its degradation intermediates products were assessed by quantitative structure activity relationship qsar prediction using toxicity estimation software tool t e s t intermediates with quinone imine structure b and d in fig 7c are not included in the data base probably due to their low stability as shown in fig 8 a the ld50 of dcf for rat is 244 mg kg which is considered as very toxic nearly all the degradation intermediates of dcf show higher ld50 except intermediate h indicating the decreased acute toxicity for the intermediates especially for intermediate c however even for intermediate c the ld50 is still considered as toxic fig 8b and c reveal that the photocatalytic degradation process significantly decrease the bioaccumulation factor and development toxicity of dcf compared with original dcf for instance the bioaccumulation factors are decreased by 55 28 79 78 37 and 28 respectively for intermediates a c d e f g and h compared with that for dcf in addition dcf is a developmental toxicant while the treatment process lower the toxicity of all degradation intermediates and intermediates e g and h are even developmental non toxicant the dcf is mutagenicity positive the treatment process decreases the mutagenicity of intermediates to mutagenicity negative except intermediate f from the calculated results the degradation process can alleviate the toxicity of dcf but most of the intermediates are still toxic therefore although complete removal of dcf can be obtained within 50 min the degradation duration should be extended to at least 90 min to obtain better mineralization 3 5 reusability fig 9 shows removal of dcf by cnc2 over five reuse cycle cnc2 exhibites excellent reusability and the removal efficiency of dcf maintaines over 90 even in the fifth cycle therefore cnc2 holding good photo stability is a promising material for practical applications 4 conclusions carbon quantum dots cqds modified porous graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 is successfully synthesized via a facile polymerized method cqds are evenly decorated onto the surface of g c3n4 without altering the skeletal structure of g c3n4 cqds modification greatly enhances the photocatalytic activity of g c3n4 while excess amount of cqds block the light adsorption therefore cnc2 exhibits the best photocatalytic performance which exceeds 15 times higher than pure g c3n4 based on the first order rate constant k 1 for dcf degradation the degradation mechanism is found to be a o2 dominated photosensitation like process the presence of cqds broadens the absorption spectrum of g c3n4 and act as charge carriers for photo generated electrons e resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity of cncs in addition higher ph contributes to dcf removal through decreasing the conduction band potential which promotes the generation of o2 the active atoms with high fukui index interpret the ring hydroxylation photocyclization and c n bond cleavage under the attack of reactive radicals the toxicity of dcf is alleviated during the degradation process according to the calculation by quantitative structure activity relationship qsar prediction the as prepared photocatalysts show excellent photo stability during recycle experiments the study provides a class of promising materials for efficient removal of emerging contaminants from wastewaters conflicts of

19050,metal free photocatalysts have attracted growing concern in recent years in this work a new class of carbon quantum dots cqds modified porous graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 is synthesized via a facile polymerization method with the optimal cqds loading the cqds modified g c3n4 exhibits 15 times higher degradation kinetic towards diclofenac dcf than that of pure g c3n4 the enhanced photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the improved separation of charge carriers as well as the tuned band structure moreover a photosensitation like mechanism is proposed to elucidate the photo generated electrons transfer and reactive radicals formation cqds are anchored to g c3n4 surface via c o bond which provide channels for the preferential transfer of photo excited electrons on dcf molecule to the conduction band of g c3n4 superoxide radical o2 dominates the degradation of dcf while holes h show a negligible contribution density functional theory dft calculation successfully predicts that the sites on dcf molecule with high fukui index f 0 are preferable to be attacked by radicals dcf degradation pathway mainly includes ring hydroxylation ring closure and c n bond cleavage processes acute toxicity estimation indicates the formation of less toxic intermediates products compared to dcf after photocatalysis moreover the hybrid photocatalysts exhibit good reusability in five consecutive cycles this work not only proposes a deep insight into photosensitation like mechanism in the photocatalysis system by using c3n4 based materials but also develops new photocatalysts for potential application on removal of emerging organic pollutants from waters and wastewaters graphical abstract image 1 keywords diclofenac photocatalytic degradation carbon quantum dots carbon nitride visible light 1 introduction diclofenac dcf is a one of the most popular non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids which is widely used all over the world chen et al 2018 li et al 2018 mcgettigan and henry 2013 however due to its low biodegradability dcf is frequently detected in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants and surface water vieno and sillanpaa 2014 moreover although the concentrations of dcf were found to be at the level of several μg l or ng l in the environment lonappan et al 2016 the potential adverse effects towards human health or ecosystem still have attracted great concerns bort et al 1999 oaks 2004 moreover the toxicity of dcf can be further amplified by the bioaccumulation in the tissues of organisms due to its high log k ow octanol water partition coefficient value 4 5 sanderson et al 2003 therefore it is crucial to develop novel technologies for dcf removal advanced oxidation processes aops have been recognized as one of the most effective technologies for the elimination of organic pollutants including dcf chong et al 2017 rizzo et al 2009 shao et al 2017 among these technologies visible light driven vld photocatalytic oxidation is confirmed to be promising due to its high efficiency and potential utilization of solar energy rizzo et al 2009 up till now various photocatalysts including tio2 based rizzo et al 2009 bi based chen et al 2018 and ag based zhang et al 2017 semiconductors have been developed and found to be efficient for dcf removal however most of these photocatalysts may release heavy or noble metal ions which pose risks of secondary pollution in case of metal release from photocatalysts thus metal free photocatalysts are considered green materials for further large scale applications as a metal free photocatalyst graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 has attracted tremendous attention because of its suitable band gap 2 7 ev high stability facile synthesis as well as the low cost of raw materials li et al 2016b wang et al 2017a xu et al 2017 however in spite of the progress in the synthetic routes the photocatalytic activity of g c3n4 was still limited by the strong recombination of charge carriers due to the weak van der waals interactions between adjacent cn layers zhang et al 2016 although coupling with other semiconductors has been proven to be effective to inhibit the charge recombination very limited metal free materials were available dong et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 tian et al 2014 wang et al 2013 recently studies about a novel kind of small carbon nanoparticles less than 10 nm in size with some form of surface passivation wang and hu 2014 carbon quantum dots cqds provide a promising alternative dadigala et al 2017 xu et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 cqds can act as an electron acceptor to direct the transport of photo generated charge carriers enhanced vld photocatalytic h2 generation via the decoration of cqds onto the surface of g c3n4 was also recently reported li et al 2016a liu et al 2016 qin and zeng 2017 wang et al 2017b xu et al 2017 very recently chen et al 2018 found that the decoration of carbon quantum dots cqds onto the surface of biocooh enhanced the photocatalytic degradation of dcf via improving the charge separation similarly photocatalytic activity of g c3n4 is expected to be improved after cqds modification in this study cqds modified g c3n4 materials was fabricated via a facile thermal polymerization method the decoration of cqds did not obviously affect the morphology and structure of g c3n4 yet significantly alter the optical properties which induced different effects on the photocatalytic degradation of dcf the mechanism on enhanced vld photocatalytic activity of g c3n4 after cqds modification was deeply explored by means of characterization and radical production measurement moreover a widely concerned pharmaceutical dcf was selected as the target pollutant and the degradation pathway of dcf was speculated via both intermediates identification and theoretical calculation based on dft fukui index the underlying mechanism on photocatalytic degradation of organics with specific structures by g c3n4 based photocatalysts was also fully discussed which is of great importance to better understanding the key reactions in different photocatalysis systems in addition the toxicity degradation intermediates products of dcf were evaluated through quantitative structure activity relationship qsar prediction the effect of ph and the photo stability of the photocatalyst were also investigated 2 methods and materials 2 1 chemical reagents diclofenac sodium was provided by sigma aldrich st louis mo usa citric acid urea tert butanol tba ammonium oxalate ao p benzoquinone p bq terephthalic acid ta and nitroblue tetrazolium nbt were obtained from sinopharm corporation ltd shanghai china all the chemical reagents were used as received without further purification 2 2 synthesis of cqds and cqds modified carbon nitride the cqds were fabricated via a modified hydrothermal based on previous studies wang et al 2017a in a typical procedure 15 0 g of citric acid and 5 0 g of urea were firstly dissolved in 75 ml deionized di water then the mixture was transferred to a teflon sealed autoclave to undergo a hydrothermal process at 180 c for 5 h after natural cooling to room temperature the harvested dark brown suspension was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min to remove the bulk particles the obtained cqds solution was stocked at 4 c for subsequent synthetic procedures the cqds modified carbon nitride cnc was synthesized via a facile polymerization method in a typical procedure 10 g of urea and a desired amount of cqds stock solution was mixed in 30 ml di water to form a transparent solution then the solution was transferred into a 40 ml crucible and dried at 60 c overnight the obtained brown solids were subsequently heated to 550 c for 3 h with a heating rate of 15 c min 1 the cncs composites fabricated with different amount of cqds stock solution 20 50 100 and 200 μl were denoted to be cnc1 4 respectively in addition pure g c3n4 was also fabricated via the same method except for the addition of cqds 2 3 characterizations the crystal structures of the fabricated photocatalysts were characterized on a dmax 2400 diffractometer rigaku japan with cu kα λ 0 154 nm irradiation at 40 kv and 100 ma fourier transform infrared ftir spectra were recorded with a nicolet 6700 spectrophotometer thermofisher the morphology and microstructures were characterized by fei nova nano scanning electron microscopic 430 sem and fei tecnai f30 high resolution transmission electron microscope hrtem x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analyses were conducted by an axis ultra kratos analytical ltd imaging photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatized al kα anode the uv vis diffuse reflectance uv drs spectra were recorded for the dry pressed disk samples by a perkinelmer lambda 650s spectrophotometer by using baso4 as a reference the photoluminescence pl spectra were analyzed by a varian cary eclipse spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 315 nm the n2 adsorption desorption analysis was measured on an autosorb iq c instrument quantachrome corporation 2 4 photocatalytic tests the photocatalytic experiments were carried out using the devices displayed in fig s1 a uv cutoff filter λ 400 nm was placed between the light source 300w xenon arc lamp cel hxf300 beijing jin yuan technology co and reactor to exclude the ultraviolet irradiation the light spectrum fig s2 at the surface of the reaction suspension confirmed the exclusion of uv and the light intensity was detected to be 150 5 mw cm2 tm 207 tenmars electronics co the reaction temperature was maintained at 25 0 0 2 c by a circulating water bath for typical photocatalytic trials 10 mg of photocatalyst was dispersed in 50 ml dcf solution 10 mg l 1 with stirring then the ph of the suspension was adjusted to the desired values with 0 1 m naoh or hcl solution prior to light irradiation the mixture was magnetically stirred for 30 min in darkness to obtain an adsorption desorption equilibrium between photocatalysts and dcf during the photocatalytic experiments 1 ml of the reaction suspension was collected and immediately filtrated by a 0 22 μm nylon membrane the concentration of dcf was detected by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 usa the temperature of agilent xdb c18 column 2 1 100 mm 3 5 μm was maintained at 25 c and the wavelength of the ultraviolet detector was 276 nm the mobile phase consisted of 70 acetonitrile and 30 water containing 0 2 acetic acid with a flow rate of 0 8 ml min 1 zhai et al 2018 photocatalytic degradation of dcf is described by the pseudo first order kinetic model simplified from the langmuir hinshelwood l h model liu et al 2014 2018 which is expressed as 1 in c t c 0 k 1 t where c 0 and c t mg l are the dfc concentrations at initial and time t min respectively and k 1 min 1 is the first order rate constant 2 5 reactive species detection and degradation intermediates identification the role of various kinds of reactive species was indirectly investigated via a scavenger experiment in a typical trial scavengers including 100 μm tert butanol tba 1 mm ammonium oxalate ao and 50 μm p benzoquinone p bq were individually added into the reaction system to quench hydroxyl radical oh photo generated holes h and superoxide radical o2 respectively the effect of certain scavenger on the photocatalytic activity reflects the role of the corresponding reactive species moreover the presence of oh and o2 were also detected by the electron spin resonance esr technique in addition to the qualitative characterization the accumulative generation of oh and o2 were also quantified by using terephthalic acid ta and nirtoblue tetrazolium nbt as probe molecules details about the quantification of oh and o2 methods text s1 and esr analysis text s2 can be found in previous studies tang et al 2017 zhao et al 2014 as well as in the supplementary data to further clarify the photocatalytic mechanism involved in the degradation of dcf the degradation intermediates within the experimental duration were determined with a liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms details on the intermediates detection by using lc ms are shown in the supplementary data the mineralization of dcf was investigated by the removal of total organic carbon toc samples for the detection of toc were collected at different intervals and measured through combustion catalytic oxidation at 680 c by a toc meter toc lcph shimadzu japan in addition chemical computation was also employed to clarify the degradation pathways of dcf 2 6 theoretical calculation the computational calculation based on density functional theory dft was performed on a gaussian 03 package frisch et al 2009 fukui function representing electrophilic f nucleophilic f and radical attack f 0 is used to evaluate the reactive sites on the dcf molecule details on dft calculation can be found in text s3 of the supplementary data 2 7 reusability the reusability of cncs was studied in five consecutive recycle experiments after each cycle the photocatalyst were collected by filtration through 0 22 μm membrane the harvested photocatalysts were soaked in 60 ml ethyl alcohol overnight and subsequently dried at 60 c for 2 h the obtained photocatalysts were ready for the next cycle 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations the xrd patterns of the as prepared photocatalysts g c3n4 and cnc1 4 are shown in fig 1 a two distinct diffraction peaks at 2θ 27 5 and 13 0 were observed for all the five samples which are indexed to g c3n4 jcpds no 87 1526 the stronger peak at 2θ 27 5 was assigned to 002 diffraction plane originated from interlayer stacking structure of conjugated aromatic system qin and zeng 2017 while the weaker one at 2θ 13 0 corresponded to the in plane structural packing motif of tri s triazine units li et al 2016a however compared to pure g c3n4 there is almost no change in the xrd patterns after cqds modification indicating that the incorporation of cqds did not significantly alter the crystal structure of g c3n4 moreover no diffraction peak for cqds was observed due to its relatively small amount 4 wt and low crystallinity ding et al 2016 fig 1b displays the ftir spectra of g c3n4 and cncs several vibration bands at 1000 1700 cm 1 could be attributed to the c n stretching vibrations in the cn heterocycles wang et al 2017a the band at 806 cm 1 originated from the vibration mode of s triazine unit while the broad vibration bands at 3000 3400 cm 1 corresponded to the free amino groups n h and surface adsorbed hydroxyl species c oh jian et al 2016 qin and zeng 2017 whereas pure g c3n4 and cncs exhibited similar fitr spectra indicating that the introduction of cqds did not significantly alter the chemical structure of pure g c3n4 in order to further characterize the surface composition and chemical state of pure g c3n4 and cnc2 xps analyses were conducted survey xps spectra fig 1c shows that both g c3n4 and cnc2 mainly consisted of c and n and no impurity was detected the atom ratio of c and n was 0 83 for g c3n4 while the value increased to 0 91 for cnc2 due to the incorporation of cqds as shown in the high resolution spectra of c 1s fig 1d the characteristic peaks at 284 8 ev and 288 3 ev could be indexed to the c c and sp2 hybridized carbon within the triazine rings n c n wang et al 2018 the peak positions did not shift after the introduction of cqds indicating that cqds showed negligible effect on the original structure of triazine rings which was consistent with the results in xrd analysis whereas the characteristic peak at 286 3 ev corresponding to c o species exhibited a small shift 286 4 ev after the cqds modification the hydroxyl groups c oh coordinated with c atoms on the surface of both g c3n4 and cqds could bridge with each other to form c o c bond by losing one h2o molecule the xps results suggest that cqds might load onto the surface of g c3n4 via the formation of c o bond the n 1s spectra fig 1e could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 398 7 ev 400 0 ev and 401 1 ev which corresponded to sp2 bonded n c n c in triazine rings tertiary n in n c 3 and amino groups n h respectively wang et al 2017a moreover the positions of these peaks did not change with the introduction of cqds indicating that the cqds did not connect to g c3n4 via n containing chemical bonds thus all the results above demonstrated that cqds were deposited on the surface of g c3n4 via c o c bond while the original structure of g c3n4 almost did not change the morphologies of as synthesized photocatalysts were characterized via tem and sem analyses as shown in fig 2 a pure g c3n4 exhibited as numerous ultrathin paper fold sheets which was consistent with previous studies dong et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 2014 the sizes of the single dispersed carbon quantum dots are within 10 nm fig 2b and the lattice stripes with a spacing of 0 22 nm still can be distinguished despite the low crystallization fig 2e dadigala et al 2017 prior to cqds modification the g c3n4 sheets were relative smooth fig 2b in contrast lots of carbon quantum dots were uniformly decorated on the surface of g c3n4 in the tem image of cnc2 fig 2c and f while some carbon dots aggregated into larger particles with the diameters of 10 20 nm during the thermal polymerization of cnc2 in addition sem images fig s3 show that all the samples displayed a porous but amorphous morphology to further characterize the specific surface area and pore size distribution of the photocatalysts n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were detected fig s4a results show that both pure g c3n4 and cnc2 exhibit type iv curves with type h3 hysteresis loops at a high relative pressure within the range of 0 75 1 00 p p 0 which indicate the mesoporous structure liang et al 2018 the measured bet surface area of g c3n4 is as high as 90 6 m2 g 1 suggesting the highly porous structure of g c3n4 synthesized in this study the large surface area can be ascribed to the generation of ammonia during the polymerization process which act as the bubble gas xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 although the bet specific surface area of cnc2 decreases to 37 5 m2 g 1 because of the conjunction of neighbor g c3n4 nanosheets via cqds bridging high porous structure and large surface area of skeleton g c3n4 still implies abundant active sites for photocatalytic reaction thus will greatly promote target organic contaminant degradation barrett joyner halenda bjh pore diameter analyses fig s4b also show that pores with the diameter of 14 20 nm decrease after cqds modification the band structures of g c3n4 as well as cnc2 were further characterized by valence band xps vb xps the vb maxima of g c3n4 and cnc2 were detected to be 2 22 ev and 2 16 ev respectively the negligible shift of vb maxima can be explained by the linkage between cqds and g c3n4 the valance band edge of pure g c3n4 is mainly contributed by the triangular edge n atoms n 2p state while the conduction band edge is mainly dominated by the 2p states of n atoms and c atoms ma et al 2012 since cqds were connected to the surface of g c3n4 via c o bond the vb which mainly consisted of n atoms was not obviously affected similar results were also previously reported wang et al 2018 therefore the optical properties of the as prepared photocatalysts were further compared by means of uv drs and pl spectra uv drs spectra fig 3 b indicate that the visible light absorption of g c3n4 is greatly enhanced via cqds modification particularly the absorption edges of g c3n4 cnc1 and cnc2 are found to be 464 nm 485 nm and 550 nm corresponding to the band gaps e g of 2 67 ev 2 55 ev and 2 25 ev respectively dong et al 2013 moreover further increase of cqds amount enlarges the absorption edge into infrared region which may not benefit to visible light driven photocatalysis the oxidative reductive stress of photo generated holes electrons is positively correlated with the band gap of photocatalysts the red shift of adsorption edge means narrower band gap since the valance band of cnc is not affected by the cqds loading the conduction band edge becomes more and more positive which weaken the reductive stress of electrons on the conduction band of cnc this effect will compensate the increase of harvest of visible light irradiation thus the red shift of absorption edge may not enhance photocatalytic activity according to the results of uv drs spectra and vb xps the energy band of g c3n4 and cnc2 are schematically illustrated in fig 3c it can be observed that the incorporation of cqds mainly decreases the conduction band cb potential of cnc2 by 0 36 ev while hardly affects the vb potential obviously the presence of cqds provides relatively lower empty orbitals for the conduction band of cnc2 otherwise the strong emission peak in the pl spectra of g c3n4 is significantly suppressed by the introduction of cqds fig 3d suggesting that the separation of h and e is improved by cqds modification liang et al 2015 both the broaden utilization spectrum of visible light as well as the suppression of charge carriers recombination contribute to the enhanced visible light driven photocatalytic activity of cncs wang et al 2017a 3 2 photocatalytic degradation of dcf by various cncs the vld photocatalytic activities of the as fabricated cncs and pure g c3n4 for the removal of dcf are presented in fig 4 a under dark condition the adsorption desorption equilibrium between dcf and photocatalysts were obtained within 30 min yet almost no adsorption was observed in addition the photolysis of dcf in the absence of photocatalyst did not contribute to removal within 60 min due to the high recombination rate of h and e pure g c3n4 exhibited relative low photocatalytic activity toward dcf removal only 19 3 of dcf could be removed by pure g c3n4 at 60 min in contrast cncs with cqds modified show much higher photocatalytic degradation efficiency of dcf specifically the removal efficiency of dcf by cnc1 4 within 60 min are 49 5 100 96 1 and 71 6 respectively in addition cnc2 with optimal cqds content cnc2 exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity as the pseudo first order rate constant k 1 for cnc2 is calculated to be 7 4 10 2 min 1 which is over 15 times more than that of pure g c3n4 4 9 10 3 min 1 as stated above cqds on the surface of g c3n4 can both enhance the visible light absorption and improve the separation of h and e therefore the vld photocatalytic activities of cncs are obviously higher than pure g c3n4 although cqds serve as active sites so excess amount of cqds will lead to a shield effect and inhibit photocatalysis wang et al 2018 as a result the photocatalytic activity of cnc3 and cnc4 decreased even with higher cqds loading therefore cnc2 with highest photocatalytic activity was used for subsequent tests to explore the effects of ph on the degradation kinetics experiments were also conducted at various ph 5 9 results show that alkaline condition facilitates degradation as complete degradation of dcf can be achieved within 12 min at ph 9 with a high k 1 value of 0 47 min 1 in comparison the k 1 value at ph 5 is only 3 2 10 2 min 1 the observation is highly related to the photocatalytic degradation mechanism towards dcf which will be systematically discussed in the following sections 3 3 role of reactive species in dcf photocatalytic degradation to clarify the role of reactive species during the photocatalytic degradation of dcf different kinds of quenchers were added into the reaction system respectively it is found that the degradation kinetic is almost not affected by the addition of ao which indicates that h is not responsible for the degradation of dcf fig 5 a however the k 1 values for dcf degradation are decreased from 0 14 min 1 to 9 0 10 2 min 1 by tba and 2 7 10 3 min 1 by p bq respectively fig 5b indicating that both oh and o2 contribute to dcf degradation and o2 playes the dominate role fig 5b the generation of oh and o2 by cnc2 under visible light irradiation were also qualitatively confirmed by the esr results fig s5 although some background peaks emerge due to the weak reaction of material and solvent under dark condition characteristic peaks corresponding to oh and o2 are clearly observed under visible light irradiation specially in fig s5a no obvious change is observed before and after visible light irradiation indicating that the generation of oh by g c3n4 is limited in fig s5d the strong background peaks are weakened and new peaks assigned to o2 appear under visible light irradiation suggesting that production of o2 by cnc2 only occurs upon light irradiation to further quantify the generation of oh and o2 ta and nbt were selected as the molecular probes respectively liang et al 2016 however oh is not detected in the reaction system probably due to its small amount which agrees well with the minor contribution in contrast the generation of o2 is clearly detected in esr spectra figs s5c and s5d and the generation amount follows the order cnc2 cnc3 cnc4 cnc1 g c3n4 fig 5c which is consistent with the photocatalytic activity order shown in fig 4 in addition the accumulative generation of o2 by cnc2 under visible light was measured to be 0 44 μm within the experimental duration and the accumulative o2 concentration level of 10 1 μm was consistent with that reported in other photocatalytic systems liang et al 2017 obregón et al 2016 ye et al 2012 2013 in addition to the accumulative concentration the steady state concentration of o2 was also estimated based on the relationship below zhao et al 2014 2 r i n t k n b t o 2 n b t o 2 s s the degradation of nbt follows pseudo first order kinetic model as shown in eq 2 r int is the initial degradation rate of nbt μm s 1 k n b t o 2 is the reaction rate constant of nbt and o2 which is reported to be 5 88 104 m 1 s 1 bielski et al 1980 nbt is the initial concentration of nbt 1 25 μm and o2 ss is the steady state concentration of superoxide radical r int was determined to be 1 56 10 4 μm s 1 fig s6 and o2 ss was calculated to be 2 13 10 9 m since o2 was found to play the primary role the capture of e by o2 became the rate determining step for the degradation of dcf under alkaline condition the enhanced adsorption of oh affects the electronegativity of atoms on the surface of cnc2 butler and ginley 1978 dutoit et al 1976 leading to a potential drop of conduction band e cb ward et al 1983 this shift given by 3 e cb e cb ph 0 0 059 ph at 25 c o results in greater reducing power of e which contributes to the generation of o2 therefore the degradation of dcf by cnc2 under visible light irradiation is favored by higher ph value the vld photocatalytic mechanisms for organic pollutants degradation are generally classified into two strategies narrow sense photocatalytic degradation liang et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 and photosensitation liang et al 2018 lu et al 2014 xiong et al 2013 as illustrated in fig 6 a and b the photocatalytic degradation of dcf was found to be a o2 dominated process while h almost did not make any contribution therefore the narrow sense photocatalytic degradation cannot well explain the photocatalysis process observed in this study on the other hand in a typical photosensitation process electrons on the highest occupied molecular orbital homo of the organic pollutant are first activated to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo then the activated electrons will be further transferred to the conduction band of photocatalyst and then captured by o2 to form o2 therefore the photosensitation theory does not include the participation of h however it can only be applied for the degradation of molecules with strong visible light adsorption lu et al 2014 xiong et al 2013 since the adsorption spectrum of dcf mainly concentrated in the uv region encinas et al 1998 photosensitation cannot fully explain the mechanism neither paul et al 2007 found that organic molecules with no visible light absorption also could be degraded by tio2 through photocatalysis even under visible light irradiation via a unique mechanism similar to photosensitation and the degradation did not depend on the role of h inspired by this study a photosensitation like mechanism is proposed here to elucidate the degradation of dcf by cnc2 under visible light irradiation as shown in fig 6c electrons on the homo of dcf are first activated by the visible light irradiation and further injected into the cb of cnc2 instead of being activated to the lumo of dcf molecule as stated above the incorporation of cqds mainly lowers the cb of cnc2 yet hardly affects the vb edge the lower empty orbitals of cqds on the cb of cnc2 act as intermediate levels between the homo of dcf and the cb of g c3n4 which benefit the photocatalytic efficiency moreover paul et al 2007 found that the photo excited electrons on the organic molecules transferred to the surface of tio2 via a ligand to metal charge transfer lmct mechanism where ti atoms acted as a bridge since the conduction band of tio2 is composed of ti atoms mo and ching 1995 the lmct facilitates the electrons transfer to the conduction band of tio2 likewise it is suggested herein that the transfer bridge between the photo excited electrons on dcf molecules and cnc surfaces are the c atoms on cqds to further explore the role of cqds quenching experiments were also conducted for pure g c3n4 results show that g c3n4 share almost the same photolysis mechanism with cnc2 for the degradation of dcf which does not include the contribution of h fig s7 the observation indicates that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of cnc can be ascribed to improved charge transfer by the incorporation of cqds since anchored to g c3n4 surface via c o c bond cqds provide channel for the transfer of photo excited electrons from dcf molecules to the cb of g c3n4 leading to higher photocatalytic activity of cnc than that of neat g c3n4 in the absent of photocatalyst the electrons of dcf is restricted on the homo because the visible light photons do not provide enough energy to overcome the homo lumo gap however once dcf molecule contact with cqds the empty orbits on cqds provide alternative for the visible light excited electrons once the energy of orbits on cqds are lower than the lumo of dcf the charge transfer will be facilitated the activated electrons on the cb of g c3n4 then undergo a reaction pathway similar with the photosensitation process to generate o2 in addition to the direct reaction with dcf a small portion of o2 would transfer into oh leading to a minor contribution fig 6c it is interesting that photosensitation like mechanism dominates the degradation of dcf by cqds modified g c3n4 in this study and this mechanism may give a new sight on reactions in visible light driven photocatalysis in the presence of c3n4 based catalysts however the underlying photocatalytic mechanism is related to the types of photocatalysts as well as the structures of target organic contaminants the electron excitation and transfer are key processes during photocatalysis therefore more works are needed for further understanding the photocatalysis and photosensitation mechanisms in the future 3 4 degradation pathways of dcf dft calculation and acute toxicity estimation to clarify the degradation pathway of dcf by cnc2 under visible light irradiation lc ms analysis and chemical computation based on dft were employed table s1 listed the detected degradation intermediates moreover to further elucidate the degradation pathway the natural population analysis npa charge distribution and fukui index representing radical attack f 0 of the atoms on dcf molecule were calculated and shown in fig 7 a and b the atoms marked with red circles in fig 7a hold relative larger f 0 fig 7b including c5 cl11 n12 and 20c are more vulnerable to radical attack combined with the detected intermediates and fukui index the degradation pathway of dcf is proposed in fig 7c the initial steps of the degradation are classified into three main routes ring hydroxylation photocyclization and c n bond cleavage salaeh et al 2016 sarasidis et al 2014 first for the ring hydroxylation reaction the c5 atom with the highest f 0 0 09342 is easy to be attacked by oh leading to the formation of hydroxylated dcf a then compound a undergoes hydrogen loss leading to the formation of quinone imine structure b or further hydroxylates on cl11 atom resulting in chlorine losing d subsequently n12 atoms in the intermediates above b and d will be attacked and eventually result in c n bond cleavage to form c and e secondly photocyclization process originates from the attack of cl11 atom with the fourth highest f 0 0 07089 by o2 or oh leading to the loss of chlorine and hydrogen atoms as well as the subsequent structural rearrangement to form compound f martínez et al 2011 moreover n12 atom on f can further undergo c n cleavage to form e gou et al 2017 thirdly n12 atom with the second highest f 0 0 09055 may also be directly attacked the c n cleavage and subsequent deethylation directly break dcf molecule into small molecules g and h finally all the above mentioned intermediates will be further attacked by o2 or oh and broken into smaller molecules or mineralized into co2 and h2o the toc removal of the reaction suspension was detected to be 54 within 90 min fig s8 which revealed that dcf might be mineralized with extended time in this study the acute toxicity bioaccumulation factor developmental toxicity and mutagenicity of dcf as well as its degradation intermediates products were assessed by quantitative structure activity relationship qsar prediction using toxicity estimation software tool t e s t intermediates with quinone imine structure b and d in fig 7c are not included in the data base probably due to their low stability as shown in fig 8 a the ld50 of dcf for rat is 244 mg kg which is considered as very toxic nearly all the degradation intermediates of dcf show higher ld50 except intermediate h indicating the decreased acute toxicity for the intermediates especially for intermediate c however even for intermediate c the ld50 is still considered as toxic fig 8b and c reveal that the photocatalytic degradation process significantly decrease the bioaccumulation factor and development toxicity of dcf compared with original dcf for instance the bioaccumulation factors are decreased by 55 28 79 78 37 and 28 respectively for intermediates a c d e f g and h compared with that for dcf in addition dcf is a developmental toxicant while the treatment process lower the toxicity of all degradation intermediates and intermediates e g and h are even developmental non toxicant the dcf is mutagenicity positive the treatment process decreases the mutagenicity of intermediates to mutagenicity negative except intermediate f from the calculated results the degradation process can alleviate the toxicity of dcf but most of the intermediates are still toxic therefore although complete removal of dcf can be obtained within 50 min the degradation duration should be extended to at least 90 min to obtain better mineralization 3 5 reusability fig 9 shows removal of dcf by cnc2 over five reuse cycle cnc2 exhibites excellent reusability and the removal efficiency of dcf maintaines over 90 even in the fifth cycle therefore cnc2 holding good photo stability is a promising material for practical applications 4 conclusions carbon quantum dots cqds modified porous graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 is successfully synthesized via a facile polymerized method cqds are evenly decorated onto the surface of g c3n4 without altering the skeletal structure of g c3n4 cqds modification greatly enhances the photocatalytic activity of g c3n4 while excess amount of cqds block the light adsorption therefore cnc2 exhibits the best photocatalytic performance which exceeds 15 times higher than pure g c3n4 based on the first order rate constant k 1 for dcf degradation the degradation mechanism is found to be a o2 dominated photosensitation like process the presence of cqds broadens the absorption spectrum of g c3n4 and act as charge carriers for photo generated electrons e resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity of cncs in addition higher ph contributes to dcf removal through decreasing the conduction band potential which promotes the generation of o2 the active atoms with high fukui index interpret the ring hydroxylation photocyclization and c n bond cleavage under the attack of reactive radicals the toxicity of dcf is alleviated during the degradation process according to the calculation by quantitative structure activity relationship qsar prediction the as prepared photocatalysts show excellent photo stability during recycle experiments the study provides a class of promising materials for efficient removal of emerging contaminants from wastewaters conflicts of

19051,phosphate po4 3 p and nitrate no3 n in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants are the predominant sources of eutrophication in this study a bench scale electrochemically assisted vertical flow constructed wetland e vfcw was developed which exhibited favorable po4 3 p 89 7 99 4 no3 n 82 7 99 6 and tn 51 9 93 7 removal efficiency in tertiary wastewater treatment in addition little n2o accumulation 0 32 2 19 of no3 n was observed the study further elucidated that po4 3 p was removed mainly in the anode chamber by co precipitation fe n oh po4 and adsorption feooh po4 pathways multi pathway of no3 n reduction was proposed with 13 9 30 2 of no3 n predominantly eliminated in the anode chamber by ferrous dependent no3 n reduction bacteria in the cathode chamber electrons storage and resupply modes during s cycle exerted crucial roles in no3 n reduction which enhanced the resilience capabilities of the e vfcw to shock loadings stoichiometric analysis revealed that 3 3 6 6 mmol e cycle were stored in the form of s0 fes and fes2 in the e vfcw under longer hrt or higher current density however the deposited s resupplied 19 6 and 28 3 of electrons for no3 n reduction under shorter hrt 1 h or lower current density 0 01 ma cm 2 moreover ferrous driven no3 n reducing or dnra bacteria also promoted no3 n elimination in the cathode chamber these findings provide new insight into the coupling interactions among s fe and h cycles as well as n and p transformations in electrochemically assisted no3 n reduction systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords tertiary wastewater treatment constructed wetlands electrochemical systems autotrophic denitrification sulfur cycle electrons distribution 1 introduction eutrophication has been widely recognized as the primary problem of surface waters schindler et al 2016 typical symptoms of eutrophication include dense algal bloom and increasing anoxia and toxins secretion e g microcystin producing derogatory effects on aquatic organisms and humans schindler et al 2008 smith and schindler 2009 excessive anthropogenic nutrients inputs originating from wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been reported to be the predominant sources of eutrophication for instance discharge from wwtps in netherlands contributes to 34 phosphorous p load and 14 nitrogen n load annually hendriks and langeveld 2017 therefore there is an urgent need to develop methods to effectively reduce nutrients inputs from wwtps for aquatic ecosystem recovery constructed wetlands cws have been extensively utilized as an eco buffer basin to treat wwtps effluent owing to their eco friendliness economic benefits and simple operations chen et al 2016 he et al 2018 however elimination of p from wwtps effluent within cws primarily includes sluggish plants assimilation and substrates absorption in addition lack of available carbon sources in wwtps effluent makes it difficult to drive significant microbial denitrification process within cws therefore a large area of land per unit wastewater is usually required for wwtps effluent treatment by conventional cws to meet the stringent discharge standards paranychianakis et al 2016 although carbon dosing strategy can be employed to enhance denitrification it hasn t been emerged as panacea for electrons donor shortage due to its inherent diseconomy moreover as the stability of carbon supply does not coincide with periodic and random variations in the no3 n level excessive carbon or nitrite no2 n accumulations could constrain the denitrification potential of cws metcalf and eddy 2014 electrochemical systems have potential prospects for the enhancement of nutrients removal and recovery in cws kelly and he 2014 nancharaiah et al 2016 recent studies have integrated iron fe anode into horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands hfcws to intensify simultaneous p and n elimination gao et al 2017 2018 furthermore electro coagulation has been demonstrated to be feasible and economical for favorable p removal within 5 20 min bektas et al 2004 tian et al 2018 it must be noted that in situ electrolytic ferrous ion fe2 possesses a higher thermodynamic potential for p coagulation than hydrated fe2 electrochemical systems have been recognized as efficient alternatives for no3 n removal enhancement xu et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 with autohydrogenotrophic denitrifying bacteria utilizing in situ electrolytic hydrogen h2 as electron donor when compared with heterotrophic denitrification autohydrogenotrophic denitrification produces lower sludge yield which could alleviate clogging in cws integrated electrolysis in cws does not require chemical regents spiking thus simplifying the tertiary treatment process for regulation and automation however autohydrogenotrophic denitrification has been demonstrated to be constrained by the low solubility of h2 1 7 ppm 28 c 1 atm allowing low mass transfer and electrons utilization rates rezania et al 2007 sulfur s cycle has been observed to possess potential to regulate electrons storage and resupply during denitrification in cws chen et al 2014 sulfate so4 2 s is a common constituent of wwtps effluent and the so4 2 s concentration in wwtps effluent in shanghai china is 48 2 9 8 mg l 1 with average s n so4 2 s no3 n ratio of 6 18 chen et al 2014 moreover the so4 2 s concentration and s n ratio in several wwtps effluent in southwest china were around 50 90 mg l 1 and 3 5 respectively based on our previous investigation sulfate reducing bacteria srb have been noted to exhibit higher affinity to h2 than denitrifying bacteria db with higher s n ratio thus so4 2 s reduction preferentially occurs with electron donors derived from h2 and in situ biogenic sulfur s0 and metallic sulfide e g fes get deposited on the carrier matrix in cws solid phase s is speculated to resupply electrons continuously owing to their long solid retention time srt in cws which might contribute to favorable electrons utilization by db sierra alvarez et al 2007 wu et al 2013 moreover covering polymers might cause the micron scale biogenic s and metallic sulfide particles to become hydrophilic sierra alvarez et al 2007 wiessner et al 2010 which might provide more binding sites for db thus favoring s driven denitrification dynamics besides the anodic fe2 co precipitation with biogenic s2 could relieve metallic release gao et al 2017 and rotten egg odor of hydrogen sulfide h2s emission wu et al 2013 nevertheless to the best of the authors knowledge only a few studies have investigated the roles of s cycle in electrons transfer and nutrients removal in electrochemically assisted cws therefore there is an urgent need to elucidate the underlying coupling mechanisms of p n s fe and h2 transformations in electrochemically assisted cws nitrous oxide n2o is recognized as the predominant greenhouse gas with 296 fold higher global warming potential gwp than carbon dioxide su et al 2018 wuebbles 2009 it has been reported that denitrification in wwtps is a significant source of anthropogenic n2o emission li et al 2017 however previous studies on electrolysis integrated cws did not focus on n2o accumulation during autotrophic denitrification process thus constraining the comprehensive environmental evaluation of electrochemically assisted cws accordingly in the present study an electrochemically assisted vertical flow constructed wetland e vfcw was developed for tertiary treatment of wwtps effluent the aims of this study were to 1 evaluate the removal effectiveness and potential transformation pathways of p and n 2 elucidate the key role of s cycle in n transformations 3 assess gwp by n2o accumulation determination and 4 characterize the microbial consortia involved in n fe and s cycles in the e vfcw the results of this study shed new lights on the combined interactions of nutrients migration and electrons distribution in electrochemically assisted ecosystems 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental reactors the bench scale vfcws combined with electrolysis devices are shown in fig 1 each vfcw was manufactured with polyvinyl chloride pvc column with a height of 500 mm and an internal diameter of 200 mm lightweight coconut fiber packing was selected as a favorable alternative to gravel when compared with gravel coconut fiber packing exhibited larger porosity better biocompatibility and lower weight table s1 which could enhance mass transfer and economic benefits of cws the e vfcw was operated in a closed circuit mode with dc regulated power supply korad ka6002p china the anode chamber was filled with waste fe scraps diameter of 2 3 mm height of 5 cm the cathode chamber consisted of three perforated stainless steel plates with diameter of 18 cm the pores of the plates allowed liquid transflux with diameter and center distance of 5 and 7 mm respectively the electrodes were arranged at distances of 10 cm the anode and cathode chambers were separated by glass wool the control group c vfcw operated in a non electric mode the experiments were conducted in a thermostatic room at 28 1 c 2 2 wastewater and experimental procedure synthetic wastewater was prepared based on the effluent quality of a wwtp in chongqing china n 29 28 e 106 28 without considering chemical p precipitation treatment the synthetic wastewater contained approximately 16 mg l 1 of no3 n 2 mg l 1 po4 3 p 0 5 mg l 1 of nh4 n 75 mg l 1 of so4 2 s and 30 mg l 1 of cod with s n ratio of 4 69 the cod was stimulated with cellulose which presented notably poor biodegradation trace elements dosing was accomplished as described in a previous literature wang et al 2018a the ph do and orp of synthetic wastewater were maintained at 7 23 0 24 2 91 0 32 mg l

vfcws were fed with the synthetic wastewater and operated in batch mode with a cycle time of 12 h a current density of 0 05 ma cm 2 in cathodic area was constantly applied for 30 cycles to acclimatize autohydrogenotrophic bacteria after the acclimatizing period the e vfcw was subsequently operated in a continuous down flow mode by peristaltic pump jihpump 253yx china the effects of hydraulic retention time hrt and current density on e vfcw effectiveness were investigated initially the e vfcw was operated under a current density of 0 05 ma cm 1 and hrt of 12 9 6 3 and 1 h respectively subsequently the current density was varied between 0 01 and 0 10 ma cm 1 at hrt of 3 h the e vfcw was operated for 15 days for each phase the operational conditions are presented in detail in table 1

using a uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr5000 usa apha 2012 the ph do and orp were measured with a portable multi parameter analyzer hach hq30d usa furthermore to investigate the coupling interactions between n transformation and s cycle along the longitudinal direction of the e vfcw liquor samples were collected from all the sampling ports adjacent to the electrodes of the e vfcw fig 1 at phases 2 5 6 and 7 2 3 2 determination of n2o accumulation the headspace equilibrium technique was used to determine the dissolved n2o in the effluent liu et al 2015 in brief approximately 10 ml of n2 99 999 were injected into the headspace bottle to displace the liquor sample subsequently the bottle was shaken vigorously for 30 min at 25 c the headspace n2o was measured by gc ecd shimadzu gc 14c japan and the dissolved n2o concentration was calculated based on the degree of saturation relative to the n2o content in air 2 3 3 identification of solid phase fe p and s for solid phase fe p and s

denitrification to further reveal the role of solid phase s deposit in denitrification in vitro batch experiment was performed briefly 100 g of coconut fiber packing were collected from the cathode chamber and gently washed thrice with ultra pure water subsequently synthetic wastewater 100 mg l 1 of no3 n 2 mg l 1 of po4 3 p and 200 mg l 1 of hco3 was spiked into a 500 ml bottle containing the pretreated packing the bottle was incubated at 28 1 c in a shaking incubator with a rotation speed of 135 r min 1 liquor samples were collected at regular intervals and no3 n no2 n nh4 n s2o3 2 s and so4 2 s contents were determined the stoichiometric calculations of so4 2 s formation are presented in detail in supporting information 2 5 microbial examination the sludge samples were collected from the anode and upper middle and bottom parts of the cathode chambers of the e vfcw in phase 4 and termed as e a e c1 e c2 and e c3 respectively the inoculated sludge sample was denoted in the samples were cryopreserved at 40 c until further molecular biological tests genomic dna extraction from the sludge samples was performed through three freeze thaw cycles followed by a lysis process at 65 c wang et al 2018a the extracted dna was quantified spectrophotometrically and its quality was verified on an ethidium agarose gel rt pcr was performed using stepone plus system applied biosystems usa

retrieved based on similarity and clustered by using silva databases https www arb silva de 3 results and discussion 3 1 p elimination pathways p has been reported to be one of the key nutrients that limits productivity in waterbody abell et al 2010 and p limitation control strategy has been increasingly applied to halt the eutrophication process sterner 2008 thus there is an urgent need to further reduce p discharge loads from wwtps in the present study electro coagulation with sacrificial fe anode exhibited enhanced p elimination as shown in table 1 and fig s1a p removal mainly occurred in the anode chamber accounting for 92 8 99 4 of the po4 3 p elimination within the e vfcw in addition p was further removed in the cathode chamber table 1 the p removal effectiveness correlated with hrt and current density table 1 when the hrt declined from 12 to 3 h po4 3 p in the effluent increased from 0 044 0 012 to 0 066 0 014 mg l 1 in addition when the current density decreased to 0 01 ma cm 2 po4 3 p in the effluent further increased to 0 159 0 031 mg l 1 table 1 optimal p removal effectiveness was achieved under hrt and current density of 3 h and 0 10 ma cm 2 respectively with 0 025 0 010 mg l 1 residual po4 3 p in the effluent table 1 it must be noted that the ph elevation in both the anode and cathode favored p elimination fig s2 bektas et al 2004 in the cvfcw the p removal rates decreased from 8 5 4 9 to 0 8 3 9 when the hrt declined from 12 to 1 h in addition pseudo first order model indicated that the negligible p adsorption capacity of coconut fiber 0 0096 mg g 1 did not contribute to the significant p elimination thus plant assimilation and substrates absorption in cws were less than satisfactory for advanced p removal under low hrt conditions to reveal the underlying p elimination pathways in the e vfcw the deposited particles in the anode and cathode chambers were analyzed by using xrd and xps as shown in fig 2 a a small xrd peak denoting fem po4 n crystalline minerals was detected for the anode chamber indicating that negligible amount of fe2 or fe3 directly contributed to p precipitation the binding energy at the xps peak position of fe2p3 2 of the pulverized particles in the anode chamber was about 711 3 ev coinciding with the feooh 711 5 ev and fe2o3 710 7 711 2 ev patterns moreover the xps peak position of p2p coincided with kh2po4 133 5 ev these results revealed that p removal in the anode chamber was achieved through co precipitation fe n oh po4 and adsorption feooh po4 table s3 the sem images suggested that the submicron particles deposited on the anode surface fig s3a effectively enhanced the mass transfer rate for p elimination almeida et al 2010 kim et al 2011 the xrd and xps analyses of the cathode chamber suggested that p might have been deposited on the packing matrix in forms of fepo4 2h2o crystalline minerals and feooh po4 table s3 3 2 sulfate reduction relieved fe release residual fe release up to about 30 mg l 1 has been reported to be an inherent drawback of electrolysis integrated cws with an fe anode gao et al 2017 posing potential toxicity to aquatic organisms however the findings of the present study could provide perspective for reducing fe release in e vfcw with fe anode in phase 1 the released fe content in the anode and cathode chambers was 9 76 1 97 and 0 67 0 55 mg l 1 respectively fig 3 a indicating that cathode chamber could serve as an eco buffer basin for the removal of the electrolytic fe it must be noted that the removal of total fe could alleviate the biological inhibitory effect on denitrifying microorganisms wang et al 2018b however in the present study fe variations presented the opposite trend under shorter hrt phase 5 or lower current density phase 7 fig 3a interestingly changes in the fe content correlated with the so4 2 s variations trend in the cathode chamber fig 3 therefore it was speculated that the s cycle might exert a significant role in the removal or release of fe in cathode chamber moreover srb e g desulfovibrio enrichment was observed in the cathode chamber fig 7 c and so4 2 s reduction to sulfide in the cathode chamber might result in significant fe precipitation van der welle et al 2007 the xrd and xps peak positions of s2p3 2 160 9 ev and s2p1 2 162 7 ev confirmed in situ fes and fes2 formation table s3 besides s2 precipitation in e vfcw could also alleviate h2s emission however during inadequate electrons supply fe and so4 2 s release was observed in the cathode chamber fig 3 which might be ascribed to the electrons resupply by fes and fes2 to drive no3 n reduction process except for the co precipitation of fe and s the oxidation of fe2 β feooh and precipitation with po4 3 p fepo4 2h2o in the cathode chamber might also contribute to the reduction of fe release fig 2d 3 3 coupling mechanisms of s cycle and n elimination elimination of no3 n has been increasingly addressed owing to its negative health effects bergquist et al 2016 although p limitation control strategy has been observed to improves water quality in several aquatic ecosystems broader environmental goals have not been achieved especially in coastal marine and estuaries conley et al 2009 leading to widespread recognition to control n inputs in the present study multi pathway of no3 n reduction was proposed the no3 n elimination predominantly occurred in the cathode chamber table 2 whereas 13 9 30 2 of no3 n removal was observed fig s4a in the anode chamber furthermore prolonged hrt tended to enhance no3 n removal effectiveness when the hrt was decreased from 12 to 3 h and further to 1 h the residual no3 n content in the effluent was 0 35 0 20 0 74 0 28 and 2 10 0 31 mg l 1 respectively table 2 moreover lower current density 0 05 ma cm 2 notably decreased no3 n removal rate p 0 001 whereas higher current density 0 05 ma cm 2 exerted negligible effects on denitrification in the cathode chamber p 0 683 table 2 table 2 shows that small amount of no2 n accumulated in the cathode chamber except under hrt of 1 h 0 25 0 18 mg l 1 or current density of 0 01 ma cm 2 0 34 0 26 mg l 1 however it is worth noting that the byproduct of nh4 n accumulation in the cathode chamber could impede the discharged effluent s quality to satisfied the stringent standards e g environmental quality standards for surface water in china in phase 1 4 37 2 11 mg l 1 of nh4 n was discharged from the e vfcw table 2 and it was speculated that the nh4 n accumulation might be ascribed to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra process using femsn s0 fe or fe2 as electrons donors interestingly nh4 n release could be effectively alleviated by hrt regulation under hrt of 12 h the nh4 n accumulation rate reached 24 6 13 0 whereas it dropped to 4 7 3 5 under hrt of 3 h fig s4 this response is similar to those reported in previous studies which suggested that higher fe n or s n ratio favored dnra process dolejs et al 2015 wang et al 2015 in the present study the optimal hrt and current density were noted to be 3 h and 0 05 ma cm 2 for tn elimination respectively with 1 10 0 54 mg l 1 nh4 n 0 10 0 08 mg l 1 no2 n 0 74 0 28 mg l 1 no3 n and 1 94 0 55 mg l 1 tn in the effluent of e vfcw table 2 to investigate the underlying coupling interactions between s cycle and no3 n elimination in e vfcw phases 2 5 6 and 7 were chosen as the typical operation modes to examine the effects of electrons storage and resupply modes on n and s transformations along the longitudinal direction of the e vfcw as shown in fig 4a no3 n elimination and nh4 n accumulation predominantly occurred in the upper cathode chamber in phase 2 with longer hrt in addition so4 2 s removal occurred throughout the cathode chambers in phase 2 table s4 in phase 6 the so4 2 s content increased while the no3 n concentration decreased in the bottom cathode chamber fig 4c demonstrating that electrons resupply by deposited s might accelerate denitrification or dnra processes with shorter hrt although powered by higher current density similar trends were also observed for the n and s transformations in phase 5 shorter hrt and phase 7 lower current density fig 4 in detail so4 2 s and nh4 n contents tended to increase along the longitudinal direction of the cathode chamber while no3 n concentration exhibited the opposite trend this result revealed that the deposited s on the matrix of e vfcws might exert a crucial role in electrons resupply during electrons supply demand disequilibrium occurred besides negligible amount of s2 or s2o3 2 s was detected in all the liquor samples in the cathode chamber the deposition s0 fes and fes2 fig 2 and enrichment of s oxidizing bacteria e g thiobacillus fig 7c suggested the possible occurrence of s driven autotrophic no3 n reduction to validate this hypothesis batch test for no3 n reduction was performed without organic carbon or h2 supply as shown in fig 5 rapid no3 n elimination was observed in the initial 24 h notable quantity of no2 n accumulated reaching 22 0 mg l 1 in the initial 20 h and then decreased to 3 1 mg l 1 at 36 h dnra accounted for approximately 13 0 of no3 n removal with 13 1 mg l 1 nh4 n accumulation fig 5 furthermore as the trend of generation was similar to the theoretical so4 2 s formation fig 5 s driven autotrophic denitrification or dnra could have occurred in the cathode chamber however so4 2 s production was lower than the theoretical so4 2 s formation indicating that reduced s i e s0 fes and fes2 did not serve as the sole electron donor for no3 n reduction nevertheless considering that the migration of some granulated waste fe scraps in the anode chamber to the cathode chamber and enrichment of fe oxidizing bacteria e g unclassified gallionellaceae it can be speculated that fe might contribute to autotrophic denitrification or dnra process in the cathode chamber these results demonstrated that no3 n removal was not solely accomplished by h2 driven denitrification because fe oxidation s cycle and dnra complicated the denitrogenation pathways the multi pathway of n transformations proposed in the present study could enhance no3 n removal when compared with those reported in previous studies gao et al 2017 xu et al 2017 on the one hand granulated waste fe scraps exerted a crucial role in electrons supply it has been reported that zvi packed bed is an alternative for rapid no3 n reduction fu et al 2014 and that the electrolytic fe2 favored electrons transfer on zvi surface accelerating autotrophic denitrification rate xu et al 2012 on the other hand s cycle contributed to electrons storage and resupply for no3 n reduction the reduced s0 fes and fes2 on the carrier matrix in cws exhibited longer srt which was speculated to persistently resupply electrons for denitrification the electrons storage and resupply modes during s cycle could shed new lights on relieving the inherent drawback of low transfer rate of no3 n reduction owing to insolubility of h2 besides sem images showed that the micron scale solid particles could provide more binding sites for db favoring s driven denitrification dynamics fig s3b c these results are consistent with a previous study that s cycle could enhance the electron utilization rate during no3 n reduction wang et al 2009 quantification of electrons storage and resupply during s cycle and no3 n removal was performed based on stoichiometric calculations as shown in table 3 hrt and current density exerted significant impacts on electrons transfers and distributions in phase 1 longer hrt and phase 6 higher current density 6 3 1 0 and 3 5 0 6 mmol e cycle were stored in the form of s0 fes and fes2 respectively table 3 when hrt or current density declined no3 n reduction was partly supported by the reserved electrons in phase 5 shorter hrt and phase 7 lower current density 1 0 0 7 and 1 5 0 3 mmol e cycle derived from solid s were resupplied for denitrification or dnra process providing an average of 19 6 and 28 3 electrons for no3 n reduction respectively table 3 as a result e vfcws presented brilliant resilience capabilities to shock loadings owing to the electrons storage and resupply modes of s cycle so4 2 s is a less thermodynamically favorable electrons acceptor than no3 n ontiveros valencia et al 2012 therefore it was hypothesized that so4 2 s reduction rates will decrease with the s n ratios as electrons storage and resupply modes of s cycle are significant in no3 n removal a relatively high s n ratio might be required accordingly the results of the present study could contribute to enhanced nutrients removal from the wwtps effluent with higher s n ratios such as sulfate rich domestic wastewater co treatment of domestic wastewater and industry wastewater enriched with so4 2 s e g landfill leachate mustard and glutamate wastewater 3 4 n2o accumulation to the best of the authors knowledge assessment of potential n2o accumulation within electrolysis integrated cws has not been reported yet in the present study n2o accumulation in liquor samples were notably low 59 3 μg l 1 n2on at hrt within the range of 12 9 h corresponding to only 0 38 of no3 n in e vfcw fig 6 however the n2o accumulation rate slightly increased with the decline in hrt moreover current density exerted a significant role on n2o accumulation in phase 7 314 3 17 4 μg l 1 of dissolved n2on accumulation was noted which corresponded to 2 19 0 12 of the no3 n in e vfcw fig 6 this phenomenon could be ascribed to the limitation of electrons equivalents supply and production for the complete denitrification with decreasing hrt or current density lu and chandran 2010 besides the gaseous phase n2o emission flux to atmosphere was negligible previous studies have reported that 20 30 of initial n in heterotrophic denitrification systems was emitted as n2o when the c n ratio was lower than 3 5 itokawa et al 2001 in the present study n2o accumulation and emission flux in electrochemically assisted bioreactors could be decreased by 95 3 98 5 except phase 7 when compared with those in heterotrophic denitrification systems thus application of e vfcw could emerged as panacea for n2o emission reduction when treating wastewater with low c n ratio 3 5 insight into microbial consortia the rarefaction curve exhibited clear asymptote fig s5a indicating a near complete sequencing of microbial communities the otu number chao and ace valves for the cathode chamber significantly increased when compared with those for the inoculum and anode chamber p 0 05 demonstrating that the electrolytic h2 might stimulate microbial community richness table s5 besides shannon and simpson indices established that the cathode chamber achieved the highest microbial community diversity table s5 which might be owing to the complicated pathways in the cathode chamber including n transfer s cycle and fe oxidation venn diagram showed that the shared otus of all the samples were 65 accounting for merely 3 6 of the total outs fig s5c this finding indicated the presence of distinct differences among the microbial communities in the inoculum anode chamber and cathode chamber however the shared otus along the longitudinal direction of the cathode chambers were 663 accounting for 44 5 of the total otus fig s5d implying that microbial communities in the cathode chambers had relatively higher similarity these findings were further confirmed by principle component analysis pca at the otu level fig s5b rt pcr was performed to compare the copy numbers of nirs nirk and nosz genes targeting db along the longitudinal direction of e vfcw fig 7a shows that the copy numbers of the denitrification genes in the cathode chamber were much higher than those in the anode chamber which corresponded to higher no3 n elimination in the cathode chamber this phenomenon could probably be owing to the excellent surface properties of coconut fiber packing table s1 and in situ h2 supply in the cathode chamber the abundances of nitrite reductase genes σnirs nirk along the longitudinal direction of the cathode chamber were 7 01 8 19 and 1 47 106 copies g 1 packing respectively fig 7a the notably lower abundances of the denitrification groups at the bottom layer of the e vfcws might be owing to the decrease in h2 and no3 n concentrations allowing lower mass transfer rates for denitrification in addition nosz genes were comparable to nitrite reductase genes which favored less n2o accumulation and emission in the e vfcw to gain further microbiological insights into the coupling interactions of no3 n reduction s cycle and fe oxidation 16s rrna sequencing was performed as shown in fig 7b firmicutes 74 7 was the predominant phylum in the inoculated sludge however proteobacteria notably increased after long term exposure to electric field accounting for 2 8 73 5 39 8 39 9 and 51 2 in in e a e c1 e c2 and e c3 respectively as proteobacteria has been reported to be the predominant denitrifying phylum chen et al 2018 it can be concluded that e vfcw might favor enrichment of autotrophic denitrifying bacterial consortia in the anode chamber the genera unclassified gallionellaceae 22 9 and dechloromonas 13 5 were the most abundant microbes which are associated with ferrous driven no3 n reduction chakraborty and picardal 2013 he et al 2016 the synergistic interaction between unclassified gallionellaceae and dechloromonas were estimated to fulfil 13 9 30 2 of no3 n elimination in the anodic zvi bed fig s4a in addition geothrix might contribute to the dissimilatory ferric reduction with escaped h2 from the cathode nevin and lovley 2002 which could accelerate ferrous driven no3 n reduction process with regenerated ferrous in the cathode chamber autohydrogenotrophic db were assumed to exert crucial roles in no3 n elimination chen et al 2015 gao et al 2017 however no strains of the major autohydrogenotrophic denitrifying bacteria namely hydrogenophaga ochrobactrum paracoccus pseudomonas and thauera chen et al 2015 were detected in the cathode chamber indicating that electrolytic h2 might not directly serve as electron donor for no3 n reduction nevertheless the detected microbial communities indicated that electrolytic h2 exerted a crucial role in the coupling interactions between no3 n reduction and s and fe cycles fig 7c for coupling interactions between s cycle and n transformation microbial consortia comprising desulfobulbus desulfomicrobium desulfovibrio desulfuromonas and unclassified desulfuromonadales preferentially fulfilled so4 2 s reduction with h2 castro et al 2000 and subsequently electrons resupply by deposited s promoted no3 n reduction process by s driven no3 n reduction bacteria thiobacillus and limnobacter moon et al 2004 spring et al 2001 the abundances of bacteria involved in n transformations and s cycle are summarized in table s6 fe oxidizing bacterial genera unclassified gallionellaceae and ferritrophicum were also detected in the cathode chamber weiss et al 2007 indicating fe2 and waste fe scraps might contribute to no3 n elimination in the cathode chamber it must be noted that members of the genus clostridium have been identified as dnra bacteria pett ridge and firestone 2005 yin et al 2002 in the present study clostridium sensu stricto 1 exhibited 10 3 5 0 and 3 1 abundance in the upper middle and bottom parts of the cathode chamber respectively fig 7c contributing to significant nh4 n accumulation in the cathode chamber fig s4b it is worth noting that genus clostridium sensu stricto 1 was the predominant microorganisms in the inoculum sludge 34 8 it has been reported that clostridium sensu stricto 1 was the dominant contributor to no3 n reduction in electrochemically assisted cws when inoculated with anaerobic sludge xu et al 2017 therefore anaerobic sludge might not be an appropriate alternative inoculum for minimizing nh4 n accumulation 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that e vfcw favored po4 3 p and no3 n removal for tertiary treatment of wwtps effluent the po4 3 p and no3 n removal rates tended to decrease with hrt or current density po4 3 p was predominantly removed in the sacrificial iron anode chamber by co precipitation and adsorption dnra and s and fe dependent denitrification processes synergistically occurred to drive no3 n transformation in particular the electrons storage and resupply in the s cycle exerted a crucial role in ensuring stable no3 n reduction in e vfcw stoichiometric calculations demonstrated that 3 3 6 6 mmol e cycle were stored in the form of s0 fes and fes2 in e vfcw under longer hrt or higher current density in contrast the deposited s resupplied 19 6 28 3 electrons for no3 n reduction under shorter hrt or lower current density in conclusion this study provides new insights into the associations between nutrients

19051,phosphate po4 3 p and nitrate no3 n in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants are the predominant sources of eutrophication in this study a bench scale electrochemically assisted vertical flow constructed wetland e vfcw was developed which exhibited favorable po4 3 p 89 7 99 4 no3 n 82 7 99 6 and tn 51 9 93 7 removal efficiency in tertiary wastewater treatment in addition little n2o accumulation 0 32 2 19 of no3 n was observed the study further elucidated that po4 3 p was removed mainly in the anode chamber by co precipitation fe n oh po4 and adsorption feooh po4 pathways multi pathway of no3 n reduction was proposed with 13 9 30 2 of no3 n predominantly eliminated in the anode chamber by ferrous dependent no3 n reduction bacteria in the cathode chamber electrons storage and resupply modes during s cycle exerted crucial roles in no3 n reduction which enhanced the resilience capabilities of the e vfcw to shock loadings stoichiometric analysis revealed that 3 3 6 6 mmol e cycle were stored in the form of s0 fes and fes2 in the e vfcw under longer hrt or higher current density however the deposited s resupplied 19 6 and 28 3 of electrons for no3 n reduction under shorter hrt 1 h or lower current density 0 01 ma cm 2 moreover ferrous driven no3 n reducing or dnra bacteria also promoted no3 n elimination in the cathode chamber these findings provide new insight into the coupling interactions among s fe and h cycles as well as n and p transformations in electrochemically assisted no3 n reduction systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords tertiary wastewater treatment constructed wetlands electrochemical systems autotrophic denitrification sulfur cycle electrons distribution 1 introduction eutrophication has been widely recognized as the primary problem of surface waters schindler et al 2016 typical symptoms of eutrophication include dense algal bloom and increasing anoxia and toxins secretion e g microcystin producing derogatory effects on aquatic organisms and humans schindler et al 2008 smith and schindler 2009 excessive anthropogenic nutrients inputs originating from wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been reported to be the predominant sources of eutrophication for instance discharge from wwtps in netherlands contributes to 34 phosphorous p load and 14 nitrogen n load annually hendriks and langeveld 2017 therefore there is an urgent need to develop methods to effectively reduce nutrients inputs from wwtps for aquatic ecosystem recovery constructed wetlands cws have been extensively utilized as an eco buffer basin to treat wwtps effluent owing to their eco friendliness economic benefits and simple operations chen et al 2016 he et al 2018 however elimination of p from wwtps effluent within cws primarily includes sluggish plants assimilation and substrates absorption in addition lack of available carbon sources in wwtps effluent makes it difficult to drive significant microbial denitrification process within cws therefore a large area of land per unit wastewater is usually required for wwtps effluent treatment by conventional cws to meet the stringent discharge standards paranychianakis et al 2016 although carbon dosing strategy can be employed to enhance denitrification it hasn t been emerged as panacea for electrons donor shortage due to its inherent diseconomy moreover as the stability of carbon supply does not coincide with periodic and random variations in the no3 n level excessive carbon or nitrite no2 n accumulations could constrain the denitrification potential of cws metcalf and eddy 2014 electrochemical systems have potential prospects for the enhancement of nutrients removal and recovery in cws kelly and he 2014 nancharaiah et al 2016 recent studies have integrated iron fe anode into horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands hfcws to intensify simultaneous p and n elimination gao et al 2017 2018 furthermore electro coagulation has been demonstrated to be feasible and economical for favorable p removal within 5 20 min bektas et al 2004 tian et al 2018 it must be noted that in situ electrolytic ferrous ion fe2 possesses a higher thermodynamic potential for p coagulation than hydrated fe2 electrochemical systems have been recognized as efficient alternatives for no3 n removal enhancement xu et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 with autohydrogenotrophic denitrifying bacteria utilizing in situ electrolytic hydrogen h2 as electron donor when compared with heterotrophic denitrification autohydrogenotrophic denitrification produces lower sludge yield which could alleviate clogging in cws integrated electrolysis in cws does not require chemical regents spiking thus simplifying the tertiary treatment process for regulation and automation however autohydrogenotrophic denitrification has been demonstrated to be constrained by the low solubility of h2 1 7 ppm 28 c 1 atm allowing low mass transfer and electrons utilization rates rezania et al 2007 sulfur s cycle has been observed to possess potential to regulate electrons storage and resupply during denitrification in cws chen et al 2014 sulfate so4 2 s is a common constituent of wwtps effluent and the so4 2 s concentration in wwtps effluent in shanghai china is 48 2 9 8 mg l 1 with average s n so4 2 s no3 n ratio of 6 18 chen et al 2014 moreover the so4 2 s concentration and s n ratio in several wwtps effluent in southwest china were around 50 90 mg l 1 and 3 5 respectively based on our previous investigation sulfate reducing bacteria srb have been noted to exhibit higher affinity to h2 than denitrifying bacteria db with higher s n ratio thus so4 2 s reduction preferentially occurs with electron donors derived from h2 and in situ biogenic sulfur s0 and metallic sulfide e g fes get deposited on the carrier matrix in cws solid phase s is speculated to resupply electrons continuously owing to their long solid retention time srt in cws which might contribute to favorable electrons utilization by db sierra alvarez et al 2007 wu et al 2013 moreover covering polymers might cause the micron scale biogenic s and metallic sulfide particles to become hydrophilic sierra alvarez et al 2007 wiessner et al 2010 which might provide more binding sites for db thus favoring s driven denitrification dynamics besides the anodic fe2 co precipitation with biogenic s2 could relieve metallic release gao et al 2017 and rotten egg odor of hydrogen sulfide h2s emission wu et al 2013 nevertheless to the best of the authors knowledge only a few studies have investigated the roles of s cycle in electrons transfer and nutrients removal in electrochemically assisted cws therefore there is an urgent need to elucidate the underlying coupling mechanisms of p n s fe and h2 transformations in electrochemically assisted cws nitrous oxide n2o is recognized as the predominant greenhouse gas with 296 fold higher global warming potential gwp than carbon dioxide su et al 2018 wuebbles 2009 it has been reported that denitrification in wwtps is a significant source of anthropogenic n2o emission li et al 2017 however previous studies on electrolysis integrated cws did not focus on n2o accumulation during autotrophic denitrification process thus constraining the comprehensive environmental evaluation of electrochemically assisted cws accordingly in the present study an electrochemically assisted vertical flow constructed wetland e vfcw was developed for tertiary treatment of wwtps effluent the aims of this study were to 1 evaluate the removal effectiveness and potential transformation pathways of p and n 2 elucidate the key role of s cycle in n transformations 3 assess gwp by n2o accumulation determination and 4 characterize the microbial consortia involved in n fe and s cycles in the e vfcw the results of this study shed new lights on the combined interactions of nutrients migration and electrons distribution in electrochemically assisted ecosystems 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental reactors the bench scale vfcws combined with electrolysis devices are shown in fig 1 each vfcw was manufactured with polyvinyl chloride pvc column with a height of 500 mm and an internal diameter of 200 mm lightweight coconut fiber packing was selected as a favorable alternative to gravel when compared with gravel coconut fiber packing exhibited larger porosity better biocompatibility and lower weight table s1 which could enhance mass transfer and economic benefits of cws the e vfcw was operated in a closed circuit mode with dc regulated power supply korad ka6002p china the anode chamber was filled with waste fe scraps diameter of 2 3 mm height of 5 cm the cathode chamber consisted of three perforated stainless steel plates with diameter of 18 cm the pores of the plates allowed liquid transflux with diameter and center distance of 5 and 7 mm respectively the electrodes were arranged at distances of 10 cm the anode and cathode chambers were separated by glass wool the control group c vfcw operated in a non electric mode the experiments were conducted in a thermostatic room at 28 1 c 2 2 wastewater and experimental procedure synthetic wastewater was prepared based on the effluent quality of a wwtp in chongqing china n 29 28 e 106 28 without considering chemical p precipitation treatment the synthetic wastewater contained approximately 16 mg l 1 of no3 n 2 mg l 1 po4 3 p 0 5 mg l 1 of nh4 n 75 mg l 1 of so4 2 s and 30 mg l 1 of cod with s n ratio of 4 69 the cod was stimulated with cellulose which presented notably poor biodegradation trace elements dosing was accomplished as described in a previous literature wang et al 2018a the ph do and orp of synthetic wastewater were maintained at 7 23 0 24 2 91 0 32 mg l 1 and 196 6 25 6 mv respectively to facilitate biofilm formation the vfcws were inoculated with anaerobic sludge 1000 mg biomass l 1 collected from a swine wwtp in chongqing china n 30 2 e 106 13 the vfcws were fed with the synthetic wastewater and operated in batch mode with a cycle time of 12 h a current density of 0 05 ma cm 2 in cathodic area was constantly applied for 30 cycles to acclimatize autohydrogenotrophic bacteria after the acclimatizing period the e vfcw was subsequently operated in a continuous down flow mode by peristaltic pump jihpump 253yx china the effects of hydraulic retention time hrt and current density on e vfcw effectiveness were investigated initially the e vfcw was operated under a current density of 0 05 ma cm 1 and hrt of 12 9 6 3 and 1 h respectively subsequently the current density was varied between 0 01 and 0 10 ma cm 1 at hrt of 3 h the e vfcw was operated for 15 days for each phase the operational conditions are presented in detail in table 1 2 3 sampling and analysis 2 3 1 determination of vfcws effectiveness the liquor samples were daily collected in triplicate from the influent tank and effluent of anode and cathode chambers the parameters of po4 3 p n i e no3 n no2 n nh4 n s i e so4 2 s s2o3 2 s s2 and total fe contents were examined to determine the effectiveness of vfcws the po4 3 p no3 n no2 n so4 2 s and s2o3 2 s

using a uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr5000 usa apha 2012 the ph do and orp were measured with a portable multi parameter analyzer hach hq30d usa furthermore to investigate the coupling interactions between n transformation and s cycle along the longitudinal direction of the e vfcw liquor samples were collected from all the sampling ports adjacent to the electrodes of the e vfcw fig 1 at phases 2 5 6 and 7 2 3 2 determination of n2o accumulation the headspace equilibrium technique was used to determine the dissolved n2o in the effluent liu et al 2015 in brief approximately 10 ml of n2 99 999 were injected into the headspace bottle to displace the liquor sample subsequently the bottle was shaken vigorously for 30 min at 25 c the headspace n2o was measured by gc ecd shimadzu gc 14c japan and the dissolved n2o concentration was calculated based on the degree of saturation relative to the n2o content in air 2 3 3 identification of solid phase fe p and s for solid phase fe p and s transformation analysis solid samples were collected from the anode and cathode chambers after the experiment the morphological characteristics of the electrode and packing surface were imaged and

denitrification to further reveal the role of solid phase s deposit in denitrification in vitro batch experiment was performed briefly 100 g of coconut fiber packing were collected from the cathode chamber and gently washed thrice with ultra pure water subsequently synthetic wastewater 100 mg l 1 of no3 n 2 mg l 1 of po4 3 p and 200 mg l 1 of hco3 was spiked into a 500 ml bottle containing the pretreated packing the bottle was incubated at 28 1 c in a shaking incubator with a rotation speed of 135 r min 1 liquor samples were collected at regular intervals and no3 n no2 n nh4 n s2o3 2 s and so4 2 s contents were determined the stoichiometric calculations of so4 2 s formation are presented in detail in supporting information 2 5 microbial examination the sludge samples were collected from the anode and upper middle and bottom parts of the cathode chambers of the e vfcw in phase 4 and termed as e a e c1 e c2 and e c3 respectively the inoculated sludge sample was denoted in the samples were cryopreserved at 40 c until further molecular biological tests genomic dna extraction from the sludge samples was performed through three freeze thaw cycles followed by a lysis process at 65 c wang et al 2018a the extracted dna was quantified spectrophotometrically and its quality was verified on an ethidium agarose gel rt pcr was performed using stepone plus system applied biosystems usa nested lightcycler was used to quantify the gene copies with primers targeting nirs nirk and nosz genes respectively table s2 amplification was conducted for 3 min at 95 c followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 10 s 62 5 c for 20 s and 72 c for 10 s fluorescence detection was performed after each cycle at the melting temperature the rt pcr assays were performed in triplicate the extracted dna samples were submitted to the majorbio institute shanghai china for pyrosequencing the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene targeting bacteria was amplified with a cluster of broad range primers 338f 5 act cct

amplification was verified by electrophoresis of the fragment in 2 0 wt agarose gels with quantifluortm st system promega usa followed by sequencing based on illumina platform the sequences were retrieved based on similarity and clustered by using silva databases https www arb silva de 3 results and discussion 3 1 p elimination pathways p has been reported to be one of the key nutrients that limits productivity in waterbody abell et al 2010 and p limitation control strategy has been increasingly applied to halt the eutrophication process sterner 2008 thus there is an urgent need to further reduce p discharge loads from wwtps in the present study electro coagulation with sacrificial fe anode exhibited enhanced p elimination as shown in table 1 and fig s1a p removal mainly occurred in the anode chamber accounting for 92 8 99 4 of the po4 3 p elimination within the e vfcw in addition p was further removed in the cathode chamber table 1 the p removal effectiveness correlated with hrt and current density table 1 when the hrt declined from 12 to 3 h po4 3 p in the effluent increased from 0 044 0 012 to 0 066 0 014 mg l 1 in addition when the current density decreased to 0 01 ma cm 2 po4 3 p in the effluent further increased to 0 159 0 031 mg l 1 table 1 optimal p removal effectiveness was achieved under hrt and current density of 3 h and 0 10 ma cm 2 respectively with 0 025 0 010 mg l 1 residual po4 3 p in the effluent table 1 it must be noted that the ph elevation in both the anode and cathode favored p elimination fig s2 bektas et al 2004 in the cvfcw the p removal rates decreased from 8 5 4 9 to 0 8 3 9 when the hrt declined from 12 to 1 h in addition pseudo first order model indicated that the negligible p adsorption capacity of coconut fiber 0 0096 mg g 1 did not contribute to the significant p elimination thus plant assimilation and substrates absorption in cws were less than satisfactory for advanced p removal under low hrt conditions to reveal the underlying p elimination pathways in the e vfcw the deposited particles in the anode and cathode chambers were analyzed by using xrd and xps as shown in fig 2 a a small xrd peak denoting fem po4 n crystalline minerals was detected for the anode chamber indicating that negligible amount of fe2 or fe3 directly contributed to p precipitation the binding energy at the xps peak position of fe2p3 2 of the pulverized particles in the anode chamber was about 711 3 ev coinciding with the feooh 711 5 ev and fe2o3 710 7 711 2 ev patterns moreover the xps peak position of p2p coincided with kh2po4 133 5 ev these results revealed that p removal in the anode chamber was achieved through co precipitation fe n oh po4 and adsorption feooh po4 table s3 the sem images suggested that the submicron particles deposited on the anode surface fig s3a effectively enhanced the mass transfer rate for p elimination almeida et al 2010 kim et al 2011 the xrd and xps analyses of the cathode chamber suggested that p might have been deposited on the packing matrix in forms of fepo4 2h2o crystalline minerals and feooh po4 table s3 3 2 sulfate reduction relieved fe release residual fe release up to about 30 mg l 1 has been reported to be an inherent drawback of electrolysis integrated cws with an fe anode gao et al 2017 posing potential toxicity to aquatic organisms however the findings of the present study could provide perspective for reducing fe release in e vfcw with fe anode in phase 1 the released fe content in the anode and cathode chambers was 9 76 1 97 and 0 67 0 55 mg l 1 respectively fig 3 a indicating that cathode chamber could serve as an eco buffer basin for the removal of the electrolytic fe it must be noted that the removal of total fe could alleviate the biological inhibitory effect on denitrifying microorganisms wang et al 2018b however in the present study fe variations presented the opposite trend under shorter hrt phase 5 or lower current density phase 7 fig 3a interestingly changes in the fe content correlated with the so4 2 s variations trend in the cathode chamber fig 3 therefore it was speculated that the s cycle might exert a significant role in the removal or release of fe in cathode chamber moreover srb e g desulfovibrio enrichment was observed in the cathode chamber fig 7 c and so4 2 s reduction to sulfide in the cathode chamber might result in significant fe precipitation van der welle et al 2007 the xrd and xps peak positions of s2p3 2 160 9 ev and s2p1 2 162 7 ev confirmed in situ fes and fes2 formation table s3 besides s2 precipitation in e vfcw could also alleviate h2s emission however during inadequate electrons supply fe and so4 2 s release was observed in the cathode chamber fig 3 which might be ascribed to the electrons resupply by fes and fes2 to drive no3 n reduction process except for the co precipitation of fe and s the oxidation of fe2 β feooh and precipitation with po4 3 p fepo4 2h2o in the cathode chamber might also contribute to the reduction of fe release fig 2d 3 3 coupling mechanisms of s cycle and n elimination elimination of no3 n has been increasingly addressed owing to its negative health effects bergquist et al 2016 although p limitation control strategy has been observed to improves water quality in several aquatic ecosystems broader environmental goals have not been achieved especially in coastal marine and estuaries conley et al 2009 leading to widespread recognition to control n inputs in the present study multi pathway of no3 n reduction was proposed the no3 n elimination predominantly occurred in the cathode chamber table 2 whereas 13 9 30 2 of no3 n removal was observed fig s4a in the anode chamber furthermore prolonged hrt tended to enhance no3 n removal effectiveness when the hrt was decreased from 12 to 3 h and further to 1 h the residual no3 n content in the effluent was 0 35 0 20 0 74 0 28 and 2 10 0 31 mg l 1 respectively table 2 moreover lower current density 0 05 ma cm 2 notably decreased no3 n removal rate p 0 001 whereas higher current density 0 05 ma cm 2 exerted negligible effects on denitrification in the cathode chamber p 0 683 table 2 table 2 shows that small amount of no2 n accumulated in the cathode chamber except under hrt of 1 h 0 25 0 18 mg l 1 or current density of 0 01 ma cm 2 0 34 0 26 mg l 1 however it is worth noting that the byproduct of nh4 n accumulation in the cathode chamber could impede the discharged effluent s quality to satisfied the stringent standards e g environmental quality standards for surface water in china in phase 1 4 37 2 11 mg l 1 of nh4 n was discharged from the e vfcw table 2 and it was speculated that the nh4 n accumulation might be ascribed to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra process using femsn s0 fe or fe2 as electrons donors interestingly nh4 n release could be effectively alleviated by hrt regulation under hrt of 12 h the nh4 n accumulation rate reached 24 6 13 0 whereas it dropped to 4 7 3 5 under hrt of 3 h fig s4 this response is similar to those reported in previous studies which suggested that higher fe n or s n ratio favored dnra process dolejs et al 2015 wang et al 2015 in the present study the optimal hrt and current density were noted to be 3 h and 0 05 ma cm 2 for tn elimination respectively with 1 10 0 54 mg l 1 nh4 n 0 10 0 08 mg l 1 no2 n 0 74 0 28 mg l 1 no3 n and 1 94 0 55 mg l 1 tn in the effluent of e vfcw table 2 to investigate the underlying coupling interactions between s cycle and no3 n elimination in e vfcw phases 2 5 6 and 7 were chosen as the typical operation modes to examine the effects of electrons storage and resupply modes on n and s transformations along the longitudinal direction of the e vfcw as shown in fig 4a no3 n elimination and nh4 n accumulation predominantly occurred in the upper cathode chamber in phase 2 with longer hrt in addition so4 2 s removal occurred throughout the cathode chambers in phase 2 table s4 in phase 6 the so4 2 s content increased while the no3 n concentration decreased in the bottom cathode chamber fig 4c demonstrating that electrons resupply by deposited s might accelerate denitrification or dnra processes with shorter hrt although powered by higher current density similar trends were also observed for the n and s transformations in phase 5 shorter hrt and phase 7 lower current density fig 4 in detail so4 2 s and nh4 n contents tended to increase along the longitudinal direction of the cathode chamber while no3 n concentration exhibited the opposite trend this result revealed that the deposited s on the matrix of e vfcws might exert a crucial role in electrons resupply during electrons supply demand disequilibrium occurred besides negligible amount of s2 or s2o3 2 s was detected in all the liquor samples in the cathode chamber the deposition s0 fes and fes2 fig 2 and enrichment of s oxidizing bacteria e g thiobacillus fig 7c suggested the possible occurrence of s driven autotrophic no3 n reduction to validate this hypothesis batch test for no3 n reduction was performed without organic carbon or h2 supply as shown in fig 5 rapid no3 n elimination was observed in the initial 24 h notable quantity of no2 n accumulated reaching 22 0 mg l 1 in the initial 20 h and then decreased to 3 1 mg l 1 at 36 h dnra accounted for approximately 13 0 of no3 n removal with 13 1 mg l 1 nh4 n accumulation fig 5 furthermore as the trend of generation was similar to the theoretical so4 2 s formation fig 5 s driven autotrophic denitrification or dnra could have occurred in the cathode chamber however so4 2 s production was lower than the theoretical so4 2 s formation indicating that reduced s i e s0 fes and fes2 did not serve as the sole electron donor for no3 n reduction nevertheless considering that the migration of some granulated waste fe scraps in the anode chamber to the cathode chamber and enrichment of fe oxidizing bacteria e g unclassified gallionellaceae it can be speculated that fe might contribute to autotrophic denitrification or dnra process in the cathode chamber these results demonstrated that no3 n removal was not solely accomplished by h2 driven denitrification because fe oxidation s cycle and dnra complicated the denitrogenation pathways the multi pathway of n transformations proposed in the present study could enhance no3 n removal when compared with those reported in previous studies gao et al 2017 xu et al 2017 on the one hand granulated waste fe scraps exerted a crucial role in electrons supply it has been reported that zvi packed bed is an alternative for rapid no3 n reduction fu et al 2014 and that the electrolytic fe2 favored electrons transfer on zvi surface accelerating autotrophic denitrification rate xu et al 2012 on the other hand s cycle contributed to electrons storage and resupply for no3 n reduction the reduced s0 fes and fes2 on the carrier matrix in cws exhibited longer srt which was speculated to persistently resupply electrons for denitrification the electrons storage and resupply modes during s cycle could shed new lights on relieving the inherent drawback of low transfer rate of no3 n reduction owing to insolubility of h2 besides sem images showed that the micron scale solid particles could provide more binding sites for db favoring s driven denitrification dynamics fig s3b c these results are consistent with a previous study that s cycle could enhance the electron utilization rate during no3 n reduction wang et al 2009 quantification of electrons storage and resupply during s cycle and no3 n removal was performed based on stoichiometric calculations as shown in table 3 hrt and current density exerted significant impacts on electrons transfers and distributions in phase 1 longer hrt and phase 6 higher current density 6 3 1 0 and 3 5 0 6 mmol e cycle were stored in the form of s0 fes and fes2 respectively table 3 when hrt or current density declined no3 n reduction was partly supported by the reserved electrons in phase 5 shorter hrt and phase 7 lower current density 1 0 0 7 and 1 5 0 3 mmol e cycle derived from solid s were resupplied for denitrification or dnra process providing an average of 19 6 and 28 3 electrons for no3 n reduction respectively table 3 as a result e vfcws presented brilliant resilience capabilities to shock loadings owing to the electrons storage and resupply modes of s cycle so4 2 s is a less thermodynamically favorable electrons acceptor than no3 n ontiveros valencia et al 2012 therefore it was hypothesized that so4 2 s reduction rates will decrease with the s n ratios as electrons storage and resupply modes of s cycle are significant in no3 n removal a relatively high s n ratio might be required accordingly the results of the present study could contribute to enhanced nutrients removal from the wwtps effluent with higher s n ratios such as sulfate rich domestic wastewater co treatment of domestic wastewater and industry wastewater enriched with so4 2 s e g landfill leachate mustard and glutamate wastewater 3 4 n2o accumulation to the best of the authors knowledge assessment of potential n2o accumulation within electrolysis integrated cws has not been reported yet in the present study n2o accumulation in liquor samples were notably low 59 3 μg l 1 n2on at hrt within the range of 12 9 h corresponding to only 0 38 of no3 n in e vfcw fig 6 however the n2o accumulation rate slightly increased with the decline in hrt moreover current density exerted a significant role on n2o accumulation in phase 7 314 3 17 4 μg l 1 of dissolved n2on accumulation was noted which corresponded to 2 19 0 12 of the no3 n in e vfcw fig 6 this phenomenon could be ascribed to the limitation of electrons equivalents supply and production for the complete denitrification with decreasing hrt or current density lu and chandran 2010 besides the gaseous phase n2o emission flux to atmosphere was negligible previous studies have reported that 20 30 of initial n in heterotrophic denitrification systems was emitted as n2o when the c n ratio was lower than 3 5 itokawa et al 2001 in the present study n2o accumulation and emission flux in electrochemically assisted bioreactors could be decreased by 95 3 98 5 except phase 7 when compared with those in heterotrophic denitrification systems thus application of e vfcw could emerged as panacea for n2o emission reduction when treating wastewater with low c n ratio 3 5 insight into microbial consortia the rarefaction curve exhibited clear asymptote fig s5a indicating a near complete sequencing of microbial communities the otu number chao and ace valves for the cathode chamber significantly increased when compared with those for the inoculum and anode chamber p 0 05 demonstrating that the electrolytic h2 might stimulate microbial community richness table s5 besides shannon and simpson indices established that the cathode chamber achieved the highest microbial community diversity table s5 which might be owing to the complicated pathways in the cathode chamber including n transfer s cycle and fe oxidation venn diagram showed that the shared otus of all the samples were 65 accounting for merely 3 6 of the total outs fig s5c this finding indicated the presence of distinct differences among the microbial communities in the inoculum anode chamber and cathode chamber however the shared otus along the longitudinal direction of the cathode chambers were 663 accounting for 44 5 of the total otus fig s5d implying that microbial communities in the cathode chambers had relatively higher similarity these findings were further confirmed by principle component analysis pca at the otu level fig s5b rt pcr was performed to compare the copy numbers of nirs nirk and nosz genes targeting db along the longitudinal direction of e vfcw fig 7a shows that the copy numbers of the denitrification genes in the cathode chamber were much higher than those in the anode chamber which corresponded to higher no3 n elimination in the cathode chamber this phenomenon could probably be owing to the excellent surface properties of coconut fiber packing table s1 and in situ h2 supply in the cathode chamber the abundances of nitrite reductase genes σnirs nirk along the longitudinal direction of the cathode chamber were 7 01 8 19 and 1 47 106 copies g 1 packing respectively fig 7a the notably lower abundances of the denitrification groups at the bottom layer of the e vfcws might be owing to the decrease in h2 and no3 n concentrations allowing lower mass transfer rates for denitrification in addition nosz genes were comparable to nitrite reductase genes which favored less n2o accumulation and emission in the e vfcw to gain further microbiological insights into the coupling interactions of no3 n reduction s cycle and fe oxidation 16s rrna sequencing was performed as shown in fig 7b firmicutes 74 7 was the predominant phylum in the inoculated sludge however proteobacteria notably increased after long term exposure to electric field accounting for 2 8 73 5 39 8 39 9 and 51 2 in in e a e c1 e c2 and e c3 respectively as proteobacteria has been reported to be the predominant denitrifying phylum chen et al 2018 it can be concluded that e vfcw might favor enrichment of autotrophic denitrifying bacterial consortia in the anode chamber the genera unclassified gallionellaceae 22 9 and dechloromonas 13 5 were the most abundant microbes which are associated with ferrous driven no3 n reduction chakraborty and picardal 2013 he et al 2016 the synergistic interaction between unclassified gallionellaceae and dechloromonas were estimated to fulfil 13 9 30 2 of no3 n elimination in the anodic zvi bed fig s4a in addition geothrix might contribute to the dissimilatory ferric reduction with escaped h2 from the cathode nevin and lovley 2002 which could accelerate ferrous driven no3 n reduction process with regenerated ferrous in the cathode chamber autohydrogenotrophic db were assumed to exert crucial roles in no3 n elimination chen et al 2015 gao et al 2017 however no strains of the major autohydrogenotrophic denitrifying bacteria namely hydrogenophaga ochrobactrum paracoccus pseudomonas and thauera chen et al 2015 were detected in the cathode chamber indicating that electrolytic h2 might not directly serve as electron donor for no3 n reduction nevertheless the detected microbial communities indicated that electrolytic h2 exerted a crucial role in the coupling interactions between no3 n reduction and s and fe cycles fig 7c for coupling interactions between s cycle and n transformation microbial consortia comprising desulfobulbus desulfomicrobium desulfovibrio desulfuromonas and unclassified desulfuromonadales preferentially fulfilled so4 2 s reduction with h2 castro et al 2000 and subsequently electrons resupply by deposited s promoted no3 n reduction process by s driven no3 n reduction bacteria thiobacillus and limnobacter moon et al 2004 spring et al 2001 the abundances of bacteria involved in n transformations and s cycle are summarized in table s6 fe oxidizing bacterial genera unclassified gallionellaceae and ferritrophicum were also detected in the cathode chamber weiss et al 2007 indicating fe2 and waste fe scraps might contribute to no3 n elimination in the cathode chamber it must be noted that members of the genus clostridium have been identified as dnra bacteria pett ridge and firestone 2005 yin et al 2002 in the present study clostridium sensu stricto 1 exhibited 10 3 5 0 and 3 1 abundance in the upper middle and bottom parts of the cathode chamber respectively fig 7c contributing to significant nh4 n accumulation in the cathode chamber fig s4b it is worth noting that genus clostridium sensu stricto 1 was the predominant microorganisms in the inoculum sludge 34 8 it has been reported that clostridium sensu stricto 1 was the dominant contributor to no3 n reduction in electrochemically assisted cws when inoculated with anaerobic sludge xu et al 2017 therefore anaerobic sludge might not be an appropriate alternative inoculum for minimizing nh4 n accumulation 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that e vfcw favored po4 3 p and no3 n removal for tertiary treatment of wwtps effluent the po4 3 p and no3 n removal rates tended to decrease with hrt or current density po4 3 p was predominantly removed in the sacrificial iron anode chamber by co precipitation and adsorption dnra and s and fe dependent denitrification processes synergistically occurred to drive no3 n transformation in particular the electrons storage and resupply in the s cycle exerted a crucial role in ensuring stable no3 n reduction in e vfcw stoichiometric calculations demonstrated that 3 3 6 6 mmol e cycle were stored in the form of s0 fes and fes2 in e vfcw under longer hrt or higher current density in contrast the deposited s resupplied 19 6 28 3 electrons for no3 n reduction under shorter hrt or lower current density in conclusion this study provides new insights into the associations between nutrients

19052,litter decomposition is a vital part of the global carbon cycle as it determines not only the amount of carbon to be sequestered but also how fast carbon re enters the cycle freshwater systems play an active role in the carbon cycle as it receives and decomposes terrestrial litter material alongside decomposing aquatic plant litter decomposition of organic matter in the aquatic environment is directly controlled by water temperature and nutrient availability which are continuously affected by global change we adapted the tea bag index tbi a highly standardized methodology for determining soil decomposition for lakes by incorporating a leaching factor by placing lipton pyramid tea bags in the aquatic environment for 3 h we quantified the period of intense leaching which usually takes place prior to litter tea decomposition standard tbi methodology was followed after this step to determine how fast decomposition takes place decomposition rate k 1 and how much of the material cannot be broken down and is thus sequestered stabilization factor s a citizen science project was organized to test the aquatic tbi in 40 european lakes located in four climate zones ranging from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic systems we expected that warmer and or eutrophic lakes would have a higher decomposition rate and a more efficient microbial community resulting in less tea material to be sequestered the overall high decomposition rates k 1 found confirm the active role lakes play in the global carbon cycle across climate regions the lakes in the warmer temperate zone displayed a higher decomposition rate k 1 compared to the colder lakes in the continental and polar zones across trophic states decomposition rates were higher in eutrophic lakes compared to oligotrophic lakes additionally the eutrophic lakes showed a higher stabilization s thus a less efficient microbial community compared to the oligotrophic lakes although the variation within this group was high our results clearly show that the tbi can be used to adequately assess the decomposition process in aquatic systems using alien standard litter such as tea provides a powerful way to compare decomposition across climates trophic states and ecosystems by providing standardized protocols a website as well as face to face meetings we also showed that collecting scientifically relevant data can go hand in hand with increasing scientific and environmental literacy in participants gathering process based information about lake ecosystems gives managers the best tools to anticipate and react to future global change furthermore combining this process based information with citizen science thus outreach is in complete agreement with the water framework directive goals as set in 2010 graphical abstract image 1 keywords carbon cycle citizen science decomposition constant european lakes lake management standardized ecological assay 1 introduction the global carbon cycle traces the flow of carbon as it is being recycled and reused throughout the biosphere the cycle entails long term processes such as carbon sequestration to and release from carbon sinks this biogeochemical process exchanges carbon among various compartments including land ocean and atmosphere falkowski et al 2000 the relationships and exchanges between these three compartments have been researched in depth i e hayes and waldbauer 2006 bristow and kennedy 2008 knauth and kennedy 2009 macbean and peylin 2014 while historically carbon fluxes in inland waters have received little attention recently freshwaters have been recognized as an important part in the global carbon cycle kortelainen et al 2004 cole et al 2007 biddanda 2017 freshwater systems are both an export pipeline from land to ocean and an active compartment in which up to 1 0 pg c y 1 or 48 of terrestrial c is sequestrated and stored in its sediments cole et al 2007 butman et al 2016 organic carbon burial in inland water sediments can even exceed the organic carbon sequestration on the ocean floor tranvik et al 2009 inland waters not only include rivers and streams of various sizes but also standing waters ranging from ponds to large lakes and reservoirs they play a distinct role in the global carbon cycle as they are very active sites of carbon cycling especially considering the small area lakes occupy in the landscape i e only 3 of the earth s total land surface area tranvik et al 2009 williamson et al 2009 1 1 drivers of the decomposition process in lakes a core ecosystem process in the carbon cycle is decomposition only a small fraction of the organic carbon produced by terrestrial plants is incorporated into biomass by herbivores or is sequestrated and stored long term in soils cebrian and duarte 1995 battle et al 2000 the remaining 90 of organic carbon is broken down by microbes and invertebrates and quickly reenters the carbon cycle this makes decomposition of plant litter one of the most important ecosystem processes in the biosphere cebrian 1999 factors controlling terrestrial and aquatic decomposition include temperature moisture concentration of acid unhydrolyzable residue aur formerly referred to as lignin phosphorus polyphenol and aur n ratio zhang et al 2008 in terrestrial systems moisture is the first factor that can influence the rate and completeness of decomposition followed by temperature prescott 2010 bradford et al 2017 if these factors surpass their optimal range 60 75 moisture and 30 40 c decomposition is influenced or even inhibited prescott 2010 for aquatic systems optimal ranges of factors controlling decomposition are not yet clear the sustained contact with water inherent to aquatic environments is thought to substantially increase leaching which in turn importantly affects weight loss and decomposition rate gessner et al 2010 1 1 1 decomposition and spatial variability in lakes lakes are heterogeneous in space and time spatial variability in lakes i e a littoral and pelagic zone has direct consequences for decomposition as these zones are directly related to substrate availability wetzel 2001 in the littoral zone both allochthonous and autochthonous leaf litter material accumulates supplying benthic detritivores and microorganisms with substrate to break down the released nutrients in the littoral can be taken up by either macrophytes or microorganisms including cyano bacteria algae green algae and diatoms and periphyton wetzel 2001 in general this is the most ideal place for decomposition because with respect to the pelagic the littoral has more substrate higher water temperatures and contact with the sediment from which detritivores benefit decomposition in the pelagic is slower and less complete due to temperature and substrate limitations nishri et al 2011 1 1 2 decomposition and environmental change as is the case in terrestrial habitats the decomposition process in water is carried out by microbial decomposers and invertebrate detritivores gessner et al 1999 and is sensitive to changes in environmental conditions such as increases in nutrient availability woodward et al 2012 an increase in nutrient availability in aquatic environments has been shown to accelerate the decomposition process as microbes grow faster thus stimulating microbial and invertebrate consumption gulis and suberkropp 2003 woodward et al 2012 eutrophication may however also decrease decomposition efficiency through suppression of the diversity of the decomposing community gessner et al 2010 land use change and climate change have altered nutrient dynamics throughout the world vitousek et al 1997 rockström et al 2009 ferreira et al 2015 thereby intensifying eutrophication effects on decomposition murdoch et al 2000 the process rate of exo enzymes generally the rate limiting factor in microbial decomposition is strongly determined by the temperature of the environment peterson et al 2007 cunha et al 2010 blagodatskaya et al 2016 global warming of surface waters o reilly et al 2015 has a direct accelerating effect on the decomposition process with up to 80 of decomposition being driven by microbial activity pascoal and cássio 2004 griffiths and tiegs 2016 moreover eutrophication may intensify the effect of global warming on litter decomposition in lakes ferreira and chauvet 2011 of course these drivers do not act in isolation but results from published studies are ambiguous on the combined effect of eutrophication and temperature on decomposition marcarelli and wurtsbaugh 2006 durance and ormerod 2007 ferreira and chauvet 2011 other environmental factors such as detritivore density or litter recalcitrance may also change along a climatic gradient thus confounding results of large scale manipulations ferreira et al 2015 to disentangle the effect of temperature and litter quality on the decomposition process among climate regions a standardized litter is needed keuskamp et al 2013 tiegs et al 2013 1 2 measuring decomposition traditionally both in terrestrial and aquatic environments the decomposition process is studied by using leaf litter packs petersen and cummins 1974 wieder and lang 1982 gessner et al 1999 gulis and suberkropp 2003 prescott 2010 ferreira and chauvet 2011 keuskamp et al 2013 ferreira et al 2015 garcía palacios et al 2016 griffiths and tiegs 2016 bradford et al 2017 when leaf litter enters the environment a leaching event will take place gessner et al 1999 water soluble substances leach from the material while microbes colonize and start to break down the litter macroinvertebrates shred the material by eating both the microbial and leaf biomass after which only the most indigestible part of the leaf material remains and is eventually stored in the sediment or sequestered gessner et al 1999 litter packs capture the integrated result of these processes by their weight loss in time the rate at which mass loss takes place is often approximated by the decomposition constant k 1 value prescott 2010 k estimators have been frequently used to capture differences in decomposition at a temporal or spatial scale and among different sources of litter material gessner et al 1999 hayes and waldbauer 2006 garcía palacios et al 2016 additionally the amount of material which is not broken down by the decomposing community stabilization factor s gives information about the effectiveness of the decomposing community under the current environmental conditions this component of the decomposition process has only been added to decomposition analyses fairly recently harmon et al 2009 the resulting two phase decomposition process provides insight in the carbon burial potential of ecosystems in which decomposition is measured in light of climate change mapping or even exploiting the carbon burying potential of ecosystems might provide an opportunity to minimize the effects of anthropogenic co2 emissions keuskamp et al 2013 1 2 1 the tea bag index to see the effects of environmental factors on the decomposition process a standard uniform litter should be subjected to different levels of the desired factor to be able to accurately assess the impact of these factors the decomposition process has to be mapped across scales thus ecosystems and climate regions and at high spatial resolution the tea bag index tbi is a method designed by keuskamp et al 2013 where lipton tea bags are used as standard leaf litter to determine a decomposition constant k 1 and stabilization factor s by determining the amount of recalcitrant material this stabilization factor is a measure for the effectiveness of the decomposing community under current environmental conditions the tbi was originally designed to provide process driven information on soil functions at local regional and global scales in this study we tested its usefulness in the aquatic environment using a fixed incubation period and two types of tea i e green tea to determine the stabilization factor and rooibos tea to determine the decomposition constant the tbi allowed for modelling of both decomposition rate k 1 as stabilization factor s as it is an affordable easy and fast standardized methodology the tbi allows for decomposition experiments at a much larger scale and offers opportunities for citizen science projects 1 3 opportunities of citizen science while citizen science can refer to the remediation of environmental issues or problems by any action individual or group sivek and hungerford 1990 bonney et al 2009 this definition has been broadened as seen in the 2014 edition of the oxford dictionary scientific work undertaken by members of the general public often in collaboration with or under the direction of professional scientists and scientific institutions in recent years citizen science has received increasing attention from the scientific community as a way to combine outreach to address environmental literacy and as a means of doing scientific research at larger scales e g arslan 2012 henderson et al 2012 frontiers in ecology and the environment special issue citizen science forawi 2016 additionally a call for participatory science has been set out at the governmental level the european water framework directive wfd the european parliament and the council of the european union 2000 underlines the importance of public involvement for the successful integration of sustainable water use to successfully protect the ecological quality of all europe s water the wfd promotes citizens engagement in water quality assessment and solutions encourages water managers to invest in outreach initiatives that deal with water awareness and further collaborations with non government organizations ngos dickinson et al 2012 a standardized affordable method such as the tbi index offers a unique opportunity to collect scientifically robust data while contemporarily addressing environmental issues and increasing scientific literacy of citizen science participants 2 objectives the objectives of our study were twofold 1 to assess the potential of the tea bag index tbi as an standard litter decomposition method for the aquatic environment and 2 to test to what extent large scale trophic state climate zone and small scale patterns lake zone drive decomposition as assessed by tbi methodology to this end a multi lake survey 40 lakes was initiated by a consortium of scientists and citizen scientists working together in eu cost program networking lake observatories in europe eu cost action 1201 netlake 3 material and methods this research consisted of a development phase in which we adapted the terrestrial tbi method to the aquatic environment in the second phase we applied the adapted tbi method to assess decomposition rates in multiple lakes across climate zones and a gradient of trophic states 3 1 developing the tea bag index method in the aquatic environment 3 1 1 placement of teabags in lakes the tea bag index was carried out following keuskamp et al 2013 in short 2 5 tetrahedron shaped synthetic tea bags containing green tea lipton pyramid bags ean 87 22700 05552 5 and 2 5 tetrahedron shaped synthetic tea bags containing rooibos tea lipton pyramid bags ean 87 22700 18843 8 were placed together in the littoral i e on top of the sediment 1 in the pelagic 2 and buried 8 cm in the sediment following standard tbi protocol 3 by placing the tea bags at different position in the lake we aimed to follow the spatial variability in decomposition placing the tea bags 8 cm in the lake sediment coincides with the traditional tbi as it prevents tea bag loss due to predation or scouring but still allows the littoral decomposing community to reach the tea bag the standard retrieval time of the tea bags is approximately 90 days after deployment this time scale was used in upscaling part of this research paragraph 2 3 after the tea bags were retrieved they were gently washed with tap water to remove adhering sediment and macroinvertebrates the tea bags were then air dried for 5 days at room temperature after which the remaining dry weight was determined using the same balances to determine initial weight and weighted to the nearest 0 01 g keuskamp et al 2013 3 1 2 adapting tea bag index method to the aquatic environment because decomposition in aquatic environments entails a much larger leaching effect compared to the terrestrial domain we aimed to add this additional leaching effect to the tbi analyses henceforth we experimentally determined a leaching factor to adapt the tbi method to aquatic environments to this end on 29 april 2016 288 lipton green and rooibos tea bags were placed in the pelagic littoral and buried 8 cm in the sediment of a small pond in wageningen the netherlands wadi 0 03 ha zmax 1 1 m 51 987561 5 670941 we placed the pelagic tea bags on 20 locations in the wadi in which every location differed in water depth thickness of the organic layer and amount of macrophyte growth we placed the tea bags between 10 and 100 cm water depth the littoral ones at a water depth of 30 100 cm and the tea bags in the sediment at 8 cm but with different thickness of the organic matter layer 0 9 cm macrophyte growth ranges from 0 to 60 cover the water temperature ranges from 9 5 c to 14 c during the leaching period a bamboo stick was used to facilitate placement and retrieval of the tea bags the variability of the amount and time frame of the leaching phase in aquatic environments is high france et al 1997 gessner et al 1999 however the tbi uses commercial tea which has been dried for several days before packaging this kills the cells resulting in a loss of structural integrity which facilitates the rapid leaching of soluble components gessner et al 1999 to compensate for initial intense leaching we have estimated leaching over the first 3 h of submersion this period is regarded as a pre conditioning phase to reflect leaching that takes place prior to colonization by microbes and can start relatively fast after entering the system krevš et al 2017 the fraction of weight loss relative to the initial weight of the green tea and rooibos tea bags after 3 h submersion in water was calculated for each zone littoral pelagic and sediment in this time frame microbial decomposition is unlikely to break down detectable amounts of material but leaves sufficient time to capture the period of intense leaching from the tea material differences in intense leaching among tea type and location in the water column zone was tested using a pairwise t test with bonferroni correction this leaching factor was used as a correction factor for the initial tea weight as leaching is not an active part of the decomposition process in further use of the tbi methodology in this paper see below for model calculations 3 1 3 two phase decomposition model with leaching factor decomposition rates and the amount of recalcitrant material i e remaining fraction are estimated using a model in which a two phase decomposition process is assumed as described by wieder and lang 1982 keuskamp et al 2013 eq 1 w t a e k 1 t 1 a in which wt is the remaining mass of leaf litter in grams after the incubation period t in days k 1 is the decomposition rate in day 1 and a is the decomposable fraction function eq 1 was parameterized by fitting the weight losses of both tea types over 4 incubation periods 3 h and 27 89 138 days in the same wadi pond located in wageningen the netherlands from 29 april 2016 until 14 september 2016 in the tbi methodology green and rooibos tea bags from the same location are coupled to recreate this two phase decomposition model using only one incubation period in which rooibos tea allows for estimation of k and green tea for a as established by keuskamp et al 2013 as the decomposition process progresses part of the labile decomposable fraction stabilizes and becomes recalcitrant prescott 2010 this stabilization is conditional on the environment and will thus result in deviations of the actual decomposed fraction a this inhibiting effect of the environment on the decomposition process is captured in the stabilization factor s which is calculated using equation 2 eq 2 s 1 a g h g in which s is the stabilization factor a g is the decomposable fraction and h g is the hydrolysable fraction of green tea a g is determined by dividing the final weight by its initial weight of green tea h g is the sum of the nonpolar extractives water solubles and acid solubles of green tea as determined by keuskamp et al 2013 using a sequential carbon fraction extraction technique by ryan et al 1990 subsequently equation 1 was rewritten to calculate the decomposition constant k 1 using the one time point approach of the tbi methodology for the decomposable fraction a the decomposable fraction of rooibos tea was used a r calculated by multiplying the hydrolysable fraction of rooibos h r by 1 s the leaching factor was used as a correction factor for the initial tea weight by subtracting the multiplication of the initial tea mass times the leaching factor specific for the position of the tea bag in the water column as leaching reduces the initial tea weight it specifically reduces the relative size of the hydrolysable fraction for both green tea and rooibos tea h g and h r therefore we subtracted the specific leaching factor for green tea or rooibos tea from respectively h g and h r and divided this by 1 leaching factor the resulting corrected hydrolysable fraction was thereafter used to calculate the stabilization factor s and decomposition rate k 1 to assess the effect of the inclusion of a leaching factor on our results we compared the results obtained using the leaching factor to the results obtained when using the traditional tbi calculation i e not applying the leaching factor the variance within groups was larger compared to when the leaching factor was used leading to non significant results between groups results not shown available upon request moreover leaching in the aquatic environment plays a larger role compared to the terrestrial ecosystem we therefore recommend not to disregard the leaching factor when deploying the tbi method in the aquatic environment 3 2 scaling up testing large and small scales patterns using citizen science citizen science relies on willing individuals with an interest in their environment lakes and curious about science therefore the lakes were selected based on the following criteria the presence of a citizen scientist teamed up with science partner to ensure quality assurance when collecting data and timely feedback during the sampling period prior limnological knowledge of the lake was considered to be an important factor when choosing among different lakes in a single area additional quality assurance check points in the sampling procedure included standardization of scales used and photographic checks of tea bag placement to ensure standardization of the tbi methodology we trained scientists and citizen scientists during a netlake eu cost

workshop the protocols were further fine tuned and a website and facebook group was created after which 25 groups signed up to study a lake for this european wide citizen scientist project six lakes repeated the tbi measurement in 2017 and additional 8 lakes joined in 2017 the results from tbi placement in 7 lakes in 2015 were included bringing the total number of lakes to 40 fig 1 appendix a for the tbi methodology tea bags were weighted to the nearest 0 01 g according to the provided protocol visit www nioo knaw nl netlake citizen science to access the protocols 3 2 1 study sites for citizen science the tbi adapted to the aquatic environment was deployed in 40 lakes across europe in 2015 2017 fig 1 using the köppen geiger climate classification lakes were assigned to their specific climate region rubel and kottek 2010 for the italian lakes the more detailed classification by rubel et al 2017 was used volunteers placed more than 500 tea bag pairs in the littoral pelagic and sediment zones across four köppen geiger climate zones 27 lakes in temperate regions without a dry season köppen geiger climate region cf 3 lakes with a dry summer cs 5 lakes in cold continental regions without a dry season df and 5 lakes in a polar region with a tundra climate et in addition we placed ibutton temperature loggers in the littoral zone in 34 out of the 40 european lakes to be able to assign trophic state to each of the participating lakes volunteers were asked to measure secchi depth using the trophic state index tsi for lakes carlson 1977 secchi depths were converted to a trophic state index using equation 3 eq 3 t s i 10 6 l n s d l n 2 where tsi trophic state index and sd secchi disk depth m a tsi score of above 70 indicates a hypereutrophic lake a score between 50 and 70 is classified as eutrophic between 40 and 50 as mesotrophic and below 40 as oligotrophic in total across our lakes 105 sites were chosen to determine the decomposition rate and stabilization constant of these 105 sites 60 sites were located in the littoral zone 34 sites in the pelagic and 11 sites in the sediment appendix a each site was composed of 2 5 tea bag pairs of the deployed teabags 313 tea bag pairs where used for further analysis causes of exclusion included loss of tea bags due to vandalism or weather conditions or inaccurate final tea weight determination due to trapped macrofauna sediment particles or biofilm formation 3 2 2 data analyses differences in fraction mass loss for green and rooibos tea among climate zones and tsi was tested using an anova modified to use permutation tests instead of normal theory tests aovp this same test was used to determine differences among the decomposition constant k 1 and stabilization factor s between climate regions tsi and position in the water column to avoid pseudoreplication hurlbert 1984 we used lake position in the water column as our experimental unit allowing us to test for differences in decomposition at lake zones across a climatic and trophic gradient as we expected that our unbalanced design could have an effect on the outcome of our analyses we ran a separate analyses where we randomly selected 5 lakes in the cf climatic region temperate climate without a dry season overrepresented in our dataset and all other climate regions were retained in the original sample size all analyses were carried out using r version 3 2 3 with base package stats and the dplyr v0 4 3 lmperm v2 1 0 ggplot2 v2 2 1 and minpack lm v1 2 0 package wickham 2009 elzhov et al 2015 r core team 2015 wickham and francois 2015 wheeler and torchiano 2016 4 results 4 1 developing the tea bag index method for the aquatic environment the average weight loss of tea bags placed in a shallow eutrophic lake for 3 h differed based on the location on average 0 243 mg 0 059 sd of green tea and 0 098 mg 0 030 sd of rooibos tea was leached from the tea bags over the 3 h table 1 additionally the leaching fraction differed significantly between the tea bags placed in the pelagic zone and tea bags placed in the littoral zone or buried 8 cm in the sediment fig 2 p 0 003 water depth macrophyte cover or thickness of the organic matter layer on top of the sediment did not significantly influence the leaching factor to determine the decomposition constant and stabilization factor using the tbi in an aquatic environment this leaching fraction specific for the position of the tea bags in the water column resulting in pelagic littoral and sediment fraction was used to correct the initial tea weight recreating the decomposition dynamics of rooibos and green tea in an aquatic environment required a multi harvest approach as previously described by keuskamp et al 2013 fig 3 green tea decomposed relatively fast and began to level off after 30 60 days depending on the location in the water column rooibos tea decomposed much slower and only started to level off at the end of the experiment 130 days as green tea reached its limit value relatively fast it allowed for estimation of s while rooibos was still being actively decomposed allowing the estimation of k 1 based on these results the tbi incubations for the across site assessment where kept at 90 days similar to the standard tbi protocol for soils 4 2 rolling out to larger scale using citizen science 4 2 1 decomposition constant k1 and stabilization factor s the calculated decomposition constant k 1 and stabilization factor s per lake was compared to the range of k 1 and s as found by keuskamp et al 2013 the values for s found in our experiment ranged from 0 39 to 0 8 average 0 106 0 191 sd the decomposition constant k 1 values calculated in our experiment ranged from 0 00001 to 0 06 day 1 average 0 0078 day 1 0 0067 sd these values are somewhat higher than the ones obtained by keuskamp et al 2013 fig 4 4 2 2 decomposition and spatial variability in lakes we placed tea bags at different positions in the lake i e in the pelagic in the littoral between aquatic plants and buried in the lake sediment to follow different decomposing communities a significant difference was found for relative mass loss of rooibos tea p 0 002 and for the relative mass loss of green tea p 0 001 between the pelagic littoral and sediment in lake zones likewise a significant difference between these positions in the water column was found for the stabilization factor s p 0 042 and for the decomposition constant k 1 p 0 045 4 2 3 climate region after correcting for the overrepresentation of the temperate region without a dry season cf a significant difference among the relative weight loss per rooibos tea bag was found p 0 0001 which resulted in a significant difference for decomposition factor k 1 among climate regions p 0 0007 fig 5 a no significant difference in the rate at which green tea decomposed across the climate regions was found p 0 052 consequently no significant climate region effect in the stabilization factor s p 0 078 was found the temperate regions cf and cs had significantly higher decomposition rates than the cold continental region df and polar region et p 0 05 4 2 4 trophic gradient the trophic state index could not be calculated for 8 of the 40 lakes as no secchi depth was available during the tea bag incubation period twelve oligotrophic and 17 eutrophic lakes were subsampled and tested against 7 mesotrophic lakes per tested parameter hypereutrophic lakes n 2 and lakes where trophic state could not be determined were excluded from the analysis significant differences among trophic state were found in mass loss of rooibos tea p 0 026 and for the decomposition constant k 1 p 0 012 on average a higher decomposition rate was found in eutrophic lakes however the highest decomposition rates were found in an oligotrophic lake p 0 05 additionally a significance difference of mass loss of green tea were found p 0 007 leading to a significant difference for stabilization factor s p 0 004 over trophic states fig 5b eutrophic sites had significantly higher stabilization constants that oligotrophic and mesotrophic sites p 0 05 5 discussion litter decomposition is widely used as an indicator of ecosystem functioning in streams and rivers gessner et al 1997 the weight loss of two tea types a highly standardized litter material was followed in order to determine the suitability for the use of this tea bag methodology tbi in an aquatic environment we introduced the leaching factor to correct for the initial leaching event which plays a much larger role in aquatic decomposition compared to terrestrial decomposition we recommend that this leaching factor should be added to standard tbi methodology to calculate the decomposition constant and stabilization factor in aquatic environments by placing tea bags in 40 lakes across four climate zones and trophic states we show that the tbi with leaching factor adjustment is able to pick up a temperature and eutrophication signal here we offer an extension of the tbi methodology in an effort to create a validated global decomposition map across ecosystems as proposed by keuskamp et al 2013 and garcía palacios et al 2016 5 1 tea bag index the tea bag index tbi methodology is a standardized litter bag experiment to determine terrestrial decomposition similar to those performed since the 1970s winterboum 1978 however the simultaneous use of two tea types used in the current study as well allows for only one time point to calculate decomposition rates this greatly reduces the amount of samples needed and effort required by citizen scientists additionally using the tbi provides not only the traditional decomposition constant k 1 reflecting the decomposition rate but also a stabilization factor s reflecting the amount of material that cannot be broken down this gives additional information about the decomposition curve but also about the amount of the tea material that can be broken down by the microbial community in situ under the present environmental conditions adapting this methodology to aquatic environments creates opportunities to include these ecosystems in global carbon maps and for non experts to contribute to decomposition databases the tbi excludes detrivorous macrofauna that play a role in natural decomposition as they feed not only on the litter itself but also on the fungal mycelium colonizing the litter gessner et al 1999 garcía palacios et al 2016 as with the traditional fine mesh litter bag method by excluding these detritivores their contribution to the decomposition process and rate is not taken into account benfield 2006 as macroinvertebrates are especially sensitive to changes they are likely to be impacted by degradation of their ecosystem quite early on thus effecting the decomposition process early on gessner et al 2010 hodkinson and jackson 2005 if the tbi methodology would be used for the early detection of ecosystem degradation the exclusion of detritivores might lead to an underestimation of k 1 and s however the microbial community can also respond quickly to environmental change as shown by suberkropp and chauvet 1995 where significant changes in microbial decomposition of leaves were seen after 5 days of transferring the leaf material to a stream with contrasting water chemistry the tbi can thus provide a good estimation of the speed k 1 and completeness s of microbial decomposition which is not confounded with detritivore effects other substantial benefits of the tbi are ease of deployment and low costs the use of alien standard litter is necessary to be able to compare decomposition rates k 1 and stabilization factor s across climate zones and trophic states but especially across ecosystems this does not replace the need of decomposition experiments with allochthonous or local autochthonous litter in terrestrial and aquatic systems but rather adds additional information transcending ecosystem boundaries and allowing for global mapping of a key ecosystem process 5 1 1 tea bag index methodology standardization for the aquatic environment the decomposition process in the aquatic environment can be described in three stages leaching conditioning and fragmentation in the decomposition process of tree leaves leaching can take up to 24 h for autumn leaves and up to several days or even weeks for fresh leaves france et al 1997 gessner et al 1999 we defined a leaching period of 3 h sufficient to capture the initial intense leaching of sun dried tea material whitworth et al 2014 the contribution of intense leaching to mass loss in these 3 h differed between lake zones fig 2 stronger contact with water in the pelagic resulted in more pronounced leaching from tea bags placed there compared to tea bags placed in the littoral or in sediment these differences should be and have been taken into account in determining the k 1 and s in each lake zone by measuring weight loss at five different time points we were able to fit a two phase model for decomposition as an independent control of the quality of single point tbi estimations of k 1 and s fig 3 both green tea and rooibos tea decomposition in our lakes followed the same model as in the laboratory dry conditions fig 2 in keuskamp et al 2013 this clearly shows that the tbi can be used to adequately assess the decomposition process in aquatic systems 5 2 factors influencing the decomposition process the rate of terrestrial decomposition is determined by several factors including temperature moisture and ph the quantity and quality of the decomposing material and the microbial community involved in decomposition chapin et al 2002 temperature affects the decomposition process not only by determining the activity of decomposing community but also the leaching stage whitworth et al 2014 looked at the effect of temperature on doc leaching from natural litter after 5 h of incubating sterile litter with nanopure water litter placed at 25 c and 30 c lost roughly double the amount of doc compared to litter that incubated at 5 c 10 c 15 c and 20 c whitworth et al 2014 fig 1 additionally the amount of doc leaching at 5 c 10 c 15 c and 20 c is very similar during the 3 h leaching event in this research the water temperature ranged from 9 5 to 14 c in lake wadi at the start of the european scale tbi experiment the water temperatures ranged from 9 7 c to 25 1 c of our european lakes 19 of the 34 lakes had a start temperature colder than 20 c while 15 have a temperature of above 20 c at the leaching phase for these 15 lakes we might underestimate the weight loss by leaching when using the leaching factor determined in lake wadi according to whitworth et al 2014 however as we have used dried tea leaves as opposed to natural litter material the difference between the amount of leaching at 20 c and 20 c might be less pronounced in aquatic environments as opposed to the terrestrial ecosystem moisture is not a determining factor while oxygen plays a much more important role pascoal and cássio 2004 as oxygen concentrations drop microbial decomposition slows down substantially albeit not coming to a full stop gomes et al 2018 aquatic microbial communities frequently encounter low oxic conditions due to anthropogenic factors such as intensified agriculture resulting in higher nutrient concentrations in waters this stimulates microbial activity depleting oxygen as it is used as the primary electron acceptor during respiration by aerobic organisms in the aquatic environment anaerobic organisms will then take over and will use other electron acceptors such as nitrate and sulfate thus continuing the decomposition process krevš and kučinskienė 2012 these essential environmental differences between terrestrial and aquatic system contributed to the wider range of decomposition rates k 1 and stabilization factors s as found in this study the negative s values that were frequently obtained indicate the net loss of stable compounds a phenomenon not frequently seen in terrestrial deployment of tbi keuskamp et al 2013 the hypothetical un decomposable fraction resulting in s includes not only untransformed material that will not decompose under the current conditions but also stabilized primary and secondary compounds clearly in our lakes the microbial community was able to use one of these compounds for growth thus resulting in negative s values additionally higher decomposition rates k 1 were found in this study compared to keuskamp et al 2013 fig 4 terrestrial decomposition rates can be limited by moisture prescott 2010 for obvious reasons moisture is not a limiting factor in lakes as water is a more permeable environment than soil the tea material could be easier accessible for the microbial community the present lack of comparison between terrestrial versus aquatic decomposition hampers our understanding of this underlying mechanisms governing these differences by disclosing the tbi methodology for the aquatic environment a whole new avenue of comparative research is opened up 5 2 1 climate regions temperature effects on decomposition have been researched extensively in various ecosystems i e zhang et al 2008 griffiths and tiegs 2016 litter decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems k tends to decrease with latitude and increase with temperature and nutrient conditions zhang et al 2008 prescott 2010 the results of our multi lake survey indicated that microbial decomposition rates in lakes in warmer climates are indeed higher than lakes in colder climates this was also found in numerous studies with natural and artificial decomposable material and in other aquatic systems such as streams irons et al 1994 davindson and janssens 2006 boyero et al 2011 aquatic systems are very suitable to assess the impact of climate warming on decomposition as contrary to terrestrial systems moisture availability is not a confounding factor using lakes across latitudinal gradients as surrogates for future temperature changes time for space substitution the effects of climate change on decomposition can be predicted parmesan and yohe 2003 in this study we show that the highly standardized tbi methodology can pick up these effects of climate change using a latitudinal gradient 5 2 2 eutrophication gradient by placing the tbi in lakes across europe we show that the aquatic tbi is able to pick up an eutrophication signal on the in lake decomposition process this confirms our hypothesis that nutrient conditions can greatly influence the decomposition process in a meta analysis of the effect of nutrient addition to in stream decomposition by ferreira et al 2015 nutrients were found to increase the decomposition rate on average by 50 likewise in our study the effect of eutrophication indicated by the trophic state index was found in the decomposition rate k 1 and also in stabilization factor s the occasional high s values found for eutrophic lakes indicate a less efficient microbial community possibly caused by the fact that plenty of decomposable material is present this reduces the need of microbes to decompose the harder more recalcitrant material for growth oligotrophic lakes could have less total litter material available for the decomposing community making them more efficient when breaking down the limited amount of available material overall the variation of s in eutrophic lakes is much higher than for mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes probably due to a cofounding effect with lake zones and climate regions as eutrophication is expected to increase in the future due to increased land use changes population growth and climate change ferreira et al 2015 a better understanding of its effect on ecosystem processes is vital to proper management of water bodies we encountered a high variability within certain trophic states and climate regions and an overrepresentation of certain bins partly a consequence of our citizen science approach nevertheless we were still able to pick up a climate and trophic signal using the tbi for further research a targeted outreach to for instance lake associations and lakeshore inhabitants following a nested sampling design might result in a more evenly distributed dataset and allow deeper analysis of the effects of both climate change and eutrophication on aquatic decompositions additionally the trophic state index based upon a limited number of secchi readings is not ideal to determine the trophic state of a lake for further research the nutrient status of the lakes should be assessed using simple inexpensive kits and or via remote sensing e g shi et al 2018 5 3 opportunity for management the european water framework directive 2000 60 eu wfd has been implemented to restore europe s waters and is the most substantial and ambitious piece of european environmental legislation to date however since its implementation 18 years ago the main goal of good ecological status of all eu waters has not been achieved voulvoulis et al 2017 assign this to the lack of integrated catchment management i e considering the whole system a pre requisite for the effective implementation of the wfd methods such as the tbi can be applied in both terrestrial and aquatic systems to assess a key ecosystem process incorporation of decomposition rates and stabilization factors in standard monitoring regime can be of great use to achieve this shift to more system based approach studying decomposition a fundamental ecological process on the catchment scale can advance integrative water management whilst at the same time contributing to scientific research on a global scale besides achieving a good status for all europe s water the wfd aims to actively involve citizens in the catchment based approach the tbi is highly suitable to combine these goals in one methodology this standardized affordable method offers a unique opportunity to combine the goals of the wfd while simultaneously addressing environmental and scientific literacy 6 conclusions the lack of a standardized litter decomposition method for aquatic vs terrestrial ecosystems is an obstacle for the development of common decomposition models garcía palacios et al 2016 by adding a leaching factor to the tbi methodology currently only validated for terrestrial systems the tbi methodology can be deployed in aquatic systems the tbi methodology can pick up patterns in climate and eutrophication across ecosystems this is a first step in using the tbi in mapping global decomposition patterns in aquatic systems future studies should look at balanced design and more suitable predictor variables temperature oxygen and nutrient concentrations citizen science can contribute to gathering relevant data on ecosystem processes across ecosystems using standardized easy and cheap methodologies

19052,litter decomposition is a vital part of the global carbon cycle as it determines not only the amount of carbon to be sequestered but also how fast carbon re enters the cycle freshwater systems play an active role in the carbon cycle as it receives and decomposes terrestrial litter material alongside decomposing aquatic plant litter decomposition of organic matter in the aquatic environment is directly controlled by water temperature and nutrient availability which are continuously affected by global change we adapted the tea bag index tbi a highly standardized methodology for determining soil decomposition for lakes by incorporating a leaching factor by placing lipton pyramid tea bags in the aquatic environment for 3 h we quantified the period of intense leaching which usually takes place prior to litter tea decomposition standard tbi methodology was followed after this step to determine how fast decomposition takes place decomposition rate k 1 and how much of the material cannot be broken down and is thus sequestered stabilization factor s a citizen science project was organized to test the aquatic tbi in 40 european lakes located in four climate zones ranging from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic systems we expected that warmer and or eutrophic lakes would have a higher decomposition rate and a more efficient microbial community resulting in less tea material to be sequestered the overall high decomposition rates k 1 found confirm the active role lakes play in the global carbon cycle across climate regions the lakes in the warmer temperate zone displayed a higher decomposition rate k 1 compared to the colder lakes in the continental and polar zones across trophic states decomposition rates were higher in eutrophic lakes compared to oligotrophic lakes additionally the eutrophic lakes showed a higher stabilization s thus a less efficient microbial community compared to the oligotrophic lakes although the variation within this group was high our results clearly show that the tbi can be used to adequately assess the decomposition process in aquatic systems using alien standard litter such as tea provides a powerful way to compare decomposition across climates trophic states and ecosystems by providing standardized protocols a website as well as face to face meetings we also showed that collecting scientifically relevant data can go hand in hand with increasing scientific and environmental literacy in participants gathering process based information about lake ecosystems gives managers the best tools to anticipate and react to future global change furthermore combining this process based information with citizen science thus outreach is in complete agreement with the water framework directive goals as set in 2010 graphical abstract image 1 keywords carbon cycle citizen science decomposition constant european lakes lake management standardized ecological assay 1 introduction the global carbon cycle traces the flow of carbon as it is being recycled and reused throughout the biosphere the cycle entails long term processes such as carbon sequestration to and release from carbon sinks this biogeochemical process exchanges carbon among various compartments including land ocean and atmosphere falkowski et al 2000 the relationships and exchanges between these three compartments have been researched in depth i e hayes and waldbauer 2006 bristow and kennedy 2008 knauth and kennedy 2009 macbean and peylin 2014 while historically carbon fluxes in inland waters have received little attention recently freshwaters have been recognized as an important part in the global carbon cycle kortelainen et al 2004 cole et al 2007 biddanda 2017 freshwater systems are both an export pipeline from land to ocean and an active compartment in which up to 1 0 pg c y 1 or 48 of terrestrial c is sequestrated and stored in its sediments cole et al 2007 butman et al 2016 organic carbon burial in inland water sediments can even exceed the organic carbon sequestration on the ocean floor tranvik et al 2009 inland waters not only include rivers and streams of various sizes but also standing waters ranging from ponds to large lakes and reservoirs they play a distinct role in the global carbon cycle as they are very active sites of carbon cycling especially considering the small area lakes occupy in the landscape i e only 3 of the earth s total land surface area tranvik et al 2009 williamson et al 2009 1 1 drivers of the decomposition process in lakes a core ecosystem process in the carbon cycle is decomposition only a small fraction of the organic carbon produced by terrestrial plants is incorporated into biomass by herbivores or is sequestrated and stored long term in soils cebrian and duarte 1995 battle et al 2000 the remaining 90 of organic carbon is broken down by microbes and invertebrates and quickly reenters the carbon cycle this makes decomposition of plant litter one of the most important ecosystem processes in the biosphere cebrian 1999 factors controlling terrestrial and aquatic decomposition include temperature moisture concentration of acid unhydrolyzable residue aur formerly referred to as lignin phosphorus polyphenol and aur n ratio zhang et al 2008 in terrestrial systems moisture is the first factor that can influence the rate and completeness of decomposition followed by temperature prescott 2010 bradford et al 2017 if these factors surpass their optimal range 60 75 moisture and 30 40 c decomposition is influenced or even inhibited prescott 2010 for aquatic systems optimal ranges of factors controlling decomposition are not yet clear the sustained contact with water inherent to aquatic environments is thought to substantially increase leaching which in turn importantly affects weight loss and decomposition rate gessner et al 2010 1 1 1 decomposition and spatial variability in lakes lakes are heterogeneous in space and time spatial variability in lakes i e a littoral and pelagic zone has direct consequences for decomposition as these zones are directly related to substrate availability wetzel 2001 in the littoral zone both allochthonous and autochthonous leaf litter material accumulates supplying benthic detritivores and microorganisms with substrate to break down the released nutrients in the littoral can be taken up by either macrophytes or microorganisms including cyano bacteria algae green algae and diatoms and periphyton wetzel 2001 in general this is the most ideal place for decomposition because with respect to the pelagic the littoral has more substrate higher water temperatures and contact with the sediment from which detritivores benefit decomposition in the pelagic is slower and less complete due to temperature and substrate limitations nishri et al 2011 1 1 2 decomposition and environmental change as is the case in terrestrial habitats the decomposition process in water is carried out by microbial decomposers and invertebrate detritivores gessner et al 1999 and is sensitive to changes in environmental conditions such as increases in nutrient availability woodward et al 2012 an increase in nutrient availability in aquatic environments has been shown to accelerate the decomposition process as microbes grow faster thus stimulating microbial and invertebrate consumption gulis and suberkropp 2003 woodward et al 2012 eutrophication may however also decrease decomposition efficiency through suppression of the diversity of the decomposing community gessner et al 2010 land use change and climate change have altered nutrient dynamics throughout the world vitousek et al 1997 rockström et al 2009 ferreira et al 2015 thereby intensifying eutrophication effects on decomposition murdoch et al 2000 the process rate of exo enzymes generally the rate limiting factor in microbial decomposition is strongly determined by the temperature of the environment peterson et al 2007 cunha et al 2010 blagodatskaya et al 2016 global warming of surface waters o reilly et al 2015 has a direct accelerating effect on the decomposition process with up to 80 of decomposition being driven by microbial activity pascoal and cássio 2004 griffiths and tiegs 2016 moreover eutrophication may intensify the effect of global warming on litter decomposition in lakes ferreira and chauvet 2011 of course these drivers do not act in isolation but results from published studies are ambiguous on the combined effect of eutrophication and temperature on decomposition marcarelli and wurtsbaugh 2006 durance and ormerod 2007 ferreira and chauvet 2011 other environmental factors such as detritivore density or litter recalcitrance may also change along a climatic gradient thus confounding results of large scale manipulations ferreira et al 2015 to disentangle the effect of temperature and litter quality on the decomposition process among climate regions a standardized litter is needed keuskamp et al 2013 tiegs et al 2013 1 2 measuring decomposition traditionally both in terrestrial and aquatic environments the decomposition process is studied by using leaf litter packs petersen and cummins 1974 wieder and lang 1982 gessner et al 1999 gulis and suberkropp 2003 prescott 2010 ferreira and chauvet 2011 keuskamp et al 2013 ferreira et al 2015 garcía palacios et al 2016 griffiths and tiegs 2016 bradford et al 2017 when leaf litter enters the environment a leaching event will take place gessner et al 1999 water soluble substances leach from the material while microbes colonize and start to break down the litter macroinvertebrates shred the material by eating both the microbial and leaf biomass after which only the most indigestible part of the leaf material remains and is eventually stored in the sediment or sequestered gessner et al 1999 litter packs capture the integrated result of these processes by their weight loss in time the rate at which mass loss takes place is often approximated by the decomposition constant k 1 value prescott 2010 k estimators have been frequently used to capture differences in decomposition at a temporal or spatial scale and among different sources of litter material gessner et al 1999 hayes and waldbauer 2006 garcía palacios et al 2016 additionally the amount of material which is not broken down by the decomposing community stabilization factor s gives information about the effectiveness of the decomposing community under the current environmental conditions this component of the decomposition process has only been added to decomposition analyses fairly recently harmon et al 2009 the resulting two phase decomposition process provides insight in the carbon burial potential of ecosystems in which decomposition is measured in light of climate change mapping or even exploiting the carbon burying potential of ecosystems might provide an opportunity to minimize the effects of anthropogenic co2 emissions keuskamp et al 2013 1 2 1 the tea bag index to see the effects of environmental factors on the decomposition process a standard uniform litter should be subjected to different levels of the desired factor to be able to accurately assess the impact of these factors the decomposition process has to be mapped across scales thus ecosystems and climate regions and at high spatial resolution the tea bag index tbi is a method designed by keuskamp et al 2013 where lipton tea bags are used as standard leaf litter to determine a decomposition constant k 1 and stabilization factor s by determining the amount of recalcitrant material this stabilization factor is a measure for the effectiveness of the decomposing community under current environmental conditions the tbi was originally designed to provide process driven information on soil functions at local regional and global scales in this study we tested its usefulness in the aquatic environment using a fixed incubation period and two types of tea i e green tea to determine the stabilization factor and rooibos tea to determine the decomposition constant the tbi allowed for modelling of both decomposition rate k 1 as stabilization factor s as it is an affordable easy and fast standardized methodology the tbi allows for decomposition experiments at a much larger scale and offers opportunities for citizen science projects 1 3 opportunities of citizen science while citizen science can refer to the remediation of environmental issues or problems by any action individual or group sivek and hungerford 1990 bonney et al 2009 this definition has been broadened as seen in the 2014 edition of the oxford dictionary scientific work undertaken by members of the general public often in collaboration with or under the direction of professional scientists and scientific institutions in recent years citizen science has received increasing attention from the scientific community as a way to combine outreach to address environmental literacy and as a means of doing scientific research at larger scales e g arslan 2012 henderson et al 2012 frontiers in ecology and the environment special issue citizen science forawi 2016 additionally a call for participatory science has been set out at the governmental level the european water framework directive wfd the european parliament and the council of the european union 2000 underlines the importance of public involvement for the successful integration of sustainable water use to successfully protect the ecological quality of all europe s water the wfd promotes citizens engagement in water quality assessment and solutions encourages water managers to invest in outreach initiatives that deal with water awareness and further collaborations with non government organizations ngos dickinson et al 2012 a standardized affordable method such as the tbi index offers a unique opportunity to collect scientifically robust data while contemporarily addressing environmental issues and increasing scientific literacy of citizen science participants 2 objectives the objectives of our study were twofold 1 to assess the potential of the tea bag index tbi as an standard litter decomposition method for the aquatic environment and 2 to test to what extent large scale trophic state climate zone and small scale patterns lake zone drive decomposition as assessed by tbi methodology to this end a multi lake survey 40 lakes was initiated by a consortium of scientists and citizen scientists working together in eu cost program networking lake observatories in europe eu cost action 1201 netlake 3 material and methods this research consisted of a development phase in which we adapted the terrestrial tbi method to the aquatic environment in the second phase we applied the adapted tbi method to assess decomposition rates in multiple lakes across climate zones and a gradient of trophic states 3 1 developing the tea bag index method in the aquatic environment 3 1 1

05552 5 and 2 5 tetrahedron shaped synthetic tea bags containing rooibos tea lipton pyramid bags ean 87 22700 18843 8 were placed together in the littoral i e on top of the sediment 1 in the pelagic 2 and buried 8 cm in the sediment following standard tbi protocol 3 by placing the tea bags at different position in the lake we aimed to follow the spatial variability in decomposition placing the tea bags 8 cm in the lake sediment coincides with the traditional tbi as it prevents tea bag loss due to predation or scouring but still allows the littoral decomposing community to reach the tea bag the standard retrieval time of the tea bags is approximately 90 days after deployment this time scale was used in upscaling part of this research paragraph 2 3 after the tea bags were retrieved they were gently washed with tap water to remove adhering sediment and macroinvertebrates the tea bags were then air dried for 5 days at room temperature after which the remaining dry weight was determined using the same balances to determine initial weight and weighted to the nearest 0 01 g keuskamp et al 2013 3 1 2 adapting tea bag index method to the aquatic environment because decomposition in aquatic environments entails a much larger leaching effect compared to the terrestrial domain we aimed to add this additional leaching effect to the tbi analyses henceforth we experimentally determined a leaching factor to adapt the tbi method to aquatic environments to this end on 29 april 2016 288 lipton green and rooibos tea bags were placed in the pelagic littoral and buried 8 cm in the sediment of a small pond in wageningen the netherlands wadi 0 03 ha zmax 1 1 m 51 987561 5 670941 we placed the pelagic tea bags on 20 locations in the wadi in which every location differed in water depth thickness of the organic layer and amount of macrophyte growth we placed the tea bags between 10 and 100 cm water depth the littoral ones at a water depth of 30 100 cm and the tea bags in the sediment at 8 cm but with different thickness of the organic matter layer 0 9 cm macrophyte growth ranges from 0 to 60 cover the water temperature ranges from 9 5 c to 14 c during the leaching period a bamboo stick was used to facilitate placement and retrieval of the tea bags the variability of the amount and time frame of the leaching phase in aquatic environments is high france et al 1997 gessner et al 1999 however the tbi uses commercial tea which has been dried for several days before packaging this kills the cells resulting in a loss of structural integrity which facilitates the rapid leaching of soluble components gessner et al 1999 to compensate for initial intense leaching we have estimated leaching over the first 3 h of submersion this period is regarded as a pre conditioning phase to reflect leaching that takes place prior to colonization by microbes and can start relatively fast after entering the system krevš et al 2017 the fraction of weight loss relative to the initial weight of the green tea and rooibos tea bags after 3 h submersion in water was calculated for each zone littoral pelagic and sediment in this time frame microbial decomposition is unlikely to break down detectable amounts of material but leaves sufficient time to capture the period of intense leaching from the tea material differences in intense leaching among tea type and location in the water column zone was tested using a pairwise t test with bonferroni correction this leaching factor was used as a correction factor for the initial tea weight as leaching is not an active part of the decomposition process in further use of the tbi methodology in this paper see below for model calculations 3 1 3 two phase decomposition model with leaching factor decomposition rates and the amount of recalcitrant material i e remaining fraction are estimated using a model in which a two phase decomposition process is assumed as described by wieder and lang 1982 keuskamp et al 2013 eq 1 w t a e k 1 t 1 a in which wt is the remaining mass of leaf litter in grams after the incubation period t in days k 1 is the decomposition rate in day 1 and a is the decomposable fraction function eq 1 was parameterized by fitting the weight losses of both tea types over 4 incubation periods 3 h and 27 89 138 days in the same wadi pond located in wageningen the netherlands from 29 april 2016 until 14 september 2016 in the tbi methodology green and rooibos tea bags from the same location are coupled to recreate this two phase decomposition model using only one incubation period in which rooibos tea allows for estimation of k and green tea for a as established by keuskamp et al 2013 as the decomposition process progresses part of the labile decomposable fraction stabilizes and becomes recalcitrant prescott 2010 this stabilization is conditional on the environment and will thus result in deviations of the actual decomposed fraction a this inhibiting effect of the environment on the decomposition process is captured in the stabilization factor s which is calculated using equation 2 eq 2 s 1 a g h g in which s is the stabilization factor a g is the decomposable fraction and h g is the hydrolysable fraction of green tea a g is determined by dividing the final weight by its initial weight of green tea h g is the sum of the nonpolar extractives water solubles and acid solubles of green tea as determined by keuskamp et al 2013 using a sequential carbon fraction extraction technique by ryan et al 1990 subsequently equation 1 was rewritten to calculate the decomposition constant k 1 using the one time point approach of the tbi methodology for the decomposable fraction a the decomposable fraction of rooibos tea was used a r calculated by multiplying the hydrolysable fraction of rooibos h r by 1 s the leaching factor was used as a correction factor for the initial tea weight by subtracting the multiplication of the initial tea mass times the leaching factor specific for the position of the tea bag in the water column as leaching reduces the initial tea weight it specifically reduces the relative size of the hydrolysable fraction for both green tea and rooibos tea h g and h r therefore we subtracted the specific leaching factor for green tea or rooibos tea from respectively h g and h r and divided this by 1 leaching factor the resulting corrected hydrolysable fraction was thereafter used to calculate the stabilization factor s and decomposition rate k 1 to assess the effect of the inclusion of a leaching factor on our results we compared the results obtained using the leaching factor to the results obtained when using the traditional tbi calculation i e not applying the leaching factor the variance within groups was larger compared to when the leaching factor was used leading to non significant results between groups results not shown available upon request moreover leaching in the aquatic environment plays a larger role compared to the terrestrial ecosystem we therefore recommend not to disregard the leaching factor when deploying the tbi method in the aquatic environment 3 2 scaling up testing large and small scales patterns using citizen science citizen science relies on willing individuals with an interest in their environment lakes and curious about science therefore the lakes were selected based on the following criteria the presence of a citizen scientist teamed up with science partner to ensure quality assurance when collecting data and timely feedback during the sampling period prior limnological knowledge of the lake was considered to be an important factor when choosing among different lakes in a single area additional quality assurance check points in the sampling procedure included standardization of scales used and photographic checks of tea bag placement to ensure standardization of the tbi methodology we trained scientists and citizen scientists during a netlake eu cost action 1201 workshop in the czech republic in 2016 visit http ekolbrno ibot cas cz en 2016 06 20 zprava z training school cost netlake to see the report including photos from this workshop during this workshop the protocols were further fine tuned and a website and facebook group was created after which 25 groups signed up to study a lake for this european wide citizen scientist project six lakes repeated the tbi measurement in 2017 and additional 8 lakes joined in 2017 the results from tbi placement in 7 lakes in 2015 were included bringing the total number of lakes to 40 fig 1 appendix a for the tbi methodology tea bags were weighted to the nearest 0 01 g according to the provided protocol visit www nioo knaw nl netlake citizen science to access the protocols 3 2 1 study sites for citizen science the tbi adapted to the aquatic environment was deployed in 40 lakes across europe in 2015 2017 fig 1 using the köppen geiger climate classification lakes were assigned to their specific climate region rubel and kottek 2010 for the italian lakes the more detailed classification by rubel et al 2017 was used volunteers placed more than 500 tea bag pairs in the littoral pelagic and sediment zones across four köppen geiger climate zones 27 lakes in temperate regions without a dry season köppen geiger climate region cf 3 lakes with a dry summer cs 5 lakes in cold continental regions without a dry season df and 5 lakes in a polar region with a tundra climate et in addition we placed ibutton temperature loggers in the littoral zone in 34 out of the 40 european lakes to be able to assign trophic state to each of the participating lakes volunteers were asked to measure secchi depth using the trophic state index tsi for lakes carlson 1977 secchi depths were converted to a trophic state index using equation 3 eq 3 t s i 10 6 l n s d l n 2 where tsi trophic state index and sd secchi disk depth m a tsi score of above 70 indicates a hypereutrophic lake a score between 50 and 70 is classified as eutrophic between 40 and 50 as mesotrophic and below 40 as oligotrophic in total across our lakes 105 sites were chosen to determine the decomposition rate and stabilization constant of these 105 sites 60 sites were located in the littoral zone 34 sites in the pelagic and 11 sites in the sediment appendix a each site was composed of 2 5 tea bag pairs of the deployed teabags 313 tea bag pairs where used for further analysis causes of exclusion included loss of tea bags due to vandalism or weather conditions or inaccurate final tea weight determination due to trapped macrofauna sediment particles or biofilm formation 3 2 2 data analyses differences in fraction mass loss for green and rooibos tea among climate zones and tsi was tested using an anova modified to use permutation tests instead of normal theory tests aovp this same test was used to determine differences among the decomposition constant k 1 and stabilization factor s between climate regions tsi and position in the water column to avoid pseudoreplication hurlbert 1984 we used lake position in the water column as our experimental unit allowing us to test for differences in decomposition at lake zones across a climatic and trophic gradient as we expected that our unbalanced design could have an effect on the outcome of our analyses we ran a separate analyses where we randomly selected 5 lakes in the cf climatic region temperate climate without a dry season overrepresented in our dataset and all other climate regions were retained in the original sample size all analyses were carried out using r version 3 2 3 with base package stats and the dplyr v0 4 3 lmperm v2 1 0 ggplot2 v2 2 1 and minpack lm v1 2 0 package wickham 2009 elzhov et al 2015 r core team 2015 wickham and francois 2015 wheeler and torchiano 2016 4 results 4 1 developing the tea bag index method for the aquatic environment the average weight loss of tea bags placed in a shallow eutrophic lake for 3 h differed based on the location on average 0 243 mg 0 059 sd of green tea and 0 098 mg 0 030 sd of rooibos tea was leached from the tea bags over the 3 h table 1 additionally the leaching fraction differed significantly between the tea bags placed in the pelagic zone and tea bags placed in the littoral zone or buried 8 cm in the sediment fig 2 p 0 003 water depth macrophyte cover or thickness of the organic matter layer on top of the sediment did not significantly influence the leaching factor to determine the decomposition constant and stabilization factor using the tbi in an aquatic environment this leaching fraction specific for the position of the tea bags in the water column resulting in pelagic littoral and sediment fraction was used to correct the initial tea weight recreating the decomposition dynamics of rooibos and green tea in an aquatic environment required a multi harvest approach as previously described by keuskamp et al 2013 fig 3 green tea decomposed relatively fast and began to level off after 30 60 days depending on the location in the water column rooibos tea decomposed much slower and only started to level off at the end of the experiment 130 days as green tea reached its limit value relatively fast it allowed for estimation of s while rooibos was still being actively decomposed allowing the estimation of k 1 based on these results the tbi incubations for the across site assessment where kept at 90 days similar to the standard tbi protocol for soils 4 2 rolling out to larger scale using citizen science 4 2 1 decomposition constant k1 and stabilization factor s the calculated decomposition constant k 1 and stabilization factor s per lake was compared to the range of k 1 and s as found by keuskamp et al 2013 the values for s found in our experiment ranged from 0 39 to 0 8 average 0 106 0 191 sd the decomposition constant k 1 values calculated in our experiment ranged from 0 00001 to 0 06 day 1 average 0 0078 day 1 0 0067 sd these values are somewhat higher than the ones obtained by keuskamp et al 2013 fig 4 4 2 2 decomposition and spatial variability in lakes we placed tea bags at different positions in the lake i e in the pelagic in the littoral between aquatic plants and buried in the lake sediment to follow different decomposing communities a significant difference was found for relative mass loss of rooibos tea p 0 002 and for the relative mass loss of green tea p 0 001 between the pelagic littoral and sediment in lake zones likewise a significant difference between these positions in the water column was found for the stabilization factor s p 0 042 and for the decomposition constant k 1 p 0 045 4 2 3 climate region after correcting for the overrepresentation of the temperate region without a dry season cf a significant difference among the relative weight loss per rooibos tea bag was found p 0 0001 which resulted in a significant difference for decomposition factor k 1 among climate regions p 0 0007 fig 5 a no significant difference in the rate at which green tea decomposed across the climate regions was found p 0 052 consequently no significant climate region effect in the stabilization factor s p 0 078 was found the temperate regions cf and cs had significantly higher decomposition rates than the cold continental region df and polar region et p 0 05 4 2 4 trophic gradient the trophic state index could not be calculated for 8 of the 40 lakes as no secchi depth was available during the tea bag incubation period twelve oligotrophic and 17 eutrophic lakes were subsampled and tested against 7 mesotrophic lakes per tested parameter hypereutrophic lakes n 2 and lakes where trophic state could not be determined were excluded from the analysis significant differences among trophic state were found in mass loss of rooibos tea p 0 026 and for the decomposition constant k 1 p 0 012 on average a higher decomposition rate was found in eutrophic lakes however the highest decomposition rates were found in an oligotrophic lake p 0 05 additionally a significance difference of mass loss of green tea were found p 0 007 leading to a significant difference for stabilization factor s p 0 004 over trophic states fig 5b eutrophic sites had significantly higher stabilization constants that oligotrophic and mesotrophic sites p 0 05 5 discussion litter decomposition is widely used as an indicator of ecosystem functioning in streams and rivers gessner et al 1997 the weight loss of two tea types a highly standardized litter material was followed in order to determine the suitability for the use of this tea bag methodology tbi in an aquatic environment we introduced the leaching factor to correct for the initial leaching event which plays a much larger role in aquatic decomposition compared to terrestrial decomposition we recommend that this leaching factor should be added to standard tbi methodology to calculate the decomposition constant and stabilization factor in aquatic environments by placing tea bags in 40 lakes across four climate zones and trophic states we show that the tbi with leaching factor adjustment is able to pick up a temperature and eutrophication signal here we offer an extension of the tbi methodology in an effort to create a validated global decomposition map across ecosystems as proposed by keuskamp et al 2013 and garcía palacios et al 2016 5 1 tea bag index the tea bag index tbi methodology is a standardized litter bag experiment to determine terrestrial decomposition similar to those performed since the 1970s winterboum 1978 however the simultaneous use of two tea types used in the current study as well allows for only one time point to calculate decomposition rates this greatly reduces the amount of samples needed and effort required by citizen scientists additionally using the tbi provides not only the traditional decomposition constant k 1 reflecting the decomposition rate but also a stabilization factor s reflecting the amount of material that cannot be broken down this gives additional information about the decomposition curve but also about the amount of the tea material that can be broken down by the microbial community in situ under the present environmental conditions adapting this methodology to aquatic environments creates opportunities to include these ecosystems in global carbon maps and for non experts to contribute to decomposition databases the tbi excludes detrivorous macrofauna that play a role in natural decomposition as they feed not only on the litter itself but also on the fungal mycelium colonizing the litter gessner et al 1999 garcía palacios et al 2016 as with the traditional fine mesh litter bag method by excluding these detritivores their contribution to the decomposition process and rate is not taken into account benfield 2006 as macroinvertebrates are especially sensitive to changes they are likely to be impacted by degradation of their ecosystem quite early on thus effecting the decomposition process early on gessner et al 2010 hodkinson and jackson 2005 if the tbi methodology would be used for the early detection of ecosystem degradation the exclusion of detritivores might lead to an underestimation of k 1 and s however the microbial community can also respond quickly to environmental change as shown by suberkropp and chauvet 1995 where significant changes in microbial decomposition of leaves were seen after 5 days of transferring the leaf material to a stream with contrasting water chemistry the tbi can thus provide a good estimation of the speed k 1 and completeness s of microbial decomposition which is not confounded with detritivore effects other substantial benefits of the tbi are ease of deployment and low costs the use of alien standard litter is necessary to be able to compare decomposition rates k 1 and stabilization factor s across climate zones and trophic states but especially across ecosystems this does not replace the need of decomposition experiments with allochthonous or local autochthonous litter in terrestrial and aquatic systems but rather adds additional information transcending ecosystem boundaries and allowing for global mapping of a key ecosystem process 5 1 1 tea bag index methodology standardization for the aquatic environment the decomposition process in the aquatic environment can be described in three stages leaching conditioning and fragmentation in the decomposition process of tree leaves leaching can take up to 24 h for autumn leaves and up to several days or even weeks for fresh leaves france et al 1997 gessner et al 1999 we defined a leaching period of 3 h sufficient to capture the initial intense leaching of sun dried tea material whitworth et al 2014 the contribution of intense leaching to mass loss in these 3 h differed between lake zones fig 2 stronger contact with water in the pelagic resulted in more pronounced leaching from tea bags placed there compared to tea bags placed in the littoral or in sediment these differences should be and have been taken into account in determining the k 1 and s in each lake zone by measuring weight loss at five different time points we were able to fit a two phase model for decomposition as an independent control of the quality of single point tbi estimations of k 1 and s fig 3 both green tea and rooibos tea decomposition in our lakes followed the same model as in the laboratory dry conditions fig 2 in keuskamp et al 2013 this clearly shows that the tbi can be used to adequately assess the decomposition process in aquatic systems 5 2 factors influencing the decomposition process the rate of terrestrial decomposition is determined by several factors including temperature moisture and ph the quantity and quality of the decomposing material and the microbial community involved in decomposition chapin et al 2002 temperature affects the decomposition process not only by determining the activity of decomposing community but also the leaching stage whitworth et al 2014 looked at the effect of temperature on doc leaching from natural litter after 5 h of incubating sterile litter with nanopure water litter placed at 25 c and 30 c lost roughly double the amount of doc compared to litter that incubated at 5 c 10 c 15 c and 20 c whitworth et al 2014 fig 1 additionally the amount of doc leaching at 5 c 10 c 15 c and 20 c is very similar during the 3 h leaching event in this research the water temperature ranged from 9 5 to 14 c in lake wadi at the start of the european scale tbi experiment the water temperatures ranged from 9 7 c to 25 1 c of our european lakes 19 of the 34 lakes had a start temperature colder than 20 c while 15 have a temperature of above 20 c at the leaching phase for these 15 lakes we might underestimate the weight loss by leaching when using the leaching factor determined in lake wadi according to whitworth et al 2014 however as we have used dried tea leaves as opposed to natural litter material the difference between the amount of leaching at 20 c and 20 c might be less pronounced in aquatic environments as opposed to the terrestrial ecosystem moisture is not a determining factor while oxygen plays a much more important role pascoal and cássio 2004 as oxygen concentrations drop microbial decomposition slows down substantially albeit not coming to a full stop gomes et al 2018 aquatic microbial communities frequently encounter low oxic conditions due to anthropogenic factors such as intensified agriculture resulting in higher nutrient concentrations in waters this stimulates microbial activity depleting oxygen as it is used as the primary electron acceptor during respiration by aerobic organisms in the aquatic environment anaerobic organisms will then take over and will use other electron acceptors such as nitrate and sulfate thus continuing the decomposition process krevš and kučinskienė 2012 these essential environmental differences between terrestrial and aquatic system contributed to the wider range of decomposition rates k 1 and stabilization factors s as found in this study the negative s values that were frequently obtained indicate the net loss of stable compounds a phenomenon not frequently seen in terrestrial deployment of tbi keuskamp et al 2013 the hypothetical un decomposable fraction resulting in s includes not only untransformed material that will not decompose under the current conditions but also stabilized primary and secondary compounds clearly in our lakes the microbial community was able to use one of these compounds for growth thus resulting in negative s values additionally higher decomposition rates k 1 were found in this study compared to keuskamp et al 2013 fig 4 terrestrial decomposition rates can be limited by moisture prescott 2010 for obvious reasons moisture is not a limiting factor in lakes as water is a more permeable environment than soil the tea material could be easier accessible for the microbial community the present lack of comparison between terrestrial versus aquatic decomposition hampers our understanding of this underlying mechanisms governing these differences by disclosing the tbi methodology for the aquatic environment a whole new avenue of comparative research is opened up 5 2 1 climate regions temperature effects on decomposition have been researched extensively in various ecosystems i e zhang et al 2008 griffiths and tiegs 2016 litter decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems k tends to decrease with latitude and increase with temperature and nutrient conditions zhang et al 2008 prescott 2010 the results of our multi lake survey indicated that microbial decomposition rates in lakes in warmer climates are indeed higher than lakes in colder climates this was also found in numerous studies with natural and artificial decomposable material and in other aquatic systems such as streams irons et al 1994 davindson and janssens 2006 boyero et al 2011 aquatic systems are very suitable to assess the impact of climate warming on decomposition as contrary to terrestrial systems moisture availability is not a confounding factor using lakes across latitudinal gradients as surrogates for future temperature changes time for space substitution the effects of climate change on decomposition can be predicted parmesan and yohe 2003 in this study we show that the highly standardized tbi methodology can pick up these effects of climate change using a latitudinal gradient 5 2 2 eutrophication gradient by placing the tbi in lakes across europe we show that the aquatic tbi is able to pick up an eutrophication signal on the in lake decomposition process this confirms our hypothesis that nutrient conditions can greatly influence the decomposition process in a meta analysis of the effect of nutrient addition to in stream decomposition by ferreira et al 2015 nutrients were found to increase the decomposition rate on average by 50 likewise in our study the effect of eutrophication indicated by the trophic state index was found in the decomposition rate k 1 and also in stabilization factor s the occasional high s values found for eutrophic lakes indicate a less efficient microbial community possibly caused by the fact that plenty of decomposable material is present this reduces the need of microbes to decompose the harder more recalcitrant material for growth oligotrophic lakes could have less total litter material available for the decomposing community making them more efficient when breaking down the limited amount of available material overall the variation of s in eutrophic lakes is much higher than for mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes probably due to a cofounding effect with lake zones and climate regions as eutrophication is expected to increase in the future due to increased land use changes population growth and climate change ferreira et al 2015 a better understanding of its effect on ecosystem processes is vital to proper management of water bodies we encountered a high variability within certain trophic states and climate regions and an overrepresentation of certain bins partly a consequence of our citizen science approach nevertheless we were still able to pick up a climate and trophic signal using the tbi for further research a targeted outreach to for instance lake associations and lakeshore inhabitants following a nested sampling design might result in a more evenly distributed dataset and allow deeper analysis of the effects of both climate change and eutrophication on aquatic decompositions additionally the trophic state index based upon a limited number of secchi readings is not ideal to determine the trophic state of a lake for further research the nutrient status of the lakes should be assessed using simple inexpensive kits and or via remote sensing e g shi et al 2018 5 3 opportunity for management the european water framework directive 2000 60 eu wfd has been implemented to restore europe s waters and is the most substantial and ambitious piece of european environmental legislation to date however since its implementation 18 years ago the main goal of good ecological status of all eu waters has not been achieved voulvoulis et al 2017 assign this to the lack of integrated catchment management i e considering the whole system a pre requisite for the effective implementation of the wfd methods such as the tbi can be applied in both terrestrial and aquatic systems to assess a key ecosystem process incorporation of decomposition rates and stabilization factors in standard monitoring regime can be of great use to achieve this shift to more system based approach studying decomposition a fundamental ecological process on the catchment scale can advance integrative water management whilst at the same time contributing to scientific research on a global scale besides achieving a good status for all europe s water the wfd aims to actively involve citizens in the catchment based approach the tbi is highly suitable to combine these goals in one methodology this standardized affordable method offers a unique opportunity to combine the goals of the wfd while simultaneously addressing environmental and scientific literacy 6 conclusions the lack of a standardized litter decomposition method for aquatic vs terrestrial ecosystems is an obstacle for the development of common decomposition models garcía palacios et al 2016 by adding a leaching factor to the tbi methodology currently only validated for terrestrial systems the tbi methodology can be deployed in aquatic systems the tbi methodology can pick up patterns in climate and eutrophication across ecosystems this is a first step in using the tbi in mapping global decomposition patterns in aquatic systems future studies should look at balanced design and more suitable predictor variables temperature oxygen and nutrient concentrations citizen science can contribute to gathering relevant data on ecosystem processes across ecosystems using standardized easy and cheap methodologies

19053,in biological wastewater treatment the bacteria starvation always challenges the stability of system operation yet the effects of starvation and possibility of reactivation are less understood for anaerobic sulfidogenic system sulfidogenic systems use sulfate as electron acceptor for organic chemical oxygen demand cod degradation so it will encounter two kind of starvations i complete stoppage of wastewater flow named complete food starvation and ii remaining organic cod but with very low level sulfate in the influent named sulfate starvation in this study the relative long term starvation over 30 day and subsequent reactivation were studied in two lab scale continuous gas recirculation sulfate reducing upflow sludge bed cgr srusb reactors it was observed that the complete food starvation and sulfate starvation decreased the cod removal rate in the similar range of 60 65 and the specific sulfidogenic activity about 45 and 61 respectively as well as increasing the sludge flotation potential sfp from 15 to 58 and 35 respectively moreover the following restoration experiments proved that the perturbed systems could be reactivated within 10 15 days for both cases the results of investigating the mechanisms showed the performance deterioration were highly attributed to the starvation induced granular sludge transitions with respect to the changing of sludge physico chemical properties permeability porosity hydrophobicity and viscocity and microbial stuctures sulfate reducting bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances the outcomes of this study can provide useful information for dealing with the prolonged starvation problems in sulfidogenesis based systems in industrial and municipal wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords starvation reactivation granular sludge sulfidogenesis sludge flotation 1 introduction the stability of wastewater treatment bioprocesses is always challenged by large fluctuations in the wastewater compositions and flowrate critical operational issues such as the complete stoppage of wastewater inflow and or the lack of an electron donor acceptor in a bio system are widely reported such issues are termed starvation hickey et al 1991 he et al 2015 hwang et al 2010 starvation is commonly caused by various municipal and industrial activities such as annual maintenance seasonal production variations and vacation periods leitão et al 2006 torà et al 2011 jáuregui jáuregui et al 2014 the starvation can lead to various deteriorations to conventional activated sludge cas process such as i biomass

efficient bioprocesses for anaerobic carbon conversion such as methanogenic hwang et al 2010 jáuregui jáuregui et al 2014 and sulfidogenic wu et al 2016 processes are also influenced by starvation perturbations among them the starvation in anaerobic methanogenic bioreactors have been systematically investigated with respects of the effects and possible reasons bae et al 1995 found that biomass specific methanogenic activity decreased by 60 after a starvation period of one month the starved cells consumed extracellular polymeric substance eps as their contingency food which led to an inappropriately low eps to support a compact structure of the methanogenic sludge granules li et al 2006 consequently the starved methnogenic sludge will be bulky with low density resulting in a poor sludge settleability a high potential to entrap gas bubbles leading to sludge flotation hickey et al 1991 kosaric et al 1990 yoda and nishimura 1997 wang et al 2017 however the impact of starvation on sulfidogensis for treating sulfate laden wastewaters lens and kuenen 2001 van loosdrecht et al 2012 wu et al 2016 are not well known in our previous study with full scale biological sulfate reduction reactor for treating seawater flushing saline wastewater in hong kong wu et al 2016 the sulfidogenic activity decreased and sludge flotation were observed when the system encountered two unexpected starvations i e complete food starvation cs and sulfate starvation ss notably the cs is defined as when the wastewater flow stopped completely for ss case wastewater flow and the concentration of cod and ammonia will not change but the sulfate concentration in the wastewater decrease significantly for example from 150 to 50 mg s l leading to a decrease of the cod s ratio from 0 8 to 0 25 g cod g s which is lower than the theoretical stoichiometric value 0 5 g cod g s for sulfate reduction reaction poinapen et al 2009 these starvations in sulfidogenic system critically challenged bioreactor operation to alleviate the problem the detailed investigations on this issue is deemly necessary two granular sludge based continuous gas recirculation cgr srusb reactors wang et al 2018a that had been stably operated over the prior 100 days were used for this study to examine i the impact of both the complete food starvation and sulfate starvation conditions over one month long period and ii the possibility of reactivation from starved perturbation through the experimental investigations the reactor performance including biomass sulfidogenic activity and sludge separation capacity and the physico chemical characteristics of granular sludge as well as the changing of microbial structures were closely monitored the underlying mechansism of starvation and subsequent reactivation is also discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation two 2 4 l identical granular sludge based cgr srusb reactors named as rcs and rss which had been stably operated over 100 days before this study wang et al 2018a were used to investigate the impact of the complete food starvation and sulfate starvation conditions respectively a continuous gas recirculation cgr system with gas flowrate of 3 34 ml min superficial gas velocity of 0 07 m h was equipped in each reactor to provide reactor mixing in the current study rcs and rss were operated in parallel through three consecutive phases phase i iii each with a period of 30 days a normal phase i day 1 30 a starvation phase ii day 31 60 and a reactivation phase iii day 61 90 table 1 on day 1 to ensure that the characteristics of the sludge in rcs and rss were the same at the starting point of the experiment the sludge in the two reactors was taken out evenly mixed and returned to the reactors with the same mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of approximately 8 g lreactor over the following 30 days phase i the two reactors were continuously fed at 1 2 l h hydraulic retention time hrt 2 h with normal synthetic saline sewage containing sulfate organic cod and ammonia nitrogen at concentrations of 500 mg so4 2 mg l i e 166 mg s l 260 mg cod l i e a mixture of acetate and glucose with the cod ratio of 1 1 and 24 mg n l respectively lau et al 2006 detailed information of the preparation of the synthetic sewage is provided in supplementary information si 1 the operating conditions of the two reactors were kept the same during this phase i for details see wang et al 2018a on day 31 the two reactors were switched to starvation conditions phase ii during phase ii the influent flow to rcs was completely stopped to mimic complete food starvation conditions to keep the average shear rate of rcs constant at the suitable level of 4 2 s 1 wang et al 2018a the gas recirculation flow rate was increased from 3 34 ml min to 4 15 ml min in the complete food starvation phase to compensate absence of the part of shear rate originated from the influent liquid flow in the following reactivation phase influent liquid flow was resumed the gas recirculation flow rate was returned to 3 34 ml min in parallel the influent flow to rss was maintained at 1 2 l h but the influent sulfate concentration was decreased from 166 to 50 mg s l to mimic the sulfate starvation conditions from day 61 to day 90 phase iii reactivation phase the operating conditions of the two reactors were returned to those of phase i to examine their performance recovery the performance of the rcs and rss were closely monitored over the 90 days by analyzing i organics conversion performance including cod removal sulfate reduction and sulfide

cxh2xox organics henze et al 2008 mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were measured gravimetrically and dissolved sulfide was measured using the methylene blue method apha 2005 sulfate and other major dissolved ions were determined by ion chromatography shimadzu corporation hic 20a super 2 3 sludge sulfidogenic activity assessment twelve additional batch tests on sludge harvested from each of rcs and rss 3 during phase i 5 during phase 2 and 4 during phase 3 were conducted to elucidate the impact of the starvation conditions on the functional bacteria activities the batch experimental method was modified from hao et al 2016 and the detailed procedure is set out in si 3 in these 6 h batch tests the concentrations of sulfate sulfide and organic cod in the bulk liquid were measured every 0 5 or 1 h the specific removal rate of organic cod srrcod and the specific sulfidogenic activity ssa of the sludges in rcs and rss were calculated as mg cod removed per g mlvss per hour and mg s reduced per g mlvss per hour respectuively considering the shortest duration needed for complete cod removal hao et al 2016 and complete sulfate reaction omil et al 1997 2 4 granular sludge characterization physico chemical properties in this study sludge separation capacity was evaluated with two parameters i e the sludge flotation potential sfp and svi the sfp was measured through an ex situ gas flotation test originated from de beer et al 1996 and halalsheh et al 2005 and the detail procedure is given by wang et al 2018a the svi after 5 and 30 min settling svi5 and svi30 were measured according to standard methods apha 2005 the size distribution of the sludge granules particles was determined with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer horiba la 950v2 sludge surface charge was measured as zeta potential using the brookhaven zetaplus sludge hydrophobicity was measured from the adherence of the sludge to a liquid hydrocarbon p xylene merck rosenberg et al 1980 sludge viscosity was measured with a rotational viscosity meter lichen ndj 5s to evaluate the impact of starvation on the structure of the granular sludge fractal dimension porosity and specific surface area of the sludge were measured using a surface area and pore size analyzer nova 3200e quantachrome instruments microbiological properties the abundance and distribution of srb in the sludge granules were examined through fluorescent in situ hybridization fish techniques visualized with confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm hao et al 2015 wang et al 2018a the representative sludge samples for above tests were taken from rcs and rss on the day 30 normal phase day 60 starvation phase and day 75 reactivation phase the population of srb was quantified as the fluorescing area of cy3 labeled probe srb385 as a percentage of the fluorescing area of fluorescein labeled eub338 total bacteria hagman et al 2008 and the images were processed with imagej http rsb info nih gov ij eps as the major component of the sludge was also investigated in this study the eps was extraction using the methods described in li and yang 2007 the effect of starvation on the eps chemical composition was explored through excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy f 4500 hitachi analysis following the method described in jia et al 2016 the change in eps was further quantified for i the types of eps as loosely bound lb eps and tightly bound tb eps and ii the composition of eps as proteins pn polysaccharides ps and humic like substances hs which were analyzed according to wang et al 2018a 2 5 statistical analysis an f test is widely applied to test if the variances of two sets of data are equal snedecor and cochran 1989 in order to statistically validate the difference of reactor performance between the normal phase and starvation phase we conducted f test for the experimental data of each parameter with microsoft excel in each f test the data of a specific parameter was separated into two groups i e normal phase group data obtained from day 1 30 and starvation phase group data obtained from day 30 60 the two groups of data were inputted to the f test analysis in microsoft excel then an f value and an f critical value fcritical were obtained in the output of the f test analysis when the f value is greater than the fcritical value we reject the null hypothesis i e the variances of two groups of data are equal which suggests the values of the specific parameter are different during normal phase and starvation phase when the f value is smaller than the fcritical value we don t reject the null hypothesis which suggests that we cannot tell from the f test that the values of the specific parameter are significantly different during normal phase and starvation phase 3 results and discussion 3 1 system performance 3 1 1 effect on reactor performance fig 1 a d shows the biological conversion performance with respect to organic cod removal sulfate reduction sulphide production and sludge concentrations of rcs and rss which were monitored on a weekly basis during the three phases in phase i normal operation the cod removal efficiencies of rcs and rss were both over 90 and the sulfide concentrations in the effluents of the two reactors remained in a range of 97 111 mg s l the δcod δs ratios in the two reactors were stable between 1 7 and 2 4 g δcod g s and close to the theoretical stoichiometric ratio of 2 g δcod g s which indicated that a highly efficient cod removal was achieved through the sulfate reduction pathway poinapen et al 2009 these phase i results established a good evaluation baseline for the comparison of the starvation and reactivation performances in phases ii and iii in phase ii although the influent flow of the rcs was completely stopped the biological reactions did not completely stop the sulfide concentration in the bulk liquid increased from 107 to 210 mg s l fig 1a the difference of sulfide concentration between normal phase and starvation was also validated in the statistical analysis f test i e the f value of 62 67 is greater than the fcritical of 6 39 the null hypothesis i e the variances of the sulfide concentration data in the normal phase and that in the starvation are equal was rejected more detail was provided in si 6 and supplementary table s2 the increase of sulfide concentration in the bulk liquid may due to cell lysis and release of the stored poly sulfide elemental sulfur guo et al 2016 consequently the sulfide concentration kept increasing to a level higher than the influent sulfate concentration i e 166 s l concomitantly the soluble total nitrogen soluble tn mainly ammonia concentration in the bulk liquid increased from 22 2 to 93 4 mg n l fig 1c f fcritical table s2 and the mlss and mlvss gradually decreased from 8 1 0 5 to 7 3 0 3 g mlss l and 5 1 0 4 to 4 4 0 3 g mlvss l respectivley and the ratio of mlvss mlss decreased slightly from 63 1 to 60 2 these results imply that the sludge decomposed under the complete food starvation condition and the decomposed sludge as particulate cod was utilized by srb for sultate reduction resulting in the increased sulfide concentration a similar phenomenon of sludge decomposition was also reported in methanogenic manariotis and grigoropoulos 2008 anammox xing et al 2016 wang et al 2018b and activated sludge systems yilmaz et al 2007 under starvation conditions the sludge decomposition can cause the deterioration of the sludge granules lopez et al 2006 van loosdrecht and henze 1999 resulting in the reduction of active biomass and variation in sludge characteristics details discussed below in rss under sulfate starvation conditions decreased influent sulfate from 166 to 50 mg s l the sulfate starvation condition caused a shock impact on the biological conversion fig 1b i e the cod removal efficiency decreased sharply from 92 to 27 in the first 5 days of phase ii i e day 31 to day 35 then increased slightly to 44 in the following 25 days f fcritical table s2 correspondingly the δcod δs ratio sharply decreased from 2 13 to 1 47 g δcod g s in the first 5 days then gradually increased to 4 86 g δcod g s in the following 25 days f fcritical table s2 the increased δcod δso4 s ratio suggests that the percentage of cod removed by sulfate reduction was decreased and some other anaerobic organics removal reactions e g methanogenesis occurred the shift of biopathway from sulfidogensis to methanogensis were not examined but is worthy of further investigation in rss the mlss and mlvss of sludge and the soluble tn concentration in the bulk liquid remained stable at 8 0 0 1 8 3 0 2 g mlss l 4 9 0 2 5 3 0 2 g mlvss l and 21 0 3 27 0 2 mg n l respectively fig 1d this indicates there was no apparent biomass reduction during the sulfate starvation period but the sulfidogensis activity and the physico chemical and stuctures of granular sludge were obviously affected by the sulfate starvation details discussed below in phase iii when the influent flow and wastewater compositions to both rcs and rss were restored to the normal phase i operating conditions the reactivation of the biological conversion was achieved in a short period of 10 15 days for example in rcs full recovery was achieved within 10 days i e the cod removal efficiency increased from 20 at day 60 under complete food starvation to around 90 at day 70 sulfide concentration in the effluent increased to over 100 mg s l and the δcod δ s ratio returned back to its theoretical stoichiometric value of 2 similarly the full recovery time of rss was approximately 15 days which is slightly longer than that of rcs nevertheless the overall the 10 15 days reactivation for sulfidogenic systems are clearly faster than that of methanogenic systems which need at least 28 days as reported in jáuregui jáuregui et al 2014 bae et al 1995 and manariotis and grigoropoulos 2008 but much slower than that of aerobic activated sludge system 5 days torà et al 2011 yilmaz et al 2007 these results on sulfidogenic system recovery are useful for scale up application 3 1 2 effect on sulfidogenic activity and srb populations specific biomass activites two parameters are generally used to evaluate the sulfidogenic biomass activities i e the specific removal rate of cod srrcod and specific sulfidogenic activity ssa omil et al 1997 greben et al 2000 hao et al 2016 these parameters were measured by conducting batch tests every 5 7 days with the biomass harvested from rcs and rss the obtained experimental data is plotted in the supplementary fig 1 fig s1 and the calculated specific rates are summarized in table 2 in the normal phase i the srrcod and ssa of rcs and rss were maintained at relatively high levels of 35 38 mg cod g vss h and 13 16 mg s reduced g vss h these values serve as the control baseline for comparison during the starvation phase ii both the complete food starvation and sulfate starvation had strong negative effects on the sulfidogenic biomass activities under complete food starvation the srrcod and ssa of the biomass in rcs gradually decreased from 34 6 to 13 4 mg cod g vss h and from 12 5 to 6 9 mg s reduced g vss h respectively over 25 days f fcritical table s2 comparatively the srrcod and ssa of the rss biomass decreased from 34 4 to 12 1 cod g vss h and from 12 5 to 4 9 mg s reduced g vss h respectively from day 31 to day 45 and then these low biomass activities remained unchanged until day 60 f fcritical table s2 thus the sulfate starvation condition caused a faster and larger reduction in the biomass sulfidogenic activity than the complete food starvation the srrcod and ssa of rcs recovered to normal levels within 10 days before day 70 while for rss it took 15 days to recover hence the time needed for the full recovery of the specific sulfidogenic activites under the two conditions coincided with reactor performance restoration this reactivation is in agreement with the observations of hao et al 2016 and lens and kuenen 2001 suggesting that sulfate reducing bacteria have strong resilience to unfavorable conditions srb population fish based microbiological analytical techniques were applied to visualize the effect of starvation on the abundance and distribution of srb in the sludge granules fig 2 the granules of rcs and rss at day 30 60 and 75 representing normal starvation and reactivation phases were examined for the granules taken from the rcs fig 2a and rss fig 2b at day 30 the total bacteria blue and srb green are evenly distributed and highly overlapping which indicates as expected that srb are prevalent in the granular sludge under normal conditions high srb to total bacteria ratios of 52 7 in rcs granules and 56 6 in rss granules were obtained by analyzing the fluorescing intensities of srb and total bacteria in fig 2a and b respectively with imagej after 30 days of starvation at day 60 the srb to total bacteria ratio of the rcs granules decreased to 46 2 fig 2c and of the rss granules to 40 3 fig 2d under complete food starvation and sulfate starvation respectively this indicates that both the two starvation conditions were the cause of the decrease of srb abundance in the granules and consequently reduced their sulfidogenic biomass activity and that sulfate starvation caused a larger impact this is consisten with the larger deterioration of sulfidogenic biomass activity in the sulfate starved rss as mentioned above from day 75 15 days into the reactivation phase iii intense and homogeneously distributed fluorescence signals of both total bacteria and srb are again observed in the granules fig 2e and f the restoration of the srb population is coincident with the full recovery of sulfidogenic activity and was confirmed in the batch tests mentioned above si 3 3 1 3 effect on sludge separation capacity sludge solid liquid separation measured in terms svi5 and svi30 and sludge flotation potential sfp is important for bioreactor stable operation henze et al 2008 jenkins et al 2003 the changes in svi and sfp in rcs and rss over the three experimental phases are shown in fig 1e and f sludge settling in the normal phase i the svi5 and svi5 svi30 ratio of rcs and rss sludges remained stable in the low range of 34 4 to 41 3 ml g and 1 0 0 06 to 1 2 0 02 respectively the svi5 of the granular sludge was lower than the critical value 40 60 ml g for typical granular sludge henze et al 2008 and the low svi5 svi30 ratio indicated that excellent settleability of the granular sludge was maintained in both reactors schwarzenbeck et al 2005 then in rcs under complete food starvation the svi5 and svi5 svi30 increased sharply over day 40 60 from 30 3 to 92 3 ml g and 1 1 0 09 to 2 5 0 08 respectively indicating the sludge settleability deteriorated markedly f fcritical table s2 this poor sludge settleability resulting from complete food starvation in rcs required approximately 15 days day 61 to day 75 to recover to its normal operation levels in the reactivation phase in contrast sulfate starvation had a low impact on sludge settleability the svi5 of the rss sludge only slightly increased from 36 6 to 45 3 ml g during the whole 30 day sulfate starvation phase and then recovered to the pre starvation level around 35 ml g within 5 days of reactivation similarly the svi5 svi30 ratio in rss was not significantly influenced by the sulfate starvation and remained stable in a range of 1 1 0 02 to 1 3 0 13 throughout the sulfate starvation and following reactivation phases sludge flotation sfp is another important parameter for assessing the solid liquid separation capacity of sludge de beer et al 1996 wang et al 2017 the sfp of both rcs and rss was maintained below the critical safe value of 20 halalsheh et al 2005 in the normal phase fig 1f at the end of the starvation phase ii on day 60 the sfp of rcs had increased to a high level of 58 1 while the sfp of rss increased less to only 35 1 the sfp of rcs is approximately 1 7 times of the sfp of rss at the end of the starvation phase f fcritical table s2 these results suggest that i both complete and sulfate starvation conditions could trigger sludge flotation problems in sulfidogenic sludge systems and ii comparatively sulfidogenic sludges suffering from complete food starvation was more likely to float than sludge suffering from the sulfate starvation over the same time period this observations in rcs and rss are in agreement with the findings in starvation studies on methanogenic and anammox reactors in which the granular sludges tend to float after a prolonged period of starvation or storage kosaric et al 1990 bae et al 1995 xing et al 2016 nevertheless the critical value of sfp 20 could be regained within 15 and 10 days in the rcs and rss respectively fig 1f 3 2 granular sludge transformation 3 2 1 effect on physical structure aspects of the physical structure of sludge granules such as morphology permeability and porosity are believed to be closely related to the mass transfer of the granules lemaire et al 2008 di iaconi et al 2006 and sludge liquid separation capacity xing et al 2016 hence the morphology fractal dimension bet surface area total pore volume and average pore size of the sludge granules were measured to investigate the effects of the starvation conditions on the sludge s physical structure as well as attempting to further explain their relationship with reactor performance morphology during the normal phase i sludge granules with clear boundaries semi spherical shape and compact inner structure were observed in rcs fig 2a and rss fig 2b afterward during the complete food starved phase ii the rcs granules adopted a loose structure with dispersed boundaries fig 2c the structural deterioration might be related to the cell lysis caused by the complete absence of electron donor cod and electron acceptor so4 2 in contrast the rss granules subjected to sulfate starvation maintained a semi spherical morphology but hollow spaces were formed fig 4d both the loose structure in the rcs granules and the hollow spaces in the rss granules are unfavorable factors that tend to decrease the sludge density and increase the potential of gas entrapment campos et al 2017 bae et al 1995 and hence increases the potential of sludge flotation permeability the fractal dimension of granular sludge is widely used to evaluate the permeability of sludge granules a high fractal dimension suggests a high permeability bellouti et al 1997 mu et al 2006 fig 3 a shows that the fractal dimension of rcs granules clearly decreased from 3 35 0 28 at day 29 to 2 13 0 15 at day 60 after 30 days of complete food starvation in contrast the sulfate starvation had no significant effect on the fractal dimension of the rss granules which remained stable at around 3 3 f fcritical table s2 as the fractal dimension is positively correlated with the efficiency of mass transfer between the bulk liquid and granules bellouti et al 1997 qian et al 2017 the decrease of the fractal dimension in this study suggested that the permeability i e mass transfer efficiency of the sulfidogenic granules in rcs was significantly reduced by the complete food starvation porosity the porosity of the sludge granules was evaluated by bet surface area total pore volume and average pore size for rcs sludge during the complete food starvation the bet surface area decreased from 4 76 0 05 to 3 91 0 07 m2 g fig 3b the total pore volume clearly decreased from 0 021 0 01 to 0 013 0 03 ml g fig 3c and the average pore size also clearly decreased from 54 4 6 0 to 32 6 1 4 nm fig 3d f fcritical table s2 for rss sludge during the sulfate starvation phase the bet surface area only slightly decreased from 4 61 0 03 to 4 01 0 08 m2 g fig 3b but the total pore volume and average pore size clearly increased from 0 018 0 03 to 0 028 0 03 ml g fig 3c and 46 3 1 4 to 55 9 5 4 nm fig 3d respectively f fcritical table s2 the porosity results measured in this study were close to the values reported by hao et al 2015 who measured the bet surface area and total pore volume in their sulfidogenic granular sludge to be 3 3 4 1 m2 g and 0 019 0 025 ml g respectively the increasing trend of the total pore volume and average pore size during the sulfate starvation in rss which is the opposite of the decreasing trend in complete food starvation in rcs is consistent with the formation of hollow spaces in the rss granules as observed in fig 2d 3 2 2 effect on chemical properties the chemical properties of granular sludge such as lb tb eps mg toc g vss and the chemical composition of eps proteins humic acid and polysaccharides as well as the sludge surface properties hydrophobicity and viscocity were measured to investigate the transformation of sulfidogenic granular sludge under starvation conditions lb tb eps the eps composition in terms of lb eps and tb eps in the sludge of rcs and rss remained stable in a narrow range during the normal phase i day 1 30 between 3 0 1 5 to 4 9 0 6 mg toc g vss and 24 2 to 30 3 mg toc g vss respectively and the ratio of lb eps to tb eps was constant at a relatively low level between 0 11 0 02 to 0 17 0 03 g lb eps g tb eps during complete food starvation from day 31 to day 60 large transitions took place in the characteristics of the sludge eps in rcs gradually the lb eps increased to 11 1 mg toc g vss the tb eps decreased to 17 2 mg toc g vss and the lb eps tb eps ratio increased to a high level of 0 63 0 1 which was approximately 6 times the lb eps tb eps ratio during the normal phase fig 4a f fcritical table s2 in contrast the impact of the sulfate starvation on the sludge eps of rss was not as large as that caused in rcs as shown in fig 4b the lb eps and tb eps showed little change also the trends of eps changes observed in the rcs and rss sludges were different probably due to the availability of organic cod to rss the srb under complete food starvation in rcs had no external carbon energy source and the eps was quickly consumed sheng et al 2010 in contrast the eps was consumed more slowly in rss under the sulfate starvation condition because the influent with cod and other nutrients n p k was continuously provided during the sulfate starvation phase although the total eps decreased in both rss and in rcs the lb eps increased in both perhaps because the microbes in harsh environments increased their production of lb eps to protect themselves from impairment franco et al 2006 xing et al 2015 the increase in lb eps and decrease in tb eps as caused by the starvation conditions in this study might lead the sludge granules to be less compact and more adhesive to nearby biogas bubbles resulting in poor settleability and high potential for sludge flotation sheng et al 2010 wang et al 2018a chemical properties three major categories of eps chemical components including the protein like tyrosine amino acid substances the soluble microbial by products like substances a mixture of protein like and humic like substances and the humic like substances were detected from the extracted eps samples from both rcs and rss via eem fluorescence analysis fig 5 chen et al 2003 more detailed information was provided in si 4 from comparison of the fluorescence intensities complete food starvation changed the eps chemical characteristics more significantly than the sulfate starvation by reducing the concentrations of the protein like components in the eps and altering their ratio table s1 furthermore the proteins pn humic acid hs and polysaccharides ps were measured in the eps extracts the results show that in the normal phase pn ps and the pn ps ratio remained stable in rcs and rss between 72 and 102 mg g vss 26 41 mg g vss and 2 3 to 3 8 respectively fig 4c and d under complete food starvation of rcs the pn decreased slightly to 54 4 mg g vss and the ps decreased substantially to 11 1 mg g vss these changes led to the pn ps ratio increasing to a high value of 4 8 0 4 fig 4c f fcritical table s2 comparatively the eps composition in rss fig 4d did not change as much as the eps in rcs as shown in fig 4d in the literature the pn ps ratio of eps is documented as a good indicator of the granule settleability su and yu 2005 franco et al 2006 and possibly also of sludge flotation cuervo lópez et al 1999 li et al 2014 the typical pn ps ratio of normal sulfidogenic granules ranges from 1 0 to 4 0 hao et al 2016 tsui et al 2016 wang et al 2018a in the present study the maximum pn ps ratios of the rcs and rss during their starvation phases were 6 5 0 2 and 3 9 0 3 respectively complete food starvation resulted in a pn ps ratio over the critical value of 5 and higher than the normal ranges of stable sulfidogenic sludge but sulfate starvation did not additionally as shown in fig s2 increases of hydrophobicity and viscosity and a decrease in negative surface charge of the sludge were caused by the two starvation conditions detail in si 5 these changes point to the sludge granules becoming more adhesive to gas bubbles wang et al 2018a these unfavorable transitions induced by the starvation conditions therefore could stimulate gas bubble entrapment in the sludge granules thereby reducing sludge liquid separation efficiency 4 conclusions the performance of the cgr srusb was tested under two realistic operational malfunctions for 30 days i the complete stoppage of wastewater complete food starvation and ii the decrease of the influent sulfate concentration to a very low level sulfate starvation the following conclusions are drawn the biological conversion capability of the sulfidogenic sludge decreased substantially during the starvation conditions approximately 61 and 65 reductions of the specific removal rate of organic cod and 45 and 61 reductions of the specific sulfidogenic activity of the sulfidogenic granules were observed after 30 days of complete food starvation and sulfate starvation respectively sulfate starvation had a larger impact on biological conversion sludge solid liquid separation efficiency deteriorated significantly during both of the starvation conditions i the svi5 svi30 ratio increased from 1 1 to 2 5 and from 1 1 to 1 3 and ii the sludge flotation potential increased from below 20 critical safe value to 58 and 35 after the 30 days of complete food starvation and sulfate starvation respectively complete food starvation exerted a larger impact on solid liquid separation the starvation conditions especially complete food starvation led to i deterioration of the structural and chemical characteristics of the sludge eps as measured by an increase the lb eps tb eps ratio to 0 63 0 1 and the pn ps ratio to 6 5 0 2 ii unfavorable changes in the sludge surface adhesive properties by increasing hydrophobicity to 55 5 increasing viscosity to 2 8 0 07 mpa s and weakening surface charge to 16 4 mv and iii alteration of the sludge s physical structure by decreasing permeability and porosity promoting the formation of inner hollow spaces these unfavorable changes tend to increase gas sludge entrapment and decrease granule density thereby decreasing solid liquid separation efficiency and increasing sludge flotqtioon potential the overall performance of the two starved cgr srusb reactors was quickly recovered after 10 15 days of reactivation operation this satisfactory reactivation performance reflected the high resilience of the newly designed cgr srusb reactors declarations of interest none acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the

19053,in biological wastewater treatment the bacteria starvation always challenges the stability of system operation yet the effects of starvation and possibility of reactivation are less understood for anaerobic sulfidogenic system sulfidogenic systems use sulfate as electron acceptor for organic chemical oxygen demand cod degradation so it will encounter two kind of starvations i complete stoppage of wastewater flow named complete food starvation and ii remaining organic cod but with very low level sulfate in the influent named sulfate starvation in this study the relative long term starvation over 30 day and subsequent reactivation were studied in two lab scale continuous gas recirculation sulfate reducing upflow sludge bed cgr srusb reactors it was observed that the complete food starvation and sulfate starvation decreased the cod removal rate in the similar range of 60 65 and the specific sulfidogenic activity about 45 and 61 respectively as well as increasing the sludge flotation potential sfp from 15 to 58 and 35 respectively moreover the following restoration experiments proved that the perturbed systems could be reactivated within 10 15 days for both cases the results of investigating the mechanisms showed the performance deterioration were highly attributed to the starvation induced granular sludge transitions with respect to the changing of sludge physico chemical properties permeability porosity hydrophobicity and viscocity and microbial stuctures sulfate reducting bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances the outcomes of this study can provide useful information for dealing with the prolonged starvation problems in sulfidogenesis based systems in industrial and municipal wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords starvation reactivation granular sludge sulfidogenesis sludge flotation 1 introduction the stability of wastewater treatment bioprocesses is always challenged by large fluctuations in the wastewater compositions and flowrate critical operational issues such as the complete stoppage of wastewater inflow and or the lack of an electron donor acceptor in a bio system are widely reported such issues are termed starvation hickey et al 1991 he et al 2015 hwang et al 2010 starvation is commonly caused by various municipal and industrial activities such as annual maintenance seasonal production variations and vacation periods leitão et al 2006 torà et al 2011 jáuregui jáuregui et al 2014 the starvation can lead to various deteriorations to conventional activated sludge cas process such as i biomass activity reduction show et al 2012 yilmaz et al 2007 ii sludge bed clogging damianovic et al 2016 iii poor sludge settleability and the sludge flotation problem kosaric et al 1990 bae et al 1995 iv cell lysis and reduced flocs granules compactness torà et al 2011 show et al 2012 wang et al 2018b v unfavorable changes in sludge physicochemical characteristics wang et al 2005 and vi transitions in the microbial population and metabolic pathway de jonge et al 2017 moreover the cas based bio system reactivation from the deteriorations is also under challenges yilmaz et al 2007 the energy efficient bioprocesses for anaerobic carbon conversion such as methanogenic hwang et al 2010 jáuregui jáuregui et al 2014 and sulfidogenic wu et al 2016 processes are also influenced by starvation perturbations among them the starvation in anaerobic methanogenic bioreactors have been systematically investigated with respects of the effects and possible reasons bae et al 1995 found that biomass specific methanogenic activity decreased by 60 after a starvation period of one month the starved cells consumed extracellular polymeric substance eps as their contingency food which led to an inappropriately low eps to support a compact structure of the methanogenic sludge granules li et al 2006 consequently the starved methnogenic sludge will be bulky with low density resulting in a poor sludge settleability a high potential to entrap gas bubbles leading to sludge flotation hickey et al 1991 kosaric et al 1990 yoda and nishimura 1997 wang et al 2017 however the impact of starvation on sulfidogensis for treating sulfate laden wastewaters lens and kuenen 2001 van loosdrecht et al 2012 wu et al 2016 are not well known in our previous study with full scale biological sulfate reduction reactor for treating seawater flushing saline wastewater in hong kong wu et al 2016 the sulfidogenic activity decreased and sludge flotation were observed when the system encountered two unexpected starvations i e complete food starvation cs and sulfate starvation ss notably the cs is defined as when the wastewater flow stopped completely for ss case wastewater flow and the concentration of cod and ammonia will not change but the sulfate concentration in the wastewater decrease significantly for example from 150 to 50 mg s l leading to a decrease of the cod s ratio from 0 8 to 0 25 g cod g s which is lower than the theoretical stoichiometric value 0 5 g cod g s for sulfate reduction reaction poinapen et al 2009 these starvations in sulfidogenic system critically challenged bioreactor operation to alleviate the problem the detailed investigations on this issue is deemly necessary two granular sludge based continuous gas recirculation cgr srusb reactors wang et al 2018a that had been stably operated over the prior 100 days were used for this study to examine i the impact of both the complete food starvation and sulfate starvation conditions over one month long period and ii the possibility of reactivation from starved perturbation through the experimental investigations the reactor performance including biomass sulfidogenic activity and sludge separation capacity and the physico chemical characteristics of granular sludge as well as the changing of microbial structures were closely monitored the underlying mechansism of starvation and subsequent reactivation is also discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation two 2 4 l identical granular sludge based cgr srusb reactors named as rcs and rss which had been stably operated over 100 days before this study wang et al 2018a were used to investigate the impact of the complete food starvation and sulfate starvation conditions respectively a continuous gas recirculation cgr system with gas flowrate of 3 34 ml min superficial gas velocity of 0 07 m h was equipped in each reactor to provide reactor mixing in the current study rcs and rss were operated in parallel through three consecutive phases phase i iii each with a period of 30 days a normal phase i day 1 30 a starvation phase ii day 31 60 and a reactivation phase iii day 61 90 table 1 on day 1 to ensure that the characteristics of the sludge in rcs and rss were the same at the starting point of the experiment the sludge in the two reactors was taken out evenly mixed and returned to the reactors with the same mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of approximately 8 g lreactor over the following 30 days phase i the two reactors were continuously fed at 1 2 l h hydraulic retention time hrt 2 h with normal synthetic saline sewage containing sulfate organic cod and ammonia nitrogen at concentrations of 500 mg so4 2 mg l i e 166 mg s l 260 mg cod l i e a mixture of acetate and glucose with the cod ratio of 1 1 and 24 mg n l respectively lau et al 2006 detailed information of the preparation of the synthetic sewage is provided in supplementary information si 1 the operating conditions of the two reactors were kept the same during this phase i for details see wang et al 2018a on day 31 the two reactors were switched to starvation conditions phase ii during phase ii the influent flow to rcs was completely stopped to mimic complete food starvation conditions to keep the average shear rate of rcs constant at the suitable level of 4 2 s 1 wang et al 2018a the gas recirculation flow rate was increased from 3 34 ml min to 4 15 ml min in the complete food starvation phase to compensate absence of the part of shear rate originated from the influent liquid flow in the following reactivation phase influent liquid flow was resumed the gas recirculation flow rate was returned to 3 34 ml min in parallel the influent flow to rss was maintained at 1 2 l h but the influent sulfate concentration was decreased from 166 to 50 mg s l to mimic the sulfate starvation conditions from day 61 to day 90 phase iii reactivation phase the operating conditions of the two reactors were returned to those of phase i to examine their performance recovery the performance of the rcs and rss were closely monitored over the 90 days by analyzing i organics conversion performance including cod removal sulfate reduction and sulfide production rates ii biomass sulfidogenic activity via sulfidogenic activity batch tests iii the abundance and distribution of sulfate reducing bacteria srb in the granular sludge iv sludge solid

sulfide in the saline wastewater it was determined by multiplying the measured value of the total organic carbon toc shimadzu toc l by the theoretical cod toc conversion factor of 2 67 gcod gtoc for cxh2xox organics henze et al 2008 mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were measured gravimetrically and dissolved sulfide was measured using the methylene blue method apha 2005 sulfate and other major dissolved ions were determined by ion chromatography shimadzu corporation hic 20a super 2 3 sludge sulfidogenic activity assessment twelve additional batch tests on sludge harvested from each of rcs and rss 3 during phase i 5 during phase 2 and 4 during phase 3 were conducted to elucidate the impact of the starvation conditions on the functional bacteria activities the batch experimental method was modified from hao et al 2016 and the detailed procedure is set out in si 3 in these 6 h batch tests the concentrations of sulfate sulfide and organic cod in the bulk liquid were measured every 0 5 or 1 h the specific removal rate of organic cod srrcod and the specific sulfidogenic activity ssa of the sludges in rcs and rss were calculated as mg cod removed per g mlvss per hour and mg s reduced per g mlvss per hour respectuively considering the shortest duration needed for complete cod removal hao et al 2016 and complete sulfate reaction omil et al 1997 2 4 granular sludge characterization physico chemical properties in this study sludge separation capacity was evaluated with two parameters i e the sludge flotation potential sfp and svi the sfp was measured through an ex situ gas flotation test originated from de beer et al 1996 and halalsheh et al 2005 and the detail procedure is given by wang et al 2018a the svi after 5 and 30 min settling svi5 and svi30 were measured according to standard methods apha 2005 the size distribution of the sludge granules particles was determined with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer horiba la 950v2 sludge surface charge was measured as zeta potential using the brookhaven zetaplus sludge hydrophobicity was measured from the adherence of the sludge to a liquid hydrocarbon p xylene merck rosenberg et al 1980 sludge viscosity was measured with a rotational viscosity meter lichen ndj 5s to evaluate the impact of starvation on the structure of the granular sludge fractal dimension porosity and specific surface area of the sludge were measured using a surface area and pore size analyzer nova 3200e quantachrome instruments microbiological properties the abundance and distribution of srb in the sludge granules were examined through fluorescent in situ hybridization fish techniques visualized with confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm hao et al 2015 wang et al 2018a the representative sludge samples for above tests were taken from rcs and rss on the day 30 normal phase day 60 starvation phase and day 75 reactivation phase the population of srb was quantified as the fluorescing area of cy3 labeled probe srb385 as a percentage of the fluorescing area of fluorescein labeled eub338 total bacteria hagman et al 2008 and the images were processed with imagej http rsb info nih gov ij eps as the major component of the sludge was also investigated in this study the eps was extraction using the methods described in li and yang 2007 the effect of starvation on the eps chemical composition was explored through excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy f 4500 hitachi analysis following the method described in jia et al 2016 the change in eps was further quantified for i the types of eps as loosely bound lb eps and tightly bound tb eps and ii the composition of eps as proteins pn polysaccharides ps and humic like substances hs which were analyzed according to wang et al 2018a 2 5 statistical analysis an f test is widely applied to test if the variances of two sets of data are equal snedecor and cochran 1989 in order to statistically validate the difference of reactor performance between the normal phase and starvation phase we conducted f test for the experimental data of each parameter with microsoft excel in each f test the data of a specific parameter was separated into two groups i e normal phase group data obtained from day 1 30 and starvation phase group data obtained from day 30 60 the two groups of data were inputted to the f test analysis in microsoft excel then an f value and an f critical value fcritical were obtained in the output of the f test analysis when the f value is greater than the fcritical value we reject the null hypothesis i e the variances of two groups of data are equal which suggests the values of the specific parameter are different during normal phase and starvation phase when the f value is smaller than the fcritical value we don t reject the null hypothesis which suggests that we cannot tell from the f test that the values of the specific parameter are significantly different during normal phase and starvation phase 3 results and discussion 3 1 system performance 3 1 1 effect on reactor performance fig 1 a d shows the biological conversion performance with respect to organic cod removal sulfate reduction sulphide production and sludge concentrations of rcs and rss which were monitored on a weekly basis during the three phases in phase i normal operation the cod removal efficiencies of rcs and rss were both over 90 and the sulfide concentrations in the effluents of the two reactors remained in a range of 97 111 mg s l the δcod δs ratios in the two reactors were stable between 1 7 and 2 4 g δcod g s and close to the theoretical stoichiometric ratio of 2 g δcod g s which indicated that a highly efficient cod removal was achieved through the sulfate reduction pathway poinapen et al 2009 these phase i results established a good evaluation baseline for the comparison of the starvation and reactivation performances in phases ii and iii in phase ii although the influent flow of the rcs was completely stopped the biological reactions did not completely stop the sulfide concentration in the bulk liquid increased from 107 to 210 mg s l fig 1a the difference of sulfide concentration between normal phase and starvation was also validated in the statistical analysis f test i e the f value of 62 67 is greater than the fcritical of 6 39 the null hypothesis i e the variances of the sulfide concentration data in the normal phase and that in the starvation are equal was rejected more detail was provided in si 6 and supplementary table s2 the increase of sulfide concentration in the bulk liquid may due to cell lysis and release of the stored poly sulfide elemental sulfur guo et al 2016 consequently the sulfide concentration kept increasing to a level higher than the influent sulfate concentration i e 166 s l concomitantly the soluble total nitrogen soluble tn mainly ammonia concentration in the bulk liquid increased from 22 2 to 93 4 mg n l fig 1c f fcritical table s2 and the mlss and mlvss gradually decreased from 8 1 0 5 to 7 3 0 3 g mlss l and 5 1 0 4 to 4 4 0 3 g mlvss l respectivley and the ratio of mlvss mlss decreased slightly from 63 1 to 60 2 these results imply that the sludge decomposed under the complete food starvation condition and the decomposed sludge as particulate cod was utilized by srb for sultate reduction resulting in the increased sulfide concentration a similar phenomenon of sludge decomposition was also reported in methanogenic manariotis and grigoropoulos 2008 anammox xing et al 2016 wang et al 2018b and activated sludge systems yilmaz et al 2007 under starvation conditions the sludge decomposition can cause the deterioration of the sludge granules lopez et al 2006 van loosdrecht and henze 1999 resulting in the reduction of active biomass and variation in sludge characteristics details discussed below in rss under sulfate starvation conditions decreased influent sulfate from 166 to 50 mg s l the sulfate starvation condition caused a shock impact on the biological conversion fig 1b i e the cod removal efficiency decreased sharply from 92 to 27 in the first 5 days of phase ii i e day 31 to day 35 then increased slightly to 44 in the following 25 days f fcritical table s2 correspondingly the δcod δs ratio sharply decreased from 2 13 to 1 47 g δcod g s in the first 5 days then gradually increased to 4 86 g δcod g s in the following 25 days f fcritical table s2 the increased δcod δso4 s ratio suggests that the percentage of cod removed by sulfate reduction was decreased and some other anaerobic organics removal reactions e g methanogenesis occurred the shift of biopathway from sulfidogensis to methanogensis were not examined but is worthy of further investigation in rss the mlss and mlvss of sludge and the soluble tn concentration in the bulk liquid remained stable at 8 0 0 1 8 3 0 2 g mlss l 4 9 0 2 5 3 0 2 g mlvss l and 21 0 3 27 0 2 mg n l respectively fig 1d this indicates there was no apparent biomass reduction during the sulfate starvation period but the sulfidogensis activity and the physico chemical and stuctures of granular sludge were obviously affected by the sulfate starvation details discussed below in phase iii when the influent flow and wastewater compositions to both rcs and rss were restored to the normal phase i operating conditions the reactivation of the biological conversion was achieved in a short period of 10 15 days for example in rcs full recovery was achieved within 10 days i e the cod removal efficiency increased from 20 at day 60 under complete food starvation to around 90 at day 70 sulfide concentration in the effluent increased to over 100 mg s l and the δcod δ s ratio returned back to its theoretical stoichiometric value of 2 similarly the full recovery time of rss was approximately 15 days which is slightly longer than that of rcs nevertheless the overall the 10 15 days reactivation for sulfidogenic systems are clearly faster than that of methanogenic systems which need at least 28 days as reported in jáuregui jáuregui et al 2014 bae et al 1995 and manariotis and grigoropoulos 2008 but much slower than that of aerobic activated sludge system 5 days torà et al 2011 yilmaz et al 2007 these results on sulfidogenic system recovery are useful for scale up application 3 1 2 effect on sulfidogenic activity and srb populations specific biomass activites two parameters are generally used to evaluate the sulfidogenic biomass activities i e the specific removal rate of cod srrcod and specific sulfidogenic activity ssa omil et al 1997 greben et al 2000 hao et al 2016 these parameters were measured by conducting batch tests every 5 7 days with the biomass harvested from rcs and rss the obtained experimental data is plotted in the supplementary fig 1 fig s1 and the calculated specific rates are summarized in table 2 in the normal phase i the srrcod and ssa of rcs and rss were maintained at relatively high levels of 35 38 mg cod g vss h and 13 16 mg s reduced g vss h these values serve as the control baseline for comparison during the starvation phase ii both the complete food starvation and sulfate starvation had strong negative effects on the sulfidogenic biomass activities under complete food starvation the srrcod and ssa of the biomass in rcs gradually decreased from 34 6 to 13 4 mg cod g vss h and from 12 5 to 6 9 mg s reduced g vss h respectively over 25 days f fcritical table s2 comparatively the srrcod and ssa of the rss biomass decreased from 34 4 to 12 1 cod g vss h and from 12 5 to 4 9 mg s reduced g vss h respectively from day 31 to day 45 and then these low biomass activities remained unchanged until day 60 f fcritical table s2 thus the sulfate starvation condition caused a faster and larger reduction in the biomass sulfidogenic activity than the complete food starvation the srrcod and ssa of rcs recovered to normal levels within 10 days before day 70 while for rss it took 15 days to recover hence the time needed for the full recovery of the specific sulfidogenic activites under the two conditions coincided with reactor performance restoration this reactivation is in agreement with the observations of hao et al 2016 and lens and kuenen 2001 suggesting that sulfate reducing bacteria have strong resilience to unfavorable conditions srb population fish based microbiological analytical techniques were applied to visualize the effect of starvation on the abundance and distribution of srb in the sludge granules fig 2 the granules of rcs and rss at day 30 60 and 75 representing normal starvation and reactivation phases were examined for the granules taken from the rcs fig 2a and rss fig 2b at day 30 the total bacteria blue and srb green are evenly distributed and highly overlapping which indicates as expected that srb are prevalent in the granular sludge under normal conditions high srb to total bacteria ratios of 52 7 in rcs granules and 56 6 in rss granules were obtained by analyzing the fluorescing intensities of srb and total bacteria in fig 2a and b respectively with imagej after 30 days of starvation at day 60 the srb to total bacteria ratio of the rcs granules decreased to 46 2 fig 2c and of the rss granules to 40 3 fig 2d under complete food starvation and sulfate starvation respectively this indicates that both the two starvation conditions were the cause of the decrease of srb abundance in the granules and consequently reduced their sulfidogenic biomass activity and that sulfate starvation caused a larger impact this is consisten with the larger deterioration of sulfidogenic biomass activity in the sulfate starved rss as mentioned above from day 75 15 days into the reactivation phase iii intense and homogeneously distributed fluorescence signals of both total bacteria and srb are again observed in the granules fig 2e and f the restoration of the srb population is coincident with the full recovery of sulfidogenic activity and was confirmed in the batch tests mentioned above si 3 3 1 3 effect on sludge separation capacity sludge solid liquid separation measured in terms svi5 and svi30 and sludge flotation potential sfp is important for bioreactor stable operation henze et al 2008 jenkins et al 2003 the changes in svi and sfp in rcs and rss over the three experimental phases are shown in fig 1e and f sludge settling in the normal phase i the svi5 and svi5 svi30 ratio of rcs and rss sludges remained stable in the low range of 34 4 to 41 3 ml g and 1 0 0 06 to 1 2 0 02 respectively the svi5 of the granular sludge was lower than the critical value 40 60 ml g for typical granular sludge henze et al 2008 and the low svi5 svi30 ratio indicated that excellent settleability of the granular sludge was maintained in both reactors schwarzenbeck et al 2005 then in rcs under complete food starvation the svi5 and svi5 svi30 increased sharply over day 40 60 from 30 3 to 92 3 ml g and 1 1 0 09 to 2 5 0 08 respectively indicating the sludge settleability deteriorated markedly f fcritical table s2 this poor sludge settleability resulting from complete food starvation in rcs required approximately 15 days day 61 to day 75 to recover to its normal operation levels in the reactivation phase in contrast sulfate starvation had a low impact on sludge settleability the svi5 of the rss sludge only slightly increased from 36 6 to 45 3 ml g during the whole 30 day sulfate starvation phase and then recovered to the pre starvation level around 35 ml g within 5 days of reactivation similarly the svi5 svi30 ratio in rss was not significantly influenced by the sulfate starvation and remained stable in a range of 1 1 0 02 to 1 3 0 13 throughout the sulfate starvation and following reactivation phases sludge flotation sfp is another important parameter for assessing the solid liquid separation capacity of sludge de beer et al 1996 wang et al 2017 the sfp of both rcs and rss was maintained below the critical safe value of 20 halalsheh et al 2005 in the normal phase fig 1f at the end of the starvation phase ii on day 60 the sfp of rcs had increased to a high level of 58 1 while the sfp of rss increased less to only 35 1 the sfp of rcs is approximately 1 7 times of the sfp of rss at the end of the starvation phase f fcritical table s2 these results suggest that i both complete and sulfate starvation conditions could trigger sludge flotation problems in sulfidogenic sludge systems and ii comparatively sulfidogenic sludges suffering from complete food starvation was more likely to float than sludge suffering from the sulfate starvation over the same time period this observations in rcs and rss are in agreement with the findings in starvation studies on methanogenic and anammox reactors in which the granular sludges tend to float after a prolonged period of starvation or storage kosaric et al 1990 bae et al 1995 xing et al 2016 nevertheless the critical value of sfp 20 could be regained within 15 and 10 days in the rcs and rss respectively fig 1f 3 2 granular sludge transformation 3 2 1 effect on physical structure aspects of the physical structure of sludge granules such as morphology permeability and porosity are believed to be closely related to the mass transfer of the granules lemaire et al 2008 di iaconi et al 2006 and sludge liquid separation capacity xing et al 2016 hence the morphology fractal dimension bet surface area total pore volume and average pore size of the sludge granules were measured to investigate the effects of the starvation conditions on the sludge s physical structure as well as attempting to further explain their relationship with reactor performance morphology during the normal phase i sludge granules with clear boundaries semi spherical shape and compact inner structure were observed in rcs fig 2a and rss fig 2b afterward during the complete food starved phase ii the rcs granules adopted a loose structure with dispersed boundaries fig 2c the structural deterioration might be related to the cell lysis caused by the complete absence of electron donor cod and electron acceptor so4 2 in contrast the rss granules subjected to sulfate starvation maintained a semi spherical morphology but hollow spaces were formed fig 4d both the loose structure in the rcs granules and the hollow spaces in the rss granules are unfavorable factors that tend to decrease the sludge density and increase the potential of gas entrapment campos et al 2017 bae et al 1995 and hence increases the potential of sludge flotation permeability the fractal dimension of granular sludge is widely used to evaluate the permeability of sludge granules a high fractal dimension suggests a high permeability bellouti et al 1997 mu et al 2006 fig 3 a shows that the fractal dimension of rcs granules clearly decreased from 3 35 0 28 at day 29 to 2 13 0 15 at day 60 after 30 days of complete food starvation in contrast the sulfate starvation had no significant effect on the fractal dimension of the rss granules which remained stable at around 3 3 f fcritical table s2 as the fractal dimension is positively correlated with the efficiency of mass transfer between the bulk liquid and granules bellouti et al 1997 qian et al 2017 the decrease of the fractal dimension in this study suggested that the permeability i e mass transfer efficiency of the sulfidogenic granules in rcs was significantly reduced by the complete food starvation porosity the porosity of the sludge granules was evaluated by bet surface area total pore volume and average pore size for rcs sludge during the complete food starvation the bet surface area decreased from 4 76 0 05 to 3 91 0 07 m2 g fig 3b the total pore volume clearly decreased from 0 021 0 01 to 0 013 0 03 ml g fig 3c and the average pore size also clearly decreased from 54 4 6 0 to 32 6 1 4 nm fig 3d f fcritical table s2 for rss sludge during the sulfate starvation phase the bet surface area only slightly decreased from 4 61 0 03 to 4 01 0 08 m2 g fig 3b but the total pore volume and average pore size clearly increased from 0 018 0 03 to 0 028 0 03 ml g fig 3c and 46 3 1 4 to 55 9 5 4 nm fig 3d respectively f fcritical table s2 the porosity results measured in this study were close to the values reported by hao et al 2015 who measured the bet surface area and total pore volume in their sulfidogenic granular sludge to be 3 3 4 1 m2 g and 0 019 0 025 ml g respectively the increasing trend of the total pore volume and average pore size during the sulfate starvation in rss which is the opposite of the decreasing trend in complete food starvation in rcs is consistent with the formation of hollow spaces in the rss granules as observed in fig 2d 3 2 2 effect on chemical properties the chemical properties of granular sludge such as lb tb eps mg toc g vss and the chemical composition of eps proteins humic acid and polysaccharides as well as the sludge surface properties hydrophobicity and viscocity were measured to investigate the transformation of sulfidogenic granular sludge under starvation conditions lb tb eps the eps composition in terms of lb eps and tb eps in the sludge of rcs and rss remained stable in a narrow range during the normal phase i day 1 30 between 3 0 1 5 to 4 9 0 6 mg toc g vss and 24 2 to 30 3 mg toc g vss respectively and the ratio of lb eps to tb eps was constant at a relatively low level between 0 11 0 02 to 0 17 0 03 g lb eps g tb eps during complete food starvation from day 31 to day 60 large transitions took place in the characteristics of the sludge eps in rcs gradually the lb eps increased to 11 1 mg toc g vss the tb eps decreased to 17 2 mg toc g vss and the lb eps tb eps ratio increased to a high level of 0 63 0 1 which was approximately 6 times the lb eps tb eps ratio during the normal phase fig 4a f fcritical table s2 in contrast the impact of the sulfate starvation on the sludge eps of rss was not as large as that caused in rcs as shown in fig 4b the lb eps and tb eps showed little change also the trends of eps changes observed in the rcs and rss sludges were different probably due to the availability of organic cod to rss the srb under complete food starvation in rcs had no external carbon energy source and the eps was quickly consumed sheng et al 2010 in contrast the eps was consumed more slowly in rss under the sulfate starvation condition because the influent with cod and other nutrients n p k was continuously provided during the sulfate starvation phase although the total eps decreased in both rss and in rcs the lb eps increased in both perhaps because the microbes in harsh environments increased their production of lb eps to protect themselves from impairment franco et al 2006 xing et al 2015 the increase in lb eps and decrease in tb eps as caused by the starvation conditions in this study might lead the sludge granules to be less compact and more adhesive to nearby biogas bubbles resulting in poor settleability and high potential for sludge flotation sheng et al 2010 wang et al 2018a chemical properties three major categories of eps chemical components including the protein like tyrosine amino acid substances the soluble microbial by products like substances a mixture of protein like and humic like substances and the humic like substances were detected from the extracted eps samples from both rcs and rss via eem fluorescence analysis fig 5 chen et al 2003 more detailed information was provided in si 4 from comparison of the fluorescence intensities complete food starvation changed the eps chemical characteristics more significantly than the sulfate starvation by reducing the concentrations of the protein like components in the eps and altering their ratio table s1 furthermore the proteins pn humic acid hs and polysaccharides ps were measured in the eps extracts the results show that in the normal phase pn ps and the pn ps ratio remained stable in rcs and rss between 72 and 102 mg g vss 26 41 mg g vss and 2 3 to 3 8 respectively fig 4c and d under complete food starvation of rcs the pn decreased slightly to 54 4 mg g vss and the ps decreased substantially to 11 1 mg g vss these changes led to the pn ps ratio increasing to a high value of 4 8 0 4 fig 4c f fcritical table s2 comparatively the eps composition in rss fig 4d did not change as much as the eps in rcs as shown in fig 4d in the literature the pn ps ratio of eps is documented as a good indicator of the granule settleability su and yu 2005 franco et al 2006 and possibly also of sludge flotation cuervo lópez et al 1999 li et al 2014 the typical pn ps ratio of normal sulfidogenic granules ranges from 1 0 to 4 0 hao et al 2016 tsui et al 2016 wang et al 2018a in the present study the maximum pn ps ratios of the rcs and rss during their starvation phases were 6 5 0 2 and 3 9 0 3 respectively complete food starvation resulted in a pn ps ratio over the critical value of 5 and higher than the normal ranges of stable sulfidogenic sludge but sulfate starvation did not additionally as shown in fig s2 increases of hydrophobicity and viscosity and a decrease in negative surface charge of the sludge were caused by the two starvation conditions detail in si 5 these changes point to the sludge granules becoming more adhesive to gas bubbles wang et al 2018a these unfavorable transitions induced by the starvation conditions therefore could stimulate gas bubble entrapment in the sludge granules thereby reducing sludge liquid separation efficiency 4 conclusions the performance of the cgr srusb was tested under two realistic operational malfunctions for 30 days i the complete stoppage of wastewater complete food starvation and ii the decrease of the influent sulfate concentration to a very low level sulfate starvation the following conclusions are drawn the biological conversion capability of the sulfidogenic sludge decreased substantially during the starvation conditions approximately 61 and 65 reductions of the specific removal rate of organic cod and 45 and 61 reductions of the specific sulfidogenic activity of the sulfidogenic granules were observed after 30 days of complete food starvation and sulfate starvation respectively sulfate starvation had a larger impact on biological conversion sludge solid liquid separation efficiency deteriorated significantly during both of the starvation conditions i the svi5 svi30 ratio increased from 1 1 to 2 5 and from 1 1 to 1 3 and ii the sludge flotation potential increased from below 20 critical safe value to 58 and 35 after the 30 days of complete food starvation and sulfate starvation respectively complete food starvation exerted a larger impact on solid liquid separation the starvation conditions especially complete food starvation led to i deterioration of the structural and chemical characteristics of the sludge eps as measured by an increase the lb eps tb eps ratio to 0 63 0 1 and the pn ps ratio to 6 5 0 2 ii unfavorable changes in the sludge surface adhesive properties by increasing hydrophobicity to 55 5 increasing viscosity to 2 8 0 07 mpa s and weakening surface charge to 16 4 mv and iii alteration of the sludge s physical structure by decreasing permeability and porosity promoting the formation of inner hollow spaces these unfavorable changes tend to increase gas sludge entrapment and decrease granule density thereby decreasing solid liquid separation efficiency and increasing sludge flotqtioon potential the overall performance of the two starved cgr srusb reactors was quickly recovered after 10 15 days of reactivation operation this satisfactory reactivation performance reflected the high resilience of the newly designed cgr srusb reactors declarations of interest none acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the

19054,a novel electro assisted membrane bioreactor embr was constructed by integrating conductive carbon nanotubes hollow fiber membranes cnts hfms into an aerobic activated sludge system herein the cnts hfms served as anode and filtration core simultaneously contrasted with the other two mbrs pvdf hfms and cnts hfms without electro assistance the effluent cod and nh4 n were lower than 40 mg l and 3 mg l at 1 0 v even hrt as short as 4 h however they were mostly over 50 mg l cod and 5 mg l nh4 n under the same conditions in the other two mbrs the hydraulic cleaning for electro assisted cnts hfms was carried out only once during 60 day operation and the permeate flux recovered to 100 of the original status while four and five times hydraulic cleaning were executed for other two mbrs pvdf hfms and cnts hfms respectively furthermore merely 50 min continuous electrochemical oxidation was enough to resume flux of the heavily fouled cnts hfms i e flux recovered to 2020 87 l bar m2 h from 394 68 l bar m2 h pure water flux 2200 l bar m2 h simpson and shannon indexes indicated enhanced microbial community stability in embr thus electro assisted cnts hfms endow embr excellent anti fouling ability and good effluent quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords embr carbon nanotubes hollow fiber membranes membrane fouling transmembrane pressure electrochemical effect 1 introduction energy efficient and environmentally friendly wastewater treatment technologies for safe and clean water supply are stimulated by dwindling water resources and harsh environmental regulations oller et al 2011 qu et al 2013 membrane bioreactor mbr is preferred to traditional biological treatment technologies due to less sludge loss and smaller space occupation ho and sung 2010 tazi pain et al 2002 tsai et al 2010 however membrane fouling remains a heavy challenge which is a highly complex process with the interaction of membrane materials and various foulants mainly extracellular polymeric substances eps chang and lee 1998 eps including soluble microbial products smp are macromolecule polymers i e polysaccharides proteins and nucleic acids laspidou and rittmann 2002 sheng et al 2010 hitherto multiple strategies such as employing novel membrane materials with excellent properties like high mechanical strength good water transport and high surface area vatanpour et al 2011 wang et al 2013 improvement of process conditions backwashing frequency and solids retention time optimization of system design such as aeration were dedicated to overcome the membrane fouling and improve effluent quality le clech et al 2006 meng et al 2009 however above strategies mostly focused on reversible membrane fouling and seemed to be ineffective on irreversible membrane fouling moreover when mbr system are under high strength conditions high organic pollutants concentration or short hydraulic retention time hrt le clech et al 2006 meng et al 2009 vatanpour et al 2011 wang et al 2013 above strategies are not satisfied with the demand of controlling membrane fouling and improving effluent quality recently some research has recognized that electrochemical techniques may be another feasible option of effectively mitigating the membrane fouling and improving the effluent quality a akamatsu et al 2010 bani melhem and elektorowicz 2010 liu et al 2013 in the study of chen et al 2007 membrane filtration performance was improved and membrane fouling problem was mitigated by electrochemical repulsion via reducing charged pollutants depositing on the membrane surface however to alleviate the membrane fouling the membrane module was constructed by combining the non conductive membranes with stainless steel which increased the electric energy consumption and reduced the efficiency of utilizing electro repulsion effect more recently membrane surface modified or fabricated by conductive materials have gained a lot of attention chen et al 2007 katuri et al 2014 katuri et al reported that a barrier around the membrane model was formed by directly applying potential on nickel based hollow fiber membranes which could prevent negatively charged pollutants attachment on the membrane surface katuri et al 2014 antifouling abilities of membranes were enhanced by combining electrochemical repulsion thus reducing the frequency of membrane cleaning or displacement however the membrane fouling would also be aggravated when relatively more pollutants passed the membrane pores decreasing hrt or increasing influent pollutants strength le clech et al 2006 meng et al 2009 vatanpour et al 2011 wang et al 2013 therefore such membrane fouling formed under above circumstances was difficult to mitigate only by the electrostatic repulsion carbon nanotubes cnts based membranes with the mesh like and overlap structures present a lot of excellent properties such as good chemical inertness large specific surface area and high mechanical strength hinds et al 2004 sears et al 2010 wei et al 2014 2015 yu et al 2008 importantly cnts are endowed the good characteristic of electrochemical abilities which is beneficial for electron transmitting thus cnts based membranes with much outstanding performance like high porosities 70 and abundant interconnected pores wei et al 2014 2015 sears et al 2010 yi et al 2018 were convenient for water transportation moreover electrochemical oxidation would be more efficient for improving effluent quality and controlling membrane fouling contrasted with electrostatic repulsion since it could degrade various pollutants mainly eps on the membrane surface or in deep pores timely and effectively chang and lee 1998 laspidou and rittmann 2002 sheng et al 2010 hence cnts based membranes as the anode will be very promising as electrochemical oxidation against membrane fouling will endow mbr system excellent anti fouling property and filtration performance however research is very scarce about the antifouling properties and control mechanisms of cnts based membrane with electrochemical oxidation in mbrs also the effect of the electro assisted cnts as anode materials on sludge properties such as microbial community and their diversity need be further evaluated fan et al 2015 iversen et al 2009 thrash and coates 2008 herein a novel electro assisted membrane bioreactor embr process was built up based on cnts hollow fiber membranes cnts hfms as the basic separation unit and anode the electrochemical oxidation coupled with membrane filtration to mitigate membrane fouling and improve effluent quality was presented in embr system to verify the feasibility of this embr system transmembrane pressure tmp removal performance of chemical oxygen demand cod and nh4 n variation of eps composition and content were investigated in this work in order to further verify the effect of electrochemical oxidation on mitigating fouling the permeate flux recovery of heavily fouled cnts hfms was evaluated by electrochemical oxidation through applying positive voltage on the membranes meanwhile the impact on the microbial community and diversity under applied voltage were also discussed in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of membranes the fabricated procedures of cnts hfms were presented in supplementary materials the pure water flux of membrane was calculated as follows 1 j v a δ t where j is the permeation flux l m 2 h 1 v is the volume of the permeate l a is the membrane area m2 and δt is the permeate collection interval h other analytical methods were as followings 1 automatic contact angle meter sl200b kono industrial co ltd usa was used to record contact angle θ of membranes 2 membrane pore size was measured using the pore size tester porolux tm 1000 porometer germany 3 porosity p of membranes was determined by gravimetric method for three times which can be calculated by following equation 2 p m 1 m 2 ρ w a l where m1 and m2 were the weight of the wet and dry membrane g respectively ρw was the water density 1 g cm3 a was the effective area of the membrane cm2 and l was the membrane thickness cm 4 dissolved oxygen do was measured by dissolved oxygen meter starter 400d ohaus co ltd chain 2 2 optimum voltage determination hitherto many studies generally recognized that extracellular polymeric substances eps chang and lee 1998 is the main foulants in mbrs which consists of proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids lipids humic acids etc and locates at the cell surface meanwhile previous studies also presented that the proteins showed stronger relationship with membrane fouling than other main component of eps chang and lee 1998 laspidou and rittmann 2002 sheng et al 2010 therefore in order to verify the feasibility that the membrane fouling would be alleviated by electrochemical oxidation based on cnts hfms 100 mg l protein bsa sigma aldrich chemical company usa as the main membrane foultant has been chosen in preliminary experiment meanwhile fig s1 showed that an oxidation peak 0 9 v was observed for the solution with 100 mg l bsa this result indicated that bsa could be electrochemically oxidized on the cnts hfms at voltage over 0 9 v in order to clear the relatively optimum voltage in a real filtration process which could avoid the deteriorating of membranes and saving electric energy a wide range voltage around 0 9 v 0 5 v 1 0 v and 1 5 v were directly applied on cnts hfms 8 16 10 5 m2 effective area the experiment was conducted by dead end filtering with 250 ml of working volume and the flow chart of cnts hfms filtration under electrochemical effect was showed in fig s2 titanium mesh 10 cm 13 cm was used as the cathode the protein concentration and variation of membrane flux were measured to confirm the optimum voltage 2 3 embr setup three lab bioreactors with 1 0 l of working volume were built up to investigate the performance of embr system the basic separation unit of mbrs and embr were polyvinylidene fluoride hollow fiber membranes pvdf hfms cnts hfms and cnts hfms with electro assistance respectively embr system was presented in fig 1 cnts hfms 5 44 10 4 m2 of effective area was used as the anode and titanium mesh 10 cm 10 cm was configured as cathode the sludge in reactors came from dalian lingshui wastewater treatment plant compositions of pending synthetic municipal wastewater and other operation conditions were presented in table s1 and table s2 ph was maintained around 7 8 by nahco3 in the influent do was 2 4 mg l 2 4 analytical methods wastewater treatment performance of embr was assessed by cod and nh4 n removal rates antifouling ability of electro assisted cnts hfms was evaluated by sem images fesem hitachi s 8010 and the tmp changes in order to deeply reveal the antifouling mechanisms of cnts hfms with electro assistance in embr the concentration and composition variations of protein epsp and polysaccharide epsc in supernatant around the membranes module and in biomass were measured among them the composition of eps was demonstrated by three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy fl4500 hitachi japan moreover high throughput sequencing technologies were used to deeply analyze the influence on microbial communities under electrochemical environment other analytical methods methods of cleaning and eps measurement were presented in supplementary materials 2 5 energy consumption energy consumption is an inevitable matter in practical applications for electro assisted membrane separation processes electric energy provided to the system by the power source was calculated as the following zhao et al 2016 w1 uit where u v is the voltage applied by power source i is the current a and t h is the time of the operation other energy consumptions mainly included wastewater pumping and air supplying which calculated by the equation w2 pt where p is the power of pumps kw and t h is the time of the operation 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of membranes hydrophilic functional groups e g cooh has been modified on the cnts after acidification which endowed cnts hfms a good hydrophilicity average contact angles was 72 51 as showed in table s3 moreover as constructed cnt membranes with mesh like structures usually present plentiful interconnected pores fig s3 and relatively high porosities 80 above promising properties endowed cnts hmfs a relatively high pure water flux 2200 l bar m2 h however the pure water permeate flux of pvdf hfms was around 1100 l bar m2 h due to the hydrophilicity average contact angles was 108 8 and relatively low porosities around 66 above excellent properties of cnts hfms is beneficial for the long term operation and stability of mbrs 3 2 optimum voltage the overhigh operating voltage is adverse to the membrane material s stability microbial activity and energy saving hence a suitable operating voltage is essential in the process of removing pollutants by electrochemical oxidation wang et al 1999 therefore 100 mg l bsa was selected as filtration targets with different positive voltages applied on cnts hfms in batch experiments the optimum operating voltage of embr was determined according to bsa removal and membrane flux changes during the operation as shown in fig 2 a when the applied voltages on cnts hfms were 1 0 v and 1 5 v the effluent bsa concentrations after 120 min filtration were 51 37 mg l and 52 37 mg l respectively these values were lower than that of cnts hfms without applied voltage 65 15 mg l mainly due to combining electrochemical oxidation with membrane filtration shumyantseva et al 2018 wang et al 2018 and the applied voltage of 1 5 v resulted in the water decomposition thus a portion of energy was consumed to water electrolysis katuri et al 2014 as shown in fig s1 an oxidation peak 0 9 v was observed for the solution with 100 mg l bsa this result indicated that bsa could be electrochemically oxidized on the cnts hfms at voltage over 0 9 v at 0 5 v the voltage was not enough to electrochemically oxidize bsa meanwhile the phenomenon of concentration polarization on membrane surface was aggravated when the 0 5 v of applied voltage was applied on the membrane since the positively charged membrane can attract the negatively charged bsa this even led to a higher effluent bsa concentrations 69 78 mg l after 120 min filtration than that at 0 v thus 1 0 v seemed to be the optimum for bsa removal performances membrane flux variation was also another obvious evidence to assess whether membrane fouling was alleviated by reducing foulants on the membrane surface with electrochemical oxidation yang et al 2018a wang et al 2018 the flux changes with different applied voltage are presented in fig 2b when 1 0 v of applied voltage was used on cnts hfms the bsa around the membrane surface was oxidized rapidly shumyantseva et al 2018 wang et al 2018 thus a relatively higher membrane flux was obtained at 1 0 v 412 2 l bar m2 h compared to the cnts hfms without applied voltage 200 66 l bar m2 h after 120 min filtration meanwhile the membrane flux at 1 5 v 303 11 l bar m2 h was lower than that with 1 0 v because water electrolysis consumed a portion of energy katuri et al 2014 the electric energy used for oxidizing pollutants was actually less than the energy provided by 1 5 v moreover the bubbles formed on the membranes surface would hinder the water transmission which further reduced the membrane flux at 0 5 v bsa can not be degraded sufficiently adversely this voltage value accelerated the adhesion of bsa on the membrane surface shumyantseva et al 2018 wang et al 2018 which resulted in the decrease of membrane flux from 200 66 l bar m2 h 0 v to 127 31 l bar m2 h 0 5 v after 120 min filtration therefore 1 0 v was chosen as the optimum voltage applying on the embr system 3 3 wastewater treatment ability fig 3 a illustrates the cod removal of mbrs and embr at different hrts during the 61 day operation the hrts of all systems were 16 h the 1st 10th day 8 h the 11th 20th day and 4 h the 21st 61st day respectively and influent cod was set around 500 mg l in all bioreactors most of cod were mainly removed by microorganisms therefore a good effluent quality cod 50 mg l was obtained in all bioreactors during the 5th day to the 20th day first 5 days initial period of activated sludge domestication due to enough microbial concentration vss 3000 mg l and relatively long hrts 8 h however from the 21st day to the 37th day stage iii and iv the effluent cod of mbrs increased to about 78 mg l because hrt was decreased from 8 h to 4 h nevertheless in embr the effluent cod was still maintained at a relatively low level 61 mg l combined with the lower cod values in supernatant of embr around 50 mg l at hrt of 4 h than those in other two mbrs around 60 mg l at hrt of 4 h the good wastewater treatment in embr could be attributed to the enhanced aerobic microorganisms activity at 1 0 v fig s4a ding et al 2018a qian et al 2017 moreover a portion of cod could be further removed by electrochemical oxidation in embr ding et al 2018a 2018b when carbonaceous contaminants passed through the anode films electro assisted cnts hfms therefore even though at a shorter hrt of 4 h the 21st 61st day the effluent cod of embr at voltage of 1 0 v was mostly lower than 40 mg l however they were higher than 50 mg l in other two mbrs thus electrochemical effect endowed embr a better cod removal efficiency higher than 95 at hrt of 4 h and an enhanced microbial activity than those of mbrs the nh4 n concentration variations in effluent and in supernatant with the operation time in mbrs and embr were presented in fig 3b and fig s4b influent nh4 n concentration 25 mg l the effluent nh4 n in embr was always lower than those of other two mbrs during the 1st day to the 20th day a good effluent quality with nh4 n less than 2 mg l in both embr and mbrs was obtained due to relatively high vss 3000 mg l and long hrt 8 h which indicated a sufficiently utilization of nh4 n by microorganisms nevertheless the effluent nh4 n concentration of embr was also average lower about 0 5 mg l than those of mbrs combined the always relatively lower nh4 n concentration in embr than those in mbrs 2 63 mg l an enhanced microbial activity was obtained under electrochemical effect which promoted the nh4 n removal moreover a portion of nh4 n also could be further removed by electrochemical oxidation in embr ding et al 2018a 2018b when contaminants nh4 n passed through the electro assisted cnts hfms ding et al 2018a 2018b and this phenomenon was especially obvious at relatively short hrt and low vss stage iii to stage vii during the 20th day to the 40th day the nh4 n removal efficiency decreased in all bioreactors because nh4 n was insufficiently utilized by microorganisms at hrt of 4 h however in embr system the average effluent nh4 n concentration and nh4 n removal efficiency were still lower than 5 mg l and more than 80 respectively this performance was better than those results in other two mbrs with pvdf hfms and cnts hfms without electro assistance higher than 7 mg l 3 4 mitigation of membrane fouling in the embr 3 4 1 evolution of tmp fig 4 shows the tmp variations in embr and mbrs in two month operation the transmembrane pressure gradually increased over operation then dropped immediately after hydraulic cleaning at each cleaning cycle although similar tmp variation trends were observed at different experimental operating stages the time span of mbrs and embr depending on electrochemical effect and membrane properties need be considered in other words the membrane fouling trends were approximately reflected by the frequency of membrane hydraulic cleaning and according our previous studies yang et al 2018a 2018b a moderate tmp value 0 6 bar was set as the threshold tmp value to perform membrane cleaning the cnts hfms used in this study had a good hydrophilicity the average contact angle was 72 51 and interwoven network structure fig s3 good hydrophilicity was beneficial for the water film forming on the hydrophilic membrane surface which can prevent the insoluble contaminants attaching on the surface of cnts hfms and interwoven network structure further inhibited contaminants from blocking the pore channels seriously wang et al 2007 thus the pvdf hfms and cnts hfms without applied voltage were cleaned five and four times respectively however only one maintenance was conducted in embr at 1 0 v the mesh like structure fig s3 with electrochemical oxidation distributed cnts hfms in embr an excellent antifouling ability which effectively hindered pollutants from deeply blocking the membrane pores or removed them immediately ding et al 2018a qian et al 2017 yang et al 2018a 2018b and high membrane surface porosity of cnts hfms 81 table s3 endowed embr a high membrane permeate flux even at a low operation pressure the easily removable fouling was caused by loosely attached pollutants whereas irreversible membrane fouling was caused by deeply pores blocking or stronger attachment of pollutants on membrane surface fu et al 2012 meng et al 2009 after the final cleaning the tmps of pvdf hfms and cnts hfms without electro assistance were recovered to 0 15 bar and 0 09 bar respectively which were much higher than the initial levels 0 01 bar in embr the recovered tmp value was in agreement with the initial situation 0 01 bar after the same hydraulic cleaning it can be recognized that the electrochemical oxidation can remove foulants on the membrane surface or even deeply inside the membrane pores which demonstrated a positive influence on controlling irreversible membrane fouling 3 4 2 microscopic observation on the fouled membrane the fouled membranes were taken out from all mbrs at the end of the operation to visually evaluate the membrane fouling by sem images fig s5 indicates the most representative extent of membrane fouling at magnifications of 300 μm and 5 μm the surface of pvdf figs s5a and b and cnts membrane modules figs s5c and d without electro assistance were still covered by a dense cake layer even after hydraulic cleaning according to the results of tmp variation and sem images the layer covered on the pvdf hfm and cnts hfm surface without electro assistance were most likely associated with irreversible membrane fouling which heavily blocked the membrane pore sizes yang et al 2018a 2018b in contrast for the cnts hfms taken from embr the fouling was greatly mitigated in fig s5f the part of the visible mesh like structure of cnts hfms was similar as the initial state fig s3 electro assistance was the only different operational condition between mbr cnts hfms and embr cnts hfms with 1 0 v thus it can be concluded that the membrane fouling was alleviated due to direct and timely removal of contaminants mainly polysaccharides and proteins by electrochemical oxidation 3 4 3 eps contents fig s6 and fig s7 present the epsp and epsc composition and concentration of bound eps extracted from the mixed activated sludge the results indicated that eps in embr had a great difference on content rather than composition compared with those in other two mbrs the peak height value attained to the top at 1800 in embr fig s6c which was 300 higher than those in other two mbrs figs s6a and b it implied that much more bound eps in embr than in mbrs probably due to electrochemical environment chung et al 2016 li et al 2015 tian et al 2017 a consistent result was showed in fig s7 the epsp concentration was 64 86 mg l and the epsc concentration reached to 121 97 mg l at 1 0 v while the epsp and epsc concentration in mbr with pvdf hfms and mbr with cnts hfms were 51 34 mg l 107 mg l and 55 14 mg l 97 72 mg l respectively although eps are considered as the major cause of membrane fouling in mbrs they have important physiological functions in nutrient metabolism chang and lee 1998 laspidou and rittmann 2002 sheng et al 2010 in our study membrane fouling was not aggravated by more bound eps content due to electrochemical oxidation which promoted contaminant degradation instead meanwhile with respect to the eps as the main contaminant forming membrane fouling in mbrs chung et al 2016 the low eps smp concentration around the membranes made a great contribution to mitigating membrane fouling as shown in fig 5 the concentration of epsp and epsc in supernatant smp around membranes were less in embr than those in other two mbrs as amino groups in protein with positive charges can be rejected by positively charged cnts hfms in embr yang et al 2018a and the carboxylic groups and phosphoric acid groups in polysaccharide usually have negative charges which can be attracted on the membrane surface and directly oxidized the peptide bonds of protein are generally considered to be more hydrophobic than carbohydrates and the epsp would easily be adsorbed in the hydrophobic surface or pores in pvdf hfms chung et al 2016 drews et al 2007 however acidification endowed cnts hfms a better hydrophilicity average contact angle 72 51 therefore sludge flocs have a strong tendency to accumulate on pvdf hfms surface which increased the filtration resistance liu et al 2011 tian et al 2011 other studies had shown that protein could chelate with positive metal ions in the water and link into gelatinous mass which could form gel layer irreversible fouling sheng et al 2010 zhang et al 2007 and the total positive metal ions concentration of the influent was around 13 44 mg l in our study table s1 therefore another reason of electrochemical effect on alleviating membrane fouling could be attributed to repulsing positively charged metal ions thus reducing gelatinous mass attaching on membrane surface 3 4 4 flux recovery of fouled membrane by electrochemical effect in order to verify the electrochemical effect on alleviating membrane fouling 1 0 v voltage was applied on the completely fouled cnts hfms taken from mbr at the end of operation pure water flux was measured per 10 min to determine the recovery states fig 6 indicates that the fouling was mitigated gradually at the 50th min the pure water flux was recovered to 2020 87 l bar m2 h which was almost the same as that of pristine cnts hfms 2200 l bar m2 h this can be explained by the electrochemical effect which can directly oxidize pollutants on the membrane surface or in pores ding et al 2018a 2018b combined the intuitional evidence of surface morphologies when the recovery time was less than 50 min obvious pollutants layer was observed in fig 7 a e however at the 50th and the 60th min mesh like structures of cnts hfms were gradually appeared similar to the pristine state of cnts hfms which indicated a relieved membrane fouling 3 5 microbial community in the embr with the aim to assess the influence of electrochemical effect on microbial community structure and diversity of embr system activated sludge from embr was analyzed by high throughput 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing the microbial community structure of the activated sludge at initial stage and after 61 day operation were shown in fig s8 and fig s9 respectively distribution heatmap of genus level microbial communities and species diversity were presented in fig 8 as shown in fig 8a the microbial community structure at genus level in mbr pvdf hfms and mbr cnts hfms had similarity which were much different with those in embr combined with the results presented in fig s9b the content of gemmatimonas 9 09 cloacibacterium 2 99 and delftia 1 79 at genus level in embr were obvious higher than those in other two mbrs they were 6 11 4 79 0 03 0 02 and 0 01 0 002 in mbr pvdf hfms and mbr cnts hfms respectively the difference between r2 cnts hfms and r3 cnts hfms with 1 0 v was only without and with the applying voltage meanwhile the ph was maintained by nahco3 in influent therefore it could be concluded that the application of a voltage could promote microbial growth which enhance organic matter degradation by microorganisms and the electrochemical environment was much more supporting the growth of these three types microorganisms the simpson indexes of mbr pvdf hfms mbr cnts hfms and embr cnts hfms were 0 018 0 018 and 0 019 respectively shannon indexes were 5 657 5 655 and 5 839 respectively for the microbial community in embr it demonstrated that more species appeared in embr when electrochemical effect was applied on the system the more species can enhance the stability of microbial community which was beneficial for microorganism to resist harmful variation from the external environment 3 6 energy consumption energy consumption is one of the major concerns for consideration embr in a practical application for mbrs energy consumption during the operation mainly includes wastewater pumping and air supplying in our study the total energy consumption of embr was estimated to be 2 1 kwh per unit m3 of permeate according to the calculation detailed quantification procedures of pump power consumption were presented in table s4 among them 1 25 kwh per unit m3 was used for air supplying and 0 8 kwh per unit m3 was used for wastewater pumping only 0 05 kwh per unit m3 was used for electrochemical reactions previous studies indicated that the total energy consumption of mbr processes to treat domestic sewage was known to be 2 2 4 kwh per unit m3 zhang et al 2003a b and can reach up to 6 kwh per unit m3 depending on operational conditions and influent quality tsai et al 2010 our total energy consumption of embr is close to the least value of previous reports for a long term operation the removal of contaminant by electrochemical oxidation might be more effective than electrostatic repulsion with the comparable electricity energy consumption k akamatsu et al 2010 meanwhile the electrochemical oxidation could be more economical and feasible to deal with other kinds of wastewater which is not easily be utilized by microorganisms essadki et al 2008 for the case of alleviating membrane fouling with electro assistance the cnts hfms was cleaned only once during the whole operation while five and four times were needed for pvdf hfms and cnts hfms without electro assistance respectively this indicated that permeate flux loss of the cnts hfms at 1 0 v was decreased relative to that without electro assistance moreover the 0 05 kwh per unit m3 additional electrical energy consumption only accounted for 2 38 of the total energy consumption the decreases of membrane flux loss and operational costs under the electro assistance resulted in the energy savings envisaging prospect and superiority of this novel process 4 conclusions a novel aerobic treatment system was built up by combining the electrochemical oxidation with membrane filtration using the cnts hfms for wastewater treatment the electro enhanced cnts hfms presented a good antifouling and separation performance for the removal of cod and nh4 n at hrt of 4 h removal rates higher than 92 and 88 respectively moreover the membrane fouling was greatly alleviated by electrochemical oxidation via removing foulants on the membrane surface or even deeply inside the membrane pores in embr the species diversity was more complex compared with those in other two mbrs which enhanced the stability of microbial community therefore this work indicated that cnts hfms with the electrochemical oxidation applied to the mbr system were a promising method to enhance wastewater treatment performance and alleviate membrane fouling author

19054,a novel electro assisted membrane bioreactor embr was constructed by integrating conductive carbon nanotubes hollow fiber membranes cnts hfms into an aerobic activated sludge system herein the cnts hfms served as anode and filtration core simultaneously contrasted with the other two mbrs pvdf hfms and cnts hfms without electro assistance the effluent cod and nh4 n were lower than 40 mg l and 3 mg l at 1 0 v even hrt as short as 4 h however they were mostly over 50 mg l cod and 5 mg l nh4 n under the same conditions in the other two mbrs the hydraulic cleaning for electro assisted cnts hfms was carried out only once during 60 day operation and the permeate flux recovered to 100 of the original status while four and five times hydraulic cleaning were executed for other two mbrs pvdf hfms and cnts hfms respectively furthermore merely 50 min continuous electrochemical oxidation was enough to resume flux of the heavily fouled cnts hfms i e flux recovered to 2020 87 l bar m2 h from 394 68 l bar m2 h pure water flux 2200 l bar m2 h simpson and shannon indexes indicated enhanced microbial community stability in embr thus electro assisted cnts hfms endow embr excellent anti fouling ability and good effluent quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords embr carbon nanotubes hollow fiber membranes membrane fouling transmembrane pressure electrochemical effect 1 introduction energy efficient and environmentally friendly wastewater treatment technologies for safe and clean water supply are stimulated by dwindling water resources and harsh environmental regulations oller et al 2011 qu et al 2013 membrane bioreactor mbr is preferred to traditional biological treatment technologies due to less sludge loss and smaller space occupation ho and sung 2010 tazi pain et al 2002 tsai et al 2010 however membrane fouling remains a heavy challenge which is a highly complex process with the interaction of membrane materials and various foulants mainly extracellular polymeric substances eps chang and lee 1998 eps including soluble microbial products smp are macromolecule polymers i e polysaccharides proteins and nucleic acids laspidou and rittmann 2002 sheng et al 2010 hitherto multiple strategies such as employing novel membrane materials with excellent properties like high mechanical strength good water transport and high surface area vatanpour et al 2011 wang et al 2013 improvement of process conditions backwashing frequency and solids retention time optimization of system design such as aeration were dedicated to overcome the membrane fouling and improve effluent quality le clech et al 2006 meng et al 2009 however above strategies mostly focused on reversible membrane fouling and seemed to be ineffective on irreversible membrane fouling moreover when mbr system are under high strength conditions high organic pollutants concentration or short hydraulic retention time hrt le clech et al 2006 meng et al 2009 vatanpour et al 2011 wang et al 2013 above strategies are not satisfied with the demand of controlling membrane fouling and improving effluent quality recently some research has recognized that electrochemical techniques may be another feasible option of effectively mitigating the membrane fouling and improving the effluent quality a akamatsu et al 2010 bani melhem and elektorowicz 2010 liu et al 2013 in the study of chen et al 2007 membrane filtration performance was improved and membrane fouling problem was mitigated by electrochemical repulsion via reducing charged pollutants depositing on the membrane surface however to alleviate the membrane fouling the membrane module was constructed by combining the non conductive membranes with stainless steel which increased the electric energy consumption and reduced the efficiency of utilizing electro repulsion effect more recently membrane surface modified or fabricated by conductive materials have gained a lot of attention chen et al 2007 katuri et al 2014 katuri et al reported that a barrier around the membrane model was formed by directly applying potential on nickel based hollow fiber membranes which could prevent negatively charged pollutants attachment on the membrane surface katuri et al 2014 antifouling abilities of membranes were enhanced by combining electrochemical repulsion thus reducing the frequency of membrane cleaning or displacement however the membrane fouling would also be aggravated when relatively more pollutants passed the membrane pores decreasing hrt or increasing influent pollutants strength le clech et al 2006 meng et al 2009 vatanpour et al 2011 wang et al 2013 therefore such membrane fouling formed under above circumstances was difficult to mitigate only by the electrostatic repulsion carbon nanotubes cnts based membranes with the mesh like and overlap structures present a lot of excellent properties such as good chemical inertness large specific surface area and high mechanical strength hinds et al 2004 sears et al 2010 wei et al 2014 2015 yu et al 2008 importantly cnts are endowed the good characteristic of electrochemical abilities which is beneficial for electron transmitting thus cnts based membranes with much outstanding performance like high porosities 70 and abundant interconnected pores wei et al 2014 2015 sears et al 2010 yi et al 2018 were convenient for water transportation moreover electrochemical oxidation would be more efficient for improving effluent quality and controlling membrane fouling contrasted with electrostatic repulsion since it could degrade various pollutants mainly eps on the membrane surface or in deep pores timely and effectively chang and lee 1998 laspidou and rittmann 2002 sheng et al 2010 hence cnts based membranes as the anode will be very promising as electrochemical oxidation against membrane fouling will endow mbr system excellent anti fouling property and filtration performance however research is very scarce about the antifouling properties and control mechanisms of cnts based membrane with electrochemical oxidation in mbrs also the effect of the electro assisted cnts as anode materials on sludge properties such as microbial community and their diversity need be further evaluated fan et al 2015 iversen et al 2009 thrash and coates 2008 herein a novel electro assisted membrane bioreactor embr process was built up based on cnts hollow fiber membranes cnts hfms as the basic separation unit and anode the electrochemical oxidation coupled with membrane filtration to mitigate membrane fouling and improve effluent quality was presented in embr system to verify the feasibility of this embr system transmembrane pressure tmp removal performance of chemical oxygen demand cod and nh4 n variation of eps composition and content were investigated in this work in order to further verify the effect of electrochemical oxidation on mitigating fouling the permeate flux recovery of heavily fouled cnts hfms was evaluated by electrochemical oxidation through applying positive voltage on the membranes meanwhile the impact on the microbial community and diversity under applied voltage were also discussed in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of membranes the fabricated procedures of cnts hfms were presented in supplementary materials the pure water flux of membrane was calculated as follows 1 j v a δ t where j is the permeation flux l m 2 h 1 v is the volume of the permeate l a is the membrane area m2 and δt is the permeate collection interval h other analytical methods were as followings 1 automatic contact angle meter sl200b kono industrial co ltd usa was used to record contact angle θ of membranes 2 membrane pore size was measured using the pore size tester porolux tm 1000 porometer germany 3 porosity p of membranes was determined by gravimetric method for three times which can be calculated by following equation 2 p m 1 m 2 ρ w a l where m1 and m2 were the weight of the wet and dry membrane g respectively ρw was the water density 1 g cm3 a was the effective area of the membrane cm2 and l was the membrane thickness cm 4 dissolved oxygen do was measured by dissolved oxygen meter starter 400d ohaus co ltd chain 2 2 optimum voltage determination hitherto many studies generally recognized that extracellular polymeric substances eps chang and lee 1998 is the main foulants in mbrs which consists of proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids lipids humic acids etc and locates at the cell surface meanwhile previous studies also presented that the proteins showed stronger relationship with membrane fouling than other main component of eps chang and lee 1998 laspidou and rittmann 2002 sheng et al 2010 therefore in order to verify the feasibility that the membrane fouling would be alleviated by electrochemical oxidation based on cnts hfms 100 mg l protein bsa sigma aldrich chemical company usa as the main membrane foultant has been chosen in preliminary experiment meanwhile fig s1 showed that an oxidation peak 0 9 v was observed for the solution with 100 mg l bsa this result indicated that bsa could be electrochemically oxidized on the cnts hfms at voltage over 0 9 v in order to clear the relatively optimum voltage in a real filtration process which could avoid the deteriorating of membranes and saving electric energy a wide range voltage around 0 9 v 0 5 v 1 0 v and 1 5 v were directly applied on cnts hfms 8 16 10 5 m2 effective area the experiment was conducted by dead end filtering with 250 ml of working volume and the flow chart of cnts hfms filtration under electrochemical effect was showed in fig s2 titanium mesh 10 cm 13 cm was used as the cathode the protein concentration and variation of membrane flux were measured to confirm the optimum voltage 2 3 embr setup three lab bioreactors with 1 0 l of working volume were built up to investigate the performance of embr system the basic separation unit of mbrs and embr were polyvinylidene fluoride hollow fiber membranes pvdf hfms cnts hfms and cnts hfms with electro assistance respectively embr system was presented in fig 1 cnts hfms 5 44 10 4 m2 of effective area was used as the anode and titanium mesh 10 cm 10 cm was configured as cathode the sludge in reactors came from dalian lingshui wastewater treatment plant compositions of pending synthetic municipal wastewater and other operation conditions were presented in table s1 and table s2 ph was maintained around 7 8 by nahco3 in the influent do was 2 4 mg l 2 4 analytical methods wastewater treatment performance of embr was assessed by cod and nh4 n removal rates antifouling ability of electro assisted cnts hfms was evaluated by sem images fesem hitachi s 8010 and the tmp changes in order to deeply reveal the antifouling mechanisms of cnts hfms with electro assistance in embr the concentration and composition variations of protein epsp and polysaccharide epsc in supernatant around the membranes module and in biomass were measured among them the composition of eps was demonstrated by three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy fl4500 hitachi japan moreover high throughput sequencing technologies were used to deeply analyze the influence on microbial communities under electrochemical environment other analytical methods methods of cleaning and eps measurement were presented in supplementary materials 2 5 energy consumption energy consumption is an inevitable matter in practical applications for electro assisted membrane separation processes electric energy provided to the system by the power source was calculated as the following zhao et al 2016 w1 uit where u v is the voltage applied by power source i is the current a and t h is the time of the operation other energy consumptions mainly included wastewater pumping and air supplying which calculated by the equation w2 pt where p is the power of pumps kw and t h is the time of the operation 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of membranes hydrophilic functional groups e g cooh has been modified on the cnts after acidification which endowed cnts hfms a good hydrophilicity average contact angles was 72 51 as showed in table s3 moreover as constructed cnt membranes with mesh like structures usually present plentiful interconnected pores fig s3 and relatively high porosities 80 above promising properties endowed cnts hmfs a relatively high pure water flux 2200 l bar m2 h however the pure water permeate flux of pvdf hfms was around 1100 l bar m2 h due to the hydrophilicity average contact angles was 108 8 and relatively low porosities around 66 above excellent properties of cnts hfms is beneficial for the long term operation and stability of mbrs 3 2 optimum voltage the overhigh operating voltage is adverse to the membrane material s stability microbial activity and energy saving hence a suitable operating voltage is essential in the process of removing pollutants by electrochemical oxidation wang et al 1999 therefore 100 mg l bsa was selected as filtration targets with different positive voltages applied on cnts hfms in batch experiments the optimum operating voltage of embr was determined according to bsa removal and membrane flux changes during the operation as shown in fig 2 a when the applied voltages on cnts hfms were 1 0 v and 1 5 v the effluent bsa concentrations after 120 min filtration were 51 37 mg l and 52 37 mg l respectively these values were lower than that of cnts hfms without applied voltage 65 15 mg l mainly due to combining electrochemical oxidation with membrane filtration shumyantseva et al 2018 wang et al 2018 and the applied voltage of 1 5 v resulted in the water decomposition thus a portion of energy was consumed to water electrolysis katuri et al 2014 as shown in fig s1 an oxidation peak 0 9 v was observed for the solution with 100 mg l bsa this result indicated that bsa could be electrochemically oxidized on the cnts hfms at voltage over 0 9 v at 0 5 v the voltage was not enough to electrochemically oxidize bsa meanwhile the phenomenon of concentration polarization on membrane surface was aggravated when the 0 5 v of applied voltage was applied on the membrane since the positively charged membrane can attract the negatively charged bsa this even led to a higher effluent bsa concentrations 69 78 mg l after 120 min filtration than that at 0 v thus 1 0 v seemed to be the optimum for bsa removal performances membrane flux variation was also another obvious evidence to assess whether membrane fouling was alleviated by reducing foulants on the membrane surface with electrochemical oxidation yang et al 2018a wang et al 2018 the flux changes with different applied voltage are presented in fig 2b when 1 0 v of applied voltage was used on cnts hfms the bsa around the membrane surface was oxidized rapidly shumyantseva et al 2018 wang et al 2018 thus a relatively higher membrane flux was obtained at 1 0 v 412 2 l bar m2 h compared to the cnts hfms without applied voltage 200 66 l bar m2 h after 120 min filtration meanwhile the membrane flux at 1 5 v 303 11 l bar m2 h was lower than that with 1 0 v because water electrolysis consumed a portion of energy katuri et al 2014 the electric energy used for oxidizing pollutants was actually less than the energy provided by 1 5 v moreover the bubbles formed on the membranes surface would hinder the water transmission which further reduced the membrane flux at 0 5 v bsa can not be degraded sufficiently adversely this voltage value accelerated the adhesion of bsa on the membrane surface shumyantseva et al 2018 wang et al 2018 which resulted in the decrease of membrane flux from 200 66 l bar m2 h 0 v to 127 31 l bar m2 h 0 5 v after 120 min filtration therefore 1 0 v was chosen as the optimum voltage applying on the embr system 3 3 wastewater treatment ability fig 3 a illustrates the cod removal of mbrs and embr at different hrts during the 61 day operation the hrts of all systems were 16 h the 1st 10th day 8 h the 11th 20th day and 4 h the 21st 61st day respectively and influent cod was set around 500 mg l in all bioreactors most of cod were mainly removed by microorganisms therefore a good effluent quality cod 50 mg l was obtained in all bioreactors during the 5th day to the 20th day first 5 days initial period of activated sludge domestication due to enough microbial concentration vss 3000 mg l and relatively long hrts 8 h however from the 21st day to the 37th day stage iii and iv the effluent cod of mbrs increased to about 78 mg l because hrt was decreased from 8 h to 4 h nevertheless in embr the effluent cod was still maintained at a relatively low level 61 mg l combined with the lower cod values in supernatant of embr around 50 mg l at hrt of 4 h than those in other two mbrs around 60 mg l at hrt of 4 h the good wastewater treatment in embr could be attributed to the enhanced aerobic microorganisms activity at 1 0 v fig s4a ding et al 2018a qian et al 2017 moreover a portion of cod could be further removed by electrochemical oxidation in embr ding et al 2018a 2018b when carbonaceous contaminants passed through the anode films electro assisted cnts hfms therefore even though at a shorter hrt of 4 h the 21st 61st day the effluent cod of embr at voltage of 1 0 v was mostly lower than 40 mg l however they were higher than 50 mg l in other two mbrs thus electrochemical effect endowed embr a better cod removal efficiency higher than 95 at hrt of 4 h and an enhanced microbial activity than those of mbrs the nh4 n concentration variations in effluent and in supernatant with the operation time in mbrs and embr were presented in fig 3b and fig s4b influent nh4 n concentration 25 mg l the effluent nh4 n in embr was always lower than those of other two mbrs during the 1st day to the 20th day a good effluent quality with nh4 n less than 2 mg l in both embr and mbrs was obtained due to relatively high vss 3000 mg l and long hrt 8 h which indicated a sufficiently utilization of nh4 n by microorganisms nevertheless the effluent nh4 n concentration of embr was also average lower about 0 5 mg l than those of mbrs combined the always relatively lower nh4 n concentration in embr than those in mbrs 2 63 mg l an enhanced microbial activity was obtained under electrochemical effect which promoted the nh4 n removal moreover a portion of nh4 n also could be further removed by electrochemical oxidation in embr ding et al 2018a 2018b when contaminants nh4 n passed through the electro assisted cnts hfms ding et al 2018a 2018b and this phenomenon was especially obvious at relatively short hrt and low vss stage iii to stage vii during the 20th day to the 40th day the nh4 n removal efficiency decreased in all bioreactors because nh4 n was insufficiently utilized by microorganisms at hrt of 4 h however in embr system the average effluent nh4 n concentration and nh4 n removal efficiency were still lower than 5 mg l and more than 80 respectively this performance was better than those results in other two mbrs with pvdf hfms and cnts hfms without electro assistance higher than 7 mg l 3 4 mitigation of membrane fouling in the embr 3 4 1 evolution of tmp fig 4 shows the tmp variations in embr and mbrs in two month operation the transmembrane pressure gradually increased over operation then dropped immediately after hydraulic cleaning at each cleaning cycle although similar tmp variation trends were observed at different experimental operating stages the time span of mbrs and embr depending on electrochemical effect and membrane properties need be considered in other words the membrane fouling trends were approximately reflected by the frequency of membrane hydraulic cleaning and according our previous studies yang et al 2018a 2018b a moderate tmp value 0 6 bar was set as the threshold tmp value to perform membrane cleaning the cnts hfms used in this study had a good hydrophilicity the average contact angle was 72 51 and interwoven network structure fig s3 good hydrophilicity was beneficial for the water film forming on the hydrophilic membrane surface which can prevent the insoluble contaminants attaching on the surface of cnts hfms and interwoven network structure further inhibited contaminants from blocking the pore channels seriously wang et al 2007 thus the pvdf hfms and cnts hfms without applied voltage were cleaned five and four times respectively however only one maintenance was conducted in embr at 1 0 v the mesh like structure fig s3 with electrochemical oxidation distributed cnts hfms in embr an excellent antifouling ability which effectively hindered pollutants from deeply blocking the membrane pores or removed them immediately ding et al 2018a qian et al 2017 yang et al 2018a 2018b and high membrane surface porosity of cnts hfms 81 table s3 endowed embr a high membrane permeate flux even at a low operation pressure the easily removable fouling was caused by loosely attached pollutants whereas irreversible membrane fouling was caused by deeply pores blocking or stronger attachment of pollutants on membrane surface fu et al 2012 meng et al 2009 after the final cleaning the tmps of pvdf hfms and cnts hfms without electro assistance were recovered to 0 15 bar and 0 09 bar respectively which were much higher than the initial levels 0 01 bar in embr the recovered tmp value was in agreement with the initial situation 0 01 bar after the same hydraulic cleaning it can be recognized that the electrochemical oxidation can remove foulants on the membrane surface or even deeply inside the membrane pores which demonstrated a positive influence on controlling irreversible membrane fouling 3 4 2 microscopic observation on the fouled membrane the fouled membranes were taken out from all mbrs at the end of the operation to visually evaluate the membrane fouling by sem images fig s5 indicates the most representative extent of membrane fouling at magnifications of 300 μm and 5 μm the surface of pvdf figs s5a and b and cnts membrane modules figs s5c and d without electro assistance were still covered by a dense cake layer even after hydraulic cleaning according to the results of tmp variation and sem images the layer covered on the pvdf hfm and cnts hfm surface without electro assistance were most likely associated with irreversible membrane fouling which heavily blocked the membrane pore sizes yang et al 2018a 2018b in contrast for the cnts hfms taken from embr the fouling was greatly mitigated in fig s5f the part of the visible mesh like structure of cnts hfms was similar as the initial state fig s3 electro assistance was the only different operational condition between mbr cnts hfms and embr cnts hfms with 1 0 v thus it can be concluded that the membrane fouling was alleviated due to direct and timely removal of contaminants mainly polysaccharides and proteins by electrochemical oxidation 3 4 3 eps contents fig s6 and fig s7 present the epsp and epsc composition and concentration of bound eps extracted from the mixed activated sludge the results indicated that eps in embr had a great difference on content rather than composition compared with those in other two mbrs the peak height value attained to the top at 1800 in embr fig s6c which was 300 higher than those in other two mbrs figs s6a and b it implied that much more bound eps in embr than in mbrs probably due to electrochemical environment chung et al 2016 li et al 2015 tian et al 2017 a consistent result was showed in fig s7 the epsp concentration was 64 86 mg l and the epsc concentration reached to 121 97 mg l at 1 0 v while the epsp and epsc concentration in mbr with pvdf hfms and mbr with cnts hfms were 51 34 mg l 107 mg l and 55 14 mg l 97 72 mg l respectively although eps are considered as the major cause of membrane fouling in mbrs they have important physiological functions in nutrient metabolism chang and lee 1998 laspidou and rittmann 2002 sheng et al 2010 in our study membrane fouling was not aggravated by more bound eps content due to electrochemical oxidation which promoted contaminant degradation instead meanwhile with respect to the eps as the main contaminant forming membrane fouling in mbrs chung et al 2016 the low eps smp concentration around the membranes made a great contribution to mitigating membrane fouling as shown in fig 5 the concentration of epsp and epsc in supernatant smp around membranes were less in embr than those in other two mbrs as amino groups in protein with positive charges can be rejected by positively charged cnts hfms in embr yang et al 2018a and the carboxylic groups and phosphoric acid groups in polysaccharide usually have negative charges which can be attracted on the membrane surface and directly oxidized the peptide bonds of protein are generally considered to be more hydrophobic than carbohydrates and the epsp would easily be adsorbed in the hydrophobic surface or pores in pvdf hfms chung et al 2016 drews et al 2007 however acidification endowed cnts hfms a better hydrophilicity average contact angle 72 51 therefore sludge flocs have a strong tendency to accumulate on pvdf hfms surface which increased the filtration resistance liu et al 2011 tian et al 2011 other studies had shown that protein could chelate with positive metal ions in the water and link into gelatinous mass which could form gel layer irreversible fouling sheng et al 2010 zhang et al 2007 and the total positive metal ions concentration of the influent was around 13 44 mg l in our study table s1 therefore another reason of electrochemical effect on alleviating membrane fouling could be attributed to repulsing positively charged metal ions thus reducing gelatinous mass attaching on membrane surface 3 4 4 flux recovery of fouled membrane by electrochemical effect in order to verify the electrochemical effect on alleviating membrane fouling 1 0 v voltage was applied on the completely fouled cnts hfms taken from mbr at the end of operation pure water flux was measured per 10 min to determine the recovery states fig 6 indicates that the fouling was mitigated gradually at the 50th min the pure water flux was recovered to 2020 87 l bar m2 h which was almost the same as that of pristine cnts hfms 2200 l bar m2 h this can be explained by the electrochemical effect which can directly oxidize pollutants on the membrane surface or in pores ding et al 2018a 2018b combined the intuitional evidence of surface morphologies when the recovery time was less than 50 min obvious pollutants layer was observed in fig 7 a e however at the 50th and the 60th min mesh like structures of cnts hfms were gradually appeared similar to the pristine state of cnts hfms which indicated a relieved membrane fouling 3 5 microbial community in the embr with the aim to assess the influence of electrochemical effect on microbial community structure and diversity of embr system activated sludge from embr was analyzed by high throughput 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing the microbial community structure of the activated sludge at initial stage and after 61 day operation were shown in fig s8 and fig s9 respectively distribution heatmap of genus level microbial communities and species diversity were presented in fig 8 as shown in fig 8a the microbial community structure at genus level in mbr pvdf hfms and mbr cnts hfms had similarity which were much different with those in embr combined with the results presented in fig s9b the content of gemmatimonas 9 09 cloacibacterium 2 99 and delftia 1 79 at genus level in embr were obvious higher than those in other two mbrs they were 6 11 4 79 0 03 0 02 and 0 01 0 002 in mbr pvdf hfms and mbr cnts hfms respectively the difference between r2 cnts hfms and r3 cnts hfms with 1 0 v was only without and with the applying voltage meanwhile the ph was maintained by nahco3 in influent therefore it could be concluded that the application of a voltage could promote microbial growth which enhance organic matter degradation by microorganisms and the electrochemical environment was much more supporting the growth of these three types microorganisms the simpson indexes of mbr pvdf hfms mbr cnts hfms and embr cnts hfms were 0 018 0 018 and 0 019 respectively shannon indexes were 5 657 5 655 and 5 839 respectively for the microbial community in embr it demonstrated that more species appeared in embr when electrochemical effect was applied on the system the more species can enhance the stability of microbial community which was beneficial for microorganism to resist harmful variation from the external environment 3 6 energy consumption energy consumption is one of the major concerns for consideration embr in a practical application for mbrs energy consumption during the operation mainly includes wastewater pumping and air supplying in our study the total energy consumption of embr was estimated to be 2 1 kwh per unit m3 of permeate according to the calculation detailed quantification procedures of pump power consumption were presented in table s4 among them 1 25 kwh per unit m3 was used for air supplying and 0 8 kwh per unit m3 was used for wastewater pumping only 0 05 kwh per unit m3 was used for electrochemical reactions previous studies indicated that the total energy consumption of mbr processes to treat domestic sewage was known to be 2 2 4 kwh per unit m3 zhang et al 2003a b and can reach up to 6 kwh per unit m3 depending on operational conditions and influent quality tsai et al 2010 our total energy consumption of embr is close to the least value of previous reports for a long term operation the removal of contaminant by electrochemical oxidation might be more effective than electrostatic repulsion with the comparable electricity energy consumption k akamatsu et al 2010 meanwhile the electrochemical oxidation could be more economical and feasible to deal with other kinds of wastewater which is not easily be utilized by microorganisms essadki et al 2008 for the case of alleviating membrane fouling with electro assistance the cnts hfms was cleaned only once during the whole operation while five and four times were needed for pvdf hfms and cnts hfms without electro assistance respectively this indicated that permeate flux loss of the cnts hfms at 1 0 v was decreased relative to that without electro assistance moreover the 0 05 kwh per unit m3 additional electrical energy consumption only accounted for 2 38 of the total energy consumption the decreases of membrane flux loss and operational costs under the electro assistance resulted in the energy savings envisaging prospect and superiority of this novel process 4 conclusions a novel aerobic treatment system was built up by combining the electrochemical oxidation with membrane filtration using the cnts hfms for wastewater treatment the electro enhanced cnts hfms presented a good antifouling and separation performance for the removal of cod and nh4 n at hrt of 4 h removal rates higher than 92 and 88 respectively moreover the membrane fouling was greatly alleviated by electrochemical oxidation via removing foulants on the membrane surface or even deeply inside the membrane pores in embr the species diversity was more complex compared with those in other two mbrs which enhanced the stability of microbial community therefore this work indicated that cnts hfms with the electrochemical oxidation applied to the mbr system were a promising method to enhance wastewater treatment performance and alleviate membrane fouling author
