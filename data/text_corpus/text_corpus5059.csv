25295,modeling and simulating tree spatial distribution in complex forests is important to ecologists and applied scientists who seek to both understand pattern creating biological processes and create realistic model forests that can be used for hypothesis testing and sampling experiments several patterns of tree spatial distribution can co occur in a forest clustering can occur due to localized patterns of growth and mortality of larger trees and corresponding regeneration of smaller trees while trees of medium size can exhibit more uniform patterns inter tree interaction may be characterized by asymmetry of competitive strength with larger individuals having a disproportionate influence on smaller individuals many point process modeling approaches exist but few have incorporated hierarchical principles that describe inter tree competition those that do sometimes assume symmetric interaction among trees which can be unrealistic none of the existing models allow for the use of different model types at each level of the hierarchy something that could provide a more realistic representation of the patterns displayed by trees of different size in this study we model and simulate a forest using a novel modular hierarchical approach that allows for the use of different model types at each hierarchy level and incorporates asymmetrical interactions as well as the effects of environmental covariates the forest is a mid successional 8 ha stem mapped oak hickory watershed in pennsylvania usa results suggest that asymmetrical interactions based on tree size do exist and these are mediated by the effects of topography the hierarchical models reproduce the spatial patterns found in the original data better than non hierarchical versions of the same models the flexibility afforded by the modularity of our modeling framework will allow simulation of forests with varying levels of complexity as well as the testing of ecological hypotheses about drivers of spatial pattern creation keywords point process models hierarchical models spatial patterns competition facilitation 1 introduction ecologists and forest managers model spatial patterns of forest trees for two main reasons to understand the processes that lead to forest community development and to understand the effects of stand spatial structure on growth of individual trees spatial patterns can be governed by a mixture of chance events and plant plant interactions mediated by environmental gradients bormann likens 1994 as competition theory suggests patterns of soil resource availability and propagules influence initial stand composition and as plants zones of influence begin to overlap competitive or facilitative hierarchies develop with interaction strength related to life history strategy plant size and interplant distances bella 1971 brooker et al 2008 schwinning weiner 1998 wu et al 1985 in mixed deciduous northern hardwood forests these processes are thought to be mediated by the effects of topography and its effects on light and soil conditions frey et al 2007 spatial pattern dynamics reflect these processes with younger stands exhibiting a more clustered pattern followed by stand homogenization as competition intensifies followed by a different type of clustered pattern as mortality and gap dynamics become important larson et al 2015 raventos et al 2010 analysis of the relationship between tree size location and environmental gradients can thus advance the science of plant community ecology by supporting existing hypotheses or suggesting new ones in cases where observed patterns and relationships do not align with current theory point process models are useful tools for studies of spatial patterns they are particularly appealing because they can be used to describe the spatial or temporal structure of a phenomenon and to create simulated point patterns based on the spatial distribution of observed points in point process modeling the set of locations of events e g tree locations is seen as one realization of a stochastic event generating process the intensities or density functions of these processes can be modeled using various families of statistical models that incorporate randomness environmental covariates and inter point interaction functions the selection of an adequate point process model depends on the system under study for example a homogeneous poisson process hpp model is typically used as a type of null model of spatial pattern descriptors for observed patterns are compared against those generated from an hpp model in order to diagnose a non random spatial distribution of points baddeley et al 2015 wiegand moloney 2014 in systems where environmental trends like topographic gradients affect patterns inhomogeneous poisson process ipp models will better describe the observed patterns e g getzin et al 2008 for applications like forest ecology where clustered patterns are common grabarnik särkkä 2009 stoyan penttinen 2000 the family of cluster models might be more appropriate finally a type of markovian model commonly referred to as a gibbs model relies on a pair potential function that specifies a set of symmetrical inter point interaction strengths and is often used for patterns where individuals are dispersed in order to incorporate in point process models the potential for asymmetric hierarchical relationships that commonly exist in forests högmander and särkkä 1999 proposed a modeling system in which the intensity of the points in the highest level of the hierarchy is modeled first using a gibbs point process model then the lower levels of the hierarchy are modeled as subsequent gibbs processes conditional on the intensity of the higher levels illian et al 2009 genet et al 2014 and grabarnik and särkkä 2009 used a similar gibbsian approach defining hierarchies by reproductive strategy the former and tree size the two latter although gibbs models have many advantages they are not suitable for the variety of clustered patterns that occur in forests baddeley et al 2015 illian et al 2008 stoyan penttinen 2000 in addition multi type gibbs models are parameterized with information about the relative strengths of interaction between individuals of different types something that might not be known to the researcher a priori baddeley et al 2015 illian et al 2009 prokešová et al 2006 wiegand moloney 2014 these difficulties suggest that gibbs models are not always suitable for modeling forest stands where a combination of different pattern types hierarchical relationships and environmental trends coexist we argue that a more flexible approach is needed to address the needs for modeling and simulating complex forests where hierarchy and different spatial patterns may co occur we propose a modular hierarchical point process modeling framework mhppf in this approach it is assumed that trees of different size classes may display different spatial patterns and thus that different families of point processes and environmental variables should be used to describe them this is achieved by the modularity of our approach at each level of the tree size based hierarchy a different model type and covariate can be used more specifically a multivariate inhomogeneous poisson or cluster process is constructed by the superposition of independent point processes that are conditioned on the cumulative point intensities of the higher levels of the hierarchy and or environmental covariates although the form of the hierarchy can be constructed following different theories or hypotheses the approach we present here assumes that trees of different size classes interact asymmetrically in the direction of decreasing size asymmetric competition is incorporated by adding the intensity of the higher levels in the hierarchy as covariates in the modeling of lower hierarchy levels that is the locations of trees lower in the hierarchy are dependent on the locations of trees at higher levels but not vice versa a generalized joint probability density associated with such a framework can be expressed as 1 f x α i 1 j f i s i θ i i f i j f i s i s i 1 s j θ i i f i j where x is the combined pattern of all levels α is a normalizing constant i is the hierarchy level 1 is the lowest and the smallest tree size class j is the number of levels si is the intensity of the level i pattern and θ i is the vector of parameters associated with the environmental covariates associated with the intensity of the level i pattern simulation is achieved by performing the modeling and simulation sequentially based on the hierarchy of point types incorporating the simulated intensity surfaces from higher levels as inputs in the form of covariates to the simulation process at lower levels in the current study we lay out the methods for implementing this approach demonstrate its application by modeling a mapped stand of trees in central pennsylvania usa and compare results of this new approach to a method that does not incorporate hierarchical principles we hypothesized that trees of different size classes would exhibit different types of spatial patterns and that these patterns would be related to not only the presence of larger trees but also to environmental covariates specifically we hypothesized that in this mid successional forest smaller trees would be clustered and larger trees would show a more hyper dispersed pattern and that the mhppf would allow us to simulate realistic tree spatial patterns in this complex forest 2 methods 2 1 study site and data mapped tree data for this study were obtained from the susquehanna shale hills critical zone observatory sshczo kaye et al 2015 an approximately 8 ha watershed found in the ridge and valley physiographic region of central pennsylvania usa fig 1 the watershed is oriented east west with predominantly north and south facing aspects and an elevation range of 240 300 m above sea level tree information for 2050 trees was collected in 2012 and included geographic location obtained using a survey grade gps and data logger species and diameter at breast height dbh to the nearest 0 254 cm 0 1 in for trees greater than 20 32 cm 8 in kaye et al 2015 naithani et al 2013 wubbles 2010 to define each hierarchy level trees were grouped into diameter classes with the assumption that dbh is related to competitive strength and thus different sized trees may display different spatial patterns to create tree size groupings the jenks optimization procedure found in the classint package for version 3 3 3 of the r statistical software bivand 2015 jenks caspall 1971 r core team 2015 was used we chose the jenks method because it provides a site specific way to classify dbh into natural groups that are internally homogeneous relative to other potential groupings making it a generic approach for conducting this type of analysis in new forest ecosystems with different dbh distributions the four dbh class boundaries identified by this method were as follows 20 3 29 1 n 744 29 2 37 6 n 682 37 7 48 5 n 442 and 48 6 cm n 182 the convention we use here is that large diameter classes represent higher levels in the competitive hierarchy i e level 4 is the highest level of the hierarchy and level 1 is the lowest to evaluate the potential effect of topographic gradients on the spatial patterns of the different size class trees we evaluated elevation usgs 2010 percent slope and transformed aspect beers et al 1966 all of which were based on a 3 m pixel digital elevation model dem and generated using the spatial analyst extension of arcgis desktop software esri 2014 in addition two topographic indices were generated using the terrain function of the raster package of r hijmans 2015 topographic position index tpi and topographic ruggedness index tri wilson et al 2007 tpi represents an index of relative slope position and tri is an index of local topographic complexity all dem based variables were smoothed using the focal mean function applied in a 5 5 pixel window in r s raster package hijmans 2015 to incorporate potential tree size mediated competition effects fixed bandwidth kernel estimates of the intensity surfaces of levels 1 4 individually 1 2 1 2 3 2 3 2 3 4 and 3 4 were created the kernel estimation method is a neighborhood based spatial interpolation that weights neighbors using an isotropic gaussian smoothing kernel with standard deviation of 15 m the size of the smoothing kernel was chosen using a cross validation approach described by berman and diggle 1989 these intensity surfaces were then evaluated as covariates in the respective hierarchy level model 2 2 baseline analysis to characterize patterns in order to choose the best point process family at each level of the hierarchy dbh class we conducted assessments using the spatstat package for r statistical software baddeley et al 2015 r core team 2015 we first determined if the observed patterns for each dbh class exhibited evidence for complete spatial randomness csr hyper dispersion or clustering by comparing the observed values of three second order pattern descriptors the pair correlation statistic g wiegand moloney 2014 besag s l besag 1977 and the nearest neighbor statistic g wiegand moloney 2014 to simulation envelopes created from 99 realizations of a csr pattern with the same number of points if the observed functions fell within the simulation envelopes this suggested csr if the functions fell above them this suggested clustering if they fell below this suggested a hyper dispersed or inhibited pattern baddeley et al 2015 we used two sided maximum absolute deviation tests baddeley et al 2014 to assess the significance of any departure of the true value of the function from the simulation envelope within a 15 m analysis window next we assessed the relationships between the point intensity of each hierarchy level and the topographic covariates described above we used two approaches for this assessment relative distribution estimates baddeley 2010 baddeley turner 2005 and kolmogorov smirnov ks tests berman 1986 the former describes the relationship between the point pattern and the covariates and the latter tests if there is a non random association between the point pattern and the covariate 2 3 model development and selection based on results of the baseline analyses we implemented the mhppf we first modeled the highest level of the hierarchy level 4 by evaluating the families of point process models suggested by the baseline analysis and considering only the topographic variables as covariates models for the next lower levels 3 2 and 1 respectively were built by choosing the best combination of point process model family topographic covariates and estimated intensity surfaces from points of the higher levels of the hierarchy model parameters were estimated using the spatstat implementation of berman turner maximum likelihood for poisson processes and the minimum contrast method for cluster processes baddeley et al 2015 to select the best model within each hierarchy level we used the mimetic approach of goreaud et al 2004 in this approach metrics for sets of simulated patterns created from each of the candidate models were compared to those from the original data using simulation envelope tests as guides rather than hard and fast rules baddeley et al 2015 wiegand moloney 2014 best models were chosen using three criteria first we preferred models where observed values were mostly contained within the simulation envelopes second if two candidate models were similar in this respect we chose the model where higher level intensity surfaces were included finally with these criteria met we followed the parsimony principle and preferred models that were simpler for example homogeneous models are simpler than inhomogeneous models poisson models are simpler than cluster models and using elevation is simpler than using elevation derivatives as covariates simulations were performed with the metropolis hastings simulation algorithm baddeley turner 2006 geyer moller 1994 for simulating patterns below level 4 we used the chosen models from the next higher levels to create simulated patterns then generated the associated point intensity surfaces from these simulated patterns and finally used these simulated patterns as the covariates this process is summarized in fig 2 to assess whether the simulated patterns reflected the relationships between the observed point patterns and topography we created relative distribution functions using only elevation as a topographic variable because we considered it a surrogate for the other dem based variables for comparisons using second order statistics we used homogeneous versions of the l g and g functions to assess whether the characteristics of the combined multi type pattern reproduced the observed inter level spatial relationships we conducted bivariate tests using the homogeneous l and g functions baddeley et al 2015 every pair combination of hierarchical levels was evaluated i e 4 3 4 2 2 1 to evaluate whether the incorporation of higher level intensity surfaces used to reflect asymmetric competitive effects improved upon non hierarchical models we repeated the bivariate assessment of the final model using another set of models these new models used the same point process model type and topographic covariates previously selected but did not include the intensity surfaces from the other levels we then compared the non hierarchical versions of the models against those from the mhppf for all tests 48 realizations of each candidate model were generated this number was chosen due to the large number of candidate models being evaluated time requirements when performing each simulation of large point patterns and the fact that the parallel processing algorithm we used to expedite our analysis used a server with 16 cores thus 3 realizations were generated on each core and results were pooled to arrive at a total of 48 unique simulated patterns for each candidate model and for each test 3 results 3 1 baseline analysis the locations of trees from each hierarchy level as well as these superimposed on kernel density estimates can be seen in fig 1 smaller trees hierarchy levels 1 and 2 appear in most parts of the watershed and seem to exhibit a non random clustered pattern level 3 shows a more hyper dispersed pattern with fewer obvious clusters and level 4 exhibits a more geographically restricted pattern with most trees in the central portion of the study area corresponding with lower elevations two sided maximum absolute deviation tests using the homogeneous second order function g g and l simulation envelopes indicated that the summary function for the observed pattern of levels 1 and 4 does not follow a csr pattern for at least one of the summary functions p 0 05 the values for the function for the observed patterns fall above the average of the csr derived summary functions for the majority of the radii assessed suggesting an aggregated pattern at multiple scales of observation fig 3 for levels 2 and 3 however results provide evidence of a pattern more closely resembling an hpp fig 3 an example of plots of the relative distribution functions developed to assess the relationships between the intensities of the patterns for each dbh class and the candidate covariates is shown in fig 4 the observed point patterns for all hierarchy levels were related to at least one of the topographic variables with elevation playing a strong role fig 4a fig 4b shows relative distribution functions that reveal the relationship between intensity of points at higher levels of the hierarchy and the lower level patterns the intensity of points at level 4 displays a positive correlation with that of level 3 however the intensity of the combination of levels 4 and 3 do not display a strong relationship with that of level 2 finally the cumulative intensity of levels 4 3 and 2 has a strong negative relationship with that of level 1 results of the ks tests can be seen in table 1 significant results indicate that there is evidence of a non random relationship between patterns of points at a given level of the hierarchy with those of the candidate covariates for the candidate topographic variables levels 1 and 4 show non random relationships whereas for levels 2 and 3 there are fewer and weaker significant results 3 2 model development and selection based on results of our baseline analysis we evaluated for each hierarchy level the set of models presented in table 2 an example of the different second order statistical and relative distribution functions for two competing models for level 4 can be seen in fig 5 fig 5a d are an example of the mimetic tests of the l g g and relative distribution functions respectively for the chosen model for hierarchy level 4 and e h are those for an hpp model which does not track the observed data as well in many cases however the different models that included covariates performed similarly or there was a lack of agreement among the summary functions as to which model was better the models ultimately chosen for each hierarchy level are presented in table 3 results of all of the bivariate l function tests that included level 1 can be seen in fig 6 summary functions from the mhppf a c were closer to those of the observed data than were those from the non hierarchical no competition models d f this effect is particularly prominent with bivariate l functions for the level 1 4 pairs c vs f 4 discussion in the study area we assumed a traditional model of secondary forest development and built our mhppf accordingly implicit in eq 1 and fig 2 is the well supported assumption that there is an underlying competitive hierarchy mediated by environmental patterns that leads to the spatial structure of many forest communities bormann likens 1994 important processes in forest succession commonly include competition niche differentiation along environmental gradients and some combination of continuous or episodic growth and mortality due to life history strategies and chance events a useful feature of mhppf is that it allows for the modeling of these and other types of interactions like facilitation in an arid environment for example we might hypothesize a mixture of competition for scarce moisture among dominant individuals and a facilitative relationship between these and smaller individuals or other species that exploit shading or understory detritus accumulation proffered by the larger plants similarly impacts of random events can be included using either the hpp or the ipp at any level in the process finally variation in interaction strength among individuals based on any categorical attribute such as a combination of age and size can be incorporated allowing for different model types at each hierarchy level effects of random events and incorporation of either positive or negative effects of other hierarchy levels as covariates thus allows researchers to determine whether observed patterns align with various types of hypotheses and assumptions about plant community development the types and forms of the models that according to our selection criteria best described the tree spatial pattern at each hierarchy level align with our hypotheses of pattern formation in this system for example for larger trees levels 4 and 3 the best performing model was a simple ipp driven by elevation table 3 in both cases higher elevation corresponded with decreased point intensity indicating that larger trees occur more commonly in the valley than at the ridge tops according to parameter estimates of the chosen models table 3 the elevation effect is larger for the trees in level 4 than for the trees in level 3 suggesting that effects of topography related biological processes differ by tree size this is also clearly seen in figs 1 and 7 the selected levels 4 and 3 models also align with evidence that soil quality and light differences along topographic gradients strongly influence patterns of tree growth and establishment in the sshczo frey et al 2007 naithani et al 2013 smith et al 2017 wubbles 2010 our chosen level 2 model is consistent with our initial hypothesis of pattern formation from competition effects mediated by topography and with the findings of smith et al 2017 who found higher mean per tree biomass increment in swales due to their higher level of soil organic matter the level 2 model indicates that as local topographic complexity tri increases as would tend to occur around swales density of the patterns of level 2 trees decreases at the same time ks tests table 1 and relative distribution functions indicated that there is a significant positive relationship between tri and the pattern of large trees it is thus not completely clear from our analysis if competition from larger individuals or topography most affects the pattern of smaller trees however we performed a likelihood ratio test to determine if a more complex model that contained both the impacts of the intensity of larger trees and of tri was superior to one with just tri results indicated that the complex model that included impacts from the point intensities of levels 3 and 4 was superior p 0 005 further supporting the hypothesis of multiple drivers of pattern bormann and likens 1994 and canham et al 2004 point out that in mature forests canopy gaps and associated higher light and soil resource availability lead to clustered patterns of smaller trees competing to reach the canopy our chosen level 1 model agrees with this hypothesis cluster locations parent points were created by an hpp with locations of trees within clusters having a negative relationship with the presence of the largest tree size classes there was a negative relationship between the points within clusters and slope as well suggesting that topography could play an impact perhaps indirectly since ks tests table 1 and relative distribution functions indicate a significant positive relationship between slope percentage and larger trees analytically distinguishing a true cluster process from an ipp driven by environmental gradients is difficult because second order statistical functions like the l g and g functions from both types of patterns can have similar forms wiegand moloney 2014 similarly it is difficult to distinguish the effects of hierarchical competitive interactions from those of environmental trends because there is often collinearity between different levels of the hierarchy and environmental covariates however we found that including the effects of the patterns of larger trees as covariates improved the performance of the overall model with respect to the maintenance of bivariate spatial relationships when compared to models with only topography fig 6 this as well as the aforementioned results from the models of the individual levels further illustrates how the mhppf can be used to incorporate effects of multiple processes in models of stand spatial pattern the advantage of the mhppf over existing methods is that it allows for a certain plasticity and modularity that does not exist in other techniques that rely on only one family of point process models relying solely on gibbsian models to construct a hierarchical framework as did grabarnik and särkkä 2009 högmander and särkkä 1999 and illian et al 2009 would not have allowed us to superimpose processes of very different types in a straightforward manner the modularity of the mhppf allows the practitioner to model any combination of csr clustering or hyper dispersion for patterns of different types with any combination of hierarchical relationships depending upon the unique requirements of the ecosystem under study 5 conclusions we analyzed multiple co occurring tree size related spatial patterns in a mature second growth forest by developing a novel hierarchical modeling framework that allows for each of the spatial patterns to be described by a different point process model family based on the dominant biological processes at each level of the hierarchy the spatial pattern of large trees was related to elevation while the pattern of mid sized trees was related to topographic complexity and competition effects the spatial pattern of the smallest sized trees was clustered and affected by competition from larger size trees and slope the mhppf can be used to examine hypotheses about ecological processes affecting stand structure and create realistic simulated tree patterns

spatial interpolation that weights neighbors using an isotropic gaussian smoothing kernel with standard deviation of 15 m the size of the smoothing kernel was chosen using a cross validation approach described by berman and diggle 1989 these intensity surfaces were then evaluated as covariates in the respective hierarchy level model 2 2 baseline analysis to characterize patterns in order to choose the best point process family at each level of the hierarchy dbh class we conducted assessments using the spatstat package for r statistical software baddeley et al 2015 r core team 2015 we first determined if the observed patterns for each dbh class exhibited evidence for complete spatial randomness csr hyper dispersion or clustering by comparing the observed values of three second order pattern descriptors the pair correlation statistic g wiegand moloney 2014 besag s l besag 1977 and the nearest neighbor statistic g wiegand moloney 2014 to simulation envelopes created from 99 realizations of a csr pattern with the same number of points if the observed functions fell within the simulation envelopes this suggested csr if the functions fell above them this suggested clustering if they fell below this suggested a hyper dispersed or inhibited pattern baddeley et al 2015 we used two sided maximum absolute deviation tests baddeley et al 2014 to assess the significance of any departure of the true value of the function from the simulation envelope within a 15 m analysis window next we assessed the relationships between the point intensity of each hierarchy level and the topographic covariates described above we used two approaches for this assessment relative distribution estimates baddeley 2010 baddeley turner 2005 and kolmogorov smirnov ks tests berman 1986 the former describes the relationship between the point pattern and the covariates and the latter tests if there is a non random association between the point pattern and the covariate 2 3 model development and selection based on results of the baseline analyses we implemented the mhppf we first modeled the highest level of the hierarchy level 4 by evaluating the families of point process models suggested by the baseline analysis and considering only the topographic variables as covariates models for the next lower levels 3 2 and 1 respectively were built by choosing the best combination of point process model family topographic covariates and estimated intensity surfaces from points of the higher levels of the hierarchy model parameters were estimated using the spatstat implementation of berman turner maximum likelihood for poisson processes and the minimum contrast method for cluster processes baddeley et al 2015 to select the best model within each hierarchy level we used the mimetic approach of goreaud et al 2004 in this approach metrics for sets of simulated patterns created from each of the candidate models were compared to those from the original data using simulation envelope tests as guides rather than hard and fast rules baddeley et al 2015 wiegand moloney 2014 best models were chosen using three criteria first we preferred models where observed values were mostly contained within the simulation envelopes second if two candidate models were similar in this respect we chose the model where higher level intensity surfaces were included finally with these criteria met we followed the parsimony principle and preferred models that were simpler for example homogeneous models are simpler than inhomogeneous models poisson models are simpler than cluster models and using elevation is simpler than using elevation derivatives as covariates simulations were performed with the metropolis hastings simulation algorithm baddeley turner 2006 geyer moller 1994 for simulating patterns below level 4 we used the chosen models from the next higher levels to create simulated patterns then generated the associated point intensity surfaces from these simulated patterns and finally used these simulated patterns as the covariates this process is summarized in fig 2 to assess whether the simulated patterns reflected the relationships between the observed point patterns and topography we created relative distribution functions using only elevation as a topographic variable because we considered it a surrogate for the other dem based variables for comparisons using second order statistics we used homogeneous versions of the l g and g functions to assess whether the characteristics of the combined multi type pattern reproduced the observed inter level spatial relationships we conducted bivariate tests using the homogeneous l and g functions baddeley et al 2015 every pair combination of hierarchical levels was evaluated i e 4 3 4 2 2 1 to evaluate whether the incorporation of higher level intensity surfaces used to reflect asymmetric competitive effects improved upon non hierarchical models we repeated the bivariate assessment of the final model using another set of models these new models used the same point process model type and topographic covariates previously selected but did not include the intensity surfaces from the other levels we then compared the non hierarchical versions of the models against those from the mhppf for all tests 48 realizations of each candidate model were generated this number was chosen due to the large number of candidate models being evaluated time requirements when performing each simulation of large point patterns and the fact that the parallel processing algorithm we used to expedite our analysis used a server with 16 cores thus 3 realizations were generated on each core and results were pooled to arrive at a total of 48 unique simulated patterns for each candidate model and for each test 3 results 3 1 baseline analysis the locations of trees from each hierarchy level as well as these superimposed on kernel density estimates can be seen in fig 1 smaller trees hierarchy levels 1 and 2 appear in most parts of the watershed and seem to exhibit a non random clustered pattern level 3 shows a more hyper dispersed pattern with fewer obvious clusters and level 4 exhibits a more geographically restricted pattern with most trees in the central portion of the study area corresponding with lower elevations two sided maximum absolute deviation tests using the homogeneous second order function g g and l simulation envelopes indicated that the summary function for the observed pattern of levels 1 and 4 does not follow a csr pattern for at least one of the summary functions p 0 05 the values for the function for the observed patterns fall above the average of the csr derived summary functions for the majority of the radii assessed suggesting an aggregated pattern at multiple scales of observation fig 3 for levels 2 and 3 however results provide evidence of a pattern more closely resembling an hpp fig 3 an example of plots of the relative distribution functions developed to assess the relationships between the intensities of the patterns for each dbh class and the candidate covariates is shown in fig 4 the observed point patterns for all hierarchy levels were related to at least one of the topographic variables with elevation playing a strong role fig 4a fig 4b shows relative distribution functions that reveal the relationship between intensity of points at higher levels of the hierarchy and the lower level patterns the intensity of points at level 4 displays a positive correlation with that of level 3 however the intensity of the combination of levels 4 and 3 do not display a strong relationship with that of level 2 finally the cumulative intensity of levels 4 3 and 2 has a strong negative relationship with that of level 1 results of the ks tests can be seen in table 1 significant results indicate that there is evidence of a non random relationship between patterns of points at a given level of the hierarchy with those of the candidate covariates for the candidate topographic variables levels 1 and 4 show non random relationships whereas for levels 2 and 3 there are fewer and weaker significant results 3 2 model development and selection based on results of our baseline analysis we evaluated for each hierarchy level the set of models presented in table 2 an example of the different second order statistical and relative distribution functions for two competing models for level 4 can be seen in fig 5 fig 5a d are an example of the mimetic tests of the l g g and relative distribution functions respectively for the chosen model for hierarchy level 4 and e h are those for an hpp model which does not track the observed data as well in many cases however the different models that included covariates performed similarly or there was a lack of agreement among the summary functions as to which model was better the models ultimately chosen for each hierarchy level are presented in table 3 results of all of the bivariate l function tests that included level 1 can be seen in fig 6 summary functions from the mhppf a c were closer to those of the observed data than were those from the non hierarchical no competition models d f this effect is particularly prominent with bivariate l functions for the level 1 4 pairs c vs f 4 discussion in the study area we assumed a traditional model of secondary forest development and built our mhppf accordingly implicit in eq 1 and fig 2 is the well supported assumption that there is an underlying competitive hierarchy mediated by environmental patterns that leads to the spatial structure of many forest communities bormann likens 1994 important processes in forest succession commonly include competition niche differentiation along environmental gradients and some combination of continuous or episodic growth and mortality due to life history strategies and chance events a useful feature of mhppf is that it allows for the modeling of these and other types of interactions like facilitation in an arid environment for example we might hypothesize a mixture of competition for scarce moisture among dominant individuals and a facilitative relationship between these and smaller individuals or other species that exploit shading or understory detritus accumulation proffered by the larger plants similarly impacts of random events can be included using either the hpp or the ipp at any level in the process finally variation in interaction strength among individuals based on any categorical attribute such as a combination of age and size can be incorporated allowing for different model types at each hierarchy level effects of random events and incorporation of either positive or negative effects of other hierarchy levels as covariates thus allows researchers to determine whether observed patterns align with various types of hypotheses and assumptions about plant community development the types and forms of the models that according to our selection criteria best described the tree spatial pattern at each hierarchy level align with our hypotheses of pattern formation in this system for example for larger trees levels 4 and 3 the best performing model was a simple ipp driven by elevation table 3 in both cases higher elevation corresponded with decreased point intensity indicating that larger trees occur more commonly in the valley than at the ridge tops according to parameter estimates of the chosen models table 3 the elevation effect is larger for the trees in level 4 than for the trees in level 3 suggesting that effects of topography related biological processes differ by tree size this is also clearly seen in figs 1 and 7 the selected levels 4 and 3 models also align with evidence that soil quality and light differences along topographic gradients strongly influence patterns of tree growth and establishment in the sshczo frey et al 2007 naithani et al 2013 smith et al 2017 wubbles 2010 our chosen level 2 model is consistent with our initial hypothesis of pattern formation from competition effects mediated by topography and with the findings of smith et al 2017 who found higher mean per tree biomass increment in swales due to their higher level of soil organic matter the level 2 model indicates that as local topographic complexity tri increases as would tend to occur around swales density of the patterns of level 2 trees decreases at the same time ks tests table 1 and relative distribution functions indicated that there is a significant positive relationship between tri and the pattern of large trees it is thus not completely clear from our analysis if competition from larger individuals or topography most affects the pattern of smaller trees however we performed a likelihood ratio test to determine if a more complex model that contained both the impacts of the intensity of larger trees and of tri was superior to one with just tri results indicated that the complex model that included impacts from the point intensities of levels 3 and 4 was superior p 0 005 further supporting the hypothesis of multiple drivers of pattern bormann and likens 1994 and canham et al 2004 point out that in mature forests canopy gaps and associated higher light and soil resource availability lead to clustered patterns of smaller trees competing to reach the canopy our chosen level 1 model agrees with this hypothesis cluster locations parent points were created by an hpp with locations of trees within clusters having a negative relationship with the presence of the largest tree size classes there was a negative relationship between the points within clusters and slope as well suggesting that topography could play an impact perhaps indirectly since ks tests table 1 and relative distribution functions indicate a significant positive relationship between slope percentage and larger trees analytically distinguishing a true cluster process from an ipp driven by environmental gradients is difficult because second order statistical functions like the l g and g functions from both types of patterns can have similar forms wiegand moloney 2014 similarly it is difficult to distinguish the effects of hierarchical competitive interactions from those of environmental trends because there is often collinearity between different levels of the hierarchy and environmental covariates however we found that including the effects of the patterns of larger trees as covariates improved the performance of the overall model with respect to the maintenance of bivariate spatial relationships when compared to models with only topography fig 6 this as well as the aforementioned results from the models of the individual levels further illustrates how the mhppf can be used to incorporate effects of multiple processes in models of stand spatial pattern the advantage of the mhppf over existing methods is that it allows for a certain plasticity and modularity that does not exist in other techniques that rely on only one family of point process models relying solely on gibbsian models to construct a hierarchical framework as did grabarnik and särkkä 2009 högmander and särkkä 1999 and illian et al 2009 would not have allowed us to superimpose processes of very different types in a straightforward manner the modularity of the mhppf allows the practitioner to model any combination of csr clustering or hyper dispersion for patterns of different types with any combination of hierarchical relationships depending upon the unique requirements of the ecosystem under study 5 conclusions we analyzed multiple co occurring tree size related spatial patterns in a mature second growth forest by developing a novel hierarchical modeling framework that allows for each of the spatial patterns to be described by a different point process model family based on the dominant biological processes at each level of the hierarchy the spatial pattern of large trees was related to elevation while the pattern of mid sized trees was related to topographic complexity and competition effects the spatial pattern of the smallest sized trees was clustered and affected by competition from larger size trees and slope the mhppf can be used to examine hypotheses about ecological processes affecting stand structure and create realistic simulated tree patterns

25296,climate and weather affect avian migration by influencing when and where birds fly the energy costs and risks of flight and the ability to sense cues necessary for proper navigation we review the literature of the physiology of avian migration and the influence of climate specifically temperature on avian migration dynamics we use waterfowl as a model guild because of the ready availability of empirical physiological data and their enormous economic value but our discussion and expectations are broadly generalizable to migratory birds in general we detail potential consequences of an increasingly warm climate on avian migration including the possibility of the cessation of migration by some populations and species our intent is to lay the groundwork for including temperature effects on energetic gains and losses of migratory birds with the expected consequences of increasing temperatures into a predictive modeling framework to this end we provide a simulation of migration progression exclusively focused on the influence of temperature on the physiological determinants of migration this simulation produced comparable results to empirically derived and observed values for different migratory factors e g body fat content flight range departure date by merging knowledge from the arenas of avian physiology and migratory theory we have identified a clear need for research and have developed hypotheses for a path forward keywords climate change metabolic rate migration physiology waterfowl 1 introduction each year hundreds of millions of birds from hundreds of species complete migratory journeys across continents and oceans punctuated by periods of breeding and over wintering the multi species spatiotemporal aspects of these global events provide a unique opportunity to assess the ecology of geographically disparate behaviorally connected environments that is avian migration and its associated components e g number of migrants duration survivorship can serve as an integrative bio indicator for changing conditions across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales gordo and sanz 2006 culp et al 2017 lópez hoffman et al 2017 many migratory species are experiencing declines in abundance and in some cases long distance migrants are more likely to experience declines than short distance migrants or residents zöckler et al 2003 vickery et al 2014 the migration phenomenon itself is imperiled as a result of changing land cover and climate wilcove and wikelski 2008 runge et al 2015 given an increasing body of evidence surrounding the occurrence and consequences of global climate change e g walther et al 2002 karl and trenberth 2003 hansen and sato 2016 rigorous and robust techniques are required for

wikelski 2008 national wildlife federation 2013 national audubon society 2014 berchtold et al 2017 in terms of migration dynamics a strong case can be made for temperature being the most influential of climate change related environmental factors smith and prince 1973 klaassen 1996 piersma 2002 gordo 2007 swanson 2010 metabolic rate is closely tied to temperature dictating whether an organism can operate at its lowest metabolic rate in its thermal neutral zone or if it must expend energy to either cool down sweat pant increase blood flow to extremities or heat up shiver burn fat constrict blood flow food availability and its subsequent utility as energy will dictate the success of a migrant in reaching its goal temperature influences energy availability through plant phenology gordo and sanz 2006 knudsen et al 2011 teitelbaum et al 2015 precipitation and wind currents are also altered by temperature other potentially important factors like photoperiod or genetics which have strong influences on the timing of migration departure are inert relative to climate change and therefore of little interest in terms of forecasting changes brought about by a changing climate thus focusing on the role temperature plays in shaping avian migration patterns and how those patterns might be expected to change as temperature generally increases is clearly a valuable endeavor we note that each of these other considerations is worthy of its own dedicated investigation but we exclude them from further consideration here in terms of the behavioral responses to changing temperatures recent studies have shown an increased tendency for sedentary behavior given sufficient feeding throughout the winter as temperatures in breeding grounds remain sufficiently warm wilcove and wikelski 2008 visser et al 2009 knudsen et al 2011 robinson et al 2016 berchtold et al 2017 indeed the occurrence of partially migratory species and populations is well founded barta et al 2008 and it is reasonable to believe that in a warmer climate it may be evolutionarily advantageous to stay in place rather than suffer the reduced survivorship of a migratory journey wilcove and wikelski 2008 visser et al 2009 berchtold et al 2017 species that seem to have an immutable instinct to migrate regardless of the temperature at their breeding grounds are also highly susceptible to the repercussions of a changing climate walther et al 2002 sanz aguilar et al 2012 while migration still takes place in these species the routes they take and dynamics they display along the way are being modified as the atmosphere warms and the timing of these migration events is changing as well largely occurring earlier in the spring and later in the fall to match the shifting patterns of plant growth and production jonzén et al 2006 2007 gordo 2007 si et al 2015 however there are reproductive obstacles that appear to represent fixed deadlines for when breeding can occur so even though migration timing shifts to match the phenology of forage when birds reach their breeding grounds they are still faced with the challenge of trying to produce offspring within a prescribed window of time both and visser 2001 both et al 2004 2010 arzel et al 2006 si et al 2015 additionally for some species a breeding season extended by warmer temperatures is prompting some individuals to produce extra clutches gordo 2007 knudsen et al 2011 putting pressure on parents to fledge that final clutch faster so as to depart for the return trip before intolerable conditions set in in this paper we review the literature related to the energetics of migration and the interaction of migration and temperature we seek to explicate the effects of temperature on energetic gains and losses during migration with an eye toward accounting for warmer atmospheric temperatures our aim is to connect the extensive literature of physiological investigations into the dynamics of bird metabolism with the rich and rapidly expanding literature of avian migration the litany of species participating in annual migratory cycles includes a wide range of associated habitat types and ecosystems e g passerine forest birds and grassland birds coastal shorebirds and pelagic seabirds wetland waterfowl and birds of prey while all of these taxa and landscapes require conservation and management attention we focus on waterfowl and the wetlands they use we stress that while we parameterize the model we develop for waterfowl it is readily generalizable for migratory birds in general given the availability of requisite data waterfowl are a heavily managed group national wildlife federation 2013 national audubon society 2014 and have been equally heavily studied in terms of their physiology and flight dynamics pennycuick 1975 whyte and bolen 1988 lindström and kvist 1995 van wijk et al 2012 thorup et al 2014 thus we use waterfowl as a model to form our specific expectations for the effects of temperature on energetic dynamics but these expectations are conceptually applicable to avian migration in general we leverage the available literature to explore the selective forces acting on migrants via the suite of available migratory strategies we introduce a simulation modeling framework to evaluate the effects of climate change especially varying temperature on the energetic gains and losses of migrants during their migratory journeys giving particular attention to the connections between temperature metabolism and migration finally we elaborate on the factors of selection acting on each strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 thermal energetics of migration in a classic review alerstam and lindström 1990 consider the consequences of what they call the selective forces of avian migration time energy and predation a fourth selective force fitting neatly in this group is competition each of these forces is sensitive to changes in temperature some more directly than others see fig 1 for instance temperature affects migration directly by modifying metabolic requirements smith and prince 1973 klaassen 1996 piersma 2002 swanson 2010 and body mass in terms of fat load witter and cuthill 1993 and see citations therein establishing the connection between increasing fat reserves with decreasing temperatures a successful or optimal as in alerstam and lindström 1990 migratory strategy minimizes or optimizes the selective forces of migration as much as possible the magnitude of influence of the selective forces of migration can be modified according to behaviorally influenced variables departure date flight velocity stopover time and fat reserves the main energy source for flight i e fuel level each of these variables can be thought of on a spectrum early to late departure slow to fast flight velocity short to long stopover time lean to ample fat reserves along which individuals in the population are distributed pennycuick 1975 alerstam and lindström 1990 hedenström 1992 bruderer and boldt 2001 drent et al 2003 pennycuick and battley 2003 la sorte et al 2013 pennycuick et al 2013 selection acts to craft migration strategies by occupying points on each of these spectra and the overall strategies correspond to an optimization scheme of the selective forces which selective forces are minimized in a given strategy is a function of the intensity of selection on each variable in general time minimization is considered the strongest selective force over the course of migration alerstam and lindström 1990 weber and houston 1997 optimal migration however requires several smaller scale minimization optimization strategies operating at the level of flight jumps and stopovers rather than over the entire migration journey considering all of these small scale strategies it becomes clear that time minimization is not globally optimal in all contexts weber et al 1998 additionally tradeoffs between the behavioral variables associated with migration are inter related and deal with various combinations of the components of migratory flight but mainly concern whether to conserve energy or accept higher risks as such we will consider the consequences of minimizing time predation risk or competitive effects relative to the increased energetic costs accompanying each of the smaller scale strategies here 2 2 considering uncertainty in parameter estimates we modelled the temperature related energetics of migration deterministically informing estimates for relevant parameters using literature derived values and substituting missing information with empirical formulae where necessary we emphasize that this effort is ab initio or a first principles effort in developing an energetics based migration model so future work exploring parametric uncertainty environmental stochasticity and model sensitivity would be a natural progression to this study this eventual elaboration is especially important given the myriad sources of unpredictability for the birds themselves e g extreme weather events variable predation and hunter harvest using this energetic based model as a testbed though we can begin to explore in a systematic fashion the differential effects of uncertainty and variation in migration after explicating the model we briefly review important aspects of model uncertainty worthy of initial follow up investigation 2 3 modeling a single migration trajectory 2 3 1 temperature and metabolism many investigations into the dynamics of the metabolic curve for waterfowl have been performed lasiewski and dawson 1967 hartung 1967 zar 1968 smith and prince 1973 miller 1984 daan et al 1990 klaassen 1996 and we can leverage these data to inform relatively simple algebraic relations of metabolism temperature and flight ultimately generating theoretical migration schedules sensu drent et al 2003 by manipulating temperature in these simulated schedules we create expectations for the effects of changing temperature on migration strategies we therefore begin this section with a brief overview of the quantitative connection between temperature and metabolism and its ramifications on the cost of flight and migration schedules for each equation presented we provide the definitions of variables and values in table 1 used to parameterize the subsequent simulation for a mallard anas platyrhynchos like dabbling duck metabolically there are two segments of thermal influence one occurring above and the other below species specific temperature limits the upper uct and lower lct critical temperatures respectively above approximately 20 c with a range of 18 25 c jorde et al 1984 prince 1979 smith and prince 1973 most waterfowl exhibit an equilibrium metabolic rate r that is heat production is balanced by heat lost to the environment this is the thermal neutral zone tnz in fig 2 within the tnz metabolic rate is insensitive to changes in ta and is tightly correlated with body mass following the well known 3 4ths power law convention the general equation to quantify the contribution of temperature to metabolic rate is 1 r α β t a σ m λ γ t a t a l c t l c t t a u c t t a u c t where r is the temperature dependent whether above or below lct metabolic rate α and β represent the intercept and slope below the tnz respectively and γ represents the slope above the tnz ta is ambient temperature in c and m is body mass temperatures exceeding the upper critical temperature are most likely to be encountered during breeding rather than in migration therefore we dispense with further discussion of this aspect and focus instead on the lower temperatures encouraging movement along a temperature gradient that is more conducive to maintaining the thermal neutral zone while all of the literature derived estimates for σ and λ are roughly similar see table 1 and references therein the values from heitmeyer 2010 represents the most rigorous of the estimates and are likely to be the most accurate see miller and eadie 2006 we use heitmeyer s 2010 estimate of r in the tnz with prince s 1979 approach below the lct as this is a reasonable representation of the relationship between temperature and metabolic rate other representations are however possible e g mckinney and mcwilliams 2005 metabolism and flight cost experimentally determined estimates for the cost of flight per unit time ct have been available for decades and are often conceived of as simple multiples of metabolic rate prince 1979 whyte and bolen 1988 castro and myers 1988 the common correlation is 2 c t a r where a is a generic coefficient cost of flight per unit time can be converted to the cost of flight per unit distance cd productive energy in fig 2 via 3 c d c t v given 75 km hr flight velocity v and assuming ambient temperatures above lct i e using r ϯ 108 2 kcal day or 4 51 kcal hr this equates to a cost of flight per hour of 54 1 kcal 226 4 kj and a cost of flight per km of 0 75 kcal 3 1 kj greenewalt 1975 estimated a cost of flight per km of 1 9 kcal 7 9 kj equivalent to a cost of flight per hour given 75 km hr flight velocity v of 136 4 kcal 570 7 kj differences between these two estimates may be attributable to the fact that greenewalt s 1975 estimate was based on european grebes podiceps spp loons gavia stellata and coots fulica atra we can calculate the total metabolic cost of migration cm according to 4 c i r i 24 v i 1 c d 5 c m c i the parenthetical term refers to the cost of basal metabolism depending on ta at each kilometer i in practice we use the mean temperature over the course of each kilometer for ta so that the units kcal km are the same for this term and cd by calculating the total energy required to move through each kilometer of migration we can compute the total energy cost of the migratory journey by summing all of the individual energy costs from each kilometer each ci chain of calculations connecting environmental temperature t to the cost of migration cm and the flight range d see specific equations for definitions a graphical depiction of the sequence of calculations connecting environmental temperature to the cost of migration is available in fig 3 2 3 2 flight cost and flight range to track the expected energy level of a migrant over the course of migration we use ci to estimate the rate of energy loss from a maximum energy level kjmax to a minimum energy level kjmin empirically derived values for these parameters yield a flight range d of 1280 2293 km following from 6 d k j m a x k j m i n c d these values are the middle of the range reported by whyte and bolen 1988 600 4300 km and seem to be a reasonable approximation of the distance moved by migrating waterfowl in a given jump irrespective of the effects of temperature lonsdorf et al 2016 flight range will decrease when migrants encounter temperatures below lct i e the cost of flight increases 2 3 3 refueling rate during stopover information regarding the refueling rate during stopovers is lacking lindström and kvist 1995 lindström 2003 though data on the maximum amount of forage material waterfowl can consume the proportion of time engaging in different behaviors at stopovers and pre migration jorde et al 1983 and the daily body mass increase over the course of migration hanson et al 1990 inform this parameter because migrants are not constantly feeding during migration estimates of refueling rate clearly represent a low estimate during active foraging periods and a high and even non applicable rate during non foraging periods like resting still these literature informed rates represents a starting point from which to condition our expectations by dividing the daily body mass increase bi by the time spent foraging per day ft we can compute a fuel acquisition rate fh in terms of kg per hour the product of this quotient and the estimated conversion of fat to energy e c 1 kg yields 39 700 kj rayner 1990 produces fh in terms of kj per hour 7 f h b i f t e c eq 7 represents the theoretical functional rate at which forage material can be consumed and made available as energy but it does not inform the frequency with which waterfowl are actively foraging we can estimate this foraging frequency using the telemetry derived stopover time values from krementz et al 2011 2012 to compute a continual effective fuel deposition rate per hour efh by dividing the difference in maximum and minimum fat energy stores in kj by the average time spent at a stopover st 8 e f h k j m a x k j m i n s t estimated fuel deposition rate represents the constant rate at which energy must be acquired for the duration of a stopover to increase an individual s energy level from the minimum state to the maximum state however waterfowl spend significant amounts of time at stopover sites not foraging and instead loafing on the lookout for predators or roosting we see evidence for this behavior in the calculated values of fh 71 1 kj hr and efh 29 9 kj hr an individual can afford to deposit fat reserves in pulses because the functional rate of food consumption greatly exceeds the rate of constant food consumption for the duration of a stopover event fig 4 2 3 4 change in energy level during migration to construct expectations for the progression of migration we need only apply eq 1 through 8 in series until the total maximum distance of migration is reached i e flight stopover flight stopover flight etc see fig 5 thus we use eq 5 to identify the temperature dependent distance dt at which energy levels first reach or fall below emin at which point birds cease flight and settle at a stopover we then invoke eqs 7 and 8 for refueling with a binomial probability of foraging success such that the number of hours out of s t the length of the stopover in hours that a bird forages h f is 9 h f b i n s t 1 f h e f h the migrant is held at the stopover until energy levels meet kjmax at which point the flight stage is recycled using the available empirical data on the physiological capabilities of waterfowl via telemetry and field observations we can create the generic expectations for energy level as a function of time during migration as seen in fig 6 the degree to which an individual seeks to minimize competition drives departure time fig 6a minimizing migration time moderating flight velocity influences energy loss over time during flights fig 5b and predator avoidance dictates the rate of energy gain at stopovers fig 6c by compiling these relationships sequentially we can derive the full migratory schedule in fig 6d this generic schedule represents expectations under current climatic conditions we can develop expectations for the effects of changing temperature on migratory schedules by changing the temperature regime based on climate change forecasts and comparing the result to this generic schedule fig 7 2 4 modeling migration across a landscape while the above formulations are valuable for investigating the interactions of temperature and metabolism over the course of migration they represent only a single possible trajectory and fail to capture potential parametric variability to evaluate migratory dynamics and their relation to temperature over a larger scale e g landscape we require extensions of these formulae to each of the other connections in our stylized migration variable network fig 1 we begin with the relation of temperature and body mass 2 4 1 temperature body mass and body fat temperature affects body fat content of migratory birds baldwin and kendeigh 1938 owen and cook 1977 witter and cuthill 1993 boos et al 2007 the general theory suggests birds may either regulate stored body fat in direct response to changes in ambient temperature or maintain a stable body fat content in relation to historical temperature trends with the optimal strategy depending on the degree of inter seasonal temperature variation and the predictability of that variation witter and cuthill 1993 a decades old yet robust quantification of the relationship between temperature and body mass suggests that body mass in terms of the percent of the fresh breeding season body mass varies linearly and inversely with temperature baldwin and kendeigh 1938 so for a bird with a breeding season body mass m of 1 14 kg body mass varies linearly with temperature t as 10 m 0 0042 t 1 1791 different breeding season body masses will require different slope and intercept terms for eq 10 this temperature body mass relation results in a ratio of minimum body mass to maximum body mass of 0 82 across a range of temperatures 5 to 25 c which is in keeping with the same metric for a great wealth of other bird species 0 8 0 9 folk et al 1966 this value for m feeds into eq 1 above there is substantial qualitative evidence indicating that body fat content increases with decreasing temperature baldwin and kendeigh 1938 nice 1938 king and farner 1966 helms 1968 blem and shelor 1986 dawson and marsh 1986 ekman and hake 1990 witter and cuthill 1993 but see kendeigh 1949 chaffee and mayhew 1964 o connor 1970 however there is no empirical data to our knowledge to inform an explicit connection between temperature and body fat content i e no equations therefore we rely on data indicating that typical ratios of body mass to body fat for mallards are in the low teens in terms of percentage body fat 13 of total fresh body mass representative of 10 5 12 6 from dabbert et al 1997 and 13 7 16 1 from boos et al 2007 this presupposes that increases in body fat coincide with increases in the mass of other body components e g muscle mass gonadal organs to maintain the 13 ratio this is a likely flawed assumption given the expectation for birds to deplete fat stores preferentially as a fuel source as they fly thus leading to a non constant fat non fat ratio but without a quantitative relationship to define this depletion we are left to invoke the simplifying assumption of a consistently proportional body fat content 2 4 2 metabolic rate and departure date when thermoregulatory costs exceed possible energetic inputs we would expect migration to commence i e individuals will leave breeding grounds when energy losses e o u t exceed energy gains e i n the time at which this occurs is the departure date and is defined as the date on which the ratio of energetic gains to losses first becomes negative for the majority of birds within the breeding region ecologically departure date likely aligns with other simultaneous and annually varying environmental processes mcnamara et al 1998 producing inconsistent timing across years drent et al 2003 arzel et al 2006 newton 2006 gordo 2007 krementz et al 2011 alves et al 2013 warren et al 2013 kölzsch et al 2014 la sorte et al 2014 for instance the primary reference point for spring migration timing is generally determined by photoperiod day of the year richardson 1978 jonzén et al 2006 2007 bulyuk 2012 and production of vegetative forage material or leaf out jonzén et al 2006 2007 van wijk et al 2012 si et al 2015 from this perspective individuals leaving on time in the spring are those that ride or overtake the green wave si et al 2015 those leaving before or after this period which lasts for several weeks can be thought of as early and late migrants respectively in autumn the reference point for migration timing is sub freezing temperatures and water closed by ice and snow thus inhibiting foraging therefore peak migration in autumn or on time departure can be thought of as the point at which the average daily temperature persists below 0 c for sufficient length of time to allow ice to form on open water to demonstrate the consequences of temperature differences on migration analytically we approximate the onset of migration for each season by drawing individuals from a distribution of possible migration start days we assume this distribution to be normally distributed about peak migration i e the mean of the distribution 0 with a standard deviation of 1 5 equivalent to 7 days allowing for a roughly two week window about peak migration during which individuals may depart fig 6a 2 4 3 body mass fat and flight power body mass dictates the power requirements for flight at various velocities derived via rayner 1990 and pennycuick et al 2013 estimates for the relation of body mass to flight power are highly dependent on taxa rayner 1990 provides mechanical power requirements of flying bats passerines non passerines and hummingbirds and a factor to convert mechanical power in watts to metabolic power kj per second s for non passerines rayner 1990 derives 11 p m r 44 54 m 0 682 0 207 m 0 249 where p m r is the power required to sustain flight at a velocity for maximum range which depends on a suite of factors see below in kj s 2 4 4 flight power and flight velocity the mechanical power requirements for flight relate to flight velocity as shown in the well known flight power curve as in fig 8 for our purposes we calculate the metabolic power requirements for flight and then convert this to mechanical power to calculate the velocity at which a bird of a certain mass will travel given its power we simply solve the equation defining the curve shown in fig 8 for power and use the known power requirements for velocity the equation defining the power curve is a function of body mass among other parameters such as wingspan wing area aspect ratio body drag coefficient etc and is specific to species we used the software program flight 1 25 see pennycuick et al 2013 to calculate the flight power curve for a 1 14 kg mallard with a body fat body mass fraction of 0 13 at an altitude of 0 m we rely on the default settings for all other parameters this results in a flight power curve for flight power and velocity defined as 12 p m r 0 0161 v m r 2 0 7638 v m r 23 462 there are three important reference velocities pmin emin and tmin fig 8 alerstam and lindström 1990 pmin is also referred to as vmp velocity for minimum power greenewalt 1975 pennycuick 1975 and constitutes the velocity at which the power required to remain aloft is at a minimum emin or vmr velocity of maximum range the velocity we use in eq 12 greenewalt 1975 pennycuick 1975 represents the velocity at which the energy required to fly a unit of distance is at a minimum emin is the most fuel efficient flight velocity and can be quantified by calculating the line passing through the origin and is tangential to the power velocity curve depicted in fig 8 emin is more fuel efficient than pmin even though it requires more power because it allows for greater velocity and therefore less flight time because energy is the product of power and time reducing time by increasing velocity can reduce energetic costs below those of pmin the final velocity tmin at which total flight time is minimized can be determined trigonometrically by calculating the tangent of the power velocity curve which passes through an intercept equal to the negative value of the rate at which fuel is gained on stopovers fig 8 see also alerstam and lindström 1990 tmin requires sufficiently more power than emin that it requires added energy costs despite the time savings over the course of migration pmin confers no energetic advantage and does not lead to shorter migration time and therefore may represent a physical constraint fig 8 see also pennycuick 1975 that is mass may limit a bird s ability to optimize flight velocity for time versus distance with larger birds being constrained to velocities closer to pmin and smaller birds being able to choose between emin and tmin pennycuick 1997 bruderer and boldt 2001 see also la sorte et al 2013 for population scale migration speed however even birds on the more massive end of the spectrum considered by bruderer and boldt 2001 like mallards showed appreciable flight velocity ranges in any event careful consideration must be made when basing expectations for optimal bird flight on theory as theoretical and observed flight velocities vary pennycuick 1997 pennycuick et al 2013 the vertex of the parabola defined by eq 12 and depicted in fig 8 defined along the y axis as pmin can be thought of as the body mass above which an increase in power results in an increase in speed and below which an increase in power results in a decrease in speed that is assuming an equal exertion of power more massive birds will fly at a slower speed than less massive birds this threshold body mass m t h r e s h o l d is calculable and equals 1 16 so as weight fluctuates over the course of the year birds with body mass above m t h r e s h o l d will fly at a lower velocity while exerting the same power as birds with body masses below m t h r e s h o l d demonstrated mathematically by rearranging eq 12 for v m r yielding two solutions 14 v m r 1 161 3 819 1 610 000 p m r 23 189 059 the function is when m m t h r e s h o l d and when m m t h r e s h o l d this results in a v m r in meters per second to convert to kilometers per hour we simply divide by 1000 1000 m e t e r s k i l o m e t e r and multiply the result by 3600 60 s e c o n d s m i n u t e 60 m i n u t e s h o u r 2 4 5 body mass fat flight velocity and flight range flight velocity and fat reserves together dictate the maximal range a migrant can travel much as one would when calculating the maximum distance for an automobile to travel knowing the target speed and the state of the fuel tank provides a reasonable expectation for total distance available ignoring aspects such as wind speed drag coefficient of the body in motion etc by multiplying the body mass by the expected proportion of the body mass composed of fat we obtain the expected fat reserves in kg multiplying expected fat reserves by the kilojoules to grams conversion of 39 700 kj per kg rayner 1990 comparable to 9 kilocalories per gram 4 184 kj per kcal 37 656 kj per kg from ricklefs 1974 yields the available fat reserves in terms of energy kj using the relations for the cost of flight per unit time and per unit distance from eqs 3 and 4 the equation for flight range fr is then 15 f r m ψ c t v m r using the body fat body mass proportion of 13 for ψ 2 4 6 temperature flight velocity flight range and stopover time the distance a bird flies the velocity with which it covers that distance and the thermal landscape with which it interacts all act in concert to dictate the length of time a migrant is likely to spend at a stopover stopovers are essential components of the migratory journey for many waterfowl lindström 1990 weber and houston 1997 hope et al 2011 providing opportunities to gain energy and increase fat stores depleted during flight although some individuals have been found to complete the journey in one non stop flight krementz et al 2011 2012 stopovers are also the points of greatest predation risk along the migration route particularly when individuals must make tradeoffs between foraging time and vigilance metcalfe and furness 1984 lima 1986 moore et al 1990 krapu and reinecke 1992 cimprich and moore 1999 schaub and jenni 2001 hope et al 2011 hagy et al 2014 total stopover time comprises the number of stops made during migration and the length of time spent at each stopover site under the same assumptions as we imposed for defining departure date that a bird will only move when faced with energetic deficiency a bird will remain at a stopover for as long as it is energetically beneficial to do so qualitatively this reduces to a strategy of staying ahead of the front of cold weather as shown in fig 9 to quantify this value stopover time s t we calculate the mean number of days for which energetic gains exceed energetic costs for every location in the autumn and spring migratory period windows the light gray shaded regions in fig 9 where locations are arbitrary nodes as in metabolic rate and departure date 16 s t d a y s e i n e o u t 2 4 7 landscape model of the full migratory process to extend the migration schedules and apply the formulations discussed above across a more representative landscape we simulated 41 temperature regimes across a large area 6 000 000 km2 and subsequently tested our network of interactions among the variables and dependencies of migration to evaluate their accuracy using empirical data we established a landscape of 6084 nodes 78 78 of dimension 32 19 32 19 km 20 mi 20 mi as in lonsdorf et al 2016 we defined the temperature across this landscape using the mean monthly temperature c of the northern and southern extents of the north american range of mallards as provided by natureserve range maps ridgley et al 2005 and then generated a linear sequence of temperatures from cold to warm to represent decreasing latitude across the landscape we repeated this process temporally generating sequences of temperatures to establish daily records across the landscape for the entire year starting with the end of the breeding period july 1 and running through the following breeding period june 30th of the subsequent calendar year temperature data were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric association s national centers for environmental prediction noaa ncep kalnay et al 1996 to generate multiple temperature regimes to mimic a warming climate we varied the mean monthly temperatures used as input from 2 c to 2 c by increments of 0 1 c therefore a temperature regime of 0 c means that the mean temperature across the landscape is 0 c different than present day northern hemispheric mean temperatures we then converted this thermal landscape to an energetic landscape using the temperature metabolism relation eqs 3 and 4 this created a grid of nodes each defined by the temperature dependent metabolic cost of existence this metabolic cost of existence grid was subtracted from a similar grid of identical dimension representing maximum potential energy gain per node based on the 1 8 bmr basal metabolic rate daily rate of gain to create a final grid that informed the temperature dependent daily rate of energy flux as described in our assumptions above this grid represents the daily temperature dependent energetic landscape defining the net energetic flux a bird would experience in any node at any day during the migration period it is to this landscape that we applied the equations and formulae detailed above we then iterate the process across the suite of mean temperature shifts 2 c to 2 c to identify the effects of varying temperature on the factors of migration this simulation was carried out using r v 3 3 1 r core team 2016 and the code is available as a separate file in the supporting information 3 results 3 1 modeling migration across a landscape results of this simulation were consistent with expectations see fig 10 for graphical display of results the average date of departure or the onset of the non breeding period of the annual cycle ranged from november 11 under the coldest conditions to november 30 under the warmest in their telemetry based study of mallard migration in the mississippi flyway krementz et al 2012 found an average date of departure for their tracked mallards of october 23 with a range from september 17 to december 7 the earlier date of departure observed by krementz et al 2012 may be due to the effects of temperature not on bird physiology per se but rather decreasing seasonal availability of forage a factor we assumed was constant and plentiful mean fat deposits across the temperatures applied ranged from 5927 kj under colder than current conditions to 6014 kj under warmer conditions a difference of 2 this result is in line with the estimated maximum available energy reported by whyte and bolen 1988 and dabbert et al 1997 of 5000 9000 kj as well as that of 6025 kj used in lonsdorf et al 2016 mean flight velocity ranged from 75 44 to 78 05 km hr as the average temperature increased comparable to the estimates from pennycuick et al 2013 70 92 s d 5 58 km hr bruderer and boldt 2001 77 04 s d 8 64 km hr and bellrose and crompton 1981 71 8 s d 11 1 km hr for mallards mean flight ranges extended from 1257 km to 1394 km colder to warmer in excellent agreement with what has been observed for both spring migration 1200 km range 443 2170 km krementz et al 2011 and autumn migration 1400 km range 143 2947 km krementz et al 2012 we note however that both of these figures are from studies initiating in arkansas and ending in the prairie potholes region of the mississippi flyway our landscape considers the equivalent of migration from the hudson bay to the gulf of mexico thus allowing for greater possible distances than krementz et al 2011 2012 could observe average stopover time ranged from 16 7 to 24 7 days cold to warm during spring migration and 11 9 19 0 days cold to warm during autumn migration both of these estimates are reasonable approximations of observations from krementz et al 2011 12 0 9 days for spring and krementz et al 2012 15 4 1 47 days for autumn the shorter observed than predicted stopover time in spring may be attributable to our exclusion of other factors of migration for example spring birds will be migrating following a less energetically demanding period of the annual cycle and thus may begin migration in better body condition than we assumed alternatively birds following leaf out in the spring may refuel more quickly than they can in the fall as a result of increased forage availability our simulation does not include either of these features suggesting that the primary mechanism driving migration in autumn is indeed temperature hence the recovery of accurate stopover times for this period while in the spring there are other factors causing a departure from expected stopover time hence our overestimate 3 2 cessation of migration it is possible that mallards and other dabbling ducks could cease migration given warm enough temperatures we can show this possibility by allowing the average temperature across the simulated landscape to increase above the arbitrarily imposed 2 c limit our simulation considering only the effects of temperature yielded thermal landscapes in which energetic gains exceeded energetic losses in the southern range of current mallard breeding habitat i e above roughly the 49th latitudinal parallel with an average increase in temperature across the landscape of 7 6 c for individuals breeding further south in the southern reaches of the prairie potholes region i e at approximately the 43rd latitudinal parallel migration is expected to cease after a temperature increase of 4 5 c within the range of predicted global surface temperature increase by 2100 ipcc 2014 considering a host of other factors influencing migration patterns and their relation to climate change for instance potential range shifts as the climate warms monahan and hijmans 2008 our estimate for the cessation of migration may even serve as a late estimate i e the confluence of factors affecting migration may lead to mallard populations forgoing seasonal dispersal even sooner than 2100 4 discussion throughout the latter half of the 20th century a great deal of effort was invested in elucidating the physical abilities and physiological constraints of birds particularly waterfowl these efforts have helped pull back the curtain on migration patterns and dynamics and paved the way for increasing interest in quantifying and predicting these patterns and dynamics concurrently climate change has been sufficiently well documented and its potential consequences clearly demonstrated that we can incorporate expectations of a warming climate into our efforts at understanding migration by bridging the gap between these two arenas of migration and climate we have developed testable hypotheses including the expectation of a warming climate lessening energetic demands in more northern latitudes leading to the possibility of more birds opting for more frequent stopovers closer to the breeding grounds during their journey 4 1 expectations for waterfowl migration because temperature interacts with metabolic demands and energetics in a predictable way we can create expected migration schedules using physiological and climatic data under the assumptions of a changing climate these schedules can be expanded by considering the effects of temperature on each of the other down stream variables of migration as well e g body mass flight velocity etc which can be incorporated into continent scale energetics models of avian migration results of our simulation suggest that we may witness a cessation of migration within 80 years for mallards and similar dabbling duck species as a warmer climate leads to more tolerable thermal conditions allowing birds to remain in their breeding grounds over winter the reasons for an expected cessation of migration relate primarily to the direct effects of temperature on migration as the average simulated temperature increases we found waterfowl were expected to experience temperatures below their lct less frequently i e fewer occurrences of 20 c temperatures this reduction in days facing temperature 20 c should result in a metabolic reprieve for migrants allowing migrants to operate metabolic rates within their tnz and allocate more energy to flight or foraging with more energy available the risk of starvation could decrease natural selection then should favor a migration strategy minimizing predation risk flight time and competition by selecting for flight velocities as near to tmin as possible fewer stopovers but of longer duration and later departure minimizing predation risk while flying at tmin is contradictory as optimal fat load for predation minimization is less than optimal fat load for migration speed maximization alerstam and lindström 1990 consequently some sacrifice in speed must be made to minimize predation risk thus natural selection should act such that this sacrifice will be as small as possible under these circumstances near tmin flight velocity fewer longer stopovers later departure the generic migration schedule fig 5d would be expected to shift fig 6 ultimately there may eventually be no autumn departure at all because from an energetics standpoint the early on time late tradeoff is a threshold proportion of the energy required to maintain the basal metabolic rate bmr and the energy available to the bird if sufficient energy in the form of forage material is available to the bird to maintain its bmr it may depart later or forgo migration altogether if temperatures continue to rise at currently expected rates however migrants could decades hence incur the cost of operating a high metabolic rate to cool themselves down and prevent overheating that is they may encounter temperatures exceeding the critical temperature threshold in the future more often than they currently do as more energy is used for metabolic functions fuel deposition rates will decrease i e there will be more time spent foraging as a greater proportion of acquired food is used to account for this increase in energetic demands therefore the pendulum may ultimately reverse direction and favor an optimal migration strategy optimizing energy use again or compelling a range shift to cooler conditions in the north we stress that the finding related to migration cessation is preliminary and subject to considerable influence by factors not considered here for instance we ignored the impact of wind velocity and direction an important driver of migration further we imposed a spatially uniform temperature regime on the environment that is inconsistent with known warming patterns wherein more northerly latitudes increase in temperature more quickly we made these simplifying assumptions for the sake of clarity and to identify solely the effects of temperature on migration we emphasize the importance of exploring these other considerations in future investigations 4 2 comments about framework 4 2 1 indirect effects and feedback interactions among the factors of migration depicted in fig 1 represent the most critically important associations for a rigorous modeling approach but they are not an exhaustive catalog for instance the time when a bird initiates migration will surely have an effect on flight velocity flying faster to make up for a late start for instance and if a bird has a sufficient body mass given the thermal landscape with which it interacts it may complete the migratory journey in a single flight obviating stopovers entirely many of these auxiliary interactions are either functionally subsumed in the associations we do consider or are not relevant to the investigation at hand however there are three indirect or feedback effects that we expand upon here shown as gray dotted lines in fig 1 as they have particular relevance to our efforts and warrant explicit discussion first we detailed the connection between body mass and metabolic rate in the context of temperature dependency but there are also effects of metabolic rate on body mass as a migrant travels it expends energy i e burns body fat and therefore decreases its total body mass while this instantaneous change in the association of metabolic rate and body mass may have observable effects on the timing and outcome of migratory stages it would require a finer spatial and temporal resolution from the input data than is often practicable we therefore ignored this connection in our example simulation however if the data were available potentially through telemetry based studies then this body mass energy interaction might be worth elucidating to evaluate the degree to which it improves the accuracy of theoretical expectations second and similarly flight velocity influences metabolic rate in a generally linear and positive fashion i e faster flight higher metabolic rate again however the resolution of available data is not likely to allow for such instantaneous relationships to be demonstrated additionally the range of velocities at which birds are expected to fly across a sample of temperature regimes is relatively small see below and therefore this fine scale interaction may not be informative finally we anticipate stopover time having indirect effects on body mass by influencing the amount of time spent actively foraging the increase in total body fat and the amount of energy exerted to maintain basal metabolic requirements for the duration of the stopover event our framework focuses exclusively on the thermal landscape and ignores the amount of potentially available foraging material we assume there is more food available than can be consumed future efforts aimed at identifying this connection forage availability across the landscape and decay throughout the non breeding period are on going however 4 2 2 model assumptions our goal was to evaluate exclusively the effect of temperature on the variables of migration so we made several simplifying assumptions to guide our efforts we assumed migrants should maintain optimal sub maximal fat reserves during migration to increase fuel efficiency hedenström 1992 witter and cuthill 1993 klaassen 1996 and assumed a constant level of energy increase following lindström and kvist 1995 and kvist and lindström 2003 lindström and kvist 1995 suggested a daily rate of gain equivalent to 4 6 bmr basal metabolic rate for passerines and kvist and lindström 2003 found that a scaling factor of 3 10 bmr was reasonable for some european species of wading birds the most parsimonious value for our situation was 1 8 bmr the difference between the value used here and those used by lindström and kvist 1995 and kvist and lindström 2003 is attributable to differences in body mass of target organisms larger bodied birds require fewer multiples of bmr this value is consistent with a strategy which 1 optimizes stopover time during migration by stopping often enough to maintain sufficient energy reserves for flight detours if inclement weather should arise richardson 1978 klaassen 1996 pennycuick 1997 newton 2006 and 2 favors foraging without regard for exposure risk at stopovers lindström and kvist 1995 piersma 2002 guillemain et al 2004 alves et al 2013 this approach minimizes the risk of starvation by maintaining energy reserves above dangerously low levels and avoids excessive time spent at stopover sites by gaining energy back refueling as quickly as possible this refueling rate may not be the same as constant foraging however as there is an increased energy cost associated with constant foraging activity therefore refueling as quickly as possible means refueling faster than an individual would if it remained vigilant of predators but slower than non stop foraging in sum we expected energetically optimal migration to favor on time departure flight velocity near emin optimal stopover number and refueling rate and below maximum fat reserves we assumed a 365 day calendar year ignoring years with a leap day second the procedure for defining the thermal landscape assumed a constant temperature across longitudes see animation in supporting information furthermore we assumed breeding and wintering ground ranges did not shift as the mean temperature across the landscape changed and we expected individuals will depart on time relative to leaf out in the spring and iced over waterways in the autumn jonzén et al 2006 2007 van wijk et al 2012 si et al 2015 this approach maximized the available food for migrants and facilitated more energy efficient foraging activity and reduced to a selection for departure when energy outputs exceed inputs we also ignored the effects of hunting and predation and assumed sufficient forage next we assumed individuals are most likely to fly nearest to emin vmr to maintain fuel efficient locomotion greenewalt 1975 pennycuick 1975 alerstam and lindström 1990 allowing each of these assumptions to vary across their observed range of variation should lead to a much wider migration profile than our model suggested 4 2 3 additional areas of uncertainty the major elements depicted in fig 1 are expected to vary stochastically but some parameters are likely under greater physiological control than others for instance we can expect that the power of a bird in flight would vary relatively little in comparison to the initial body mass distribution of birds readying for migration especially as birds in some years and locations may face a drought or surfeit of forage spatial and temporal variation in forage availability would influence stopover length as well thus those aspects of migration undergoing the greatest stochastic variability are those to which species are most likely to respond behaviorally whereas those under physiological control are least variable 4 3 generalization of model while the framework laid out here and the corresponding code is easily modified to generalize this model to other avian species there is a great deal of work required in reviewing the literature for necessary parameters or for some species to conduct the necessary experimental investigations to identify unknown parameters the pertinent variables are presented in table 1 along with the sources for their parameterization for mallards some of these values will be easily obtainable for many species e g body mass flight velocity while others are likely to prove elusive e g foraging time metabolic rate variables in the absence of species specific parameter values the values for closely related species may need to be relied upon for others allometry may prove insightful e g nagy 1987 mckechnie and wolf 2004 increased experimental and literature review efforts aimed at elucidating these values for model organisms from other genera would broaden the applicability of our approach the mallard like ducks we focused our model on were initially treated as simple bags of calories acquiring and expending energy in the course of movement the approach of building energy based movement models from first principles by explicating the expenditure and acquisition of calories understanding which parameters of migration are physiologically versus behaviorally constrained could prove fruitful to those wishing to develop similar models for non avian taxa 5 conclusions given their large spatial distributions migratory nature and reliance on increasingly fragmented and isolated habitats between wintering and breeding grounds birds in general and waterfowl in particular are of special interest to conservation and management efforts bateman et al 2016 gorzo et al 2016 lebrun et al 2016 evidence of declines among populations of these species is evidence of trouble across space and time identifying those species and catching them at the right times is difficult stanton et al 2016 because of the multiple spatial and temporal scales at which migration operates therefore we require methods for predicting patterns of migration at various scales by integrating local level monitoring programs and the data they produce e g aagaard et al 2015 with large scale modeling techniques lonsdorf et al 2016 we can meet this need the true utility of such models however is fully realized only when we can adequately describe past and current observed patterns and predict how these patterns will change in the future we aim to make use of the accelerating growth of evidence of global climate change and the copious body of literature pertaining to waterfowl physiology to extend a modeling framework currently implemented to explain waterfowl migration patterns in north america lonsdorf et al 2016 by focused our efforts on the role of temperature in the energetic gains and losses of migrating waterfowl we can begin to develop expectations for how patterns will shift and how when migration may cease in a warmer climate acknowledgements this work was

25296,climate and weather affect avian migration by influencing when and where birds fly the energy costs and risks of flight and the ability to sense cues necessary for proper navigation we review the literature of the physiology of avian migration and the influence of climate specifically temperature on avian migration dynamics we use waterfowl as a model guild because of the ready availability of empirical physiological data and their enormous economic value but our discussion and expectations are broadly generalizable to migratory birds in general we detail potential consequences of an increasingly warm climate on avian migration including the possibility of the cessation of migration by some populations and species our intent is to lay the groundwork for including temperature effects on energetic gains and losses of migratory birds with the expected consequences of increasing temperatures into a predictive modeling framework to this end we provide a

berchtold et al 2017 climate change is threatening migratory birds in profound and myriad ways e g walther et al 2002 drent et al 2003 jenni and kéry 2003 both et al 2004 2006 2010 wilcove and wikelski 2008 national wildlife federation 2013 national audubon society 2014 berchtold et al 2017 in terms of migration dynamics a strong case can be made for temperature being the most influential of climate change related environmental factors smith and prince 1973 klaassen 1996 piersma 2002 gordo 2007 swanson 2010 metabolic rate is closely tied to temperature dictating whether an organism can operate at its lowest metabolic rate in its thermal neutral zone or if it must expend energy to either cool down sweat pant increase blood flow to extremities or heat up shiver burn fat constrict blood flow food availability and its subsequent utility as energy will dictate the success of a migrant in reaching its goal temperature influences energy availability through plant phenology gordo and sanz 2006 knudsen et al 2011 teitelbaum et al 2015 precipitation and wind currents are also altered by temperature other potentially important factors like photoperiod or genetics which have strong influences on the timing of migration departure are inert relative to climate change and therefore of little interest in terms of forecasting changes brought about by a changing climate thus focusing on the role temperature plays in shaping avian migration patterns and how those patterns might be expected to change as temperature generally increases is clearly a valuable endeavor we note that each of these other considerations is worthy of its own dedicated investigation but we exclude them from further consideration here in terms of the behavioral responses to changing temperatures recent studies have shown an increased tendency for sedentary behavior given sufficient feeding throughout the winter as temperatures in breeding grounds remain sufficiently warm wilcove and wikelski 2008 visser et al 2009 knudsen et al 2011 robinson et al 2016 berchtold et al 2017 indeed the occurrence of partially migratory species and populations is well founded barta et al 2008 and it is reasonable to believe that in a warmer climate it may be evolutionarily advantageous to stay in place rather than suffer the reduced survivorship of a migratory journey wilcove and wikelski 2008 visser et al 2009 berchtold et al 2017 species that seem to have an immutable instinct to migrate regardless of the temperature at their breeding grounds are also highly susceptible to the repercussions of a changing climate walther et al 2002 sanz aguilar et al 2012 while migration still takes place in these species the routes they take and dynamics they display along the way are being modified as the atmosphere warms and the timing of these migration events is changing as well largely occurring earlier in the spring and later in the fall to match the shifting patterns of plant growth and production jonzén et al 2006 2007 gordo 2007 si et al 2015 however there are reproductive obstacles that appear to represent fixed deadlines for when breeding can occur so even though migration timing shifts to match the phenology of forage when birds reach their breeding grounds they are still faced with the challenge of trying to produce offspring within a prescribed window of time both and visser 2001 both et al 2004 2010 arzel et al 2006 si et al 2015 additionally for some species a breeding season extended by warmer temperatures is prompting some individuals to produce extra clutches gordo 2007 knudsen et al 2011 putting pressure on parents to fledge that final clutch faster so as to depart for the return trip before intolerable conditions set in in this paper we review the literature related to the energetics of migration and the interaction of migration and temperature we seek to explicate the effects of temperature on energetic gains and losses during migration with an eye toward accounting for warmer atmospheric temperatures our aim is to connect the extensive literature of physiological investigations into the dynamics of bird metabolism with the rich and rapidly expanding literature of avian migration the litany of species participating in annual migratory cycles includes a wide range of associated habitat types and ecosystems e g passerine forest birds and grassland birds coastal shorebirds and pelagic seabirds wetland waterfowl and birds of prey while all of these taxa and landscapes require conservation and management attention we focus on waterfowl and the wetlands they use we stress that while we parameterize the model we develop for waterfowl it is readily generalizable for migratory birds in general given the availability of requisite data waterfowl are a heavily managed group national wildlife federation 2013 national audubon society 2014 and have been equally heavily studied in terms of their physiology and flight dynamics pennycuick 1975 whyte and bolen 1988 lindström and kvist 1995 van wijk et al 2012 thorup et al 2014 thus we use waterfowl as a model to form our specific expectations for the effects of temperature on energetic dynamics but these expectations are conceptually applicable to avian migration in general we leverage the available literature to explore the selective forces acting on migrants via the suite of available migratory strategies we introduce a simulation modeling framework to evaluate the effects of climate change especially varying temperature on the energetic gains and losses of migrants during their migratory journeys giving particular attention to the connections between temperature metabolism and migration finally we elaborate on the factors of selection acting on each strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 thermal energetics of migration in a classic review alerstam and lindström 1990 consider the consequences of what they call the selective forces of avian migration time energy and predation a fourth selective force fitting neatly in this group is competition each of these forces is sensitive to changes in temperature some more directly than others see fig 1 for instance temperature affects migration directly by modifying metabolic requirements smith and prince 1973 klaassen 1996 piersma 2002 swanson 2010 and body mass in terms of fat load witter and cuthill 1993 and see citations therein establishing the connection between increasing fat reserves with decreasing temperatures a successful or optimal as in alerstam and lindström 1990 migratory strategy minimizes or optimizes the selective forces of migration as much as possible the magnitude of influence of the selective forces of migration can be modified according to behaviorally influenced variables departure date flight velocity stopover time and fat reserves the main energy source for flight i e fuel level each of these variables can be thought of on a spectrum early to late departure slow to fast flight velocity short to long stopover time lean to ample fat reserves along which individuals in the population are distributed pennycuick 1975 alerstam and lindström 1990 hedenström 1992 bruderer and boldt 2001 drent et al 2003 pennycuick and battley 2003 la sorte et al 2013 pennycuick et al 2013 selection acts to craft migration strategies by occupying points on each of these spectra and the overall strategies correspond to an optimization scheme of the selective forces which selective forces are minimized in a given strategy is a function of the intensity of selection on each variable in general time minimization is considered the strongest selective force over the course of migration alerstam and lindström 1990 weber and houston 1997 optimal migration however requires several smaller scale minimization optimization strategies operating at the level of flight jumps and stopovers rather than over the entire migration journey considering all of these small scale strategies it becomes clear that time minimization is not globally optimal in all contexts weber et al 1998 additionally tradeoffs between the behavioral variables associated with migration are inter related and deal with various combinations of the components of migratory flight but mainly concern whether to conserve energy or accept higher risks as such we will consider the consequences of minimizing time predation risk or competitive effects relative to the increased energetic costs accompanying each of the smaller scale strategies here 2 2 considering uncertainty in parameter estimates we modelled the temperature related energetics of migration deterministically informing estimates for relevant parameters using literature derived values and substituting missing information with empirical formulae where necessary we emphasize that this effort is ab initio or a first principles effort in developing an energetics based migration model so future work exploring parametric uncertainty environmental stochasticity and model sensitivity would be a natural progression to this study this eventual elaboration is especially important given the myriad sources of unpredictability for the birds themselves e g extreme weather events variable predation and hunter harvest using this energetic based model as a testbed though we can begin to explore in a systematic fashion the differential effects of uncertainty and variation in migration after explicating the model we briefly review important aspects of model uncertainty worthy of initial follow up investigation 2 3 modeling a single migration trajectory 2 3 1 temperature and metabolism many investigations into the dynamics of the metabolic curve for waterfowl have been performed lasiewski and dawson 1967 hartung 1967 zar 1968 smith and prince 1973 miller 1984 daan et al 1990 klaassen 1996 and we can leverage these data to inform relatively simple algebraic relations of metabolism temperature and flight ultimately generating theoretical migration schedules sensu drent et al 2003 by manipulating temperature in these simulated schedules we create expectations for the effects of changing temperature on migration strategies we therefore begin this section with a brief overview of the quantitative connection between temperature and metabolism and its ramifications on the cost of flight and migration schedules for each equation presented we provide the definitions of variables and values in table 1 used to parameterize the subsequent simulation for a mallard anas platyrhynchos like dabbling duck metabolically there are two segments of thermal influence one occurring above and the other below species specific temperature limits the upper uct and lower lct critical temperatures respectively above approximately 20 c with a range of 18 25 c jorde et al 1984 prince 1979 smith and prince 1973 most waterfowl exhibit an equilibrium metabolic rate r that is heat production is balanced by heat lost to the environment this is the thermal neutral zone tnz in fig 2 within the tnz metabolic rate is insensitive to changes in ta and is tightly correlated with body mass following the well known 3 4ths power law convention the general equation to quantify the contribution of temperature to metabolic rate is 1 r α β t a σ m λ γ t a t a l c t l c t t a u c t t a u c t where r is the temperature dependent whether above or below lct metabolic rate α and β represent the intercept and slope below the tnz respectively and γ represents the slope above the tnz ta is ambient temperature in c and m is body mass temperatures exceeding the upper critical temperature are most likely to be encountered during breeding rather than in migration therefore we dispense with further discussion of this aspect and focus instead on the lower temperatures encouraging movement along a temperature gradient that is more conducive to maintaining the thermal neutral zone while all of the literature derived estimates for σ and λ are roughly similar see table 1 and references therein the values from heitmeyer 2010 represents the most rigorous of the estimates and are likely to be the most accurate see miller and eadie 2006 we use heitmeyer s 2010 estimate of r in the tnz with prince s 1979 approach below the lct as this is a reasonable representation of the relationship between temperature and metabolic rate other representations are however possible e g mckinney and mcwilliams 2005 metabolism and flight cost experimentally determined estimates for the cost of flight per unit time ct have been available for decades and are often conceived of as simple multiples of metabolic rate prince 1979 whyte and bolen 1988 castro and myers 1988 the common correlation is 2 c t a r where a is a generic coefficient cost of flight per unit time can be converted to the cost of flight per unit distance cd productive energy in fig 2 via 3 c d c t v given 75 km hr flight velocity v and assuming ambient temperatures above lct i e using r ϯ 108 2 kcal day or 4 51 kcal hr this equates to a cost of flight per hour of 54 1 kcal 226 4 kj and a cost of flight per km of 0 75 kcal 3 1 kj greenewalt 1975 estimated a cost of flight per km of 1 9 kcal 7 9 kj equivalent to a cost of flight per hour given 75 km hr flight velocity v of 136 4 kcal 570 7 kj differences between these two estimates may be attributable to the fact that greenewalt s 1975 estimate was based on european grebes podiceps spp loons gavia stellata and coots fulica atra we can calculate the total metabolic cost of migration cm according to 4 c i r i 24 v i 1 c d 5 c m c i the parenthetical term refers to the cost of basal metabolism depending on ta at each kilometer i in practice we use the mean temperature over the course of each kilometer for ta so that the units kcal km are the same for this term and cd by calculating the total energy required to move through each kilometer of migration we can compute the total energy cost of the migratory journey by summing all of the individual energy costs from each kilometer each ci chain of calculations connecting environmental temperature t to the cost of migration cm and the flight range d see specific equations for definitions a graphical depiction of the sequence of calculations connecting environmental temperature to the cost of migration is available in fig 3 2 3 2 flight cost and flight range to track the expected energy level of a migrant over the course of migration we use ci to estimate the rate of energy loss from a maximum energy level kjmax to a minimum energy level kjmin empirically derived values for these parameters yield a flight range d of 1280 2293 km following from 6 d k j m a x k j m i n c d these values are the middle of the range reported by whyte and bolen 1988 600 4300 km and seem to be a reasonable approximation of the distance moved by migrating waterfowl in a given jump irrespective of the effects of temperature lonsdorf et al 2016 flight range will decrease when migrants encounter temperatures below lct i e the cost of flight increases 2 3 3 refueling rate during stopover information regarding the refueling rate during stopovers is lacking lindström and kvist 1995 lindström 2003 though data on the maximum amount of forage material waterfowl can consume the proportion of time engaging in different behaviors at stopovers and pre migration jorde et al 1983 and the daily body mass increase over the course of migration hanson et al 1990 inform this parameter because migrants are not constantly feeding during migration estimates of refueling rate clearly represent a low estimate during active foraging periods and a high and even non applicable rate during non foraging periods like resting still these literature informed rates represents a starting point from which to condition our expectations by dividing the daily body mass increase bi by the time spent foraging per day ft we can compute a fuel acquisition rate fh in terms of kg per hour the product of this quotient and the estimated conversion of fat to energy e c 1 kg yields 39 700 kj rayner 1990 produces fh in terms of kj per hour 7 f h b i f t e c eq 7 represents the theoretical functional rate at which forage material can be consumed and made available as energy but it does not inform the frequency with which waterfowl are actively foraging we can estimate this foraging frequency using the telemetry derived stopover time values from krementz et al 2011 2012 to compute a continual effective fuel deposition rate per hour efh by dividing the difference in maximum and minimum fat energy stores in kj by the average time spent at a stopover st 8 e f h k j m a x k j m i n s t estimated fuel deposition rate represents the constant rate at which energy must be acquired for the duration of a stopover to increase an individual s energy level from the minimum state to the maximum state however waterfowl spend significant amounts of time at stopover sites not foraging and instead loafing on the lookout for predators or roosting we see evidence for this behavior in the calculated values of fh 71 1 kj hr and efh 29 9 kj hr an individual can afford to deposit fat reserves in pulses because the functional rate of food consumption greatly exceeds the rate of constant food consumption for the duration of a stopover event fig 4 2 3 4 change in energy level during migration to construct expectations for the progression of migration we need only apply eq 1 through 8 in series until the total maximum distance of migration is reached i e flight stopover flight stopover flight etc see fig 5 thus we use eq 5 to identify the temperature dependent distance dt at which energy levels first reach or fall below emin at which point birds cease flight and settle at a stopover we then invoke eqs 7 and 8 for refueling with a binomial probability of foraging success such that the number of hours out of s t the length of the stopover in hours that a bird forages h f is 9 h f b i n s t 1 f h e f h the migrant is held at the stopover until energy levels meet kjmax at which point the flight stage is recycled using the available empirical data on the physiological capabilities of waterfowl via telemetry and field observations we can create the generic expectations for energy level as a function of time during migration as seen in fig 6 the degree to which an individual seeks to minimize competition drives departure time fig 6a minimizing migration time moderating flight velocity influences energy loss over time during flights fig 5b and predator avoidance dictates the rate of energy gain at stopovers fig 6c by compiling these relationships sequentially we can derive the full migratory schedule in fig 6d this generic schedule represents expectations under current climatic conditions we can develop expectations for the effects of changing temperature on migratory schedules by changing the temperature regime based on climate change forecasts and comparing the result to this generic schedule fig 7 2 4 modeling migration across a landscape while the above formulations are valuable for investigating the interactions of temperature and metabolism over the course of migration they represent only a single possible trajectory and fail to capture potential parametric variability to evaluate migratory dynamics and their relation to temperature over a larger scale e g landscape we require extensions of these formulae to each of the other connections in our stylized migration variable network fig 1 we begin with the relation of temperature and body mass 2 4 1 temperature body mass and body fat temperature affects body fat content of migratory birds baldwin and kendeigh 1938 owen and cook 1977 witter and cuthill 1993 boos et al 2007 the general theory suggests birds may either regulate stored body fat in direct response to changes in ambient temperature or maintain a stable body fat content in relation to historical temperature trends with the optimal strategy depending on the degree of inter seasonal temperature variation and the predictability of that variation witter and cuthill 1993 a decades old yet robust quantification of the relationship between temperature and body mass suggests that body mass in terms of the percent of the fresh breeding season body mass varies linearly and inversely with temperature baldwin and kendeigh 1938 so for a bird with a breeding season body mass m of 1 14 kg body mass varies linearly with temperature t as 10 m 0 0042 t 1 1791 different breeding season body masses will require different slope and intercept terms for eq 10 this temperature body mass relation results in a ratio of minimum body mass to maximum body mass of 0 82 across a range of temperatures 5 to 25 c which is in keeping with the same metric for a great wealth of other bird species 0 8 0 9 folk et al 1966 this value for m feeds into eq 1 above there is substantial qualitative evidence indicating that body fat content increases with decreasing temperature baldwin and kendeigh 1938 nice 1938 king and farner 1966 helms 1968 blem and shelor 1986 dawson and marsh 1986 ekman and hake 1990 witter and cuthill 1993 but see kendeigh 1949 chaffee and mayhew 1964 o connor 1970 however there is no empirical data to our knowledge to inform an explicit connection between temperature and body fat content i e no equations therefore we rely on data indicating that typical ratios of body mass to body fat for mallards are in the low teens in terms of percentage body fat 13 of total fresh body mass representative of 10 5 12 6 from dabbert et al 1997 and 13 7 16 1 from boos et al 2007 this presupposes that increases in body fat coincide with increases in the mass of other body components e g muscle mass gonadal organs to maintain the 13 ratio this is a likely flawed assumption given the expectation for birds to deplete fat stores preferentially as a fuel source as they fly thus leading to a non constant fat non fat ratio but without a quantitative relationship to define this depletion we are left to invoke the simplifying assumption of a consistently proportional body fat content 2 4 2 metabolic rate and departure date when thermoregulatory costs exceed possible energetic inputs we would expect migration to commence i e individuals will leave breeding grounds when energy losses e o u t exceed energy gains e i n the time at which this occurs is the departure date and is defined as the date on which the ratio of energetic gains to losses first becomes negative for the majority of birds within the breeding region ecologically departure date likely aligns with other simultaneous and annually varying environmental processes mcnamara et al 1998 producing inconsistent timing across years drent et al 2003 arzel et al 2006 newton 2006 gordo 2007 krementz et al 2011 alves et al 2013 warren et al 2013 kölzsch et al 2014 la sorte et al 2014 for instance the primary reference point for spring migration timing is generally determined by photoperiod day of the year richardson 1978 jonzén et al 2006 2007 bulyuk 2012 and production of vegetative forage material or leaf out jonzén et al 2006 2007 van wijk et al 2012 si et al 2015 from this perspective individuals leaving on time in the spring are those that ride or overtake the green wave si et al 2015 those leaving before or after this period which lasts for several weeks can be thought of as early and late migrants respectively in autumn the reference point for migration timing is sub freezing temperatures and water closed by ice and snow thus inhibiting foraging therefore peak migration in autumn or on time departure can be thought of as the point at which the average daily temperature persists below 0 c for sufficient length of time to allow ice to form on open water to demonstrate the consequences of temperature differences on migration analytically we approximate the onset of migration for each season by drawing individuals from a distribution of possible migration start days we assume this distribution to be normally distributed about peak migration i e the mean of the distribution 0 with a standard deviation of 1 5 equivalent to 7 days allowing for a roughly two week window about peak migration during which individuals may depart fig 6a 2 4 3 body mass fat and flight power body mass dictates the power requirements for flight at various velocities derived via rayner 1990 and pennycuick et al 2013 estimates for the relation of body mass to flight power are highly dependent on taxa rayner 1990 provides mechanical power requirements of flying bats passerines non passerines and hummingbirds and a factor to convert mechanical power in watts to metabolic power kj per second s for non passerines rayner 1990 derives 11 p m r 44 54 m 0 682 0 207 m 0 249 where p m r is the power required to sustain flight at a velocity for maximum range which depends on a suite of factors see below in kj s 2 4 4 flight power and flight velocity the mechanical power requirements for flight relate to flight velocity as shown in the well known flight power curve as in fig 8 for our purposes we calculate the metabolic power requirements for flight and then convert this to mechanical power to calculate the velocity at which a bird of a certain mass will travel given its power we simply solve the equation defining the curve shown in fig 8 for power and use the known power requirements for velocity the equation defining the power curve is a function of body mass among other parameters such as wingspan wing area aspect ratio body drag coefficient etc and is specific to species we used the software program flight 1 25 see pennycuick et al 2013 to calculate the flight power curve for a 1 14 kg mallard with a body fat body mass fraction of 0 13 at an altitude of 0 m we rely on the default settings for all other parameters this results in a flight power curve for flight power and velocity defined as 12 p m r 0 0161 v m r 2 0 7638 v m r 23 462 there are three important reference velocities pmin emin and tmin fig 8 alerstam and lindström 1990 pmin is also referred to as vmp velocity for minimum power greenewalt 1975 pennycuick 1975 and constitutes the velocity at which the power required to remain aloft is at a minimum emin or vmr velocity of maximum range the velocity we use in eq 12 greenewalt 1975 pennycuick 1975 represents the velocity at which the energy required to fly a unit of distance is at a minimum emin is the most fuel efficient flight velocity and can be quantified by calculating the line passing through the origin and is tangential to the power velocity curve depicted in fig 8 emin is more fuel efficient than pmin even though it requires more power because it allows for greater velocity and therefore less flight time because energy is the product of power and time reducing time by increasing velocity can reduce energetic costs below those of pmin the final velocity tmin at which total flight time is minimized can be determined trigonometrically by calculating the tangent of the power velocity curve which passes through an intercept equal to the negative value of the rate at which fuel is gained on stopovers fig 8 see also alerstam and lindström 1990 tmin requires sufficiently more power than emin that it requires added energy costs despite the time savings over the course of migration pmin confers no energetic advantage and does not lead to shorter migration time and therefore may represent a physical constraint fig 8 see also pennycuick 1975 that is mass may limit a bird s ability to optimize flight velocity for time versus distance with larger birds being constrained to velocities closer to pmin and smaller birds being able to choose between emin and tmin pennycuick 1997 bruderer and boldt 2001 see also la sorte et al 2013 for population scale migration speed however even birds on the more massive end of the spectrum considered by bruderer and boldt 2001 like mallards showed appreciable flight velocity ranges in any event careful consideration must be made when basing expectations for optimal bird flight on theory as theoretical and observed flight velocities vary pennycuick 1997 pennycuick et al 2013 the vertex of the parabola defined by eq 12 and depicted in fig 8 defined along the y axis as pmin can be thought of as the body mass above which an increase in power results in an increase in speed and below which an increase in power results in a decrease in speed that is assuming an equal exertion of power more massive birds will fly at a slower speed than less massive birds this threshold body mass m t h r e s h o l d is calculable and equals 1 16 so as weight fluctuates over the course of the year birds with body mass above m t h r e s h o l d will fly at a lower velocity while exerting the same power as birds with body masses below m t h r e s h o l d demonstrated mathematically by rearranging eq 12 for v m r yielding two solutions 14 v m r 1 161 3 819 1 610 000 p m r 23 189 059 the function is when m m t h r e s h o l d and when m m t h r e s h o l d this results in a v m r in meters per second to convert to kilometers per hour we simply divide by 1000 1000 m e t e r s k i l o m e t e r and multiply the result by 3600 60 s e c o n d s m i n u t e 60 m i n u t e s h o u r 2 4 5 body mass fat flight velocity and flight range flight velocity and fat reserves together dictate the maximal range a migrant can travel much as one would when calculating the maximum distance for an automobile to travel knowing the target speed and the state of the fuel tank provides a reasonable expectation for total distance available ignoring aspects such as wind speed drag coefficient of the body in motion etc by multiplying the body mass by the expected proportion of the body mass composed of fat we obtain the expected fat reserves in kg multiplying expected fat reserves by the kilojoules to grams conversion of 39 700 kj per kg rayner 1990 comparable to 9 kilocalories per gram 4 184 kj per kcal 37 656 kj per kg from ricklefs 1974 yields the available fat reserves in terms of energy kj using the relations for the cost of flight per unit time and per unit distance from eqs 3 and 4 the equation for flight range fr is then 15 f r m ψ c t v m r using the body fat body mass proportion of 13 for ψ 2 4 6 temperature flight velocity flight range and stopover time the distance a bird flies the velocity with which it covers that distance and the thermal landscape with which it interacts all act in concert to dictate the length of time a migrant is likely to spend at a stopover stopovers are essential components of the migratory journey for many waterfowl lindström 1990 weber and houston 1997 hope et al 2011 providing opportunities to gain energy and increase fat stores depleted during flight although some individuals have been found to complete the journey in one non stop flight krementz et al 2011 2012 stopovers are also the points of greatest predation risk along the migration route particularly when individuals must make tradeoffs between foraging time and vigilance metcalfe and furness 1984 lima 1986 moore et al 1990 krapu and reinecke 1992 cimprich and moore 1999 schaub and jenni 2001 hope et al 2011 hagy et al 2014 total stopover time comprises the number of stops made during migration and the length of time spent at each stopover site under the same assumptions as we imposed for defining departure date that a bird will only move when faced with energetic deficiency a bird will remain at a stopover for as long as it is energetically beneficial to do so qualitatively this reduces to a strategy of staying ahead of the front of cold weather as shown in fig 9 to quantify this value stopover time s t we calculate the mean number of days for which energetic gains exceed energetic costs for every location in the autumn and spring migratory period windows the light gray shaded regions in fig 9 where locations are arbitrary nodes as in metabolic rate and departure date 16 s t d a y s e i n e o u t 2 4 7 landscape model of the full migratory process to extend the migration schedules and apply the formulations discussed above across a more representative landscape we simulated 41 temperature regimes across a large area 6 000 000 km2 and subsequently tested our network of interactions among the variables and dependencies of migration to evaluate their accuracy using empirical data we established a landscape of 6084 nodes 78 78 of dimension 32 19 32 19 km 20 mi 20 mi as in lonsdorf et al 2016 we defined the temperature across this landscape using the mean monthly temperature c of the northern and southern extents of the north american range of mallards as provided by natureserve range maps ridgley et al 2005 and then generated a linear sequence of temperatures from cold to warm to represent decreasing latitude across the landscape we repeated this process temporally generating sequences of temperatures to establish daily records across the landscape for the entire year starting with the end of the breeding period july 1 and running through the following breeding period june 30th of the subsequent calendar year temperature data were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric association s national centers for environmental prediction noaa ncep kalnay et al 1996 to generate multiple temperature regimes to mimic a warming climate we varied the mean monthly temperatures used as input from 2 c to 2 c by increments of 0 1 c therefore a temperature regime of 0 c means that the mean temperature across the landscape is 0 c different than present day northern hemispheric mean temperatures we then converted this thermal landscape to an energetic landscape using the temperature metabolism relation eqs 3 and 4 this created a grid of nodes each defined by the temperature dependent metabolic cost of existence this metabolic cost of existence grid was subtracted from a similar grid of identical dimension representing maximum potential energy gain per node based on the 1 8 bmr basal metabolic rate daily rate of gain to create a final grid that informed the temperature dependent daily rate of energy flux as described in our assumptions above this grid represents the daily temperature dependent energetic landscape defining the net energetic flux a bird would experience in any node at any day during the migration period it is to this landscape that we applied the equations and formulae detailed above we then iterate the process across the suite of mean temperature shifts 2 c to 2 c to identify the effects of varying temperature on the factors of migration this simulation was carried out using r v 3 3 1 r core team 2016 and the code is available as a separate file in the supporting information 3 results 3 1 modeling migration across a landscape results of this simulation were consistent with expectations see fig 10 for graphical display of results the average date of departure or the onset of the non breeding period of the annual cycle ranged from november 11 under the coldest conditions to november 30 under the warmest in their telemetry based study of mallard migration in the mississippi flyway krementz et al 2012 found an average date of departure for their tracked mallards of october 23 with a range from september 17 to december 7 the earlier date of departure observed by krementz et al 2012 may be due to the effects of temperature not on bird physiology per se but rather decreasing seasonal availability of forage a factor we assumed was constant and plentiful mean fat deposits across the temperatures applied ranged from 5927 kj under colder than current conditions to 6014 kj under warmer conditions a difference of 2 this result is in line with the estimated maximum available energy reported by whyte and bolen 1988 and dabbert et al 1997 of 5000 9000 kj as well as that of 6025 kj used in lonsdorf et al 2016 mean flight velocity ranged from 75 44 to 78 05 km hr as the average temperature increased comparable to the estimates from pennycuick et al 2013 70 92 s d 5 58 km hr bruderer and boldt 2001 77 04 s d 8 64 km hr and bellrose and crompton 1981 71 8 s d 11 1 km hr for mallards mean flight ranges extended from 1257 km to 1394 km colder to warmer in excellent agreement with what has been observed for both spring migration 1200 km range 443 2170 km krementz et al 2011 and autumn migration 1400 km range 143 2947 km krementz et al 2012 we note however that both of these figures are from studies initiating in arkansas and ending in the prairie potholes region of the mississippi flyway our landscape considers the equivalent of migration from the hudson bay to the gulf of mexico thus allowing for greater possible distances than krementz et al 2011 2012 could observe average stopover time ranged from 16 7 to 24 7 days cold to warm during spring migration and 11 9 19 0 days cold to warm during autumn migration both of these estimates are reasonable approximations of observations from krementz et al 2011 12 0 9 days for spring and krementz et al 2012 15 4 1 47 days for autumn the shorter observed than predicted stopover time in spring may be attributable to our exclusion of other factors of migration for example spring birds will be migrating following a less energetically demanding period of the annual cycle and thus may begin migration in better body condition than we assumed alternatively birds following leaf out in the spring may refuel more quickly than they can in the fall as a result of increased forage availability our simulation does not include either of these features suggesting that the primary mechanism driving migration in autumn is indeed temperature hence the recovery of accurate stopover times for this period while in the spring there are other factors causing a departure from expected stopover time hence our overestimate 3 2 cessation of migration it is possible that mallards and other dabbling ducks could cease migration given warm enough temperatures we can show this possibility by allowing the average temperature across the simulated landscape to increase above the arbitrarily imposed 2 c limit our simulation considering only the effects of temperature yielded thermal landscapes in which energetic gains exceeded energetic losses in the southern range of current mallard breeding habitat i e above roughly the 49th latitudinal parallel with an average increase in temperature across the landscape of 7 6 c for individuals breeding further south in the southern reaches of the prairie potholes region i e at approximately the 43rd latitudinal parallel migration is expected to cease after a temperature increase of 4 5 c within the range of predicted global surface temperature increase by 2100 ipcc 2014 considering a host of other factors influencing migration patterns and their relation to climate change for instance potential range shifts as the climate warms monahan and hijmans 2008 our estimate for the cessation of migration may even serve as a late estimate i e the confluence of factors affecting migration may lead to mallard populations forgoing seasonal dispersal even sooner than 2100 4 discussion throughout the latter half of the 20th century a great deal of effort was invested in elucidating the physical abilities and physiological constraints of birds particularly waterfowl these efforts have helped pull back the curtain on migration patterns and dynamics and paved the way for increasing interest in quantifying and predicting these patterns and dynamics concurrently climate change has been sufficiently well documented and its potential consequences clearly demonstrated that we can incorporate expectations of a warming climate into our efforts at understanding migration by bridging the gap between these two arenas of migration and climate we have developed testable hypotheses including the expectation of a warming climate lessening energetic demands in more northern latitudes leading to the possibility of more birds opting for more frequent stopovers closer to the breeding grounds during their journey 4 1 expectations for waterfowl migration because temperature interacts with metabolic demands and energetics in a predictable way we can create expected migration schedules using physiological and climatic data under the assumptions of a changing climate these schedules can be expanded by considering the effects of temperature on each of the other down stream variables of migration as well e g body mass flight velocity etc which can be incorporated into continent scale energetics models of avian migration results of our simulation suggest that we may witness a cessation of migration within 80 years for mallards and similar dabbling duck species as a warmer climate leads to more tolerable thermal conditions allowing birds to remain in their breeding grounds over winter the reasons for an expected cessation of migration relate primarily to the direct effects of temperature on migration as the average simulated temperature increases we found waterfowl were expected to experience temperatures below their lct less frequently i e fewer occurrences of 20 c temperatures this reduction in days facing temperature 20 c should result in a metabolic reprieve for migrants allowing migrants to operate metabolic rates within their tnz and allocate more energy to flight or foraging with more energy available the risk of starvation could decrease natural selection then should favor a migration strategy minimizing predation risk flight time and competition by selecting for flight velocities as near to tmin as possible fewer stopovers but of longer duration and later departure minimizing predation risk while flying at tmin is contradictory as optimal fat load for predation minimization is less than optimal fat load for migration speed maximization alerstam and lindström 1990 consequently some sacrifice in speed must be made to minimize predation risk thus natural selection should act such that this sacrifice will be as small as possible under these circumstances near tmin flight velocity fewer longer stopovers later departure the generic migration schedule fig 5d would be expected to shift fig 6 ultimately there may eventually be no autumn departure at all because from an energetics standpoint the early on time late tradeoff is a threshold proportion of the energy required to maintain the basal metabolic rate bmr and the energy available to the bird if sufficient energy in the form of forage material is available to the bird to maintain its bmr it may depart later or forgo migration altogether if temperatures continue to rise at currently expected rates however migrants could decades hence incur the cost of operating a high metabolic rate to cool themselves down and prevent overheating that is they may encounter temperatures exceeding the critical temperature threshold in the future more often than they currently do as more energy is used for metabolic functions fuel deposition rates will decrease i e there will be more time spent foraging as a greater proportion of acquired food is used to account for this increase in energetic demands therefore the pendulum may ultimately reverse direction and favor an optimal migration strategy optimizing energy use again or compelling a range shift to cooler conditions in the north we stress that the finding related to migration cessation is preliminary and subject to considerable influence by factors not considered here for instance we ignored the impact of wind velocity and direction an important driver of migration further we imposed a spatially uniform temperature regime on the environment that is inconsistent with known warming patterns wherein more northerly latitudes increase in temperature more quickly we made these simplifying assumptions for the sake of clarity and to identify solely the effects of temperature on migration we emphasize the importance of exploring these other considerations in future investigations 4 2 comments about framework 4 2 1 indirect effects and feedback interactions among the factors of migration depicted in fig 1 represent the most critically important associations for a rigorous modeling approach but they are not an exhaustive catalog for instance the time when a bird initiates migration will surely have an effect on flight velocity flying faster to make up for a late start for instance and if a bird has a sufficient body mass given the thermal landscape with which it interacts it may complete the migratory journey in a single flight obviating stopovers entirely many of these auxiliary interactions are either functionally subsumed in the associations we do consider or are not relevant to the investigation at hand however there are three indirect or feedback effects that we expand upon here shown as gray dotted lines in fig 1 as they have particular relevance to our efforts and warrant explicit discussion first we detailed the connection between body mass and metabolic rate in the context of temperature dependency but there are also effects of metabolic rate on body mass as a migrant travels it expends energy i e burns body fat and therefore decreases its total body mass while this instantaneous change in the association of metabolic rate and body mass may have observable effects on the timing and outcome of migratory stages it would require a finer spatial and temporal resolution from the input data than is often practicable we therefore ignored this connection in our example simulation however if the data were available potentially through telemetry based studies then this body mass energy interaction might be worth elucidating to evaluate the degree to which it improves the accuracy of theoretical expectations second and similarly flight velocity influences metabolic rate in a generally linear and positive fashion i e faster flight higher metabolic rate again however the resolution of available data is not likely to allow for such instantaneous relationships to be demonstrated additionally the range of velocities at which birds are expected to fly across a sample of temperature regimes is relatively small see below and therefore this fine scale interaction may not be informative finally we anticipate stopover time having indirect effects on body mass by influencing the amount of time spent actively foraging the increase in total body fat and the amount of energy exerted to maintain basal metabolic requirements for the duration of the stopover event our framework focuses exclusively on the thermal landscape and ignores the amount of potentially available foraging material we assume there is more food available than can be consumed future efforts aimed at identifying this connection forage availability across the landscape and decay throughout the non breeding period are on going however 4 2 2 model assumptions our goal was to evaluate exclusively the effect of temperature on the variables of migration so we made several simplifying assumptions to guide our efforts we assumed migrants should maintain optimal sub maximal fat reserves during migration to increase fuel efficiency hedenström 1992 witter and cuthill 1993 klaassen 1996 and assumed a constant level of energy increase following lindström and kvist 1995 and kvist and lindström 2003 lindström and kvist 1995 suggested a daily rate of gain equivalent to 4 6 bmr basal metabolic rate for passerines and kvist and lindström 2003 found that a scaling factor of 3 10 bmr was reasonable for some european species of wading birds the most parsimonious value for our situation was 1 8 bmr the difference between the value used here and those used by lindström and kvist 1995 and kvist and lindström 2003 is attributable to differences in body mass of target organisms larger bodied birds require fewer multiples of bmr this value is consistent with a strategy which 1 optimizes stopover time during migration by stopping often enough to maintain sufficient energy reserves for flight detours if inclement weather should arise richardson 1978 klaassen 1996 pennycuick 1997 newton 2006 and 2 favors foraging without regard for exposure risk at stopovers lindström and kvist 1995 piersma 2002 guillemain et al 2004 alves et al 2013 this approach minimizes the risk of starvation by maintaining energy reserves above dangerously low levels and avoids excessive time spent at stopover sites by gaining energy back refueling as quickly as possible this refueling rate may not be the same as constant foraging however as there is an increased energy cost associated with constant foraging activity therefore refueling as quickly as possible means refueling faster than an individual would if it remained vigilant of predators but slower than non stop foraging in sum we expected energetically optimal migration to favor on time departure flight velocity near emin optimal stopover number and refueling rate and below maximum fat reserves we assumed a 365 day calendar year ignoring years with a leap day second the procedure for defining the thermal landscape assumed a constant temperature across longitudes see animation in supporting information furthermore we assumed breeding and wintering ground ranges did not shift as the mean temperature across the landscape changed and we expected individuals will depart on time relative to leaf out in the spring and iced over waterways in the autumn jonzén et al 2006 2007 van wijk et al 2012 si et al 2015 this approach maximized the available food for migrants and facilitated more energy efficient foraging activity and reduced to a selection for departure when energy outputs exceed inputs we also ignored the effects of hunting and predation and assumed sufficient forage next we assumed individuals are most likely to fly nearest to emin vmr to maintain fuel efficient locomotion greenewalt 1975 pennycuick 1975 alerstam and lindström 1990 allowing each of these assumptions to vary across their observed range of variation should lead to a much wider migration profile than our model suggested 4 2 3 additional areas of uncertainty the major elements depicted in fig 1 are expected to vary stochastically but some parameters are likely under greater physiological control than others for instance we can expect that the power of a bird in flight would vary relatively little in comparison to the initial body mass distribution of birds readying for migration especially as birds in some years and locations may face a drought or surfeit of forage spatial and temporal variation in forage availability would influence stopover length as well thus those aspects of migration undergoing the greatest stochastic variability are those to which species are most likely to respond behaviorally whereas those under physiological control are least variable 4 3 generalization of model while the framework laid out here and the corresponding code is easily modified to generalize this model to other avian species there is a great deal of work required in reviewing the literature for necessary parameters or for some species to conduct the necessary experimental investigations to identify unknown parameters the pertinent variables are presented in table 1 along with the sources for their parameterization for mallards some of these values will be easily obtainable for many species e g body mass flight velocity while others are likely to prove elusive e g foraging time metabolic rate variables in the absence of species specific parameter values the values for closely related species may need to be relied upon for others allometry may prove insightful e g nagy 1987 mckechnie and wolf 2004 increased experimental and literature review efforts aimed at elucidating these values for model organisms from other genera would broaden the applicability of our approach the mallard like ducks we focused our model on were initially treated as simple bags of calories acquiring and expending energy in the course of movement the approach of building energy based movement models from first principles by explicating the expenditure and acquisition of calories understanding which parameters of migration are physiologically versus behaviorally constrained could prove fruitful to those wishing to develop similar models for non avian taxa 5 conclusions given their large spatial distributions migratory nature and reliance on increasingly fragmented and isolated habitats between wintering and breeding grounds birds in general and waterfowl in particular are of special interest to conservation and management efforts bateman et al 2016 gorzo et al 2016 lebrun et al 2016 evidence of declines among populations of these species is evidence of trouble across space and time identifying those species and catching them at the right times is difficult stanton et al 2016 because of the multiple spatial and temporal scales at which migration operates therefore we require methods for predicting patterns of migration at various scales by integrating local level monitoring programs and the data they produce e g aagaard et al 2015 with large scale modeling techniques lonsdorf et al 2016 we can meet this need the true utility of such models however is fully realized only when we can adequately describe past and current observed patterns and predict how these patterns will change in the future we aim to make use of the accelerating growth of evidence of global climate change and the copious body of literature pertaining to waterfowl physiology to extend a modeling framework currently implemented to explain waterfowl migration patterns in north america lonsdorf et al 2016 by focused our efforts on the role of temperature in the energetic gains and losses of migrating waterfowl we can begin to develop expectations for how patterns will shift and how when migration may cease in a warmer climate acknowledgements this work was

25297,we have developed a dynamic epidemiological model informed by records of viral presence and genotypes to evaluate potential transmission routes maintaining a viral pathogen in economically and culturally important anadromous fish populations in the columbia river basin infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus ihnv causes severe disease predominantly in juvenile steelhead trout oncorhynchus mykiss and less frequently in chinook salmon o tshawytscha mortality events following ihnv infection can be devastating for individual hatchery programs despite reports of high local mortality and extensive surveillance efforts there are questions about how viral transmission is maintained modeling this system offers important insights into disease transmission in natural aquatic systems as well as about the data requirements for generating accurate estimates about transmission routes and infection probabilities we simulated six scenarios in which testing rates and the relative importance of different transmission routes varied the simulations demonstrated that the model accurately identified routes of transmission and inferred infection probabilities accurately when there was testing of all cohort sites when testing records were incomplete the model accurately inferred which transmission routes exposed particular cohort sites but generated biased infection probabilities given exposure after validating the model and generating guidelines for result interpretation we applied the model to data from 14 annual cohorts 2000 2013 at 24 focal sites in a sub region of the columbia river basin the lower columbia river lcr to quantify the relative importance of potential transmission routes in this focal sub region we demonstrate that exposure to ihnv via the return migration of adult fish is an important route for maintaining ihnv in the lcr sub region and the probability of infection following this exposure was relatively high at 0 16 although only 1 of cohort sites experienced self exposure by infected juvenile fish this transmission route had the greatest probability of infection 0 22 increased testing and or determining whether transmission can occur from cohort sites without testing records e g determining there was no testing record because there were no fish at the cohort site are expected to improve inference about infection probabilities increased use of secure water supplies and continued use of biosecurity protocols may reduce ihnv transmission from adult fish and juvenile fish within the site respectively to juvenile salmonids at hatcheries models and conclusions from this study are potentially relevant to understanding the relative importance of transmission routes for other important aquatic pathogens in salmonids including the agents of bacterial kidney disease and coldwater disease and the basic approach may be useful for other pathogens and hosts in other geographic regions keywords ihnv salmon steelhead trout transmission viral genotype sei model 1 introduction dynamic models both statistical and mathematical that categorize host populations by susceptible exposed infected recovered seir status have been important tools for describing pathogen transmission although much of the work has focused on human and livestock systems even simple seir models can capture enough of the critical transmission process to inform disease control measures e g anderson and may 1979 1992 bjornstad et al 2002 smith et al 2014 however while all models are limited by the availability and quality of the data to inform and validate parameterization this is a significant challenge in modeling infectious transmission in non human systems where even fundamental estimates of host population size are often uncertain heisey et al 2010 ladeau et al 2011 morris et al 2015 wildlife populations are difficult to access and monitor and consequently infection dynamics are often poorly understood semi wildlife systems with a combination of free ranging animals and husbandry programs at various stages of animals life history such as those associated with salmon oncorhynchus mykiss salmo salar and carp cyprinus carpio have provided some of the most productive application of seir models to investigate transmission of infectious pathogens in non human systems previous studies have evaluated drivers of epidemics likely infection routes effect of distance to an infectious fish farm on transmission and epidemic control options through the use of compartment models and population dependent and independent transmission models e g murray 2006 aldrin et al 2010 taylor et al 2011 in this paper we build on the existing literature to develop and apply a dynamic epidemiological model that categorizes and tracks transitions from susceptible to infected host groups in anadromous fish populations of the columbia river basin the model evaluates the role of potential transmission routes in maintaining a viral pathogen with specific consideration for how missing data influence identification of critical transmission routes infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus ihnv species salmonid novirhabdovirus proliferates in a semi wildlife system with intensive data collection at critical life stages and in this sense represents an important system for making data driven inference about transmission in the wild the model structure and evaluation presented offer important insights into disease transmission in natural aquatic systems as well as about the data requirements for generating accurate inference about transmission routes and infection probabilities once key transmission routes are identified opportunities for surveillance intervention and control can be enhanced archie et al 2009 aldrin et al 2011 the columbia river basin is a large complex watershed that occupies much of the states of washington oregon and idaho as well as smaller portions of other states and two canadian provinces a large number of fish culture facilities hatcheries in the columbia river basin support breeding and juvenile rearing of the predominant wild salmonid species in the watershed including chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha and steelhead trout oncorhynchus mykiss juvenile hatchery fish are released from freshwater hatcheries to migrate to the ocean where they spend the majority of their lives before returning to freshwater natal sites including hatcheries to breed therefore this is a semi wildlife system where populations of diverse species mix and disperse across a complex landscape aldrin et al 2011 2015 with intense human management and data collection at the beginning and end of the fishes life cycle infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus ihnv species salmonid novirhabdovirus an rna virus of the rhabdovirus family is endemic to the pacific northwest of north america and currently infects a broad range of salmonid species globally bootland and leong 2011 dixon et al 2016 in the columbia river basin ihn disease is predominantly observed in juvenile steelhead and occasionally in chinook salmon bootland and leong 1999 breyta et al 2016a mortality events following ihnv infection at a hatchery can result in the loss of an entire juvenile cohort and can be devastating for individual hatchery programs wolf 1988 lapatra 1998 bootland and leong 1999 spawning adults returning to hatcheries are routinely tested for a suite of pathogens including ihnv but ihnv infection is largely asymptomatic in adult steelhead and chinook thus ihnv infection in adult fish is detected mostly through routine surveillance testing in contrast infection in juvenile fish is most often detected by diagnostic testing of moribund or dead fish with a smaller component of routine surveillance testing throughout the columbia river basin surveillance and diagnostic testing is currently conducted by seven distinct groups in the columbia river basin including federal state and tribal agencies breyta et al 2016a 2017a if a test is negative for ihnv the chance of a false negative is very low because in regions where the virus is routinely detected a sampling method with a lower limit of detection between 5 9 is used in regions where the virus is not routinely detected sampling with a lower detection limit of 1 5 2 is used a lower detection limit of 5 means that if ihnv were present in at least 5 of the fish it would be detected salmonid populations in the columbia river basin are both culturally and economically important due to the extensive programmatic losses and economic costs associated with fish mortality following ihnv infection the molecular and immunological characteristics of the virus have been well documented bootland and leong 2011 genotyping of ihnv isolates has been used for molecular epidemiological studies across the endemic region garver et al 2003 kurath et al 2003 breyta et al 2016a b and globally nishizawa et al 2006 enzmann et al 2010 kurath 2012 viral genotypes isolated from ihnv positive fish at north american hatcheries are defined by sequencing a 303 nucleotide segment of the viral glycoprotein gene called the midg region data are publically available in the meap ihnv database http gis nacse org ihnv the genotyping method detects the majority genotype with a lower limit of detection of minority genotypes around 10 20 for the purpose of studying transmission mechanisms knowing the majority genotype is sufficient because transmission is a bottleneck event i e only a few genomes likely establish a new infection ihn virology testing data collected by each of seven fish health agencies in the columbia river basin from 2000 to 2012 along with available genotyping data have been compiled in a novel database linking fish species fish age class testing location test date test type and test result breyta et al 2017b this database of ihnv virological and genetic surveillance data is referred to hereafter as the ihnv vgs database although ihn disease outbreaks in hatcheries can result in high mortality the spatial and temporal frequency of these events is relatively low with an average of 5 of sites having virus positive juveniles for any given year 10 positive sites per year on average 222 total sites with tested juveniles in the ihnv vgs database breyta et al 2017b access data 3 november 2016 as with many disease systems a persistent challenge is differentiating lack of testing from absence of virus testing across all sites in the ihnv vgs database n 324 for the years 2000 2013 occurred at rates of 22 of site years for juvenile fish 27 of site years with diagnostic tests 57 with surveillance tests and 29 with unknown test type because some site years had multiple test types and 36 of site years for adult fish 9 of site years with diagnostic tests 58 with surveillance tests and 44 with unknown test type because some site years had multiple test types positive ihnv results occurred in 14 of tested site years for juveniles and 25 of tested site years for adults controlling viral outbreaks relies on specific understanding of how ihnv is maintained in the environment at local regional and landscape scales while biosecurity protocols at hatcheries are intended to eliminate parent to offspring transmission and cross contamination between fish cohorts inadvertent transmission among hatchery juveniles and transmission by water borne virus entering a hatchery from non secure water sources are possible mulcahy and bauersfeld 1983 mulcahy et al 1983 mulcahy and pascho 1985 bootland and leong 1999 winton 1991 anderson et al 2000 bendorf et al 2007 tompkins et al 2011 breyta et al 2016b it is also possible that juvenile fish that survive clinical ihn disease or were sub clinically infected might be released from hatcheries while still harboring and possibly shedding infectious virus finally asymptomatic adult fish are frequently recorded with high titers of infectious virus at the time of spawning mulcahy et al 1982 bootland and leong 1999 it is not clear whether adult infection is the result of virus acquired during return migration or life long persistence of virus in a small proportion of fish that survive infection as juveniles possibly with virus reactivated in response to stress or reduced immune function at spawning bootland and leong 2011 as described by breyta et al 2017a three transmission routes are potentially responsible for disease in juvenile hatchery fish transmission that occurs r1 between juvenile cohorts within a site r2 from juveniles reared at upstream sites that shed virus into effluent that passes a downstream site or that shed virus as they pass a site during downstream migration or r3 from infectious virus shed by adults returning to the site or passing a site as they swim upstream table 1 and fig 1 while breyta et al 2017a tested these three potential routes of ihnv transmission using a descriptive analysis ecological modeling can best integrate information about spatial testing ihnv positive cohorts and viral genotypes to evaluate support for specific transmission routes at the landscape scale here we first present a simulation analysis of a sei model developed to evaluate viral transmission among salmonid populations throughout the columbia river basin we use the simulation analysis to rigorously evaluate how missing data influence the model s ability to generate accurate estimates about transmission routes and infection probabilities in this semi wild landscape second we demonstrate our first model application using data from 14 cohorts years 2000 2013 at 24 sites located in the lower columbia river lcr this sub region was chosen for a first assessment of model performance because both testing and juvenile infection rates were relatively high at these sites during this period 60 juvenile cohort sites tested 23 of tested juvenile cohort sites positive 70 adult cohort sites tested 59 of tested adult cohort sites positive fig 2 we interpret model results from the lcr sub region in light of conclusions from the simulations to clarify the relative importance of ihnv transmission routes in the lcr sub region and discuss implications for the management of hatcheries 2 methods we developed a dynamic susceptible exposed infected sei model the ihnv tg3r testing genotyping three route model that is informed by testing and genotyping data to identify the transmission route by which sites were exposed to ihnv and estimate infection probabilities given that transmission route pr for transmission route r fig 3 the model is implemented in a bayesian statistical framework where unknown parameters are defined by probability distributions link and barker 2010 simulations were used to validate and characterize the performance of the model under a range of parameter combinations that represented different biological scenarios the simulations were also used to highlight the effects of missing data on the accuracy of results after validating the model and generating guidelines for result interpretation we applied the model to data from the lcr to quantify the relative importance of potential transmission routes in this focal sub region data available in the ihnv vgs database breyta et al 2017b for the 24 focal sites in the lcr sub region include the date of testing the site coordinates where each cohort was tested species and age class juvenile or adult of fish tested whether tests were positive or negative for ihnv and viral genotype for a subset of positive records for the purposes of model validation and initial conclusions we have combined data across all fish species tested in the lcr sub region this includes the predominant species in the ihnv vgs database steelhead trout anadromous oncorhynchus mykiss 47 of tested cohort sites 74 of ihnv positive juvenile cohort sites and chinook salmon o tshawytscha 59 of tested cohort sites 17 of ihnv positive juvenile cohort sites as well as rainbow trout freshwater o mykiss sockeye salmon anadromous o nerka kokanee salmon freshwater o nerka coho salmon o kisutch and seven non focal hosts that collectively comprise less than 5 of the records in the database breyta et al 2017a within our focal lcr sub region testing of steelhead chinook and other species were equally frequent across cohort sites table 2 however juvenile steelhead tested positive for ihnv at the highest rate testing and positive tests were more frequent for adult fish compared to juvenile fish table 2 when discussing rates of testing in particular species specific rates it is important to consider that the ihnv vgs database does not include information about the species that were present at specific sites across time the database only has testing records so we do not know when a species was present but not tested consequently the testing rates presented here may be underestimated in the next sub sections we first define the model and then describe how we tested the model with simulated data finally we explain how the model and data from the lcr sub region were used to quantify ihnv transmission dynamics within that sub region 2 1 model structure 2 1 1 age classes and cohorts we focused on modeling infection at juvenile life stages because this is when ihn disease causes the greatest mortality in columbia river basin fishes the model estimates the probability that juvenile fish at a particular site were infected during a given cohort defined as all juvenile fish tested from june 1 may 31 these dates were used to define a juvenile cohort because a juvenile class is typically reared from summer spring depending on the species and most juvenile testing occurs in late winter or early spring table a1 fig a1 an adult cohort was defined as all adult fish tested at a site from august 1 july 31 adult fishes are typically at a freshwater site from early fall to late spring and most adult testing occurs in the fall or winter table a1 fig a2 we use the term cohort site to refer to a particular site i e 1 of the 24 focal sites in the lcr sub region during a particular cohort i e 1 of the 14 cohorts from 2000 to 2013 there are then 336 24 focal sites 14 fish cohorts potential cohort sites in our model 2 1 2 possible transmission routes the possible transmission routes fig 1 table 1 modeled were r1 between consecutive juvenile cohorts at site i r2 from juveniles being reared at or migrating downstream from a site j located upstream from site i and r3 from adults returning to site i or any upstream site j table 1 fig 1 these can be considered three independent transmission routes that may occur alone or in combination when considered in combination there are seven possible transmission routes r1 only r2 only r3 only r1 and r2 abbreviated r12 r1 and r3 abbreviated r13 r2 and r3 abbreviated r23 and r1 and r2 and r3 abbreviated r123 an eighth exposure class was also possible where a cohort site was not exposed to ihnv 2 1 3 probabilities of infection for juvenile cohort sites for the first cohort of juveniles t 1 at each site it was not possible to infer which transmission routes exposed the cohort because there was no information identifying which cohort sites were previously infectious therefore the infection process for the first cohort was modeled as a bernoulli trial with a constant probability of infection we also assumed a constant probability of infection for adults at all sites in all cohorts in other words the model used data identifying when cohort sites were tested and which were infected but the infection process was modeled as a bernoulli trial with a constant probability of infection for juvenile cohorts where t 1 the model first determined which transmission routes were possible and then estimated route specific probabilities of infection pr for each cohort site table 1 fig 3 for the first step we assumed that exposure by r1 was possible at site i in cohort t if it had a positive juvenile test in the previous cohort t 1 we assumed that r2 was possible if any upstream site among the 24 focal sites j had a positive juvenile test in the same or previous cohort t or t 1 and we assumed that r3 was possible if there was a positive adult test in the same or previous cohort t or t 1 at the site or any upstream site i or j upstream sites j were defined as any sites among the 24 focal sites in the lcr sub region from which effluent water flowed past site i and all sites 1 km from the mainstem were considered to functionally be on the mainstem after the possible transmission routes were determined for cohort t site i we calculated the associated probability of infection given possible exposure pr to model probabilities of infection that were dependent on the transmission routes we used three structural parameters that each represented the probability of infection for one route independent of the other two routes ir for transmission route r the probabilities of the seven possible transmission routes were computed by multiplying the independent probabilities of infection or their complements for example p3 1 i1 1 i2 i3 meaning that the probability of infection given exposure by r3 is the product of the probability of independent infection by r3 infection by r3 was possible and the compliments of the probabilities of independent infection by r1 or r2 infection by r1 or r2 were not possible if only one transmission route was possible for a given cohort site the composite probability of infection for cohort t site i ct i was equal to that route s probability of infection if multiple transmission routes were possible the composite probability of infection for cohort t site i was equal to the sum of the probabilities associated with the possible routes i e composite probability of infection if r1 only and r12 were possible p1 p12 in the simulated scenarios the independent probabilities of infection were chosen so that the maximum composite probability of infection was similar across each simulated scenario table 3 the maximum composite probability of infection was the sum of the route specific probabilities for all 7 possible routes which are comprised of all possible combinations of r1 r2 and r3 2 1 4 genotype support for transmission routes we used the viral genotypes in the ihnv vgs database breyta et al 2017b which were available for a subset of positive ihnv tests to help discriminate among possible transmission routes viral genotypes were available for 78 of ihnv positive juvenile cohort sites and 68 of ihnv positive adult cohort sites in the lcr sub region once possible transmission routes were defined in the model we further determined which of the possible routes were most likely based on comparing genotypes between infected and potentially transmitting sites for the current model we only considered genotypes that were identical to be informative matches for example if the model determined that r1 only r2 only and r12 were possible in the absence of genotype data the composite probability of infection for the cohort site ct i would be equal to the sum of the three route specific probabilities of infection pr if however there was genotype support for r1 exposure by r2 only would be rejected and the composite probability of infection for the cohort site would be equal to p1 p12 if there was genotype support for both r1 and r2 and there were different genotypes for the two routes meaning two genotypes were detected at cohort t site i and one genotype was detected at site i in the previous cohort t 1 providing support for r1 while the other genotype was detected in a juvenile at an upstream site j in cohort t providing support for r2 exposure by r1 only would be rejected leaving r12 as the only possible transmission route however if there was genotype support for both r1 and r2 and they had the same genotype there was no evidence supporting one route over the other so inferentially this was equivalent to having no genotype data once the set of possible transmission routes for a cohort site were determined infection was modeled as the outcome of a bernoulli trial with the composite probability of infection 2 1 5 missing data and informative priors in our model inference is based primarily on patterns in positive and negative tests for ihnv inference about the role of possible transmission routes and the probabilities of infection associated with transmission routes can be impaired by having many cohort sites with an unknown infection status for example if the model is determining which routes could have exposed cohort t site i to ihnv but it is not known whether juveniles at an upstream site j were infected there is uncertainty in whether r2 could have led to exposure which translates to uncertainty in the composite probability of infection for the cohort site if a cohort site was not tested for ihnv 40 of juvenile cohort sites and 30 of adult cohort sites in the lcr sub region it is unclear whether the absence of a test occurred because the site had no evidence of disease this is particularly likely for juvenile fish that are often tested only if disease is suspected no fish were reared during that cohort or the agency conducting testing did not report test results for any other reason fig 2 without knowing why there was no test the model attempts to infer the unknown infection status based on the informative prior discussed below we used informative priors for 1 the probability that a juvenile cohort site was infected when there was no testing and 2 the probability that an adult cohort site was infected when there was no testing we expect these probabilities to approximate the positive rate in surveillance tests since surveillance testing is designed to be routine and independent of the infection state we assumed infection rates observed from these tests were representative of infection rates at untested cohort sites more details are presented below as they apply to the simulation analysis and lcr sub region data 2 1 6 inference the model operated by looping through cohorts and sites see supplementary materials code lines 71 72 for a given cohort site the ihn virology testing data from that site and any upstream sites were checked code lines 73 94 if there was a positive test from a juvenile fish at that site in the previous cohort exposure by r1 between juvenile cohorts within a site was considered possible if there was a positive test from a juvenile fish at any upstream site in the previous or current cohort exposure by r2 virus shed by juveniles that pass a site either in effluent or as the infected juveniles migrate downstream was considered possible if there was a positive test from an adult fish at the site or any upstream site in the previous or current cohort exposure by r3 virus shed by adults returning to the site or passing the site as they swim upstream was considered possible when sites were examined for possible transmission routes any possible source of transmission resulted in the relevant transmission route being deemed possible the number of possible sources of transmission did not affect the chance of exposure or infection for example if there was 1 upstream site with a positive test from a juvenile fish transmission by r2 was considered possible likewise if there were 5 upstream sites with positive tests from juvenile fish transmission by r2 was deemed possible and the probability of infection associated with exposure by r2 was the same whether there was 1 or 5 infected sites upstream we structured the model this way because testing records in the ihnv vgs database do not indicate the abundance of fish at a cohort site also the current model did not incorporate distance between sites into a calculation of exposure or infection probability but work on this model extension is ongoing next the viral genotyping data were examined to identify transmission routes with genotype support based on identical genotype matches see genotype support for transmission routes section above and transition from s to e compartments in fig 3 after the set of possible transmission routes was compiled for the cohort site a composite probability of infection was calculated see probabilities of infection for juvenile cohort sites section above code lines 96 156 the observed infection status was modeled as the outcome of a bernoulli trial with a probability of success equal to the composite probability of infection if the infection status was unknown it was inferred and modeled as the outcome of a bernoulli trial with a probability of success equal to an informative prior see missing data and informative priors section above transition from e to i compartments in fig 3 and code lines 161 163 the known values entered in the model were 1 cohort sites with juvenile or adult testing 2 cohort sites with positive juvenile or adult tests 3 cohort sites with genotype support for r1 r2 or r3 and 4 a matrix of the sites upstream of each site posterior distributions were approximated for the probability of independent infection for each of the three transmission routes i1 i2 i3 the probability of infection for juveniles in the first cohort co1 the probability of infection for an untested juvenile cohort site the probability of infection for an untested adult cohort site and the probability of infection for a tested adult cohort site we used vague uniform 0 1 priors except for the informative priors as defined below code lines 27 33 we ran models in openbugs 3 2 3 lunn et al 2009 using the r2openbugs package and r 3 2 2 r core team 2013 sturtz et al 2005 we ran three markov chain monte carlo mcmc chains with 75 000 iterations a burn in of 45 000 and thinning of 1 convergence was assessed with the gelman rubin potential scale reduction factor r hat and chains were considered converged if r hat 1 04 for all parameters brooks and gelman 1998 gelman and shirley 2011 after convergence we obtained the mean of parameters posterior distributions and 95 bayesian credible intervals bci 2 2 simulated data 2 2 1 scenarios we conducted simulation analyses to evaluate how missing data influenced the model s ability to generate accurate estimates about transmission routes and infection probabilities we ran 50 simulations of each of six scenarios defined to capture different combinations of data availability and predominant transmission routes table 3 we used the ihnv vgs database breyta et al 2017b to inform the simulations so four of the scenarios had incomplete testing approximately 60 of juvenile cohort sites tested based on 200 tested juvenile cohort sites in the lcr sub region 336 possible juvenile cohort sites in the lcr fig 2 and either a high probability of independent infection for one of the transmission routes or equal independent probabilities of infection for the 3 transmission routes one scenario had testing of all cohort sites and the last simulated scenario was based on the posterior distributions from the model fit to the real lcr sub region data we simulated a scenario to represent the results from the model fit to real data from the lcr sub region to generate additional insights into model performance and assist with interpretation of model results the order of sites i e which sites were upstream j from each site i and the genotype data from the lcr sub region sites were used in all simulated scenarios data regarding which cohort sites were tested and which tested sites were ihnv positive were simulated 2 2 2 missing data and informative priors since many cohort sites in the lcr sub region did not have ihnv testing data the model was designed to infer the unknown infection status which affected the determination of possible transmission routes and composite infection probabilities for subsequent cohort sites in the application with real data from the lcr sub region we based the informative prior on the positive rate from surveillance tests because whether a cohort site has a surveillance test should be independent of the infection state in the simulation analysis we simulated low rates of infection at untested cohort sites and used informative priors when fitting the model because the positive rate from real surveillance tests tended to be low 0 7 for juveniles in the lcr sub region 1 positive test out of 138 surveillance tests and 1 9 for juveniles across all sites in the ihnv vgs database 15 positive tests out of 788 surveillance tests breyta et al 2017b to represent different probabilities of infection depending on whether cohort sites were tested it was expedient to simulate different probabilities of testing depending on whether a cohort site was infected but it amounts to the same pattern if there was simulated infection of juveniles or adults at a cohort site i e the true infection status that is a latent variable in the estimating model the probability of testing was 0 98 otherwise it was 0 6 table 3 the mean probability of adult infection given no test was 0 0408 this was calculated as the probability of not testing a cohort site with infected adults 0 5 0 02 divided by the sum of the probability of not testing a cohort site with infected adults and the probability of not testing a cohort site with uninfected adults 0 5 0 4 where 0 5 is the probability of adult infection table 3 similarly the mean probability of adult infection given a test was 0 62 this was calculated as the probability of testing a cohort site with infected adults 0 5 0 98 divided by the sum of the probability of testing a cohort site with infected adults and the probability of testing a cohort site with uninfected adults 0 5 0 6 therefore in the estimating model we used a beta 486 prior which has a mean of 0 04 and sd of 0 02 for the probability of adult infection given no test and a beta 14 589 prior which has a mean of 0 62 and sd of 0 03 for the probability of adult infection given a test the mean probability of juvenile infection given no test was 0 007 this was calculated as the probability of not testing a cohort site with infected juveniles 0 13 0 02 divided by the sum of the probability of not testing a cohort site with infected juveniles and the probability of not testing a cohort site with uninfected juveniles 0 87 0 4 the mean probability of infection 0 13 was calculated from one run of simulated infections and is consistent with rates observed in the ihnv vgs database 11 infection among all cohort sites 23 infection among lcr cohort sites breyta et al 2017b in the estimating model we used a beta 3182 prior which has a mean of 0 02 and sd of 0 01 for the probability of infection given no test the probability of infection given a test was dependent on the possible transmission routes for the cohort site as described above 2 2 3 model validation by using simulations we were able to compare parameter posterior distributions to those values used to simulate data thereby evaluating the performance of our transmission model under different testing and infection scenarios for each simulated scenario we determined the bias of posterior distribution means posterior mean value used to simulate data the mean width of parameters 95 bcis and the proportion of simulations where the true value of a parameter was outside the 95 bci we also computed the mean proportion of cohort sites that were possibly infected by each of the transmission routes and we determined the proportion of cohort sites where the inferred transmission route did not match the true transmission route in the simulated scenario meant to represent sites in the lcr sub region we also evaluated posterior probabilities of infection given exposure by each of the seven possible transmission routes pr 2 3 data from the lower columbia river sub region after evaluating the model with simulated data we fit the model to real data this procedure allowed for the interpretation of results from real data with a better understanding of how incomplete testing influences inference about infection probabilities and the relative importance of ihnv transmission routes we used data from all species tested at the 24 lcr sub region sites from 2000 to 2013 where an age class juvenile or adult and cohort based on testing date could be determined data regarding which cohort sites were tested which tested sites were ihnv positive viral genotypes and the order of sites were obtained from the ihnv vgs database breyta et al 2017b to generate the informative prior for the probability that an untested adult cohort site was infected we calculated that the positive rate from surveillance tests was 0 26 164 tests with 42 positive therefore we used a beta 122 354 prior which has a mean of 0 26 and sd of 0 02 we used a vague uniform 0 1 prior for the probability of infection of a tested adult cohort site the positive rate from juvenile surveillance tests was 0 007 138 surveillance tests with 1 positive so we used a beta 0 5 68 prior which has a mean of 0 007 and sd of 0 01 for the probability that an untested juvenile cohort site was infected we report the posterior mean and 95 bci for structural parameters and the probability of infection for each of the seven possible transmission routes pr and we determined the transmission routes that possibly exposed each cohort site we interpret these results in light of conclusions from the simulations for a sensitivity analysis we relaxed the assumptions about fish movement in two ways and refit the model to the data from the 24 focal sites in the lcr sub region first we assumed that upstream sites further than 100 km from a site could not expose the downstream site this could occur if adult fish returning to a distant upstream site do not spend much time by a faraway downstream site and or if effluent from distant upstream sites is diluted to below an infectious dose during travel to faraway downstream sites second we assumed that sites on tributaries within 5 km of the mainstem of the columbia river were functionally on the mainstem this could happen if fish take side trips up tributaries during their path farther upstream in the case of adults or to the ocean in the case of juveniles suppose a site x was on a tributary 4 km from the mainstem of the columbia river and there was a site y upstream on the mainstem with site x functionally on the main steam site y is now considered upstream of site x so an infectious adult fish swimming upstream to site y could now expose site x these fish movement assumptions affect the determination of which transmission routes could expose a cohort site 3 results 3 1 simulated data for each scenario we evaluated how the model performed in terms of 1 identifying the operating transmission route and 2 the probability of infection given exposure by a particular route in all simulated scenarios the model was very successful at identifying the transmission route that exposed cohort sites the frequency of misidentifying the transmission route exposing a cohort site to ihnv was very low in all simulated scenarios fig 4 in the scenario with complete testing of all cohort sites our model accurately estimated each parameter table 4 however in simulations with incomplete testing of cohort sites posterior estimates for parameters were largely unbiased with the exception of the probability of infectious transmission from adult fish i3 and probability of juvenile infection in the first cohort which were biased high in all simulated parameter combinations table 4 bias was greatest in the scenario with a high probability of infection from juvenile migrants i2 and lowest in the scenario with a high probability of infection by adults i3 table 4 by considering where the value used to simulate data fell within the posterior distribution we found that the proportion of simulations where the true value of the probability of infectious transmission from adult fish was outside the 95 bci was greatest when there was a high probability of infection by adults and only below 0 2 when there was a high probability of infection from r1 or complete testing fig 4 the width of the 95 bci is related to the measures of bias since with a less precise i e wider bci there is a smaller chance the true value of the parameter will not be contained within the bci in general bcis were least precise in the r2 high scenario and most precise in the r3 high scenario the r1 high scenario had the lowest frequency of the true probability of independent infection by r3 falling outside the bci and a less precise bci 0 48 width for this parameter table 5 fig 4 in the r2 high scenario the probability of independent infection by r3 was most biased and had its least precise bci also the bci for the probability of independent infection by r1 was its least precise tables 4 and 5 in the r3 high scenario the probability of independent infection by r3 was least biased had its most precise bci and had its highest frequency of the true value falling outside the bci also the bci for the probability of independent infection by r2 was its most precise tables 4 and 5 fig 4 among the three probabilities of independent infection infection by r3 had the least precise bci in all simulated scenarios except in the r3 high scenarios in which the three bcis had similar precisions but infection by r1 had the least precise bci table 5 3 2 data from the lower columbia river sub region the model fit to real data from 336 cohort sites in the lcr sub region inferred that exposure by infectious adult fish r3 occurred most frequently 41 of cohort sites and exposure within a site r1 occurred at 1 of cohort sites fig 5 infectious transmission by adults or upstream juveniles together r23 was a frequent result r23 21 of cohort sites fig 5 the probability of infection following exposure was greatest when exposure occurred between juvenile cohorts within a site r1 and secondarily by r3 table 6 there were relatively large posterior probabilities of infection given exposure by r1 only p1 0 22 r3 only p3 0 16 and r13 p13 0 17 table 6 the composite probability of infection was greatest when the model inferred exposure by r123 fig 6 in this case the testing data indicated that all transmission routes were possible and there was not genotype data that could eliminate some potential routes therefore the composite probability of infection was equal to the sum of all seven route specific probabilities genotype data helped resolve potential transmission routes in four out of the 36 juvenile cohort sites in the lcr sub region that had genotype data for example in two cohort sites r1 only r3 only and r13 were possible based on positive negative test results but genotype data eliminated r1 only the composite probability of infection for these cohort sites was 0 33 but would have been 0 56 without the evidence from the genotype data when we examined inferred transmission routes at specific sites across the landscape r3 was a component of the most frequent transmission route for all exposed sites fig 7 table a2 most sites were frequently exposed by r3 only 11 of 24 focal sites and only two sites were frequently exposed by r13 fig 7 there was a high degree of variation among cohorts in the transmission route operating at a site for example the site frequently exposed by r13 with an upstream site site 15 in table a2 was exposed by r13 in 8 cohorts but exposed by r3 in 4 cohorts and not exposed in 1 cohort most sites were exposed by 3 transmission routes over the 13 cohorts table a2 all but three sites had variable exposure among the 13 cohorts table a2 the model inferred that 3 sites on tributaries with no upstream sites were never exposed in the 13 cohorts two of those sites are upstream of the first dam on the columbia river sites that were not frequently exposed had the lowest mean composite probability of infection across time and the sites that were frequently exposed by r13 had some of the highest mean composite probabilities of infection figs 7 and 8 bci widths were comparable to those in simulated scenarios table 5 3 3 simulation representing lower columbia river sites based on results from the lcr sites we ran another simulation fit to data generated with high probabilities of independent infection by r1 and r3 table 3 represent lcr in this lcr defined scenario two transmission routes were associated with relatively high probabilities of infection whereas in the five simulated scenarios defined a priori and described above only one transmission route had a high probability of infection or all transmission routes had equal probabilities of infection most cohort sites in this scenario were exposed by r3 only but there was also a relatively high proportion of cohort sites exposed by r13 r23 and r123 fig 5 mean bias in the probability of independent infection by r3 was the same as in the equal scenario and r1 high scenario and only the r3 high scenario had a lower mean bias table 4 the true value of the probability of independent infection by r3 was outside the 95 bci in over half of the simulations at a rate similar to the equal scenario fig 4 the probability of infection given exposure by r1 only p1 was most biased low and the probabilities of infection given exposure by r3 only and r13 were most biased high table 7 also the bci was widest for these probabilities the probabilities of infection given exposure by r23 or r123 were most accurate the frequency of the true value falling outside the bci was greatest for the probability of infection given exposure by r12 and was only low for the probability of infection given exposure by r23 or r123 table 7 the sensitivity analysis in which we modified assumptions about fish movement in two ways indicated that results for the lcr sub region were robust tables 6 and 8 under all fish movement assumptions parameter posterior distributions were very similar table 6 there were slight variations in the number of cohort sites exposed by r3 r23 or not exposed table 8 4 discussion we developed a model to evaluate how different transmission routes cause infection in juvenile salmonids the model generates two general types of results 1 identification of which transmission route s likely exposed each juvenile cohort site and 2 the probability of infection associated with each transmission route when the infection status for each cohort site is not known from testing data there is uncertainty in which transmission route s likely exposed each cohort site and consequently uncertainty in the probability of infection for each cohort site therefore the model infers a composite probability of infection for each juvenile cohort site that is a function of 1 the probability of infection associated with each transmission route and 2 the set of transmission routes that may have exposed each juvenile cohort site through simulated scenarios we conducted a thorough evaluation of model performance including characterizing the influence of incomplete testing and variable infectivity among potential transmission routes model performance was assessed in terms of the accuracy and precision of posterior distributions compared to known values used to simulate data to which models were fit a good bayesian model should generate accurate and precise posterior distributions accuracy is assessed by measuring how close the mean of the posterior distribution is to the true value used to simulate data in an unbiased model the posterior mean should equal the true value in a more biased less accurate model the posterior mean will be less similar to the true value in a precise posterior distribution the 95 bci will be narrow indicating little uncertainty in the parameter value also there should be a 0 95 probability that the 95 bci contains the true value after discussing model performance we examine how inference from real data can be interpreted more accurately we also consider how the model can inform hatchery management and be applied to other systems 4 1 simulations our simulation protocol demonstrated that the model structure accurately identified operating routes of transmission and inferred infection probabilities when there was testing of all cohort sites even when testing records were incomplete the model accurately inferred which transmission routes were exposing particular cohort sites but the probability that a cohort was infected given exposure was biased this bias was most evident in estimating probabilities of infection i3 associated with exposure by infectious adults r3 we expect that the probability of independent infection i3 by adults r3 was the most biased parameter for two reasons first there was a relatively high probability of missing an adult infection when a cohort site was not tested 0 26 0 22 0 30 bci compared to 0 03 0 02 0 08 bci for missing a juvenile infection table 6 recall that we used informative priors for the probability that a juvenile or adult cohort site was infected when there was no testing the prior distributions were based on the ihnv positive rates from surveillance tests 0 26 for adults 0 007 for juveniles that are conducted routinely when there are no signs of disease second our model inferred that cohort sites were frequently exposed by infectious adults because it is likely that many untested cohort sites had infected adults but which cohort sites is unknown fig 2 and exposure by infectious adults was a likely explanation for the observed pattern of ihnv infection the model s ability to infer the probability of infection given exposure by adults was impaired the probability of independent infection by adults i3 was most biased in the scenario with a high probability of infection given exposure by upstream juveniles r2 and least biased in the scenario with a high probability of infection given exposure by infectious adults r3 this pattern may be due to two outcomes first exposure within a site r1 and by upstream juveniles r2 were relatively frequent in the scenario with a high probability of infection given exposure by infectious adults r3 and rare in the scenario with a high probability of infection given exposure by upstream juveniles r2 this meant the probabilities of independent infection within a site i1 or by upstream juveniles i2 were inferred based on data from many cohort sites second the composite probabilities of infection were relatively large in the scenario with a high probability of infection given exposure by infectious adults r3 because there often was support for exposure at a cohort site by multiple transmission routes because there was dependence between independent probabilities of infection ir and route specific probabilities of infection pr having data from many cohort sites to infer probabilities of infection in the scenario with a high probability of infection given exposure by infectious adults r3 resulted in relatively accurate inference in the scenario with a high probability of infection given exposure by infectious adults r3 exposure of cohort sites by only infectious adults r3 only infectious adults and within site virus r13 and infectious adults upstream infectious juveniles and within site virus r123 had similar frequencies so many cohort sites had composite probabilities of infection with a large magnitude that were a function of i3 as well as i1 and i2 this contributed to less uncertainty about i3 however in the scenario with a high probability of infection given exposure by upstream juveniles r2 cohort sites were exposed by only infectious adults r3 only much more frequently than by the other routes and composite probabilities of infection were smaller making accurate inference about ir difficult in a related pattern simulated scenarios r3 high equal representing lcr where exposure by r3 only r13 and r123 had high frequencies were also characterized by a narrow bci for i3 and because of that a high frequency of the posterior mean for i3 falling outside the bci fig 4 table 5 with the probability of independent infection by adults i3 being consistently overestimated when there were missing tests patterns of bias in route specific probabilities of infection pr could be expected namely overestimation could be expected for route specific probabilities of infection involving exposure by adults p3 p13 p23 p123 and underestimation could be expected for route specific probabilities of infection not involving exposure by adults p1 p2 p12 this conclusion follows from the equations used to calculate route specific probabilities of infection for example if i3 is over estimated p3 is expected to be overestimated because p3 1 i1 1 i2 i3 as demonstrated by results in tables 4 and 6 we can define general equations to quantify percent bias in route specific probabilities of infection when a probability of independent infection is biased the percent bias for route specific probabilities of infection involving the biased route can be computed as e ir where ir is the true value for the probability of independent infection and e is the magnitude of the bias posterior mean of the overestimated ir true ir similarly the percent bias for route specific probabilities of infection not involving the biased route is equal to e 1 ir so if an estimate of the probability of independent infection is biased and ir 0 5 route specific probabilities of infection involving ir will have a greater percent bias than route specific probabilities of infection not involving ir route specific probabilities of infection involving ir will have a smaller percent bias than route specific probabilities of infection not involving ir if ir 0 5 in addition to bias in i3 bias was large for the probability of infection in the first juvenile cohort since there was no process model for which sites without testing records were infected without information about possible exposure of those sites infection had to be inferred with a constant probability in summary the model even with missing test records can accurately identify the transmission routes exposing each cohort site with complete test records the model can generate accurate inference about infection probabilities but with missing test records composite probabilities of infection that account for uncertainty in operating transmission routes must be computed for cohort sites the magnitudes of the probabilities of independent infection affect how biased inference about route specific infection probabilities will be see table 4 results from the simulations indicated that when the model is applied to real data inference about which transmission routes have exposed cohort sites should be accurate however the probability of infection given exposure by adults p3 has a slight positive bias and the probability of infection given exposure within a site p1 or by upstream juveniles p2 has a slight negative bias table 7 also the bci may be too precise to have a 95 probability of including the parameter for many route specific probabilities of infection table 7 4 2 lower columbia river sub region exposure via the movement of adult fish is an important route for infection of juvenile fish with ihnv in the lcr sub region forty one percent of the lcr cohort sites were exposed by infectious adults alone r3 only and another 34 were exposed by some combination of exposure by adults as well as exposure within a site r1 or by upstream juveniles r2 only 1 of cohort sites were exposed only within a site r1 only no cohort sites were exposed by upstream juveniles but not adults r2 alone or r12 although only 1 of cohort sites experienced self exposure r1 alone this transmission route had the greatest probability of infection it is expected that at least 22 of the within site r1 exposure opportunities resulted in infection this infection rate may be greater given the expected bias in infection probabilities as indicated in the simulation study the model estimated that infection following exposure via adults with or without self exposure r3 only or r13 in the lcr sub region was also relatively high at 16 or 17 respectively although the true estimate is likely lower than this due to expected bias in infection probabilities when there are missing data there are spatially distinct patterns in which transmission route is most frequent at each site fig 7 for example sites near the mainstem seemed to be exposed by both upstream juveniles and adults r23 frequently fig 7 purple dots sites just upstream of dams and near headwaters seemed to not be exposed often fig 7 black dots the sites with lower mean composite probabilities of infection were also near headwaters and just upstream of the lowest mainstem dam fig 8 only two sites were most frequently exposed by adults and self exposed r13 table a2 and yellow circles in fig 7 the site further from the mainstem was positive in six out of the nine tested juvenile cohorts and the site closer to the mainstem was positive in eight out of the eleven tested juvenile cohorts and has been theorized as playing a substantial role in regional transmission breyta et al 2016a the sites with the highest mean composite probabilities of infection were these two sites that were frequently exposed by adults and self r13 and three sites exposed by both adults and upstream juveniles r23 all downstream of the lowest mainstem dam for each transmission route inferred except r1 there were cohort sites with ihnv positive tests ihnv negative tests and unknown infection statuses all cohort sites with inferred exposure by r1 had testing records two cohort sites were inferred to not be exposed but had ihnv positive tests the discrepancy between the inferred transmission route and the ihnv test result could be due to problems with model inference given incomplete testing data or an additional transmission route that is not represented in our model we suspect the former because many sites that were inferred to not be exposed had positive composite probabilities of infection indicating some model support for exposure fig 6 sites that the model inferred were not exposed generally had low composite probabilities of infection and because of our informative prior cohort sites without testing had low composite probabilities of infection regardless of the route inferred to expose the cohort site to ihnv the patterns that we observed under the basic fish movement assumption held in the other fish movement assumptions in the fish movement assumption where sites within 5 km of the columbia river were functionally on the mainstem there were more sites on the mainstem and there were more sites exposed by r23 table 8 the two sites immediately upstream of the first dam on the columbia river were not on the mainstem in the basic fish movement assumption and inferred to not have been exposed but in the fish movement assumption where sites within 5 km of the columbia river were functionally on the mainstem these sites were on the mainstem and inferred to be exposed by r23 table a2 in the fish movement assumption where upstream sites had to be within 100 km to expose a downstream site we observed fewer cohort sites exposed by r23 and more cohort sites exposed by r3 table 8 two sites that had fewer potential transmitting sites in this fish movement assumption were inferred to have been exposed by r3 compared to r23 in the basic fish movement assumption table a2 it is clear that incomplete testing data has inflated composite probabilities of infection in the model for example cohort sites that were inferred as exposed by r13 had a wide range of composite probabilities of infection many greater than p13 because testing data indicated that other transmission routes were also possible fig 6 the composite probabilities of infection for cohort sites exposed by r13 were often the sum of p1 p3 and p13 for clarity we also note that the ihnv vgs database includes testing records through 2012 but in this analysis we included testing records from 2013 that had been reported by agencies at the time model development began therefore the 2013 testing records used here do not represent all testing performed in 2013 we analyzed the data for the lcr sub region using only the data through 2012 found in the ihnv vgs database and the results were the same as those from including the partial 2013 testing records 4 3 implications our study clearly demonstrates the challenge that incomplete ihnv testing data pose to inference about operating transmission routes and probabilities of infection in particular increased consistency of surveillance testing of adult fish may improve inferential ability for example sites 2 7 10 11 and 16 had low rates of adult testing mean rate of 13 of cohorts tested but potentially expose up to 9 downstream sites in the lcr sub region tests of adult infection 70 adult cohort sites tested were more common than tests of juvenile infection 60 juvenile cohort sites tested but the ihnv positive rate was also greater in adult fish 59 of tested adult cohort sites positive 23 of tested juvenile cohort sites positive fig 2 further the model estimated a relatively high probability of an untested adult cohort being infected 0 26 0 22 0 30 table 6 moreover increasing our understanding about which species are present at different sites across time would refine inference about ihnv transmission dynamics if we could determine that untested cohort sites are missing testing data because there were no fish present to test then we could conclude that these cohort sites could not transmit ihnv or be susceptible to infection instead we currently have to conclude that infection and transmission are possible at these cohort sites but the true infection status is unknown reducing uncertainty in unknown infection states would reduce uncertainty in infection probability estimates implications of increased testing on estimates can be explored through simulations supplementary materials and the feasibility of modifications to testing protocols could be explored with fish health professionals and other stakeholders through a procedure such as structured decision making irwin et al 2008 ferguson et al 2015 determining the operating transmission routes when multiple transmission routes were possible would improve our understanding of transmission dynamics and disease control the viral genotype data offers great potential for identifying operating transmission routes viral genotypes have been very important for studying epidemiological and evolutionary characteristics of ihnv but as used here they are not sufficient to overcome the incomplete ihnv testing data in the lcr sub region genotype data provided support for r1 in one cohort site r2 in one cohort site and r3 in three cohort sites perhaps additional sequencing to differentiate between viruses within dominant genotypes or using the lack of a sequence match i e identification of two different genotypes to eliminate possible transmission routes can increase the utility of genotyping data in future application of the model these options could be explored through simulations as well supplementary materials in future applications of the model to other regions of the columbia river basin we expect more bias and less precision in estimates for regions with lower rates of testing and lower ihnv positive rates compared to the lcr sub region for non wild fish sites in the ihnv vgs database n 324 breyta et al 2017b which includes hatcheries that have a pathogen testing program as well as satellite and unstructured sites like streams and lakes that are tested opportunistically only 36 of years were tested for ihnv in adult fish our results indicate that spawning adult fish appear to play an important role in transmitting ihnv in the lcr sub region these results correlate with case studies showing that infected adults in hatchery water supplies can be responsible for infection of juvenile hatchery fish anderson et al 2000 bendorf et al 2007 breyta et al 2016a b the use of secure water supplies that prevent virus shed by returning adult fish from entering a hatchery is a promising strategy to reduce ihnv transmission to juvenile salmonids at hatcheries while juvenile self infection r1 is rarer when it does happen the probability of infection appears to be greater than with any other transmission route this reinforces the importance of biosecurity protocols at hatcheries our results are consistent with those from previous applications of seir models to investigate transmission of infectious pathogens in fishes previous studies found that there is a significant effect of previous infected cohorts within a farm aldrin et al 2010 fish movement between fisheries has been a driver of epidemics taylor et al 2011 and reducing freshwater transmission is expected to be the most effective single strategy to reduce prevalence of a viral pathogen murray 2006 diseases have different patterns of spread aldrin et al 2010 and seir models have been useful for evaluating potential transmission routes and controls options in a variety of semi wildlife systems conclusions from this exercise along with future simulations utilizing code developed here supplementary materials can direct the use of the bayesian sei model to quantify the relative importance of transmission routes for maintaining virus in other regions as well as in other systems for example this model has potential application to other important bacterial and parasite pathogens of pacific salmon and potentially to other fish rhabdoviruses such as viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus and spring viremia of carp virus which are both listed as globally significant pathogens by the world organization for animal health it is also possible that

25297,we have developed a dynamic epidemiological model informed by records of viral presence and genotypes to evaluate potential transmission routes maintaining a viral pathogen in economically and culturally important anadromous fish populations in the columbia river basin infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus ihnv causes severe disease predominantly in juvenile steelhead trout oncorhynchus mykiss and less frequently in chinook salmon o tshawytscha mortality events following ihnv infection can be devastating for individual hatchery programs despite reports of high local mortality and extensive surveillance efforts there are questions about how viral transmission is maintained modeling this system offers important insights into disease transmission in natural aquatic systems as well as about the data requirements for generating accurate estimates about transmission routes and infection probabilities we simulated six scenarios in which testing rates and the relative importance of different transmission routes varied the simulations demonstrated that the model accurately identified routes of transmission and inferred infection probabilities accurately when there was testing of all cohort sites when testing records were incomplete the model accurately inferred which transmission routes exposed particular cohort sites but generated biased infection probabilities given exposure after validating the model and generating guidelines for result interpretation we applied the model to data from 14 annual cohorts 2000 2013 at 24 focal sites in a sub region of the columbia river basin the lower columbia river lcr to quantify the relative importance of potential transmission routes in this focal sub region we demonstrate that exposure to ihnv via the return migration of adult fish is an important route for maintaining ihnv in the lcr sub region and the probability of infection following this exposure was relatively high at 0 16 although only 1 of cohort sites experienced self exposure by infected juvenile fish this transmission route had the greatest probability of infection 0 22 increased testing and or determining whether transmission can occur from cohort sites without testing records e g determining there was no testing record because there were no fish at the cohort site are expected to improve inference about infection probabilities increased use of secure water supplies and continued use of biosecurity protocols may reduce ihnv transmission from adult fish and juvenile fish within the site respectively to juvenile salmonids at hatcheries models and conclusions from this study are potentially relevant to understanding the relative importance of transmission routes for other important aquatic pathogens in salmonids including the agents of bacterial kidney disease and coldwater disease and the basic approach may be useful for other pathogens and hosts in other geographic regions keywords ihnv salmon steelhead trout transmission viral genotype sei model 1 introduction dynamic models both statistical and mathematical that categorize host populations by susceptible exposed infected recovered seir status have been important tools for describing pathogen transmission although much of the work has focused on human and livestock systems even simple seir models can capture enough of the critical transmission process to inform disease control measures e g anderson and may 1979 1992 bjornstad et al 2002 smith et al 2014 however while all models are limited by the availability and quality of the data to inform and validate parameterization this is a significant challenge in modeling infectious transmission in non human systems where even fundamental estimates of host population size are often uncertain heisey et al 2010 ladeau et al 2011 morris et al 2015 wildlife populations are difficult to access and monitor and consequently infection dynamics are often poorly understood semi wildlife systems with a combination of free ranging animals and husbandry programs at various stages of animals life history such as those associated with salmon oncorhynchus mykiss salmo salar and carp cyprinus carpio have provided some of the most productive application of seir models to investigate transmission of infectious pathogens in non human systems previous studies have evaluated drivers of epidemics likely infection routes effect of distance to an infectious fish farm on transmission and epidemic control options through the use of compartment models and population dependent and independent transmission models e g murray 2006 aldrin et al 2010 taylor et al 2011 in this paper we build on the existing literature to develop and apply a dynamic epidemiological model that categorizes and tracks transitions from susceptible to infected host groups in anadromous fish populations of the columbia river basin the model evaluates the role of potential transmission routes in maintaining a viral pathogen with specific consideration for how missing data influence identification of critical transmission routes infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus ihnv species salmonid novirhabdovirus proliferates in a semi wildlife system with intensive data collection at critical life stages and in this sense represents an important system for making data driven inference about transmission in the wild the model structure and evaluation presented offer important insights into disease transmission in natural aquatic systems as well as about the data requirements for generating accurate inference about transmission routes and infection probabilities once key transmission routes are identified opportunities for surveillance intervention and control can be enhanced archie et al 2009 aldrin et al 2011 the columbia river basin is a large complex watershed that occupies much of the states of washington oregon and idaho as well as smaller portions of other states and two canadian provinces a large number of fish culture facilities hatcheries in the columbia river basin support breeding and juvenile rearing of the predominant wild salmonid species in the watershed including chinook salmon oncorhynchus tshawytscha and steelhead trout oncorhynchus mykiss juvenile hatchery fish are released from freshwater hatcheries to migrate to the ocean where they spend the majority of their lives before returning to freshwater natal sites including hatcheries to breed therefore this is a semi wildlife system where populations of diverse species mix and disperse across a complex landscape aldrin et al 2011 2015 with intense human management and data collection at the beginning and end of the fishes life cycle infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus ihnv species salmonid novirhabdovirus an rna virus of the rhabdovirus family is endemic to the pacific northwest of north america and currently infects a broad range of salmonid species globally bootland and leong 2011 dixon et al 2016 in the columbia river basin ihn disease is predominantly observed in juvenile steelhead and occasionally in chinook salmon bootland and leong 1999 breyta et al 2016a mortality events following ihnv infection at a hatchery can result in the loss of an entire juvenile cohort and can be devastating for individual hatchery programs wolf 1988 lapatra 1998 bootland and leong 1999 spawning adults returning to hatcheries are routinely tested for a suite of pathogens including ihnv but ihnv infection is largely asymptomatic in adult steelhead and chinook thus ihnv infection in adult fish is detected mostly through routine surveillance testing in contrast infection in juvenile fish is most often detected by diagnostic testing of moribund or dead fish with a smaller component of routine surveillance testing throughout the columbia river basin surveillance and diagnostic testing is currently conducted by seven distinct groups in the columbia river basin including federal state and tribal agencies breyta et al 2016a 2017a if a test is negative for ihnv the chance of a false negative is very low because in regions where the virus is routinely detected a sampling method with a lower limit of detection between 5 9 is used in regions where the virus is not routinely detected sampling with a lower detection limit of 1 5 2 is used a lower detection limit of 5 means that if ihnv were present in at least 5 of the fish it would be detected salmonid populations in the columbia river basin are both culturally and economically important due to the extensive programmatic losses and economic costs associated with fish mortality following ihnv infection the molecular and immunological characteristics of the virus have been well documented bootland and leong 2011 genotyping of ihnv isolates has been used for molecular epidemiological studies across the endemic region garver et al 2003 kurath et al 2003 breyta et al 2016a b and globally nishizawa et al 2006 enzmann et al 2010 kurath 2012 viral genotypes isolated from ihnv positive fish at north american hatcheries are defined by sequencing a 303 nucleotide segment of the viral glycoprotein gene called the midg region data are publically available in the meap ihnv database http gis nacse org ihnv the genotyping method detects the majority genotype with a lower limit of detection of minority genotypes around 10 20 for the purpose of studying transmission mechanisms knowing the majority genotype is sufficient because transmission is a bottleneck event i e only a few genomes likely establish a new infection ihn virology testing data collected by each of seven fish health agencies in the columbia river basin from 2000 to 2012 along with available genotyping data have been compiled in a novel database linking fish species fish age class testing location test date test type and test result breyta et al 2017b this database of ihnv virological and genetic surveillance data is referred to hereafter as the ihnv vgs database although ihn disease outbreaks in hatcheries can result in high mortality the spatial and temporal frequency of these events is relatively low with an average of 5 of sites having virus positive juveniles for any given year 10 positive sites per year on average 222 total sites with tested juveniles in the ihnv vgs database breyta et al 2017b access data 3 november 2016 as with many disease systems a persistent challenge is differentiating lack of testing from absence of virus testing across all sites in the ihnv vgs database n 324 for the years 2000 2013 occurred at rates of 22 of site years for juvenile fish 27 of site years with diagnostic tests 57 with surveillance tests and 29 with unknown test type because some site years had multiple test types and 36 of site years for adult fish 9 of site years with diagnostic tests 58 with surveillance tests and 44 with unknown test type because some site years had multiple test types positive ihnv results occurred in 14 of tested site years for juveniles and 25 of tested site years for adults controlling viral outbreaks relies on specific understanding of how ihnv is maintained in the environment at local regional and landscape scales while biosecurity protocols at hatcheries are intended to eliminate parent to offspring transmission and cross contamination between fish cohorts inadvertent transmission among hatchery juveniles and transmission by water borne virus entering a hatchery from non secure water sources are possible mulcahy and bauersfeld 1983 mulcahy et al 1983 mulcahy and pascho 1985 bootland and leong 1999 winton 1991 anderson et al 2000 bendorf et al 2007 tompkins et al 2011 breyta et al 2016b it is also possible that juvenile fish that survive clinical ihn disease or were sub clinically infected might be released from hatcheries while still harboring and possibly shedding infectious virus finally asymptomatic adult fish are frequently recorded with high titers of infectious virus at the time of spawning mulcahy et al 1982 bootland and leong 1999 it is not clear whether adult infection is the result of virus acquired during return migration or life long persistence of virus in a small proportion of fish that survive infection as juveniles possibly with virus reactivated in response to stress or reduced immune function at spawning bootland and leong 2011 as described by breyta et al 2017a three transmission routes are potentially responsible for disease in juvenile hatchery fish transmission that occurs r1 between juvenile cohorts within a site r2 from juveniles reared at upstream sites that shed virus into effluent that passes a downstream site or that shed virus as they pass a site during downstream migration or r3 from infectious virus shed by adults returning to the site or passing a site as they swim upstream table 1 and fig 1 while breyta et al 2017a tested these three potential routes of ihnv transmission using a descriptive analysis ecological modeling can best integrate information about spatial testing ihnv positive cohorts and viral genotypes to evaluate support for specific transmission routes at the landscape scale here we first present a simulation analysis of a sei model developed to evaluate viral transmission among salmonid populations throughout the columbia river basin we use the simulation analysis to rigorously evaluate how missing data influence the model s ability to generate accurate estimates about transmission routes and infection probabilities in this semi wild landscape second we demonstrate our first model application using data from 14 cohorts years 2000 2013 at 24 sites located in the lower columbia river lcr this sub region was chosen for a first assessment of model performance because both testing and juvenile infection rates were relatively high at these sites during this period 60 juvenile cohort sites tested 23 of tested juvenile cohort sites positive 70 adult cohort sites tested 59 of tested adult cohort sites positive fig 2 we interpret model results from the lcr sub region in light of conclusions from the simulations to clarify the relative importance of ihnv transmission routes in the lcr sub region and discuss implications for the management of hatcheries 2 methods we developed a dynamic susceptible exposed infected sei model the ihnv tg3r testing genotyping three route model that is informed by testing and genotyping data to identify the transmission route by which sites were exposed to ihnv and estimate infection probabilities given that transmission route pr for transmission route r fig 3 the model is implemented in a bayesian statistical framework where unknown parameters are defined by probability distributions link and barker 2010 simulations were used to validate and characterize the performance of the model under a range of parameter combinations that represented different biological scenarios the simulations were also used to highlight the effects of missing data on the accuracy of results after validating the model and generating guidelines for result interpretation we applied the model to data from the lcr to quantify the relative importance of potential transmission routes in this focal sub region data available in the ihnv vgs database breyta et al 2017b for the 24 focal sites in the lcr sub region include the date of testing the site coordinates where each cohort was tested species and age class juvenile or adult of fish tested whether tests were positive or negative for ihnv and viral genotype for a subset of positive records for the purposes of model validation and initial conclusions we have combined data across all fish species tested in the lcr sub region this includes the predominant species in the ihnv vgs database steelhead trout anadromous oncorhynchus mykiss 47 of tested cohort sites 74 of ihnv positive juvenile cohort sites and chinook salmon o tshawytscha 59 of tested cohort sites 17 of ihnv positive juvenile cohort sites as well as rainbow trout freshwater o mykiss sockeye salmon anadromous o nerka kokanee salmon freshwater o nerka coho salmon o kisutch and seven non focal hosts that collectively comprise less than 5 of the records in the database breyta et al 2017a within our focal lcr sub region testing of steelhead chinook and other species were equally frequent across cohort sites table 2 however juvenile steelhead tested positive for ihnv at the highest rate testing and positive tests were more frequent for adult fish compared to juvenile fish table 2 when discussing rates of testing in particular species specific rates it is important to consider that the ihnv vgs database does not include information about the species that were present at specific sites across time the database only has testing records so we do not know when a species was present but not tested consequently the testing rates presented here may be underestimated in the next sub sections we first define the model and then describe how we tested the model with simulated data finally we explain how the model and data from the lcr sub region were used to quantify ihnv transmission dynamics within that sub region 2 1 model structure 2 1 1 age classes and cohorts we focused on modeling infection at juvenile life stages because this is when ihn disease causes the greatest mortality in columbia river basin fishes the model estimates the probability that juvenile fish at a particular site were infected during a given cohort defined as all juvenile fish tested from june 1 may 31 these dates were used to define a juvenile cohort because a juvenile class is typically reared from summer spring depending on the species and most juvenile testing occurs in late winter or early spring table a1 fig a1 an adult cohort was defined as all adult fish tested at a site from august 1 july 31 adult fishes are typically at a freshwater site from early fall to late spring and most adult testing occurs in the fall or winter table a1 fig a2 we use the term cohort site to refer to a particular site i e 1 of the 24 focal sites in the lcr sub region during a particular cohort i e 1 of the 14 cohorts from 2000 to 2013 there are then 336 24 focal sites 14 fish cohorts potential cohort sites in our model 2 1 2 possible transmission routes the possible transmission routes fig 1 table 1 modeled were r1 between consecutive juvenile cohorts at site i r2 from juveniles being reared at or migrating downstream from a site j located upstream from site i and r3 from adults returning to site i or any upstream site j table 1 fig 1 these can be considered three independent transmission routes that may occur alone or in combination when considered in combination there are seven possible transmission routes r1 only r2 only r3 only r1 and r2 abbreviated r12 r1 and r3 abbreviated r13 r2 and r3 abbreviated r23 and r1 and r2 and r3 abbreviated r123 an eighth exposure class was also possible where a cohort site was not exposed to ihnv 2 1 3 probabilities of infection for juvenile cohort sites for the first cohort of juveniles t 1 at each site it was not possible to infer which transmission routes exposed the cohort because there was no information identifying which cohort sites were previously infectious therefore the infection process for the first cohort was modeled as a bernoulli trial with a constant probability of infection we also assumed a constant probability of infection for adults at all sites in all cohorts in other words the model used data identifying when cohort sites were tested and which were infected but the infection process was modeled as a bernoulli trial with a constant probability of infection for juvenile cohorts where t 1 the model first determined which transmission routes were possible and then estimated route specific probabilities of infection pr for each cohort site table 1 fig 3 for the first step we assumed that exposure by r1 was possible at site i in cohort t if it had a positive juvenile test in the previous cohort t 1 we assumed that r2 was possible if any upstream site among the 24 focal sites j had a positive juvenile test in the same or previous cohort t or t 1 and we assumed that r3 was possible if there was a positive adult test in the same or previous cohort t or t 1 at the site or any upstream site i or j upstream sites j were defined as any sites among the 24 focal sites in the lcr sub region from which effluent water flowed past site i and all sites 1 km from the mainstem were considered to functionally be on the mainstem after the possible transmission routes were determined for cohort t site i we calculated the associated probability of infection given possible exposure pr to model probabilities of infection that were dependent on the transmission routes we used three structural parameters that each represented the probability of infection for one route independent of the other two routes ir for transmission route r the probabilities of the seven possible transmission routes were computed by multiplying the independent probabilities of infection or their complements for example p3 1 i1 1 i2 i3 meaning that the probability of infection given exposure by r3 is the product of the probability of independent infection by r3 infection by r3 was possible and the compliments of the probabilities of independent infection by r1 or r2 infection by r1 or r2 were not possible if only one transmission route was possible for a given cohort site the composite probability of infection for cohort t site i ct i was equal to that route s probability of infection if multiple transmission routes were possible the composite probability of infection for cohort t site i was equal to the sum of the probabilities associated with the possible routes i e composite probability of infection if r1 only and r12 were possible p1 p12 in the simulated scenarios the independent probabilities of infection were chosen so that the maximum composite probability of infection was similar across each simulated scenario table 3 the maximum composite probability of infection was the sum of the route specific probabilities for all 7 possible routes which are comprised of all possible combinations of r1 r2 and r3 2 1 4 genotype support for transmission routes we used the viral genotypes in the ihnv vgs database breyta et al 2017b which were available for a subset of positive ihnv tests to help discriminate among possible transmission routes viral genotypes were available for 78 of ihnv positive juvenile cohort sites and 68 of ihnv positive adult cohort sites in the lcr sub region once possible transmission routes were defined in the model we further determined which of the possible routes were most likely based on comparing genotypes between infected and potentially transmitting sites for the current model we only considered genotypes that were identical to be informative matches for example if the model determined that r1 only r2 only and r12 were possible in the absence of genotype data the composite probability of infection for the cohort site ct i would be equal to the sum of the three route specific probabilities of infection pr if however there was genotype support for r1 exposure by r2 only would be rejected and the composite probability of infection for the cohort site would be equal to p1 p12 if there was genotype support for both r1 and r2 and there were different genotypes for the two routes meaning two genotypes were detected at cohort t site i and one genotype was detected at site i in the previous cohort t 1 providing support for r1 while the other genotype was detected in a juvenile at an upstream site j in cohort t providing support for r2 exposure by r1 only would be rejected leaving r12 as the only possible transmission route however if there was genotype support for both r1 and r2 and they had the same genotype there was no evidence supporting one route over the other so inferentially this was equivalent to having no genotype data once the set of possible transmission routes for a cohort site were determined infection was modeled as the outcome of a bernoulli trial with the composite probability of infection 2 1 5 missing data and informative priors in our model inference is based primarily on patterns in positive and negative tests for ihnv inference about the role of possible transmission routes and the probabilities of infection associated with transmission routes can be impaired by having many cohort sites with an unknown infection status for example if the model is determining which routes could have exposed cohort t site i to ihnv but it is not known whether juveniles at an upstream site j were infected there is uncertainty in whether r2 could have led to exposure which translates to uncertainty in the composite probability of infection for the cohort site if a cohort site was not tested for ihnv 40 of juvenile cohort sites and 30 of adult cohort sites in the lcr sub region it is unclear whether the absence of a test occurred because the site had no evidence of disease this is particularly likely for juvenile fish that are often tested only if disease is suspected no fish were reared during that cohort or the agency conducting testing did not report test results for any other reason fig 2 without knowing why there was no test the model attempts to infer the unknown infection status based on the informative prior discussed below we used informative priors for 1 the probability that a juvenile cohort site was infected when there was no testing and 2 the probability that an adult cohort site was infected when there was no testing we expect these probabilities to approximate the positive rate in surveillance tests since surveillance testing is designed to be routine and independent of the infection state we assumed infection rates observed from these tests were representative of infection rates at untested cohort sites more details are presented below as they apply to the simulation analysis and lcr sub region data 2 1 6 inference the model operated by looping through cohorts and sites see supplementary materials code lines 71 72 for a given cohort site the ihn virology testing data from that site and any upstream sites were checked code lines 73 94 if there was a positive test from a juvenile fish at that site in the previous cohort exposure by r1 between juvenile cohorts within a site was considered possible if there was a positive test from a juvenile fish at any upstream site in the previous or current cohort exposure by r2 virus shed by juveniles that pass a site either in effluent or as the infected juveniles migrate downstream was considered possible if there was a positive test from an adult fish at the site or any upstream site in the previous or current cohort exposure by r3 virus shed by adults returning to the site or passing the site as they swim upstream was considered possible when sites were examined for possible transmission routes any possible source of transmission resulted in the relevant transmission route being deemed possible the number of possible sources of transmission did not affect the chance of exposure or infection for example if there was 1 upstream site with a positive test from a juvenile fish transmission by r2 was considered possible likewise if there were 5 upstream sites with positive tests from juvenile fish transmission by r2 was deemed possible and the probability of infection associated with exposure by r2 was the same whether there was 1 or 5 infected sites upstream we structured the model this way because testing records in the ihnv vgs database do not indicate the abundance of fish at a cohort site also the current model did not incorporate distance between sites into a calculation of exposure or infection probability but work on this model extension is ongoing next the viral genotyping data were examined to identify transmission routes with genotype support based on identical genotype matches see genotype support for transmission routes section above and transition from s to e compartments in fig 3 after the set of possible transmission routes was compiled for the cohort site a composite probability of infection was calculated see probabilities of infection for juvenile cohort sites section above code lines 96 156 the observed infection status was modeled as the outcome of a bernoulli trial with a probability of success equal to the composite probability of infection if the infection status was unknown it was inferred and modeled as the outcome of a bernoulli trial with a probability of success equal to an informative prior see missing data and informative priors section above transition from e to i compartments in fig 3 and code lines 161 163 the known values entered in the model were 1 cohort sites with juvenile or adult testing 2 cohort sites with positive juvenile or adult tests 3 cohort sites with genotype support for r1 r2 or r3 and 4 a matrix of the sites upstream of each site posterior distributions were approximated for the probability of independent infection for each of the three transmission routes i1 i2 i3 the probability of infection for juveniles in the first cohort co1 the probability of infection for an untested juvenile cohort site the probability of infection for an untested adult cohort site and the probability of infection for a tested adult cohort site we used vague uniform 0 1 priors except for the informative priors as defined below code lines 27 33 we ran models in openbugs 3 2 3 lunn et al 2009 using the r2openbugs package and r 3 2 2 r core team 2013 sturtz et al 2005 we ran three markov chain monte carlo mcmc chains with 75 000 iterations a burn in of 45 000 and thinning of 1 convergence was assessed with the gelman rubin potential scale reduction factor r hat and chains were considered converged if r hat 1 04 for all parameters brooks and gelman 1998 gelman and shirley 2011 after convergence we obtained the mean of parameters posterior distributions and 95 bayesian credible intervals bci 2 2 simulated data 2 2 1 scenarios we conducted simulation analyses to evaluate how missing data influenced the model s ability to generate accurate estimates about transmission routes and infection probabilities we ran 50 simulations of each of six scenarios defined to capture different combinations of data availability and predominant transmission routes table 3 we used the ihnv vgs database breyta et al 2017b to inform the simulations so four of the scenarios had incomplete testing approximately 60 of juvenile cohort sites tested based on 200 tested juvenile cohort sites in the lcr sub region 336 possible juvenile cohort sites in the lcr fig 2 and either a high probability of independent infection for one of the transmission routes or equal independent probabilities of infection for the 3 transmission routes one scenario had testing of all cohort sites and the last simulated scenario was based on the posterior distributions from the model fit to the real lcr sub region data we simulated a scenario to represent the results from the model fit to real data from the lcr sub region to generate additional insights into model performance and assist with interpretation of model results the order of sites i e which sites were upstream j from each site i and the genotype data from the lcr sub region sites were used in all simulated scenarios data regarding which cohort sites were tested and which tested sites were ihnv positive were simulated 2 2 2 missing data and informative priors since many cohort sites in the lcr sub region did not have ihnv testing data the model was designed to infer the unknown infection status which affected the determination of possible transmission routes and composite infection probabilities for subsequent cohort sites in the application with real data from the lcr sub region we based the informative prior on the positive rate from surveillance tests because whether a cohort site has a surveillance test should be independent of the infection state in the simulation analysis we simulated low rates of infection at untested cohort sites and used informative priors when fitting the model because the positive rate from real surveillance tests tended to be low 0 7 for juveniles in the lcr sub region 1 positive test out of 138 surveillance tests and 1 9 for juveniles across all sites in the ihnv vgs database 15 positive tests out of 788 surveillance tests breyta et al 2017b to represent different probabilities of infection depending on whether cohort sites were tested it was expedient to simulate different probabilities of testing depending on whether a cohort site was infected but it amounts to the same pattern if there was simulated infection of juveniles or adults at a cohort site i e the true infection status that is a latent variable in the estimating model the probability of testing was 0 98 otherwise it was 0 6 table 3 the mean probability of adult infection given no test was 0 0408 this was calculated as the probability of not testing a cohort site with infected adults 0 5 0 02 divided by the sum of the probability of not testing a cohort site with infected adults and the probability of not testing a cohort site with uninfected adults 0 5 0 4 where 0 5 is the probability of adult infection table 3 similarly the mean probability of adult infection given a test was 0 62 this was calculated as the probability of testing a cohort site with infected adults 0 5 0 98 divided by the sum of the probability of testing a cohort site with infected adults and the probability of testing a cohort site with uninfected adults 0 5 0 6 therefore in the estimating model we used a beta 486 prior which has a mean of 0 04 and sd of 0 02 for the probability of adult infection given no test and a beta 14 589 prior which has a mean of 0 62 and sd of 0 03 for the probability of adult infection given a test the mean probability of juvenile infection given no test was 0 007 this was calculated as the probability of not testing a cohort site with infected juveniles 0 13 0 02 divided by the sum of the probability of not testing a cohort site with infected juveniles and the probability of not testing a cohort site with uninfected juveniles 0 87 0 4 the mean probability of infection 0 13 was calculated from one run of simulated infections and is consistent with rates observed in the ihnv vgs database 11 infection among all cohort sites 23 infection among lcr cohort sites breyta et al 2017b in the estimating model we used a beta 3182 prior which has a mean of 0 02 and sd of 0 01 for the probability of infection given no test the probability of infection given a test was dependent on the possible transmission routes for the cohort site as described above 2 2 3 model validation by using simulations we were able to compare parameter posterior distributions to those values used to simulate data thereby evaluating the performance of our transmission model under different testing and infection scenarios for each simulated scenario we determined the bias of posterior distribution means posterior mean value used to simulate data the mean width of parameters 95 bcis and the proportion of simulations where the true value of a parameter was outside the 95 bci we also computed the mean proportion of cohort sites that were possibly infected by each of the transmission routes and we determined the proportion of cohort sites where the inferred transmission route did not match the true transmission route in the simulated scenario meant to represent sites in the lcr sub region we also evaluated posterior probabilities of infection given exposure by each of the seven possible transmission routes pr 2 3 data from the lower columbia river sub region after evaluating the model with simulated data we fit the model to real data this procedure allowed for the interpretation of results from real data with a better understanding of how incomplete testing influences inference about infection probabilities and the relative importance of ihnv transmission routes we used data from all species tested at the 24 lcr sub region sites from 2000 to 2013 where an age class juvenile or adult and cohort based on testing date could be determined data regarding which cohort sites were tested which tested sites were ihnv positive viral genotypes and the order of sites were obtained from the ihnv vgs database breyta et al 2017b to generate the informative prior for the probability that an untested adult cohort site was infected we calculated that the positive rate from surveillance tests was 0 26 164 tests with 42 positive therefore we used a beta 122 354 prior which has a mean of 0 26 and sd of 0 02 we used a vague uniform 0 1 prior for the probability of infection of a tested adult cohort site the positive rate from juvenile surveillance tests was 0 007 138 surveillance tests with 1 positive so we used a beta 0 5 68 prior which has a mean of 0 007 and sd of 0 01 for the probability that an untested juvenile cohort site was infected we report the posterior mean and 95 bci for structural parameters and the probability of infection for each of the seven possible transmission routes pr and we determined the transmission routes that possibly exposed each cohort site we interpret these results in light of conclusions from the simulations for a sensitivity analysis we relaxed the assumptions about fish movement in two ways and refit the model to the data from the 24 focal sites in the lcr sub region first we assumed that upstream sites further than 100 km from a site could not expose the downstream site this could occur if adult fish returning to a distant upstream site do not spend much time by a faraway downstream site and or if effluent from distant upstream sites is diluted to below an infectious dose during travel to faraway downstream sites second we assumed that sites on tributaries within 5 km of the mainstem of the columbia river were functionally on the mainstem this could happen if fish take side trips up tributaries during their path farther upstream in the case of adults or to the ocean in the case of juveniles suppose a site x was on a tributary 4 km from the mainstem of the columbia river and there was a site y upstream on the mainstem with site x functionally on the main steam site y is now considered upstream of site x so an infectious adult fish swimming upstream to site y could now expose site x these fish movement assumptions affect the determination of which transmission routes could expose a cohort site 3 results 3 1 simulated data for each scenario we evaluated how the model performed in terms of 1 identifying the operating transmission route and 2 the probability of infection given exposure by a particular route in all simulated scenarios the model was very successful at identifying the transmission route that exposed cohort sites the frequency of misidentifying the transmission route exposing a cohort site to ihnv was very low in all simulated scenarios fig 4 in the scenario with complete testing of all cohort sites our model accurately estimated each parameter table 4 however in simulations with incomplete testing of cohort sites posterior estimates for parameters were largely unbiased with the exception of the probability of infectious transmission from adult fish i3 and probability of juvenile infection in the first cohort which were biased high in all simulated parameter combinations table 4 bias was greatest in the scenario with a high probability of infection from juvenile migrants i2 and lowest in the scenario with a high probability of infection by adults i3 table 4 by considering where the value used to simulate data fell within the posterior distribution we found that the proportion of simulations where the true value of the probability of infectious transmission from adult fish was outside the 95 bci was greatest when there was a high probability of infection by adults and only below 0 2 when there was a high probability of infection from r1 or complete testing fig 4 the width of the 95 bci is related to the measures of bias since with a less precise i e wider bci there is a smaller chance the true value of the parameter will not be contained within the bci in general bcis were least precise in the r2 high scenario and most precise in the r3 high scenario the r1 high scenario had the lowest frequency of the true probability of independent infection by r3 falling outside the bci and a less precise bci 0 48 width for this parameter table 5 fig 4 in the r2 high scenario the probability of independent infection by r3 was most biased and had its least precise bci also the bci for the probability of independent infection by r1 was its least precise tables 4 and 5 in the r3 high scenario the probability of independent infection by r3 was least biased had its most precise bci and had its highest frequency of the true value falling outside the bci also the bci for the probability of independent infection by r2 was its most precise tables 4 and 5 fig 4 among the three probabilities of independent infection infection by r3 had the least precise bci in all simulated scenarios except in the r3 high scenarios in which the three bcis had similar precisions but infection by r1 had the least precise bci table 5 3 2 data from the lower columbia river sub region the model fit to real data from 336 cohort sites in the lcr sub region inferred that exposure by infectious adult fish r3 occurred most frequently 41 of cohort sites and exposure within a site r1 occurred at 1 of cohort sites fig 5 infectious transmission by adults or upstream juveniles together r23 was a frequent result r23 21 of cohort sites fig 5 the probability of infection following exposure was greatest when exposure occurred between juvenile cohorts within a site r1 and secondarily by r3 table 6 there were relatively large posterior probabilities of infection given exposure by r1 only p1 0 22 r3 only p3 0 16 and r13 p13 0 17 table 6 the composite probability of infection was greatest when the model inferred exposure by r123 fig 6 in this case the testing data indicated that all transmission routes were possible and there was not genotype data that could eliminate some potential routes therefore the composite probability of infection was equal to the sum of all seven route specific probabilities genotype data helped resolve potential transmission routes in four out of the 36 juvenile cohort sites in the lcr sub region that had genotype data for example in two cohort sites r1 only r3 only and r13 were possible based on positive negative test results but genotype data eliminated r1 only the composite probability of infection for these cohort sites was 0 33 but would have been 0 56 without the evidence from the genotype data when we examined inferred transmission routes at specific sites across the landscape r3 was a component of the most frequent transmission route for all exposed sites fig 7 table a2 most sites were frequently exposed by r3 only 11 of 24 focal sites and only two sites were frequently exposed by r13 fig 7 there was a high degree of variation among cohorts in the transmission route operating at a site for example the site frequently exposed by r13 with an upstream site site 15 in table a2 was exposed by r13 in 8 cohorts but exposed by r3 in 4 cohorts and not exposed in 1 cohort most sites were exposed by 3 transmission routes over the 13 cohorts table a2 all but three sites had variable exposure among the 13 cohorts table a2 the model inferred that 3 sites on tributaries with no upstream sites were never exposed in the 13 cohorts two of those sites are upstream of the first dam on the columbia river sites that were not frequently exposed had the lowest mean composite probability of infection across time and the sites that were frequently exposed by r13 had some of the highest mean composite probabilities of infection figs 7 and 8 bci widths were comparable to those in simulated scenarios table 5 3 3 simulation representing lower columbia river sites based on results from the lcr sites we ran another simulation fit to data generated with high probabilities of independent infection by r1 and r3 table 3 represent lcr in this lcr defined scenario two transmission routes were associated with relatively high probabilities of infection whereas in the five simulated scenarios defined a priori and described above only one transmission route had a high probability of infection or all transmission routes had equal probabilities of infection most cohort sites in this scenario were exposed by r3 only but there was also a relatively high proportion of cohort sites exposed by r13 r23 and r123 fig 5 mean bias in the probability of independent infection by r3 was the same as in the equal scenario and r1 high scenario and only the r3 high scenario had a lower mean bias table 4 the true value of the probability of independent infection by r3 was outside the 95 bci in over half of the simulations at a rate similar to the equal scenario fig 4 the probability of infection given exposure by r1 only p1 was most biased low and the probabilities of infection given exposure by r3 only and r13 were most biased high table 7 also the bci was widest for these probabilities the probabilities of infection given exposure by r23 or r123 were most accurate the frequency of the true value falling outside the bci was greatest for the probability of infection given exposure by r12 and was only low for the probability of infection given exposure by r23 or r123 table 7 the sensitivity analysis in which we modified assumptions about fish movement in two ways indicated that results for the lcr sub region were robust tables 6 and 8 under all fish movement assumptions parameter posterior distributions were very similar table 6 there were slight variations in the number of cohort sites exposed by r3 r23 or not exposed table 8 4 discussion we developed a model to evaluate how different transmission routes cause infection in juvenile salmonids the model generates two general types of results 1 identification of which transmission route s likely exposed each juvenile cohort site and 2 the probability of infection associated with each transmission route when the infection status for each cohort site is not known from testing data there is uncertainty in which transmission route s likely exposed each cohort site and consequently uncertainty in the probability of infection for each cohort site therefore the model infers a composite probability of infection for each juvenile cohort site that is a function of 1 the probability of infection associated with each transmission route and 2 the set of transmission routes that may have exposed each juvenile cohort site through simulated scenarios we conducted a thorough evaluation of model performance including characterizing the influence of incomplete testing and variable infectivity among potential transmission routes model performance was assessed in terms of the accuracy and precision of posterior distributions compared to known values used to simulate data to which models were fit a good bayesian model should generate accurate and precise posterior distributions accuracy is assessed by measuring how close the mean of the posterior distribution is to the true value used to simulate data in an unbiased model the posterior mean should equal the true value in a more biased less accurate model the posterior mean will be less similar to the true value in a precise posterior distribution the 95 bci will be narrow indicating little uncertainty in the parameter value also there should be a 0 95 probability that the 95 bci contains the true value after discussing model performance we examine how inference from real data can be interpreted more accurately we also consider how the model can inform hatchery management and be applied to other systems 4 1 simulations our simulation protocol demonstrated that the model structure accurately identified operating routes of transmission and inferred infection probabilities when there was testing of all cohort sites even when testing records were incomplete the model accurately inferred which transmission routes were exposing particular cohort sites but the probability that a cohort was infected given exposure was biased this bias was most evident in estimating probabilities of infection i3 associated with exposure by infectious adults r3 we expect that the probability of independent infection i3 by adults r3 was the most biased parameter for two reasons first there was a relatively high probability of missing an adult infection when a cohort site was not tested 0 26 0 22 0 30 bci compared to 0 03 0 02 0 08 bci for missing a juvenile infection table 6 recall that we used informative priors for the probability that a juvenile or adult cohort site was infected when there was no testing the prior distributions were based on the ihnv positive rates from surveillance tests 0 26 for adults 0 007 for juveniles that are conducted routinely when there are no signs of disease second our model inferred that cohort sites were frequently exposed by infectious adults because it is likely that many untested cohort sites had infected adults but which cohort sites is unknown fig 2 and exposure by infectious adults was a likely explanation for the observed pattern of ihnv infection the model s ability to infer the probability of infection given exposure by adults was impaired the probability of independent infection by adults i3 was most biased in the scenario with a high probability of infection given exposure by upstream juveniles r2 and least biased in the scenario with a high probability of infection given exposure by infectious adults r3 this pattern may be due to two outcomes first exposure within a site r1 and by upstream juveniles r2 were relatively frequent in the scenario with a high probability of infection given exposure by infectious adults r3 and rare in the scenario with a high probability of infection given exposure by upstream juveniles r2 this meant the probabilities of independent infection within a site i1 or by upstream juveniles i2 were inferred based on data from many cohort sites second the composite probabilities of infection were relatively large in the scenario with a high probability of infection given exposure by infectious adults r3 because there often was support for exposure at a cohort site by multiple transmission routes because there was dependence between independent probabilities of infection ir and route specific probabilities of infection pr having data from many cohort sites to infer probabilities of infection in the scenario with a high probability of infection given exposure by infectious adults r3 resulted in relatively accurate inference in the scenario with a high probability of infection given exposure by infectious adults r3 exposure of cohort sites by only infectious adults r3 only infectious adults and within site virus r13 and infectious adults upstream infectious juveniles and within site virus r123 had similar frequencies so many cohort sites had composite probabilities of infection with a large magnitude that were a function of i3 as well as i1 and i2 this contributed to less uncertainty about i3 however in the scenario with a high probability of infection given exposure by upstream juveniles r2 cohort sites were exposed by only infectious adults r3 only much more frequently than by the other routes and composite probabilities of infection were smaller making accurate inference about ir difficult in a related pattern simulated scenarios r3 high equal representing lcr where exposure by r3 only r13 and r123 had high frequencies were also characterized by a narrow bci for i3 and because of that a high frequency of the posterior mean for i3 falling outside the bci fig 4 table 5 with the probability of independent infection by adults i3 being consistently overestimated when there were missing tests patterns of bias in route specific probabilities of infection pr could be expected namely overestimation could be expected for route specific probabilities of infection involving exposure by adults p3 p13 p23 p123 and underestimation could be expected for route specific probabilities of infection not involving exposure by adults p1 p2 p12 this conclusion follows from the equations used to calculate route specific probabilities of infection for example if i3 is over estimated p3 is expected to be overestimated because p3 1 i1 1 i2 i3 as demonstrated by results in tables 4 and 6 we can define general equations to quantify percent bias in route specific probabilities of infection when a probability of independent infection is biased the percent bias for route specific probabilities of infection involving the biased route can be computed as e ir where ir is the true value for the probability of independent infection and e is the magnitude of the bias posterior mean of the overestimated ir true ir similarly the percent bias for route specific probabilities of infection not involving the biased route is equal to e 1 ir so if an estimate of the probability of independent infection is biased and ir 0 5 route specific probabilities of infection involving ir will have a greater percent bias than route specific probabilities of infection not involving ir route specific probabilities of infection involving ir will have a smaller percent bias than route specific probabilities of infection not involving ir if ir 0 5 in addition to bias in i3 bias was large for the probability of infection in the first juvenile cohort since there was no process model for which sites without testing records were infected without information about possible exposure of those sites infection had to be inferred with a constant probability in summary the model even with missing test records can accurately identify the transmission routes exposing each cohort site with complete test records the model can generate accurate inference about infection probabilities but with missing test records composite probabilities of infection that account for uncertainty in operating transmission routes must be computed for cohort sites the magnitudes of the probabilities of independent infection affect how biased inference about route specific infection probabilities will be see table 4 results from the simulations indicated that when the model is applied to real data inference about which transmission routes have exposed cohort sites should be accurate however the probability of infection given exposure by adults p3 has a slight positive bias and the probability of infection given exposure within a site p1 or by upstream juveniles p2 has a slight negative bias table 7 also the bci may be too precise to have a 95 probability of including the parameter for many route specific probabilities of infection table 7 4 2 lower columbia river sub region exposure via the movement of adult fish is an important route for infection of juvenile fish with ihnv in the lcr sub region forty one percent of the lcr cohort sites were exposed by infectious adults alone r3 only and another 34 were exposed by some combination of exposure by adults as well as exposure within a site r1 or by upstream juveniles r2 only 1 of cohort sites were exposed only within a site r1 only no cohort sites were exposed by upstream juveniles but not adults r2 alone or r12 although only 1 of cohort sites experienced self exposure r1 alone this transmission route had the greatest probability of infection it is expected that at least 22 of the within site r1 exposure opportunities resulted in infection this infection rate may be greater given the expected bias in infection probabilities as indicated in the simulation study the model estimated that infection following exposure via adults with or without self exposure r3 only or r13 in the lcr sub region was also relatively high at 16 or 17 respectively although the true estimate is likely lower than this due to expected bias in infection probabilities when there are missing data there are spatially distinct patterns in which transmission route is most frequent at each site fig 7 for example sites near the mainstem seemed to be exposed by both upstream juveniles and adults r23 frequently fig 7 purple dots sites just upstream of dams and near headwaters seemed to not be exposed often fig 7 black dots the sites with lower mean composite probabilities of infection were also near headwaters and just upstream of the lowest mainstem dam fig 8 only two sites were most frequently exposed by adults and self exposed r13 table a2 and yellow circles in fig 7 the site further from the mainstem was positive in six out of the nine tested juvenile cohorts and the site closer to the mainstem was positive in eight out of the eleven tested juvenile cohorts and has been theorized as playing a substantial role in regional transmission breyta et al 2016a the sites with the highest mean composite probabilities of infection were these two sites that were frequently exposed by adults and self r13 and three sites exposed by both adults and upstream juveniles r23 all downstream of the lowest mainstem dam for each transmission route inferred except r1 there were cohort sites with ihnv positive tests ihnv negative tests and unknown infection statuses all cohort sites with inferred exposure by r1 had testing records two cohort sites were inferred to not be exposed but had ihnv positive tests the discrepancy between the inferred transmission route and the ihnv test result could be due to problems with model inference given incomplete testing data or an additional transmission route that is not represented in our model we suspect the former because many sites that were inferred to not be exposed had positive composite probabilities of infection indicating some model support for exposure fig 6 sites that the model inferred were not exposed generally had low composite probabilities of infection and because of our informative prior cohort sites without testing had low composite probabilities of infection regardless of the route inferred to expose the cohort site to ihnv the patterns that we observed under the basic fish movement assumption held in the other fish movement assumptions in the fish movement assumption where sites within 5 km of the columbia river were functionally on the mainstem there were more sites on the mainstem and there were more sites exposed by r23 table 8 the two sites immediately upstream of the first dam on the columbia river were not on the mainstem in the basic fish movement assumption and inferred to not have been exposed but in the fish movement assumption where sites within 5 km of the columbia river were functionally on the mainstem these sites were on the mainstem and inferred to be exposed by r23 table a2 in the fish movement assumption where upstream sites had to be within 100 km to expose a downstream site we observed fewer cohort sites exposed by r23 and more cohort sites exposed by r3 table 8 two sites that had fewer potential transmitting sites in this fish movement assumption were inferred to have been exposed by r3 compared to r23 in the basic fish movement assumption table a2 it is clear that incomplete testing data has inflated composite probabilities of infection in the model for example cohort sites that were inferred as exposed by r13 had a wide range of composite probabilities of infection many greater than p13 because testing data indicated that other transmission routes were also possible fig 6 the composite probabilities of infection for cohort sites exposed by r13 were often the sum of p1 p3 and p13 for clarity we also note that the ihnv vgs database includes testing records through 2012 but in this analysis we included testing records from 2013 that had been reported by agencies at the time model development began therefore the 2013 testing records used here do not represent all testing performed in 2013 we analyzed the data for the lcr sub region using only the data through 2012 found in the ihnv vgs database and the results were the same as those from including the partial 2013 testing records 4 3 implications our study clearly demonstrates the challenge that incomplete ihnv testing data pose to inference about operating transmission routes and probabilities of infection in particular increased consistency of surveillance testing of adult fish may improve inferential ability for example sites 2 7 10 11 and 16 had low rates of adult testing mean rate of 13 of cohorts tested but potentially expose up to 9 downstream sites in the lcr sub region tests of adult infection 70 adult cohort sites tested were more common than tests of juvenile infection 60 juvenile cohort sites tested but the ihnv positive rate was also greater in adult fish 59 of tested adult cohort sites positive 23 of tested juvenile cohort sites positive fig 2 further the model estimated a relatively high probability of an untested adult cohort being infected 0 26 0 22 0 30 table 6 moreover increasing our understanding about which species are present at different sites across time would refine inference about ihnv transmission dynamics if we could determine that untested cohort sites are missing testing data because there were no fish present to test then we could conclude that these cohort sites could not transmit ihnv or be susceptible to infection instead we currently have to conclude that infection and transmission are possible at these cohort sites but the true infection status is unknown reducing uncertainty in unknown infection states would reduce uncertainty in infection probability estimates implications of increased testing on estimates can be explored through simulations supplementary materials and the feasibility of modifications to testing protocols could be explored with fish health professionals and other stakeholders through a procedure such as structured decision making irwin et al 2008 ferguson et al 2015 determining the operating transmission routes when multiple transmission routes were possible would improve our understanding of transmission dynamics and disease control the viral genotype data offers great potential for identifying operating transmission routes viral genotypes have been very important for studying epidemiological and evolutionary characteristics of ihnv but as used here they are not sufficient to overcome the incomplete ihnv testing data in the lcr sub region genotype data provided support for r1 in one cohort site r2 in one cohort site and r3 in three cohort sites perhaps additional sequencing to differentiate between viruses within dominant genotypes or using the lack of a sequence match i e identification of two different genotypes to eliminate possible transmission routes can increase the utility of genotyping data in future application of the model these options could be explored through simulations as well supplementary materials in future applications of the model to other regions of the columbia river basin we expect more bias and less precision in estimates for regions with lower rates of testing and lower ihnv positive rates compared to the lcr sub region for non wild fish sites in the ihnv vgs database n 324 breyta et al 2017b which includes hatcheries that have a pathogen testing program as well as satellite and unstructured sites like streams and lakes that are tested opportunistically only 36 of years were tested for ihnv in adult fish our results indicate that spawning adult fish appear to play an important role in transmitting ihnv in the lcr sub region these results correlate with case studies showing that infected adults in hatchery water supplies can be responsible for infection of juvenile hatchery fish anderson et al 2000 bendorf et al 2007 breyta et al 2016a b the use of secure water supplies that prevent virus shed by returning adult fish from entering a hatchery is a promising strategy to reduce ihnv transmission to juvenile salmonids at hatcheries while juvenile self infection r1 is rarer when it does happen the probability of infection appears to be greater than with any other transmission route this reinforces the importance of biosecurity protocols at hatcheries our results are consistent with those from previous applications of seir models to investigate transmission of infectious pathogens in fishes previous studies found that there is a significant effect of previous infected cohorts within a farm aldrin et al 2010 fish movement between fisheries has been a driver of epidemics taylor et al 2011 and reducing freshwater transmission is expected to be the most effective single strategy to reduce prevalence of a viral pathogen murray 2006 diseases have different patterns of spread aldrin et al 2010 and seir models have been useful for evaluating potential transmission routes and controls options in a variety of semi wildlife systems conclusions from this exercise along with future simulations utilizing code developed here supplementary materials can direct the use of the bayesian sei model to quantify the relative importance of transmission routes for maintaining virus in other regions as well as in other systems for example this model has potential application to other important bacterial and parasite pathogens of pacific salmon and potentially to other fish rhabdoviruses such as viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus and spring viremia of carp virus which are both listed as globally significant pathogens by the world organization for animal health it is also possible that

25298,in the post paris era urban emissions have received worldwide attention as cities are considered to be responsible for most of the world s environmental footprint a better understanding of urban co2 emissions and their related carbon footprints offers benefits to policymakers interested in promoting effective and efficient low carbon solutions in particular a clear determination of direct and indirect emissions inventories that is identification of emissions related to specific sources can provide a valuable baseline for the planning assessing implementing and monitoring of urban mitigation actions focusing on the japanese urban residential sector this paper uses an established urban database and emission database based on global related input output analysis to systematically analyze household carbon footprints related to energy demand targeting both direct and indirect energy related co2 emissions in japan s megacities the results reveal the city specific emissions status of japan s three major metropolitan areas showing for example that tokyo is a source of high direct emissions while utsunomiya is a significant source of indirect emissions the study also tentatively concludes that the depopulation of cities can result in higher per capital emissions both direct and indirect as they relate to energy demand improved sector and spatially explicit information for better mitigation policymaking and environmental education at the urban level is presented valuable insights are offered through an in depth investigation of the relationship between co2 emissions and urban socioeconomic activities benefitting future low carbon city research and practice keywords metropolitan areas household carbon footprints 3eid intercity disparity japan 1 introduction in the post paris era increasing attention is being given to global co2 emissions mitigation with particular focus on the world s cities fujii et al 2016 togawa et al 2014 this urban focus comes as no surprise since cities are considered responsible for a majority of anthropogenic co2 emissions cooper 2016 van de graaf 2017 a better understanding of emissions sources and drivers and the design and impact of countermeasures is necessary to support ongoing efforts to reduce these co2 emissions dong et al 2016b kok et al 2006 cities are the carriers of the intensive socioeconomic metabolism of human beings as well as being responsible for most of the world s environmental footprint dong et al 2016a b with the growth of urban populations over the past several decades cities now accommodate more than half of the world s population and have become a critical sector in energy consumption and energy demand emissions as a consequence urban co2 emissions have emerged as an extremely important consideration in any comprehensive policy aimed at reducing the harmful effects of anthropogenic emissions liang et al 2016a b 2014 sun et al 2017 among the various urban sectors the household sector is critical it accounts for roughly 70 of final consumption expenditures an amount that is expected to increase given the continuing urbanization process and the projected rise in living standards kennedy et al 2009 urban household emissions and inventories are thus attracting increased attention li et al 2015 nässén 2014 pukšec et al 2014 su et al 2017 and are expected to play a major role on the consumer side of co2 reduction polices that urban co2 emissions need to be a crucial part of any mitigation policy discussion is undeniable however compared to the number of studies done on global co2 emissions at the national level andrew et al 2009 jones and kammen 2011 wiedmann 2009b or the regional level brizga et al 2017 liang et al 2007 tian et al 2014 2016 there are still relatively few urban scale studies the need for such studies seems clear particularly those focused on individual city co2 emissions and current intercity disparities feng et al 2014 vandeweghe and kennedy 2007 a systematic analysis of urban co2 emissions and mitigation focused on the household sector offers a solid basis for the design of countermeasures to improve consumption patterns and alleviate some of the more serious negative impacts of climate change ipcc 2014b since urban residential co2 emissions are a critical consideration in any comprehensive co2 mitigation policy identifying urban household patterns of consumption is essential chen et al 2017 geng et al 2017 park et al 2017 urban policymakers clearly need to confront the coming challenge and guide urban residents to cultivate an economical and environmentally friendly lifestyle however without a sufficient understanding of city scale emissions and intercity differences effective mitigation policies will be all but impossible to devise and implement wakiyama and kuramochi 2017 zang et al 2017 household co2 emissions can be assigned to either monetary or physical consumption categories and can be sourced from various sectors e g accommodation transportation and energy among these the household energy related sector stands alone in causing co2 emissions both directly and indirectly jiang 2016 setlhaolo and xia 2016 for example the direct consumption of energy e g petrol gas water and kerosene creates co2 directly in contrast carbon emissions embedded in demand responsive energy production processes are treated as indirect emissions indirect household emissions have been the focus of a number of input output io models it has been demonstrated for example that more than 60 of household emissions are produced in an indirect way in the korean residential sector park and heo 2007 in fact indirect energy consumption energy consumption embedded in the production process and its associated carbon emissions have been found to be greater than direct consumption and emissions in a number of urban household studies feng et al 2011 pointing to the need to include both components when measuring total household contributions sommer and kratena 2017 veeramani et al 2017 in addressing this issue measuring carbon footprints offers a scientific approach to comprehensively assessing carbon emissions associated with human activity kanemoto et al 2016 wiedmann 2009a this approach is used in the present study to capture the full environmental burden that can be linked to the urban residential sector japan continues to make significant efforts to promote low carbon policies fujii et al 2016 togawa et al 2014 as such it offers an ideal laboratory to conduct studies to address the research challenges noted above and to test the feasibility of potential mitigation methods furthermore japan has a large integrated and detailed statistical database and spatial data at the urban and regional levels that strongly support regional decision making regarding low carbon actions togawa et al 2016 in addition as a mature developed country japan s co2 emissions from its residential sector account for a major portion of the country s overall emissions of the total japanese national co2 emissions in 2014 estimated to be 126 5 million tons 19 2 million tons were associated with the residential sector compared to 42 6 million tons from the transportation sector 21 7 million tons from the industrial sector and 26 1 million tons from the commercial sector moreover while emissions from the industrial sector have been decreasing in recent years emissions from the residential sector increased 6 6 between 2005 and 2014 moe 2016 additionally since the great east earthquake in 2011 put tremendous pressure on the energy supply and carbon mitigation countermeasures reducing residential co2 emissions has become a critical topic taken together these factors make japan an ideal testing laboratory and a promising source of enlightening insights into the future of other regions in the world given the above argument the following questions merit consideration in order to better understand urban household emissions in japan 1 what are the trends for household energy demand consumption and emissions in japanese megacities 2 differences between emissions from direct combustion and emissions embedded in related indirect processes 3 what are the relevant emissions patterns and what are the underlying factors e g per capita emissions urban population density and consumption style 4 are there differences in household energy consumption among the various metropolitan areas spatial features answering these questions has important policy implications for the design and implementation of effective local and regional measures to provide answers the present study investigated household energy demand carbon footprints including energy demand co2 emissions generated both directly and indirectly using an advanced io approach and a detailed local database along with relevant statistics we first calculate direct household emissions using the family income and expenditure survey fies together with co2 emission intensities derived from the resource energy statistics of japan we then evaluate indirect residential household co2 emission based on emission intensities derived from 3eid embodied energy and emission intensity data for japan using input output tables and the household consumption inventories in three metropolitan areas in japan the kinki chukyo and shuto areas the source categories including household related features of carbon footprints and intercity disparities are investigated in depth and provide detailed information for future mitigation policy and priority setting importantly the present study presents sectoral and spatially explicit information that will enable more effective mitigation policymaking and environmental education at the urban level the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the methodology to evaluate household co2 emissions in both direct and indirect ways section 3 describes the case study areas section 4 presents analytical results and related discussions section 5 summarizes conclusions and outlines policy implications 2 methods and data 2 1 household co2 emissions on energy demand household energy consumption can be classified as either direct consumption which involves the combustion process or indirect consumption which involves other processes such as energy production and disposal as a general rule the production of goods and services requires the direct use of inputs which in turn use inputs from other sectors at different stages of the industrial process this latter component is called indirect use liu et al 2011 in this study we focus on the unique household need that generates emissions not only directly but also indirectly the household need for energy we compare the two emissions types and identify intercity disparities for purposes of the study energy directly consumed by a household consists of manufactured and piped gas liquefied propane kerosene and gasoline used in combustion when a household consumes combusts one or more of these energy sources direct emissions are generated at the same time households also consume energy in other ways using for example electricity natural gas water and other fuels for lighting and heating although direct utilization of these energy sources does not generate co2 emissions directly their upstream production can be a source of substantial emissions it seems clear that when we focus on emissions associated with the energy related consumption of the residential sector both direct and indirect emissions should be included water is an especially interesting case although most residential energy demand emissions occur both in the production and utilization processes water usage which includes sewage generates emissions during the final disposal process therefore we considered the waste water disposal process as part of the water need emission intensity fig 1 shows the system boundaries of the study 2 2 data compliance for evaluating household energy related co2 emissions as discussed earlier household co2 emissions are embedded in energy consumption both in direct and indirect ways direct household carbon emissions can be calculated based on the various energy sources and their corresponding emission factors converting energy consumption into household direct emissions can be achieved simply by multiplying the emission intensities of each energy source and summing across all sources indirect energy consumption and emissions can be calculated using input output analysis ioa to identify the energy embodied in a unit of production the resulting household consumption measure reflects not only the energy used as direct inputs into the production of each good but also the energy used in the intermediate inputs used in the production of that good and the energy used in the intermediate inputs of those intermediate inputs while direct energy emissions can be deduced from energy consumption data indirect emission intensities are derived from national or regional io tables the above cited 3eid utilizes an io life cycle assessment lca method with a global link input output glio model nansai et al 2012 and can be considered a simplified multi regional input output mrio model that guarantees system boundaries while achieving data management cost reductions shigetomi et al 2014 emission intensities can be used to evaluate indirect emissions associated with the production process here tco2 capita per one million yen tco2 capita m jpy is estimated from the household consumption of these items using a glio model for this study we used per capita consumption in 2005 one year to evaluate the emissions in the following discussion we apply the per capita value to evaluate urban emissions performance since household size varies in japan the monetary inventory for three metropolitan areas is derived from the fies both monetary and non monetary incentives as well as information measures can be used to encourage behavioral changes ipcc 2014a that will reduce household energy demand emissions by multiplying the monetary consumption of households for each energy demand category and summing the products the total emissions generated by cities both in direct and indirect ways can be determined 2 2 1 direct household emission from energy consumption direct emissions are relatively easy to evaluate since physical consumption of direct energy sources can be identified from a household s monetary inventory per household direct co2 emissions from direct energy consumption can be derived by multiplying unit price and net calorific value using household size data from fies allows us to then determine per capita emissions values we first calculated direct household energy consumption using the household s consumption inventory as presented in following equations 1 d h c f k i 1 n e g i i i 2 e g i e c i e p i where d h c f k represents direct carbon emissions from city k i is the energy type such as gasoline or kerosene i i refers to the carbon emissions factor of energy use for energy type i e g i is the energy consumption of energy type i e c i is the household monetary purchase of energy type i and e p i is the average unit price of energy i in this study unit price data were obtained from city prefectural statistics data for 2005 the co2 emission factor for direct combustion can be found in resource and energy statistics of japan for 2005 finally the fies for 2005 gives the monetary value for the household consumption of energy 2 2 2 indirect household energy related emissions household indirect energy consumption and associated co2 emissions can be calculated using a variety of methods we use ioa to identify the emissions embodied in a unit of consumption the 3eid database provides emission intensities that include upstream emissions such as those from energy investment in other sectors the database provides indirect co2 emissions following the entire supply chain nansai et al 2012 shigetomi et al 2014 and can be used freely and easily to evaluate the environmental performance of virtually all consumption items in japan the dataset can be considered a simplified multi regional model that guarantees boundaries for the entire system a total of 406 japanese domestic and imported commodities were used to calculate carbon dioxide emission intensities measured in tco2eq per m jpy 1 usd 112 96 jpy 2017 10 19 the dataset can be combined with household consumption inventories for estimating household emissions by residential monetary input we selected our emission intensities from this database and matched each item with the city level monetary consumption measures from the fies thus city k s indirect carbon footprint can be determined as 3 i h c f k e f i n d c y k where i h c f k is city k s indirect carbon footprint y k is the monetary expenditure on each consumption item and e f i n d c refers to emission intensities derived from the 3eid inventory we derived the household emission intensities of the energy demand items from this dataset thus a city s total carbon footprint can be expressed as 4 h c f k i h c f k d h c f k i 1 n e g i i i e f i n d c y k where h c f k is the total carbon footprint of household k fig 2 shows a flowchart for the data compliance process steps in which fies data were used are indicated by the dotted outlines 3 overview of case study areas with diverse activities and lifestyles cities are among the most complex emissions sources not surprisingly citizen activities are considered a major determinant of a city s climatic impact ishii et al 2010 cities now accommodate more than half of the world s population and urban populations have for several decades been increasing at an accelerated pace rapid economic growth and improvements in city living conditions have brought with them less environmentally friendly lifestyles and increased per capita household emissions given the intense energy and resource demands placed on cities today s cities have an opportunity and obligation to explore a wide array of technology and policy options to increase energy efficiency and reduce per capita consumption and emissions parshall et al 2010 in this regard a comparative analysis of cities based on an investigation of emissions sources and their relationship with various lifestyles has potentially significant value the government of japan recently announced a stronger focus on residential co2 emissions in response to pressures from both energy supply and household dilution as a typical developed country the population of japan reached a peak of 128 8 million people in 2004 and is expected to follow a steadily declining trend at the same time the decline in the number of household members has generated more small scale even single member households such household dilution is not unique to japan smaller households will become the modal household type in the u s underwood and zahran 2015 and most other developed countries household size has been shown to be significantly correlated with co2 emissions underwood and zahran 2015 which suggests that per capita household emissions can be expected to increase with the decline in household size to accomplish emissions reduction targets multiple efforts are expected from officials at both the national and regional levels of government however without a sufficient understanding of the status of emissions locally such reduction policies are unlikely to be implemented effectively and efficiently complicating matters japan s urban household emissions are now in a transition period making the future very difficult to predict given this circumstance local mitigation actions will be crucial in response to this need cities in three specific metropolitan areas having typical and representative urban emission features were selected for study the japanese cities chosen are located in three highly urbanized metropolitan areas known as shuto chukyo and kinki these three areas are considered the central areas of japan in terms of polity economics and culture fig 3 provides a map of the three areas as shown the shuto metropolitan area contains tokyo and seven other prefectural cities saitama mito utsunomiya yokohama chiba kofu and maebashi the metropolitan chukyo area contains nagoya gifu and tsu and the kinki area contains six mega cities osaka kyoto nara otsu kobe and wakayama table 1 provides basic information regarding the targeted metropolitan areas the constituent cities are characterized by high population densities with tokyo and osaka leading the way with a population density exceeding 10 000 people per square kilometer as evidenced by the age data provided here japan is an aging society with a large proportion of senior citizens people above 65 years of age among the selected megacities kofu 22 2 wakayama 22 1 maebashi 20 5 and osaka 20 1 have especially high proportions in each of these cities more than one in five residents is a senior citizen in light of the current demographic situation and future population trends household emission studies involving japan s major metropolitan areas can be assumed to reflect typical japanese emission characteristics however current top down emission reduction approaches do not sufficiently consider regional disparities and emission structures i e emission sources or emission types this issue differentiating energy demand emissions based on emission type and sector at the megacity level is discussed next 4 results and discussion 4 1 total household energy related co2 fig 4 shows total household energy related co2 emissions for the targeted cities as the figure suggests emissions exhibited different characteristics across the three metropolitan areas specifically the average 2005 household emissions per capita for the shuto cities 2 17 tco2 is lower than the average for both the chukyo cities 2 31 tco2 and the kinki cities 2 20 tco2 the maximum emissions value occurs in utsunomiya the capital city of tochigi prefecture the chukyo area co2 emissions average is greater than the averages of the other two metropolitan areas the city of gifu with emissions of 2 31 tco2 capita had the highest level of emissions of the three cities in the chukyo area moreover while the kinki area had an average emissions level of 2 20 tco2 capita otsu and kyoto had relatively high levels 2 38 and 2 32 tco2 capita respectively chiba in the shuto area and kobe in the kinki area could be considered the greenest cities across the three metropolitan areas with total co2 emissions of 1 49 and 1 84 tco2 capita respectively indirect emissions in the three metropolitan areas were found to be generally greater than direct emissions accounting for nearly half of total emissions for example in the shuto area utsunomiya was determined to have the highest total and direct emissions while the highest level of indirect emissions was found in tokyo the next sections provide an in depth exploration of emission types both direct and indirect 4 2 direct household co2 with respect to direct household co2 emissions gas manufactured piped and gasoline were found to produce higher emissions levels than kerosene and liquefied propane in the shuto area table 2 total direct emissions in utsunomiya were measured at 1 13 tco2 capita with gasoline emissions accounting for 51 of the total gasoline related emissions accounted for the lowest proportion of total direct emissions in tokyo only 21 one important reason for this is that households in tokyo benefit substantially from public transportation which produces lower levels of emissions yokohama is similar in this respect having a highly developed urban transportation system that tends to reduce household gasoline consumption and associated co2 emissions in contrast in kofu utsunomiya and maebashi more than 50 of the direct emissions are gasoline based in terms of direct gas combustion tokyo households generate the highest emissions 0 57 tco2 capita the greenest city in the shuto area appears to be chiba the prefectural capital of chiba prefecture 0 53 tco2 capita as for the cities of chukyo metropolitan area gifu had the highest level of gasoline related emissions 0 55 tco2 capita whereas nagoya had the lowest level 0 34 tco2 capita similar to tokyo in the shuto area nagoya had relatively high emissions related to gas manufactured piped combustion and relatively low emissions from gasoline consumption in kinki area total direct household energy related emissions were generally lower than in the shuto and chukyo metropolitan areas except for wakayama cities in the kinki area generated co2 mostly from gas manufactured piped consumption gasoline related emissions were lower than in the other two metropolitan areas with osaka having the lowest level 0 15 tco2 capita fig 5 provides a comparison of direct household energy related emissions in the three metropolitan areas as shown direct consumption and emissions varied among the cities the highest emissions associated with gas manufactured piped consumption were in tokyo and kyoto 0 57 tco2 capita mito and utsunomiya were found to have the highest direct emissions related to kerosene consumption 0 22 tco2 capita which is consistent with studies showing that kerosene consumption is related to temperature as it is mainly used for heating in colder areas mito utsunomiya and gifu had relatively high levels of gasoline related emissions 4 3 indirect household co2 indirect household co2 emissions derive from the diverse processes in the life cycle of energy products and services wang et al 2014 in this study co2 emission intensities were determined using the glio model developed by the japanese national institute of environmental studies nansai et al 2009 nansai et al 2012 household energy related indirect emission intensities for the four indicated sources were based on the 3eid database table 3 shows the indirect emissions of the three metropolitan areas in the shuto area the indirect emission totals for each city are greater than the corresponding direct emissions reported in table 2 electricity accounts for a majority of the indirect emissions while gas other fuel light and water sewerage all play relatively minor roles a similar situation occurs in both the chukyo and kinki areas as in shuto electricity plays the dominant role since the great earthquake of 2011 electricity consumption has produced dramatically greater emissions due primarily to the suspension of operations at the fukushima nuclear power plant the suspension has meant that higher co2 emitting fossil fuel based power plants have assumed a greater role in power generation finally fig 6 provides a comparison of the various indirect emission sources across the three metropolitan areas in all three areas electricity consumption is a major emissions source with electricity driven co2 emissions reaching a high of 1 18 tco2 capita in tokyo indirect emissions were generally found to be greater than emissions produced from direct combustion although the specific nature of direct and indirect emissions varies by city as can be seen here an overwhelming majority of indirect emissions comes from electricity production dividing energy related emissions into their direct and indirect components highlights the need for flexible and varied city level responses based on the different emissions sources including indirect emissions provides a way to examine household energy utilization structures in a comprehensive way and is potentially helpful to local governments seeking to quantify their responsibility and advance the implementation of effective emission reduction policies 4 4 discussion this study examined per capita household energy demand emissions in japan s mega cities and revealed structural differences across the country s three major metropolitan areas results indicate that indirect co2 emissions including those associated with energy processing and sewage disposal are generally greater than direct emissions of co2 in japan which agrees with previous research focused on china liu et al 2011 and korea park and heo 2007 in recent years regional and city efforts have emphasized local mitigation planning expanding the need for more micro scale research in contrast to earlier studies city level energy demand emissions were evaluated here with high resolution emissions information support household emissions can be substantially lowered by changing consumption patterns e g mobility demand and mode energy use in households and the choice of longer lasting products ipcc 2014a this study reveals differences in emissions patterns among the various cities fig 7 providing the type of detailed information needed to formulate and fine tune concrete emission reduction plans as mentioned above the focus of this study is on household need energy consumption and associated co2 emissions as this sector uniquely generates co2 emissions both in direct combustion and through related indirect production processes in most previous household energy consumption studies only the direct utilization of energy is considered presenting a distinctly incomplete picture including the emissions embodied in indirect production processes allows us to better quantify and assign regional emissions responsibility this would mean for example that tokyo which was found to have extremely high indirect emissions primarily from the use of electricity by the city s households would be assigned responsibility for these indirect emissions rather than the region that produced the electric power such an approach one that appropriately assigns responsibility for emissions at the city level has a number of important policy implications given that the energy related emissions analyzed in this study focus on energy demand in the residential sector a closer look at particular residential sources may be instructive household demand for transportation and cooking can likely be related to household lifestyle and urban geographic characteristics in contrast demand for heating and bathing would seem not to be connected directly to household lifestyle but rather reflect natural indicators such as climate and temperature for example based on data from the japan meteorological agency for the years 1981 to 2010 the relatively high direct emissions in mito utsunomiya and gifu may be attributed to the fact that the average number of days that could be described as extremely cold lowest temperature below 0 c for these cities was 77 83 and 71 days respectively while tokyo chiba yokohama and nagoya had temperatures above 0 c throughout the year fig 7 shows the intercity disparity regarding emission type and emission structures in the shuto area utsunomiya had the highest emission level for both direct and total emissions while tokyo had the highest indirect emissions level in general the higher direct emission cities are found away from tokyo bay in the chukyo area gifu was found to have high levels of both direct and indirect emissions with gasoline contributing substantially to the direct emissions therefore tentatively conclusion could be proposed as fewer city dwellers can result in higher per capital emissions both direct and indirect as they relate to energy demand in the kinki area kyoto had the highest indirect emission levels mostly attributable to electricity gas and water related emissions the kinki area as a whole had the highest electricity related emission levels in such a circumstance assigning proper responsibility at the city level is needed so that measures such as emissions quotas and or emissions focused tax policy can be developed to address emissions imbalances a consumption based co2 emissions quota system can effectively guide personal consumer behaviors fan et al 2012 government can also use the type of environmental measurements presented in this study to label products or devise a green levy program in which the most co2 intensive commodities carry the highest levies liu et al 2011 5 conclusions and implications 5 1 conclusions in this study we used carbon intensities and household consumption inventories to measure both direct and indirect household energy related emissions rather than per household carbon emissions we utilized per capita values in conducting our correlation and regression analysis due largely to differences in development from region to region urban household co2 emissions were found to vary substantially at the same time both natural and social differences including lifestyle and economic endowment differences can also contribute to intercity variations we focused on three japanese metropolitan areas containing many of the most developed cities in japan cities that are generally considered to be the country s cultural economic and political centers still there are other influencing factors that need to be considered in future research additional research is needed to determine both direct and indirect carbon emissions for a much broader range of household items and activities using a hybrid evaluation method to provide accurate emissions data such information can serve as the basis for developing an environmentally friendly household consumption model and promoting low carbon lifestyles among the megacities studied per capita emissions were not necessarily highest in cities with the largest populations i e tokyo osaka and nagoya in our study the highest levels appeared in cities such as utsunomiya and kofu this suggests that more research on personal energy efficiency and its correlation with city characteristics is needed while city scale studies dealing with the reduction of direct emissions are available city scale studies addressing indirect co2 emissions are rare such studies can be expected to provide better sectoral and spatially explicit information for better mitigation policymaking and environmental education at the urban level these studies can also offer useful insights stemming from an in depth investigation of the relationships between co2 emissions distributions and urban socioeconomic activities and hence benefit future low carbon city scale research and practice 5 2 policy implications our research has a number of policy implications first our findings offer sectoral and spatially explicit information on greenhouse gas emissions ghgs specifically co2 with a detailed local database this should enable policymakers to design mitigation policies that apply a combination of national top down approaches and local bottom up measures importantly a decomposition of mitigation targets based on our results can be used to support local low carbon initiatives for example per capita emissions were found to be highest in cities with lower population densities utsunomiya and kofu rather than tokyo or osaka which have higher population densities this supports the proposition that depopulation in japan leads to a higher emissions lifestyle among urban residents given the country s continuing demographic transition mitigation policies in the future will need to deal with emissions in depopulating areas by decomposing mitigation targets at the city level urban emissions responsibility can be more appropriately assigned or re assigned which should lead to policies that are more fair and effective second our methodology advances the cause of sustainable consumption that considers both sustainable production the producer side and sustainable behavior the consumer side a better understanding of japanese carbon footprints particularly in light of japan s changing demographics is essential for transitioning to a low carbon society and encouraging more environmentally friendly household lifestyles as well as low carbon consumption behaviors our results indicate that some cities have particular high energy demand not surprisingly for example cities located in northern areas require more energy for heating which provide insights to policy maker as how to considering city specific energy mix to reduce emission such consumption preferences could be the starting point for implementing efficient reduction polices identifying areas where small policy changes will potentially have the greatest effect in sum emission reduction policies should be customized according to specific city consumption characteristics the present study emphasizes the importance of city level data collection this should lead the way to studies that include more extensive and detailed data to establish relevant correlations between household level parameters and city level parameters population densities access to public transportation and economic factors such as quality of life so that an overall roadmap to improving the urban socioeconomic and material energy metabolism can be produced as noted japan is a leader in the construction of high resolution local spatial databases and the implementation of comprehensive data reporting schemes both of which can serve as a model for other countries seeking to devise a local decision support system for low carbon practices the current 3eid database offers massive labor cost savings for japanese researchers in need of making indirect emissions calculations as part of their environmental studies the environmental policymaking process especially at the local level requires rapid responses to environment issues once a detailed database is constructed and made easily accessible local policymakers and research scholars will be in a position to quickly and effectively respond to changing environmental conditions finally the present study lays the groundwork for future studies aimed at navigating the transition to a low carbon future offering insights on important influencing factors such as the impact of various energy sources the urban infrastructure system e g the urban transport system and personal and family behaviors besides varied urban energy structure and consumption habits shown by this study indicates future city scale energy supply should fully consider urban characteristics to implement co2 reduction policy in future works a follow up detailed and in depth analysis on such environmental and social factors e g via sensitivity analysis and related mechanisms would appear to be an appropriate next step acknowledgements long yin wishes to thank the grant for ph d research program for ay 2016 and 2017 from the university of tokyo and the kashiyama scholarship foundation of

25298,in the post paris era urban emissions have received worldwide attention as cities are considered to be responsible for most of the world s environmental footprint a better understanding of urban co2 emissions and their related carbon footprints offers benefits to policymakers interested in promoting effective and efficient low carbon solutions in particular a clear determination of direct and indirect emissions inventories that is identification of emissions related to specific sources can provide a valuable baseline for the planning assessing implementing and monitoring of urban mitigation actions focusing on the japanese urban residential sector this paper uses an established urban database and emission database based on global related input output analysis to systematically analyze household carbon footprints related to energy demand targeting both direct and indirect energy related co2 emissions in japan s megacities the results reveal the city specific emissions status of japan s three major metropolitan areas showing for example that tokyo is a source of high direct emissions while utsunomiya is a significant source of indirect emissions the study also tentatively concludes that the depopulation of cities can result in higher per capital emissions both direct and indirect as they relate to energy demand improved sector and spatially explicit information for better mitigation policymaking and environmental education at the urban level is presented valuable insights are offered through an in depth investigation of the relationship between co2 emissions and urban socioeconomic activities benefitting future low carbon city research and practice keywords metropolitan areas household carbon footprints 3eid intercity disparity japan 1 introduction in the post paris era increasing attention is being given to global co2 emissions mitigation with particular focus on the world s cities fujii et al 2016 togawa et al 2014 this urban focus comes as no surprise since cities are considered responsible for a majority of anthropogenic co2 emissions cooper 2016 van de graaf 2017 a better understanding of emissions sources and drivers and the design and impact of countermeasures is necessary to support ongoing efforts to reduce these co2 emissions dong et al 2016b kok et al 2006 cities are the carriers of the intensive socioeconomic metabolism of human beings as well as being responsible for most of the world s environmental footprint dong et al 2016a b with the growth of urban populations over the past several decades cities now accommodate more than half of the world s population and have become a critical sector in energy consumption and energy demand emissions as a consequence urban co2 emissions have emerged as an extremely important consideration in any comprehensive policy aimed at reducing the harmful effects of anthropogenic emissions liang et al 2016a b 2014 sun et al 2017 among the various urban sectors the household sector is critical it accounts for roughly 70 of final consumption expenditures an amount that is expected to increase given the continuing urbanization process and the projected rise in living standards kennedy et al 2009 urban household emissions and inventories are thus attracting increased attention li et al 2015 nässén 2014 pukšec et al 2014 su et al 2017 and are expected to play a major role on the consumer side of co2 reduction polices that urban co2 emissions need to be a crucial part of any mitigation policy discussion is undeniable however compared to the number of studies done on global co2 emissions at the national level andrew et al 2009 jones and kammen 2011 wiedmann 2009b or the regional level brizga et al 2017 liang et al 2007 tian et al 2014 2016 there are still relatively few urban scale studies the need for such studies seems clear particularly those focused on individual city co2 emissions and current intercity disparities feng et al 2014 vandeweghe and kennedy 2007 a systematic analysis of urban co2 emissions and mitigation focused on the household sector offers a solid basis for the design of countermeasures to improve consumption patterns and alleviate some of the more serious negative impacts of climate change ipcc 2014b since urban residential co2 emissions are a critical consideration in any comprehensive co2 mitigation policy identifying urban household patterns of consumption is essential chen et al 2017 geng et al 2017 park et al 2017 urban policymakers clearly need to confront the coming challenge and guide urban residents to cultivate an economical and environmentally friendly lifestyle however without a sufficient understanding of city scale emissions and intercity differences effective mitigation policies will be all but impossible to devise and implement wakiyama and kuramochi 2017 zang et al 2017 household co2 emissions can be assigned to either monetary or physical consumption categories and can be sourced from various sectors e g accommodation transportation and energy among these the household energy related sector stands alone in causing co2 emissions both directly and indirectly jiang 2016 setlhaolo and xia 2016 for example the direct consumption of energy e g petrol gas water and kerosene creates co2 directly in contrast carbon emissions embedded in demand responsive energy production processes are treated as indirect emissions indirect household emissions have been the focus of a number of input output io models it has been demonstrated for example that more than 60 of household emissions are produced in an indirect way in the korean residential sector park and heo 2007 in fact indirect energy consumption energy consumption embedded in the production process and its associated carbon emissions have been found to be greater than direct consumption and emissions in a number of urban household studies feng et al 2011 pointing to the need to include both components when measuring total household contributions sommer and kratena 2017 veeramani et al 2017 in addressing this issue measuring carbon footprints offers a scientific approach to comprehensively assessing carbon emissions associated with human activity kanemoto et al 2016 wiedmann 2009a this approach is used in the present study to capture the full environmental burden that can be linked to the urban residential sector japan continues to make significant efforts to promote low carbon policies fujii et al 2016 togawa et al 2014 as such it offers an ideal laboratory to conduct studies to address the research challenges noted above and to test the feasibility of potential mitigation methods furthermore japan has a large integrated and detailed statistical database and spatial data at the urban and regional levels that strongly support regional decision making regarding low carbon actions togawa et al 2016 in addition as a mature developed country japan s co2 emissions from its residential sector account for a major portion of the country s overall emissions of the total japanese national co2 emissions in 2014 estimated to be 126 5 million tons 19 2 million tons were associated with the residential sector compared to 42 6 million tons from the transportation sector 21 7 million tons from the industrial sector and 26 1 million tons from the commercial sector moreover while emissions from the industrial sector have been decreasing in recent years emissions from the residential sector increased 6 6 between 2005 and 2014 moe 2016 additionally since the great east earthquake in 2011 put tremendous pressure on the energy supply and carbon mitigation countermeasures reducing residential co2 emissions has become a critical topic taken together these factors make japan an ideal testing laboratory and a promising source of enlightening insights into the future of other regions in the world given the above argument the following questions merit consideration in order to better understand urban household emissions in japan 1 what are the trends for household energy demand consumption and emissions in japanese megacities 2 differences between emissions from direct combustion and emissions embedded in related indirect processes 3 what are the relevant emissions patterns and what are the underlying factors e g per capita emissions urban population density and consumption style 4 are there differences in household energy consumption among the various metropolitan areas spatial features answering these questions has important policy implications for the design and implementation of effective local and regional measures to provide answers the present study investigated household energy demand carbon footprints including energy demand co2 emissions generated both directly and indirectly using an advanced io approach and a detailed local database along with relevant statistics we first calculate direct household emissions using the family income and expenditure survey fies together with co2 emission intensities derived from the resource energy statistics of japan we then evaluate indirect residential household co2 emission based on emission intensities derived from 3eid embodied energy and emission intensity data for japan using input output tables and the household consumption inventories in three metropolitan areas in japan the kinki chukyo and shuto areas the source categories including household related features of carbon footprints and intercity disparities are investigated in depth and provide detailed information for future mitigation policy and priority setting importantly the present study presents sectoral and spatially explicit information that will enable more effective mitigation policymaking and environmental education at the urban level the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the methodology to evaluate household co2 emissions in both direct and indirect ways section 3 describes the case study areas section 4 presents analytical results and related discussions section 5 summarizes conclusions and outlines policy implications 2 methods and data 2 1 household co2 emissions on energy demand household energy consumption can be classified as either direct consumption which involves the combustion process or indirect consumption which involves other processes such as energy production and disposal as a general rule the production of goods and services requires the direct use of inputs which in turn use inputs from other sectors at different stages of the industrial process this latter component is called indirect use liu et al 2011 in this study we focus on the unique household need that generates emissions not only directly but also indirectly the household need for energy we compare the two emissions types and identify intercity disparities for purposes of the study energy directly consumed by a household consists of manufactured and piped gas liquefied propane kerosene and gasoline used in combustion when a household consumes combusts one or more of these energy sources direct emissions are generated at the same time households also consume energy in other ways using for example electricity natural gas water and other fuels for lighting and heating although direct utilization of these energy sources does not generate co2 emissions directly their upstream production can be a source of substantial emissions it seems clear that when we focus on emissions associated with the energy related consumption of the residential sector both direct and indirect emissions should be included water is an especially interesting case although most residential energy demand emissions occur both in the production and utilization processes water usage which includes sewage generates emissions during the final disposal process therefore we considered the waste water disposal process as part of the water need emission intensity fig 1 shows the system boundaries of the study 2 2 data compliance for evaluating household energy related co2 emissions as discussed earlier household co2 emissions are embedded in energy consumption both in direct and indirect ways direct household carbon emissions can be calculated based on the various energy sources and their corresponding emission factors converting energy consumption into household direct emissions can be achieved simply by multiplying the emission intensities of each energy source and summing across all sources indirect energy consumption and emissions can be calculated using input output analysis ioa to identify the energy embodied in a unit of production the resulting household consumption measure reflects not only the energy used as direct inputs into the production of each good but also the energy used in the intermediate inputs used in the production of that good and the energy used in the intermediate inputs of those intermediate inputs while direct energy emissions can be deduced from energy consumption data indirect emission intensities are derived from national or regional io tables the above cited 3eid utilizes an io life cycle assessment lca method with a global link input output glio model nansai et al 2012 and can be considered a simplified multi regional input output mrio model that guarantees system boundaries while achieving data management cost reductions shigetomi et al 2014 emission intensities can be used to evaluate indirect emissions associated with the production process here tco2 capita per one million yen tco2 capita m jpy is estimated from the household consumption of these items using a glio model for this study we used per capita consumption in 2005 one year to evaluate the emissions in the following discussion we apply the per capita value to evaluate urban emissions performance since household size varies in japan the monetary inventory for three metropolitan areas is derived from the fies both monetary and non monetary incentives as well as information measures can be used to encourage behavioral changes ipcc 2014a that will reduce household energy demand emissions by multiplying the monetary consumption of households for each energy demand category and summing the products the total emissions generated by cities both in direct and indirect ways can be determined 2 2 1 direct household emission from energy consumption direct emissions are relatively easy to evaluate since physical consumption of direct energy sources can be identified from a household s monetary inventory per household direct co2 emissions from direct energy consumption can be derived by multiplying unit price and net calorific value using household size data from fies allows us to then determine per capita emissions values we first calculated direct household energy consumption using the household s consumption inventory as presented in following equations 1 d h c f k i 1 n e g i i i 2 e g i e c i e p i where d h c f k represents direct carbon emissions from city k i is the energy type such as gasoline or kerosene i i refers to the carbon emissions factor of energy use for energy type i e g i is the energy consumption of energy type i e c i is the household monetary purchase of energy type i and e p i is the average unit price of energy i in this study unit price data were obtained from city prefectural statistics data for 2005 the co2 emission factor for direct combustion can be found in resource and energy statistics of japan for 2005 finally the fies for 2005 gives the monetary value for the household consumption of energy 2 2 2 indirect household energy related emissions household indirect energy consumption and associated co2 emissions can be calculated using a variety of methods we use ioa to identify the emissions embodied in a unit of consumption the 3eid database provides emission intensities that include upstream emissions such as those from energy investment in other sectors the database provides indirect co2 emissions following the entire supply chain nansai et al 2012 shigetomi et al 2014 and can be used freely and easily to evaluate the environmental performance of virtually all consumption items in japan the dataset can be considered a simplified multi regional model that guarantees boundaries for the entire system a total of 406 japanese domestic and imported commodities were used to calculate carbon dioxide emission intensities measured in tco2eq per m jpy 1 usd 112 96 jpy 2017 10 19 the dataset can be combined with household consumption inventories for estimating household emissions by residential monetary input we selected our emission intensities from this database and matched each item with the city level monetary consumption measures from the fies thus city k s indirect carbon footprint can be determined as 3 i h c f k e f i n d c y k where i h c f k is city k s indirect carbon footprint y k is the monetary expenditure on each consumption item and e f i n d c refers to emission intensities derived from the 3eid inventory we derived the household emission intensities of the energy demand items from this dataset thus a city s total carbon footprint can be expressed as 4 h c f k i h c f k d h c f k i 1 n e g i i i e f i n d c y k where h c f k is the total carbon footprint of household k fig 2 shows a flowchart for the data compliance process steps in which fies data were used are indicated by the dotted outlines 3 overview of case study areas with diverse activities and lifestyles cities are among the most complex emissions sources not surprisingly citizen activities are considered a major determinant of a city s climatic impact ishii et al 2010 cities now accommodate more than half of the world s population and urban populations have for several decades been increasing at an accelerated pace rapid economic growth and improvements in city living conditions have brought with them less environmentally friendly lifestyles and increased per capita household emissions given the intense energy and resource demands placed on cities today s cities have an opportunity and obligation to explore a wide array of technology and policy options to increase energy efficiency and reduce per capita consumption and emissions parshall et al 2010 in this regard a comparative analysis of cities based on an investigation of emissions sources and their relationship with various lifestyles has potentially significant value the government of japan recently announced a stronger focus on residential co2 emissions in response to pressures from both energy supply and household dilution as a typical developed country the population of japan reached a peak of 128 8 million people in 2004 and is expected to follow a steadily declining trend at the same time the decline in the number of household members has generated more small scale even single member households such household dilution is not unique to japan smaller households will become the modal household type in the u s underwood and zahran 2015 and most other developed countries household size has been shown to be significantly correlated with co2 emissions underwood and zahran 2015 which suggests that per capita household emissions can be expected to increase with the decline in household size to accomplish emissions reduction targets multiple efforts are expected from officials at both the national and regional levels of government however without a sufficient understanding of the status of emissions locally such reduction policies are unlikely to be implemented effectively and efficiently complicating matters japan s urban household emissions are now in a transition period making the future very difficult to predict given this circumstance local mitigation actions will be crucial in response to this need cities in three specific metropolitan areas having typical and representative urban emission features were selected for study the japanese cities chosen are located in three highly urbanized metropolitan areas known as shuto chukyo and kinki these three areas are considered the central areas of japan in terms of polity economics and culture fig 3 provides a map of the three areas as shown the shuto metropolitan area contains tokyo and seven other prefectural cities saitama mito utsunomiya yokohama chiba kofu and maebashi the metropolitan chukyo area contains nagoya gifu and tsu and the kinki area contains six mega cities osaka kyoto nara otsu kobe and wakayama table 1 provides basic information regarding the targeted metropolitan areas the constituent cities are characterized by high population densities with tokyo and osaka leading the way with a population density exceeding 10 000 people per square kilometer as evidenced by the age data provided here japan is an aging society with a large proportion of senior citizens people above 65 years of age among the selected megacities kofu 22 2 wakayama 22 1 maebashi 20 5 and osaka 20 1 have especially high proportions in each of these cities more than one in five residents is a senior citizen in light of the current demographic situation and future population trends household emission studies involving japan s major metropolitan areas can be assumed to reflect typical japanese emission characteristics however current top down emission reduction approaches do not sufficiently consider regional disparities and emission structures i e emission sources or emission types this issue differentiating energy demand emissions based on emission type and sector at the megacity level is discussed next 4 results and discussion 4 1 total household energy related co2 fig 4 shows total household energy related co2 emissions for the targeted cities as the figure suggests emissions exhibited different characteristics across the three metropolitan areas specifically the average 2005 household emissions per capita for the shuto cities 2 17 tco2 is lower than the average for both the chukyo cities 2 31 tco2 and the kinki cities 2 20 tco2 the maximum emissions value occurs in utsunomiya the capital city of tochigi prefecture the chukyo area co2 emissions average is greater than the averages of the other two metropolitan areas the city of gifu with emissions of 2 31 tco2 capita had the highest level of emissions of the three cities in the chukyo area moreover while the kinki area had an average emissions level of 2 20 tco2 capita otsu and kyoto had relatively high levels 2 38 and 2 32 tco2 capita respectively chiba in the shuto area and kobe in the kinki area could be considered the greenest cities across the three metropolitan areas with total co2 emissions of 1 49 and 1 84 tco2 capita respectively indirect emissions in the three metropolitan areas were found to be generally greater than direct emissions accounting for nearly half of total emissions for example in the shuto area utsunomiya was determined to have the highest total and direct emissions while the highest level of indirect emissions was found in tokyo the next sections provide an in depth exploration of emission types both direct and indirect 4 2 direct household co2 with respect to direct household co2 emissions gas manufactured piped and gasoline were found to produce higher emissions levels than kerosene and liquefied propane in the shuto area table 2 total direct emissions in utsunomiya were measured at 1 13 tco2 capita with gasoline emissions accounting for 51 of the total gasoline related emissions accounted for the lowest proportion of total direct emissions in tokyo only 21 one important reason for this is that households in tokyo benefit substantially from public transportation which produces lower levels of emissions yokohama is similar in this respect having a highly developed urban transportation system that tends to reduce household gasoline consumption and associated co2 emissions in contrast in kofu utsunomiya and maebashi more than 50 of the direct emissions are gasoline based in terms of direct gas combustion tokyo households generate the highest emissions 0 57 tco2 capita the greenest city in the shuto area appears to be chiba the prefectural capital of chiba prefecture 0 53 tco2 capita as for the cities of chukyo metropolitan area gifu had the highest level of gasoline related emissions 0 55 tco2 capita whereas nagoya had the lowest level 0 34 tco2 capita similar to tokyo in the shuto area nagoya had relatively high emissions related to gas manufactured piped combustion and relatively low emissions from gasoline consumption in kinki area total direct household energy related emissions were generally lower than in the shuto and chukyo metropolitan areas except for wakayama cities in the kinki area generated co2 mostly from gas manufactured piped consumption gasoline related emissions were lower than in the other two metropolitan areas with osaka having the lowest level 0 15 tco2 capita fig 5 provides a comparison of direct household energy related emissions in the three metropolitan areas as shown direct consumption and emissions varied among the cities the highest emissions associated with gas manufactured piped consumption were in tokyo and kyoto 0 57 tco2 capita mito and utsunomiya were found to have the highest direct emissions related to kerosene consumption 0 22 tco2 capita which is consistent with studies showing that kerosene consumption is related to temperature as it is mainly used for heating in colder areas mito utsunomiya and gifu had relatively high levels of gasoline related emissions 4 3 indirect household co2 indirect household co2 emissions derive from the diverse processes in the life cycle of energy products and services wang et al 2014 in this study co2 emission intensities were determined using the glio model developed by the japanese national institute of environmental studies nansai et al 2009 nansai et al 2012 household energy related indirect emission intensities for the four indicated sources were based on the 3eid database table 3 shows the indirect emissions of the three metropolitan areas in the shuto area the indirect emission totals for each city are greater than the corresponding direct emissions reported in table 2 electricity accounts for a majority of the indirect emissions while gas other fuel light and water sewerage all play relatively minor roles a similar situation occurs in both the chukyo and kinki areas as in shuto electricity plays the dominant role since the great earthquake of 2011 electricity consumption has produced dramatically greater emissions due primarily to the suspension of operations at the fukushima nuclear power plant the suspension has meant that higher co2 emitting fossil fuel based power plants have assumed a greater role in power generation finally fig 6 provides a comparison of the various indirect emission sources across the three metropolitan areas in all three areas electricity consumption is a major emissions source with electricity driven co2 emissions reaching a high of 1 18 tco2 capita in tokyo indirect emissions were generally found to be greater than emissions produced from direct combustion although the specific nature of direct and indirect emissions varies by city as can be seen here an overwhelming majority of indirect emissions comes from electricity production dividing energy related emissions into their direct and indirect components highlights the need for flexible and varied city level responses based on the different emissions sources including indirect emissions provides a way to examine household energy utilization structures in a comprehensive way and is potentially helpful to local governments seeking to quantify their responsibility and advance the implementation of effective emission reduction policies 4 4 discussion this study examined per capita household energy demand emissions in japan s mega cities and revealed structural differences across the country s three major metropolitan areas results indicate that indirect co2 emissions including those associated with energy processing and sewage disposal are generally greater than direct emissions of co2 in japan which agrees with previous research focused on china liu et al 2011 and korea park and heo 2007 in recent years regional and city efforts have emphasized local mitigation planning expanding the need for more micro scale research in contrast to earlier studies city level energy demand emissions were evaluated here with high resolution emissions information support household emissions can be substantially lowered by changing consumption patterns e g mobility demand and mode energy use in households and the choice of longer lasting products ipcc 2014a this study reveals differences in emissions patterns among the various cities fig 7 providing the type of detailed information needed to formulate and fine tune concrete emission reduction plans as mentioned above the focus of this study is on household need energy consumption and associated co2 emissions as this sector uniquely generates co2 emissions both in direct combustion and through related indirect production processes in most previous household energy consumption studies only the direct utilization of energy is considered presenting a distinctly incomplete picture including the emissions embodied in indirect production processes allows us to better quantify and assign regional emissions responsibility this would mean for example that tokyo which was found to have extremely high indirect emissions primarily from the use of electricity by the city s households would be assigned responsibility for these indirect emissions rather than the region that produced the electric power such an approach one that appropriately assigns responsibility for emissions at the city level has a number of important policy implications given that the energy related emissions analyzed in this study focus on energy demand in the residential sector a closer look at particular residential sources may be instructive household demand for transportation and cooking can likely be related to household lifestyle and urban geographic characteristics in contrast demand for heating and bathing would seem not to be connected directly to household lifestyle but rather reflect natural indicators such as climate and temperature for example based on data from the japan meteorological agency for the years 1981 to 2010 the relatively high direct emissions in mito utsunomiya and gifu may be attributed to the fact that the average number of days that could be described as extremely cold lowest temperature below 0 c for these cities was 77 83 and 71 days respectively while tokyo chiba yokohama and nagoya had temperatures above 0 c throughout the year fig 7 shows the intercity disparity regarding emission type and emission structures in the shuto area utsunomiya had the highest emission level for both direct and total emissions while tokyo had the highest indirect emissions level in general the higher direct emission cities are found away from tokyo bay in the chukyo area gifu was found to have high levels of both direct and indirect emissions with gasoline contributing substantially to the direct emissions therefore tentatively conclusion could be proposed as fewer city dwellers can result in higher per capital emissions both direct and indirect as they relate to energy demand in the kinki area kyoto had the highest indirect emission levels mostly attributable to electricity gas and water related emissions the kinki area as a whole had the highest electricity related emission levels in such a circumstance assigning proper responsibility at the city level is needed so that measures such as emissions quotas and or emissions focused tax policy can be developed to address emissions imbalances a consumption based co2 emissions quota system can effectively guide personal consumer behaviors fan et al 2012 government can also use the type of environmental measurements presented in this study to label products or devise a green levy program in which the most co2 intensive commodities carry the highest levies liu et al 2011 5 conclusions and implications 5 1 conclusions in this study we used carbon intensities and household consumption inventories to measure both direct and indirect household energy related emissions rather than per household carbon emissions we utilized per capita values in conducting our correlation and regression analysis due largely to differences in development from region to region urban household co2 emissions were found to vary substantially at the same time both natural and social differences including lifestyle and economic endowment differences can also contribute to intercity variations we focused on three japanese metropolitan areas containing many of the most developed cities in japan cities that are generally considered to be the country s cultural economic and political centers still there are other influencing factors that need to be considered in future research additional research is needed to determine both direct and indirect carbon emissions for a much broader range of household items and activities using a hybrid evaluation method to provide accurate emissions data such information can serve as the basis for developing an environmentally friendly household consumption model and promoting low carbon lifestyles among the megacities studied per capita emissions were not necessarily highest in cities with the largest populations i e tokyo osaka and nagoya in our study the highest levels appeared in cities such as utsunomiya and kofu this suggests that more research on personal energy efficiency and its correlation with city characteristics is needed while city scale studies dealing with the reduction of direct emissions are available city scale studies addressing indirect co2 emissions are rare such studies can be expected to provide better sectoral and spatially explicit information for better mitigation policymaking and environmental education at the urban level these studies can also offer useful insights stemming from an in depth investigation of the relationships between co2 emissions distributions and urban socioeconomic activities and hence benefit future low carbon city scale research and practice 5 2 policy implications our research has a number of policy implications first our findings offer sectoral and spatially explicit information on greenhouse gas emissions ghgs specifically co2 with a detailed local database this should enable policymakers to design mitigation policies that apply a combination of national top down approaches and local bottom up measures importantly a decomposition of mitigation targets based on our results can be used to support local low carbon initiatives for example per capita emissions were found to be highest in cities with lower population densities utsunomiya and kofu rather than tokyo or osaka which have higher population densities this supports the proposition that depopulation in japan leads to a higher emissions lifestyle among urban residents given the country s continuing demographic transition mitigation policies in the future will need to deal with emissions in depopulating areas by decomposing mitigation targets at the city level urban emissions responsibility can be more appropriately assigned or re assigned which should lead to policies that are more fair and effective second our methodology advances the cause of sustainable consumption that considers both sustainable production the producer side and sustainable behavior the consumer side a better understanding of japanese carbon footprints particularly in light of japan s changing demographics is essential for transitioning to a low carbon society and encouraging more environmentally friendly household lifestyles as well as low carbon consumption behaviors our results indicate that some cities have particular high energy demand not surprisingly for example cities located in northern areas require more energy for heating which provide insights to policy maker as how to considering city specific energy mix to reduce emission such consumption preferences could be the starting point for implementing efficient reduction polices identifying areas where small policy changes will potentially have the greatest effect in sum emission reduction policies should be customized according to specific city consumption characteristics the present study emphasizes the importance of city level data collection this should lead the way to studies that include more extensive and detailed data to establish relevant correlations between household level parameters and city level parameters population densities access to public transportation and economic factors such as quality of life so that an overall roadmap to improving the urban socioeconomic and material energy metabolism can be produced as noted japan is a leader in the construction of high resolution local spatial databases and the implementation of comprehensive data reporting schemes both of which can serve as a model for other countries seeking to devise a local decision support system for low carbon practices the current 3eid database offers massive labor cost savings for japanese researchers in need of making indirect emissions calculations as part of their environmental studies the environmental policymaking process especially at the local level requires rapid responses to environment issues once a detailed database is constructed and made easily accessible local policymakers and research scholars will be in a position to quickly and effectively respond to changing environmental conditions finally the present study lays the groundwork for future studies aimed at navigating the transition to a low carbon future offering insights on important influencing factors such as the impact of various energy sources the urban infrastructure system e g the urban transport system and personal and family behaviors besides varied urban energy structure and consumption habits shown by this study indicates future city scale energy supply should fully consider urban characteristics to implement co2 reduction policy in future works a follow up detailed and in depth analysis on such environmental and social factors e g via sensitivity analysis and related mechanisms would appear to be an appropriate next step acknowledgements long yin wishes to thank the grant for ph d research program for ay 2016 and 2017 from the university of tokyo and the kashiyama scholarship foundation of

25299,climate change has significant impacts on crop yields and could greatly affect global food security as an advanced process based land surface model the community land model clm includes a comprehensive crop model clm crop which aims to simulate crop growth globally although this model has been evaluated in the united states it is not clear whether it can be applied successfully in other parts of the world in this study we evaluate the applicability of clm crop for maize growth simulation in northeast china one of the major agricultural production areas in china simulated lai plant carbon phenology and yields of maize were compared with observations at agricultural experiment and meteorological stations and with statistical reports the clm crop model overestimated lai and underestimated leaf and stem carbon during the growing period planting and harvesting dates were overestimated in the eastern part of the study area but underestimated in the southern part correlation r 0 26 between simulated and reported yield was poor yields were generally overestimated especially in the east and south parts which may be due to imperfect farming practices on working farms some parameters including temperature thresholds of planting and crop management parameters have spatial heterogeneity rather than the default fixed parameters in clm crop development of gridded crop parameters is expected to improve simulation of crop phenology and yield estimation at the regional and global scales keywords community land model maize phenology crop yield northeast china 1 introduction climate change may significantly affect crop yields and therefore global food security peng et al 2004 rosenzweig et al 2014 schlenker and roberts 2009 numerous studies have shown that climate change such as increasing temperature and frequency and severity of extreme climate events may have substantial effects on crop growth and yield actions must therefore be taken to adapt agriculture to climate change deryng et al 2014 lobell et al 2014 2012 osborne et al 2009 siebert et al 2014 in order to make correct decisions for agricultural adaptation crop yield prediction under climate change scenarios is key information intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2007 piao et al 2010 wang et al 2011 yao et al 2015 crop yields under climate change are commonly predicted by two approaches 1 empirical statistical models bondeau et al 2007 fader et al 2010 and 2 process based crop models liu et al 2007 yao et al 2015 empirical statistical models use regression or machine learning methods to establish the relationships between crop yield and climate variables based on historical observations ed et al 2013 hoffman et al 2018 lobell and ortizmonasterio 2007 these models are then extrapolated to plausible scenarios these models are relatively straightforward and easy to construct but they usually use temporally aggregated climate data they may thus miss important heterogeneities and may fail to capture the details of interactions between climate change and crop growth he et al 2015 hoffman et al 2018 lobell and asseng 2017 process based crop models dynamically simulate the key biophysical and biochemical processes of crop growth usually on a daily time step so they better reflect the details of the climate and can represent the complex relationships between crop growth and climate change estes et al 2013 lobell and asseng 2017 roudier et al 2011 zhao et al 2013 in the early stage of their development process based crop models were applied at the field scale where environment factors can be considered homogeneous jones et al 2003 keating et al 2003 williams et al 1989 i e represented by a single climate station in order to assess the effect of climate change on crop growth over larger areas some regional or global scale crop models emerged bondeau et al 2007 kucharik and brye 2003 levis 2010 zhang et al 2016 the community land model clm is one of the most widely used land surface models and has incorporated a comprehensive crop model named clm crop levis et al 2012 which aims to simulate crop growth globally this is helpful for predicting the impacts of climate change on agriculture over the world however the calibration and evaluation of clm crop was only conducted in united state bilionis et al 2015 chen et al 2015 drewniak et al 2013 2015 leng et al 2016 levis et al 2012 due to complex environment and human activities factors it is not clear whether clm crop as a global scale crop model can be applied successful in other regions of the world in this study we evaluate clm crop for maize growth simulation in northeast china which is a commodity grain base with strategic role in china the maize yield of this region accounts for 27 of china s total maize growing area and over 30 of its total yield national bureau of statistics of china nbsc 2011 guo et al 2013 therefore it is necessary

this region is the largest plain of china and consists of the songnen liao river and sanjiang plains fig 1 more than 90 of maize ﬁelds are rain fed national bureau of statistics of china nbsc 2011

cesm dickinson et al 2006 lawrence et al 2011 the current version clm 4 5 includes the simulation of spring wheat maize and soybean which are represented as managed crop plant functional types pfts the crop growth module in clm crop is based on the agroibis model kucharik and brye 2003 a well known dynamic vegetation model crop growth is divided into planting emergence grain filling and harvest phases the latter three phases are determined by the fraction of accumulated phenological heat units fphus drewniak et al 2013 needed to achieve the respective phase planting date is determined by the 10 day running mean t10d and minimum t10d min 2 m air temperature at every daily time step during the emergence phase carbon and nitrogen are allocated to leaves stems and roots and lai gradually increases and finally reaches its maximum which is prescribed constraints in clm crop a maximum lai at 5 0 m2 m 2 during the grain fill phase the carbon accumulated in the leaves stems and roots is reduced by translocation to the grain harvest occurs when the growing degree days gdd are equal to the growing degree days necessary for the crop to reach physiological maturity gddmat eq 1 shows how gddmat is calculated by clm crop 1 gddmat 0 85 gdd8 where gdd8 is the 20 year running mean of accumulated gdd from april to september in the northern hemisphere base 8 the maximum daily increments of 30 days gddmat is bounded from 950 to 1850 days so the growing period length can change over time detailed descriptions of clm crop can be found in oleson et al 2013 the input data of clm crop are of two main types meteorological forcing data and surface data the meteorological forcing data provided by the combined climatic research unit and national center for environment predication cruncep dataset for 1901 2010 include solar radiation temperature precipitation wind speed humidity and surface pressure at 6 hour intervals viovy 2011 the cruncep dataset is a combination of two datasets which are the cru ts3 2 0 5 0 5 grid resolution monthly data 1901 2002 mitchell and jones 2005 and the ncep reanalysis 2 5 2 5 grid resolution 6 hourly data 1948 2010 kalnay et al 1996 this dataset has been used to force clm for numerous studies of evapotranspiration vegetation growth and gross primary production mao et al 2013 2012 shi et al 2013 considering the computational load of the model the resolution of the crunep dataset in this study clm crop was run at a resolution of 0 5 0 5 approximately 2180 km2 at 45 n latitude resulting in 606 pixels for the period of 1991 2010 in clm crop surface datasets assign the fractions of land types and pfts in each grid cell crops are represented as unmanaged and managed crop pfts each crop has its own soil column and each soil column has its own carbon and nitrogen pools crops can coexist with natural vegetation in a grid cell but they do not compete with natural vegetation for resources drewniak et al 2013 the unmanaged crop dataset was derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis satellite data lawrence and chase 2007 at 0 05 the managed crop dataset in clm crop was obtained from the present day crop dataset of portmann et al 2010 which provides the global distribution and area of crops at 5 arc min for consistency with the unmanaged crop dataset modis based 0 05 i e 3 the managed crop dataset 5 was resampled to 0 05 by bilinear interpolation the managed crop pfts were then assigned based on the managed crop dataset and unmanaged crop dataset for each grid leng et al 2016 finally the land surface dataset was aggregated to the 0 5 grid resolution by summation the distribution of fractions of the maize growing area prescribed in the clm crop model is shown in fig 2 before the real simulations an accelerated spin up procedure thornton and rosenbloom 2005 was used during spin up clm crop was run offline from 1991 to 2010 with cn cycling active in order to ensure that the soil carbon and nitrogen pools reached a steady state the forcing data were recycled 50 times a total of 1000 years after spin up the resulting state variables were used to initialize subsequent simulations then the clm crop was run for 16 complete cycles of the 1991 2010 climate data a total of 320 years the last 20 years of simulation one cycle of 1991 2010 was used for analysis with daily averaged data 2 3 evaluation of model performance three observational and statistical datasets were used to validate the simulation results the first dataset was the observation data of lai and plant carbon of maize in the state key agroecological experiment station hailun county heilongjiang province china 47 26 n 126 38 e fig 1 the second dataset was the phenology and yield data at agricultural meteorological stations of the chinese meteorological administration cma archives 2010 including 43 phenological stations and 41 yield stations fig 1 these stations have uniform observing guidelines and standards of cma for collecting phenology and crop yield data cma archives 2010 liu et al 2012 there are 691 688 and 606 observed samples for planting date pd harvesting date hd and growing period gp from 1993 to 2010 and 377 observations for maize yield from 1999 to 2010 respectively the third dataset was the annual county yield data from the national bureau of statistics of china nbsc which was collected by local investigators from field sampling using uniform agricultural production sampling survey system across the county national bureau of statistics of china nbsc 2011 in this study yield data for 174 counties and 20 years 1991 2010 were used to validate the areas of these counties range from 740 to 55 096 km2 with a median of 4268 km2 the total study is 131 104 km2 corresponding to 606 grid cells 0 5 resolution so that most counties were represented by one to four grid cells the correlation coefficient r and the root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate model performance eqs 2 and 3

represent the means and n is the number of samples if r is close to 1 it suggests that the model performs well the rmse is calculated as the standard deviation of the residuals against a 1 1 relation so that rmse close to 0 means good performance 3 results 3 1 lai and plant carbon observation data of the hailun site in 2005 and 2007 was used to validate the simulated lai and plant carbon against modelled values for the grid cell where the hailun site is located center of pixel 47 25 n 126 75 e simulated lines and observed asterisks lai are shown in fig 3 a d clm crop generally overestimated lai during the growing period in these two years the average correlation coefficient was 0 41 and the average rmse was 2 47 previous studies have also observed overestimated lai in clm3 5 crop drewniak et al 2013 and clm4 5 crop because simulated leaf emergence was earlier chen et al 2015 peng et al 2018 fig 3 a d shows that the simulated lai reached a maximum more quickly than observation and before leaf senescence the simulated lai maintained constant maximum lai peng et al 2018 in addition the lai in the model is calculated using a fixed value for specific leaf area sla the ratio of leaf area to dry leaf weight but sla actually varies in the growth period drewniak et al 2013 tardieu et al 1999 this is also the possible reason of overestimated lai fig 3 b c e f shows the simulated and observed plant carbon overall both the leaf and stem carbon were underestimated by the clm crop model the average correlation coefficients and rmses were 0 38 and 84 72 g c m 2 for leaf carbon and 0 46 and 44 18 g c m 2 for stem the maximum simulated leaf and stem carbon were only 100 10 g c m 2 and 68 25 g c m 2 respectively which were much lower than the maximum observed value 182 50 and 104 40 g c m 2 respectively the simulated leaf and stem carbon increased fast during the early growing period and reached maximum values one month earlier than the observations it is worth noting that in the clm crop when the prescribed maximum lai is reached all available carbon is allocated from above ground components e g leaf stem to roots but there is little theoretical basis for this approach peng et al 2018 3 2 phenology the simulated planting and harvesting dates as well as the length of growing period were compared with observation data from 43 agricultural meteorological stations from 1993 to 2010 in general the median values for simulations and observations were close the simulated dates were all slightly later than observation values for planting and harvesting date and longer for growing period fig 4 the simulated values had larger ranges than observation values especially for harvesting dates the simulation results for planting dates were better than those for harvesting dates the correlation coefficients between simulation and observation was 0 53 rmse 9 22 days for planting dates and 0 20 rmse 18 72 days for harvesting dates for growing periods the correlation coefficient was only 0 04 rmse 17 34 days fig 5 shows the differences between mean simulated and observed planting harvesting dates and growing period in the 43 agricultural meteorological stations about 70 of the stations had differences within one week between the simulated and observed planting dates fig 5a for harvesting dates fig 5b about 60 of the stations had differences within one week those sites with small differences were mainly distributed in the middle plain region of northeast china for both planting and harvesting dates fig 5a b for planting dates the simulation dates were later than the actual dates in the east part of the region while the opposite is the case in the southwest part for harvesting dates the simulation dates were later than observation values in most of the sites except for those in the middle plain region several harvest dates were severely overestimated up to one month for growing periods about 42 of the stations were underestimated which were mainly distributed in the middle plain region the overestimated stations were mainly distributed in the surrounding mountainous areas fig 5c part of the discrepancy is because in the clm crop the planting date and harvesting date are determined only by temperature section 2 2 but in practice they are determined by farmers choice and operational limitations sacks et al 2010 3 3 yields fig 6 shows the comparison between simulated and observed maize yields over northeast china observation data from 41 agricultural meteorological stations from 1999 to 2010 a total of 377 observations were used for validation simulated yields ranged from 993 to 13 905 kg ha mean 9066 while the observed yields ranged from 1184 to 14 978 kg ha mean 8561 thus a fairly close match with simulated mean yield slightly larger than observed mean yield at county level the statistical yield from 174 counties 1991 2010 2620 samples were used for validation the simulated yields ranged from 317 to 14 880 kg ha mean 9091 and the observed yields ranged from 150 to 15 920 kg ha mean 6098 the mean simulated yield was much larger than the mean county statistical yield fig 7 a shows a scatterplot of clm crop simulated and observed maize yields at the station level which indicates a poor correlation between simulation and observation r 0 15 rmse 4036 kg ha however the simulation and observation values had much better correlation r 0 26 rmse 4213 kg ha at the county level although there was an overall overestimation fig 7b some reported county yields exceed the corresponding model simulations this may be due to over optimistic or unrepresentative reporting the overall overestimation is typical of simulated vs farmer yields it is well known that a major cause of mismatch between simulated and actual yields is because of management decisions by individual farmers including sub optimal timing of farming operations inappropriate variety selection and poor weed and pest control many studies compensate for this by a so called yield bias correction as a typical example jagtap and jones 2002 computed these corrections for a 17 year period in their study of regional yields of soybeans simulated by the cropgro model and found that these were in the range of 0 4 0 5 in about three quarters of the 58 0 5 resolution grid cells covering georgia usa so we were not surprised that the median county average yield of 6055 kg ha is about 40 below the median simulated county yield of 9573 kg ha fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of simulated a and statistical b average maize yield from 1991 to 2010 and their differences c at the county level the simulated result fig 8a shows maize yield decreasing from the southeast to the northwest corresponding mainly to shorter growing seasons however the statistical average yield shows a different spatial pattern fig 8b the areas with high yields were mainly concentrated in the south part of the songnei plain labelled a in fig 1 followed by other plain areas and low yields were mainly distributed in surrounding mountainous areas in most counties the simulated yields were larger than statistical yields fig 8c with the highest differences occurring in the south east mountainous areas 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties and limitations of simulated phenology phenology simulation plays an important role in modeling crop growth and planting date is a basic variable in phenology simulation bilionis et al 2015 deryng et al 2011 sacks et al 2010 waha et al 2012 drewniak et al 2013 indicated that planting date is one of the most sensitive variables in clm crop which has substantial influence on growth period and the resulting carbon fluxes in the middle plains region of northeast china the simulated planting dates agree well with observations but in surrounding mountainous areas the simulated planting dates were about two weeks later than observations fig 5 this may be because in complex terrains in northern latitudes most cropland may be located in valleys or on south facing slopes to take advantage of warmer conditions as the maize growing areas are concentrated in plains other than in mountains the low performance in mountainous areas may not have much negative impacts but in order to obtain more reasonable spatial distribution of phenology and yield it is still necessary to improve the parameterization of clm crop in regions with complex terrain either by increasing the resolution of the climate data set or adjusting it according to cropland distribution within each grid in clm crop the planting date is calculated according to crop specific temperature thresholds i e the coldest temperatures at which planting can occur when t10d is greater than 10 and t10d min is greater than 6 maize can be planted however the actual planting dates recorded for the 43 stations show that the temperature thresholds of planting are not fixed but vary spatially the spatial distribution of actual t10d and t10d min which were calculated based on observation planting dates from 43 stations 1993 2010 are shown in fig 9 in most of the phenology stations the actual t10d was less than 10 fig 9a and the actual t10d min was more than 6 fig 9b it suggests that the temperature thresholds of planting are variable in different place perhaps because of different varieties or microclimate and it is unreasonable that the fixed temperature thresholds were used in clm crop at regional or global scale therefore this is likely to constitute one source of error in modeling phenology planting date is usually determined by farmers choice not only considering temperature but also precipitation soil moisture cultivar variety agronomic technologies and other conditions favorable for growth kucharik 2006 sacks et al 2010 so the threshold of planting is triggered not only by the temperature but also by the terrain human activities such as farming practices and other factors it is necessary to improve the understanding of crop phenology and develop gridded crop parameters to improve the model performance at the regional or global scale 4 2 uncertainties and limitations of simulated yield of maize in this study station level observed yields and the county level statistical yields were used to validate the simulation results of clm crop although the average simulated maize yield was close in absolute terms rmse to station level observations the correlation between simulated and observed yield was very poor fig 7a at the county level the simulated and statistical yields had much better correlation although there was an overall overestimation fig 7b the poor correlation between simulated and observed maize yield at the station level may be related to scale mismatch in this study clm crop was run at a resolution of 0 5 0 5 which cannot be represented by a single station except in very uniform agricultural landscapes at the county level the scales of simulated and statistical yields were more consistent because a county covers one or several grid cells so the county statistical yields can to some extent represent a regional ground truth and are more suitable for the validation of simulated crop yields chen et al 2011 mo et al 2005 yao et al 2015 crop yields are seriously affected by the temperature precipitation and agricultural management practices such as tillage weed control and irrigation to investigate the extent to which these factors may have affected the yield discrepancies we used the mean temperature and precipitation as factors to analyze the relationship between these factors and simulated or statistical yield the mean temperature and precipitation during the maize growing season april through october were averaged over 1991 2010 the mean temperature and precipitation are independent variables fig 10 a b shows the spatial distribution of mean temperature and precipitation fig 10 c d show scatterplots of statistical and simulated yields for each county with best fit polynomial regression equations selected by adjusted r2 and akaike information criterion aic the spatial distribution of simulated yields was consistent with that of temperature and precipitation fig 8a fig 10a b with the obvious positive bias of simulated yields discussed above and a slightly stronger response to temperature steeper slope doubled r2 for simulated yields this suggests that clm crop can well capture the effect of the temperature however the relation with precipitation is not monotonic fig 10d especially for the statistical yields for simulated yields when the precipitation increased to about 750 mm the simulated yield reaches the maximum value and slightly decreases this is interpreted as a threshold effect where precipitation is no longer the limiting factor but for statistical yields when the precipitation increased to 500 mm the statistical yield reaches the maximum value and then decreases although because of the scatter and fairly few observations with such high precipitation this may also be a threshold effect but at a lower yield threshold this may be because limitations in farmer management is not able to take full advantage of the available precipitation also striking is that the fitted polynomial is much steeper at low to medium precipitations for the simulated as opposed to statistical yields this also suggests that farmer practice is not taking full advantage of available precipitation perhaps because of weed competition or improper planting densities drewniak et al 2013 noted that the simulated yields from clm crop have a strong positive correlation with precipitation consistent with our results for simulated yields accordingly in the south of northeast china with the precipitation of about 800 mm the simulated maize yield is more than other areas fig 10b fig 8a which is a serious overestimation on the contrary in the middle plain areas with moderate precipitation the simulated yields were comparable with statistical yields taking into account the overall bias explained above in sum clm crop can capture the effect of the temperature and precipitation on crop yields the impact of precipitation on actual yields was exaggerated in clm crop it is necessary to adjust clm crop to properly reflect the influence of precipitation taking into account other factors that reduce the effect of precipitation on yield as fig 10d shows this is not simply a bias adjustment as just mentioned management could be the reason for much of the disagreement between simulated and statistical yields this include uncertainties in the clm crop management practices for example in clm crop fixed fertilizer rates and higher fertilizer than typically used in cultivation will lead to overestimated yields leng et al 2016 therefore for realistic application gridded crop management parameters should be developed based on field or statistical surveys to determine which cultivars are grown what fertilizers are used etc at the resolution of the clm crop grid one example is that potter et al 2010 who established the spatial distribution of global fertilizer application by crop type using fertilizer datasets 5 conclusion as a state of the art process based land surface model clm crop is designed to be applied at a single site region scale or global scale in this study we evaluated the clm crop through validating for lais plant carbons phenology and yields over the northeast china and proposed possible improvements despite overall good results clm crop overestimated lais and underestimated leaf and stem carbon for maize for simulation of phenology and yield the clm crop performed well in the middle plain areas in the mountains areas the performance of clm crop should be improved by increasing the resolution of the climate and surface dataset to better characterize the climate and terrain conditions of crop growing areas the county level statistical yields better corresponded to the simulated spatial pattern of yields than station level perhaps because clm crop was run with 0 5 resolution climate information and not at near point resolution corresponding to experiment stations clm crop was able to capture the effect of the temperature on crop yields but clm crop excessively considered the effect of precipitation on crop yields especially in moderately high precipitation areas if clm crop is applied to scenarios such as extreme climate events especially heavy precipitation this result could be amplified thus the following improvements could be made to clm crop to give more realistic results in northeast china 1 in complex terrains it is necessary to consider the impacts of microclimate on crop phenology and yield 2 clm crop should be adjusted to properly reflect the influence of precipitation on yield 3 gridded crop specific phenological and management parameters should be developed in order to improve the model performance at

25299,climate change has significant impacts on crop yields and could greatly affect global food security as an advanced process based land surface model the community land model clm includes a comprehensive crop model clm crop which aims to simulate crop growth globally although this model has been evaluated in the united states it is not clear whether it can be applied successfully in other parts of the world in this study we evaluate the applicability of clm crop for maize growth simulation in northeast china one of the major agricultural production areas in china simulated lai plant carbon phenology and yields of maize were compared with observations at agricultural experiment and meteorological stations and with statistical reports the clm crop model overestimated lai and underestimated leaf and stem carbon during the growing period planting and harvesting dates were overestimated in the eastern part of the study area but underestimated in the southern part correlation r 0 26 between simulated and reported yield was poor yields were generally overestimated especially in the east and south parts which may be due to imperfect farming practices on working farms some parameters including temperature thresholds of planting and crop management parameters have spatial heterogeneity rather than the default fixed parameters in clm crop development of gridded crop

introduction climate change may significantly affect crop yields and therefore global food security peng et al 2004 rosenzweig et al 2014 schlenker and roberts 2009 numerous studies have shown that climate change such as increasing temperature and frequency and severity of extreme climate events may have substantial effects on crop growth and yield actions must therefore be taken to adapt agriculture to climate change deryng et al 2014 lobell et al 2014 2012 osborne et al 2009 siebert et al 2014 in order to make correct decisions for agricultural adaptation crop yield prediction under climate change scenarios is key information intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2007 piao et al 2010 wang et al 2011 yao et al 2015 crop yields under climate change are commonly predicted by two approaches 1 empirical statistical models bondeau et al 2007 fader et al 2010 and 2 process based crop models liu et al 2007 yao et al 2015 empirical statistical models use regression or machine learning methods to establish the relationships between crop yield and climate variables based on historical observations ed et al 2013 hoffman et al 2018 lobell and ortizmonasterio 2007 these models are then extrapolated to plausible scenarios these models are relatively straightforward and easy to construct but they usually use temporally aggregated climate data they may thus miss important heterogeneities and may fail to capture the details of interactions between climate change and crop growth he et al 2015 hoffman et al 2018 lobell and asseng 2017 process based crop models dynamically simulate the key biophysical and biochemical processes of crop growth usually on a daily time step so they better reflect the details of the climate and can represent the complex relationships between crop growth and climate change estes et al 2013 lobell and asseng 2017 roudier et al 2011 zhao et al 2013 in the early stage of their development process based crop models were applied at the field scale where environment factors can be considered homogeneous jones et al 2003 keating et al 2003 williams et al 1989 i e represented by a single climate station in order to assess the effect of climate change on crop growth over larger areas some regional or global scale crop models emerged bondeau et al 2007 kucharik and brye 2003 levis 2010 zhang et al 2016 the community land model clm is one of the most widely used land surface models and has incorporated a comprehensive crop model named clm crop levis et al 2012 which aims to simulate crop growth globally this is helpful for predicting the impacts of climate change on agriculture over the world however the calibration and evaluation of clm crop was only conducted in united state bilionis et al 2015 chen et al 2015 drewniak et al 2013 2015 leng et al 2016 levis et al 2012 due to complex environment and human activities factors it is not clear whether clm crop as a global scale crop model can be applied successful in other regions of the world in this study we evaluate clm crop for maize growth simulation in northeast china which is a commodity grain base with strategic role in china the maize yield of this region accounts for 27 of china s total maize growing area and over 30 of its total yield national bureau of statistics of china nbsc 2011 guo et al 2013 therefore it is necessary to evaluate the suitability of clm crop for maize growth modelling in this region in order to perform a reasonable global simulation in this paper section 2 presents the descriptions of the study area

study area northeast china is located between 115 0 135 0 e 38 9 53 0 n including heilongjiang jilin liaoning provinces and the east part of inner mongolia autonomous region the northeast plain in this region is the largest plain of china and consists of the songnen liao river and sanjiang plains fig 1 more than 90 of maize ﬁelds are rain fed national bureau of statistics of china nbsc 2011 climate is largely controlled by the east asian monsoon which is characterized by warm and short summers cold and dry winters the mean annual air temperature is 4 2 10 9 and the annual accumulated temperature above 10 is 1700 3600 with the frost free period normally 155 257 days yao et al 2015 yin et al 2016 the annual precipitation ranges from 400 to 1000 mm and is mainly concentrated between july and september chen et al 2012 the principal soils of northeast china are chernozems mainly in the central section luvisols mainly in the east cambisols in the western mountain ranges and podzols in the far north institute of soil sciences 1990 according to the world reference base for soil resources classification fao 2014 2 2 model setup clm crop is a part of the community earth system model cesm dickinson et al 2006 lawrence et al 2011 the current version clm 4 5 includes the simulation of spring wheat maize and soybean which are represented as managed crop plant functional types pfts the crop growth module in clm crop is based on the agroibis model kucharik and brye 2003 a well known dynamic vegetation model crop growth is divided into planting emergence grain filling and harvest phases the latter three phases are determined by the fraction of accumulated phenological heat units fphus drewniak et al 2013 needed to achieve the respective phase planting date is determined by the 10 day running mean t10d and minimum t10d min 2 m air temperature at every daily time step during the emergence phase carbon and nitrogen are allocated to leaves stems and roots and lai gradually increases and finally reaches its maximum which is prescribed constraints in clm crop a maximum lai at 5 0 m2 m 2 during the grain fill phase the carbon accumulated in the leaves stems and roots is reduced by translocation to the grain harvest occurs when the growing degree days gdd are equal to the growing degree days necessary for the crop to reach physiological maturity gddmat eq 1 shows how gddmat is calculated by clm crop 1 gddmat 0 85 gdd8 where gdd8 is the 20 year running mean of accumulated gdd from april to september in the northern hemisphere base 8 the maximum daily increments of 30 days gddmat is bounded from 950 to 1850 days so the growing period length can change over time detailed descriptions of clm crop can be found in oleson et al 2013 the input data of clm crop are of two main types meteorological forcing data and surface data the meteorological forcing data provided by the combined climatic research unit and national center for environment predication cruncep dataset for 1901 2010 include solar radiation temperature precipitation wind speed humidity and surface pressure at 6 hour intervals viovy 2011 the cruncep dataset is a combination of two datasets which are the cru ts3 2 0 5 0 5 grid resolution monthly data 1901 2002 mitchell and jones 2005 and the ncep reanalysis 2 5 2 5 grid resolution 6 hourly data 1948 2010 kalnay et al 1996 this dataset has been used to force clm for numerous studies of evapotranspiration vegetation growth and gross primary production mao et al 2013 2012 shi et al 2013 considering the computational load of the model the resolution of the crunep dataset in this study clm crop was run at a resolution of 0 5 0 5 approximately 2180 km2 at 45 n latitude resulting in 606 pixels for the period of 1991 2010 in clm crop surface datasets assign the fractions of land types and pfts in each grid cell crops are represented as unmanaged and managed crop pfts each crop has its own soil column and each soil column has its own carbon and nitrogen pools crops can coexist with natural vegetation in a grid cell but they do not compete with natural vegetation for resources drewniak et al 2013 the unmanaged crop dataset was derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis satellite data lawrence and chase 2007 at 0 05 the managed crop dataset in clm crop was obtained from the present day crop dataset of portmann et al 2010 which provides the global distribution and area of crops at 5 arc min for consistency with the unmanaged crop dataset modis based 0 05 i e 3 the managed crop dataset 5 was resampled to 0 05 by bilinear interpolation the managed crop pfts were then assigned based on the managed crop dataset and unmanaged crop dataset for each grid leng et al 2016 finally the land surface dataset was aggregated to the 0 5 grid resolution by summation the distribution of fractions of the maize growing area prescribed in the clm crop model is shown in fig 2 before the real simulations an accelerated spin up procedure thornton and rosenbloom 2005 was used during spin up clm crop was run offline from 1991 to 2010 with cn cycling active in order to ensure that the soil carbon and nitrogen pools reached a steady state the forcing data were recycled 50 times a total of 1000 years after spin up the resulting state variables were used to initialize subsequent simulations then the clm crop was run for 16 complete cycles of the 1991 2010 climate data a total of 320 years the last 20 years of simulation one cycle of 1991 2010 was used for analysis with daily averaged data 2 3 evaluation of model performance three observational and statistical datasets were used to validate the simulation results the first dataset was the observation data of lai and plant carbon of maize in the state key agroecological experiment station hailun county heilongjiang province china 47 26 n 126 38 e fig 1 the second dataset was the phenology and yield data at agricultural meteorological stations of the chinese meteorological administration cma archives 2010 including 43 phenological stations and 41 yield stations fig 1 these stations have uniform observing guidelines and standards of cma for collecting phenology and crop yield data cma archives 2010 liu et al 2012 there are 691 688 and 606 observed samples for planting date pd harvesting date hd and growing period gp from 1993 to 2010 and 377 observations for maize yield from 1999 to 2010 respectively the third dataset was the annual county yield data from the national bureau of statistics of china nbsc which was collected by local investigators from field sampling using uniform agricultural production sampling survey system across the county national bureau of statistics of china nbsc 2011 in this study yield data for 174 counties and 20 years 1991 2010 were used to validate the areas of these counties range from 740 to 55 096 km2 with a median of 4268 km2 the total study is 131 104 km2 corresponding to 606 grid cells 0 5 resolution so that most counties were represented by one to four grid cells the correlation coefficient r and the root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate model performance eqs 2 and 3 schaefer et al 2012 2 r i 1 n y i ˆ y ˆ y i y i 1 n y i ˆ y ˆ 2 i 1 n y i y 2 3 r m s e i 1 n y i ˆ y i 2 n where y i is the observed or statistical values y i ˆ is the simulated values the overbars represent the means and n is the number of samples if r is close to 1 it suggests that the model performs well the rmse is calculated as the standard deviation of the residuals against a 1 1 relation so that rmse close to 0 means good performance 3 results 3 1 lai and plant carbon observation data of the hailun site in 2005 and 2007 was used to validate the simulated lai and plant carbon against modelled values for the grid cell where the hailun site is located center of pixel 47 25 n 126 75 e simulated lines and observed asterisks lai are shown in fig 3 a d clm crop generally overestimated lai during the growing period in these two years the average correlation coefficient was 0 41 and the average rmse was 2 47 previous studies have also observed overestimated lai in clm3 5 crop drewniak et al 2013 and clm4 5 crop because simulated leaf emergence was earlier chen et al 2015 peng et al 2018 fig 3 a d shows that the simulated lai reached a maximum more quickly than observation and before leaf senescence the simulated lai maintained constant maximum lai peng et al 2018 in addition the lai in the model is calculated using a fixed value for specific leaf area sla the ratio of leaf area to dry leaf weight but sla actually varies in the growth period drewniak et al 2013 tardieu et al 1999 this is also the possible reason of overestimated lai fig 3 b c e f shows the simulated and observed plant carbon overall both the leaf and stem carbon were underestimated by the clm crop model the average correlation coefficients and rmses were 0 38 and 84 72 g c m 2 for leaf carbon and 0 46 and 44 18 g c m 2 for stem the maximum simulated leaf and stem carbon were only 100 10 g c m 2 and 68 25 g c m 2 respectively which were much lower than the maximum observed value 182 50 and 104 40 g c m 2 respectively the simulated leaf and stem carbon increased fast during the early growing period and reached maximum values one month earlier than the observations it is worth noting that in the clm crop when the prescribed maximum lai is reached all available carbon is allocated from above ground components e g leaf stem to roots but there is little theoretical basis for this approach peng et al 2018 3 2 phenology the simulated planting and harvesting dates as well as the length of growing period were compared with observation data from 43 agricultural meteorological stations from 1993 to 2010 in general the median values for simulations and observations were close the simulated dates were all slightly later than observation values for planting and harvesting date and longer for growing period fig 4 the simulated values had larger ranges than observation values especially for harvesting dates the simulation results for planting dates were better than those for harvesting dates the correlation coefficients between simulation and observation was 0 53 rmse 9 22 days for planting dates and 0 20 rmse 18 72 days for harvesting dates for growing periods the correlation coefficient was only 0 04 rmse 17 34 days fig 5 shows the differences between mean simulated and observed planting harvesting dates and growing period in the 43 agricultural meteorological stations about 70 of the stations had differences within one week between the simulated and observed planting dates fig 5a for harvesting dates fig 5b about 60 of the stations had differences within one week those sites with small differences were mainly distributed in the middle plain region of northeast china for both planting and harvesting dates fig 5a b for planting dates the simulation dates were later than the actual dates in the east part of the region while the opposite is the case in the southwest part for harvesting dates the simulation dates were later than observation values in most of the sites except for those in the middle plain region several harvest dates were severely overestimated up to one month for growing periods about 42 of the stations were underestimated which were mainly distributed in the middle plain region the overestimated stations were mainly distributed in the surrounding mountainous areas fig 5c part of the discrepancy is because in the clm crop the planting date and harvesting date are determined only by temperature section 2 2 but in practice they are determined by farmers choice and operational limitations sacks et al 2010 3 3 yields fig 6 shows the comparison between simulated and observed maize yields over northeast china observation data from 41 agricultural meteorological stations from 1999 to 2010 a total of 377 observations were used for validation simulated yields ranged from 993 to 13 905 kg ha mean 9066 while the observed yields ranged from 1184 to 14 978 kg ha mean 8561 thus a fairly close match with simulated mean yield slightly larger than observed mean yield at county level the statistical yield from 174 counties 1991 2010 2620 samples were used for validation the simulated yields ranged from 317 to 14 880 kg ha mean 9091 and the observed yields ranged from 150 to 15 920 kg ha mean 6098 the mean simulated yield was much larger than the mean county statistical yield fig 7 a shows a scatterplot of clm crop simulated and observed maize yields at the station level which indicates a poor correlation between simulation and observation r 0 15 rmse 4036 kg ha however the simulation and observation values had much better correlation r 0 26 rmse 4213 kg ha at the county level although there was an overall overestimation fig 7b some reported county yields exceed the corresponding model simulations this may be due to over optimistic or unrepresentative reporting the overall overestimation is typical of simulated vs farmer yields it is well known that a major cause of mismatch between simulated and actual yields is because of management decisions by individual farmers including sub optimal timing of farming operations inappropriate variety selection and poor weed and pest control many studies compensate for this by a so called yield bias correction as a typical example jagtap and jones 2002 computed these corrections for a 17 year period in their study of regional yields of soybeans simulated by the cropgro model and found that these were in the range of 0 4 0 5 in about three quarters of the 58 0 5 resolution grid cells covering georgia usa so we were not surprised that the median county average yield of 6055 kg ha is about 40 below the median simulated county yield of 9573 kg ha fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of simulated a and statistical b average maize yield from 1991 to 2010 and their differences c at the county level the simulated result fig 8a shows maize yield decreasing from the southeast to the northwest corresponding mainly to shorter growing seasons however the statistical average yield shows a different spatial pattern fig 8b the areas with high yields were mainly concentrated in the south part of the songnei plain labelled a in fig 1 followed by other plain areas and low yields were mainly distributed in surrounding mountainous areas in most counties the simulated yields were larger than statistical yields fig 8c with the highest differences occurring in the south east mountainous areas 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties and limitations of simulated phenology phenology simulation plays an important role in modeling crop growth and planting date is a basic variable in phenology simulation bilionis et al 2015 deryng et al 2011 sacks et al 2010 waha et al 2012 drewniak et al 2013 indicated that planting date is one of the most sensitive variables in clm crop which has substantial influence on growth period and the resulting carbon fluxes in the middle plains region of northeast china the simulated planting dates agree well with observations but in surrounding mountainous areas the simulated planting dates were about two weeks later than observations fig 5 this may be because in complex terrains in northern latitudes most cropland may be located in valleys or on south facing slopes to take advantage of warmer conditions as the maize growing areas are concentrated in plains other than in mountains the low performance in mountainous areas may not have much negative impacts but in order to obtain more reasonable spatial distribution of phenology and yield it is still necessary to improve the parameterization of clm crop in regions with complex terrain either by increasing the resolution of the climate data set or adjusting it according to cropland distribution within each grid in clm crop the planting date is calculated according to crop specific temperature thresholds i e the coldest temperatures at which planting can occur when t10d is greater than 10 and t10d min is greater than 6 maize can be planted however the actual planting dates recorded for the 43 stations show that the temperature thresholds of planting are not fixed but vary spatially the spatial distribution of actual t10d and t10d min which were calculated based on observation planting dates from 43 stations 1993 2010 are shown in fig 9 in most of the phenology stations the actual t10d was less than 10 fig 9a and the actual t10d min was more than 6 fig 9b it suggests that the temperature thresholds of planting are variable in different place perhaps because of different varieties or microclimate and it is unreasonable that the fixed temperature thresholds were used in clm crop at regional or global scale therefore this is likely to constitute one source of error in modeling phenology planting date is usually determined by farmers choice not only considering temperature but also precipitation soil moisture cultivar variety agronomic technologies and other conditions favorable for growth kucharik 2006 sacks et al 2010 so the threshold of planting is triggered not only by the temperature but also by the terrain human activities such as farming practices and other factors it is necessary to improve the understanding of crop phenology and develop gridded crop parameters to improve the model performance at the regional or global scale 4 2 uncertainties and limitations of simulated yield of maize in this study station level observed yields and the county level statistical yields were used to validate the simulation results of clm crop although the average simulated maize yield was close in absolute terms rmse to station level observations the correlation between simulated and observed yield was very poor fig 7a at the county level the simulated and statistical yields had much better correlation although there was an overall overestimation fig 7b the poor correlation between simulated and observed maize yield at the station level may be related to scale mismatch in this study clm crop was run at a resolution of 0 5 0 5 which cannot be represented by a single station except in very uniform agricultural landscapes at the county level the scales of simulated and statistical yields were more consistent because a county covers one or several grid cells so the county statistical yields can to some extent represent a regional ground truth and are more suitable for the validation of simulated crop yields chen et al 2011 mo et al 2005 yao et al 2015 crop yields are seriously affected by the temperature precipitation and agricultural management practices such as tillage weed control and irrigation to investigate the extent to which these factors may have affected the yield discrepancies we used the mean temperature and precipitation as factors to analyze the relationship between these factors and simulated or statistical yield the mean temperature and precipitation during the maize growing season april through october were averaged over 1991 2010 the mean temperature and precipitation are independent variables fig 10 a b shows the spatial distribution of mean temperature and precipitation fig 10 c d show scatterplots of statistical and simulated yields for each county with best fit polynomial regression equations selected by adjusted r2 and akaike information criterion aic the spatial distribution of simulated yields was consistent with that of temperature and precipitation fig 8a fig 10a b with the obvious positive bias of simulated yields discussed above and a slightly stronger response to temperature steeper slope doubled r2 for simulated yields this suggests that clm crop can well capture the effect of the temperature however the relation with precipitation is not monotonic fig 10d especially for the statistical yields for simulated yields when the precipitation increased to about 750 mm the simulated yield reaches the maximum value and slightly decreases this is interpreted as a threshold effect where precipitation is no longer the limiting factor but for statistical yields when the precipitation increased to 500 mm the statistical yield reaches the maximum value and then decreases although because of the scatter and fairly few observations with such high precipitation this may also be a threshold effect but at a lower yield threshold this may be because limitations in farmer management is not able to take full advantage of the available precipitation also striking is that the fitted polynomial is much steeper at low to medium precipitations for the simulated as opposed to statistical yields this also suggests that farmer practice is not taking full advantage of available precipitation perhaps because of weed competition or improper planting densities drewniak et al 2013 noted that the simulated yields from clm crop have a strong positive correlation with precipitation consistent with our results for simulated yields accordingly in the south of northeast china with the precipitation of about 800 mm the simulated maize yield is more than other areas fig 10b fig 8a which is a serious overestimation on the contrary in the middle plain areas with moderate precipitation the simulated yields were comparable with statistical yields taking into account the overall bias explained above in sum clm crop can capture the effect of the temperature and precipitation on crop yields the impact of precipitation on actual yields was exaggerated in clm crop it is necessary to adjust clm crop to properly reflect the influence of precipitation taking into account other factors that reduce the effect of precipitation on yield as fig 10d shows this is not simply a bias adjustment as just mentioned management could be the reason for much of the disagreement between simulated and statistical yields this include uncertainties in the clm crop management practices for example in clm crop fixed fertilizer rates and higher fertilizer than typically used in cultivation will lead to overestimated yields leng et al 2016 therefore for realistic application gridded crop management parameters should be developed based on field or statistical surveys to determine which cultivars are grown what fertilizers are used etc at the resolution of the clm crop grid one example is that potter et al 2010 who established the spatial distribution of global fertilizer application by crop type using fertilizer datasets 5 conclusion as a state of the art process based land surface model clm crop is designed to be applied at a single site region scale or global scale in this study we evaluated the clm crop through validating for lais plant carbons phenology and yields over the northeast china and proposed possible improvements despite overall good results clm crop overestimated lais and underestimated leaf and stem carbon for maize for simulation of phenology and yield the clm crop performed well in the middle plain areas in the mountains areas the performance of clm crop should be improved by increasing the resolution of the climate and surface dataset to better characterize the climate and terrain conditions of crop growing areas the county level statistical yields better corresponded to the simulated spatial pattern of yields than station level perhaps because clm crop was run with 0 5 resolution climate information and not at near point resolution corresponding to experiment stations clm crop was able to capture the effect of the temperature on crop yields but clm crop excessively considered the effect of precipitation on crop yields especially in moderately high precipitation areas if clm crop is applied to scenarios such as extreme climate events especially heavy precipitation this result could be amplified thus the following improvements could be made to clm crop to give more realistic results in northeast china 1 in complex terrains it is necessary to consider the impacts of microclimate on crop phenology and yield 2 clm crop should be adjusted to properly reflect the influence of precipitation on yield 3 gridded crop specific phenological and management parameters should be developed in order to improve the model performance at
