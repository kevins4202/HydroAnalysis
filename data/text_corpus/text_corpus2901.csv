14505,a rigorous model based on the numerical simulation of one dimensional unsteady of advection dispersion adsorption equation uadae solved by the implicit finite difference method ifdm has been employed to simulate the dynamic adsorption of cd ii ions on ostrich bone ash oba nanoscale zerovalent iron particles nzvi composite oba nzvi in a fixed bed column system the accuracy of the numerical model was assessed by employing three criteria mean residual error mre normalized root mean square error nrmse and coefficient of determination r2 the numerical model tracked the observed values very closely r2 0 9698 it was found that the numerical model had the excellent performance to simulate breakthrough curves btc nrmse 7 66 and it tended to overestimate the btc very slightly mre 0 0029 the sensitivity analysis indicated that the axial dispersion coefficient d had more significant impact on the column dynamic simulation therefore it is possible to describe the adsorption process for wastewater treatment systems in a more cost effective and easier way with the suggested model application the results obtained from sem and xrd analyses confirmed that the oba nzvi composite preserved its capabilities even after one year of storage under room conditions the results also obtained from xps technique confirmed that the removal mechanism of cd ii ions which have the standard reduction potential very close to that of fe is the sorption surface complex formation without reduction of cd ii to cd by nzvi keywords breakthrough curves cadmium adsorption numerical model advection dispersion adsorption finite difference method 1 introduction cadmium mainly in the state of ionic is one of the most inorganic pollutants which can cause adverse effects on plants animals and humans hypertension kidneys disease liver failure bone damage and lung insufficiency are the main harmful health effects of cd ii on the humans 1 for instance in 1995 the existence of high cd ii concentrations in rice caused the itai itai disease in japan 2 effluents from several industries including stabilizers paint pigments metal plating silver cadmium batteries plastics ceramic and mining are the main source of cadmium pollution 3 the admissible amount of cd ii ions in drinking water domestic wastewater and industrial effluents are 0 005 0 001 0 004 and 0 1 0 2 mg l 1 respectively as defined by the environmental protection agency epa 4 thus the removal of cd ii ions from contaminated wastewaters is necessary not only to preserve the human health but also for the conservation of the water resources adsorption process has been considered to be more important as compared with other classical wastewater treatments like electrochemical membrane processes chemical precipitation evaporation and filtration for the cd ii removal in terms of high efficiency low cost and flexibility of design 1 5 7 among other adsorbents animal bone wastes which are composed by hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 6 oh 2 have been broadly used for the removal of several heavy metals due to the high efficiency natural abundance and relatively inexpensive 5 8 9 every year in iran as the third country for production and breeding of ostrich meat 10 around 120 000 150 000 ostriches are slaughtered and a large amount of bone wastes are generated which can be used for wastewater treatment instead of commercial adsorbents in previous studies it is successfully examined the potential use of ostrich bone wastes as adsorbents under several forms for the removal of pb ii and hg ii ions 9 11 13 and also methyl orange 14 ostrich bone ash oba as a cheap and abundant adsorbent has an excellent capability for elimination inorganic cations 12 15 however oba has limited application because of the difficulty to recycling and separation 16 to resolve this drawback nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi has been used to combine oba 15 16 which can be separated using an external magnetic field without filtration and centrifugation poor mechanical strength aggregation and low durability of uncoated nzvi are the major problems of these nanoparticles in groundwater remediation 17 19 which can be solved by immobilization of nzvi on porous materials to enhance the stability during the adsorption process however most researches of entrapped nzvi in biomaterial beads are confined to batch experiment mode 17 22 from the practical point of view the continuous adsorption in a packed bed column system is favorable due to the high grade of flexibility reliability and stability at several operational conditions such as influent concentration bed depth flow rate ph temperature among other parameters the efficiency of a fixed bed column system is evaluated from the breakthrough curve a breakthrough curve is acquired by plotting effluent concentration versus time of treatment for a constant flow rate the prediction of breakthrough curve is essential to control and design of the dynamic adsorption process hence btc can be predicted by several mathematical empirical equations including thomas 1944 pandit et al 2001 yan et al 2001 agrios et al 2003 and yavuz and koparal 2006 23 27 in general these analytical methods are appropriate to characterize the fixed bed adsorption process with a symmetrical btc constant pattern solution however the performance of these equations is diminished for describing the fixed bed columns adsorption process with an unsymmetrical btc complex adsorption process 28 adsorption isotherms diffusion characteristics and flow rate determine the shape of the mass transfer zone concave upward unfavorable isotherms give proportionate patterns whereas convex upward favorable isotherms achieve constant pattern in proportionate patterns namely equilibrium limited model the width of the mass transfer zone increases in direct proportion to the distance traveled through the column the constant pattern which has the constant mass transfer zone breadth provides analytical solutions or simplified mass transfer equations 29 30 nowadays application of artificial intelligence methods such as artificial neural networks 28 31 35 has been successfully developed to predict the performance of btc unfortunately artificial intelligence models are commonly black box methods which their inner rules are not easily comprehensible usage of these models is very difficult and may be prone to overfitting the optimum structure of these models was determined by trial and error which requires high computational time strong dependence of artificial intelligence models to the experimental data is the main challenges of these methods in prediction of btc 36 in this work a flexible approach based on the numerical simulation of one dimensional unsteady of advection dispersion adsorption equation uadrae has been employed to simulate the dynamic behavior of the columns the equation was solved numerically based on the implicit finite difference method ifdm for simulation the removal of cd ii ions on bone ash nzvi composite in a fixed bed column system three statistical indices including mean residual error mre normalized root mean square error nrmse and linear regression were employed to assess the performance of the removal furthermore the effect of the operating variables for dynamic adsorption of cd ii ions was investigated and the performance of oba nzvi composite even after one year of storage under laboratory conditions was also studied finally several characterization techniques such as x ray diffraction xrd and high resolution x ray photoelectron spectroscopy hr xps were used to identify the mechanisms of cd ii removal by oba nzvi 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials high purity chemicals 99 aldrich co such as cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate cd no3 2 4h2o iron ii chloride tetrahydrate fecl2 4h2o sodium borohydride nabh4 hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh were used desired concentration of cd ii were prepared from stock solution 1000 mg l 1 using distilled deionized water 2 2 preparation of the adsorbent ostrich bones were provided from local butcher s store 12 the oba was obtained according to the following procedure ostrich bone wastes dried at 70 c for 24 h boiling in water 2 h solid wastes pulverized with a 45 80 range mesh burning in air at 550 c for 24 h oba oba nzvi composite was synthesized according to zhang et al 19 via the reduction of fecl3 6h2o by nabh4 briefly 10 g of fecl3 6h2o was dissolved in 100 ml of an aqueous solution of ethanol 30 v v then 4 g of oba was added while the mixture was vigorously stirred in an ultrasonic shaker for 30 min meanwhile a certain amount of nabh4 1 8 g of nabh4 in 100 ml of deionized water was added incrementally into the mixture while the fe iii oba were mixed uniformly under nitrogen atmosphere using a magnetic stir bar after the entire addition of the nabh4 solution the slurry were stirred mechanically for 30 min and then filtered using a büchner vacuum filtration funnel 0 45 μm filter in our previous work 15 several physicochemical teniques were employed to determine the morphology of oba nzvi composite 2 3 characterization techniques ph measurements were conducted using a metrohm 827 ph mv meter the concentrations of cd ii solutions were measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes shimadzu arl 34000 the specific surface area of oba nzvi was measured by brunauer emmet teller bet method using surface area analyzer quantachrome usa at 77 k sem edx analysis was performed using a tescan vega 3 w edx instrument the selected areas on the oba nzvi surfaces for edx analysis was done randomly the patterns of x ray powder diffraction xrd philips x pert mpd diffractometer were recorded to study the mineral composition of fresh and aged oba nzvi composite under follow conditions 2θ 10 100 cu kα radiation 0 154 nm scanning rate 3 of 2θ per min high resolution x ray photoelectron spectroscopy hr xps bestec x ray photoelectron spectrometer germany was employed to identify the valence state of cadmium under follow condition al kα radiation 15 kv high vacuum 1 10 7 mbar 2 4 column design and measurements packed bed adsorption studies were performed in glass columns of 2 cm of internal diameter and 40 cm total of height the schematic diagram of experimental setup and associated components is displayed in fig 1 cd ii ions solution with various initial influent concentrations 100 150 and 200 mg l 1 were pumped upward into the column with several bed heights 20 25 and 30 cm using a peristaltic pump at various feed flow rates 0 5 1 1 5 10 20 and 30 ml min 1 and phs 2 5 7 and 9 at a constant temperature 25 1 c effluent samples were collected at certain time interval and the concentrations of cd ii ions were measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy the following equations were applied to investigate the dynamic behavior of cd ii ions removal by oba nzvi 31 1 e f f l u e n t v o l u m e q t e 2 t o t a l a m o u n t o f c d i i i o n s s e n t t h r o u g h t h e c o l u m n m t o t a l m g c o q t e 1000 3 t o t a l q u

the adsorbed cd ii ions concentration inlet cd ii ions concentration c o outlet cd ii ions concentration c e q is the volumetric flow rate ml min 1 t e is the exhaustion time min the time at which cd ii ions concentration in the outlet achieved 99 5 of inlet cd ii ions concentration and m is the amount of oba nzvi in the column 2 5 modeling approach in the present study the column breakthrough curves are obtained via numerical simulation of one dimensional time varying version of advection dispersion adsorption equation the solution mass balance equation considering the adsorption effect is formulated as 37 6 c t d 2 c x 2 u c x ρ b ε q t in the above equation c and q represent the cd ii concentration in liquid and solid phases respectively the porous column bed properties such as porosity dispersion coefficient bulk density as well as superficial velocity are symbolized as ε d ρb and u respectively according to eq 6 the left hand side term represents the mass accumulation of cd ii within the assumed local element while the right hand side terms are the affecting mechanisms for the cd ii concentration variations namely advection dispersion and adsorption advection is known as a species transport mechanism due to the bulk flow stream second term at the right side of eq 6 hence to estimate the species transport flux by advection mechanism the bulk flow velocity is needed to be calculated for 1d simulations the bulk flow velocity is simply evaluated based on the mass flow rate and the section area of the column however for 2d or 3d modeling scenarios it should be obtained via the solution of the navier stokes equations in porous media in the absence of bulk mass flow the species transport is performed by the dispersion mechanism first term at the right side of eq 6 the dispersion phenomena can be governed by the fick s law based on the fick s equation the species dispersion flux is related to the local gradient of the concentration c x as well as the diffusion coefficient d the third term on the right side of eq 6 represents the variations of cd ii concentration due to the adsorption mechanism the mentioned mechanism is due to the attachment of the dissolved components to the surface areas while passing through the aquifer solids in the above equation two unknown parameters c and q can be related via implementation of well known langmuir isothermal equilibrium equation as 7 q k q t c c 0 k 1 c where the constant parameters of k q t and c 0 are the apparent equilibrium constant the maximum adsorption capacity of oba nzvi composite and the total cd ii concentration respectively these constant parameters are case dependent and can be estimated by the statistical analysis of exprimental data therefore by application of the chain rule the sink term in the right side of the eq 6 can be stated as 8 q t q c c t thus eq 6 can be written as 9 c t d 2 c x 2 u c x ρ b ε q c c t considering the infinite adsorption rate assumption i e local

order differentiation in the present study α is set to 0 5 to implement the central difference moreover to predict the variation of the results in time smoothly the time weight function β is set to 0 5 to utilize the current and previous time step data uniformly another important parameter to check for the resolution of the numerical results is to set peclet number u l δ x d to proper values see below 2 the above equations have been solved by using the matlab software 2 6 evaluation criteria mre and nrmse statistical criteria were applied to compare the experimental and simulated results of ct co for the dynamic adsorption of cd ii ions in a packed bed column system these criteria are described as follows 38 18 m r e i 1 n c t c o s i m c t c o exp n c t c o exp 19 n r m s e i 1 n c t c o s i m c t c o exp 2 n c t c o exp 0 5 100 where ct co exp and ct co sim are the experimental and simulated values respectively c t c o exp is the average of the experimental values and n is he data numbers overestimation and underestimation of the numerical model were determined by mre in fact mre is a measure of prediction bias with negative and positive mre amounts representing underestimation and overestimation respectively the performance of the numerical model is poor when the nrmse 30 fair if the 20 nrmse 30 good if the 10 nrmse 20 and excellent if the 0 nrmse 10 in general the performance of numerical model is acceptable if the nrmse 30 for better assessment the linear regression was fitted between ct co exp and ct co sim values by the following equation 20 c t c o exp m c t c o s i m n where m and n are the slope of line and distance from the origin respectively the value of n is considered zero when it is not significant at 5 level 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of the numerical model the performance of the numerical method was assessed with the mre nrmse and r2 between the experimental values and modelled outputs see table 1 the results demonstrated that simulated values of ct co by numerical model were in a good accord to the observed data set the scatter plot of simulated ct co values by the numerical model versus experimental data is presented in fig 2 the correlation between the experimental values and modelled outputs by the numerical model equals 0 97 also the prediction intervals at 95 level based on the distribution of points around the fitted line exhibit a good reliability for fitting and simulating btc of cd ii ions see fig 2 according to the data included in table 1 the intercept of linear regression between the simulated cd ii concentration resulted by the model and the observed data is not significant at the 5 level whereas the slope of linear regression is significant at the 5 level the ct co values of the numerical model are greater than the observed ct co where the ratio of c t c o s i m c t c o exp is 1 026 the positive value of mre 0 0029 displays that the prediction of btc by the numerical model is only slightly overestimated about 2 6 the numerical model provides excellent performance to simulate the btc where the value of nrmse is equal to 7 66 the above results can be ascribed to the fact that the numerical models solve the governing equation using physically and chemically meaningful parameters 36 3 2 results of the numerical model under various operational parameters the simulation the adsorption and transport of cd ii ions by oba nzvi composite in the fixed bed column have been carried out using the eq 17 a close accord was observed between measured and simulated btc under various operational parameters see figs 3a 5a as it is possible to see from the results included in figs 3a 5a the performance of numerical model is excellent not only to predict symmetrical btc but also for the modeling of unsymmetrical btc the operational parameters including the influent flow rate see figs 3 and s1 s5 the influent cd ii concentration see figs s1 s6 and 4 and the initial ph solution see figs s1 s7 s8 and 5 affected robustly on the shape of the btc the flow rate is a crucial parameter to assess the performance of the adsorbent for wastewater treatment systems particularly at the industrial scale 32 moreover the mass transfer between the surface of the oba nzvi and cd ii ions in solution are affected by the influent flow rate 16 the effect of various feed flow rates for dynamic adsorption of cd ii ions is examined in the range of 0 5 30 ml min 1 while the initial cd ii concentration 150 mg l 1 bed depth 25 cm and solution ph 7 were kept constant see figs 3 s1 s5 it is clear that breakthrough bt time and t e displaced to earlier time with boosting feed flow rates in general the adsorption efficiency of cd ii ions by oba nzvi decreased while the feed flow rate was raised 16 32 the order of the cd ii removal in various flow rates was from 0 5 to 30 ml min 1 see figs 3a s1a s5a this evolution may be related to the high interaction between cd ii ions and oba nzvi composite at q 0 5 ml min 1 due to adequate reaction time of the pollutant with the adsorbent 31 moreover insufficient diffusion of the cd ii ions into the pores of the oba nzvi may be occurred at q 30 ml min 1 the advance curves of non dimensional cd ii concentration in the length of the column during the various experimental times for various influent flow rates were also investigated see figs 3b s1b s5b for this regards the initial cd ii concentration 150 mg l 1 the bed depth 25 cm and the ph solution 7 were kept constant from the results presented in these figures it can be found that the cd ii concentration in the effluent raised when the experimental time was increased and the column became saturated with cd ii as the solution continued to flow see figs 3b s1b s5b at q 0 5 ml min 1 the values of ct co reached 0 0 0 0 025 and 0 58 when the experimental time reached 1 2 4 8 and 12 h respectively in the column depth of 0 25 m see fig 3b similarly at q 30 ml min 1 the values of ct co reached 0 4 0 72 and 0 94 while experimental time reached 1 2 and 4 h respectively in the column depth of 0 25 m see fig s5b following the increase of the flow rates the advance curves of non dimensional cd ii concentration in the depth of the column changed from a non linear shape to a nearly linear form which indicates a sharp advance curves at high influent flow rates in fact the decrease in the external film mass resistance at the surface of the oba nzvi composite may occur at q 30 ml min 1 demonstrating to a fall in the saturation time at q 0 5 ml min 1 the advance curve of non dimensional cd ii concentration starts from ct co 1 at the bottom of the column to ct co 0 at the column depth of 0 125 m in the interval of 1 h until pollutant reached to 0 175 and 0 25 m in the intervals of 2 and 4 h respectively with ct co 0 following the increase of the experimental time up to 12 h the ct co value in the column depth of 0 25 m increases to 0 58 similarly at q 30 ml min 1 the advance curve of non dimensional cd ii concentration in the intervals of 1 2 and 4 h starts from ct co 1 at the bottom of the column to ct co 0 4 0 72 and 0 94 in the depth of 0 25 respectively similar results were observed in other influent flow rates the dynamic adsorption of cd ii ions varying the initial concentrations 100 200 mg l 1 by oba nzvi composite was also studied when the other variables were fixed see figs 4 9 and 10 when the inlet cd ii concentration raised a sharp btc were found and also the bt time and t e displaced towards earlier level in fact the concentration gradient between oba nzvi composite and the solution was raised with rising the inlet cd ii concentration causing an increase in the driving force for mass transfer the order of the cd ii elimination in various inlet concentration was from 100 mg l 1 to 200 mg l 1 see figs s1a s6a and 4a for various concentrations of cd ii the progress curves of the concentration of cd ii non dimensional along the length of the column with time were also investigated see figs s1b s6b and 4b at co 100 mg l 1 the curve of non dimensional cd ii concentration starts from ct co 1 at the bottom of the column to ct co 0 at the column depth of 0 125 m in the interval of 1 h until pollutant reached to 0 175 and 0 25 m in the intervals of 2 to 4 h respectively with ct co 0 following the increase of the experimental time to 8 and 12 h the ct co values in the depth of 0 25 m increase to 0 1 and 0 72 see fig s6b at co 200 mg l 1 the curve of non dimensional cd ii concentration starts from ct co 1 at the bottom of the column to ct co 0 at the column depth of 0 172 m in the interval of 1 h until pollutant reached to 0 25 m in the intervals of 2 h with ct co 0 following the increase of the experimental time to 4 and 8 h the ct co values in the depth of 0 25 m increase to 0 095 and 0 84 see fig 4b this behavior can be explained by the fast saturation of the active sites of the adsorbent at great initial cd ii concentration resulting a decrease of the bt time 33 34 the ph is an important parameter which can affect the electrostatic interaction between the surface of the oba nzvi composite and the cd ii ions and the cadmium chemistry in water 16 35 to consider this parameter the btc of cd ii ions were studied at ph 2 5 7 and 9 while the other operational variables were fixed see figs s1 s7 s8 and 5 when the ph was increased from 2 to 9 the greatest adsorption capacity and the longest btc was attained at ph 9 in general the order of the cd ii removal at various ph decrease from 9 to 2 where the broadest mass transfer zone was observed at ph 2 see figs s1a s7a s8a and 5a this trend can be related to the point of zero charge phpzc and the various forms of the cadmium ion the surface of the oba nzvi will be positively charged at a ph lower than 5 87 and negatively charged at a ph higher than 5 87 15 at a ph of 5 87 the surface charge of oba nzvi is neutral and the electrostatic attraction between the oba nzvi and the cd ii ions is insignificant at this ph the competition between h ions and the cationic species of cadmium for binding to vacant oba nzvi sites leads to the significant decrease in the cd ii adsorption also the electrostatic repulsion between the cationic species of cadmium which can exist at a ph of 5 87 and the positive charge of oba nzvi may occur the protonation deprotonation of the oh groups on the surface of the oba nzvi composite and precipitation of cd oh 2 in solution as well on the surface of oba nzvi are responsible to the adsorption of cd ii ions in this ph range 7 the advance curves of non dimensional cd ii concentration in the length of the column during the various experimental time for several phs were also investigated see figs s1b s7b s8b and 5b for this regards the initial cd ii concentration 150 mg l 1 the bed depth 25 cm and the influent flow rate 1 ml min 1 were kept constant at a ph 2 the values of ct co were 0 0 185 0 77 and 1 while experimental time was 1 2 4 and 8 h respectively in the column depth of 0 25 m see fig 5b similarly at a ph 9 the values of ct co were 0 0 0 0 32 and 0 78 while experimental time reached 1 2 4 8 and 12 h respectively in the column depth of 0 25 m see fig s7b at a ph 2 the advance curve of non dimensional cd ii concentration begins from ct co 1 at the bottom of the column to ct co 0 0 185 0 77 and 1 at the end of the column in the interval of 1 2 4 and 8 h respectively see fig 5b at a ph 9 the advance curve of non dimensional cd ii concentration starts from ct co 1 at the bottom of the column to ct co 0 at the column depth of 0 127 m in the interval of 1 h until pollutant reached to 0 2 and 0 25 m in the intervals of 2 and 4 h respectively with ct co 0 following the increase of experimental time to 8 and 12 h the ct co values in the depth of 0 25 m increase to 0 32 and 0 78 see fig s7b similar results were observed in other phs the weight of oba nzvi composite loaded in the column and also the pressure drop 34 can show significant effects on the adsorption of cd ii ions for that various bed depths of adsorbent are examined in the range of 20 30 cm all the parameters including the influent concentration the feed flow rate and the ph were kept constants when the bed depth was increased from 20 to 30 cm the greatest adsorption capacity and the longest btc was attained at h 30 cm moreover the bt time and t e raised with rising the bed depth the order of the cd ii elimination in various bed depth was from 20 to 30 cm whereas the broadest mass transfer zone was observed at h 30 cm data not presented in fact the greater bed height of the adsorbent in the column grant a rising in the accessibility of active sites in contact with cd ii ions 33 this can be also related to axial dispersion in the column 3 3 sensitivity analysis of numerical model the effect of the axial dispersion coefficient d the apparent equilibrium constant k and the maximum adsorption capacity qt on the btc was assessed by sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was conducted by variation one factor in each simulation with a bed height of 25 cm an inlet flow rate of 1 5 ml min 1 an influent cd ii concentration of 150 mg l 1 and a ph of 7 simulated btc for various amounts of d are presented in fig 6 the variation of d was considered between eight times greater and eight times smaller than the reference value 2056 10 5m2 s 1 it can be found that a steeper slope in the btc was occurred when the value of d decreased moreover bt time was also changed with rising or decreeing the value of d so that the greater variation in bt time was observed at lower d in general the numerical model was sensitive to the value of d because the shape of the btc was considerably changed by this parameter the effect of qt on the shape of the btc is shown in fig 7 the slope of the btc was not changed by variation of this parameter whereas the btc shifted to the origin with rising qt see fig 7 the simulated btc for various amounts of the k are illustrated in fig 8 it can be observed that the numerical model was sensitive to the k value when it is lower than three whereas the model was not sensitive to the k value when it is higher than three see fig 8 3 4 the performance of fresh and aged oba nzvi composite for dynamic adsorption of cd ii ions poor mechanical strength aggregation and low durability of uncoated nzvi are the major problems of these nanoparticles in groundwater remediation 17 19 these drawbacks can be solved by immobilization of nzvi on porous materials such as bone ash to enhance the stability in air in fact the beads can be selected as the best carrier if they barricade the nzvi particles from aggregation and oxidation even after prolonged time hence the effect of the aging time for dynamic adsorption of cd ii ions is examined after one year of the stabilized nzvi on oba sem images of fresh oba nzvi aged oba nzvi and oba nzvi after cd ii adsorption are seen in fig 9 surface roughness of adsorbent was aggregated with plentiful nanoparticles due to the great specific surface area 109 m2 g 1 and magnetic dipole dipole interactions see fig 9a the structure of oba nzvi composite was still preserved even after one year of storage under laboratory conditions and no significant differences was observed between fresh and aged oba nzvi in terms of shape and size see fig 9b however the presence of some larger nanoparticles might be due to the surface oxidation of nzvi the surface morphology of oba nzvi was considerably changed after cd ii adsorption so that the large flake like species were made on the surface of oba nzvi see fig 9c xrd patterns of fresh oba nzvi aged oba nzvi and oba nzvi after cd ii adsorption are presented in fig 10 it was found that the fundamental components of fresh and aged oba nzvi composite comprised hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 6 oh 2 and iron nanoparticles in its zero valent state see fig 10a and b signals of the fe2o3 and fe3o4 were not detected in the structure of fresh oba nzvi see fig 10a whereas weak intensities of them were observed in the xrd pattern of the aged sample see fig 10b as a result of the surface oxidation of nzvi it is notable that the black color of fresh oba nzvi was not changed even after aging time of twelve months demonstrating that the oba could be an excellent stabilizer for nzvi xrd analysis of oba nzvi confirm the presence of cdo at the 2 θ 39 º 4 55 8 6 68 1 7 and 84 7 8 beside the ca10 po4 6 oh 2 as the principal components of adsorbent at the 2 θ 31 28 º 1 and 32 74 2 after contact with cd ii solutions see fig 10c in fact the appearance of cdo phase instead of cd imply that the cd ii ions is not reduced to zerovalent cadmium the direct reduction is not the predominant mechanism x ray diffraction pattern indicated that the peak at 2 θ 36 º 3 belonging to fe2o3 and the peak at 2 θ 45 5 belonging to fe 5 appeared after the oba nzvi was incubated in cd ii solution see fig 10c therefore the presence of a peak related to the fe confirms that the zero valent iron was not entirely oxidized on the surface of oba nzvi edx analysis was employed to assess the element composition of oba nzvi before and after cd ii adsorption see fig 11 the edx result demonstrated that oba nzvi basically included in ca p fe o na k al and mn and no remarkable signals of other elements were detected see fig 11a in fact fe came from nzvi and other elements such as ca p na k al and mn would come from oba the o element would come from nzvi and oba the strong cadmium signals detected while oba nzvi was incubated in cd ii solution see fig 11b in order to evaluate the performance of fresh and aged oba nzvi in removal of cd ii ions column studies were performed under follow condition temperature 25 1 c influent concentration 150 mg l 1 bed height 25 cm ph 7 and flow rate 1 5 ml min 1 see fig 12 the consequences demonstrated that the oba nzvi has greatly preserved its ability for dynamic adsorption of cd ii ions even after one year of storage under laboratory conditions see fig 12 3 5 influence of the ionic strength one of the important parameters which can affect the adsorption efficiency of cd ii ions particularly in real water is the ionic strength the thickness of the double layer and the binding ability towards the cd ii ions are affected by the ionic strength 7 furthermore the electrostatic outer sphere complexation reactions may be an adsorption mechanism for the uptake of cd ii ions based on the observed changes in adsorption capacity with the ionic strength the effect of the ionic strength toward cd ii uptake was determined in solutions with several concentrations of nacl 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 m see fig 13 for this regards the initial cd ii concentration 150 mg l 1 the flow rate 1 5 ml min 1 the bed height 25 cm and the ph 7 were retained fixed the removal efficiency of cd ii ions was considerably decreased when the ionic strength of the solution increased from 0 to 0 6 m the exhaustion and bt times displaced to earlier time with boosting ionic strength so that sharper btc was achieved at the nacl concentration of 0 6 m see fig 13 in fact the stable cd cl complexes with lower adsorption tendency was formed at a nacl concentration of 0 6 m 39 furthermore compression of the electrical double layer edl on the surface of oba nzvi may be occurred at greater ionic strength which resulted to the emancipation of the adsorbed cadmium 39 consequently formation of outer sphere complexes is responsible to explain the effect of the ionic strength for dynamic adsorption of cd ii ions since na which presents in the background electrolyte could compete with cd ii ions adsorbed on the outer sphere sorption sites 3 6 adsorption mechanism fe can operate as an active electron donator for reduction of any pollutants which have a greater reduction potential than 0 440 v 18 in previous studies it is demonstrated that the removal mechanism of hg ii ions which have highly more positive standard reduction potential than fe is predominantly reduction whereas the removal mechanism of pb ii which has slightly more positive standard reduction potential than fe is predominantly adsorption reduction 15 however to date limited researches have been performed for the elimination of cd ii ions in a batch system 7 22 40 41 to the best of our knowledge there is no reports about employing stabilized nzvi on the removal of cd ii ions in a fixed bed column system cadmium has standard reduction potential very close to that of fe 42 21 f e f e 2 2 e e 0 0 41 v 22 c d c d 2 2 e e 0 0 40 v thus there is no reduction of cd ii to cd by zvi on the surface of oba nzvi for this regards xps analysis was applied to identify the valence state of cadmium primary elements in the fresh nzvi comprised fe o c and b which come from fecl3 6h2o and nabh4 see fig s9a signals at 192 284 8 531 2 and 711 2 ev exhibit b c o and fe respectively xps wide scan survey of oba nzvi displays peaks for ca and p as the major components of ca10 po4 6 oh 2 see fig 14 a xps survey of the oba nzvi composite shows the peak for cd ii ions at 405 3 ev from cd3d after contact with 1000 mg l 1 cd ii solution see fig s9b xps survey of the fe2p region indicated that the photoelectron peak at 711 2 ev belonging to fe iii and the peak at 706 5 ev belonging to fe appeared on the reacted oba nzvi surface see fig s9c so the presence of peaks related to the fe confirms the zero valent iron was not entirely oxidized on the surface of oba nzvi xps survey of the cd3d on the oba nzvi surface after impregnation in 1000 mg l 1 cd ii solutions indicated that the photoelectron peaks at 405 3 ev and 412 4 belonging to cd ii are appeared demonstrating that the valence state of cd on the oba nzvi surface retains as 2 see fig 14b the results obtained from xps technique confirmed the results from xrd analysis these results are in accord to boparai et al 40 baparai et al 41 zhang et al 22 and soleymanzadeh et al 7 therefore the likelihood of direct reduction from cd ii to cd by fe on the oba nzvi surface is negligible suggesting sorption or complex formation is the predominantly mechanism 4 conclusions the present study reveals a rigorous model based on the numerical simulation of one dimensional uadae solved by the ifdm to simulate the dynamic adsorption of cd ii ions on oba nzvi composite in a fixed bed column system dynamic adsorption of cd ii ions was studied as a function of the initial solution ph the influent flow rate the bed height and the initial cd ii concentration the results have indicated that 1 the numerical model had a excellent performance to simulate btc nrmse 7 66 and it tended to overestimate the btc very slightly mre 0 0029 2 the numerical model provides reliable results to simulate the performance of btc r2 0 97 3 the sensitivity analysis indicated that the d had more significant impact on the column dynamic simulation 4 the values of k 3 significantly affected the slope of btc whereas any change in qt was not impacted the slope of the btc 5 the suggested model can be applied for simulation the dynamic adsorption process in an industrial wastewater treatment system 6 the bt time and t e decreased with increasing the influent flow rate the initial cd ii concentration and the ionic strength and increased with rising the initial solution ph and the bed height 7 oba nzvi was a versatile and eco friendly adsorbent in attenuating cadmium ions in a fixed bed column 8 oba nzvi preserves adsorption tendency toward cd ii ions even after one year of storage under laboratory conditions 9 the results obtained from xrd and xps analyses demonstrate that the predominantly mechanism of cadmium removal consists sorption surface complex formation so that no apparent redox reaction between cd ii ions and oba nzvi conflicts of interest none appendix a

14505,a rigorous model based on the numerical simulation of one dimensional unsteady of advection dispersion adsorption equation uadae solved by the implicit finite difference method ifdm has been employed to simulate the dynamic adsorption of cd ii ions on ostrich bone ash oba nanoscale zerovalent iron particles nzvi composite oba nzvi in a fixed bed column system the accuracy of the numerical model was assessed by employing three criteria mean residual error mre normalized root mean square error nrmse and coefficient of determination r2 the numerical model tracked the observed values very closely r2 0 9698 it was found that the numerical model had the excellent performance to simulate breakthrough curves btc nrmse 7 66 and it tended to overestimate the btc very slightly mre 0 0029 the sensitivity analysis indicated that the axial dispersion coefficient d had more significant impact on the column dynamic simulation therefore it is possible to describe the adsorption process for wastewater treatment systems in a more cost effective and easier way with the suggested model application the results obtained from sem and xrd analyses confirmed that the oba nzvi composite preserved its capabilities even after one year of storage under room conditions the results also obtained from xps technique confirmed that the removal mechanism of cd ii ions which have the standard reduction potential very close to that of fe is the sorption surface complex formation without reduction of cd ii to cd by nzvi keywords breakthrough curves cadmium adsorption numerical model advection dispersion adsorption finite difference method 1 introduction cadmium mainly in the state of ionic is one of the most inorganic pollutants which can cause adverse effects on plants animals and humans hypertension kidneys disease liver failure bone damage and lung insufficiency are the main harmful health effects of cd ii on the humans 1 for instance in 1995 the existence of high cd ii concentrations in rice caused the itai itai disease in japan 2 effluents from several industries including stabilizers paint pigments metal plating silver cadmium batteries plastics ceramic and mining are the main source of cadmium pollution 3 the admissible amount of cd ii ions in drinking water domestic wastewater and industrial effluents are 0 005 0 001 0 004 and 0 1 0 2 mg l 1 respectively as defined by the environmental protection agency epa 4 thus the removal of cd ii ions from contaminated wastewaters is necessary not only to preserve the human health but also for the conservation of the water resources adsorption process has been considered to be more important as compared with other classical wastewater treatments like electrochemical membrane processes chemical precipitation evaporation and filtration for the cd ii removal in terms of high efficiency low cost and flexibility of design 1 5 7 among other adsorbents animal bone wastes which are composed by hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 6 oh 2 have been broadly used for the removal of several heavy metals due to the high efficiency natural abundance and relatively inexpensive 5 8 9 every year in iran as the third country for production and breeding of ostrich meat 10 around 120 000 150 000 ostriches are slaughtered and a large amount of bone wastes are generated which can be used for wastewater treatment instead of commercial adsorbents in previous studies it is successfully examined the potential use of ostrich bone wastes as adsorbents under several forms for the removal of pb ii and hg ii ions 9 11 13 and also methyl orange 14 ostrich bone ash oba as a cheap and abundant adsorbent has an excellent capability for elimination inorganic cations 12 15 however oba has limited application because of the difficulty to recycling and separation 16 to resolve this drawback nanoscale zerovalent iron nzvi has been used to combine oba 15 16 which can be separated using an external magnetic field without filtration and centrifugation poor mechanical strength aggregation and low durability of uncoated nzvi are the major problems of these nanoparticles in groundwater remediation 17 19 which can be solved by immobilization of nzvi on porous materials to enhance the stability during the adsorption process however most researches of entrapped nzvi in biomaterial beads are confined to batch experiment mode 17 22 from the practical point of view the continuous adsorption in a packed bed column system is favorable due to the high grade of flexibility reliability and stability at several operational conditions such as influent concentration bed depth flow rate ph temperature among other parameters the efficiency of a fixed bed column system is evaluated from the breakthrough curve a breakthrough curve is acquired by plotting effluent concentration versus time of treatment for a constant flow rate the prediction of breakthrough curve is essential to control and design of the dynamic adsorption process hence btc can be predicted by several mathematical empirical equations including thomas 1944 pandit et al 2001 yan et al 2001 agrios et al 2003 and yavuz and koparal 2006 23 27 in general these analytical methods are appropriate to characterize the fixed bed adsorption process with a symmetrical btc constant pattern solution however the performance of these equations is diminished for describing the fixed bed columns adsorption process with an unsymmetrical btc complex adsorption process 28 adsorption isotherms diffusion characteristics and flow rate determine the shape of the mass transfer zone concave upward unfavorable isotherms give proportionate patterns whereas convex upward favorable isotherms achieve constant pattern in proportionate patterns namely equilibrium limited model the width of the mass transfer zone increases in direct proportion to the distance traveled through the column the constant pattern which has the constant mass transfer zone breadth provides analytical solutions or simplified mass transfer equations 29 30 nowadays application of artificial intelligence methods such as artificial neural networks 28 31 35 has been successfully developed to predict the performance of btc unfortunately artificial intelligence models are commonly black box methods which their inner rules are not easily comprehensible usage of these models is very difficult and may be prone to overfitting the optimum structure of these models was determined by trial and error which requires high computational time strong dependence of artificial intelligence models to the experimental data is the main challenges of these methods in prediction of btc 36 in this work a flexible approach based on the numerical simulation of one dimensional unsteady of advection dispersion adsorption equation uadrae has been employed to simulate the dynamic behavior of the columns the equation was solved numerically based on the implicit finite difference method ifdm for simulation the removal of cd ii ions on bone ash nzvi composite in a fixed bed column system three statistical indices including mean residual error mre normalized root mean square error nrmse and linear regression were employed to assess the performance of the removal furthermore the effect of the operating variables for dynamic adsorption of cd ii ions was investigated and the performance of oba nzvi composite even after one year of storage under laboratory conditions was also studied finally several characterization techniques such as x ray diffraction xrd and high resolution x ray photoelectron spectroscopy hr xps were used to identify the mechanisms of cd ii removal by oba nzvi 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials high purity chemicals 99 aldrich co such as cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate cd no3 2 4h2o iron ii chloride tetrahydrate fecl2 4h2o sodium borohydride nabh4 hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh were used desired concentration of cd ii were prepared from stock solution 1000 mg l 1 using distilled deionized water 2 2 preparation of the adsorbent ostrich bones were provided from local butcher s store 12 the oba was obtained according to the following procedure ostrich bone wastes dried at 70 c for 24 h boiling in water 2 h solid wastes pulverized with a 45 80 range mesh burning in air at 550 c for 24 h oba oba nzvi composite was synthesized according to zhang et al 19 via the reduction of fecl3 6h2o by nabh4 briefly 10 g of fecl3 6h2o was dissolved in 100 ml of an aqueous solution of ethanol 30 v v then 4 g of oba was added while the mixture was vigorously stirred in an ultrasonic shaker for 30 min meanwhile a certain amount of nabh4 1 8 g of nabh4 in 100 ml of deionized water was added incrementally into the mixture while the fe iii oba were mixed uniformly under nitrogen atmosphere using a magnetic stir bar after the entire addition of the nabh4 solution the slurry were stirred mechanically for 30 min and then filtered using a büchner vacuum filtration funnel 0 45 μm filter in our previous work 15 several physicochemical teniques were employed to determine the morphology of oba nzvi composite 2 3 characterization techniques ph measurements were conducted using a metrohm 827 ph mv meter the concentrations of cd ii solutions were measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes shimadzu arl 34000 the specific surface area of oba nzvi was measured by brunauer emmet teller bet method using surface area analyzer quantachrome usa at 77 k sem edx analysis was performed using a tescan vega 3 w edx instrument the selected areas on the oba nzvi surfaces for edx analysis was done randomly the patterns of x ray powder diffraction xrd philips x pert mpd diffractometer were recorded to study the mineral composition of fresh and aged oba nzvi composite under follow conditions 2θ 10 100 cu kα radiation 0 154 nm scanning rate 3 of 2θ per min high

high vacuum 1 10 7 mbar 2 4 column design and measurements packed bed adsorption studies were performed in glass columns of 2 cm of internal diameter and 40 cm total of height the schematic diagram of experimental setup and associated components is displayed in fig 1 cd ii ions solution with various initial influent concentrations 100 150 and 200 mg l 1 were pumped upward into the column with several bed heights 20 25 and 30 cm using a peristaltic pump at various feed flow rates 0 5 1 1 5 10 20 and 30 ml min 1 and phs 2 5 7 and 9 at a constant temperature 25 1 c effluent samples were collected at certain time interval and the concentrations of cd ii ions were measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy the following equations were applied to investigate the dynamic behavior of cd ii ions removal by oba nzvi 31 1 e f f l u e n t v o l u m e q t e 2 t o t a l a m o u n t o f c d i i i o n s s e n t t h r o u g h t h e c o l u m n m t o t a l m g c o q t e 1000 3 t o t a l q u

the adsorbed cd ii ions concentration inlet cd ii ions concentration c o outlet cd ii ions concentration c e q is the volumetric flow rate ml min 1 t e is the exhaustion time min the time at which cd ii ions concentration in the outlet achieved 99 5 of inlet cd ii ions concentration and m is the amount of oba nzvi in the column 2 5 modeling approach in the present study the column breakthrough curves are obtained via numerical simulation of one dimensional time varying version of advection dispersion adsorption equation the solution mass balance equation considering the adsorption effect is formulated as 37 6 c t d 2 c x 2 u c x ρ b ε q t in the above equation c and q represent the cd ii concentration in liquid and solid phases respectively the porous column bed properties such as porosity dispersion coefficient bulk density as well as superficial velocity are symbolized as ε d ρb and u respectively according to eq 6 the left hand side term represents the mass accumulation of cd ii within the assumed local element while the right hand side terms are the affecting mechanisms for the cd ii concentration variations namely advection dispersion and adsorption advection is known as a species transport mechanism due to the bulk flow stream second term at the right side of eq 6 hence to estimate the species transport flux by advection mechanism the bulk flow velocity is needed to be calculated for 1d simulations the bulk flow velocity is simply evaluated based on the mass flow rate and the section area of the column however for 2d or 3d modeling scenarios it should be obtained via the solution of the navier stokes equations in porous media in the absence of bulk mass flow the species transport is performed by the dispersion mechanism first term at the right side of eq 6 the dispersion phenomena can be governed by the fick s law based on the fick s equation the species dispersion flux is related to the local gradient of the concentration c x as well as the diffusion coefficient d the third term on the right side of eq 6 represents the variations of cd ii concentration due to the adsorption mechanism the mentioned mechanism is due to the attachment of the dissolved components to the surface areas while passing through the aquifer solids in the above equation two unknown parameters c and q can be related via implementation of well known langmuir isothermal equilibrium equation as 7 q k q t c c 0 k 1 c where the constant parameters of k q t and c 0 are the apparent equilibrium constant the maximum adsorption capacity of oba nzvi composite and the total cd ii concentration respectively these constant parameters are case dependent and can be estimated by the statistical analysis of exprimental data therefore by application of the chain rule the sink term in the right side of the eq 6 can be stated as 8 q t q c c t thus eq 6 can be written as 9 c t d 2 c x 2 u c x ρ b ε q c c t considering the infinite adsorption rate assumption i e local

order differentiation in the present study α is set to 0 5 to implement the central difference moreover to predict the variation of the results in time smoothly the time weight function β is set to 0 5 to utilize the current and previous time step data uniformly another important parameter to check for the resolution of the numerical results is to set peclet number u l δ x d to proper values see below 2 the above equations have been solved by using the matlab software 2 6 evaluation criteria mre and nrmse statistical criteria were applied to compare the experimental and simulated results of ct co for the dynamic adsorption of cd ii ions in a packed bed column system these criteria are described as follows 38 18 m r e i 1 n c t c o s i m c t c o exp n c t c o exp 19 n r m s e i 1 n c t c o s i m c t c o exp 2 n c t c o exp 0 5 100 where ct co exp and ct co sim are the experimental and simulated values respectively c t c o exp is the average of the experimental values and n is he data numbers overestimation and underestimation of the numerical model were determined by mre in fact mre is a measure of prediction bias with negative and positive mre amounts representing underestimation and overestimation respectively the performance of the numerical model is poor when the nrmse 30 fair if the 20 nrmse 30 good if the 10 nrmse 20 and excellent if the 0 nrmse 10 in general the performance of numerical model is acceptable if the nrmse 30 for better assessment the linear regression was fitted between ct co exp and ct co sim values by the following equation 20 c t c o exp m c t c o s i m n where m and n are the slope of line and distance from the origin respectively the value of n is considered zero when it is not significant at 5 level 3 results and discussion 3 1 the performance of the numerical model the performance of the numerical method was assessed with the mre nrmse and r2 between the experimental values and modelled outputs see table 1 the results demonstrated that simulated values of ct co by numerical model were in a good accord to the observed data set the scatter plot of simulated ct co values by the numerical model versus experimental data is presented in fig 2 the correlation between the experimental values and modelled outputs by the numerical model equals 0 97 also the prediction intervals at 95 level based on the distribution of points around the fitted line exhibit a good reliability for fitting and simulating btc of cd ii ions see fig 2 according to the data included in table 1 the intercept of linear regression between the simulated cd ii concentration resulted by the model and the observed data is not significant at the 5 level whereas the slope of linear regression is significant at the 5 level the ct co values of the numerical model are greater than the observed ct co where the ratio of c t c o s i m c t c o exp is 1 026 the positive value of mre 0 0029 displays that the prediction of btc by the numerical model is only slightly overestimated about 2 6 the numerical model provides excellent performance to simulate the btc where the value of nrmse is equal to 7 66 the above results can be ascribed to the fact that the numerical models solve the governing equation using physically and chemically meaningful parameters 36 3 2 results of the numerical model under various operational parameters the simulation the adsorption and transport of cd ii ions by oba nzvi composite in the fixed bed column have been carried out using the eq 17 a close accord was observed between measured and simulated btc under various operational parameters see figs 3a 5a as it is possible to see from the results included in figs 3a 5a the performance of numerical model is excellent not only to predict symmetrical btc but also for the modeling of unsymmetrical btc the operational parameters including the influent flow rate see figs 3 and s1 s5 the influent cd ii concentration see figs s1 s6 and 4 and the initial ph solution see figs s1 s7 s8 and 5 affected robustly on the shape of the btc the flow rate is a crucial parameter to assess the performance of the adsorbent for wastewater treatment systems particularly at the industrial scale 32 moreover the mass transfer between the surface of the oba nzvi and cd ii ions in solution are affected by the influent flow rate 16 the effect of various feed flow rates for dynamic adsorption of cd ii ions is examined in the range of 0 5 30 ml min 1 while the initial cd ii concentration 150 mg l 1 bed depth 25 cm and solution ph 7 were kept constant see figs 3 s1 s5 it is clear that breakthrough bt time and t e displaced to earlier time with boosting feed flow rates in general the adsorption efficiency of cd ii ions by oba nzvi decreased while the feed flow rate was raised 16 32 the order of the cd ii removal in various flow rates was from 0 5 to 30 ml min 1 see figs 3a s1a s5a this evolution may be related to the high interaction between cd ii ions and oba nzvi composite at q 0 5 ml min 1 due to adequate reaction time of the pollutant with the adsorbent 31 moreover insufficient diffusion of the cd ii ions into the pores of the oba nzvi may be occurred at q 30 ml min 1 the advance curves of non dimensional cd ii concentration in the length of the column during the various experimental times for various influent flow rates were also investigated see figs 3b s1b s5b for this regards the initial cd ii concentration 150 mg l 1 the bed depth 25 cm and the ph solution 7 were kept constant from the results presented in these figures it can be found that the cd ii concentration in the effluent raised when the experimental time was increased and the column became saturated with cd ii as the solution continued to flow see figs 3b s1b s5b at q 0 5 ml min 1 the values of ct co reached 0 0 0 0 025 and 0 58 when the experimental time reached 1 2 4 8 and 12 h respectively in the column depth of 0 25 m see fig 3b similarly at q 30 ml min 1 the values of ct co reached 0 4 0 72 and 0 94 while experimental time reached 1 2 and 4 h respectively in the column depth of 0 25 m see fig s5b following the increase of the flow rates the advance curves of non dimensional cd ii concentration in the depth of the column changed from a non linear shape to a nearly linear form which indicates a sharp advance curves at high influent flow rates in fact the decrease in the external film mass resistance at the surface of the oba nzvi composite may occur at q 30 ml min 1 demonstrating to a fall in the saturation time at q 0 5 ml min 1 the advance curve of non dimensional cd ii concentration starts from ct co 1 at the bottom of the column to ct co 0 at the column depth of 0 125 m in the interval of 1 h until pollutant reached to 0 175 and 0 25 m in the intervals of 2 and 4 h respectively with ct co 0 following the increase of the experimental time up to 12 h the ct co value in the column depth of 0 25 m increases to 0 58 similarly at q 30 ml min 1 the advance curve of non dimensional cd ii concentration in the intervals of 1 2 and 4 h starts from ct co 1 at the bottom of the column to ct co 0 4 0 72 and 0 94 in the depth of 0 25 respectively similar results were observed in other influent flow rates the dynamic adsorption of cd ii ions varying the initial concentrations 100 200 mg l 1 by oba nzvi composite was also studied when the other variables were fixed see figs 4 9 and 10 when the inlet cd ii concentration raised a sharp btc were found and also the bt time and t e displaced towards earlier level in fact the concentration gradient between oba nzvi composite and the solution was raised with rising the inlet cd ii concentration causing an increase in the driving force for mass transfer the order of the cd ii elimination in various inlet concentration was from 100 mg l 1 to 200 mg l 1 see figs s1a s6a and 4a for various concentrations of cd ii the progress curves of the concentration of cd ii non dimensional along the length of the column with time were also investigated see figs s1b s6b and 4b at co 100 mg l 1 the curve of non dimensional cd ii concentration starts from ct co 1 at the bottom of the column to ct co 0 at the column depth of 0 125 m in the interval of 1 h until pollutant reached to 0 175 and 0 25 m in the intervals of 2 to 4 h respectively with ct co 0 following the increase of the experimental time to 8 and 12 h the ct co values in the depth of 0 25 m increase to 0 1 and 0 72 see fig s6b at co 200 mg l 1 the curve of non dimensional cd ii concentration starts from ct co 1 at the bottom of the column to ct co 0 at the column depth of 0 172 m in the interval of 1 h until pollutant reached to 0 25 m in the intervals of 2 h with ct co 0 following the increase of the experimental time to 4 and 8 h the ct co values in the depth of 0 25 m increase to 0 095 and 0 84 see fig 4b this behavior can be explained by the fast saturation of the active sites of the adsorbent at great initial cd ii concentration resulting a decrease of the bt time 33 34 the ph is an important parameter which can affect the electrostatic interaction between the surface of the oba nzvi composite and the cd ii ions and the cadmium chemistry in water 16 35 to consider this parameter the btc of cd ii ions were studied at ph 2 5 7 and 9 while the other operational variables were fixed see figs s1 s7 s8 and 5 when the ph was increased from 2 to 9 the greatest adsorption capacity and the longest btc was attained at ph 9 in general the order of the cd ii removal at various ph decrease from 9 to 2 where the broadest mass transfer zone was observed at ph 2 see figs s1a s7a s8a and 5a this trend can be related to the point of zero charge phpzc and the various forms of the cadmium ion the surface of the oba nzvi will be positively charged at a ph lower than 5 87 and negatively charged at a ph higher than 5 87 15 at a ph of 5 87 the surface charge of oba nzvi is neutral and the electrostatic attraction between the oba nzvi and the cd ii ions is insignificant at this ph the competition between h ions and the cationic species of cadmium for binding to vacant oba nzvi sites leads to the significant decrease in the cd ii adsorption also the electrostatic repulsion between the cationic species of cadmium which can exist at a ph of 5 87 and the positive charge of oba nzvi may occur the protonation deprotonation of the oh groups on the surface of the oba nzvi composite and precipitation of cd oh 2 in solution as well on the surface of oba nzvi are responsible to the adsorption of cd ii ions in this ph range 7 the advance curves of non dimensional cd ii concentration in the length of the column during the various experimental time for several phs were also investigated see figs s1b s7b s8b and 5b for this regards the initial cd ii concentration 150 mg l 1 the bed depth 25 cm and the influent flow rate 1 ml min 1 were kept constant at a ph 2 the values of ct co were 0 0 185 0 77 and 1 while experimental time was 1 2 4 and 8 h respectively in the column depth of 0 25 m see fig 5b similarly at a ph 9 the values of ct co were 0 0 0 0 32 and 0 78 while experimental time reached 1 2 4 8 and 12 h respectively in the column depth of 0 25 m see fig s7b at a ph 2 the advance curve of non dimensional cd ii concentration begins from ct co 1 at the bottom of the column to ct co 0 0 185 0 77 and 1 at the end of the column in the interval of 1 2 4 and 8 h respectively see fig 5b at a ph 9 the advance curve of non dimensional cd ii concentration starts from ct co 1 at the bottom of the column to ct co 0 at the column depth of 0 127 m in the interval of 1 h until pollutant reached to 0 2 and 0 25 m in the intervals of 2 and 4 h respectively with ct co 0 following the increase of experimental time to 8 and 12 h the ct co values in the depth of 0 25 m increase to 0 32 and 0 78 see fig s7b similar results were observed in other phs the weight of oba nzvi composite loaded in the column and also the pressure drop 34 can show significant effects on the adsorption of cd ii ions for that various bed depths of adsorbent are examined in the range of 20 30 cm all the parameters including the influent concentration the feed flow rate and the ph were kept constants when the bed depth was increased from 20 to 30 cm the greatest adsorption capacity and the longest btc was attained at h 30 cm moreover the bt time and t e raised with rising the bed depth the order of the cd ii elimination in various bed depth was from 20 to 30 cm whereas the broadest mass transfer zone was observed at h 30 cm data not presented in fact the greater bed height of the adsorbent in the column grant a rising in the accessibility of active sites in contact with cd ii ions 33 this can be also related to axial dispersion in the column 3 3 sensitivity analysis of numerical model the effect of the axial dispersion coefficient d the apparent equilibrium constant k and the maximum adsorption capacity qt on the btc was assessed by sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was conducted by variation one factor in each simulation with a bed height of 25 cm an inlet flow rate of 1 5 ml min 1 an influent cd ii concentration of 150 mg l 1 and a ph of 7 simulated btc for various amounts of d are presented in fig 6 the variation of d was considered between eight times greater and eight times smaller than the reference value 2056 10 5m2 s 1 it can be found that a steeper slope in the btc was occurred when the value of d decreased moreover bt time was also changed with rising or decreeing the value of d so that the greater variation in bt time was observed at lower d in general the numerical model was sensitive to the value of d because the shape of the btc was considerably changed by this parameter the effect of qt on the shape of the btc is shown in fig 7 the slope of the btc was not changed by variation of this parameter whereas the btc shifted to the origin with rising qt see fig 7 the simulated btc for various amounts of the k are illustrated in fig 8 it can be observed that the numerical model was sensitive to the k value when it is lower than three whereas the model was not sensitive to the k value when it is higher than three see fig 8 3 4 the performance of fresh and aged oba nzvi composite for dynamic adsorption of cd ii ions poor mechanical strength aggregation and low durability of uncoated nzvi are the major problems of these nanoparticles in groundwater remediation 17 19 these drawbacks can be solved by immobilization of nzvi on porous materials such as bone ash to enhance the stability in air in fact the beads can be selected as the best carrier if they barricade the nzvi particles from aggregation and oxidation even after prolonged time hence the effect of the aging time for dynamic adsorption of cd ii ions is examined after one year of the stabilized nzvi on oba sem images of fresh oba nzvi aged oba nzvi and oba nzvi after cd ii adsorption are seen in fig 9 surface roughness of adsorbent was aggregated with plentiful nanoparticles due to the great specific surface area 109 m2 g 1 and magnetic dipole dipole interactions see fig 9a the structure of oba nzvi composite was still preserved even after one year of storage under laboratory conditions and no significant differences was observed between fresh and aged oba nzvi in terms of shape and size see fig 9b however the presence of some larger nanoparticles might be due to the surface oxidation of nzvi the surface morphology of oba nzvi was considerably changed after cd ii adsorption so that the large flake like species were made on the surface of oba nzvi see fig 9c xrd patterns of fresh oba nzvi aged oba nzvi and oba nzvi after cd ii adsorption are presented in fig 10 it was found that the fundamental components of fresh and aged oba nzvi composite comprised hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 6 oh 2 and iron nanoparticles in its zero valent state see fig 10a and b signals of the fe2o3 and fe3o4 were not detected in the structure of fresh oba nzvi see fig 10a whereas weak intensities of them were observed in the xrd pattern of the aged sample see fig 10b as a result of the surface oxidation of nzvi it is notable that the black color of fresh oba nzvi was not changed even after aging time of twelve months demonstrating that the oba could be an excellent stabilizer for nzvi xrd analysis of oba nzvi confirm the presence of cdo at the 2 θ 39 º 4 55 8 6 68 1 7 and 84 7 8 beside the ca10 po4 6 oh 2 as the principal components of adsorbent at the 2 θ 31 28 º 1 and 32 74 2 after contact with cd ii solutions see fig 10c in fact the appearance of cdo phase instead of cd imply that the cd ii ions is not reduced to zerovalent cadmium the direct reduction is not the predominant mechanism x ray diffraction pattern indicated that the peak at 2 θ 36 º 3 belonging to fe2o3 and the peak at 2 θ 45 5 belonging to fe 5 appeared after the oba nzvi was incubated in cd ii solution see fig 10c therefore the presence of a peak related to the fe confirms that the zero valent iron was not entirely oxidized on the surface of oba nzvi edx analysis was employed to assess the element composition of oba nzvi before and after cd ii adsorption see fig 11 the edx result demonstrated that oba nzvi basically included in ca p fe o na k al and mn and no remarkable signals of other elements were detected see fig 11a in fact fe came from nzvi and other elements such as ca p na k al and mn would come from oba the o element would come from nzvi and oba the strong cadmium signals detected while oba nzvi was incubated in cd ii solution see fig 11b in order to evaluate the performance of fresh and aged oba nzvi in removal of cd ii ions column studies were performed under follow condition temperature 25 1 c influent concentration 150 mg l 1 bed height 25 cm ph 7 and flow rate 1 5 ml min 1 see fig 12 the consequences demonstrated that the oba nzvi has greatly preserved its ability for dynamic adsorption of cd ii ions even after one year of storage under laboratory conditions see fig 12 3 5 influence of the ionic strength one of the important parameters which can affect the adsorption efficiency of cd ii ions particularly in real water is the ionic strength the thickness of the double layer and the binding ability towards the cd ii ions are affected by the ionic strength 7 furthermore the electrostatic outer sphere complexation reactions may be an adsorption mechanism for the uptake of cd ii ions based on the observed changes in adsorption capacity with the ionic strength the effect of the ionic strength toward cd ii uptake was determined in solutions with several concentrations of nacl 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 m see fig 13 for this regards the initial cd ii concentration 150 mg l 1 the flow rate 1 5 ml min 1 the bed height 25 cm and the ph 7 were retained fixed the removal efficiency of cd ii ions was considerably decreased when the ionic strength of the solution increased from 0 to 0 6 m the exhaustion and bt times displaced to earlier time with boosting ionic strength so that sharper btc was achieved at the nacl concentration of 0 6 m see fig 13 in fact the stable cd cl complexes with lower adsorption tendency was formed at a nacl concentration of 0 6 m 39 furthermore compression of the electrical double layer edl on the surface of oba nzvi may be occurred at greater ionic strength which resulted to the emancipation of the adsorbed cadmium 39 consequently formation of outer sphere complexes is responsible to explain the effect of the ionic strength for dynamic adsorption of cd ii ions since na which presents in the background electrolyte could compete with cd ii ions adsorbed on the outer sphere sorption sites 3 6 adsorption mechanism fe can operate as an active electron donator for reduction of any pollutants which have a greater reduction potential than 0 440 v 18 in previous studies it is demonstrated that the removal mechanism of hg ii ions which have highly more positive standard reduction potential than fe is predominantly reduction whereas the removal mechanism of pb ii which has slightly more positive standard reduction potential than fe is predominantly adsorption reduction 15 however to date limited researches have been performed for the elimination of cd ii ions in a batch system 7 22 40 41 to the best of our knowledge there is no reports about employing stabilized nzvi on the removal of cd ii ions in a fixed bed column system cadmium has standard reduction potential very close to that of fe 42 21 f e f e 2 2 e e 0 0 41 v 22 c d c d 2 2 e e 0 0 40 v thus there is no reduction of cd ii to cd by zvi on the surface of oba nzvi for this regards xps analysis was applied to identify the valence state of cadmium primary elements in the fresh nzvi comprised fe o c and b which come from fecl3 6h2o and nabh4 see fig s9a signals at 192 284 8 531 2 and 711 2 ev exhibit b c o and fe respectively xps wide scan survey of oba nzvi displays peaks for ca and p as the major components of ca10 po4 6 oh 2 see fig 14 a xps survey of the oba nzvi composite shows the peak for cd ii ions at 405 3 ev from cd3d after contact with 1000 mg l 1 cd ii solution see fig s9b xps survey of the fe2p region indicated that the photoelectron peak at 711 2 ev belonging to fe iii and the peak at 706 5 ev belonging to fe appeared on the reacted oba nzvi surface see fig s9c so the presence of peaks related to the fe confirms the zero valent iron was not entirely oxidized on the surface of oba nzvi xps survey of the cd3d on the oba nzvi surface after impregnation in 1000 mg l 1 cd ii solutions indicated that the photoelectron peaks at 405 3 ev and 412 4 belonging to cd ii are appeared demonstrating that the valence state of cd on the oba nzvi surface retains as 2 see fig 14b the results obtained from xps technique confirmed the results from xrd analysis these results are in accord to boparai et al 40 baparai et al 41 zhang et al 22 and soleymanzadeh et al 7 therefore the likelihood of direct reduction from cd ii to cd by fe on the oba nzvi surface is negligible suggesting sorption or complex formation is the predominantly mechanism 4 conclusions the present study reveals a rigorous model based on the numerical simulation of one dimensional uadae solved by the ifdm to simulate the dynamic adsorption of cd ii ions on oba nzvi composite in a fixed bed column system dynamic adsorption of cd ii ions was studied as a function of the initial solution ph the influent flow rate the bed height and the initial cd ii concentration the results have indicated that 1 the numerical model had a excellent performance to simulate btc nrmse 7 66 and it tended to overestimate the btc very slightly mre 0 0029 2 the numerical model provides reliable results to simulate the performance of btc r2 0 97 3 the sensitivity analysis indicated that the d had more significant impact on the column dynamic simulation 4 the values of k 3 significantly affected the slope of btc whereas any change in qt was not impacted the slope of the btc 5 the suggested model can be applied for simulation the dynamic adsorption process in an industrial wastewater treatment system 6 the bt time and t e decreased with increasing the influent flow rate the initial cd ii concentration and the ionic strength and increased with rising the initial solution ph and the bed height 7 oba nzvi was a versatile and eco friendly adsorbent in attenuating cadmium ions in a fixed bed column 8 oba nzvi preserves adsorption tendency toward cd ii ions even after one year of storage under laboratory conditions 9 the results obtained from xrd and xps analyses demonstrate that the predominantly mechanism of cadmium removal consists sorption surface complex formation so that no apparent redox reaction between cd ii ions and oba nzvi conflicts of interest none appendix a

14506,solid membranes for degradation of emerging contaminants such as atrazine is of significant interest for water engineering applications in this study nanocatalyst particles have been anchored on vertically aligned carpet like arrays of carbon nanotubes cnt grown on porous carbon foams this hierarchical architecture combines the advantages of highly surface active nanoparticles with the robust and reusable structural advantage of porous solid membranes suitable for water treatment devices three types of palladium based nano catalytic surfaces have been investigated metallic palladium pd pd nanoparticle with a layer of oxide pdo coated pd and pd nanoparticle coated with thin film of silver ag pd their catalytic activities have been compared by analysing the degradation rate of atrazine in water it is noted that all three catalysts show high levels of atrazine degradation with the pdo coated nanoparticles showing the highest kinetics these results demonstrate that hierarchical hybrid architectures can provide compact and powerful surface active materials such as adsorbents and catalytic degradation devices in future water treatment applications keywords hierarchical hybrid surfaces as catalyst support carbon nanotube carpets on porous membranes palladium nano particles atrazine degradation surface chemical states nano catalysts 1 introduction a wide variety of pollutants have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency usepa as contaminants of emerging concern cecs in water which pose potential threat to environment and public health 1 5 these come from common industrial products such as detergents pharmaceuticals antimicrobial agents plasticizers fertilizers herbicides and pesticides specific compounds include atrazine bisphenol a triclosan triclocarban perfluorooctanoic acid octylphenol nonylphenol carbamazepine and progestron which can be present in ground water as well as in treated wastewater effluents released into waterways there is significant need for sustainable and viable approaches of removing preferable degrading these contaminants potential techniques investigated include adsorption ozonation bio reduction photo degradation electrocatalytic and catalytic methods 6 15 for any reaction involving heterogeneous catalysts the available surface area for active catalytic sites and their structural chemical electronic states are important variables to consider it is well recognized that nanoscale catalysts can provide significant improvements over conventional solids due to their high surface volume ratios and high chemical activities however the widespread use of nanomaterials is limited in real life applications because of challenges related to their environmental proliferation reusability recovery and safety these issues can be addressed by anchoring catalytic nanoparticles on larger solids in which case the available surface area of nanocatalyst may be significantly constrained by the morphology of the underlying solid our research group has extensively investigated how these limitations can be overcome by durable attachment of functional nanoparticles on bio mimetic hierarchical membranes that can pack exceptionally high density of surface active nano catalytic particles into compact space which can be safely deployed in flowing water 16 22 a very effective architecture for aqueous environments is a high porosity foam made of inert carbon which is enriched with strongly anchored carpets of carbon nanotubes that are in turn activated with selected catalytic nanoparticles in this study we have used this architecture to build three types of palladium based nano catalysts these have been used to degrade a model emerging contaminant atrazine atrazine chemically known as 6 chloro n ethyl n 1 methylethyl 1 3 5 triazine 2 4 diamine or 2 chloro 4 ethylamino 6 isopropylamino 1 3 5 triazine has a chemical formula of c8h14cln5 and a molecular weight of 215 1 its solubility in water at 20 c is 30 mg l it is a triazine herbicide that inhibits photosynthetic electron transport and is commonly used for controlling the growth of weed on various crops such as wheat sugarcane guava corn sorghum and a wide range of grasses it is widely used in the united states maybe about 64 75 million pounds per year 23 24 as an herbicide atrazine is directly applied to the soil during the pre planting process and due to its solubility in water it can easily migrate into the ground and surface waters moreover it has very low natural biodegradability and persists in the environment once introduced due to its potential ecological and health effects the usepa has recommended that the maximum contamination level of atrazine in drinking water should not exceed 3 μg l or ppb 24 25 the adsorption of atrazine on adsorbents is not very effective due to its low adsorption ability it is therefore of interest to treat it using biological oxidative reductive or catalytic techniques as reported by earlier investigators 10 15 reducing agents reported include photocatlytic oxides zerovalent iron zvi and palladium 10 11 13 there have been an earlier report 10 of pd catalyst on polypyrrole coated cellulose fibers tested on various contaminants in aerobic conditions it was shown that while some of the other contaminants could be degraded atrazine was extremely persistent in aerobic conditions investigations on electro catalytic hydrogen dehalogenation of atrazine using pd containing bimetallic catalysts 14 indicate need for certain threshold currents in this paper we have investigated the possibility of using pd based nanocatalysts in robust reusable structures to degrade atrazine without any electric field or light activation three nanoparticles tested are pure metallic palladium pd nps palladium oxide coated pd pdo nps and silver coated palladium ag pd nps each supported on hierarchical carbon supports in the presence of hydrogen anaerobic conditions structural and chemical properties of the hierarchical solid material were investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps respectively liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy lc ms techniques were used to analyse the degradation kinetic rates and intermediate products formed during degradation 2 experimental 2 1 materials and chemicals the chemical reagents used in this study were of analytical grade and consumed without further purification these include atrazine c8h14cln5

teflon lined butyl rubber stoppers ptfe lined of size 20 mm and aluminium crimp were purchased from wheaton inc and ptfe syringe filters supelco were used other materials include de ionized water di water and laboratory grade gases that include 5 h2 balance n2 the atrazine stock solution of 100 μg ml concentration was prepared by dissolving 5 mg of atrazine in 50 ml methanol 2 2 fabrication of substrates and nano catalysts the substrates used in this study are carpet like arrays of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes cnt grown on the surfaces of carbon foam reticulated vitreous carbon or rvc foams provided by ultramet cnt arrays are grown using a two step technique discussed in earlier publications 16 17 the first step involves microwave plasma deposition of silica film on the porous foam surface this is followed by thermal chemical vapour deposition cvd of carbon nanotube arrays using floating catalyst technique these cnt coated foams are used as supports to grow palladium nanoparticles pd np using liquid phase synthetic approach elaborated in earlier papers 18 19 this technique involves soaking the cnt coated substrate in tetra amine palladium solution and subsequently heat treating in three stages i drying at 100 c ii calcination at 400 c in oxygen deficient inert atmosphere ar and iii final reduction and annealing at 450 c in reducing environment containing hydrogen in ar as the carrier gas this produces base metallic pd with average particle size of 10 15 nm the palladium oxide coated nanoparticles were prepared by thermally oxidizing the pd nps by heating them in ambient environment at 250 c for 2 h the ag pd bimetallic nanoparticles were fabricated by taking the base pd cnt foam materials and subsequently depositing silver films on them using a liquid phase approach deposition of silver was done by infiltrating the cnt foam supported pd np s with agno3 precursor solution and subsequently heating them at 40 c using dimethyl siloxane dms as reducing agent and sodium citrate as capping agent more details of the ag coating process are available in earlier publication 20 2 3 batch degradation studies catalytic materials compared in this study are i rvc foam ii cnt rvc foam iii pd cnt rvc foam iv pdo cnt rvc foam and v ag pd on cnt rvc foam they were tested in batch reactors consisting of 160 ml glass serum bottles the palladium based catalyst supports pd cnt pdo cnt and ag pd cnt on rvc foams were rinsed in 2 propanol and water subsequently two samples each of size ø 8 mm x 5 mm and total weight 25 mg total of 50 mg of solid which contains about 0 15 0 16 mg of pd were attached to the inside wall of the serum bottle using double sided carbon tape approximately 80 ml of 5 v v methanol in milli q water was added to the reactors maintaining the solution to headspace ratio of 50 50 the ph was monitored using a ph meter every 20 min and stayed within a slightly acidic range of 6 7 6 9 the reactors were sealed with teflon lined butyl rubber stoppers and aluminium crimps and then treated in two ways in one set of experiments they were sealed with ambient air in another set they were purged with high purity hydrogen nitrogen mixture 5 h2 and a balance n2 for approximately 30 min atrazine stock solution was injected into each reactor initial atrazine conc 1 μg ml 1 or 4 63 μm initial atrazine amount 0 463 μmol in 100 ml using a gas tight syringe the reactors were then placed on an end over end rotary shaker at room temperature 60 rpm 30 inclination the bottles were placed on the rotator at an inclination such that the solid samples attached on the walls of the reactors remained immersed in liquid phase at all times during rotation a blank reactor without any support or catalyst material was also investigated aliquot samples of 2 ml were derived from the bottles using a syringe at specified time intervals 20 min samples collected in the syringe at different reaction times were filtered using disposable ptfe syringe filters initially a 1 ml aliquot sample was discarded by running it through the filter in order to saturate the filter and then the remaining liquid sample was collected through the saturated filter in a 2 ml vial for hplc analysis 2 3 1 internal standard d5 atrazine an internal standard was added to the aliquot samples collected in a 2 ml vial for high performance liquid chromatography hplc quantification in this study a deuterated atrazine d5 atrazine compound was used as an internal standard for atrazine analysis stock solution of d5 atrazine was prepared to obtain the concentration 10 μg ml in 65 v v methanol and 2 mm acetic acid 50 μl of d5 atrazine stock solution 10 μg ml was carefully measured using an automatic micro pipette and added to each vial having 1 ml solution the concentration of internal standard in each vial was maintained at 0 5 μg ml 2 3 2 standard concentration analysis for analytical purposes a standard concentration of atrazine was studied for concentrations ranging from 0 01 μg ml to 1 μg ml ppm the standard solutions were prepared in 10 ml vials by adding the appropriate amount of atrazine stock solution in 5 v v methanol in milli q water 1 ml solution from each standard was collected in small vials and a known amount of internal standard was added to this for quantitative hplc analysis 2 3 3 chemical analysis hplc atrazine in water was analysed by using a waters micromass quattro micro equipped with a mass spectrometer for liquid chromatography lc ms and an auto sampler the hplc column was a restek biphenyl column pinnacle db biphenyl column of dimensions 100 2 1 mm2 1 9 μm and temperature was set to 50 c a mixture of water and methanol containing 2 mm acetic acid nh4oac was used as the mobile phase the ratio of methanol to reagent water containing 2 mm acetic acid was maintained at 10 90 v v for atrazine analysis the flow rate of the pump was set at 0 3 ml min and the actual sample injection volume was 20 μl each run was conducted for 24 mins the method detection limit for atrazine was 0 5 ng ml selective ion reaction monitoring sir was carried out for pure atrazine and the fragment ion spectra was used for ms ms analysis sir for all possible metabolites of atrazine was carried out using analyte solution to determine their formation due to the degradation of atrazine the liquid analyte samples were analysed in the multiple reaction mode mrm using the fragment ions spectra for ms ms analysis of atrazine and the possible metabolite daughter product compounds the catalytic degradation of atrazine is known to produce various derivative metabolite or daughter products and possible pathways for atrazine degradation during hydrogenated and hydroxylated reactions are discussed in the literature 11 13 in this study daughter products from our samples were detected and quantified using lc ms analysis and possible degradation pathways proposed an internal standard d5 atrazine was used to quantify the peak intensities of the compounds in the hplc analysis 3 results and discussions 3 1 microstructure of the hierarchical catalytic materials fig 1 depicts scanning electron microscope sem images of pd nps deposited on cnt foam supports cnt enrichment on the surface enables high loading of pd nanoparticles in compact space the sem images show uniformly distributed pd nps fig 2 a shows the palladium nanoparticles that were oxidized at 250 c fig 2 b shows the microstructure of silver coated pd nanoparticles ag pd on cnt foam structures these figures indicate that the distribution of nanoparticles are very similar in the three materials the difference lies in surface chemical states as discussed in the later section 3 2 atrazine degradation fig 3 shows a typical total ion current tic chromatogram acquired from the full scan mode in lc ms and the graph shows the mass scan data collected over time from this plot the atrazine compound is obtained at retention time of 8 mins using the above mentioned hplc method fig 3b shows the multiple reaction monitoring mrm analysis modes that show the mass separation scan acquired in the ms experiment the mrm peak acquired at 216 2 represents protonated atrazine ionization μ 1 of atrazine and the mrm peak acquired at 221 1 represents protonated d5 atrazine ionization μ 1 of d5 atrazine the ratio of atrazine peak area to d5 atrazine peak area is utilized here to control the run to run variability in injection and ionization intensity of hplc similarly other mass compounds were determined using sir mode and acquired using mrm mode calibration curves were obtained for every experiment from standard solution analysis by plotting the area ratios of atrazine and d5 atrazine peaks with the known concentrations the curve showed excellent linearity with the regression coefficient of r2 0 999 this curve equation was used for determining the concentration of atrazine in the water samples fig 4 shows the degradation kinetics of atrazine from an initial concentration of 1 μg ml under two different conditions with and without h2 purging obtained from cnt foam pd cnt foam and control reactors it is clear from fig 4 that the control reactor shows no significant degradation or removal of atrazine under any condition for reactors containing cnt foam structures without h2 purging there is small but detectable amount of atrazine reduction 30 the pd cnt catalysts without h2 show a similar effect of close to 30 atrazine removal this reduction in concentration can be attributed to the adsorption of atrazine on the nanostructured surfaces cnt and or pd cnt the base cnt foam reactor with hydrogen but without pd shows a similar removal rate as its non h2 counterpart attributed to adsorption however when samples decorated with pd nano catalysts are used in the presence of h2 very noticeable reduction of atrazine is observed this indicates that the presence of h2 along with pd nanocatalyst is needed to degrade the atrazine which agrees with earlier reports in the literature 13 14 the ph is important in atrazine degradation reactions and was monitored periodically and observed to remain slightly acidic in the 6 7 6 9 range fig 5 shows with greater detail the influence of surface chemical states of pd np on degradation kinetics of atrazine in the presence of h2 it can be seen that each of the three catalysts investigated pd cnt pdo cnt and ag pd cnt foam show rapid degradation metallic pd cnt shows 50 degradation in about 25 mins and complete degradation in less than 120 mins oxide coated pdo cnt and silver coated ag pd cnt samples show further increase in catalytic degradation rate with the pdo nanoparticles being the fastest 50 degradation in 11 5 min and complete degradation within 40 min it is worth noting is that earlier studies that have compiled atrazine degradation rate by nanoparticles 13 15 including alloys containing pd have indicated much slower degradation rates the fastest results 15 indicate incomplete removal 20 remaining even after 12 h of treatment while it is difficult to make quantitative comparisons in terms of pd atomic sites available in each case since such analyses are not available for earlier alloys but it is absolutely clear that the robust hierarchical nanostructures of this study show very significantly improved atrazine degradation rates with complete reduction below detection levels in approximately 40 80 and 120 min respectively this underscores the future potential of these types of hierarchical hybrid design for nanocatalyst devices 3 3 surface chemical states of nanocatalysts before and after atrazine exposure detailed surface chemical analysis was performed on the nanoparticles using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps xps scans were performed before and after use in the reactor in order to monitor any changes in surface chemistry during use all samples pd pdo and ag pd nps on cnt foam supports were rinsed with methanol and water and allowed to dry for up to 48 h in air the chemical state of metallic pd cnt samples for as prepared and used catalyst is shown in fig 6 a the pd 3d5 2 peak at 335 3 ev for pd cnt sample remains unchanged after atrazine degradation fig 6b shows the fine scan of pd 3d peak obtained from pdo250 c sample before and after atrazine degradation it can be observed that the partially oxidized pdo sample reduced to fully metallic state after degradation as the pd 3d 5 2 peak of pd2 at 336 9 ev shifts towards the 335 3 0 1 ev indicating release of surface oxide for the ag pd sample the chemical states of both ag and pd in ag pd cnt samples remained unchanged after atrazine degradation hence not shown here 3 4 daughter products and proposed degradation pathways degradation products daughter products of atrazine in the presence of palladium nanocatalysts and hydrogen with each nano catalyst were monitored using liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy lcms detectable daughter products observed are shown in fig 7 these include significant amounts of dechlorinated atrazine and deisopropyl dechlorinated atrazine in addition trace amounts of de ethyl dechlorinated atrazine and de ethyl deisopropyl dechlorinated atrazine were also detected quantities too small to be quantified this indicates that the degradation of atrazine yielded a dechlorinated atrazine compound as the major intermediate product in all cases its increase correlating very well with decrease in atrazine concentration formation of trace amounts of further degradation products at the later stages indicates that eventually the dechlorinated atrazine would be further broken down to smaller molecules possible degradation mechanism has been proposed based on these results fig 8 shows daughter products of atrazine when zero valent pd pd np and ag coated pd np catalysts are used in the presence of h2 there may be more than one intermediate pathways as indicated but the most quantifiable degradation product observed is dechlorinated atrazine which also agrees with the discussions in the literature 13 further reduction of dechlorinated atrazine to de isopropyl de chlorinated atrazine was observed in trace amounts which would finally lead to formation of guanmine in trace amounts indicating to path 2 in fig 8 as one possible pathway additionally traces of de ethyl de chlorinated atrazine were also observed indicating some reduction through pathway 1 in summary zero valent palladium np in the presence of h2 will cause atrazine to first reduce to dechlorinated atrazine followed by other products the degradation mechanism presumably involves steps that include dissociative adsorption of reactant species on the surface of the pd chemical reaction between these intermediate adsorbed species forming the reduced product including hcl and finally desorption of the final products from the catalyst surface and or further degradation of the adsorbed intermediate species into the smaller daughter products the degradation mechanism of surface oxidized pdo may involve additional pathways compared to metallic pd and ag pd catalysts it was observed that with pdo layer in the presence of h2 the degradation of atrazine is significantly faster and the prominent daughter product dechlorinated atrazine is smaller fig 7c this indicates that there will be additional degradation products such as hydroxylated atrazine 12 13 which is further supported by the observation noted in the earlier section that the oxide layer from the pdo surface is removed after exposure to atrazine resulting in reduced pd after use based on these observations it appears that of the nanoparticle surface has oxidized pd there may be additional breakdown mechanism s for atrazine through hydroxylated products as proposed in fig 9 in addition to the degradation mechanisms proposed in fig 9 to form dechlorinated atrazine 4 conclusions in this study pd pdo and ag pd on hierarchical carbon structures were used as catalysts in the presence of hydrogen gas for degradation of a model emerging contaminant atrazine in water it was demonstrated that all three nanomaterials could completely degrade atrazine in water without the need for electrical or optical stimuli among the three types of catalysts tested pdo has the highest activity followed by ag pd and pure pd nanoparticles the atrazine initially transformed to form dechlorinated atrazine and de ethyl deisopropyl dechlorinated atrazine this architecture of catalyst particles attached to larger hierarchical carbon supports form durable hybrid solids that can be easily introduced in and out of water without detectable damage such structures may therefore provide a nonpolluting reusable and cost effective solution for the removal of pollutants from contaminated water acknowledgements financial support from the following programs are acknowledged ohio third frontier program national

selected catalytic nanoparticles in this study we have used this architecture to build three types of palladium based nano catalysts these have been used to degrade a model emerging contaminant atrazine atrazine chemically known as 6 chloro n ethyl n 1 methylethyl 1 3 5 triazine 2 4 diamine or 2 chloro 4 ethylamino 6 isopropylamino 1 3 5 triazine has a chemical formula of c8h14cln5 and a molecular weight of 215 1 its solubility in water at 20 c is 30 mg l it is a triazine herbicide that inhibits photosynthetic electron transport and is commonly used for controlling the growth of weed on various crops such as wheat sugarcane guava corn sorghum and a wide range of grasses it is widely used in the united states maybe about 64 75 million pounds per year 23 24 as an herbicide atrazine is directly applied to the soil during the pre planting process and due to its solubility in water it can easily migrate into the ground and surface waters moreover it has very low natural biodegradability and persists in the environment once introduced due to its potential ecological and health effects the usepa has recommended that the maximum contamination level of atrazine in drinking water should not exceed 3 μg l or ppb 24 25 the adsorption of atrazine on adsorbents is not very effective due to its low adsorption ability it is therefore of interest to treat it using biological oxidative reductive or catalytic techniques as reported by earlier investigators 10 15 reducing agents reported include photocatlytic oxides zerovalent iron zvi and palladium 10 11 13 there have been an earlier report 10 of pd catalyst on polypyrrole coated cellulose fibers tested on various contaminants in aerobic conditions it was shown that while some of the other contaminants could be degraded atrazine was extremely persistent in aerobic conditions investigations on electro catalytic hydrogen dehalogenation of atrazine using pd containing bimetallic catalysts 14 indicate need for certain threshold currents in this paper we have investigated the possibility of using pd based nanocatalysts in robust reusable structures to degrade atrazine without any electric field or light activation three nanoparticles tested are pure metallic palladium pd nps palladium oxide coated pd pdo nps and silver coated palladium ag pd nps each supported on hierarchical carbon supports in the presence of hydrogen anaerobic conditions structural and chemical properties of the hierarchical solid material were investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps respectively liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy lc ms techniques were used to analyse the degradation kinetic rates and intermediate products formed during degradation 2 experimental 2 1 materials and chemicals the chemical reagents used in this study were of analytical grade and consumed without further purification these include atrazine c8h14cln5

teflon lined butyl rubber stoppers ptfe lined of size 20 mm and aluminium crimp were purchased from wheaton inc and ptfe syringe filters supelco were used other materials include de ionized water di water and laboratory grade gases that include 5 h2 balance n2 the atrazine stock solution of 100 μg ml concentration was prepared by dissolving 5 mg of atrazine in 50 ml methanol 2 2 fabrication of substrates and nano catalysts the substrates used in this study are carpet like arrays of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes cnt grown on the surfaces of carbon foam reticulated vitreous carbon or rvc foams provided by ultramet cnt arrays are grown using a two step technique discussed in earlier publications 16 17 the first step involves microwave plasma deposition of silica film on the porous foam surface this is followed by thermal chemical vapour deposition cvd of carbon nanotube arrays using floating catalyst technique these cnt coated foams are used as supports to grow palladium nanoparticles pd np using liquid phase synthetic approach elaborated in earlier papers 18 19 this technique involves soaking the cnt coated substrate in tetra amine palladium solution and subsequently heat treating in three stages i drying at 100 c ii calcination at 400 c in oxygen deficient inert atmosphere ar and iii final reduction and annealing at 450 c in reducing environment containing hydrogen in ar as the carrier gas this produces base metallic pd with average particle size of 10 15 nm the palladium oxide coated nanoparticles were prepared by thermally oxidizing the pd nps by heating them in ambient environment at 250 c for 2 h the ag pd bimetallic nanoparticles were fabricated by taking the base pd cnt foam materials and subsequently depositing silver films on them using a liquid phase approach deposition of silver was done by infiltrating the cnt foam supported pd np s with agno3 precursor solution and subsequently heating them at 40 c using dimethyl siloxane dms as reducing agent and sodium citrate as capping agent more details of the ag coating process are available in earlier publication 20 2 3 batch degradation studies catalytic materials compared in this study are i rvc foam ii cnt rvc foam iii pd cnt rvc foam iv pdo cnt rvc foam and v ag pd on cnt rvc foam they were tested in batch reactors consisting of 160 ml glass serum bottles the palladium based catalyst supports pd cnt pdo cnt and ag pd cnt on rvc foams were rinsed in 2 propanol and water subsequently two samples each of size ø 8 mm x 5 mm and total weight 25 mg total of 50 mg of solid which contains about 0 15 0 16 mg of pd were attached to the inside wall of the serum bottle using double sided carbon tape approximately 80 ml of 5 v v methanol in milli q water was added to the reactors maintaining the solution to headspace ratio of 50 50 the ph was monitored using a ph meter every 20 min and stayed within a slightly acidic range of 6 7 6 9 the reactors were sealed with teflon lined butyl rubber stoppers and aluminium crimps and then treated in two ways in one set of experiments they were sealed with ambient air in another set they were purged with high purity hydrogen nitrogen mixture 5 h2 and a balance n2 for approximately 30 min atrazine stock solution was injected into each reactor initial atrazine conc 1 μg ml 1 or 4 63 μm initial atrazine amount 0 463 μmol in 100 ml using a gas tight syringe the reactors were then placed on an end over end rotary shaker at room temperature 60 rpm 30 inclination the bottles were placed on the rotator at an inclination such that the solid samples attached on the walls of the reactors remained immersed in liquid phase at all times during rotation a blank reactor without any support or catalyst material was also investigated aliquot samples of 2 ml were derived from the bottles using a syringe at specified time intervals 20 min samples collected in the syringe at different reaction times were filtered using disposable ptfe syringe filters initially a 1 ml aliquot sample was discarded by running it through the filter in order to saturate the filter and then the remaining liquid sample was collected through the saturated filter in a 2 ml vial for hplc analysis 2 3 1 internal standard d5 atrazine an internal standard was added to the aliquot samples collected in a 2 ml vial for high performance liquid chromatography hplc quantification in this study a deuterated atrazine d5 atrazine compound was used as an internal standard for atrazine analysis stock solution of d5 atrazine was prepared to obtain the concentration 10 μg ml in 65 v v methanol and 2 mm acetic acid 50 μl of d5 atrazine stock solution 10 μg ml was carefully measured using an automatic micro pipette and added to each vial having 1 ml solution the concentration of internal standard in each vial was maintained at 0 5 μg ml 2 3 2 standard concentration analysis for analytical purposes a standard concentration of atrazine was studied for concentrations ranging from 0 01 μg ml to 1 μg ml ppm the standard solutions were prepared in 10 ml vials by adding the appropriate amount of atrazine stock solution in 5 v v methanol in milli q water 1 ml solution from each standard was collected in small vials and a known amount of internal standard was added to this for quantitative hplc analysis 2 3 3 chemical analysis hplc atrazine in water was analysed by using a waters micromass quattro micro equipped with a mass spectrometer for liquid chromatography lc ms and an auto sampler the hplc column was a restek biphenyl column pinnacle db biphenyl column of dimensions 100 2 1 mm2 1 9 μm and temperature was set to 50 c a mixture of water and methanol containing 2 mm acetic acid nh4oac was used as the mobile phase the ratio of methanol to reagent water containing 2 mm acetic acid was maintained at 10 90 v v for atrazine analysis the flow rate of the pump was set at 0 3 ml min and the actual sample injection volume was 20 μl each run was conducted for 24 mins the method detection limit for atrazine was 0 5 ng ml selective ion reaction monitoring sir was carried out for pure atrazine and the fragment ion spectra was used for ms ms analysis sir for all possible metabolites of atrazine was carried out using analyte solution to determine their formation due to the degradation of atrazine the liquid analyte samples were analysed in the multiple reaction mode mrm using the fragment ions spectra for ms ms analysis of atrazine and the possible metabolite daughter product compounds the catalytic degradation of atrazine is known to produce various derivative metabolite or daughter products and possible pathways for atrazine degradation during hydrogenated and hydroxylated reactions are discussed in the literature 11 13 in this study daughter products from our samples were detected and quantified using lc ms analysis and possible degradation pathways proposed an internal standard d5 atrazine was used to quantify the peak intensities of the compounds in the hplc analysis 3 results and discussions 3 1 microstructure of the hierarchical catalytic materials fig 1 depicts scanning electron microscope sem images of pd nps deposited on cnt foam supports cnt enrichment on the surface enables high loading of pd nanoparticles in compact space the sem images show uniformly distributed pd nps fig 2 a shows the palladium nanoparticles that were oxidized at 250 c fig 2 b shows the microstructure of silver coated pd nanoparticles ag pd on cnt foam structures these figures indicate that the distribution of nanoparticles are very similar in the three materials the difference lies in surface chemical states as discussed in the later section 3 2 atrazine degradation fig 3 shows a typical total ion current tic chromatogram acquired from the full scan mode in lc ms and the graph shows the mass scan data collected over time from this plot the atrazine compound is obtained at retention time of 8 mins using the above mentioned hplc method fig 3b shows the multiple reaction monitoring mrm analysis modes that show the mass separation scan acquired in the ms experiment the mrm peak acquired at 216 2 represents protonated atrazine ionization μ 1 of atrazine and the mrm peak acquired at 221 1 represents protonated d5 atrazine ionization μ 1 of d5 atrazine the ratio of atrazine peak area to d5 atrazine peak area is utilized here to control the run to run variability in injection and ionization intensity of hplc similarly other mass compounds were determined using sir mode and acquired using mrm mode calibration curves were obtained for every experiment from standard solution analysis by plotting the area ratios of atrazine and d5 atrazine peaks with the known concentrations the curve showed excellent linearity with the regression coefficient of r2 0 999 this curve equation was used for determining the concentration of atrazine in the water samples fig 4 shows the degradation kinetics of atrazine from an initial concentration of 1 μg ml under two different conditions with and without h2 purging obtained from cnt foam pd cnt foam and control reactors it is clear from fig 4 that the control reactor shows no significant degradation or removal of atrazine under any condition for reactors containing cnt foam structures without h2 purging there is small but detectable amount of atrazine reduction 30 the pd cnt catalysts without h2 show a similar effect of close to 30 atrazine removal this reduction in concentration can be attributed to the adsorption of atrazine on the nanostructured surfaces cnt and or pd cnt the base cnt foam reactor with hydrogen but without pd shows a similar removal rate as its non h2 counterpart attributed to adsorption however when samples decorated with pd nano catalysts are used in the presence of h2 very noticeable reduction of atrazine is observed this indicates that the presence of h2 along with pd nanocatalyst is needed to degrade the atrazine which agrees with earlier reports in the literature 13 14 the ph is important in atrazine degradation reactions and was monitored periodically and observed to remain slightly acidic in the 6 7 6 9 range fig 5 shows with greater detail the influence of surface chemical states of pd np on degradation kinetics of atrazine in the presence of h2 it can be seen that each of the three catalysts investigated pd cnt pdo cnt and ag pd cnt foam show rapid degradation metallic pd cnt shows 50 degradation in about 25 mins and complete degradation in less than 120 mins oxide coated pdo cnt and silver coated ag pd cnt samples show further increase in catalytic degradation rate with the pdo nanoparticles being the fastest 50 degradation in 11 5 min and complete degradation within 40 min it is worth noting is that earlier studies that have compiled atrazine degradation rate by nanoparticles 13 15 including alloys containing pd have indicated much slower degradation rates the fastest results 15 indicate incomplete removal 20 remaining even after 12 h of treatment while it is difficult to make quantitative comparisons in terms of pd atomic sites available in each case since such analyses are not available for earlier alloys but it is absolutely clear that the robust hierarchical nanostructures of this study show very significantly improved atrazine degradation rates with complete reduction below detection levels in approximately 40 80 and 120 min respectively this underscores the future potential of these types of hierarchical hybrid design for nanocatalyst devices 3 3 surface chemical states of nanocatalysts before and after atrazine exposure detailed surface chemical analysis was performed on the nanoparticles using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps xps scans were performed before and after use in the reactor in order to monitor any changes in surface chemistry during use all samples pd pdo and ag pd nps on cnt foam supports were rinsed with methanol and water and allowed to dry for up to 48 h in air the chemical state of metallic pd cnt samples for as prepared and used catalyst is shown in fig 6 a the pd 3d5 2 peak at 335 3 ev for pd cnt sample remains unchanged after atrazine degradation fig 6b shows the fine scan of pd 3d peak obtained from pdo250 c sample before and after atrazine degradation it can be observed that the partially oxidized pdo sample reduced to fully metallic state after degradation as the pd 3d 5 2 peak of pd2 at 336 9 ev shifts towards the 335 3 0 1 ev indicating release of surface oxide for the ag pd sample the chemical states of both ag and pd in ag pd cnt samples remained unchanged after atrazine degradation hence not shown here 3 4 daughter products and proposed degradation pathways degradation products daughter products of atrazine in the presence of palladium nanocatalysts and hydrogen with each nano catalyst were monitored using liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy lcms detectable daughter products observed are shown in fig 7 these include significant amounts of dechlorinated atrazine and deisopropyl dechlorinated atrazine in addition trace amounts of de ethyl dechlorinated atrazine and de ethyl deisopropyl dechlorinated atrazine were also detected quantities too small to be quantified this indicates that the degradation of atrazine yielded a dechlorinated atrazine compound as the major intermediate product in all cases its increase correlating very well with decrease in atrazine concentration formation of trace amounts of further degradation products at the later stages indicates that eventually the dechlorinated atrazine would be further broken down to smaller molecules possible degradation mechanism has been proposed based on these results fig 8 shows daughter products of atrazine when zero valent pd pd np and ag coated pd np catalysts are used in the presence of h2 there may be more than one intermediate pathways as indicated but the most quantifiable degradation product observed is dechlorinated atrazine which also agrees with the discussions in the literature 13 further reduction of dechlorinated atrazine to de isopropyl de chlorinated atrazine was observed in trace amounts which would finally lead to formation of guanmine in trace amounts indicating to path 2 in fig 8 as one possible pathway additionally traces of de ethyl de chlorinated atrazine were also observed indicating some reduction through pathway 1 in summary zero valent palladium np in the presence of h2 will cause atrazine to first reduce to dechlorinated atrazine followed by other products the degradation mechanism presumably involves steps that include dissociative adsorption of reactant species on the surface of the pd chemical reaction between these intermediate adsorbed species forming the reduced product including hcl and finally desorption of the final products from the catalyst surface and or further degradation of the adsorbed intermediate species into the smaller daughter products the degradation mechanism of surface oxidized pdo may involve additional pathways compared to metallic pd and ag pd catalysts it was observed that with pdo layer in the presence of h2 the degradation of atrazine is significantly faster and the prominent daughter product dechlorinated atrazine is smaller fig 7c this indicates that there will be additional degradation products such as hydroxylated atrazine 12 13 which is further supported by the observation noted in the earlier section that the oxide layer from the pdo surface is removed after exposure to atrazine resulting in reduced pd after use based on these observations it appears that of the nanoparticle surface has oxidized pd there may be additional breakdown mechanism s for atrazine through hydroxylated products as proposed in fig 9 in addition to the degradation mechanisms proposed in fig 9 to form dechlorinated atrazine 4 conclusions in this study pd pdo and ag pd on hierarchical carbon structures were used as catalysts in the presence of hydrogen gas for degradation of a model emerging contaminant atrazine in water it was demonstrated that all three nanomaterials could completely degrade atrazine in water without the need for electrical or optical stimuli among the three types of catalysts tested pdo has the highest activity followed by ag pd and pure pd nanoparticles the atrazine initially transformed to form dechlorinated atrazine and de ethyl deisopropyl dechlorinated atrazine this architecture of catalyst particles attached to larger hierarchical carbon supports form durable hybrid solids that can be easily introduced in and out of water without detectable damage such structures may therefore provide a nonpolluting reusable and cost effective solution for the removal of pollutants from contaminated water acknowledgements financial support from the following programs are acknowledged ohio third frontier program national

14507,clean water sources are quickly depleted since the industrial revolution due to climate change and overpopulation use of potable water for agricultural irrigation is under imminent threat therefore it is important to obtain irrigation water from alternative sources such as industrial wastewaters on the other hand industrial wastewaters have to be treated well otherwise they can pollute the environment and decrease the irrigation potential of soil membrane bioreactor mbr effluents of industrial wastewaters have a great potential to be used in agricultural irrigation in this study the permeates of nf270 and bw30 ro membranes were produced from mbr effluent discharged from wastewater treatment plant of itob organized industrial zone menderes izmir they were evaluated for their reuse in agricultural irrigation while doing this evaluation effect of operating pressure on water quality was also investigated it was found that the ro permeate is not suitable to reuse in irrigation on

food and agricultural organization fao in 2016 2 the use of wastewater for agricultural irrigation may decrease the amount of used potable water yet it would increase salinity damage soil quality and crop development 3 wastewater reclamation may be a good choice for this problem membrane bioreactor mbr is a process combining biological treatment with membrane filtration in a bioreactor it has superiority over conventional activated sludge system cass since it does not include sedimentation unit and gives less sludge production higher total suspended solid tss rejection and smaller footprint 4 since mbr effluent quality is higher than cass effluent it can be evaluated for the irrigation nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro processes can be used as post treatment after mbr process to produce water for agricultural irrigation it is suggested that pressure driven membrane processes can be used to treat secondary effluent of industrial wastewater in order to reuse it in agricultural irrigation since these membranes are capable of removing various monovalent and divalent ions from the solution and therefore can reduce salinity in water greatly there are various studies on the application of nf and ro processes for reclaiming wastewater in order to reuse in agricultural irrigation 5 7 bunani et al 6 experimented with ak bwro and ak swro membranes for municipal wastewater reclamation their findings indicated a certain blend ratio of the secondary treated municipal effluent and ro permeate can be used for agricultural irrigation shanmuganathan et al 5 also suggested a blend of nf and ro permeates when they worked with np 010 np 030 nf and wc ro membranes ro process is cost effective since phase change does not occur unlike thermal treatment processes 8 ro process is the most widely used desalination method for brackish water and seawater today and applications of the ro process are various mostly focused on purification and concentration ro process is also used as a pre treatment process for production of high pressure boiler feed water or ultrapure water applied before electrodeionization edi or ion exchange 9 main model of the mass transport in a nf membrane is represented by donnan steric pore model and dielectric exclusion 10 since pores are not media for solute transfer in dense membranes such as ro membranes main causes of mass transfer for ro membranes are size exclusion and charge exclusion 11 this situation causes a significant flux difference between nf and ro membranes even though the quality of permeate is better for ro dependency of permeate flux on the applied pressure for solution diffusion transport mechanism is shown by eq 1 shenvi 2015 1 j p l p δ p δ π where jp is the permeate flux lp is the water permeability a specific characteristic of a membrane δ p is the pressure difference between two sides of membrane and δ π is the osmotic pressure difference between feed and permeate solutions although increasing pressure increases irreversible fouling due to compression of foulants 12 increased flux and better salt rejection are often desired the scope of this study was to investigate the effects of pressure on the produced permeate from nf and ro membranes and evaluation of the product water for reuse in agricultural irrigation 2 methods 2 1 system configurations and experiments bw30 ro and nf270 membranes were used for this experimental study properties of these membranes are given in table 1 bw30 ro product of dow filmtec is a polyamide thin film ro membrane and provides a high rejection stability even with high tds in water the nf membrane nf270 is also produced by dow filmtec mwco of nf270 membrane is given between 200 400 da average mwco of nf270 is also determined by rohani et al as 330 da 4 and by kelewou et al as 257 da 15 13 14 studies were performed for a period of 4 h under the applied pressure of 10 and 20 bar for nf270 20 and 30 bar for bw30 ro permeate and feed samples were taken at each hour and analyzed for parameters related with irrigation quality concentrate and permeate flow rates are recorded in each half hour average results were used to obtain more reliable results experiments were performed in a container laboratory where a mini pilot scale membrane test system was placed in the wastewater treatment plant of itob organized industrial zone at menderes izmir turkey fig 1 flow scheme of the membrane test system was given in fig 2 2 2 characteristics of the feed water mbr effluent of the wastewater treatment plant of itob organized industrial zone located in menderes izmir turkey was used as the feed solution for nf and ro membranes after the treatment of industrial wastewater with mbr process as a secondary treatment mbr effluent stream was collected in a 500 l of storage tank the characteristics of the mbr effluent were given in table 2 2 3 calculation of performance parameters water recovery is calculated for each measurement of permeate and concentrate fluxes by using eq 2 2 w r j p l m 2 h j f l m 2 h where wr is the water recovery and the feed flux j f is the sum of permeate flux j p and concentrate flux j c permeate flux is experimentally calculated by using eq 3 3 j p l m 2 h q p l m i n a m 2 60 m i n 1 h where qp is the permeate flow rate and a is the active membrane area 2 6 m2 the concentrate flux is also calculated in the same way by using vc concentrate flow rate instead of vp all permeate fluxes are normalized at 25 c by using eq 4 4 j p a d j j p 1 03 t 25 where j p adj is the adjusted flux normalized at 25 c and t is temperature of permeate sample at which the tests are performed 15 observed rejection of any parameter is calculated by using eq 5 5 r c f c p c f 100 where r is the observed rejection cf is the parameter value in the membrane feed stream and cp is the parameter value in the permeate stream average rejections were calculated from average compositions of permeates and feed streams sodium hazard is the effect of sodium ion on soil hydraulic properties which can be identified by sodium adsorption ratio sar factor and its calculation method is given in eq 6 16 sar

dimensionless parameter similar to sar that shows the effect of potassium instead of sodium and it is calculated with the formula given in eq 7 though there is no agreement of safe par value water with a maximum par of 5 seems suitable to use in irrigation all concentration units for sar and par calculation are meq l 17 7 p a r k c a 2 m g 2 2 2 4 agricultural irrigation criteria table 3 shows the evaluation of chemical quality for irrigational water and includes standards stated by ministry of environment and urbanization of turkish republic 18 table 4 includes data given in table 3 and also some extra criteria stated by us environmental protection agency epa un food and agriculture organization fao and world health organization who given sar ec data in table 3 for determination of effect of irrigational water on soil permeability is visualized in graph fig 3 in fig 3 class iii area represents that this water may cause serious drop in infiltration and it is not useable for irrigation in class ii area this water may have some negative effects on infiltration but it can be used with caution on the other hand the water in class i area will have no harmful effects on infiltration 3 results and discussion flux is increased by 38 1 for nf270 33 4 for bw30 when the pressure was increased average permeate flux temperature and water recovery values are given in table 5 within the normalized flux values increasing applied pressure critically improved the permeate flux especially for nf270 membrane accordingly the percent water recovery increased with an increase in operating pressure both of these gains are essential for a membrane process therefore increasing pressure seems applicable in this manner rejection performance of nf270 and bw30 ro membranes for various parameters at different pressures were summarized in table 6 as shown in table 6 percent rejections for various parameters did not change significantly for the bw30 ro membrane but increasing pressure from 10 to 20 bar strongly influenced the solute rejections by nf270 probably due to less contact time of solutes with membrane surface since the flux was nearly doubled especially rejections of chloride and sodium ions were high and this makes the product water more suitable for agricultural irrigation it was seen that although most of the parameters make ro permeate more suitable for irrigation its low conductivity together with its sar values makes this water third class water due to decreasing soil permeability table 7 application of ro permeate directly for irrigation may create two problems very low mineral content due to its very high salt rejection would require extra remineralization step which might be unfeasible the soil must be fertilized since ro permeate would decrease the soil permeability and thus prevent the plant to draw sufficient nutrients from the soil the opposite situation was obtained for nf270 permeate as it does not have any harmful effect on soil permeability but high concentrations of sodium and chloride in nf 270 permeate can be harmful to the plants on the other hand increasing pressure from 10 to 20 bar improved the quality of nf270 permeate by decreasing especially concentrations of sodium and chloride ions in the product water this situation makes nf270 permeate obtained at 20 bar more suitable in agricultural irrigation for most of the plants except salinity sensitive ones such as most of the fruit trees 4 conclusions in this study the effect of applied pressure on the permeate quality of bw30 ro and nf270 membranes was investigated and their suitability for agricultural irrigation permeate flux decline was not observed during 4 h of experimental period when applied pressure was increased from 10 to 20 bar solute rejections by nf270 increased the permeate quality of ro membrane did not change much by the increase in applied pressure a continuous test will be run in next studies in order to see the effect of applied pressure on permeate flux and quality the bw30 ro permeate was considered to be not suitable to reuse for irrigation due to its high sar to ec ratio value this indicates that bw30 ro permeate may have possible negative effects on soil properties on the other hand nf270 permeate can be used for plants that have a tolerance for medium salinity levels working with nf270 membrane under 20 bar of operating pressure is a better option than operating at 10 bar since sar value of nf 270 permeate decreased significantly with increasing pressure on the other hand regarding scale up not only water quality but also specific energy consumption of the process and consequently treatment cost will be an important factor this should be also taken into account acknowledgments membrane test

rejection stability even with high tds in water the nf membrane nf270 is also produced by dow filmtec mwco of nf270 membrane is given between 200 400 da average mwco of nf270 is also determined by rohani et al as 330 da 4 and by kelewou et al as 257 da 15 13 14 studies were performed for a period of 4 h under the applied pressure of 10 and 20 bar for nf270 20 and 30 bar for bw30 ro permeate and feed samples were taken at each hour and analyzed for parameters related with irrigation quality concentrate and permeate flow rates are recorded in each half hour average results were used to obtain more reliable results experiments were performed in a container laboratory where a mini pilot scale membrane test system was placed in the wastewater treatment plant of itob organized industrial zone at menderes izmir turkey fig 1 flow scheme of the membrane test system was given in fig 2 2 2 characteristics of the feed water mbr effluent of the wastewater treatment plant of itob organized industrial zone located in menderes izmir turkey was used as the feed solution for nf and ro membranes after the treatment of industrial wastewater with mbr process as a secondary treatment mbr effluent stream was collected in a 500 l of storage tank the characteristics of the mbr effluent were given in table 2 2 3 calculation of performance parameters water recovery is calculated for each measurement of permeate and concentrate fluxes by using eq 2 2 w r j p l m 2 h j f l m 2 h where wr is the water recovery and the feed flux j f is the sum of permeate flux j p and concentrate flux j c permeate flux is experimentally calculated by using eq 3 3 j p l m 2 h q p l m i n a m 2 60 m i n 1 h where qp is the permeate flow rate and a is the active membrane area 2 6 m2 the concentrate flux is also calculated in the same way by using vc concentrate flow rate instead of vp all permeate fluxes are normalized at 25 c by using eq 4 4 j p a d j j p 1 03 t 25 where j p adj is the adjusted flux normalized at 25 c and t is temperature of permeate sample at which the tests are performed 15 observed rejection of any parameter is calculated by using eq 5 5 r c f c p c f 100 where r is the observed rejection cf is the parameter value in the membrane feed stream and cp is the parameter value in the permeate stream average rejections were calculated from average compositions of permeates and feed streams sodium hazard is the effect of sodium ion on soil hydraulic properties which can be identified by sodium adsorption ratio sar factor and its calculation method is given in eq 6 16 sar is used to compare the effect of sodium concentration of soil permeability by comparing it with divalent cation concentrations 6 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 potassium adsorption ratio par is a dimensionless parameter similar to sar that shows the effect of potassium instead of sodium and it is calculated with the formula given in eq 7 though there is no agreement of safe par value water with a maximum par of 5 seems suitable to use in irrigation all concentration units for sar and par calculation are meq l 17 7 p a r k c a 2 m g 2 2 2 4 agricultural irrigation criteria table 3 shows the evaluation of chemical quality for irrigational water and includes standards stated by ministry of environment and urbanization of turkish republic 18 table 4 includes data given in table 3 and also some extra criteria stated by us environmental protection agency epa un food and agriculture organization fao and world health organization who given sar ec data in table 3 for determination of effect of irrigational water on soil permeability is visualized in graph fig 3 in fig 3 class iii area represents that this water may cause serious drop in infiltration and it is not useable for irrigation in class ii area this water may have some negative effects on infiltration but it can be used with caution on the other hand the water in class i area will have no harmful effects on infiltration 3 results and discussion flux is increased by 38 1 for nf270 33 4 for bw30 when the pressure was increased average permeate flux temperature and water recovery values are given in table 5 within the normalized flux values increasing applied pressure critically improved the permeate flux especially for nf270 membrane accordingly the percent water recovery increased with an increase in operating pressure both of these gains are essential for a membrane process therefore increasing pressure seems applicable in this manner rejection performance of nf270 and bw30 ro membranes for various parameters at different pressures were summarized in table 6 as shown in table 6 percent rejections for various parameters did not change significantly for the bw30 ro membrane but increasing pressure from 10 to 20 bar strongly influenced the solute rejections by nf270 probably due to less contact time of solutes with membrane surface since the flux was nearly doubled especially rejections of chloride and sodium ions were high and this makes the product water more suitable for agricultural irrigation it was seen that although most of the parameters make ro permeate more suitable for irrigation its low conductivity together with its sar values makes this water third class water due to decreasing soil permeability table 7 application of ro permeate directly for irrigation may create two problems very low mineral content due to its very high salt rejection would require extra remineralization step which might be unfeasible the soil must be fertilized since ro permeate would decrease the soil permeability and thus prevent the plant to draw sufficient nutrients from the soil the opposite situation was obtained for nf270 permeate as it does not have any harmful effect on soil permeability but high concentrations of sodium and chloride in nf 270 permeate can be harmful to the plants on the other hand increasing pressure from 10 to 20 bar improved the quality of nf270 permeate by decreasing especially concentrations of sodium and chloride ions in the product water this situation makes nf270 permeate obtained at 20 bar more suitable in agricultural irrigation for most of the plants except salinity sensitive ones such as most of the fruit trees 4 conclusions in this study the effect of applied pressure on the permeate quality of bw30 ro and nf270 membranes was investigated and their suitability for agricultural irrigation permeate flux decline was not observed during 4 h of experimental period when applied pressure was increased from 10 to 20 bar solute rejections by nf270 increased the permeate quality of ro membrane did not change much by the increase in applied pressure a continuous test will be run in next studies in order to see the effect of applied pressure on permeate flux and quality the bw30 ro permeate was considered to be not suitable to reuse for irrigation due to its high sar to ec ratio value this indicates that bw30 ro permeate may have possible negative effects on soil properties on the other hand nf270 permeate can be used for plants that have a tolerance for medium salinity levels working with nf270 membrane under 20 bar of operating pressure is a better option than operating at 10 bar since sar value of nf 270 permeate decreased significantly with increasing pressure on the other hand regarding scale up not only water quality but also specific energy consumption of the process and consequently treatment cost will be an important factor this should be also taken into account acknowledgments membrane test

reaction nitrification temperature regime 1 introduction biological water filtration systems are a significant solution to the challenges of treating wastewater to enhance water quality the need for biological filtration is increasing in areas with high concentrations of total ammonia nitrogen content such as aquaculture agricultural runoff and industrial effluent discharge 1 4 traditional recirculating aquaculture systems ras are constantly engaged with operational challenges including water requirements compliance with discharge limits demand for product of high quality land use in coastal areas and discharge water quality to receiving surface waters 5 7 systems with recirculation technology have therefore gained wide popularity for effectively managing water reuse waste and pollutant treatment to address water quality and disease concerns 8 applications of recirculating systems and biofiltration technology have continued to be widely adopted for grow out systems brood stock production of larvae and fry including areas of wastewater and produced water 6 9 11 biofiltration systems are designed to use existing bacteria in water or seeded to accumulate micro bacteria organisms used in water treatment to maximize water reuse particularly in ras systems the process is also critical to functionality of recirculating systems to maintain water quality in sequence with other unit operations including solids capture aeration clarification and circulation 3 12 13 bacteria presence in biofiltration process oxidize toxic soluble waste including organic carbon and total ammonia nitrogen to a less harmful form produced in industrial wastewater and commercial ras 14 18 this process is also critical to the efficiency of industrial water treatment 16 efficiency of biofiltration in water treatment and ras systems makes it possible for commercial ras to compete with open ponds and net pens 19 3 4 commercial operations using large volumes of water including agricultural producers using ras systems are challenged by the need to treat recirculating water for reuse discharge of non treated water from such systems leads to release of water that is heavily loaded with nutrients including total ammonia nitrogen 20 a biofilter design and function primarily impacts the efficiency of water treatment in ras as a factor of production capacity and water discharge ras biofilter designs are determined by the efficiency to utilize grams of tan per cubic meter of media volume per day g m3 d or milligrams of tan per square meter of media surface area per

process includes ammonia concentration and temperature 22 26 effect of temperature in ras specifically preferred temperature for species raised impacts bacteria response to ammonia oxidation in the biofilter therefore the required temperature impacting the bacteria in oxidation of total ammonia nitrogen is significant in biofilter performance 27 28 11 4 however temperature studies have been viewed with a broad and varied perception of understanding the design and functionality of biofilters 29 5 4 30 6 temperature interactions with suspended bacteria have been reported in previous

detail for fixed film biofilters especially in a phase of growth that is dynamic 33 the process of tan utilization in biofiltration systems are divided into three stages first stage requires substrate diffusion through the fluid boundary layer leading to the biofilm the second stage requires substrate diffusion through the biofilm to the bacteria the final stage requires availability of nutrient to the bacteria within the biofilm 34 36 these steps are encompassed into a single kinetic model monod models are used for fixed film nitrification kinetics in biofiltration process which summarize the complex transport and enzyme reactions 37 6 38 stages of enzyme kinetics and reactions are also determined by the michaelis menton expression the expression is used to represent fixed film

biofilters understanding the temperature ramifications on acclimation of biofilters and the reported findings will contribute to the potential development of best management practices for commercial water treatment with high substrate loading particularly in ras and other applications of water quality management the objectives were to determine 1 transient temperature impact on acclimating biofilter ammonia oxidation at different steady state temperatures 2 to determine biofilter ammonia oxidation at diurnal temperature regimes mimicking daily cyclical temperature patterns 2 materials

concentration the y intercept c of the equation was normalized to zero slope of the direct linear regression eq 4 for tan oxidation rates at varying temperature regimes determined the biofilter performance for each specified temperature regime a batch system of tanks with custom designed intake airlift attached to biofilters fig 1 b for water flow and aeration of the biofilter was used for this study the airlifts were made out of polyvinyl chloride pvc 1 2 diameter 10 length tubes biofilters were made of acrylic tubes 2 diameter 7 5 height with base and a filter screen top inflow and outflow screens had a porosity of 6 106 μm2 media bed volume was 1 3 10 4 m3 a compressor central pneumatic s 34843 was used to supply air for airlift recirculation and aeration in the tanks water recirculation rate by the airlift through the biofilter was 0 7 liters per minute thirty six tanks 40 l capacity each were prepared in the laboratory nine of which were used to perform randomized replicate arrangement in the experiments three tanks 3 3 arrangement were assigned to each of the three temperature regimes specific nitrification polyethylene media enhanced nitrification en media aquaculture systems technologies llc new orleans la beads with a diameter of 3 mm fig 1a were used for the biofilters fig 1b in the tanks surface area of biofilm was assumed to include the media

typically used for the filtration bed was considered moderate at 1150 1475 m2 m 3 3 2 1 bead inoculation pre acclimation beads in the biofilters were inoculated before experimental sampling beads were placed in a single container at a fixed temperature for inoculation a tank was loaded with synthetic substrate nh4cl 5 mg liter and other trace nutrients nahco3 100 mg l k2hpo4 15 mg l cacl2 15 mg l mgso47h2o 100 mg l fecl36h2o 5 mg l with high purity 99 5 chemical concentration for bacteria growth and uniform loading at the start of experiments all chemicals were purchased from vwr international vwr com and the loading concentrations were adopted after wortman and wheaton 4 media was inoculated with seeded bacteria from an existing aquarium tank inoculation and start up lasted three weeks inoculation temperature was set at 25 c which is considered optimal for growth of nitrifying bacteria 19 the ph was also maintained at 7 0 8 6 33 36 oxygen concentration was maintained above 6 g m 3 in the aeration process for each tank it was considered to be above limiting concentration levels 5 39 2 2 biofilter acclimation the media was loaded in acrylic biofilter columns with attached pvc airlifts biofilters were acclimated at three steady state temperatures 13 c 20 c 30 c in the tanks automated temperature control maintained and collected data for duration test media acclimation at the three steady state temperatures lasted for 3 days 2 3 sanitization biofilter cylinders acrylic housing were sanitized between steady state and diurnal tests to minimize in situ nitrification proven to be problematic in similar studies 3 6 at the completion of each experimental temperature test beads were taken out of the cylinder and set aside in individual 20 l containers to maintain consistency of the biofilms during the sanitization stage sanitization took 2 h for all tanks to be complete the reactors were washed with diluted 1250 parts per million ppm bleach chlorine water with all the pieces taken apart scrubbed out and dropped into the tanks for bleach water circulation in the tank tanks were each loaded with 50 ml of concentrated bleach clorox per 40 l tank achieving a concentration of 1250 parts per million ppm of bleach per liter of water in each tank chilling pumps were activated to circulate diluted bleach within the tanks and through the heat exchangers which had the potential of bacteria growth on the inside the system was allowed to run for 2 h with the chlorine after which the tanks were drained using electric motor operated suction pumps biofilter cylinders were taken out of the drained tanks and further rinsed out with deionized distilled water before loading the beads into the cylinders deionized distilled water was used to rinse the biofilters cylinders out the tanks were flushed with water chlorine 0 2 ppm using automated pumps in the system this effectively eliminated residual bleach water in the heat exchangers the loaded cylinders with beads were repositioned in the tanks tanks were refilled with the synthetic substrate total time for cleaning was approximately 2½ hours 2 4 temperature control tanks were setup and controlled for desired temperatures using a customized temperature feedback control loop program system this was executed every 5 min while the program measured the temperature approximately every 3 s average readings of the data were computed and displayed on the computer monitor the computer adjusted the temperature as set for each batch of tanks 2 5 experimental design and sample analysis tanks were loaded with chemical feed stock 5 g m 3 at the start of the experiment tank temperature regime profiles were arranged in triplicates for each regime at 13 c 20 c and 30 c post acclimation for 72 h for the duration of the experiment the following experiments table 1 were performed regime profiles were recorded for temperatures 13 c 20 c 30 c with minimal temperature deviations 0 1 c changes in concentration for ammonia oxidized over 72 h 3 days were recorded and graphed for 13 c 20 c and 30 c steady state regimes concentrations from the data were graphed to determine tan removal rates per day for each of the three steady state temperature regimes in the second experiment the tanks were set to sinusoidal diurnal temperatures 20 3 c and 30 3 c fig 2 experiments lasted for 3 days samples s were collected at six hour intervals over the 72 h period with four samples per day as performed in previous studies by malone and pfeiffer 6 sample analysis determined the change in total ammonia concentration with time a spectrophotometer thermospectronic genesys 20 thermo electron corporation product krackeler scientific inc albany ny was used for sample analysis differences in ammonia decay between tanks for temperature regimes were determined using the t test for observed data all analyses were performed within 2 h of collecting the samples to reduce any reaction potential from suspended film bacteria samples were collected in disposable 50 ml centrifuge tubes and immediately analyzed substrate utilized was the difference between initial loading and final concentration after sampling reaction order for substrate utilization was assumed to be in a transition from zero order where the substrate is much more than the bacteria removal rate to first order and second order reaction kinetics as the bacterial biomass increased direct linear regression dlr lines were fitted to all data sets to determine the tau t values even though the biofilters were assumed to be in a dynamic phase the slopes for each temperature regime were interpreted from the data a statistical t test analysis compared substrate utilization rates between temperature regimes tan removal rates were normalized using intercepts forced to indicate initial removal rates in the dynamic bacterial growth process only for computational purposes value of findings were calculated from the sum of square errors sse to determine the value of differences in result analysis minimum substrate concentration required to sustain a steady state biofilm was maintained for the experiment 38 40 41 ammonia oxidation data were expressed in a direct linear relation for each temperature regime 13 c 20 c 30 c 20 3 c and 30 3 c 3 results results put forward relevant information that was not previously considered in a dynamic seeded acclimating biofiltration process the growing need for commercial application of biofilters in water treatment and recirculating systems particularly may further benefit from continued research in this area however results from this study give insight to seeded acclimating biofilter ammonia oxidation for short term temperature variations at steady state and sinusoidal temperature perturbations the following discussion outlines data analyses at different temperature regimes 3 1 steady state temperature tan utilization rates total ammonia oxidation fig 3 coefficient at 13 c steady state had a mean tan slope m 0 107 with a correlation coefficient of r2 0 930 the substrate utilization rate at 20 c steady state also had a mean tan slope m 0 152 with a correlation coefficient of r2 0 963 and the mean tan for 30 c steady state had a slope of m 0 349 with a correlation coefficient r2 0 986 a dlr from the plot of volumetric ammonia concentration against substrate concentration determined the performance τ of the biofilter fig 4 the τ values for each graph were summarized in table 2 differences in ammonia utilization rates for temperature regimes were determined using student t test analysis of the data tan oxidation rates were significantly p 0 05 higher at 30 c τ 159 7 day 1 than 20 c τ 58 81 day 1 rates this confirmed the numerical difference however the difference between 13 c τ 40 73 day 1 and 20 c τ 58 81 day 1 was not statistically significant this agrees with previous studies 5 which concluded numerical variations in the range of 14 27 c was not significantly different in substrate removal rates temperature impact on the substrate utilization within this range was in agreement with some suggestions from previous studies reviewed 38 4 3 42 however this can be explained as an effect of the lag in bacterial biomass growth phase during the short term temperature changes ammonia oxidation rates at 30 c were significantly different from those at 13 c and 20 c within the range of temperature values from previous studies 5 this is can be due to growth temperatures for nitrifying bacteria and it also indicates that in a dynamic system unlike mature biofilm bacteria yield is faster in warm temperatures 4 5 38 3 2 diurnal temperature 20 3 c and 30 3 c tan utilization rates total ammonia oxidation coefficient fig 5 at 20 3 c had a mean tan slope m 0 2856 corresponding to a correlation coefficient of r2 0 9796 substrate utilization rate at 30 3 c also had a mean tan slope m 0 4246 corresponding to a correlation coefficient of r2 0 9655 volumetric tan removal rates fig 6 in table 2 indicated that volumetric tan removal rates at 30 3 c τ 223 50 day 1 temperature regime were higher than 20 3 c τ 118 20 day 1 removal rate tan concentrations were significantly different p 0 05 for 20 3 c and 30 3 c temperature regimes this indicates that performance of the biofilter volumetric removal rate at 30 3 c was higher than removal rate at 20 3 c it was evident in the results that diurnal temperature volumetric removal rates were higher compared to the steady state temperatures this can be interpreted as an effect of temperature on biofilter oxidizing the ammonia in a seeded and acclimation stage it also indicates that temperature has an effect on the rate of ammonia oxidation by the bacteria or the growth rates during seeding and acclimation phase considering duration and substrate for bacteria to oxidize 43 results summary in table 2 figs 4 and 6 show τ values ranged between 40 224 day1 changes in concentration was used to determine ammonia oxidation rates which were significantly different for 20 c and 30 c steady state temperature regimes this may suggest an effect of temperature on bacterial reaction rates 44 31 however tan utilization was not significantly different between 13 c and 20 c regimes it also indicates that the bacterial density and growth rates could have an effect on the removal rates it should also be noted that optimum growth range for a certain microorganism occurs within a narrow range of temperature 31 however most microorganisms can grow within a wider range in previous studies 45 suggested that the relationship for bacterial growth increases with temperature up to or just below the maximum growth rate this may have had an effect on the ammonia oxidation rates considering the range in temperature from 13 c to 20 c and 20 c to 30 c the effect may explain why removal rates at 13 c and 20 c had numerical but no significant difference experiments were short term after a prior 3 day acclimation of the media it is therefore plausible to infer that bacterial biomass density on the media may have been in the lag phase at which the bacteria grow in size but not in counts a lag phase may be needed during acclimation of organisms to their new environment before and during significant biomass growth 46 31 tan utilizations at diurnal temperatures 20 3 c and 30 3 c were observed to be significantly higher than temperatures at 20 c and 30 c steady state average temperatures of diurnal regimes were higher than the steady state temperatures this may have positively influenced bacterial growth and acclimation response to temperature growth response to temperature increase may explain the increased efficiency of tan utilization rates at diurnal regimes direct linear regression method used for analyzing the efficiency of biofilter ammonia oxidation in this study was proposed in previous studies 38 6 31 this method was also used because of the low coefficient of variation in predictions when used as compared to a lineweaver burke linearization method 38 6 use of dlr method in this study was therefore suitable for determining the performance of seeded biofilters or biofilters in the lag phase this phase is attributed to stages where the bacteria are acclimating and growing in size but not reproducing it is speculated that the pseudo zero order reaction rates in a batch system may indicate that the biofilter was in the seeded stage with biomass growth in progress it also indicates that there was a high food to microorganism f m ratio the ratio may explain the linear trends seen in the data biofilter ammonia oxidation data presented did not include the heterotrophic bacteria effect in an organic carbon loaded system therefore the specific tan utilization rates and biofilter performance do not reflect predictions for carbon loaded system it is assumed that carbon loaded systems may have different bacterial growth kinetics 47 complexities of bacterial growth dynamics in a biofilm should not be understated simulation modeling studies and further laboratory and field studies may further clarify the bacteria kinetics of a biofilter in such systems 4 conclusions results of substrate utilization indicate that transient temperature has an effect on ammonia nitrogen oxidation in an acclimating biofilter substrate utilization also indicates that temperature changes impact ammonia oxidation in dynamic growth phase biofilter this effect can be attributed to the projected change in growth rate of ammonia oxidizing bacteria at transient temperature regimes this study concludes the following 1 tan removal rates at 13 c 20 c and 30 c temperature regimes indicate that seeded biofilter ammonium oxidation is impacted by transient temperature changes in a seeded and acclimation stage it therefore recommends improving tan oxdation potential of the biofilter in the growth phase by manipulating temperature change in the biofilter 2 tan oxidation rates at diurnal temperatures were higher than the corresponding steady state temperature regimes the implications of diurnal temperatures can enhance commercial systems needing to be acclimated in low temperature conditions where temperature fluctuations would affect acclimation duration of the biofilter 3 results suggest that dynamic biofilters subjected to transient temperatures especially in seeded and acclimation phase should be acclimated at higher temperatures the effect will influence ammonia oxidation and prepare the biofilter for quicker commissioning while reducing bacteria lag time for full operational efficiency 4 this study therefore suggests that temperature modifications such as water heating be considered in startup of seeded and acclimating biofilters prior to full scale use acknowledgements this work was partly supported by louisiana sea grant department of agricultural and biological engineering in the college of

the bacteria within the biofilm 34 36 these steps are encompassed into a single kinetic model monod models are used for fixed film nitrification kinetics in biofiltration process which summarize the complex transport and enzyme reactions 37 6 38 stages of enzyme kinetics and reactions are also determined by the michaelis menton expression the expression is used to represent fixed film

biofilters understanding the temperature ramifications on acclimation of biofilters and the reported findings will contribute to the potential development of best management practices for commercial water treatment with high substrate loading particularly in ras and other applications of water quality management the objectives were to determine 1 transient temperature impact on acclimating biofilter ammonia oxidation at different steady state temperatures 2 to determine biofilter ammonia oxidation at diurnal temperature regimes mimicking daily cyclical temperature patterns 2 materials and methods a direct linear regression dlr method proposed in prior studies 6 38 was used in this study in an assumption of zero order reaction kinetics the equation that fits the direct linear regression of the volumetric total ammonia nitrogen removal rate vtr in g m 3 day 1 is expressed as 4 vtr τ s c variables are defined as tau τ with unit d 1 is the slope of the line relating vtr and s concentration the y intercept c of the equation was normalized to zero slope of the direct linear regression eq 4 for tan oxidation rates at varying temperature regimes determined the biofilter performance for each specified temperature regime a batch system of tanks with custom designed intake airlift attached to biofilters fig 1 b for water flow and aeration of the biofilter was used for this study the airlifts were made out of polyvinyl chloride pvc 1 2 diameter 10 length tubes biofilters were made of acrylic tubes 2 diameter 7 5 height with base and a filter screen top inflow and outflow screens had a porosity of 6 106 μm2 media bed volume was 1 3 10 4 m3 a compressor central pneumatic s 34843 was used to supply air for airlift recirculation and aeration in the tanks water recirculation rate by the airlift through the biofilter was 0 7 liters per minute thirty six tanks 40 l capacity each were prepared in the laboratory nine of which were used to perform randomized replicate arrangement in the experiments three tanks 3 3 arrangement were assigned to each of the three temperature regimes specific nitrification polyethylene media enhanced nitrification en media aquaculture systems technologies llc new orleans la beads with a diameter of 3 mm fig 1a were used for the biofilters fig 1b in the tanks surface area of biofilm was assumed to include the media surface area and the inner walls of the bead contact area in the biofilter the volume was based on the dimensions of the biofilter specific surface area of the spherical polyethylene beads 2 3 mm typically used for the filtration bed was considered moderate at 1150 1475 m2 m 3 3 2 1 bead inoculation pre acclimation beads in the biofilters were inoculated before experimental sampling beads were placed in a single container at a fixed temperature for inoculation a tank was loaded with synthetic substrate nh4cl 5 mg liter and other trace nutrients nahco3 100 mg l k2hpo4 15 mg l cacl2 15 mg l mgso47h2o 100 mg l fecl36h2o 5 mg l with high purity 99 5 chemical concentration for bacteria growth and uniform loading at the start of experiments all chemicals were purchased from vwr international vwr com and the loading concentrations were adopted after wortman and wheaton 4 media was inoculated with seeded bacteria from an existing aquarium tank inoculation and start up lasted three weeks inoculation temperature was set at 25 c which is considered optimal for growth of nitrifying bacteria 19 the ph was also maintained at 7 0 8 6 33 36 oxygen concentration was maintained above 6 g m 3 in the aeration process for each tank it was considered to be above limiting concentration levels 5 39 2 2 biofilter acclimation the media was loaded in acrylic biofilter columns with attached pvc airlifts biofilters were acclimated at three steady state temperatures 13 c 20 c 30 c in the tanks automated temperature control maintained and collected data for duration test media acclimation at the three steady state temperatures lasted for 3 days 2 3 sanitization biofilter cylinders acrylic housing were sanitized between steady state and diurnal tests to minimize in situ nitrification proven to be problematic in similar studies 3 6 at the completion of each experimental temperature test beads were taken out of the cylinder and set aside in individual 20 l containers to maintain consistency of the biofilms during the sanitization stage sanitization took 2 h for all tanks to be complete the reactors were washed with diluted 1250 parts per million ppm bleach chlorine water with all the pieces taken apart scrubbed out and dropped into the tanks for bleach water circulation in the tank tanks were each loaded with 50 ml of concentrated bleach clorox per 40 l tank achieving a concentration of 1250 parts per million ppm of bleach per liter of water in each tank chilling pumps were activated to circulate diluted bleach within the tanks and through the heat exchangers which had the potential of bacteria growth on the inside the system was allowed to run for 2 h with the chlorine after which the tanks were drained using electric motor operated suction pumps biofilter cylinders were taken out of the drained tanks and further rinsed out with deionized distilled water before loading the beads into the cylinders deionized distilled water was used to rinse the biofilters cylinders out the tanks were flushed with water chlorine 0 2 ppm using automated pumps in the system this effectively eliminated residual bleach water in the heat exchangers the loaded cylinders with beads were repositioned in the tanks tanks were refilled with the synthetic substrate total time for cleaning was approximately 2½ hours 2 4 temperature control tanks were setup and controlled for desired temperatures using a customized temperature feedback control loop program system this was executed every 5 min while the program measured the temperature approximately every 3 s average readings of the data were computed and displayed on the computer monitor the computer adjusted the temperature as set for each batch of tanks 2 5 experimental design and sample analysis tanks were loaded with chemical feed stock 5 g m 3 at the start of the experiment tank temperature regime profiles were arranged in triplicates for each regime at 13 c 20 c and 30 c post acclimation for 72 h for the duration of the experiment the following experiments table 1 were performed regime profiles were recorded for temperatures 13 c 20 c 30 c with minimal temperature deviations 0 1 c changes in concentration for ammonia oxidized over 72 h 3 days were recorded and graphed for 13 c 20 c and 30 c steady state regimes concentrations from the data were graphed to determine tan removal rates per day for each of the three steady state temperature regimes in the second experiment the tanks were set to sinusoidal diurnal temperatures 20 3 c and 30 3 c fig 2 experiments lasted for 3 days samples s were collected at six hour intervals over the 72 h period with four samples per day as performed in previous studies by malone and pfeiffer 6 sample analysis determined the change in total ammonia concentration with time a spectrophotometer thermospectronic genesys 20 thermo electron corporation product krackeler scientific inc albany ny was used for sample analysis differences in ammonia decay between tanks for temperature regimes were determined using the t test for observed data all analyses were performed within 2 h of collecting the samples to reduce any reaction potential from suspended film bacteria samples were collected in disposable 50 ml centrifuge tubes and immediately analyzed substrate utilized was the difference between initial loading and final concentration after sampling reaction order for substrate utilization was assumed to be in a transition from zero order where the substrate is much more than the bacteria removal rate to first order and second order reaction kinetics as the bacterial biomass increased direct linear regression dlr lines were fitted to all data sets to determine the tau t values even though the biofilters were assumed to be in a dynamic phase the slopes for each temperature regime were interpreted from the data a statistical t test analysis compared substrate utilization rates between temperature regimes tan removal rates were normalized using intercepts forced to indicate initial removal rates in the dynamic bacterial growth process only for computational purposes value of findings were calculated from the sum of square errors sse to determine the value of differences in result analysis minimum substrate concentration required to sustain a steady state biofilm was maintained for the experiment 38 40 41 ammonia oxidation data were expressed in a direct linear relation for each temperature regime 13 c 20 c 30 c 20 3 c and 30 3 c 3 results results put forward relevant information that was not previously considered in a dynamic seeded acclimating biofiltration process the growing need for commercial application of biofilters in water treatment and recirculating systems particularly may further benefit from continued research in this area however results from this study give insight to seeded acclimating biofilter ammonia oxidation for short term temperature variations at steady state and sinusoidal temperature perturbations the following discussion outlines data analyses at different temperature regimes 3 1 steady state temperature tan utilization rates total ammonia oxidation fig 3 coefficient at 13 c steady state had a mean tan slope m 0 107 with a correlation coefficient of r2 0 930 the substrate utilization rate at 20 c steady state also had a mean tan slope m 0 152 with a correlation coefficient of r2 0 963 and the mean tan for 30 c steady state had a slope of m 0 349 with a correlation coefficient r2 0 986 a dlr from the plot of volumetric ammonia concentration against substrate concentration determined the performance τ of the biofilter fig 4 the τ values for each graph were summarized in table 2 differences in ammonia utilization rates for temperature regimes were determined using student t test analysis of the data tan oxidation rates were significantly p 0 05 higher at 30 c τ 159 7 day 1 than 20 c τ 58 81 day 1 rates this confirmed the numerical difference however the difference between 13 c τ 40 73 day 1 and 20 c τ 58 81 day 1 was not statistically significant this agrees with previous studies 5 which concluded numerical variations in the range of 14 27 c was not significantly different in substrate removal rates temperature impact on the substrate utilization within this range was in agreement with some suggestions from previous studies reviewed 38 4 3 42 however this can be explained as an effect of the lag in bacterial biomass growth phase during the short term temperature changes ammonia oxidation rates at 30 c were significantly different from those at 13 c and 20 c within the range of temperature values from previous studies 5 this is can be due to growth temperatures for nitrifying bacteria and it also indicates that in a dynamic system unlike mature biofilm bacteria yield is faster in warm temperatures 4 5 38 3 2 diurnal temperature 20 3 c and 30 3 c tan utilization rates total ammonia oxidation coefficient fig 5 at 20 3 c had a mean tan slope m 0 2856 corresponding to a correlation coefficient of r2 0 9796 substrate utilization rate at 30 3 c also had a mean tan slope m 0 4246 corresponding to a correlation coefficient of r2 0 9655 volumetric tan removal rates fig 6 in table 2 indicated that volumetric tan removal rates at 30 3 c τ 223 50 day 1 temperature regime were higher than 20 3 c τ 118 20 day 1 removal rate tan concentrations were significantly different p 0 05 for 20 3 c and 30 3 c temperature regimes this indicates that performance of the biofilter volumetric removal rate at 30 3 c was higher than removal rate at 20 3 c it was evident in the results that diurnal temperature volumetric removal rates were higher compared to the steady state temperatures this can be interpreted as an effect of temperature on biofilter oxidizing the ammonia in a seeded and acclimation stage it also indicates that temperature has an effect on the rate of ammonia oxidation by the bacteria or the growth rates during seeding and acclimation phase considering duration and substrate for bacteria to oxidize 43 results summary in table 2 figs 4 and 6 show τ values ranged between 40 224 day1 changes in concentration was used to determine ammonia oxidation rates which were significantly different for 20 c and 30 c steady state temperature regimes this may suggest an effect of temperature on bacterial reaction rates 44 31 however tan utilization was not significantly different between 13 c and 20 c regimes it also indicates that the bacterial density and growth rates could have an effect on the removal rates it should also be noted that optimum growth range for a certain microorganism occurs within a narrow range of temperature 31 however most microorganisms can grow within a wider range in previous studies 45 suggested that the relationship for bacterial growth increases with temperature up to or just below the maximum growth rate this may have had an effect on the ammonia oxidation rates considering the range in temperature from 13 c to 20 c and 20 c to 30 c the effect may explain why removal rates at 13 c and 20 c had numerical but no significant difference experiments were short term after a prior 3 day acclimation of the media it is therefore plausible to infer that bacterial biomass density on the media may have been in the lag phase at which the bacteria grow in size but not in counts a lag phase may be needed during acclimation of organisms to their new environment before and during significant biomass growth 46 31 tan utilizations at diurnal temperatures 20 3 c and 30 3 c were observed to be significantly higher than temperatures at 20 c and 30 c steady state average temperatures of diurnal regimes were higher than the steady state temperatures this may have positively influenced bacterial growth and acclimation response to temperature growth response to temperature increase may explain the increased efficiency of tan utilization rates at diurnal regimes direct linear regression method used for analyzing the efficiency of biofilter ammonia oxidation in this study was proposed in previous studies 38 6 31 this method was also used because of the low coefficient of variation in predictions when used as compared to a lineweaver burke linearization method 38 6 use of dlr method in this study was therefore suitable for determining the performance of seeded biofilters or biofilters in the lag phase this phase is attributed to stages where the bacteria are acclimating and growing in size but not reproducing it is speculated that the pseudo zero order reaction rates in a batch system may indicate that the biofilter was in the seeded stage with biomass growth in progress it also indicates that there was a high food to microorganism f m ratio the ratio may explain the linear trends seen in the data biofilter ammonia oxidation data presented did not include the heterotrophic bacteria effect in an organic carbon loaded system therefore the specific tan utilization rates and biofilter performance do not reflect predictions for carbon loaded system it is assumed that carbon loaded systems may have different bacterial growth kinetics 47 complexities of bacterial growth dynamics in a biofilm should not be understated simulation modeling studies and further laboratory and field studies may further clarify the bacteria kinetics of a biofilter in such systems 4 conclusions results of substrate utilization indicate that transient temperature has an effect on ammonia nitrogen oxidation in an acclimating biofilter substrate utilization also indicates that temperature changes impact ammonia oxidation in dynamic growth phase biofilter this effect can be attributed to the projected change in growth rate of ammonia oxidizing bacteria at transient temperature regimes this study concludes the following 1 tan removal rates at 13 c 20 c and 30 c temperature regimes indicate that seeded biofilter ammonium oxidation is impacted by transient temperature changes in a seeded and acclimation stage it therefore recommends improving tan oxdation potential of the biofilter in the growth phase by manipulating temperature change in the biofilter 2 tan oxidation rates at diurnal temperatures were higher than the corresponding steady state temperature regimes the implications of diurnal temperatures can enhance commercial systems needing to be acclimated in low temperature conditions where temperature fluctuations would affect acclimation duration of the biofilter 3 results suggest that dynamic biofilters subjected to transient temperatures especially in seeded and acclimation phase should be acclimated at higher temperatures the effect will influence ammonia oxidation and prepare the biofilter for quicker commissioning while reducing bacteria lag time for full operational efficiency 4 this study therefore suggests that temperature modifications such as water heating be considered in startup of seeded and acclimating biofilters prior to full scale use acknowledgements this work was partly supported by louisiana sea grant department of agricultural and biological engineering in the college of

14509,in this work walnut shell ws carya illinoinensis treated with citric acid was used as biosorbent to remove zinc ions from aqueous solution the effect of citric acid concentration and solution ph on the adsorption equilibrium was investigated in batch experiments additionally the overall adsorption rate of zn ions on walnut shell treated with citric acid was investigated by applying a diffusion model based on superficial diffusion the results evidenced that a maximum adsorption capacity towards zn ii ions is obtained by using a citric acid concentration 2 m ws2 the modification of walnut shell increases 2 5 times its adsorption capacity to remove zn ii from aqueous solutions due to the incorporation of carboxylic groups reaching a maximum adsorption capacity of 27 86 mg g the ph effect showed that the adsorption capacity was drastically increased by raising the solution ph from 3 to 6 the adsorption kinetics of zn ii on ws2 were interpreted correctly by the surface

metals is of great concern due to potential health hazard caused by these compounds to the environment 1 due to their water solubility and bioaccumulative tendency in different matrices of the environment some heavy metals are extremely toxic even at low exposure levels 2 zinc is released into the aquatic environment through several industrial activities such as mining metal coating battery production and its use in paints ceramics wood fabrics drugs sun blocks and deodorants 3 5 zinc is associated with short term metal fume fever nausea diarrhea depression lethargy and neurological signs such as seizures and ataxia 6 some of the most common treatment methods to remove zinc from industrial wastewaters are chemical precipitation reverse osmosis ion exchange evaporation filtration oxidation reduction process and adsorption biosorption 7 as an environmental technology biosorption plays a main role in reducing the amount of heavy metals pollution in aqueous phase moreover the list of the advantages of biosorption includes competitive performance heavy metal selectivity cost effectiveness regeneration and no sludge generation from an economic point of view some natural biosorbents have been used as low cost sorbent alternatives for removing heavy metals including saw dust wheat husk maize corn cob sugarcane bagasse orange peels groundnut shells coconut shells and walnut shells 8 walnut shell is an abundant agricultural residue with good chemical stability and high mechanical strength and it has been successfully used in the removal of heavy metals in wastewater such as cr vi cd ii and pb ii 9 10 the adsorption equilibrium of heavy metals on natural or modified walnut shell has been extensively investigated in the literature and its adsorption mechanism has been elucidated ding et al 11 investigated the removal of cesium cs from aqueous solutions using walnut shell modified with nickel hexacyanoferrate nihcf ws serving as trap agent for cs results revealed that the cs adsorption by nihcf ws is a multilayer chemical adsorption and the main adsorption mechanism was ion exchange the cs adsorbed mass was 4 9 mg g at 25 c untreated pecan nutshell carya illinoinensis was used by vaghetti et al 12 to study the removal of cu ii mn ii and pb ii from aqueous solutions in this study the ph value was fixed at 5 5 for all the metallic ions and 25 c the results showed that the adsorption mechanism of all metallic ions is due to the interaction between carboxylic and phenolic groups of the adsorbent saadat and karimi jashni 13 performed a full 24 factorial design to analyze the effect of various operating conditions such as ph adsorbent dose initial metal concentration and temperature and their interactions on the adsorption of pb ii ions by walnut shell modified by naoh the results showed that the adsorbent dosage has the most significant impact on the pb ii removal efficiency while the effect of temperature on the adsorption process was not significant the maximum mass adsorbed of pb ii was 3 29 mg g at ph 6 3 the above results reveal that the adsorption capacity of walnut shell modified with chemical agents to remove heavy metals is still low so it is necessary to formulate new strategies to increase its adsorption capacity to design correctly packed adsorption columns it is necessary to evaluate the adsorption equilibrium and the adsorption mechanism but it is also crucial to obtain the adsorption rate and identify the mass transfer mechanism that controls the overall adsorption rate in the literature empirical models as pseudo first order and pseudo second order are generally the most common kinetics models used for describing adsorption kinetics of several metal ions onto various biosorbents 14 18 however the application of these models does not provide information about the influence of operational variables on mass transfer resistances thus one the main aim of this work is to investigate the adsorption capacity of walnut shell treated with citric acid to remove zn ii from aqueous solution the effects of citric acid concentration used on the treatment and the solution ph will be also analyzed and the second aim is to study the mass transfer mechanism that controls the overall adsorption rate of zn ii by employing diffusional models that incorporate external mass transfer intraparticle diffusion and adsorption on active site moreover the effects of agitation speed and mass adsorbed of zn ii on the diffusional coefficients will be elucidated 2 experimental methodology 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used in this work were at least reagent grade and or of the highest purity available commercially stock metal solution was prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of znno3 in deionized water the concentration of zn ii in aqueous solution was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry using a varian spectrometer spectra aa 20 2 2 walnut pecan shell carya illinoinensis the walnut pecan shell ws originated in venado san luis potosí méxico it was washed several times with distilled water to remove dust and impurities then it was dried out in an oven at 75 c for 24 h after that it was ground and sieved to obtain particle diameters of 0 45 mm and finally stored in a plastic container until its use 2 3 modification of walnut pecan shell the ws was chemically modified with aqueous solutions of 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 m of citric acid ca using the following procedure 20 g of ws were immersed in 200 ml of ca solution and continuously stirred for 2 h at a temperature of 60 c subsequently the suspension was cooled down for about 3 h the acid solution was decanted and the solid was placed in a muffle at 80 c for 24 h after that the temperature was increased to 110 c for 3 h then the modified ws mws was washed several times with deionized water to remove the excess ca the mws was dried at 80 c for 24 h and stored in a plastic container in general a carboxylic group from the three carboxylic groups that are contained in the ca molecule reacts with the oh groups of the ws main constituents through an esterification reaction so the other two free carboxylic groups are available to bind metal ions additional details of this methodology can be found elsewhere 19 20 the treated ws samples were labeled as ws0 5 ws1 ws1 5 and ws2 depending on the concentration of citric acid used 2 4 characterization of natural and modified walnut pecan shell 2 4 1 textural characterization the textural properties of ws and ws2 surface area sbet pore volume vp and average pore diameter dp were determined by the adsorption of n2 at 77 k using a surface area and porosimetry analyzer micromeritics asap 2020 the brunauer emmett and teller bet method and bjh method were applied to calculate the surface area and the pore size distribution respectively the solid density ρs was calculated by the helium displacement method using a helium pycnometer thus the particle density ρp and the void fraction εp were estimated using the following equations 1 ρ p ρ s 1 v p ρ s 2 ε p v p v p 1 ρ s 2 4 2 chemical characterization the ph of point of zero charge phpzc of biosorbents was determined by the titration acid base procedure proposed by kuzin and loskutov 21 the determination of phpzc was performed as follows 50 ml of 0 1 mol l nacl were added to 50 ml volumetric flasks the ph of the solutions in each flask was adjusted to 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 by adding appropriate amounts of 0 1 mol l naoh or hcl solutions afterwards 0 1 g of biosorbent was added to a plastic container with 25 ml of each solution at different ph the remaining 25 ml in each flask were poured into a plastic container and denoted as blanks nitrogen was bubbled for 2 min on the solutions to prevent carbonates formation after 5 days the final ph of all solutions including the blanks was measured and graphed versus the volume added of naoh or hcl the intersection of both curves corresponded to the phpzc of the biosorbent the concentration of the active sites of materials was determined by the acid base titration method proposed by boehm 22 the total acidic and basic sites were neutralized with 0 01 m naoh and hcl solutions respectively the total acidic sites included the carboxylic phenolic and lactonic sites additionally the carboxylic sites were neutralized with a 0 01 m nahco3 solution and the carboxylic and lactonic sites with a 0 01 m na2co3 solution lastly the phenolic sites were estimated by subtracting the carboxylic and lactonic sites from the total acidic sites the titration procedure can be described as follows 0 1 g of biosorbent was placed into a plastic tube with 45 ml of neutralized solution the plastic tubes were immersed for seven days into a water bath at 25 c after equilibrium was reached a 20 ml aliquot was taken to be titrated with a naoh or hcl solution the morphology of the biosorbents was visualized using a scanning electron microscope jeol jsm 6330 f lastly the functional groups present in both adsorbents were identified with a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrophotometer thermo scientific nicolet is10 and using the technique of attenuated total reflectance atr 2 5 equilibrium adsorption experiments the adsorption capacity qe of ws and all treated ws towards zn ii was obtained from adsorption experiments carried out in a batch adsorber the adsorption equilibrium was analyzed with the following procedure a mass of 0 1 g of ws or treated ws and 40 ml of a solution with an initial concentration of zn ii ranging from 10 to 300 mg l were contacted in a batch adsorber plastic tube of 50 ml the adsorber was partially immersed in a thermostatic water bath and the solution was mixed twice a day for 15 min by placing the adsorber on top of an orbital shaker in preliminary experiments 7 days proved to be enough to attain equilibrium and during this period the ph of the adsorber solution was kept constant by adding a few drops of 0 01 m hno3 or naoh solutions after equilibrium was reached an aliquot of 5 ml was taken to determine the final concentration the mass adsorbed of zn ii per gram of adsorbent was calculated using the following equation 3 q v c a0 c ae m the adsorption equilibrium data were fitted by freundlich langmuir and prausnitz radkee adsorption isotherms models these models are mathematically represented by the following equations 4 q k c ae 1 n 5 q q m k c ae 1 k c ae 6 q a c ae 1 b c ae β the adsorption isotherms parameters were estimated by fitting the isotherm models to the experimental data using an optimization method which was based on the rosenbrock newton algorithm to select the better fit among the three isotherm models the average absolute percentage deviation d of each isotherm was also calculated the d is mathematically represented by the following equation 7 d 1 n i 1 n q exp q cal q exp 100 2 6 adsorption kinetic experiments the adsorption kinetics of zn ii onto the most effective treated ws were obtained in a rotating basket adsorber the mechanical characteristics and design of this adsorber have been given elsewhere 23 the adsorber was partially immersed in a constant temperature water bath a mass of 1 2 or 3 g of adsorbent was placed in the baskets and put in contact with 995 ml of a known concentration solution of zn ii from 60 to 600 mg l at ph 6 optimal ph this ph was obtained by mixing proper volumes of 0 01 mol l hno3 or naoh solutions the stirring speeds varied from 150 to 250 rpm an aliquot of 1 ml was periodically taken at different times and analyzed to determine the zn ii concentration then the dimensionless zn ii concentration was calculated with the following equation 8 φa ca ca0 the dimensionless zn ii concentration was plotted versus time to obtain the adsorption kinetic 3 results and discussion 3 1 textural and chemical characteristics of adsorbents fig 1 exhibits the ftir spectrums of ws ws0 5 ws1 0 ws1 5 ws2 and ws2 loaded with zn ii the spectrum corresponding to ws indicates the presence of different functional groups at wavelengths of 3317 cm 1 it displays a strong and broad oh stretching band the oh groups are attributed to the ch stretching band for the sp3 carbon atoms occurred at 2890 cm 1 ch are present in cellulose hemicellulose and lignin at 1710 cm 1 a co valence vibration of carboxylic groups appeared and a c o stretching band shows at 1200 and 1020 cm 1 wavelengths c o are characteristic in alcohols esters and carboxylics present in cellulose hemicellulose and lignin as observed in fig 1 upon modification the intensity of the co stretching band at 1710 cm 1 increased remarkably as the ca concentration augment revealing that an gradual amount of carboxylic groups was fixed during modification furthermore the decrease of the strong and broad oh stretching band at 3315 cm 1 reflects the esterification of the citric acid 24 fig 1 also exhibited the ftir spectrum of ws2 loaded with zn ii the most significant shifts were observed at 3317 cm 1 oh stretching band 1710 cm 1 co valence vibration of carboxylic groups and 1020 cm 1 c o stretching band the shifts of these bands may indicate the possibility of ws2 interacting with zn ii via these functional groups as an example the sem micrographs of ws and ws2 are shown in fig 2 it can be observed that the surfaces of ws and ws2 have a complex and multilayer structure any samples show the presence of certain cracks after modification there is no significant difference in the surface structure between ws and ws2 which indicates that the acid treatment at this concentration did not affect the main constituents of ws table 1 shows the values of the surface area for ws and all treated samples the values of the surface areas were in the range of 0 11 0 37 m2 g clearly it can be noticed that these materials are nonporous which was also observed with the sem images previously srinivasan and viraraghavan 25 altun and pehlivan 24 and teixeira et al 26 reported values of surface area for ws of 0 17 2 79 and 13 1 m2 g respectively altun and pehlivan 24 also reported for ws treated with citric acid surface area of 4 32 m2 g and teixeira et al 26 reported values of 12 6 and 9 1 m2 g for ws treated with hcl and naoh respectively the values of phpzc and the concentrations of active sites for ws and ws2 which were taken as reference biosorbents are exhibited in table 2 as observed the phpzc for ws and ws2 are 4 5 and 3 3 respectively thus both materials have most likely acidic surfaces the increase of acid sites content on the surface of ws2 due to the treatment it causes a decrease of phpzc moreover the total acidic sites concentrations of ws increased up to 2 3 times upon modification with ca 3 2 effect of the operational variables on the adsorption equilibrium the adsorption isotherms of zn ii on ws and all treated ws samples are displayed in fig 3 overall the adsorption capacity of zn ii was dependent of citric acid concentration the adsorption capacity of zn ii was gradually augmented by increasing the ca concentration in the following order 2 0 1 5 1 0 m 0 5 m in fig 3 it can be observed that the adsorption capacity of ws2 at equilibrium concentration of zn ii of 80 mg l was 2 4 times greater than that of ws the adsorption capacity of zn ii increased due to the actives sites that were incorporated on the material surface upon modification the carboxylic sites deprotonate in a ph range of 3 6 thus at the ph of work ph 7 the carboxylic sites are completely available to bind with the metal ions consequently increasing the adsorption capacity this aspect was corroborated by salazar rabago and leyva ramos 20 who modified natural sawdust through a hydrothermal procedure using citric malonic and tartaric acids to remove pb ii from aqueous solutions and observed that the adsorption capacity was almost linearly dependent on the concentration of carboxylic sites on the surface adsorbents table 2 shows the adsorption isotherm parameters obtained during the adsorption of zn ii on all adsorbents in this table is evident that prausnitz radke model provided the best fit since the average absolute percentage deviation d was the lowest this result was expected since prausnitz radke isotherm is a three parameter model while freundlich and langmuir isotherms are two parameters models it is well known that ph is an important parameter impacting on the adsorption process the solution ph significantly affects the ionization degree the metal chemistry and the material s surface properties the effect of solution ph on the adsorption isotherms is attributed to interactions between ions in solution and the adsorbent surface by determining the adsorption isotherms at ph of 3 5 6 and 7 the effect of the ph solution was studied on ws2 sample table 3 exhibits the adsorption isotherm parameters where it is evident that the prausnitz radke model interpreted in a better way the experimental data at different solution ph on the other hand fig 4 shows that the zn ii adsorption was significantly affected by the solution ph the adsorption capacity of ws2 was increased by 9 4 11 8 and 11 5 fold by augmenting the ph from 3 to 5 3 to 6 and 3 to 7 correspondingly the maximum zn ii adsorption occurred at ph 6 meanwhile at ph 7 the adsorption capacity of zn ii decreased slightly the speciation diagram for zn ii have been reported by several authors at ph 6 the zn2 form dominates while at ph 7 zn ii starts to precipitate as zn oh and zn oh 2 the point of zero charge ph phpzc is the ph of the solution at which the overall observed charge on the surface of the material is zero as it can be observed on table 1 the phpzc of ws2 was 3 3 the surface of ws2 was positively charged at ph 3 3 and negatively charged at ph 3 3 thus the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged surface and the zn ii ions in the solution favored the adsorption of zn ii on ws2 because the magnitude of the negative charge of surface augmented by raising the ph solution deprotonation of functional groups such as carboxylic groups occurs at increasing ph and these behave as negatively charged moieties attracting heavy metals 27 this could explained why at ph 7 the zn ii adsorption capacity decreased at ph 7 zn ii started to precipitate as zn oh and zn oh 2 resulting in reduced attraction between the zn ii ions and the ws2 similar results were reported by taha et al 27 some researchers have studied the adsorption of zn ii on several biosorbents all agreed that the optimum ph where the maximum mass of zn ii adsorbed was in the range of 5 and 6 8 table 4 exhibits that the maximum adsorption capacity qm of zn ii on ws2 was 28 58 mg g which is higher than that reported for bentonite and modified sawdust with formaldehyde and sodium hydroxide but slightly lower than carrot residue these results show that ws2 has a potential for removing zn ii ions from aqueous solutions 3 3 interpretation of overall adsorption rate in this work a diffusional model was used to interpret the adsorption rate of zn ii on ws2 this model was derived by assuming the following i intraparticle diffusion occurs by pore volume diffusion fick diffusion and surface diffusion ii the rate of adsorption on an active site is instantaneous and iii adsorbent particles are spherical model equations and initial and boundary conditions are 31 32 9 v d c a dt ms k l c a c ar r r p 10 t 0 c a c a0 11 ε p c ar t ρ p q t 1 r 2 r r 2 d ep c ar r d s ρ p q r 12 c ar 0 t 0 0 r r p 13 c ar r r 0 0 14 d ep c ar r r r d s ρ p q r k l c a c ar r r p if the rate of adsorption on an active site is instantaneous there is local equilibrium between the adsorbate concentration in the solution inside the pore and the mass of zn ii adsorbed on the pore surface this equilibrium is normally represented by the adsorption isotherm which is the mathematical relationship between car and q 31 32 15 q f c ar the model represented by eqs 9 to 14 is the general diffusional model pvsdm parameters kl ds and dep correspond to external transport surface diffusion and pore volume diffusion mechanisms respectively 31 32 fig 5 exhibits the adsorption kinetic data of zn ii onto ws2 run 5 in this figure it can be noticed that the adsorption equilibrium is reached at 1200 min therefore to ensure all the experiments attained equilibrium they were carried out for 1700 min it was noted that the solution ph decreased during the adsorption of zn ii thus it was maintained constant ph 6 optimal ph by adding a few drops of 0 1 or 0 01 mol l naoh solutions the total added volume of these solutions was less than 2 ml the adsorption kinetic curves were obtained at various operating conditions such as agitation speed biosorbent mass and initial metal concentration all experimental conditions are listed in table 5 table 1 shows that the pore volume and porosity of ws2 are extremely small therefore it was assumed that the zn ii ions would not be able to diffuse throughout the pore volume dep 0 hence the contribution of the pore volume diffusion to the total intraparticle diffusion can be eliminated for this type of nonporous adsorbent therefore it was implicit that the overall adsorption rate of zn ii on ws2 can be well represented by the surface difusional model sdm to apply the sdm model the values of the external mass transfer coefficient kl and the surface diffusion coefficients ds are required experimental values of kl were estimated by the procedure proposed by furusawa and smith 33 which is based on the fact that when t 0 then car 0 and ca ca0 substituting these conditions in eq 9 16 can be obtained while the ds values were obtained by matching the numerical solution of the model to the experimental data the optimal value of ds was the value that best fitted the experimental data by minimizing the objective function given by eq 17 16 d c a c a0 dt t 0 ms k l v 17 1 n ϕ exp ϕ pred 2 minimum as a representative example fig 5 exhibits the experimental data of run 5 which was predicted by the sdm model as it can be seen the sdm model satisfactory predicts the experimental data the optimal value of ds was 3 10 10 9 cm2 s only a few researchers have reported adsorption rates of heavy metals onto biosorbents applying diffusional models garcía reyes and rangel mendez applied the sdm model to the adsorption rate of cr iii onto sorghum straw oats straw and agave bagasse 34 the values of ds obtained were 7 10 5 4 10 5 and 8 10 6 cm2 s respectively additionally they found that the ds values remained constant when increasing the initial metal concentration from 20 to 50 mg l and when increasing the agitation speed from 200 to 400 rpm it is important to remark that the values found in this work are almost four order of magnitude smaller than those reported by garcía reyes and rangel mendez 34 however taking into account that the molecular coefficient of cr iii in aqueous solutions at infinite dilution is 5 10 6 cm2 s 35 the ds values reported in the literature evidently lack physical meaning because these values indicate that cr iii molecules diffused much faster within the adsorbent pore volume than in the aqueous solution outside the pores in the literature ds values of the same magnitude order than those found in this work have been found but in different adsorbate adsorbent systems baskaralingam et al 36 performed adsorption and kinetic studies of orange reactive dye onto modified hectorites the ds value reported was 4 82 10 9 cm2 s ocampo pérez et al 37 studied the equilibrium and kinetic adsorption of organic compounds onto organobentonite applying the surface diffusion model sdm model the optimal ds values were 1 68 10 9 and 2 41 10 9 cm2 s for methylene blue and methyl blue respectively the effect of the mass of zn ii adsorbed at equilibrium qe on ds was studied by varying the initial concentration of zn ii and keeping constant the mass of ws2 or maintaining constant the initial concentration of zn ii and varying the mass of ws2 as an example fig 6 shows the experimental adsorption kinetics for runs 5 7 8 and 10 and their corresponding values of qe this figure depicts that the sdm model fitted the experimental data reasonably well and that the ds values augment by increasing qe this behavior was also obtained for runs 11 5 and 12 using masses of ws2 of 1 2 and 3 g respectively in general for all experimental conditions the sdm model interpreted very well the experimental data and the values of ds increased from 2 25 10 9 to 5 25 10 9 as the qe values augmented from 22 7 to 32 mg g respectively the surface diffusion is the movement of the adsorbate molecules along the pore surface of the adsorbent and its driving force is the surface concentration gradient q 32 hence the influence of qe on ds was attributed to that at the beginning the zn ii molecules were adsorbed on the higher adsorption energy sites therefore few of the adsorbed molecules had enough energy to move along the surface from one site to another once the sites with higher energy were occupied the zn ii molecules would be adsorbed on the low energy adsorption sites as a result the zn ii molecules in these sites would have greater ds values the ds dependency with respect to qe was interpreted by the equation proposed by sudo et al 38 represented as follows 18 d s d s0 e α q e using a nonlinear optimization method the values of ds0 and α were estimated and were ds0 9 02 10 8 cm2 s and α 0 052 g mg fig 7 shows the values of ds and the prediction of the eq 18 where it can be observed that it fits moderately well with the experimental data the value of ds0 indicates the highest value of ds obtained when qe 0 the mass transfer in a rotating basket adsorber depends on the agitation speed particle size and the adsorber geometry the effect of external mass transfer on the overall adsorption rate was studied by carrying out experiments at different agitation speeds but maintaining the same operational conditions run 1 3 fig 8 exhibited the graphs of zn ii concentration throughout the time from the experimental data obtained at agitation speeds of 150 200 and 250 rpm in this figure it can be shown that the sdm model predicts quite well the experimental data and the adsorption kinetics of 200 and 250 rpm are below the graph of 150 rpm additionally it was noticed that the experimental data at 200 and 250 rpm overlapped each other thus the external mass transfer resistance was not important at velocities greater than 200 rpm likewise fig 8 shows that kl values increased as the agitation speed increased from 150 to 250 rpm on the other hand the ds values augmented considerably as the agitation speed increased from 150 to 200 rpm but did not change much when increasing the agitation speed from 200 to 250 rpm therefore the ds value was not affected when augmenting the agitation speed to 250 rpm an additional way to analyze the importance of the external mass transfer was used to interpret the experimental data with the best value of ds and varying the kl value for example fig 9 shows the experimental data and the prediction of the sdm model for run 10 using the best value of ds 5 25 10 9 cm2 s and its corresponding value of kl 2 50 10 6 cm s besides this figure includes the prediction of the sdm model using values of kl of 1 50 10 6 and 8 20 10 6 cm s these values correspond to the minimal and maximum values of kl reported in table 3 for 250 rpm fig 9 shows that the three predictions of the sdm model remain practically constant indicating that at a 250 rpm agitation speed the overall rate adsorption of zn ii onto ws2 is not affected by the external mass transfer 4 conclusions the adsorption capacity of ws modified with citric acid increases 2 5 times its adsorption capacity to remove zn ii from aqueous solutions due to the incorporation of carboxylic groups the overall adsorption rate of zn ii on ws2 is controlled by intraparticle diffusion because the effects of the external mass transport are minimized when the experiments are carried out at stirring rates greater than 200 rpm the adsorption kinetics of zn ii on ws2 were interpreted correctly by the sdm model which assumes that zn ii ions will not be able to diffuse throughout the pore volume due to its null porosity the values of ds varied from 2 25 to 5 25 10 9 cm2 s and increased exponentially as the mass of zn ii adsorbed at equilibrium augmented acknowledgments this work was funded by consejo nacional de ciencia y tecnología national council of science and

14509,in this work walnut shell ws carya illinoinensis treated with citric acid was used as biosorbent to remove zinc ions from aqueous solution the effect of citric acid concentration and solution ph on the adsorption equilibrium was investigated in batch experiments additionally the overall adsorption rate of zn ions on walnut shell treated with citric acid was investigated by applying a diffusion model based on superficial diffusion the results evidenced that a maximum adsorption capacity towards zn ii ions is obtained by using a citric acid concentration 2 m ws2 the modification of

metals is of great concern due to potential health hazard caused by these compounds to the environment 1 due to their water solubility and bioaccumulative tendency in different matrices of the environment some heavy metals are extremely toxic even at low exposure levels 2 zinc is released into the aquatic environment through several industrial activities such as mining metal coating battery production and its use in paints ceramics wood fabrics drugs sun blocks and deodorants 3 5 zinc is associated with short term metal fume fever nausea diarrhea depression lethargy and neurological signs such as seizures and ataxia 6 some of the most common treatment methods to remove zinc from industrial wastewaters are chemical precipitation reverse osmosis ion exchange evaporation filtration oxidation reduction process and adsorption biosorption 7 as an environmental technology biosorption plays a main role in reducing the amount of heavy metals pollution in aqueous phase moreover the list of the advantages of biosorption includes competitive performance heavy metal selectivity cost effectiveness regeneration and no sludge generation from an economic point of view some natural biosorbents have been used as low cost sorbent alternatives for removing heavy metals including saw dust wheat husk maize corn cob sugarcane bagasse orange peels groundnut shells coconut shells and walnut shells 8 walnut shell is an abundant agricultural residue with good chemical stability and high mechanical strength and it has been successfully used in the removal of heavy metals in wastewater such as cr vi cd ii and pb ii 9 10 the adsorption equilibrium of heavy metals on natural or modified walnut shell has been extensively investigated in the literature and its adsorption mechanism has been elucidated ding et al 11 investigated the removal of cesium cs from aqueous solutions using walnut shell modified with nickel hexacyanoferrate nihcf ws serving as trap agent for cs results revealed that the cs adsorption by nihcf ws is a multilayer chemical adsorption and the main adsorption mechanism was ion exchange the cs adsorbed mass was 4 9 mg g at 25 c untreated pecan nutshell carya illinoinensis was used by vaghetti et al 12 to study the removal of cu ii mn ii and pb ii from aqueous solutions in this study the ph value was fixed at 5 5 for all the metallic ions and 25 c the results showed that the adsorption mechanism of all metallic ions is due to the interaction between carboxylic and phenolic groups of the adsorbent saadat and karimi jashni 13 performed a full 24 factorial design to analyze the effect of various operating conditions such as ph adsorbent dose initial metal concentration and temperature and their interactions on the adsorption of pb ii ions by walnut shell modified by naoh the results showed that the adsorbent dosage has the most significant impact on the pb ii removal efficiency while the effect of temperature on the adsorption process was not significant the maximum mass adsorbed of pb ii was 3 29 mg g at ph 6 3 the above results reveal that the adsorption capacity of walnut shell modified with chemical agents to remove heavy metals is still low so it is necessary to formulate new strategies to increase its adsorption capacity to design correctly packed adsorption columns it is necessary to evaluate the adsorption equilibrium and the adsorption mechanism but it is also crucial to obtain the adsorption rate and identify the mass transfer mechanism that controls the overall adsorption rate in the literature empirical models as pseudo first order and pseudo second order are generally the most common kinetics models used for describing adsorption kinetics of several metal ions onto various biosorbents 14 18 however the application of these models does not provide information about the influence of operational variables on mass transfer resistances thus one the main aim of this work is to investigate the adsorption capacity of walnut shell treated with citric acid to remove zn ii from aqueous solution the effects of citric acid concentration used on the treatment and the solution ph will be also analyzed and the second aim is to study the mass transfer mechanism that controls the overall adsorption rate of zn ii by employing diffusional models that incorporate external mass transfer intraparticle diffusion and adsorption on active site moreover the effects of agitation speed and mass adsorbed of zn ii on the diffusional coefficients will be elucidated 2 experimental methodology 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used in this work were at least reagent grade and or of the highest purity available commercially stock metal solution was prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of znno3 in deionized water the concentration of zn ii in aqueous solution was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry using a varian spectrometer spectra aa 20 2 2 walnut pecan shell carya illinoinensis the walnut pecan shell ws originated in venado san luis potosí méxico it was washed several times with distilled water to remove dust and impurities then it was dried out in an oven at 75 c for 24 h after that it was ground and sieved to obtain particle diameters of 0 45 mm and finally stored in a plastic container until its use 2 3 modification of walnut pecan shell the ws was chemically modified with aqueous solutions of 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 m of citric acid ca using the following procedure 20 g of ws were immersed in 200 ml of ca solution and continuously stirred for 2 h at a temperature of 60 c subsequently the suspension was cooled down for about 3 h the acid solution was decanted and the solid was placed in a muffle at 80 c for 24 h after that the temperature was increased to 110 c for 3 h then the modified ws mws was washed several times with deionized water to remove the excess ca the mws was dried at 80 c for 24 h and stored in a plastic container in general a carboxylic group from the three carboxylic groups that are contained in the ca molecule reacts with the oh groups of the ws main constituents through an esterification reaction so the other two free carboxylic groups are available to bind metal ions additional details of this methodology can be found elsewhere 19 20 the treated ws samples were labeled as ws0 5 ws1 ws1 5 and ws2 depending on the concentration of citric acid used 2 4 characterization of natural and modified walnut pecan shell 2 4 1 textural characterization the textural properties of ws and ws2 surface area sbet pore volume vp and average pore diameter dp were determined by the adsorption of n2 at 77 k using a surface area and porosimetry analyzer micromeritics asap 2020 the brunauer emmett and teller bet method and bjh method were applied to calculate the surface area and the pore size distribution respectively the solid density ρs was calculated by the helium displacement method using a helium pycnometer thus the particle density ρp and the void fraction εp were estimated using the following equations 1 ρ p ρ s 1 v p ρ s 2 ε p v p v p 1 ρ s 2 4 2 chemical characterization the ph of point of zero charge phpzc of biosorbents was determined by the titration acid base procedure proposed by kuzin and loskutov 21 the determination of phpzc was performed as follows 50 ml of 0 1 mol l nacl were added to 50 ml volumetric flasks the ph of the solutions in each flask was adjusted to 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 by adding appropriate amounts of 0 1 mol l naoh or hcl solutions afterwards 0 1 g of biosorbent was added to a plastic container with 25 ml of each solution at different ph the remaining 25 ml in each flask were poured into a plastic container and denoted as blanks nitrogen was bubbled for 2 min on the solutions to prevent carbonates formation after 5 days the final ph of all solutions including the blanks was measured and graphed versus the volume added of naoh or hcl the intersection of both curves corresponded to the phpzc of the biosorbent the concentration of the active sites of materials was determined by the acid base titration method proposed by boehm 22 the total acidic and basic sites were neutralized with 0 01 m naoh and hcl solutions respectively the total acidic sites included the carboxylic phenolic and lactonic sites additionally the carboxylic sites were neutralized with a 0 01 m nahco3 solution and the carboxylic and lactonic sites with a 0 01 m na2co3 solution lastly the phenolic sites were estimated by subtracting the carboxylic and lactonic sites from the total acidic sites the titration procedure can be described as follows 0 1 g of biosorbent was placed into a plastic tube with 45 ml of neutralized solution the plastic tubes were immersed for seven days into a water bath at 25 c after equilibrium was reached a 20 ml aliquot was taken to be titrated with a naoh or hcl solution the morphology of the biosorbents was visualized using a scanning electron microscope jeol jsm 6330 f lastly the functional groups present in both adsorbents were identified with a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrophotometer thermo scientific nicolet is10 and using the technique of attenuated total reflectance atr 2 5 equilibrium adsorption experiments the adsorption capacity qe of ws and all treated ws towards zn ii was obtained from adsorption experiments carried out in a batch adsorber the adsorption equilibrium was analyzed with the following procedure a mass of 0 1 g of ws or treated ws and 40 ml of a solution with an initial concentration of zn ii ranging from 10 to 300 mg l were contacted in a batch adsorber plastic tube of 50 ml the adsorber was partially immersed in a thermostatic water bath and the solution was mixed twice a day for 15 min by placing the adsorber on top of an orbital shaker in preliminary experiments 7 days proved to be enough to attain equilibrium and during this period the ph of the adsorber solution was kept constant by adding a few drops of 0 01 m hno3 or naoh solutions after equilibrium was reached an aliquot of 5 ml was taken to determine the final concentration the mass adsorbed of zn ii per gram of adsorbent was calculated using the following equation 3 q v c a0 c ae m the adsorption equilibrium data were fitted by freundlich langmuir and prausnitz radkee adsorption isotherms models these models are mathematically represented by the following equations 4 q k c ae 1 n 5 q q m k c ae 1 k c ae 6 q a c ae 1 b c ae β the adsorption isotherms parameters were estimated by fitting the isotherm models to the experimental data using an optimization method which was based on the rosenbrock newton algorithm to select the better fit among the three isotherm models the average absolute percentage deviation d of each isotherm was also calculated the d is mathematically represented by the following equation 7 d 1 n i 1 n q exp q cal q exp 100 2 6 adsorption kinetic experiments the adsorption kinetics of zn ii onto the most effective treated ws were obtained in a rotating basket adsorber the mechanical characteristics and design of this adsorber have been given elsewhere 23 the adsorber was partially immersed in a constant temperature water bath a mass of 1 2 or 3 g of adsorbent was placed in the baskets and put in contact with 995 ml of a known concentration solution of zn ii from 60 to 600 mg l at ph 6 optimal ph this ph was obtained by mixing proper volumes of 0 01 mol l hno3 or naoh solutions the stirring speeds varied from 150 to 250 rpm an aliquot of 1 ml was periodically taken at different times and analyzed to determine the zn ii concentration then the dimensionless zn ii concentration was calculated with the following equation 8 φa ca ca0 the dimensionless zn ii concentration was plotted versus time to obtain the adsorption kinetic 3 results and discussion 3 1 textural and chemical characteristics of adsorbents fig 1 exhibits the ftir spectrums of ws ws0 5 ws1 0 ws1 5 ws2 and ws2 loaded with zn ii the spectrum corresponding to ws indicates the presence of different functional groups at wavelengths of 3317 cm 1 it displays a strong and broad oh stretching band the oh groups are attributed to the ch stretching band for the sp3 carbon atoms occurred at 2890 cm 1 ch are present in cellulose hemicellulose and lignin at 1710 cm 1 a co valence vibration of carboxylic groups appeared and a c o stretching band shows at 1200 and 1020 cm 1 wavelengths c o are characteristic in alcohols esters and carboxylics present in cellulose hemicellulose and lignin as observed in fig 1 upon modification the intensity of the co stretching band at 1710 cm 1 increased remarkably as the ca concentration augment revealing that an gradual amount of carboxylic groups was fixed during modification furthermore the decrease of the strong and broad oh stretching band at 3315 cm 1 reflects the esterification of the citric acid 24 fig 1 also exhibited the ftir spectrum of ws2 loaded with zn ii the most significant shifts were observed at 3317 cm 1 oh stretching band 1710 cm 1 co valence vibration of carboxylic groups and 1020 cm 1 c o stretching band the shifts of these bands may indicate the possibility of ws2 interacting with zn ii via these functional groups as an example the sem micrographs of ws and ws2 are shown in fig 2 it can be observed that the surfaces of ws and ws2 have a complex and multilayer structure any samples show the presence of certain cracks after modification there is no significant difference in the surface structure between ws and ws2 which indicates that the acid treatment at this concentration did not affect the main constituents of ws table 1 shows the values of the surface area for ws and all treated samples the values of the surface areas were in the range of 0 11 0 37 m2 g clearly it can be noticed that these materials are nonporous which was also observed with the sem images previously srinivasan and viraraghavan 25 altun and pehlivan 24 and teixeira et al 26 reported values of surface area for ws of 0 17 2 79 and 13 1 m2 g respectively altun and pehlivan 24 also reported for ws treated with citric acid surface area of 4 32 m2 g and teixeira et al 26 reported values of 12 6 and 9 1 m2 g for ws treated with hcl and naoh respectively the values of phpzc and the concentrations of active sites for ws and ws2 which were taken as reference biosorbents are exhibited in table 2 as observed the phpzc for ws and ws2 are 4 5 and 3 3 respectively thus both materials have most likely acidic surfaces the increase of acid sites content on the surface of ws2 due to the treatment it causes a decrease of phpzc moreover the total acidic sites concentrations of ws increased up to 2 3 times upon modification with ca 3 2 effect of the operational variables on the adsorption equilibrium the adsorption isotherms of zn ii on ws and all treated ws samples are displayed in fig 3 overall the adsorption capacity of zn ii was dependent of citric acid concentration the adsorption capacity of zn ii was gradually augmented by increasing the ca concentration in the following order 2 0 1 5 1 0 m 0 5 m in fig 3 it can be observed that the adsorption capacity of ws2 at equilibrium concentration of zn ii of 80 mg l was 2 4 times greater than that of ws the adsorption capacity of zn ii increased due to the actives sites that were incorporated on the material surface upon modification the carboxylic sites deprotonate in a ph range of 3 6 thus at the ph of work ph 7 the carboxylic sites are completely available to bind with the metal ions consequently increasing the adsorption capacity this aspect was corroborated by salazar rabago and leyva ramos 20 who modified natural sawdust through a hydrothermal procedure using citric malonic and tartaric acids to remove pb ii from aqueous solutions and observed that the adsorption capacity was almost linearly dependent on the concentration of carboxylic sites on the surface adsorbents table 2 shows the adsorption isotherm parameters obtained during the adsorption of zn ii on all adsorbents in this table is evident that prausnitz radke model provided the best fit since the average absolute percentage deviation d was the lowest this result was expected since prausnitz radke isotherm is a three parameter model while freundlich and langmuir isotherms are two parameters models it is well known that ph is an important parameter impacting on the adsorption process the solution ph significantly affects the ionization degree the metal chemistry and the material s surface properties the effect of solution ph on the adsorption isotherms is attributed to interactions between ions in solution and the adsorbent surface by determining the adsorption isotherms at ph of 3 5 6 and 7 the effect of the ph solution was studied on ws2 sample table 3 exhibits the adsorption isotherm parameters where it is evident that the prausnitz radke model interpreted in a better way the experimental data at different solution ph on the other hand fig 4 shows that the zn ii adsorption was significantly affected by the solution ph the adsorption capacity of ws2 was increased by 9 4 11 8 and 11 5 fold by augmenting the ph from 3 to 5 3 to 6 and 3 to 7 correspondingly the maximum zn ii adsorption occurred at ph 6 meanwhile at ph 7 the adsorption capacity of zn ii decreased slightly the speciation diagram for zn ii have been reported by several authors at ph 6 the zn2 form dominates while at ph 7 zn ii starts to precipitate as zn oh and zn oh 2 the point of zero charge ph phpzc is the ph of the solution at which the overall observed charge on the surface of the material is zero as it can be observed on table 1 the phpzc of ws2 was 3 3 the surface of ws2 was positively charged at ph 3 3 and negatively charged at ph 3 3 thus the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged surface and the zn ii ions in the solution favored the adsorption of zn ii on ws2 because the magnitude of the negative charge of surface augmented by raising the ph solution deprotonation of functional groups such as carboxylic groups occurs at increasing ph and these behave as negatively charged moieties attracting heavy metals 27 this could explained why at ph 7 the zn ii adsorption capacity decreased at ph 7 zn ii started to precipitate as zn oh and zn oh 2 resulting in reduced attraction between the zn ii ions and the ws2 similar results were reported by taha et al 27 some researchers have studied the adsorption of zn ii on several biosorbents all agreed that the optimum ph where the maximum mass of zn ii adsorbed was in the range of 5 and 6 8 table 4 exhibits that the maximum adsorption capacity qm of zn ii on ws2 was 28 58 mg g which is higher than that reported for bentonite and modified sawdust with formaldehyde and sodium hydroxide but slightly lower than carrot residue these results show that ws2 has a potential for removing zn ii ions from aqueous solutions 3 3 interpretation of overall adsorption rate in this work a diffusional model was used to interpret the adsorption rate of zn ii on ws2 this model was derived by assuming the following i intraparticle diffusion occurs by pore volume diffusion fick diffusion and surface diffusion ii the rate of adsorption on an active site is instantaneous and iii adsorbent particles are spherical model equations and initial and boundary conditions are 31 32 9 v d c a dt ms k l c a c ar r r p 10 t 0 c a c a0 11 ε p c ar t ρ p q t 1 r 2 r r

transport surface diffusion and pore volume diffusion mechanisms respectively 31 32 fig 5 exhibits the adsorption kinetic data of zn ii onto ws2 run 5 in this figure it can be noticed that the adsorption equilibrium is reached at 1200 min therefore to ensure all the experiments attained equilibrium they were carried out for 1700 min it was noted that the solution ph decreased during the adsorption of zn ii thus it was maintained constant ph 6 optimal ph by adding a few drops of 0 1 or 0 01 mol l naoh solutions the total added volume of these solutions was less than 2 ml the adsorption kinetic curves were obtained at various operating conditions such as agitation speed biosorbent mass and initial metal concentration all experimental conditions are listed in table 5 table 1 shows that the pore volume and porosity of ws2 are extremely small therefore it was assumed that the zn ii ions would not be able to diffuse throughout the pore volume dep 0 hence the contribution of the pore volume diffusion to the total intraparticle diffusion can be eliminated for this type of nonporous adsorbent therefore it was implicit that the overall adsorption rate of zn ii on ws2 can be well represented by the surface difusional model sdm to apply the sdm model the values of the external mass transfer coefficient kl and the surface diffusion coefficients ds are required experimental values of kl were estimated by the procedure proposed by furusawa and smith 33 which is based on the fact that when t 0 then car 0 and ca ca0 substituting these conditions in eq 9 16 can be obtained while the ds values were obtained by matching the numerical solution of the model to the experimental data the optimal value of ds was the value that best fitted the experimental data by minimizing the objective function given by eq 17 16 d c a c a0 dt t 0 ms k l v 17 1 n ϕ exp ϕ pred 2 minimum as a representative example fig 5 exhibits the experimental data of run 5 which was predicted by the sdm model as it can be seen the sdm model satisfactory predicts the experimental data the optimal value of ds was 3 10 10 9 cm2 s only a few researchers have reported adsorption rates of heavy metals onto biosorbents applying diffusional models garcía reyes and rangel mendez applied the sdm model to the adsorption rate of cr iii onto sorghum straw oats straw and agave bagasse 34 the values of ds obtained were 7 10 5 4 10 5 and 8 10 6 cm2 s respectively additionally they found that the ds values remained constant when increasing the initial metal concentration from 20 to 50 mg l and when increasing the agitation speed from 200 to 400 rpm it is important to remark that the values found in this work are almost four order of magnitude smaller than those reported by garcía reyes and rangel mendez 34 however taking into account that the molecular coefficient of cr iii in aqueous solutions at infinite dilution is 5 10 6 cm2 s 35 the ds values reported in the literature evidently lack physical meaning because these values indicate that cr iii molecules diffused much faster within the adsorbent pore volume than in the aqueous solution outside the pores in the literature ds values of the same magnitude order than those found in this work have been found but in different adsorbate adsorbent systems baskaralingam et al 36 performed adsorption and kinetic studies of orange reactive dye onto modified hectorites the ds value reported was 4 82 10 9 cm2 s ocampo pérez et al 37 studied the equilibrium and kinetic adsorption of organic compounds onto organobentonite applying the surface diffusion model sdm model the optimal ds values were 1 68 10 9 and 2 41 10 9 cm2 s for methylene blue and methyl blue respectively the effect of the mass of zn ii adsorbed at equilibrium qe on ds was studied by varying the initial concentration of zn ii and keeping constant the mass of ws2 or maintaining constant the initial concentration of zn ii and varying the mass of ws2 as an example fig 6 shows the experimental adsorption kinetics for runs 5 7 8 and 10 and their corresponding values of qe this figure depicts that the sdm model fitted the experimental data reasonably well and that the ds values augment by increasing qe this behavior was also obtained for runs 11 5 and 12 using masses of ws2 of 1 2 and 3 g respectively in general for all experimental conditions the sdm model interpreted very well the experimental data and the values of ds increased from 2 25 10 9 to 5 25 10 9 as the qe values augmented from 22 7 to 32 mg g respectively the surface diffusion is the movement of the adsorbate molecules along the pore surface of the adsorbent and its driving force is the surface concentration gradient q 32 hence the influence of qe on ds was attributed to that at the beginning the zn ii molecules were adsorbed on the higher adsorption energy sites therefore few of the adsorbed molecules had enough energy to move along the surface from one site to another once the sites with higher energy were occupied the zn ii molecules would be adsorbed on the low energy adsorption sites as a result the zn ii molecules in these sites would have greater ds values the ds dependency with respect to qe was interpreted by the equation proposed by sudo et al 38 represented as follows 18 d s d s0 e α q e using a nonlinear optimization method the values of ds0 and α were estimated and were ds0 9 02 10 8 cm2 s and α 0 052 g mg fig 7 shows the values of ds and the prediction of the eq 18 where it can be observed that it fits moderately well with the experimental data the value of ds0 indicates the highest value of ds obtained when qe 0 the mass transfer in a rotating basket adsorber depends on the agitation speed particle size and the adsorber geometry the effect of external mass transfer on the overall adsorption rate was studied by carrying out experiments at different agitation speeds but maintaining the same operational conditions run 1 3 fig 8 exhibited the graphs of zn ii concentration throughout the time from the experimental data obtained at agitation speeds of 150 200 and 250 rpm in this figure it can be shown that the sdm model predicts quite well the experimental data and the adsorption kinetics of 200 and 250 rpm are below the graph of 150 rpm additionally it was noticed that the experimental data at 200 and 250 rpm overlapped each other thus the external mass transfer resistance was not important at velocities greater than 200 rpm likewise fig 8 shows that kl values increased as the agitation speed increased from 150 to 250 rpm on the other hand the ds values augmented considerably as the agitation speed increased from 150 to 200 rpm but did not change much when increasing the agitation speed from 200 to 250 rpm therefore the ds value was not affected when augmenting the agitation speed to 250 rpm an additional way to analyze the importance of the external mass transfer was used to interpret the experimental data with the best value of ds and varying the kl value for example fig 9 shows the experimental data and the prediction of the sdm model for run 10 using the best value of ds 5 25 10 9 cm2 s and its corresponding value of kl 2 50 10 6 cm s besides this figure includes the prediction of the sdm model using values of kl of 1 50 10 6 and 8 20 10 6 cm s these values correspond to the minimal and maximum values of kl reported in table 3 for 250 rpm fig 9 shows that the three predictions of the sdm model remain practically constant indicating that at a 250 rpm agitation speed the overall rate adsorption of zn ii onto ws2 is not affected by the external mass transfer 4 conclusions the adsorption capacity of ws modified with citric acid increases 2 5 times its adsorption capacity to remove zn ii from aqueous solutions due to the incorporation of carboxylic groups the overall adsorption rate of zn ii on ws2 is controlled by intraparticle diffusion because the effects of the external mass transport are minimized when the experiments are carried out at stirring rates greater than 200 rpm the adsorption kinetics of zn ii on ws2 were interpreted correctly by the sdm model which assumes that zn ii ions will not be able to diffuse throughout the pore volume due to its null porosity the values of ds varied from 2 25 to 5 25 10 9 cm2 s and increased exponentially as the mass of zn ii adsorbed at equilibrium augmented acknowledgments this work was funded by consejo nacional de ciencia y tecnología national council of science and
