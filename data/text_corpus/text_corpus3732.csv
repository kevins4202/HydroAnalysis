18660,the pyrolysis kinetics of sewage sludge was studied to determine the constituent of sludge and explore the feasibility of pyrolytic post treatment both flocculent sludge and granular sludge were pyrolysed in a thermogravimetric analyser under inert atmospheric conditions the pyrolysis of granular sludge and flocculent sludge were described by three parallel reactions model with three individual pseudo components the decomposition activation energy values of the three pseudo components were determined by iso conversional methods to be 263 97 kj mol 257 18 kj mol and 153 61 kj mol in flocculent sludge and 139 89 kj mol 228 78 kj mol and 142 78 kj mol in granular sludge respectively granular sludge exhibited better thermal stability but lower devolatilisation activation energy than flocculent sludge which could be attributed by enriched alkali and alkaline metals during granulation master plots of experimental data sets suggested that the decomposition of all organic pseudo components of flocculent sludge followed the nth order mechanism while the pyrolytic mechanism of the first organic fraction in granular sludge coincided with random nucleation and nuclei growth by

sludge pyrolysis and whether pyrolysis is suitable for gs treatment are still unknown this study was therefore designed to explore the pyrolytic behaviour of aerobic gs in comparison with fs dried sludge samples gs and fs were pyrolysed in a thermogravimetric analyser at different heating rates overlapping differential data were deconvolved into several individual peaks representing different pseudo components the respective activation energy and reaction mechanism of each pseudo component was estimated by the isoconversional method and the master plot method by investigating the pyrolytic behaviour this study provides an in depth comparison between fs and gs and offers a post treatment customised to gs 2 materials and methods 2 1 granulation and sludge collection activated sludge was granulated in a sequencing batch airlift reactor sbar with the same operating cycle and influent characteristics as those reported by li et al 2017a the percentage of seawater in the influent was controlled at 20 by volume to mimic the salinity of the local wastewater treatment plant the components of synthetic sewage and reactor configuration are provided in supplementary information si seeding fs was taken from a local wastewater treatment plant in hong kong gs was sampled after 60 days of reactor operation to obtain representative sludge samples 1000 ml of sludge mixed liquid were transferred into a constant mixed beaker and then 50 ml cubes were collected the fs and mature gs samples were washed with ultrapure water after collection and subsequently lyophilised the freeze dried biomass was then stored at 20 c or below as the precursor for pyrolysis 2 2 characterization of sludge samples 2 2 1 wet basis analysis mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss of sludge samples were measured according to standard methods apha 2005 the distribution of sludge particle size was determined with a laser diffraction particle size analyser lsi3 320 beckman coulter the morphology of gs was examined under a scanning electron microscope jsm 6390 jeol after fixation overnight at 4 c in a 1 phosphate buffered saline mixed with 2 paraformaldehyde and 2 glutaraldehyde as microbial aggregates extracellular polymeric substances eps can account for a large fraction of the sludge mass flemming and wingender 2010 eps were extracted from sludge samples following the high temperature sodium carbonate extraction method introduced by lin et al 2013 the polysaccharide content in the extracted supernatant was then quantified using a phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as the standard dubois et al 1956 the protein content was also determined using a modified lowry colorimetric method dc protein assay biorad with bovine serum albumin as the standard frølund et al 1995 all analyses were conducted in triplicate 2 2 2 dry basis analysis proximate analysis and ultimate analysis were conducted on dried sludge samples the moisture content was measured according to astm e871 82 2013 the ash content was determined according to astm e1755 01 2015 the volatile matter content was analysed according to astm e872 82 2013 the fixed carbon content was calculated based on the following equation 1 fixed carbon 100 moisture ash volatile matter the c h s and n contents in sludge were quantified using an elementar vario macro cube germany the mineral contents in sludge were examined with an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer 725 es varian after digestion sandroni and smith 2002 thermogravimetric tg and differential thermogravimetric dtg tests of dried fs and gs were performed with a thermogravimetric analyser q5000 ta instruments usa to minimize the heat transfer difference caused by different particle sizes both fs and gs were meshed to small particles with a mean size of around 100 μm before pyrolysis then a small amount of sludge samples was heated from room temperature to 800 c at 5 10 20 and 30 c min argon with a flow rate of 25 ml min 1 was selected as the carrier gas for the experiment 2 3 solid state pyrolysis kinetics a single step pyrolysis reaction is often expressed in mathematical form as follows 2 d α d t k t f α where α represents the degree of conversion t indicates time k t denotes the dependence of the rate constant on temperature t and f α describes the reaction mechanism however considering the heterogeneous nature of sludge a multi step expression 3 d α d t 1 j γ j d α j d t γ 1 k 1 t f 1 α 1 γ 2 k 2 t f 2 α 2 γ j k j t f j α j is more appropriate subscript j distinguishes different pseudo components involved in sludge pyrolysis and each component has its own k t and f α γ j represents the mass loss ratio of the j th pseudo component of total mass loss eq 4 the arrhenius equation has been widely accepted to parameterize the temperature dependence of the process rate 4 k t aexp e r t thus for a single pseudo component pyrolysis reaction the reaction rate of the j th pseudo component becomes eq 5 5 d α j d t a j exp e j r t f j α j where a j e j r j and t j are the pre exponential factor activation energy universal gas constant and temperature respectively 2 4 identification of pseudo components by dtg signal deconvolution kinetic analysis includes model fitting methods and model free methods model fitting methods are often criticized for their empirical nature vyazovkin and wight 1999 while model free methods also known as isoconversional methods can compute the activation energy without assumption of reaction mechanism however due to the involvement of multiple solid state reactions in pyrolysis combination of model fitting methods and isoconversional methods is often required anca couce et al 2014 since a single step approximation is not sufficient to describe the pyrolysis of biomass dtg signals have been mathematically deconvolved to study the pyrolysis kinetics of complexed samples with overlapping dtg peaks brachi et al 2016 chen et al 2017 in this study dtg signals from the devolatilisation stage were deconvolved using the peak fitting function in originpro 2017 software to study the pyrolysis kinetics of organic matter decomposition for each sludge sample the symmetrical gaussian model which led to the highest r square was chosen to fit the experimental data after testing different peak functions lorentz weibull bi gaussian etc 2 5 estimation of kinetic triplets kinetic triplets include activation energy pre exponential factor and reaction mechanism iso conversional methods which assume that the reaction rate is only a function of temperature at a constant degree of conversion can reveal the activation energy of a certain pyrolysis reaction without knowledge of its reaction mechanism f α both differential friedman 1964 and integral flynn wall ozawa fwo and kissinger akahira sunose kas methods flynn and wall 1966 ozawa 1965 kissinger 1956 akahira and sunose 1971 were adopted to calculate the activation energy of pseudo components decompositions of fs and gs during pyrolysis in this study detailed equations are also shown in si if the dependence of activation energy remain nearly constant with degree of conversion the average activation energy can be used as the initial value for estimating pre exponential factor and reaction mechanism master plots methods have been widely adopted to estimate the mechanism of solid state reactions gotor et al 2000 the principle equation is eq 6 which conveys the idea of sketching all theoretical plots and determine the most probable mechanisms detailed derivation of master plot method is provided in si 6 g α g 0 5 θ θ 0 5 p x p x 0 5 comparing theoretical g α g 0 5 plots with experimental p x p x 0 5 plots one can determine which theoretical mechanism the experimental plot is close to the most probable mechanisms were summarized in table s 2 2 6 validation of kinetic triplets to evaluate the accuracy of calculated activation energy e reaction order n and pre exponential factor a the model was validated against experimental results reconstruction of dα dt curve was performed by rewriting eq 5 7 after obtaining all kinetic triplets 7 d t d α j β e e j r t ln a f α calculated activation energy e j pre exponential factor a and reaction mechanism f α were substituted into eq 7 forming an ordinary differential equation that can be numerically solved by means of the classical fourth order runge kutta method then simulated dα dt versus t curve can be obtained and compared with experimental results the average deviation percentage avp in eq 8 proposed by orfao et al 1999 was used to evaluate the accuracy of simulated results 8 a v p 100 i 1 n d α d t i exp d α d t i c a l c n 2 d α d t max n is the number of data points dα dt exp represents the measured value dα dt calc represents the simulated results dα dt max is the maximum of experimental dα dt value 3 results 3 1 development of granular sludge and wet basis characteristics the sludge particles gradually grew larger during the granulation process fig 1 small granules started to appear from day 20 onwards while most of the sludge in the reactor was still present as flocs granules formation underwent continuous breakage and regranulation from cell adhesion to maturation verawaty et al 2013 the activity and biological performance of granules reached steady state after 40 days operation see si mature gs samples with a mean size of 1298 μm and a smooth round shape were collected at day 60 comparing the mlvss mlss ratios of fs and gs fig 2 a gs had larger inorganic fractions than fs most likely due to the trapping of mineral ions during the granulation process wan et al 2014 the total amounts of eps extracted from fs and gs by the high temperature sodium carbonate method were 553 9 66 2 and 554 8 42 4 mg g vss respectively which were similar however gs had higher proportions of proteins in terms of extracted organic fractions fig 2b 3 2 proximate analysis and ultimate analysis of dried sludge results of proximate analysis table 1 showed consistency with mlss mlvss measurements with a higher ash fraction observed in gs mineral analysis revealed that most of the ash content was made up of calcium or sodium dominated species which probably originated from the involvement of seawater in the influent sewage sludge fs and gs tends to have higher ash and lower fixed carbon contents than do woody biomass feedstock and coal syed hassan et al 2017 considering that the energy consumption of dewatering accounts for 30 50 of the annual operating costs of a sewage treatment plant mikkelsen and keiding 2002 sewage sludge might not be a competitive enough feedstock for energy production from pyrolysis however the ash content present in sludge can also catalytically promote secondary cracking of tar to form char by altering the thermal degradation routes tang et al 2018 the role of ash in slow pyrolysis could be very subtle when considering specific chemical species especially alkali and alkaline earth metallic aaem species e g na k mg and ca for instance shie et al 2003 found addition of sodium and potassium compounds enhanced the reaction rate of sludge pyrolysis and quyn et al 2003 suggested that sodium species could bind to the char matrix during slow pyrolysis to improve the char reactivity 3 3 thermal decomposition behaviour of fs and gs during slow pyrolysis tg and dtg curves fig 3 revealed that the pyrolysis of fs and gs occurred in three stages dehydration devolatilisation and mineral decomposition dehydration mainly refers to the elimination of cellular and external bound water below 200 c that cannot be removed during freeze drying devolatilisation and mineral decomposition represent the destruction of the organic and inorganic fractions of sludge respectively the thermal profiles of both fs and gs shifted towards higher temperatures at higher heating rates which is also known as thermal lag antal et al 1998 this thermal lag effect usually results from heat and mass transfer limitations and extra time is required for the carrier gas to transfer heat to the sample due to this effect the actual range of temperatures for each stage of decomposition to occur would be slightly different at different heating rates the dtg signals of fs and gs were different with overlapping peaks implying the involvement of different components in each devolatilisation process a detailed investigation of the devolatilisation dtg signals was conducted subsequently 3 4 deconvolution of the devolatilisation dtg signals of fs and gs to track the organic fraction change during sludge granulation devolatilisation dtg signals derivative weight of temperature of both fs and gs were deconvolved into three individual peaks fig 4 representing three kinds of pseudo component decomposition the more reactions are involved the better the fit that can be obtained actual reaction numbers chosen should be based on the initial understanding of the chemical composition of the sample in this study the organic fractions of fs and gs were considered to be mostly composed of polysaccharides proteins and dead microorganisms harrison et al 2006 the initial and final devolatilisation temperatures of both gs and fs samples were determined by finding the corresponding t value of the minimum dtg value between 100 300 c and 500 700 c properties of individual peaks are summarized in table 2 devolatilisation of gs initiated at higher temperature than that of fs with an apparent lower reactivity of pseudo component a1 than pseudo component a2 pseudo components b1 and c1 of fs and pseudo components b2 and c2 of gs likely share the same chemical nature with similar peak temperatures but maximum rates of weight loss were slightly different pseudo component b was enriched during the granulation process with a relative weight increase of around 25 regarding the whole weight loss of devolatilisation however it had been pointed out by thipkhunthod et al 2007 that due to the regression method taken δw might be varied arbitrarily during the iteration to achieve a better fit the δw determined by mathematical deconvolution might not be an accurate representation of the actual relative weight of a certain pseudo component 3 5 kinetic analysis of pseudo component decomposition the apparent activation energy values of three pseudo components of fs and gs were in the range of α 0 1 0 9 with 0 05 increments using friedman fwo and kas methods according to ictac s recommendation vyazovkin et al 2011 the individual peaks were extracted from the dtg curve and are plotted together in fig s1 fitting lines of each regression are presented in fig s2 calculated activated energy values are summarized in table s1 eα vs α dependencies are presented in fig 5 the average e0 values of decomposition reactions of pseudo components a1 b1 and c1 of fs were determined by the fwo method to be 263 97 kj mol 257 18 kj mol and 153 61 kj mol respectively the respective average e0 values of pseudo components a2 b2 and c2 of gs were determined by the same method to be 139 89 kj mol 228 78 kj mol and 142 78 kj mol the apparent activation energy of the devolatilisation of gs was lower than that of fs indicating that less energy was required for the pyrolysis treatment of gs none of the calculated activation energy values of the pseudo components varied significantly with the degree of conversion implying that the decomposition of each pseudo component could be approximated by a single step reaction thus the mechanism of each reaction could be estimated by a master plot 3 6 estimation of reaction mechanisms pre exponential factor and validation decomposition reactions of all pseudo components can be described by nth order mechanisms except for pseudo component a2 in gs whose decomposition behaviour was closer to random nucleation and nuclei growth fig 6 the values of reaction order and pre exponential factor under different heating rates were summarized in table s 3 kinetic triplets e a f α of different pseudo components were presented in table 4 wu et al 2014 suggested that the reaction order as fitting parameters could be affected by the temperature range chosen for kinetics estimation to validate these parameters reconstruction of dα dt curve was conducted using obtained kinetic triplets by isoconversional and master plot methods simulated results fitted well with experimental results fig 7 under the heating rate of 10 c min and the avps are 5 9 and 5 3 for fs and gs indicating the calculated parameters were reliable 4 discussion 4 1 interpretation of pseudo components three parallel reactions tpr model is well accepted for pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass with three pseudo components including hemicelluloses cellulose and lignin orfao et al 1999 as non lignocellulosic biomass interpretations of the pseudo components in sludge vary from study to study table 3 in this work the eps contents of gs contained higher protein fractions than did the eps contents of fs and pseudo component b was enriched after granulation pseudo components b1 and b2 are likely to be proteins with a decomposition apparent activation energy of around 250 kj mol bach and chen 2017 the decomposition reaction of dead bacteria at temperatures ranging from 300 to 400 c had an apparent activation energy of 169 7 kj mol font et al 2005 which could be related to the decomposition of pseudo components c1 and c2 in this study however one might argue that bacterial cell walls are chemically composed of polysaccharides as well mcmurry 2004 the intracellular and extracellular organic matter of fs or gs are clearly different tu et al 2012 meanwhile proteins and polysaccharides are rather coarse classifications of organic chemicals whose thermal decomposition behaviour could vary from one chemical structure to another carrier et al 2011 pseudo component a1 in fs seemed to be a different kind of organics from pseudo component a2 in gs the peak temperature and apparent activation energy of the decomposition of pseudo component a2 of gs were around 220 c and 140 kj mol respectively li et al 2010 studied the pyrolysis of sodium alginate and reported the activation energy value of 188 1 kj mol with the peak decomposition temperature of around 230 c which are close to those of pseudo component a2 in this study associated with the presence of alginate like polysaccharides in gs lin et al 2013 pseudo component a2 in this study is very likely to be alginate like polysaccharides alginate polysaccharides are regarded as a promoter of sludge granulation with a content of around 160 mg g vss in gs 4 2 catalytic effect of aaem species the activation energy of the decomposition of pseudo components b2 and c2 was slightly lower than that of the decomposition of pseudo components b1 and c1 which could be attributed to the catalytic effect of higher proportions of aaem species table 1 abundant calcium and sodium species were found in gs more than double the amount in fs which might catalyse pyrolysis nassar 1998 found that the presence of alkaline salts whether added or innate tended to lower the apparent activation energy of organic matter decomposition the calcium and sodium species in gs mainly existed as precipitates and cation bridges in eps as investigated in our previous research li et al 2017b aaem ions existed as cation bridges were supposed to be more reactive than those fixed in ashes as precipitates because they could complex to hydroxyl groups and alter the carbon ring configuration evans and milne 1987 moreover although decomposition of ash is considered to start at temperature of higher than 600 c release of alkali metal species could occur at lower temperature region synergistically with devolatilisation olsson et al 1997 where metal could interact with organic polymers and facilitate depolymerization process like ring opening and scission of side groups saddawi et al 2012 the detailed catalytic mechanisms of aaem species during sludge devolatilisation deserve a further investigation 4 3 gs is more molecularly rigid than fs decomposition of larger amount of organics at higher temperatures in gs indicates that gs is more thermally stable compared with fs a high thermal stability normally relates to strong chemical bonds within certain compositions liu et al 2016 it has been found that the shortened hydrogen bonding distance between different amino acids is responsible for the improved thermal stability of the bacterium clostridium thermocellum anbar et al 2012 moreover the high decomposition temperatures of certain pseudo components of sludge are associated with their large molecular weights for instance higher decomposition temperatures were required for digested sludge due to the depletion of labile organic matter after anaerobic digestion li et al 2017a b analogously the higher temperatures required for the decomposition of chemical linkages in gs implies a more compact molecular organization on the other hand the lower activation energy value obtained for gs seemed to contradict its higher thermal stability and enrichment of refractory organics similar results were reported by ma et al 2019 showing a higher decomposition temperature of sewage sludge with a lower activation energy after hydrothermal pretreatment other than the possibility of catalytic effects of aaem species as discussed above it should be noted that thermal stability is not only governed by activation energy pre exponential factor and reaction mechanism also affect the sensitivity of a sample to temperature the low pre exponential factor often indicates a tight complex with few reaction sites while the high pre exponential factor indicates a loose complex with abundant reaction sites given the lower surface area of gs than fs fig s5 fewer reaction sites in gs exposed to elevated temperature is likely another reason for the lower sensitivity of gs to temperature than fs the reaction mechanism of all pseudo components followed nth order mechanisms except for pseudo component a2 in gs whose decomposition was better described by random nucleation and growth indeed melting of polymers took place ahead of depolymerization and most polymers thermally degraded in the liquid state where nth order mechanisms should apply vyazovkin 2015 however at low temperature high thermal stability and molecular rigidity of gs restricted the melting of organic polymer the decomposition of pseudo component a2 might behave like crystals requiring the heterogeneous nucleation of the volatile wang et al 2006 5 conclusion the pyrolysis of gs and fs was investigated in this study tg dtg analysis revealed that the devolatilisation stage of fs and gs could be described by three parallel reactions with three major pseudo components gs was proven to be more thermally stable than fs and the decomposition behaviors of pseudo components in two forms of sludge varied with different kinetics parameters the apparent activation energy of the decomposition of gs was calculated by isoconversional methods to be lower than that of fs most likely due to the catalytic effect of more alkaline minerals present in gs master plots of experimental data sets suggested that the decomposition of all organic pseudo components of fs followed the nth order mechanism while the pyrolytic mechanism of the first organic fraction in gs coincided with random nucleation and nuclei growth declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

dried biomass was then stored at 20 c or below as the precursor for pyrolysis 2 2 characterization of sludge samples 2 2 1 wet basis analysis mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss of sludge samples were measured according to standard methods apha 2005 the distribution of sludge particle size was determined with a laser diffraction particle size analyser lsi3 320 beckman coulter the morphology of gs was examined under a scanning electron microscope jsm 6390 jeol after fixation overnight at 4 c in a 1 phosphate buffered saline mixed with 2 paraformaldehyde and 2 glutaraldehyde as microbial aggregates extracellular polymeric substances eps can account for a large fraction of the sludge mass flemming and wingender 2010 eps were extracted from sludge samples following the high temperature sodium carbonate extraction method introduced by lin et al 2013 the polysaccharide content in the extracted supernatant was then quantified using a phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as the standard dubois et al 1956 the protein content was also determined using a modified lowry colorimetric method dc protein assay biorad with bovine serum albumin as the standard frølund et al 1995 all analyses were conducted in triplicate 2 2 2 dry basis analysis proximate analysis and ultimate analysis were conducted on dried sludge samples the moisture content was measured according to astm e871 82 2013 the ash content was determined according to astm e1755 01 2015 the volatile matter content was analysed according to astm e872 82 2013 the fixed carbon content was calculated based on the following equation 1 fixed carbon 100 moisture ash volatile matter the c h s and n contents in sludge were quantified using an elementar vario macro cube germany the mineral contents in sludge were examined with an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer 725 es varian after digestion sandroni and smith 2002 thermogravimetric tg and differential thermogravimetric dtg tests of dried fs and gs were performed with a thermogravimetric analyser q5000 ta instruments usa to minimize the heat transfer difference caused by different particle sizes both fs and gs were meshed to small particles with a mean size of around 100 μm before pyrolysis then a small amount of sludge samples was heated from room temperature to 800 c at 5 10 20 and 30 c min argon with a flow rate of 25 ml min 1 was selected as the carrier gas for the experiment 2 3 solid state pyrolysis kinetics a single step pyrolysis reaction is often expressed in mathematical form as follows 2 d α d t k t f α where α represents the degree of conversion t indicates time k t denotes the dependence of the rate constant on temperature t and f α describes the reaction mechanism however considering the heterogeneous nature of sludge a multi step expression 3 d α d t 1 j γ j d α j d t γ 1 k 1 t f 1 α 1 γ 2 k 2 t f 2 α 2 γ j k j t f j α j is more appropriate subscript j distinguishes different pseudo components involved in sludge pyrolysis and each component has its own k t and f α γ j represents the mass loss ratio of the j th pseudo component of total mass loss eq 4 the arrhenius equation has been widely accepted to parameterize the temperature dependence of the process rate 4 k t aexp e r t thus for a single pseudo component pyrolysis reaction the reaction rate of the j th pseudo component becomes eq 5 5 d α j d t a j exp e j r t f j α j where a j e j r j and t j are the pre exponential factor activation energy universal gas constant and temperature respectively 2 4 identification of pseudo components by dtg signal deconvolution kinetic analysis includes model fitting methods and model free methods model fitting methods are often criticized for their empirical nature vyazovkin and wight 1999 while model free methods also known as isoconversional methods can compute the activation energy without assumption of reaction mechanism however due to the involvement of multiple solid state reactions in pyrolysis combination of model fitting methods and isoconversional methods is often required anca couce et al 2014 since a single step approximation is not sufficient to describe the pyrolysis of biomass dtg signals have been mathematically deconvolved to study the pyrolysis kinetics of complexed samples with overlapping dtg peaks brachi et al 2016 chen et al 2017 in this study dtg signals from the devolatilisation stage were deconvolved using the peak fitting function in originpro 2017 software to study the pyrolysis kinetics of organic matter decomposition for each sludge sample the symmetrical gaussian model which led to the highest r square was chosen to fit the experimental data after testing different peak functions lorentz weibull bi gaussian etc 2 5 estimation of kinetic triplets kinetic triplets include activation energy pre exponential factor and reaction mechanism iso conversional methods which assume that the reaction rate is only a function of temperature at a constant degree of conversion can reveal the activation energy of a certain pyrolysis reaction without knowledge of its reaction mechanism f α both differential friedman 1964 and integral flynn wall ozawa fwo and kissinger akahira sunose kas methods flynn and wall 1966 ozawa 1965 kissinger 1956 akahira and sunose 1971 were adopted to calculate the activation energy of pseudo components decompositions of fs and gs during pyrolysis in this study detailed equations are also shown in si if the dependence of activation energy remain nearly constant with degree of conversion the average activation energy can be used as the initial value for estimating pre exponential factor and reaction mechanism master plots methods have been widely adopted to estimate the mechanism of solid state reactions gotor et al 2000 the principle equation is eq 6 which conveys the idea of sketching all theoretical plots and determine the most probable mechanisms detailed derivation of master plot method is provided in si 6 g α g 0 5 θ θ 0 5 p x p x 0 5 comparing theoretical g α g 0 5 plots with experimental p x p x 0 5 plots one can determine which theoretical mechanism the experimental plot is close to the most probable mechanisms were summarized in table s 2 2 6 validation of kinetic triplets to evaluate the accuracy of calculated activation energy e reaction order n and pre exponential factor a the model was validated against experimental results reconstruction of dα dt curve was performed by rewriting eq 5 7 after obtaining all kinetic triplets 7 d t d α j β e e j r t ln a f α calculated activation energy e j pre exponential factor a and reaction mechanism f α were substituted into eq 7 forming an ordinary differential equation that can be numerically solved by means of the classical fourth order runge kutta method then simulated dα dt versus t curve can be obtained and compared with experimental results the average deviation percentage avp in eq 8 proposed by orfao et al 1999 was used to evaluate the accuracy of simulated results 8 a v p 100 i 1 n d α d t i exp d α d t i c a l c n 2 d α d t max n is the number of data points dα dt exp represents the measured value dα dt calc represents the simulated results dα dt max is the maximum of experimental dα dt value 3 results 3 1 development of granular sludge and wet basis characteristics the sludge particles gradually grew larger during the granulation process fig 1 small granules started to appear from day 20 onwards while most of the sludge in the reactor was still present as flocs granules formation underwent continuous breakage and regranulation from cell adhesion to maturation verawaty et al 2013 the activity and biological performance of granules reached steady state after 40 days operation see si mature gs samples with a mean size of 1298 μm and a smooth round shape were collected at day 60 comparing the mlvss mlss ratios of fs and gs fig 2 a gs had larger inorganic fractions than fs most likely due to the trapping of mineral ions during the granulation process wan et al 2014 the total amounts of eps extracted from fs and gs by the high temperature sodium carbonate method were 553 9 66 2 and 554 8 42 4 mg g vss respectively which were similar however gs had higher proportions of proteins in terms of extracted organic fractions fig 2b 3 2 proximate analysis and ultimate analysis of dried sludge results of proximate analysis table 1 showed consistency with mlss mlvss measurements with a higher ash fraction observed in gs mineral analysis revealed that most of the ash content was made up of calcium or sodium dominated species which probably originated from the involvement of seawater in the influent sewage sludge fs and gs tends to have higher ash and lower fixed carbon contents than do woody biomass feedstock and coal syed hassan et al 2017 considering that the energy consumption of dewatering accounts for 30 50 of the annual operating costs of a sewage treatment plant mikkelsen and keiding 2002 sewage sludge might not be a competitive enough feedstock for energy production from pyrolysis however the ash content present in sludge can also catalytically promote secondary cracking of tar to form char by altering the thermal degradation routes tang et al 2018 the role of ash in slow pyrolysis could be very subtle when considering specific chemical species especially alkali and alkaline earth metallic aaem species e g na k mg and ca for instance shie et al 2003 found addition of sodium and potassium compounds enhanced the reaction rate of sludge pyrolysis and quyn et al 2003 suggested that sodium species could bind to the char matrix during slow pyrolysis to improve the char reactivity 3 3 thermal decomposition behaviour of fs and gs during slow pyrolysis tg and dtg curves fig 3 revealed that the pyrolysis of fs and gs occurred in three stages dehydration devolatilisation and mineral decomposition dehydration mainly refers to the elimination of cellular and external bound water below 200 c that cannot be removed during freeze drying devolatilisation and mineral decomposition represent the destruction of the organic and inorganic fractions of sludge respectively the thermal profiles of both fs and gs shifted towards higher temperatures at higher heating rates which is also known as thermal lag antal et al 1998 this thermal lag effect usually results from heat and mass transfer limitations and extra time is required for the carrier gas to transfer heat to the sample due to this effect the actual range of temperatures for each stage of decomposition to occur would be slightly different at different heating rates the dtg signals of fs and gs were different with overlapping peaks implying the involvement of different components in each devolatilisation process a detailed investigation of the devolatilisation dtg signals was conducted subsequently 3 4 deconvolution of the devolatilisation dtg signals of fs and gs to track the organic fraction change during sludge granulation devolatilisation dtg signals derivative weight of temperature of both fs and gs were deconvolved into three individual peaks fig 4 representing three kinds of pseudo component decomposition the more reactions are involved the better the fit that can be obtained actual reaction numbers chosen should be based on the initial understanding of the chemical composition of the sample in this study the organic fractions of fs and gs were considered to be mostly composed of polysaccharides proteins and dead microorganisms harrison et al 2006 the initial and final devolatilisation temperatures of both gs and fs samples were determined by finding the corresponding t value of the minimum dtg value between 100 300 c and 500 700 c properties of individual peaks are summarized in table 2 devolatilisation of gs initiated at higher temperature than that of fs with an apparent lower reactivity of pseudo component a1 than pseudo component a2 pseudo components b1 and c1 of fs and pseudo components b2 and c2 of gs likely share the same chemical nature with similar peak temperatures but maximum rates of weight loss were slightly different pseudo component b was enriched during the granulation process with a relative weight increase of around 25 regarding the whole weight loss of devolatilisation however it had been pointed out by thipkhunthod et al 2007 that due to the regression method taken δw might be varied arbitrarily during the iteration to achieve a better fit the δw determined by mathematical deconvolution might not be an accurate representation of the actual relative weight of a certain pseudo component 3 5 kinetic analysis of pseudo component decomposition the apparent activation energy values of three pseudo components of fs and gs were in the range of α 0 1 0 9 with 0 05 increments using friedman fwo and kas methods according to ictac s recommendation vyazovkin et al 2011 the individual peaks were extracted from the dtg curve and are plotted together in fig s1 fitting lines of each regression are presented in fig s2 calculated activated energy values are summarized in table s1 eα vs α dependencies are presented in fig 5 the average e0 values of decomposition reactions of pseudo components a1 b1 and c1 of fs were determined by the fwo method to be 263 97 kj mol 257 18 kj mol and 153 61 kj mol respectively the respective average e0 values of pseudo components a2 b2 and c2 of gs were determined by the same method to be 139 89 kj mol 228 78 kj mol and 142 78 kj mol the apparent activation energy of the devolatilisation of gs was lower than that of fs indicating that less energy was required for the pyrolysis treatment of gs none of the calculated activation energy values of the pseudo components varied significantly with the degree of conversion implying that the decomposition of each pseudo component could be approximated by a single step reaction thus the mechanism of each reaction could be estimated by a master plot 3 6 estimation of reaction mechanisms pre exponential factor and validation decomposition reactions of all pseudo components can be described by nth order mechanisms except for pseudo component a2 in gs whose decomposition behaviour was closer to random nucleation and nuclei growth fig 6 the values of reaction order and pre exponential factor under different heating rates were summarized in table s 3 kinetic triplets e a f α of different pseudo components were presented in table 4 wu et al 2014 suggested that the reaction order as fitting parameters could be affected by the temperature range chosen for kinetics estimation to validate these parameters reconstruction of dα dt curve was conducted using obtained kinetic triplets by isoconversional and master plot methods simulated results fitted well with experimental results fig 7 under the heating rate of 10 c min and the avps are 5 9 and 5 3 for fs and gs indicating the calculated parameters were reliable 4 discussion 4 1 interpretation of pseudo components three parallel reactions tpr model is well accepted for pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass with three pseudo components including hemicelluloses cellulose and lignin orfao et al 1999 as non lignocellulosic biomass interpretations of the pseudo components in sludge vary from study to study table 3 in this work the eps contents of gs contained higher protein fractions than did the eps contents of fs and pseudo component b was enriched after granulation pseudo components b1 and b2 are likely to be proteins with a decomposition apparent activation energy of around 250 kj mol bach and chen 2017 the decomposition reaction of dead bacteria at temperatures ranging from 300 to 400 c had an apparent activation energy of 169 7 kj mol font et al 2005 which could be related to the decomposition of pseudo components c1 and c2 in this study however one might argue that bacterial cell walls are chemically composed of polysaccharides as well mcmurry 2004 the intracellular and extracellular organic matter of fs or gs are clearly different tu et al 2012 meanwhile proteins and polysaccharides are rather coarse classifications of organic chemicals whose thermal decomposition behaviour could vary from one chemical structure to another carrier et al 2011 pseudo component a1 in fs seemed to be a different kind of organics from pseudo component a2 in gs the peak temperature and apparent activation energy of the decomposition of pseudo component a2 of gs were around 220 c and 140 kj mol respectively li et al 2010 studied the pyrolysis of sodium alginate and reported the activation energy value of 188 1 kj mol with the peak decomposition temperature of around 230 c which are close to those of pseudo component a2 in this study associated with the presence of alginate like polysaccharides in gs lin et al 2013 pseudo component a2 in this study is very likely to be alginate like polysaccharides alginate polysaccharides are regarded as a promoter of sludge granulation with a content of around 160 mg g vss in gs 4 2 catalytic effect of aaem species the activation energy of the decomposition of pseudo components b2 and c2 was slightly lower than that of the decomposition of pseudo components b1 and c1 which could be attributed to the catalytic effect of higher proportions of aaem species table 1 abundant calcium and sodium species were found in gs more than double the amount in fs which might catalyse pyrolysis nassar 1998 found that the presence of alkaline salts whether added or innate tended to lower the apparent activation energy of organic matter decomposition the calcium and sodium species in gs mainly existed as precipitates and cation bridges in eps as investigated in our previous research li et al 2017b aaem ions existed as cation bridges were supposed to be more reactive than those fixed in ashes as precipitates because they could complex to hydroxyl groups and alter the carbon ring configuration evans and milne 1987 moreover although decomposition of ash is considered to start at temperature of higher than 600 c release of alkali metal species could occur at lower temperature region synergistically with devolatilisation olsson et al 1997 where metal could interact with organic polymers and facilitate depolymerization process like ring opening and scission of side groups saddawi et al 2012 the detailed catalytic mechanisms of aaem species during sludge devolatilisation deserve a further investigation 4 3 gs is more molecularly rigid than fs decomposition of larger amount of organics at higher temperatures in gs indicates that gs is more thermally stable compared with fs a high thermal stability normally relates to strong chemical bonds within certain compositions liu et al 2016 it has been found that the shortened hydrogen bonding distance between different amino acids is responsible for the improved thermal stability of the bacterium clostridium thermocellum anbar et al 2012 moreover the high decomposition temperatures of certain pseudo components of sludge are associated with their large molecular weights for instance higher decomposition temperatures were required for digested sludge due to the depletion of labile organic matter after anaerobic digestion li et al 2017a b analogously the higher temperatures required for the decomposition of chemical linkages in gs implies a more compact molecular organization on the other hand the lower activation energy value obtained for gs seemed to contradict its higher thermal stability and enrichment of refractory organics similar results were reported by ma et al 2019 showing a higher decomposition temperature of sewage sludge with a lower activation energy after hydrothermal pretreatment other than the possibility of catalytic effects of aaem species as discussed above it should be noted that thermal stability is not only governed by activation energy pre exponential factor and reaction mechanism also affect the sensitivity of a sample to temperature the low pre exponential factor often indicates a tight complex with few reaction sites while the high pre exponential factor indicates a loose complex with abundant reaction sites given the lower surface area of gs than fs fig s5 fewer reaction sites in gs exposed to elevated temperature is likely another reason for the lower sensitivity of gs to temperature than fs the reaction mechanism of all pseudo components followed nth order mechanisms except for pseudo component a2 in gs whose decomposition was better described by random nucleation and growth indeed melting of polymers took place ahead of depolymerization and most polymers thermally degraded in the liquid state where nth order mechanisms should apply vyazovkin 2015 however at low temperature high thermal stability and molecular rigidity of gs restricted the melting of organic polymer the decomposition of pseudo component a2 might behave like crystals requiring the heterogeneous nucleation of the volatile wang et al 2006 5 conclusion the pyrolysis of gs and fs was investigated in this study tg dtg analysis revealed that the devolatilisation stage of fs and gs could be described by three parallel reactions with three major pseudo components gs was proven to be more thermally stable than fs and the decomposition behaviors of pseudo components in two forms of sludge varied with different kinetics parameters the apparent activation energy of the decomposition of gs was calculated by isoconversional methods to be lower than that of fs most likely due to the catalytic effect of more alkaline minerals present in gs master plots of experimental data sets suggested that the decomposition of all organic pseudo components of fs followed the nth order mechanism while the pyrolytic mechanism of the first organic fraction in gs coincided with random nucleation and nuclei growth declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

18661,coupling anaerobic digestion and algae cultivation has attracted attention as a sustainable means of treating high strength wastewaters in such a scenario nutrients from the liquid anaerobic digestate are used by algae to produce biomass however use of full strength digestate results in poor algal growth and nutrient removal most researchers have overcome this challenge by diluting digestate 10 30 fold prior to algae growth but such dilution rates demand large amounts of fresh water posing challenges for scale up the objectives of this study were to 1 assess whether ammonium turbidity and heavy metals in digestate were the primary sources of inhibition for a highly nutrient tolerant strain of chlorella sorokiniana and 2 develop a biological pretreatment strategy to overcome algal growth inhibition on full strength digestate ammonia toxicity turbidity and heavy metals have been commonly hypothesized as the source of algal growth inhibition but our results showed that these factors were not critical inhibitors of c sorokiniana dose response studies showed that c sorokiniana could grow robustly on 3 500 mg l ammonium regardless full strength digestates of wastewater sludge and food waste were very inhibitory to c sorokiniana we utilized a pretreatment approach using activated sludge which led to robust algal growth on full strength digestate high growth rates of 250 500 mg l d were achievable on pretreated digestates despite very high ammonium levels of 2 000 mg l pretreating digestate also led to significantly faster algal nutrient uptake compared to untreated digestate p 0 001 graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestate inhibition algae activated sludge pretreatment 1 introduction with increasingly stringent nutrient discharge standards municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps and industrial wastewater generators are seeking innovative nutrient removal technologies utilization of algae in wastewater treatment has gained attention for its ability to remove and recover nutrients in their fixed form mostly as amino acids cai et al 2013 use of algae also reduces greenhouse gas emissions through co2 sequestration and the resulting algal biomass has a variety of beneficial uses spolaore et al 2006 there are increasing numbers of municipal and industrial treatment systems that employ anaerobic digestion to convert organic matter and bacteria biomass e g excess sludge from aeration tanks into biogas and digestate the liquid digestate ld fraction is rich in nutrients which can lead to environmental nutrient pollution if not adequately treated municipal wwtps typically reintroduce the ld back into the headworks of the treatment plant personal communication william kent manager of environmental services columbus water works creating a parasitic load on the system the elevated nutrient concentration not only puts a burden on downstream tertiary treatment but also potentially impacts the efficiency of downstream secondary treatment and anaerobic digestion chen et al 2008 a variety of algal species are known to quickly assimilate inorganic nutrients franchino et al 2016 and algae have been studied for nutrient recovery from a variety of anaerobic digestates ruiz martinez et al 2012 wang et al 2010 in fact digestates are rich in the nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients that typically limit algal growth in nature stanley et al 1990 however most researchers have found that full strength digestates severely inhibit algal growth cho et al 2013 franchino et al 2016 a finding that was common across a wide range of digestate types in these cases dilution rates of 10 30 fold were typically used to alleviate inhibition of ld in lab scale experiments cho et al 2013 franchino et al 2016 however diluting ld with freshwater is a non starter in water scarce regions and may even be suboptimal given the simultaneous dilution of nutrients needed for algal growth we hypothesize that removal or transformation of inhibitory compounds in ld will lead to rapid algal growth rates without the need for dilution water knowledge regarding specific inhibitors in ld is limited most studies cite ammonia cho et al 2013 turbidity wang et al 2010 and heavy metals wong et al 1994 as the primary sources of algal inhibition on ld a few others have mentioned unknown organic constituents and cod as potential inhibitors of algae franchino et al 2016 tigini et al 2016 the objectives of this research were to 1 assess whether ammonium turbidity and heavy metals in digestate were the primary sources of inhibition for a highly nutrient tolerant strain of chlorella sorokiniana and 2 test the effectiveness of aerobic activated sludge pretreatment of digestate as a means of reducing inhibitor concentrations in full strength anaerobic digestates 2 material and methods 2 1 anaerobic digestate and activated sludge collection municipal anaerobic digestate mad was collected from a mesophilic anaerobic digestor at the south columbus water resources facility columbus ga usa which is used to treat excess wastewater sludge and waste cooking oil activated sludge as was collected from an aerated activated sludge tank used for secondary wastewater treatment at the same facility both mad and as were immediately transported back to the lab and stored in a cold room 4 c until use food waste anaerobic digestate fwad was collected from a commercial scale high solids anaerobic digester at uc davis davis ca usa and was shipped to the lab overnight on ice and was stored in a freezer 80 c until use ld was prepared by a combination of centrifugation and filtration to remove solid components from the digestate as follows the upper liquid portion of the anaerobic digestate both mad and fwad was centrifuged at 4 696 x g for 30 min the supernatant was then passed through a series of filters of the following sizes using a vacuum filtration apparatus whatman no 4 filter

resulting liquid was termed clarified digestate sterile filtered digestate was later prepared by passing clarified digestate through advantec mixed cellulose ester membranes 0 45 μm and 0 2 μm and a 0 2 μm sterile filtration apparatus vwr pes filter filtration was used to control turbidity and to isolate treatment effects of algae without the assistance of wastewater bacteria 2 2 algae culture experimental plan the first experiments tested chlorella sorokiniana utex 2805 on different dilutions of mad and fwad to determine the extent of inhibition this strain of c sorokiniana was originally isolated from a wastewater treatment plant de bashan et al 2008 and has successfully been used in treatment of winery wastewater higgins et al 2017 given the frequently cited hypothesis that ammonia is the most important inhibitor in digestate we next cultured c sorokiniana on different concentrations of ammonium chloride in chemical n8 nh4 medium higgins and vandergheynst 2014 the ph of this medium was adjusted to 7 5 next c sorokiniana was cultivated in as pretreated ld treatment 1 and non treated ld treatment 2 in bubble column bioreactors wang et al 2019 to study algal growth and inhibition this experiment was carried out for both types of anaerobic digestate mad and fwad specific culture methods for as pretreatment and algae cultivation are described in subsequent sections control cultures were cultivated in defined chemical n8 medium tanadul et al 2014 because as pretreatment resulted in decreases in the ammonium concentration a third treatment group was tested with addition of ammonium chloride to restore the ammonium level to that of the untreated ld the purpose of this third treatment was to confirm if ammonium removal during as pretreatment had a meaningful impact on algal growth inhibition all experimental treatments and controls were tested in biological triplicate all ld was sterile filtered and supplemented with micronutrients and magnesium same final concentration as in the control chemical medium to ensure trace metals were not limiting growth 2 3 activated sludge pretreatment of anaerobic digestate clarified digestate passed through a 0 7 μm filter was treated with activated sludge by adding 2 v v activated sludge slurry 0 67 solids content to digestate ph of the digestate was adjusted to 7 5 with 3m hcl and aerated with 1 vvm air for 4 5 days the as treated anaerobic digestate was then sterile filtered through a vwr 0 2 μm sterile pes vacuum filtration unit for use in the algae cultivation test 2 4 algae cultivation method the algae cultivation method has been described previously higgins and vandergheynst 2014 higgins et al 2018a 2018b wang et al 2019 briefly c sorokiniana was initially cultured on a modified bold 3n agar plate for 5 7 days to isolate single colonies colonies were selected and used to grow 1 l stock cultures in n8 medium under a fluorescent light bank and aeration 0 5 vvm 2 co2 until the optical density 550 nm reached 0 2 0 3 stock cultures were then settled for 24 48 h at room temperature after removal of 90 of the supernatant the concentrated algae slurry was evenly transferred into each bioreactor to inoculate the experiment algae were grown in bubble column bioreactors over 5 days with light 170 μmol photons m2 s on a 14 h 10 h light dark cycle at 25 c bioreactors were aerated at 0 5 vvm and air was supplemented with 2 co2 ph was controlled at 7 5 for all cultures using either 3m hcl or 3m naoh daily samples 2 ml were taken from each bioreactor for optical density od measurement at 550 nm and 680 nm the samples were then centrifuged and the supernatant filtered through 0 2 μm syringe filters and stored at 80 c until further analysis 2 5 heavy metal analysis inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes spectro ciros icp spectro analytical instruments kleve germany was used to analyze the metal concentrations in the anaerobic digestate the digestate was first filtered through whatman no 42 filters and then 5 ml of filtered samples were digested with 1 1 v v nitric acid in a microwave digestion system as described previously chaump et al 2018 digested samples were analyzed via icp oes for metals cu mn al ca zn and fe 2 6 chemical oxygen demand cod and total nitrogen tests a hach dr900 was used to measure the soluble cod concentration in the sterile filtered digestates 5x diluted in di water a hach total nitrogen assay was also used to measure the nitrogen content of harvested algae cells following a previously published procedure higgins et al 2015 nitrogen content was multiplied by growth rate to determine the rate of nitrogen assimilation into algal cells 2 7 optical density and spectrum absorbance a spectramax m2 plate reader was used for od and spectrum absorbance measurements od was measured in triplicates for each sample at 550 nm and 680 nm spectrum absorbance was conducted on membrane filtered ld 0 2 μm from 200 nm to 1 000 nm in 10 nm increments in order to assess interference of ld absorbance with chlorophyll absorbance pigment and lipid extracts from c sorokiniana were analyzed as a point of reference when assessing absorption interference by digestate c sorokiniana extracts were obtained using a previously published modified folch method folch et al 1956 wang et al 2019 2 8 ion chromatography for nutrients analysis a prominence liquid chromatography lc system coupled with a conductivity detector shimadzu japan was used to analyze ion concentrations sodium potassium ammonium calcium magnesium chloride nitrite nitrate phosphate and sulfate in digestate samples based on a previously published method chaump et al 2018 briefly a dionex ionpac cs12 column 4 250mm thermo science and a dionex ionpac as22 column 4 250mm with suppression dionex cers 500 4 mm and dionex aers 500 4 mm respectively were used for ion separation acidic eluent 20 mm methanesulfonic acid was used on the cs12 column and basic eluent 4 5 mm sodium carbonate and 1 4 mm sodium bicarbonate solution was used on the as22 column 2 9 data analysis and statistics experiments were all conducted in biological triplicate except where noted statistical analyses anova and turkey s hsd test were carried out in r with the car package and agricolae package standard deviations were calculated in microsoft excel 3 results 3 1 algal inhibition in anaerobic digestate the growth of c sorokiniana was severely inhibited in both municipal sludge and food waste anaerobic digestates fig 1 diluting digestates with deionized water helped alleviate some inhibition with a 16x dilution of mad yielding 1 5 g l dry algal mass however the defined algal growth medium n8 yielded the highest overall growth at 2 1 g l dry mass after the 5 day cultivation period in full strength mad c sorokiniana did not have a detectable biomass increase until the last day of cultivation algal growth in diluted mad had a relatively faster growth rate than the chemical medium in the first 48 72 h but they reached an early growth ceiling suggesting potential nutrient limitation at high dilutions despite supplementation with micronutrients the most diluted mad 16x had the highest algal growth rate in this experiment similar trends were observed when cultivating c sorokiniana in fwad except algae cells experienced complete inhibition in both full strength and 2x diluted fwad the growth ceiling was also higher in dilutions of fwad compared to mad 3 2 ammonium tolerance test on c sorokiniana anoxic conditions and nitrogen rich organic feed material provide a suitable environment for ammonium production in anaerobic digestors most anaerobic digestate contains a large amount of ammonium ranging from 100 to 3 000 mg l in the liquid fraction xia and murphy 2016 the syringe filtered mad contained approximately 2 000 mg l of ammonium and the syringe filtered fwad had approximately 3 000 mg l of ammonium although ammonium is an important nitrogen source for algal growth excess ammonium combined with high ph can lead to high free ammonia concentrations free ammonia is typically harmful for algal growth gutierrez et al 2016 but can be partly controlled through ph we therefore tested the tolerance of c sorokiniana to high ammonium concentrations while controlling ph at 7 5 an ammonium dose response test on c sorokiniana revealed it to be highly tolerant to extreme ammonium concentrations up to 3 500 mg l fig 2 little difference in algal growth was observed on media containing ammonium concentrations ranging from 1

known for several decades wong et al 1994 these metals could have resulted in algal growth inhibition on digestates however the icp measurement of metals in mad and fwad table 1 showed that concentrations of copper aluminum and manganese in the digestates were lower than those in the defined chemical algal medium n8 in addition the high turbidity of raw mad and raw fwad should inhibit algal photosynthesis by reducing light penetration however filtration through 0 2 μm membranes greatly alleviated the turbidity for both mad and fwad fig s1 the spectrum absorption fig s2 also indicated that the filtered mad did not have strong absorbance at 350 500 and 630 680 nm which are key bands of chlorophyll a absorbance the filtered fwad had elevated absorbance below 400 nm but it only partially blocked the useful spectrum for photosynthesis 3 4 pretreating anaerobic digestate with activated sludge as 3 4 1 anaerobic digestate nutrient composition the change in anaerobic digestate nutrient composition before and after as pretreatment is shown in table s1 there was approximately 1 300 mg l cod in mad before and after as treatment however a significant decrease p 0 01 followed by an increase in soluble cod was observed during the as treatment process fig s3 this suggests removal of organics followed by degradation of recalcitrant material and release of soluble metabolites by as bacteria ammonium concentration in mad decreased from approximately 2 000 mg l to 1 100 mg l increases in soluble phosphate and sulfate were observed during the as treatment process for mad indicating solubilization under the aerobic conditions nitrate and nitrite were not detected during the process similar changes were observed in fwad during the as treatment process cod and ammonium decreased whereas chloride increased due to ph adjustment all other ions were relatively constant the ammonium concentration was originally 3 200 mg l and it decreased to roughly 2 000 mg l

al 2015 as activated sludge is known to harbor nitrifying organisms it was surprising that as pretreatment did not lead to any detectable increase in the nitrate concentration this led us to hypothesize that nitrifying organisms were also inhibited in the full strength digestates we carried out a test on full strength and 10x diluted mad fig s4 nitrification was suppressed in full strength mad with both nitrate and nitrite concentrations remaining undetectable during the as pretreatment process however significant nitrification was observed during as treatment of 10x diluted

pretreated anaerobic digestate 3 5 1 algal growth as pretreatment greatly alleviated the inhibitory effects of full strength mad on algae fig 3 a culturing c sorokiniana on as pretreated mad resulted in 3 5 times faster growth 532 mg l day over a 5 day average than the culture in untreated mad 150 mg l day and 1 4 times faster than the control culture the addition of ammonium to as pretreated mad to compensate for ammonium lost during the pretreatment process only had a negligible impact on algal growth 516 mg l day compared to the as pretreated mad we also experimented with simultaneous co treatment of digestate using as and algae the result was continued inhibition of algal growth fig s5 as pretreatment of fwad resulted in partial alleviation of algal growth inhibition fig 3b pretreatment of fwad with as resulted in a decline in ammonium content from 3100 mg l to 2000 mg l out of concern that such a high ammonium level could have a negative interactive effect with other inhibitors we diluted untreated fwad by a factor of 1 4 to reduce the ammonium concentration to the same level as as pretreated fwad 2 000 mg l ammonium we also added a third group of reactors in which we diluted pretreated digestate by 1 4 fold and then supplemented it with ammonium chloride to restore the ammonium level to 2 000 mg l this treatment was included to control for the dilution benefit afforded to the untreated digestate although the highest average growth rate 318 5 mg l day was still observed in the control n8 medium there was strong cell growth in the diluted as pretreated fwad and moderate growth in the full strength as pretreated fwad the untreated fwad completely inhibited algal growth even with the 1 4 fold dilution consistent with the previous dose response experiment 3 5 2 nutrient removal with the alleviation of algal growth inhibition by as pretreatment of anaerobic digestate there was also a significant increase in nitrogen assimilation into algal biomass increased assimilation of nitrogen was observed in both mad and fwad fig 4 after pretreatment measurements of nitrogen assimilation were used rather than measurements of nitrogen removal in order to understand algae s contribution to removal as opposed to other means such as volatilization over 40 mg l day nitrogen removal was observed when culturing algae in as pretreated mad with or without exogenous ammonium addition this was significantly higher than the algal nitrogen assimilation rate in untreated mad which was 10 mg l day p 0 001 significantly higher nitrogen assimilation p 0 001 was also observed in as pretreated fwad 10 mg l day compared to nitrogen assimilation in untreated fwad 3 mg l day the untreated fwad ended with a negative nitrogen assimilation due to net cell death in these cultures phosphate removal was likewise faster in the as pretreated anaerobic digestates compared to the untreated digestate fig 5 around 15 mg l day phosphate removal was observed in mad compared to a net negative phosphate removal release of phosphate into the media in untreated mad similar observations were found when growing algae in fwad algae did not remove a significant amount of phosphate from the untreated fwad p 0 718 on the other hand algae removed all of the phosphate in the 1 4 fold diluted as pretreated fwad averaging a phosphate removal rate of 10 mg l day moreover positive phosphate removal 5 mg l day was also observed in full strength as pretreated fwad 4 discussion the results obtained through our experiments suggest that the most commonly cited factors for algal growth inhibition on digestate namely ammonia cho et al 2013 turbidity wang et al 2010 and heavy metals wong et al 1994 do not provide a complete picture of algal inhibitors present in digestate high ammonium concentrations are likely to be inhibitory to a range of algae species however ammonium does not appear to be a significant problem for nutrient tolerant species of the genera chlorella and scenedesmus ayre et al 2017 so long as ph is controlled the chlorella species in this study grew robustly even at ammonium concentrations of 3 500 mg l heavy metals including aluminum and copper which are known to inhibit algae wong et al 1994 had lower concentrations in the two digestates than in chemical growth medium hence these metals cannot explain algal inhibition on digestate finally the use of filtration can largely alleviate the problem of digestate turbidity another inhibitor of algal growth filtration is already widely used in wastewater treatment processes for separation of solids and liquids for example the wastewater treatment plant that supplied the municipal anaerobic digestate in this study employs a belt press filter to separate digestate solids and liquid nevertheless we observed strong growth inhibition in c sorokiniana in both digestate types this inhibition could be partially or in the case of municipal digestate fully alleviated through pretreatment with an aerobic bacterial consortium this finding suggests that organic constituents are likely inhibitors of algal growth in the digestates studied indeed franchino et al 2016 have suggested that unknown organic constituents may contribute to inhibition tigini et al 2016 have also cited cod in digestate as an inhibitor of algae in past work we have found that volatile fatty acids vfas particularly propionic and butyric acid that are sometimes present in anaerobic digestate significantly inhibit algae wang et al 2018 those studies revealed ec50 concentrations of propionate and butyrate of roughly 450 mg l wang et al 2018 which are within the ranges found in many digestates from commercial scale operations franke whittle et al 2014 however the digestates used in the present study did not contain detectable vfas making this an unlikely explanation for inhibition observed in the present study many digestates also contain long chain free fatty acids as a result of lipid hydrolysis alves et al 2009 sousa et al 2013 and these are known to be lethal to certain algae including chlorella wu et al 2006 lipids are present in food waste and large volumes of waste cooking oil are processed in the anaerobic digester at the municipal wastewater treatment plant thus free fatty acids even at low concentrations could contribute to algal inhibition a range of phenolic compounds are also present in digestates hecht and griehl 2009 hernandez and edyvean 2008 and many algal species have been shown to be severely inhibited by a wide range of phenolics nakai et al 2001 pillinger et al 1994 wang et al 2016 however clear links between specific phenolics found in digestates and algal inhibition are the subject of ongoing investigations it is possible that organic constituents interact with ammonium to suppress algal growth however our results show that removal of inhibitory constituents by aerobic bacteria alleviates inhibition even at very high ammonium concentrations e g 2 000 mg l praveen et al 2018 also utilized aerobic bacteria to pretreat anaerobic digestate prior to algae growth and found that this approach reduced inhibition however they largely attributed this effect to nitrification of ammonium which they assumed to be the primary inhibitor during treatment of digestate with activated sludge there were indeed reductions in ammonium however no concomitant increase in nitrite or nitrate was observed suggesting little to no ammonium oxidation during pretreatment instead much of the ammonium loss was likely due to ammonia volatilization our results showed that full strength digestate completely inhibited ammonium oxidizing organisms ten fold dilution of the digestate allowed for a resumption of ammonium oxidation and production of nitrate however observation of significant nitrite production also indicates continued partial inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria indeed praveen et al 2018 used dilution rates of 10 fold for all of their inhibition studies which likely explains their observation of nitrification it is interesting to note that algae but not nitrifying bacteria could process ammonium in full strength digestate underscoring the potential niche that hyper eutrophic algae can play in treatment of high strength wastewaters there are several major problems that make the dilution approach impractical for advancing algae treatment of anaerobic digestate first freshwater is a scarce and valuable resource particularly for agricultural and industrial wastewater generators who may lack access to large quantities of dilution water second critical nutrients needed for algal growth are diluted at the same rate as the inhibitors leading to sub optimal algal growth rates and nutrient removal as we observed in digestate dosing studies it was interesting that dilution led to slightly faster initial algal growth rates than the chemical control medium however this effect was likely due to the presence of ammonium in the digestate versus nitrate in the control medium c sorokiniana preferentially consumes ammonium over nitrate ogbonna et al 2000 and our results indicate that growth on ammonium fig 2 was faster than that on nitrate medium fig 1 moreover dilution led to a lower plateau in growth indicative of nutrient limitation despite supplementation with a micronutrient solution finally sub optimal growth rates necessitate a large reactor volume for algal growth this leads to greater cost and thus lower likelihood of technology adoption a better approach is to remove or destroy the inhibitors present in the digestate thus allowing rapid algal growth on full strength digestate fast growing algae in turn remove nutrients more quickly shrinking the footprint and cost of the required treatment facility that said our results suggest that aerobic bacterial treatment does not always fully remove inhibitors in the digestate as was the case with fwad in such cases mild dilution can be helpful in maximizing algal growth and nutrient removal rates the pretreatment approach discussed here would benefit from additional process optimization moreover given the very high nutrient levels in digestate a multi stage algal treatment system is likely required in order to reduce nutrient concentrations to levels acceptable for environmental discharge 5 conclusions 1 severe algal inhibition was observed on high strength ld but the main source of inhibition was not due to the commonly cited reasons of ammonium toxicity turbidity or heavy metal toxicity 2 using aerobic bacteria as a pretreatment step effectively alleviated algal inhibition and increased nutrient removal rates pretreatment was more effective with municipal sludge digestate than with food waste digestate 3 organic compounds in ld are likely to be important algal inhibitors and the pretreatment process led to initial reduction in digestate cod levels declaration of interests the authors

18661,coupling anaerobic digestion and algae cultivation has attracted attention as a sustainable means of treating high strength wastewaters in such a scenario nutrients from the liquid anaerobic digestate are used by algae to produce biomass however use of full strength digestate results in poor algal growth and nutrient removal most researchers have overcome this challenge by diluting digestate 10 30 fold prior to algae growth but such dilution rates demand large amounts of fresh water posing challenges for scale up the objectives of this study were to 1 assess whether ammonium turbidity and heavy metals in digestate were the primary sources of inhibition for a highly nutrient tolerant strain of chlorella sorokiniana and 2 develop a biological pretreatment strategy to overcome algal growth inhibition on full strength digestate ammonia toxicity turbidity and heavy metals have been commonly hypothesized as the source of algal growth inhibition but our results showed that these factors were not critical inhibitors of c sorokiniana dose response studies showed that c sorokiniana could grow robustly on 3 500 mg l ammonium regardless full strength digestates of wastewater sludge and food waste were very inhibitory to c sorokiniana we utilized a pretreatment approach using activated sludge which led to robust algal growth on full strength digestate high growth rates of 250 500 mg l d were achievable on pretreated digestates despite very high ammonium levels of 2 000 mg l pretreating digestate also led to significantly faster algal nutrient uptake

environmental services columbus water works creating a parasitic load on the system the elevated nutrient concentration not only puts a burden on downstream tertiary treatment but also potentially impacts the efficiency of downstream secondary treatment and anaerobic digestion chen et al 2008 a variety of algal species are known to quickly assimilate inorganic nutrients franchino et al 2016 and algae have been studied for nutrient recovery from a variety of anaerobic digestates ruiz martinez et al 2012 wang et al 2010 in fact digestates are rich in the nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients that typically limit algal growth in nature stanley et al 1990 however most researchers have found that full strength digestates severely inhibit algal growth cho et al 2013 franchino et al 2016 a finding that was common across a wide range of digestate types in these cases dilution rates of 10 30 fold were typically used to alleviate inhibition of ld in lab scale experiments cho et al 2013 franchino et al 2016 however diluting ld with freshwater is a non starter in water scarce regions and may even be suboptimal given the simultaneous dilution of nutrients needed for algal growth we hypothesize that removal or transformation of inhibitory compounds in ld will lead to rapid algal growth rates without the need for dilution water knowledge regarding specific inhibitors in ld is limited most studies cite ammonia cho et al 2013 turbidity wang et al 2010 and heavy metals wong et al 1994 as the primary sources of algal inhibition on ld a few others have mentioned unknown organic constituents and cod as potential inhibitors of algae franchino et al 2016 tigini et al 2016 the objectives of this research were to 1 assess whether ammonium turbidity and heavy metals in digestate were the primary sources of inhibition for a highly nutrient tolerant strain of chlorella sorokiniana and 2 test the effectiveness of aerobic activated sludge pretreatment of digestate as a means of reducing inhibitor concentrations in full strength anaerobic digestates 2 material and methods 2 1 anaerobic digestate and activated sludge collection municipal anaerobic digestate mad was collected from a mesophilic anaerobic digestor at the south columbus water resources facility columbus ga usa which is used to treat excess wastewater sludge and waste cooking oil activated sludge as was collected from an aerated activated sludge tank used for secondary wastewater treatment at the same facility both mad and as were immediately transported back to the lab and stored in a cold room 4 c until use food waste anaerobic digestate fwad was collected from a commercial scale high solids anaerobic digester at uc davis davis ca usa and was shipped to the lab overnight on ice and was stored in a freezer 80 c until use ld was prepared by a combination of centrifugation and filtration to remove solid components from the digestate as follows the upper liquid portion of the anaerobic digestate both mad and fwad was centrifuged at 4 696 x g for 30 min the supernatant was then passed through a series of filters of the following sizes using a vacuum filtration apparatus whatman no 4 filter

resulting liquid was termed clarified digestate sterile filtered digestate was later prepared by passing clarified digestate through advantec mixed cellulose ester membranes 0 45 μm and 0 2 μm and a 0 2 μm sterile filtration apparatus vwr pes filter filtration was used to control turbidity and to isolate treatment effects of algae without the assistance of wastewater bacteria 2 2 algae culture experimental plan the first experiments tested chlorella sorokiniana utex 2805 on different dilutions of mad and fwad to determine the extent of inhibition this strain of c sorokiniana was originally isolated from a wastewater treatment plant de bashan et al 2008 and has successfully been used in treatment of winery wastewater higgins et al 2017 given the frequently cited hypothesis that ammonia is the most important inhibitor in digestate we next cultured c sorokiniana on different concentrations of ammonium chloride in chemical n8 nh4 medium higgins and vandergheynst 2014 the ph of this medium was adjusted to 7 5 next c sorokiniana was cultivated in as pretreated ld treatment 1 and non treated ld treatment 2 in bubble column bioreactors wang et al 2019 to study algal growth and inhibition this experiment was carried out for both types of anaerobic digestate mad and fwad specific culture methods for as pretreatment and algae cultivation are described in subsequent sections control cultures were cultivated in defined chemical n8 medium tanadul et al 2014 because as pretreatment resulted in decreases in the ammonium concentration a third treatment group was tested with addition of ammonium chloride to restore the ammonium level to that of the untreated ld the purpose of this third treatment was to confirm if ammonium removal during as pretreatment had a meaningful impact on algal growth inhibition all experimental treatments and controls were tested in biological triplicate all ld was sterile filtered and supplemented with micronutrients and magnesium same final concentration as in the control chemical medium to ensure trace metals were not limiting growth 2 3 activated sludge pretreatment of anaerobic digestate clarified digestate passed through a 0 7 μm filter was treated with activated sludge by adding 2 v v activated sludge slurry 0 67 solids content to digestate ph of the digestate was adjusted to 7 5 with 3m hcl and aerated with 1 vvm air for 4 5 days the as treated anaerobic digestate was then sterile filtered through a vwr 0 2 μm sterile pes vacuum filtration unit for use in the algae cultivation test 2 4 algae cultivation method the algae cultivation method has been described previously higgins and vandergheynst 2014 higgins et al 2018a 2018b wang et al 2019 briefly c sorokiniana was initially cultured on a modified bold 3n agar plate for 5 7 days to isolate single colonies colonies were selected and used to grow 1 l stock cultures in n8 medium under a fluorescent light bank and aeration 0 5 vvm 2 co2 until the optical density 550 nm reached 0 2 0 3 stock cultures were then settled for 24 48 h at room temperature after removal of 90 of the supernatant the concentrated algae slurry was evenly transferred into each bioreactor to inoculate the experiment algae were grown in bubble column bioreactors over 5 days with light 170 μmol photons m2 s on a 14 h 10 h light dark cycle at 25 c bioreactors were aerated at 0 5 vvm and air was supplemented with 2 co2 ph was controlled at 7 5 for all cultures using either 3m hcl or 3m naoh daily samples 2 ml were taken from each bioreactor for optical density od measurement at 550 nm and 680 nm the samples were then centrifuged and the supernatant filtered through 0 2 μm syringe filters and stored at 80 c until further analysis 2 5 heavy metal analysis inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes spectro ciros icp spectro analytical instruments kleve germany was used to analyze the metal concentrations in the anaerobic digestate the digestate was first filtered through whatman no 42 filters and then 5 ml of filtered samples were digested with 1 1 v v nitric acid in a microwave digestion system as described previously chaump et al 2018 digested samples were analyzed via icp oes for metals cu mn al ca zn and fe 2 6 chemical oxygen demand cod and total nitrogen tests a hach dr900 was used to measure the soluble cod concentration in the sterile filtered digestates 5x diluted in di water a hach total nitrogen assay was also used to measure the nitrogen content of harvested algae cells following a previously published procedure higgins et al 2015 nitrogen content was multiplied by growth rate to determine the rate of nitrogen assimilation into algal cells 2 7 optical density and spectrum absorbance a spectramax m2 plate reader was used for od and spectrum absorbance measurements od was measured in triplicates for each sample at 550 nm and 680 nm spectrum absorbance was conducted on membrane filtered ld 0 2 μm from 200 nm to 1 000 nm in 10 nm increments in order to assess interference of ld absorbance with chlorophyll absorbance pigment and lipid extracts from c sorokiniana were analyzed as a point of reference when assessing absorption interference by digestate c sorokiniana extracts were obtained using a previously published modified folch method folch et al 1956 wang et al 2019 2 8 ion chromatography for nutrients analysis a prominence liquid chromatography lc system coupled with a conductivity detector shimadzu japan was used to analyze ion concentrations sodium potassium ammonium calcium magnesium chloride nitrite nitrate phosphate and sulfate in digestate samples based on a previously published method chaump et al 2018 briefly a dionex ionpac cs12 column 4 250mm thermo science and a dionex ionpac as22 column 4 250mm with suppression dionex cers 500 4 mm and dionex aers 500 4 mm respectively were used for ion separation acidic eluent 20 mm methanesulfonic acid was used on the cs12 column and basic eluent 4 5 mm sodium carbonate and 1 4 mm sodium bicarbonate solution was used on the as22 column 2 9 data analysis and statistics experiments were all conducted in biological triplicate except where noted statistical analyses anova and turkey s hsd test were carried out in r with the car package and agricolae package standard deviations were calculated in microsoft excel 3 results 3 1 algal inhibition in anaerobic digestate the growth of c sorokiniana was severely inhibited in both municipal sludge and food waste anaerobic digestates fig 1 diluting digestates with deionized water helped alleviate some inhibition with a 16x dilution of mad yielding 1 5 g l dry algal mass however the defined algal growth medium n8 yielded the highest overall growth at 2 1 g l dry mass after the 5 day cultivation period in full strength mad c sorokiniana did not have a detectable biomass increase until the last day of cultivation algal growth in diluted mad had a relatively faster growth rate than the chemical medium in the first 48 72 h but they reached an early growth ceiling suggesting potential nutrient limitation at high dilutions despite supplementation with micronutrients the most diluted mad 16x had the highest algal growth rate in this experiment similar trends were observed when cultivating c sorokiniana in fwad except algae cells experienced complete inhibition in both full strength and 2x diluted fwad the growth ceiling was also higher in dilutions of fwad compared to mad 3 2 ammonium tolerance test on c sorokiniana anoxic conditions and nitrogen rich organic feed material provide a suitable environment for ammonium production in anaerobic digestors most anaerobic digestate contains a large amount of ammonium ranging from 100 to 3 000 mg l in the liquid fraction xia and murphy 2016 the syringe filtered mad contained approximately 2 000 mg l of ammonium and the syringe filtered fwad had approximately 3 000 mg l of ammonium although ammonium is an important nitrogen source for algal growth excess ammonium combined with high ph can lead to high free ammonia concentrations free ammonia is typically harmful for algal growth gutierrez et al 2016 but can be partly controlled through ph we therefore tested the tolerance of c sorokiniana to high ammonium concentrations while controlling ph at 7 5 an ammonium dose response test on c sorokiniana revealed it to be highly tolerant to extreme ammonium concentrations up to 3 500 mg l fig 2 little difference in algal growth was observed on media containing ammonium concentrations ranging from 1 000 mg l to 3 500 mg l below 1 000 mg l ammonium algal growth decreased fig 2a 3 3 heavy metals and turbidity the inhibitory effects of certain metals such as copper aluminum and manganese have been known for several decades wong et al 1994 these metals could have resulted in algal growth inhibition on digestates however the icp measurement of metals in mad and fwad table 1 showed that concentrations of copper aluminum and manganese in the digestates were lower than those in the defined chemical algal medium n8 in addition the high turbidity of raw mad and raw fwad should inhibit algal photosynthesis by reducing light penetration however filtration through 0 2 μm membranes greatly alleviated the turbidity for both mad and fwad fig s1 the spectrum absorption fig s2 also indicated that the filtered mad did not have strong absorbance at 350 500 and 630 680 nm which are key bands of chlorophyll a absorbance the filtered fwad had elevated absorbance below 400 nm but it

result of lipid hydrolysis alves et al 2009 sousa et al 2013 and these are known to be lethal to certain algae including chlorella wu et al 2006 lipids are present in food waste and large volumes of waste cooking oil are processed in the anaerobic digester at the municipal wastewater treatment plant thus free fatty acids even at low concentrations could contribute to algal inhibition a range of phenolic compounds are also present in digestates hecht and griehl 2009 hernandez and edyvean 2008 and many algal species have been shown to be severely inhibited by a wide range of phenolics nakai et al 2001 pillinger et al 1994 wang et al 2016 however clear links between specific phenolics found in digestates and algal inhibition are the subject of ongoing investigations it is possible that organic constituents interact with ammonium to suppress algal growth however our results show that removal of inhibitory constituents by aerobic bacteria alleviates inhibition even at very high ammonium concentrations e g 2 000 mg l praveen et al 2018 also utilized aerobic bacteria to pretreat anaerobic digestate prior to algae growth and found that this approach reduced inhibition however they largely attributed this effect to nitrification of ammonium which they assumed to be the primary inhibitor during treatment of digestate with activated sludge there were indeed reductions in ammonium however no concomitant increase in nitrite or nitrate was observed suggesting little to no ammonium oxidation during pretreatment instead much of the ammonium loss was likely due to ammonia volatilization our results showed that full strength digestate completely inhibited ammonium oxidizing organisms ten fold dilution of the digestate allowed for a resumption of ammonium oxidation and production of nitrate however observation of significant nitrite production also indicates continued partial inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria indeed praveen et al 2018 used dilution rates of 10 fold for all of their inhibition studies which likely explains their observation of nitrification it is interesting to note that algae but not nitrifying bacteria could process ammonium in full strength digestate underscoring the potential niche that hyper eutrophic algae can play in treatment of high strength wastewaters there are several major problems that make the dilution approach impractical for advancing algae treatment of anaerobic digestate first freshwater is a scarce and valuable resource particularly for agricultural and industrial wastewater generators who may lack access to large quantities of dilution water second critical nutrients needed for algal growth are diluted at the same rate as the inhibitors leading to sub optimal algal growth rates and nutrient removal as we observed in digestate dosing studies it was interesting that dilution led to slightly faster initial algal growth rates than the chemical control medium however this effect was likely due to the presence of ammonium in the digestate versus nitrate in the control medium c sorokiniana preferentially consumes ammonium over nitrate ogbonna et al 2000 and our results indicate that growth on ammonium fig 2 was faster than that on nitrate medium fig 1 moreover dilution led to a lower plateau in growth indicative of nutrient limitation despite supplementation with a micronutrient solution finally sub optimal growth rates necessitate a large reactor volume for algal growth this leads to greater cost and thus lower likelihood of technology adoption a better approach is to remove or destroy the inhibitors present in the digestate thus allowing rapid algal growth on full strength digestate fast growing algae in turn remove nutrients more quickly shrinking the footprint and cost of the required treatment facility that said our results suggest that aerobic bacterial treatment does not always fully remove inhibitors in the digestate as was the case with fwad in such cases mild dilution can be helpful in maximizing algal growth and nutrient removal rates the pretreatment approach discussed here would benefit from additional process optimization moreover given the very high nutrient levels in digestate a multi stage algal treatment system is likely required in order to reduce nutrient concentrations to levels acceptable for environmental discharge 5 conclusions 1 severe algal inhibition was observed on high strength ld but the main source of inhibition was not due to the commonly cited reasons of ammonium toxicity turbidity or heavy metal toxicity 2 using aerobic bacteria as a pretreatment step effectively alleviated algal inhibition and increased nutrient removal rates pretreatment was more effective with municipal sludge digestate than with food waste digestate 3 organic compounds in ld are likely to be important algal inhibitors and the pretreatment process led to initial reduction in digestate cod levels declaration of interests the authors

18662,certain amino acids aas can form odorous aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines during chlorination ultraviolet uv photolysis ultraviolet persulfate uv ps and ultraviolet hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 treatments have been reported to decrease trace organic contaminants in drinking water in this study 20 common aas in east taihu et lake the main drinking water source for the surrounding cities were determined during one year four seasons the impacts of uv photolysis alone and two uv advanced oxidation process aop pre treatments on the formation of aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines during post chlorination of water containing three of the most detected aas i e valine val leucine leu and isoleucine ile in et lake were investigated results showed that the two uv aops significantly decreased the odorous by product formation from aas compared with uv photolysis alone the formation of n chloroaldimines was more easily controlled than that of aldehyde and nitrile furthermore uv h2o2 was more effective than uv ps at ph 5 and 7 at ph 9 the two uv aops had similar effects and did not perform very well in addition the uv aops controlled the formation of odorous by products effectively at cl aa molar ratio of chlorine to amino acid ratios of 2 4 and 3 0 but increased their formation at cl aa ratios of 0 8 and 1 2 experiments in real water showed that uv h2o2 was more suitable for controlling the off flavor problem caused by chlorination of aas in et lake graphical abstract image 1 keywords amino acids odorous by products aldehydes nitriles n chloroaldimines advanced oxidation technology 1 introduction taihu lake is the third largest freshwater lake in china and the water source for millions of people in several cities however quantities of nutrients have been introduced into taihu lake due to the random discharge of industrial wastewater agriculture run off and domestic sewage over the past few decades having made the lake severely eutrophic and cause algal blooms to occur guo 2007 li et al 2018 the metabolism and death of algae lead to high concentration of organic matter that can react with chlorine the most common disinfectant in drinking water treatment forming various disinfection by products dbps sedlak and von gunten 2011 some types of dbps are potentially genotoxic and carcinogenic richardson et al 2007 while other types are non harmful but lead to off flavor problems causing consumer to worry about the safety of drinking water zhang et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 amino acids aas are a type of organic contaminant metabolized by algae previous studies have indicated that chlorination of certain aas can produce odorous organic chloramines aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines r ch ncl freuze et al 2005 how et al 2017 among these odorous dbps aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines are stable and as shown in the supporting information si table si1 their odor perception thresholds are low at μg l level the concentrations of their aa precursors in drinking water sources range from 0 to 10 μg l in southern california chinn and barrett 2000 and from 0 to 30 μg l in several plants in western france berne et al 1994 as traditional drinking water treatment processes are ineffective at removing the low molecular weight aas before the chlorination step dotson and westerhoff 2009 the concentrations of the odorous by products formed from aas during chlorination may be high and cause serious odor problems thus it is necessary to take valid measures to control off flavor by product formation during chlorination of aas there have been few studies on the control of odorous by product formation from the chlorination of aa precursors according to the control of other dbps a promising method is to remove the precursors of these odorous byproducts prior to chlorination bond et al 2011 some studies have reported that ultraviolet uv treatment alone can degrade organic matter to compounds with lower molecular weight magnuson et al 2002 shah et al 2011 moreover uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops especially ultraviolet hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 and ultraviolet persulfate uv ps processes can efficiently degrade various trace organic contaminants dotson et al 2010 however whether these processes can decrease the formation of odorous by products produced from aas has not been reported thus the objective of this study was to investigate the influence of uv and uv aop pre treatments on the formation of odorous by products during post chlorination of aas and find the most effective process in this paper 20 kinds of common aas in east taihu et lake the major drinking water source for the surrounding cities were monitored for a whole year four seasons three of the most detected aas i e val leu and ile were chosen as representative odorous by product precursors the impacts of uv irradiation and two uv aop uv h2o2 and uv ps pre treatments on the formation of three odorous by products aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines from aas during subsequent chlorination were investigated the effects of uv intensity oxidant dosage ph and chlorine dosage on the pre treatment performance were also evaluated and the applications of these processes in real water from et lake were also conducted which aimed to select an effective process for controling the odor problems caused by chlorination of aas in et lake 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents all chemicals and solvents listed in table si2 were at least analytical reagent grade all solutions were prepared in millipore water without chlorine demand 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 water sampling algae cultivation and preparation for aa analysis raw water samples were collected from the wujiang drinking water treatment plant dwtp which uses the et lake as the water source the water quality characteristics of the water samples are listed in table 1 microcystis aeruginosa was obtained from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences cultivation and intracellular organic matter iom extraction were described in text si1 the aas in water samples and the iom of microcystis aeruginosa were enriched by solid phase extraction spe before analysis the details of spe preparation are listed in text si2 2 2 2 uv uv aop treatments and chlorination the irradiation experiments were conducted in a 1 6 l cylindrical photoreactor as displayed in fig si1 in the uv alone treatment experiments each aa val leu and ile model solution 50 ml 0 1 mm was added to a ground quartz test tube with plug respectively and irradiated for the designed time in the uv ps and uv h2o2 experiments calculated amounts of ps or h2o2 solution were dosed and stirred immediately before the test tubes were moved into the photoreactor the temperature in the photoreactor was 25 c 1 c the effect of ps or h2o2 pre oxidation alone was also investigated by adding the oxidant into aa solution without uv irradiation after pre treatment 10 ml of treated aa solution was transferred into a 20 ml brown headspace sample vial the 10 ml of treated aa solution was chlorinated by adding appropriate microvolumes of sodium hypochlorite solutions following thorough stirring for 20 s the solution was incubated in dark at room temperature for 3 h all reactions were conducted in buffer solutions and h2so4 and naoh were added for ph adjustment the experiments were all carried out at least twice and average values were used in the diagrams with error bars showing one standard deviation 2 3 chemical analysis solution ph was measured by a ph meter la ph10 hach usa doc and was determined by a toc analyzer shimadzu toc vcph japan the concentration of free chlorine was detected by a portable residual chlorine meter dr2800 hach usa the concentrations of 20 aas were determined by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms agilent usa after spe the measurement conditions and gradient elution conditions of hplc were listed in table si3 and table si4 respectively the ms was operated in electrospray ionization esi positive mode and multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode and the operating parameters were obtained from a study by how et al how et al 2018 the volatile odorous by products including corresponding aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines of val leu and ile were extracted by headspace solid phase micro extraction hs spme with a 75 μm car pdms spme fiber supelco usa and then measured by gas chromatograph mass spectrometry 5977 7890b agilent usa this method was modified from a prior study how et al 2017 and the details were described in text si3 and text si4 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of 20 kinds of aas in et lake the total aas and 20 kinds of common aas including tyrosine tyr tryptophan try threonine thr serine ser proline pro phe ornithine orn methionine met leu ile histidine his glycine gly glutamic acid glu glutamine gln aspartic acid asp asparagines asn arginine arg lysine lys val and alanine ala were determined in et lake during four seasons as shown in fig si2 the total aas content in et lake was 32158 ng l in autumn and approximately 3000 ng l in other seasons from fig 1 a d the concentrations of the 20 aas ranged from 0 to 9000 ng l and most aas reached maximums in autumn these results were similar to those of a prior study by brosillon et al who demonstrated that the concentrations of some aas in the raw water from three dwtps in paris were higher in autumn brosillon et al 2009 notably the contents of val leu ile and phe which have been reported to be odorous by product precursors how et al 2018 were 1727 ng l 2831 ng l 2653 ng l and 2873 ng l in autumn respectively and were approximately 100 300 ng l in other seasons hureiki et al illustrated that the aa content in water was relevant to the concentration of algae hureiki et al 1994 as the algal blooms in et lake mainly occurr in august and september annually the high level of aas in autumn may be related to the increased algae quantity to prove it iom of microcystis aeruginosa which is the dominant algae in et lake was analyzed from fig si3 the iom of microcystis aeruginosa contained many kinds of aas among which lys orn leu ile phe and val were presented at high levels particularly the latter four aas are odorous by products precursors how et al 2018 the concentrations of thr ser met gly gln asp and asn were low these results were highly similar to those obtained for et lake in autumn as shown in fig 1b thus the higher aa concentrations in et lake in autumn were plausibly caused by the algal blooms during this time the aas in the iom of algae were released when the algal cells ruptured the maximum quantities of odorous aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines formed were reported to be approximately 12 60 and 40 of the initial quantity of each aa precursor respectively when cl aa the molar ratio of chlorine to amino acid 2 freuze et al 2005 how et al 2017 considering the val leu and ile contents in et lake in autumn the concentrations of odorous n chloroaldimines and aldehydes formed will be 3 4 times higher and slightly higher than their odor perception thresholds table si1 respectively if the aa precursors cannot be better removed however traditional treatment processes cannot efficiently degrade the low molecular weight aas dotson and westerhoff 2009 thus additional pre treatment is needed to control the odorous by product formation from chlorination of aas in et lake 3 2 impact of uv pre treatment alone on odorous by product formation the impact of uv photolysis on the formation of aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines during subsequent chlorination of the selected aas were shown in fig si4a c uv irradiation alone with a medium pressure mp uv lamp reduced the formation of odorous by products during chlorination of val leu and ile although the effectiveness was not obvious unless the uv dosage was high under a uv dose of 37800 mj cm2 the formation of aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines from chlorination of the three selected aas were decreased by approximately 35 40 and 45 respectively from fig si5 the concentrations of aas were decreased after high dosage uv irradiation indicating that the mp uv lamp degraded the aa precursors freuze et al 2006 previous studies have indicated that the polychromatic output emitted by a mp uv lamp can degrade organic precursors into lower molecular weight products thus the formation of the corresponding dbps during chlorination would be impacted shah et al 2011 notably the formation of aldehydes from post chlorination of aas after uv photolysis was decreased to a less degree than that of nitriles and n chloroaldimines this difference may have occurred because uv irradiation degraded selected aas into some products with greater potential to form aldehydes in contrast the formation of n chloroaldimines was decreased the most this can be explained by the formation and degradation pathways displayed in fig 2 since the degradation of aas by uv pre treatment led to excess residual chlorine the oxidation of aldehyde by extra hocl into carboxylic acid iv viii was promoted indirectly resulting in more n chloroaldimine degradation into aldehyde to reach equilibrium vi iv how et al 2018 in summary only a high dosage of mp uv pre treatment can somewhat reduce the formation of the three odorous by products from the selected aas during subsequent chlorination 3 3 impacts of uv aop pre treatments on odorous by product formation the effects of ps and h2o2 pre oxidations alone were first investigated however from fig si6 the odorous by product formation during post chlorination of val leu and ile did not change significantly after either ps or h2o2 pre oxidation fig si7 indicated that neither ps nor h2o2 oxidation alone had an obvious effect on aas concentraions these results suggested that ps or h2o2 pre oxidation alone could not control odorous by product formation indicating uv photolysis was needed in all uv aop experiments the residuals of aas ps and h2o2 were undetected and the concentration of residual chlorine in control exiperiments with no pre treatment of val leu and ile were measured as 1 153 mg l 1 150 mg l and 1 158 mg l respectively fig 3 a f presented the effects of uv aop pre treatments on the formation of aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines from val a and b leu c and d and ile e and f during post chlorination under different oxidant dosages following uv ps pre oxidation the formation of aldehydes and nitriles from post chlorination of the selected aas were both decreased by approximately 10 15 83 and 95 at ps aa ratios of 1 5 and 10 respectively and the formation of n chloroaldimines were decreased by approximately 17 90 and 99 at ps aa ratios of 1 5 and 10 respectively in contrast the uv h2o2 pre treatment decreased the concentrations of both aldehydes and nitriles formed from post chlorination of the selected aas by nearly 16 18 88 and 99 at h2o2 aa ratios of 1 5 and 10 respectively the n chloroaldimine formation was decreased following uv h2o2 pre treatment by approximate 22 96 and 99 at h2o2 aa ratios of 1 5 and 10 respectively moreover the concentrations of aas listed in fig si7 decreased after uv aop pre treatments the results suggested that uv aop pre treatments decreased odorous by product formation and the effects improved as the oxidant dosages increased as eqs 1 and 2 show uv irradiation can cause ps and h2o2 to produce sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals respectively tan et al 2013 of note part of so4 would produce oh under neutral condition as shown in eq 3 gao et al 2012 the oxidation potentials of the sulfate radical e0 2 8 v and hydroxyl radical e0 2 9 v are very high both radicals can effectively decompose organic pollutants such as aas lamsal et al 2011 tan et al 2013 ying et al 2016 thus the odorous by product formation from the selected aas during subsequent chlorination was decreased moreover one way analysis of variance was conducted showing that uv h2o2 is more effective at reducing the formation of odorous by products than uv ps p 0 05 which may be because aa precursors are more easily degraded by uv h2o2 than by uv ps 1 s2o8 2 hv 2so4 2 h2o2 hv 2oh 3 so4 h2o so4 2 oh h notably after uv ps or uv h2o2 pre treatment the levels of aldehydes and nitriles from the subsequent chlorination were decreased by similar percentages under the same ps or h2o2 dosage which was different from the results observed for uv pre treatment alone this result may be because the two uv aops can oxidize aas more thoroughly thus no other aldehyde precursors were produced nevertheless the formation of n chloroaldimines was still reduced the most among the three odorous by products this was probably because the aas were more effectively decomposed by both uv aops than by uv pre treatment alone leading more chlorine to remain and react with aldehyde as described in 3 2 when more aldehyde was oxidized by hocl more n chloroaldimine decomposed into aldehydes to maintain equilibrium in summary the efficiency of decreasing the formation of odorous by products from the selected aas followed the order uv h2o2 uv ps uv 3 4 effect of ph 3 4 1 effect of ph on odorous by products formation during post chlorination without any pre treatment table 2 displayed the molar conversions of the selected aas to odorous by products during chlorination at different ph considering the actual ph of et lake ph 5 7 and 9 were applied as shown in fig 2 nitrile vii and n chloroaldimine vi are degradation products of n n dichloramine v and hcl is generated during the processes thus acidic conditions would suppress the decomposition of n n dichloramine v into nitrile vii and n chloroaldimine vi for this reason both nitrile and n chloroaldimine had lower production at ph 5 and their concentrations increased as ph increased nevertheless the formation of nitriles at ph 9 was nearly the same as that at ph 7 this may have been because a higher ph can also accelerate the hydrolysis of nitriles vii viii yu and reckhow 2015 aldehydes were reported to be produced mainly by the hydrolysis of n chloroaldimine vi iv at cl aa 2 how et al 2017 this process also produced nh2cl which had hydrolysis eqs 4 and 5 and disproportionation eq 6 reactions in water valentine and jafvert 1988 under acidic conditions the formed nh3 in hydrolysis reaction could react with h and the disproportionation of nh2cl was catalyzed by the hydrogen ion valentine and jafvert 1988 thus nh2cl was unstable under acidic conditions which promoted the hydrolysis of n chloroaldimine vi iv to reach an equilibrium moreover acidic conditions could suppress the reaction between extra hocl and aldehyde iv viii when cl aa 2 therefore more aldehydes formed at ph 5 than at higher ph surprisingly the yield of aldehyde at ph 9 increased slightly compared to that at ph 7 this may have been because alkaline conditions would promote the n monochloramino acid degradation into aldehyde ii iv although at cl aa 2 this process is not the dominate formation pathway of aldehyde and occurs only during a short time at the beginning of the reaction the rate constant of this reaction is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the n chloroaldimine hydrolysis reaction how et al 2017 4 nh2cl h2o nh3 hclo 5 nh2cl hclo nhcl2 h2o 6 nh2c1 nh2c1 nhc12 nh3 in summary more odorous by products would be formed from chlorination of aas under neutral and alkaline conditions thus operators are suggested to appropriately lower the ph of water before chlorination step 3 4 2 effect of ph on odorous by products formation during post chlorination with uv aop pre treatments fig 4 a f indicated the ph impact on aldehyde a and b nitrile c and d and n chloroaldimine e and f formation during post chlorination of aa precursors following two uv aop pre treatments following uv ps the amounts of aldehydes and nitriles formed from the selected aas during subsequent chlorination were both decreased by nearly 79 83 and 81 at ph 5 7 and 9 respectively and the formation of n choroaldimines were decreased by around 82 89 and 86 at ph 5 7 and 9 respectively in contrast uv h2o2 pre treatment decreased the formation of both aldehydes and nitriles from chlorination of aas by approximately 89 88 and 80 at ph 5 7 and 9 respectively the n choroaldimines concentrations were reduced by almost 97 96 and 85 at ph 5 7 and 9 respectively it can be inferred that the degradation rate of the aa precursor by uv ps at various ph followed the order ph 7 ph 9 ph 5 this result was similar to those of prior studies using uv ps to remove trichloroethylene liang et al 2007 and sulfamethazine gao et al 2012 liang et al illustrated that the required sulfate radical activation energy at room temperature followed the following order ph 7 ph 9 ph 5 liang et al 2007 thus the concentration of the sulfate radical would be maximum at ph 7 on the other hand at neutral and basic phs sulfate radicals can transform into hydroxyl radicals eqs 3 and 7 gao et al 2012 which have a higher oxidation potential than that of sulfate radicals thus the removal capacity of uv ps under neutral and basic conditions would be more powerful 7 so4 oh so4 2 oh for uv h2o2 pre treatment the results suggested that the removal rates of aa precursors by uv h2o2 were nearly the same at ph 5 and ph 7 but were higher than that at ph 9 two main reasons can explain this phenomenon first the alkaline conditions can promote h2o2 decomposition into h2o and o2 eq 8 tan et al 2013 thus decreasing the amount of available h2o2 second the dissociation of h2o2 would be enhanced at higher ph leading to an increase of ho2 since ho2 can react with h2o2 eq 9 and is an efficient oh scavenger eqs 10 and 11 muruganandham and swaminathan 2004 tan et al 2013 the amount of oh would decrease greatly as ho2 increases under alkaline conditions previous studies by aleboyeh et al 2005 and daneshvar et al 2008 who used uv h2o2 to degrade acid blue 74 and rhodamine b respectively showed consistent results 8 h2o2 h2o o2 9 ho2 h2o2 h2o o2 oh 10 ho2 oh h2o o2 11 ho2 oh ho2 oh overall uv h2o2 was more effective in controlling the formation of odorous by products during post chlorination of aas at ph 5 and 7 than at ph 9 uv ps presented better performance at ph 7 but was still less effective than uv h2o2 notably under alkaline conditions the two uv aops had almost the same effects but did not perform very well furthermore alkaline conditions promoted more formation of odorous by products as described in 3 4 1 thus controlling the formation of odorous by products from chlorination of aas using uv aop pre treatments is more difficult under alkaline conditions as the ph of et lake fluctuates between 7 and 8 uv h2o2 is more suitable for controlling the odorous by product formation from chlorination of aas in et lake 3 5 effect of chlorine dosage 3 5 1 effect of chlorine dosage on odorous by products formation during post chlorination without any pre treatment table 3 showed the formation of aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines under various chlorine dosages when cl aa 1 the reaction between aa and hocl only generated n monochloroamine rather than n n dichloroamine thus only aldehyde as the decomposed product of n monochloroamine was detected when cl aa 1 n n dichloroamine was formed by chlorination of n monochloroamine and subsequently degraded into nitrile and n chloroaldimine therefore the formation of aldehyde decreased while that of nitrile and n chloroaldimine increased a similar phenomenon was observed by freuze et al 2005 in contrast when the cl aa ratio increased to 3 0 excess residual chlorine reacted with aldehyde iv viii fig 2 promoting the hydrolysis of n chloroaldimine into both aldehyde and nitrile to maintain equilibrium so the n chloroaldimine formation decreased while the aldehyde content exhibited nearly no change however the nitrile decomposition was not promoted as the chlorine dosage increased thus nitrile accumulated due to extra formation from n chloroaldimine this result was consistent with that of a prior study how et al 2018 3 5 2 effect of chlorine dosage on odorous by products formation during post chlorination with uv aop pre treatment the formation of aldehydes a and b nitriles c and d and n chloroaldimines e and f during post chlorination of aas under different chlorine dosages following two uv aop pre treatments was displayed in fig 5 a f the aldehydes formed from selected aas during subsequent chlorination were decreased by nearly 73 90 83 and 83 at cl aa ratios of 0 8 1 2 2 4 and 3 0 respectively after uv ps pre treatment and by around 79 93 88 and 88 at cl aa ratios of 0 8 1 2 2 4 and 3 0 respectively following uv h2o2 pre treatment in contrast the amounts of nitriles produced by chlorination of selected aas following uv ps pre treatment were increased by approximately 37 at cl aa 1 2 and decreased by around 83 at both cl aa ratios of 2 4 and 3 0 following uv h2o2 pre treatment the concentrations of nitriles were increased by approximately 22 at cl aa 1 2 and decreased by around 88 at both cl aa ratios of 2 4 and 3 0 for n chloroaldimines the formation following uv ps was increased by approximately 16 at cl aa 1 2 and decreased by around 89 and 93 at cl aa ratios of 2 4 and 3 0 respectively while uv h2o2 increased the concentrations of n chloroaldimines by approximately 4 at cl aa 1 2 and decreased by approximately 96 and 99 at cl aa ratios of 2 4 and 3 0 respectively notably although nitriles and n chloroaldimines were undetected during chlorination of aas at cl aa 0 8 in experiments without any pre treatment the applications of uv aop pre treatments led to a few nitrile and n chloroaldimine yields as mentioned above both uv aops can effectively remove aa precursors some of the degradation products cannot consume chlorine thus if subsequent chlorine dosage did not change the actual cl aa ratio following uv aop pre treatments would become slightly higher than the designed cl aa ratio at the designed cl aa ratios of 0 8 and 1 2 the pre treatment of aa precursor caused the cl aa ratio to increase slightly leading to more n n dichloroamine formation and then decomposition into more nitrile and n chloroaldimine moreover when cl aa 2 the closer the cl aa ratio was to 1 0 the more aldehyde was produced thus the aldehyde formation from aa during subsequent chlorination after uv aop pre treatments was decreased by the lowest and highest percentage at cl aa ratios of0 8 and 1 2 respectively when cl aa 2 the higher cl aa ratio would promote the reaction between excess residual chlorine and aldehyde however n chloroaldimine would hydrolyze into aldehyde to maintain equilibrium making the aldehyde content exhibit nearly no change therefore the aldehyde formation from post chlorination of aas after uv aop pre treatment was decreased by the same percentage at cl aa ratios of 2 4 and 3 0 moreover since higher cl aa ratio meant more remaining chlorine oxidizing aldehyde and then more n chloroaldimine degraded into aldehyde the n chloroaldimine formation during post chlorination of aas following uv aop pre treatments was decreased more at cl aa 3 0 than at cl aa 2 4 in general the two uv aops had poor effects on reducing the formation of aldehydes at cl aa 0 8 the formation of other two odorous by products was increased after both uv aop pre treatments at cl aa ratios of 0 8 and 1 2 however as the nitrile and n chloroaldimine formation during chlorination of aas was limited at cl aa 2 the increase in the formation of these compounds would not lead to off flavor problems at cl aa 2 both uv aops performed well on reducing the formation of the three odorous byproducts considering the aas concentrations in et lake and the practical chlorine dosage in dwtps the cl aa ratio would be higher than 2 thus applying uv aop pre treatments can effectively control odorous by product formation 3 6 applications of uv aops to control the formation of odorous by products in real water from the et lake as stated in 3 1 the concentrations of val leu and ile were measured to be 1727 ng l 15 nm 2831 ng l 22 nm and 2653 ng l 20 nm in autumn and the concentrations of odorous by products formed from chlorination of the three aas may be higher than their odor perception thresholds if these aa precursors cannot be removed the results proved that the uv aops effectively controlled the formation of odorous by products from aas during subsequent chlorination in ultrapure water however whether these pre treatment processes had good effects in real water remained unknown thus experiments in water from et lake using environmentally relevant concentration of each aa 50 nm were conducted fig si8a c showed the effects of uv aop pre treatments on the formation of aldehydes a nitriles b and n chloroaldimines c from val leu and ile during post chlorination in real water from et lake following uv ps pre oxidation the formation of aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines from post chlorination of the selected aas were decreased by approximately 78 79 and 87 respectively and the isobutyraldehyde formed from val was undetected in contrast uv h2o2 pre treatment decreased the concentrations of aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines formed by subsequent chlorination of the selected aas by approximately 82 82 and 91 respectively the 2 methylbutyraldehyde and 2 methylbutyronitrile formed from ile and isobutyraldehyde formed from val were undetected of note after uv aop pre treatments the concentrations of all odorous by products formed from aas were lower than their odor perception thresholds thus it can be thought that the two uv aops can control the odor problem caused by chlorination of aas in real water from et lake and uv h2o2 was more effective than uv ps 4 conclusion et lake contains 20 kinds of common aas and their concentrations reach maximum values in autumn due to algal blooms val leu and ile are presented at high levels and have the potential to produce odorous by products at concentrations exceeding their odor perception thresholds both uv aops effectively decreased the formation of odorous by products during post chlorination and uv h2o2 performed better than uv ps moreover for both pre treatments the formation of n chloroaldimines during post chlorination were reduced more than that of aldehydes and nitriles under acidic and neutral conditions uv h2o2 reduced odorous by product formation more efficiently than uv ps under alkaline conditions the two uv aops had almost the same effects and did not perform very well as alkaline conditions promoted the formation of odorous by products using uv aop pre treatments to control the formation of odorous by products is more difficult under alkaline conditions the impacts of uv aop pre treatments on decreasing aldehyde formation at different cl aa ratios followed the order cl aa 1 2 cl aa 2 4 cl aa 3 0 cl aa 0 8 in contrast uv aop pre treatments slightly increased the nitrile and n chloroaldimine formation during subsequent chlorination at cl aaratios of 0 8 and 1 2 at cl aa 2 the uv aops effectively decreased the formation of nitriles and n chloroaldimines two uv aops can effectively control the odorous by product formation from chlorination of aas in real water from et lake considering the effectiveness of uv aops and the water quality characteristics of et lake uv h2o2 is the more suitable process furthermore since the real cl aa ratio in dwtps is higher than 2 the

18662,certain amino acids aas can form odorous aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines during chlorination ultraviolet uv photolysis ultraviolet persulfate uv ps and ultraviolet hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 treatments have been reported to decrease trace organic contaminants in drinking water in this study 20 common aas in east taihu et lake the main drinking water source for the surrounding cities were determined during one year four seasons the impacts of uv photolysis alone and two uv advanced oxidation process aop pre treatments on the formation of aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines during post chlorination of water containing three of the most detected aas i e valine val leucine leu and isoleucine ile in et lake were investigated results showed that the two uv aops significantly decreased the odorous by product formation from aas compared with uv photolysis alone the formation of n chloroaldimines was more easily controlled than that of aldehyde and nitrile furthermore uv h2o2 was more effective than uv ps at ph 5 and 7 at ph 9 the two uv aops had similar effects and did not perform very well in addition the uv aops controlled the formation of odorous by products effectively at cl aa molar ratio of chlorine to amino acid ratios of 2 4 and 3 0 but increased their formation at cl aa ratios of 0 8 and 1 2 experiments in real water showed that uv h2o2 was more suitable for controlling the off flavor problem caused by chlorination of aas in et lake graphical abstract image 1 keywords amino acids odorous by products aldehydes nitriles n chloroaldimines advanced oxidation technology 1 introduction taihu lake is the third largest freshwater lake in china and the water source for millions of people in several cities however quantities of nutrients have been introduced into taihu lake due to the random discharge of industrial wastewater agriculture run off and domestic sewage over the past few decades having made the lake severely eutrophic and cause algal blooms to occur guo 2007 li et al 2018 the metabolism and death of algae lead to high concentration of organic matter that can react with chlorine the most common disinfectant in drinking water treatment forming various disinfection by products dbps sedlak and von gunten 2011 some types of dbps are potentially genotoxic and carcinogenic richardson et al 2007 while other types are non harmful but lead to off flavor problems causing consumer to worry about the safety of drinking water zhang et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 amino acids aas are a type of organic contaminant metabolized by algae previous studies have indicated that chlorination of certain aas can produce odorous organic chloramines aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines r ch ncl freuze et al 2005 how et al 2017 among these odorous dbps aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines are stable and as shown in the supporting information si table si1 their odor perception thresholds are low at μg l level the concentrations of their aa precursors in drinking water sources range from 0 to 10 μg l in southern california chinn and barrett 2000 and from 0 to 30 μg l in several plants in western france berne et al 1994 as traditional drinking water treatment processes are ineffective at removing the low molecular weight aas before the chlorination step dotson and westerhoff 2009 the concentrations of the odorous by products formed from aas during chlorination may be high and cause serious odor problems thus it is necessary to take valid measures to control off flavor by product formation during chlorination of aas there have been few studies on the control of odorous by product formation from the chlorination of aa precursors according to the control of other dbps a promising method is to remove the precursors of these odorous byproducts prior to chlorination bond et al 2011 some studies have reported that ultraviolet uv treatment alone can degrade organic matter to compounds with lower molecular weight magnuson et al 2002 shah et al 2011 moreover uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops especially ultraviolet hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 and ultraviolet persulfate uv ps processes can efficiently degrade various trace organic contaminants dotson et al 2010 however whether these processes can decrease the formation of odorous by products produced from aas has not been reported thus the objective of this study was to investigate the influence of uv and uv aop pre treatments on the formation of odorous by products during post chlorination of aas and find the most effective process in this paper 20 kinds of common aas in east taihu et lake the major drinking water source for the surrounding cities were monitored for a whole year four seasons three of the most detected aas i e val leu and ile were chosen as representative odorous by product precursors the impacts of uv irradiation and two uv aop uv h2o2 and uv ps pre treatments on the formation of three odorous by products aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines from aas during subsequent chlorination were investigated the effects of uv intensity oxidant dosage ph and chlorine dosage on the pre treatment performance were also evaluated and the applications of these processes in real water from et lake were also conducted which aimed to select an effective process for controling the odor problems caused by chlorination of aas in et lake 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents all chemicals and solvents listed in table si2 were at least analytical reagent grade all solutions were prepared in millipore water without chlorine demand 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 water sampling algae cultivation and preparation for aa analysis raw water samples were collected from the wujiang drinking water treatment plant dwtp which uses the et lake as the water source the water quality characteristics of the water samples are listed in table 1 microcystis aeruginosa was obtained from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences cultivation and intracellular organic matter iom extraction were described in text si1 the aas in water samples and the iom of microcystis aeruginosa were enriched by solid phase extraction spe before analysis the details of spe preparation are listed in text si2 2 2 2 uv uv aop treatments and chlorination the irradiation experiments were conducted in a 1 6 l cylindrical photoreactor as displayed in fig si1 in the uv alone treatment experiments each aa val leu and ile model solution 50 ml 0 1 mm was added to a ground quartz test tube with plug respectively and irradiated for the designed time in the uv ps and uv h2o2 experiments calculated amounts of ps or h2o2 solution were dosed and stirred immediately before the test tubes were moved into the photoreactor the temperature in the photoreactor was 25 c 1 c the effect of ps or h2o2 pre oxidation alone was also investigated by adding the oxidant into aa solution without uv irradiation after pre treatment 10 ml of treated aa solution was transferred into a 20 ml brown headspace sample vial the 10 ml of treated aa solution was chlorinated by adding appropriate microvolumes of sodium hypochlorite solutions following thorough stirring for 20 s the solution was incubated in dark at room temperature for 3 h all reactions were conducted in buffer solutions and h2so4 and naoh were added for ph adjustment the experiments were all carried out at least twice and average values were used in the diagrams with error bars showing one standard deviation 2 3 chemical analysis solution ph was measured by a ph meter la ph10 hach usa doc and was determined by a toc analyzer shimadzu toc vcph japan the concentration of free chlorine was detected by a portable residual chlorine meter dr2800 hach usa the concentrations of 20 aas were determined by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms agilent usa after spe the measurement conditions and gradient elution conditions of hplc were listed in table si3 and table si4 respectively the ms was operated in electrospray ionization esi positive mode and multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode and the operating parameters were obtained from a study by how et al how et al 2018 the volatile odorous by products including corresponding aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines of val leu and ile were extracted by headspace solid phase micro extraction hs spme with a 75 μm car pdms spme fiber supelco usa and then measured by gas chromatograph mass spectrometry 5977 7890b agilent usa this method was modified from a prior study how et al 2017 and the details were described in text si3 and text si4 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of 20 kinds of aas in et lake the total aas and 20 kinds of common aas including tyrosine tyr tryptophan try threonine thr serine ser proline pro phe ornithine orn methionine met leu ile histidine his glycine gly glutamic acid glu glutamine gln aspartic acid asp asparagines asn arginine arg lysine lys val and alanine ala were determined in et lake during four seasons as shown in fig si2 the total aas content in et lake was 32158 ng l in autumn and approximately 3000 ng l in other seasons from fig 1 a d the concentrations of the 20 aas ranged from 0 to 9000 ng l and most aas reached maximums in autumn these results were similar to those of a prior study by brosillon et al who demonstrated that the concentrations of some aas in the raw water from three dwtps in paris were higher in autumn brosillon et al 2009 notably the contents of val leu ile and phe which have been reported to be odorous by product precursors how et al 2018 were 1727 ng l 2831 ng l 2653 ng l and 2873 ng l in autumn respectively and were approximately 100 300 ng l in other seasons hureiki et al illustrated that the aa content in water was relevant to the concentration of algae hureiki et al 1994 as the algal blooms in et lake mainly occurr in august and september annually the high level of aas in autumn may be related to the increased algae quantity to prove it iom of microcystis aeruginosa which is the dominant algae in et lake was analyzed from fig si3 the iom of microcystis aeruginosa contained many kinds of aas among which lys orn leu ile phe and val were presented at high levels particularly the latter four aas are odorous by products precursors how et al 2018 the concentrations of thr ser met gly gln asp and asn were low these results were highly similar to those obtained for et lake in autumn as shown in fig 1b thus the higher aa concentrations in et lake in autumn were plausibly caused by the algal blooms during this time the aas in the iom of algae were released when the algal cells ruptured the maximum quantities of odorous aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines formed were reported to be approximately 12 60 and 40 of the initial quantity of each aa precursor respectively when cl aa the molar ratio of chlorine to amino acid 2 freuze et al 2005 how et al 2017 considering the val leu and ile contents in et lake in autumn the concentrations of odorous n chloroaldimines and aldehydes formed will be 3 4 times higher and slightly higher than their odor perception thresholds table si1 respectively if the aa precursors cannot be better removed however traditional treatment processes cannot efficiently degrade the low molecular weight aas dotson and westerhoff 2009 thus additional pre treatment is needed to control the odorous by product formation from chlorination of aas in et lake 3 2 impact of uv pre treatment alone on odorous by product formation the impact of uv photolysis on the formation of aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines during subsequent chlorination of the selected aas were shown in fig si4a c uv irradiation alone with a medium pressure mp uv lamp reduced the formation of odorous by products during chlorination of val leu and ile although the effectiveness was not obvious unless the uv dosage was high under a uv dose of 37800 mj cm2 the formation of aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines from chlorination of the three selected aas were decreased by approximately 35 40 and 45 respectively from fig si5 the concentrations of aas were decreased after high dosage uv irradiation indicating that the mp uv lamp degraded the aa precursors freuze et al 2006 previous studies have indicated that the polychromatic output emitted by a mp uv lamp can degrade organic precursors into lower molecular weight products thus the formation of the corresponding dbps during chlorination would be impacted shah et al 2011 notably the formation of aldehydes from post chlorination of aas after uv photolysis was decreased to a less degree than that of nitriles and n chloroaldimines this difference may have occurred because uv irradiation degraded selected aas into some products with greater potential to form aldehydes in contrast the formation of n chloroaldimines was decreased the most this can be explained by the formation and degradation pathways displayed in fig 2 since the degradation of aas by uv pre treatment led to excess residual chlorine the oxidation of aldehyde by extra hocl into carboxylic acid iv viii was promoted indirectly resulting in more n chloroaldimine degradation into aldehyde to reach equilibrium vi iv how et al 2018 in summary only a high dosage of mp uv pre treatment can somewhat reduce the formation of the three odorous by products from the selected aas during subsequent chlorination 3 3 impacts of uv aop pre treatments on odorous by product formation the effects of ps and h2o2 pre oxidations alone were first investigated however from fig si6 the odorous by product formation during post chlorination of val leu and ile did not change significantly after either ps or h2o2 pre oxidation fig si7 indicated that neither ps nor h2o2 oxidation alone had an obvious effect on aas concentraions these results suggested that ps or h2o2 pre oxidation alone could not control odorous by product formation indicating uv photolysis was needed in all uv aop experiments the residuals of aas ps and h2o2 were undetected and the concentration of residual chlorine in control exiperiments with no pre treatment of val leu and ile were measured as 1 153 mg l 1 150 mg l and 1 158 mg l respectively fig 3 a f presented the effects of uv aop pre treatments on the formation of aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines from val a and b leu c and d and ile e and f during post chlorination under different oxidant dosages following uv ps pre oxidation the formation of aldehydes and nitriles from post chlorination of the selected aas were both decreased by approximately 10 15 83 and 95 at ps aa ratios of 1 5 and 10 respectively and the formation of n chloroaldimines were decreased by approximately 17 90 and 99 at ps aa ratios of 1 5 and 10 respectively in contrast the uv h2o2 pre treatment decreased the concentrations of both aldehydes and nitriles formed from post chlorination of the selected aas by nearly 16 18 88 and 99 at h2o2 aa ratios of 1 5 and 10 respectively the n chloroaldimine formation was decreased following uv h2o2 pre treatment by approximate 22 96 and 99 at h2o2 aa ratios of 1 5 and 10 respectively moreover the concentrations of aas listed in fig si7 decreased after uv aop pre treatments the results suggested that uv aop pre treatments decreased odorous by product formation and the effects improved as the oxidant dosages increased as eqs 1 and 2 show uv irradiation can cause ps and h2o2 to produce sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals respectively tan et al 2013 of note part of so4 would produce oh under neutral condition as shown in eq 3 gao et al 2012 the oxidation potentials of the sulfate radical e0 2 8 v and hydroxyl radical e0 2 9 v are very high both radicals can effectively decompose organic pollutants such as aas lamsal et al 2011 tan et al 2013 ying et al 2016 thus the odorous by product formation from the selected aas during subsequent chlorination was decreased moreover one way analysis of variance was conducted showing that uv h2o2 is more effective at reducing the formation of odorous by products than uv ps p 0 05 which may be because aa precursors are more easily degraded by uv h2o2 than by uv ps 1 s2o8 2 hv 2so4 2 h2o2 hv 2oh 3 so4 h2o so4 2 oh h notably after uv ps or uv h2o2 pre treatment the levels of aldehydes and nitriles from the subsequent chlorination were decreased by similar percentages under the same ps or h2o2 dosage which was different from the results observed for uv pre treatment alone this result may be because the two uv aops can oxidize aas more thoroughly thus no other aldehyde precursors were produced nevertheless the formation of n chloroaldimines was still reduced the most among the three odorous by products this was probably because the aas were more effectively decomposed by both uv aops than by uv pre treatment alone leading more chlorine to remain and react with aldehyde as described in 3 2 when more aldehyde was oxidized by hocl more n chloroaldimine decomposed into aldehydes to maintain equilibrium in summary the efficiency of decreasing the formation of odorous by products from the selected aas followed the order uv h2o2 uv ps uv 3 4 effect of ph 3 4 1 effect of ph on odorous by products formation during post chlorination without any pre treatment table 2 displayed the molar conversions of the selected aas to odorous by products during chlorination at different ph considering the actual ph of et lake ph 5 7 and 9 were applied as shown in fig 2 nitrile vii and n chloroaldimine vi are degradation products of n n dichloramine v and hcl is generated during the processes thus acidic conditions would suppress the decomposition of n n dichloramine v into nitrile vii and n chloroaldimine vi for this reason both nitrile and n chloroaldimine had lower production at ph 5 and their concentrations increased as ph increased nevertheless the formation of nitriles at ph 9 was nearly the same as that at ph 7 this may have been because a higher ph can also accelerate the hydrolysis of nitriles vii viii yu and reckhow 2015 aldehydes were reported to be produced mainly by the hydrolysis of n chloroaldimine vi iv at cl aa 2 how et al 2017 this process also produced nh2cl which had hydrolysis eqs 4 and 5 and disproportionation eq 6 reactions in water valentine and jafvert 1988 under acidic conditions the formed nh3 in hydrolysis reaction could react with h and the disproportionation of nh2cl was catalyzed by the hydrogen ion valentine and jafvert 1988 thus nh2cl was unstable under acidic conditions which promoted the hydrolysis of n chloroaldimine vi iv to reach an equilibrium moreover acidic conditions could suppress the reaction between extra hocl and aldehyde iv viii when cl aa 2 therefore more aldehydes formed at ph 5 than at higher ph surprisingly the yield of aldehyde at ph 9 increased slightly compared to that at ph 7 this may have been because alkaline conditions would promote the n monochloramino acid degradation into aldehyde ii iv although at cl aa 2 this process is not the dominate formation pathway of aldehyde and occurs only during a short time at the beginning of the reaction the rate constant of this reaction is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the n chloroaldimine hydrolysis reaction how et al 2017 4 nh2cl h2o nh3 hclo 5 nh2cl hclo nhcl2 h2o 6 nh2c1 nh2c1 nhc12 nh3 in summary more odorous by products would be formed from chlorination of aas under neutral and alkaline conditions thus operators are suggested to appropriately lower the ph of water before chlorination step 3 4 2 effect of ph on odorous by products formation during post chlorination with uv aop pre treatments fig 4 a f indicated the ph impact on aldehyde a and b nitrile c and d and n chloroaldimine e and f formation during post chlorination of aa precursors following two uv aop pre treatments following uv ps the amounts of aldehydes and nitriles formed from the selected aas during subsequent chlorination were both decreased by nearly 79 83 and 81 at ph 5 7 and 9 respectively and the formation of n choroaldimines were decreased by around 82 89 and 86 at ph 5 7 and 9 respectively in contrast uv h2o2 pre treatment decreased the formation of both aldehydes and nitriles from chlorination of aas by approximately 89 88 and 80 at ph 5 7 and 9 respectively the n choroaldimines concentrations were reduced by almost 97 96 and 85 at ph 5 7 and 9 respectively it can be inferred that the degradation rate of the aa precursor by uv ps at various ph followed the order ph 7 ph 9 ph 5 this result was similar to those of prior studies using uv ps to remove trichloroethylene liang et al 2007 and sulfamethazine gao et al 2012 liang et al illustrated that the required sulfate radical activation energy at room temperature followed the following order ph 7 ph 9 ph 5 liang et al 2007 thus the concentration of the sulfate radical would be maximum at ph 7 on the other hand at neutral and basic phs sulfate radicals can transform into hydroxyl radicals eqs 3 and 7 gao et al 2012 which have a higher oxidation potential than that of sulfate radicals thus the removal capacity of uv ps under neutral and basic conditions would be more powerful 7 so4 oh so4 2 oh for uv h2o2 pre treatment the results suggested that the removal rates of aa precursors by uv h2o2 were nearly the same at ph 5 and ph 7 but were higher than that at ph 9 two main reasons can explain this phenomenon first the alkaline conditions can promote h2o2 decomposition into h2o and o2 eq 8 tan et al 2013 thus decreasing the amount of available h2o2 second the dissociation of h2o2 would be enhanced at higher ph leading to an increase of ho2 since ho2 can react with h2o2 eq 9 and is an efficient oh scavenger eqs 10 and 11 muruganandham and swaminathan 2004 tan et al 2013 the amount of oh would decrease greatly as ho2 increases under alkaline conditions previous studies by aleboyeh et al 2005 and daneshvar et al 2008 who used uv h2o2 to degrade acid blue 74 and rhodamine b respectively showed consistent results 8 h2o2 h2o o2 9 ho2 h2o2 h2o o2 oh 10 ho2 oh h2o o2 11 ho2 oh ho2 oh overall uv h2o2 was more effective in controlling the formation of odorous by products during post chlorination of aas at ph 5 and 7 than at ph 9 uv ps presented better performance at ph 7 but was still less effective than uv h2o2 notably under alkaline conditions the two uv aops had almost the same effects but did not perform very well furthermore alkaline conditions promoted more formation of odorous by products as described in 3 4 1 thus controlling the formation of odorous by products from chlorination of aas using uv aop pre treatments is more difficult under alkaline conditions as the ph of et lake fluctuates between 7 and 8 uv h2o2 is more suitable for controlling the odorous by product formation from chlorination of aas in et lake 3 5 effect of chlorine dosage 3 5 1 effect of chlorine dosage on odorous by products formation during post chlorination without any pre treatment table 3 showed the formation of aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines under various chlorine dosages when cl aa 1 the reaction between aa and hocl only generated n monochloroamine rather than n n dichloroamine thus only aldehyde as the decomposed product of n monochloroamine was detected when cl aa 1 n n dichloroamine was formed by chlorination of n monochloroamine and subsequently degraded into nitrile and n chloroaldimine therefore the formation of aldehyde decreased while that of nitrile and n chloroaldimine increased a similar phenomenon was observed by freuze et al 2005 in contrast when the cl aa ratio increased to 3 0 excess residual chlorine reacted with aldehyde iv viii fig 2 promoting the hydrolysis of n chloroaldimine into both aldehyde and nitrile to maintain equilibrium so the n chloroaldimine formation decreased while the aldehyde content exhibited nearly no change however the nitrile decomposition was not promoted as the chlorine dosage increased thus nitrile accumulated due to extra formation from n chloroaldimine this result was consistent with that of a prior study how et al 2018 3 5 2 effect of chlorine dosage on odorous by products formation during post chlorination with uv aop pre treatment the formation of aldehydes a and b nitriles c and d and n chloroaldimines e and f during post chlorination of aas under different chlorine dosages following two uv aop pre treatments was displayed in fig 5 a f the aldehydes formed from selected aas during subsequent chlorination were decreased by nearly 73 90 83 and 83 at cl aa ratios of 0 8 1 2 2 4 and 3 0 respectively after uv ps pre treatment and by around 79 93 88 and 88 at cl aa ratios of 0 8 1 2 2 4 and 3 0 respectively following uv h2o2 pre treatment in contrast the amounts of nitriles produced by chlorination of selected aas following uv ps pre treatment were increased by approximately 37 at cl aa 1 2 and decreased by around 83 at both cl aa ratios of 2 4 and 3 0 following uv h2o2 pre treatment the concentrations of nitriles were increased by approximately 22 at cl aa 1 2 and decreased by around 88 at both cl aa ratios of 2 4 and 3 0 for n chloroaldimines the formation following uv ps was increased by approximately 16 at cl aa 1 2 and decreased by around 89 and 93 at cl aa ratios of 2 4 and 3 0 respectively while uv h2o2 increased the concentrations of n chloroaldimines by approximately 4 at cl aa 1 2 and decreased by approximately 96 and 99 at cl aa ratios of 2 4 and 3 0 respectively notably although nitriles and n chloroaldimines were undetected during chlorination of aas at cl aa 0 8 in experiments without any pre treatment the applications of uv aop pre treatments led to a few nitrile and n chloroaldimine yields as mentioned above both uv aops can effectively remove aa precursors some of the degradation products cannot consume chlorine thus if subsequent chlorine dosage did not change the actual cl aa ratio following uv aop pre treatments would become slightly higher than the designed cl aa ratio at the designed cl aa ratios of 0 8 and 1 2 the pre treatment of aa precursor caused the cl aa ratio to increase slightly leading to more n n dichloroamine formation and then decomposition into more nitrile and n chloroaldimine moreover when cl aa 2 the closer the cl aa ratio was to 1 0 the more aldehyde was produced thus the aldehyde formation from aa during subsequent chlorination after uv aop pre treatments was decreased by the lowest and highest percentage at cl aa ratios of0 8 and 1 2 respectively when cl aa 2 the higher cl aa ratio would promote the reaction between excess residual chlorine and aldehyde however n chloroaldimine would hydrolyze into aldehyde to maintain equilibrium making the aldehyde content exhibit nearly no change therefore the aldehyde formation from post chlorination of aas after uv aop pre treatment was decreased by the same percentage at cl aa ratios of 2 4 and 3 0 moreover since higher cl aa ratio meant more remaining chlorine oxidizing aldehyde and then more n chloroaldimine degraded into aldehyde the n chloroaldimine formation during post chlorination of aas following uv aop pre treatments was decreased more at cl aa 3 0 than at cl aa 2 4 in general the two uv aops had poor effects on reducing the formation of aldehydes at cl aa 0 8 the formation of other two odorous by products was increased after both uv aop pre treatments at cl aa ratios of 0 8 and 1 2 however as the nitrile and n chloroaldimine formation during chlorination of aas was limited at cl aa 2 the increase in the formation of these compounds would not lead to off flavor problems at cl aa 2 both uv aops performed well on reducing the formation of the three odorous byproducts considering the aas concentrations in et lake and the practical chlorine dosage in dwtps the cl aa ratio would be higher than 2 thus applying uv aop pre treatments can effectively control odorous by product formation 3 6 applications of uv aops to control the formation of odorous by products in real water from the et lake as stated in 3 1 the concentrations of val leu and ile were measured to be 1727 ng l 15 nm 2831 ng l 22 nm and 2653 ng l 20 nm in autumn and the concentrations of odorous by products formed from chlorination of the three aas may be higher than their odor perception thresholds if these aa precursors cannot be removed the results proved that the uv aops effectively controlled the formation of odorous by products from aas during subsequent chlorination in ultrapure water however whether these pre treatment processes had good effects in real water remained unknown thus experiments in water from et lake using environmentally relevant concentration of each aa 50 nm were conducted fig si8a c showed the effects of uv aop pre treatments on the formation of aldehydes a nitriles b and n chloroaldimines c from val leu and ile during post chlorination in real water from et lake following uv ps pre oxidation the formation of aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines from post chlorination of the selected aas were decreased by approximately 78 79 and 87 respectively and the isobutyraldehyde formed from val was undetected in contrast uv h2o2 pre treatment decreased the concentrations of aldehydes nitriles and n chloroaldimines formed by subsequent chlorination of the selected aas by approximately 82 82 and 91 respectively the 2 methylbutyraldehyde and 2 methylbutyronitrile formed from ile and isobutyraldehyde formed from val were undetected of note after uv aop pre treatments the concentrations of all odorous by products formed from aas were lower than their odor perception thresholds thus it can be thought that the two uv aops can control the odor problem caused by chlorination of aas in real water from et lake and uv h2o2 was more effective than uv ps 4 conclusion et lake contains 20 kinds of common aas and their concentrations reach maximum values in autumn due to algal blooms val leu and ile are presented at high levels and have the potential to produce odorous by products at concentrations exceeding their odor perception thresholds both uv aops effectively decreased the formation of odorous by products during post chlorination and uv h2o2 performed better than uv ps moreover for both pre treatments the formation of n chloroaldimines during post chlorination were reduced more than that of aldehydes and nitriles under acidic and neutral conditions uv h2o2 reduced odorous by product formation more efficiently than uv ps under alkaline conditions the two uv aops had almost the same effects and did not perform very well as alkaline conditions promoted the formation of odorous by products using uv aop pre treatments to control the formation of odorous by products is more difficult under alkaline conditions the impacts of uv aop pre treatments on decreasing aldehyde formation at different cl aa ratios followed the order cl aa 1 2 cl aa 2 4 cl aa 3 0 cl aa 0 8 in contrast uv aop pre treatments slightly increased the nitrile and n chloroaldimine formation during subsequent chlorination at cl aaratios of 0 8 and 1 2 at cl aa 2 the uv aops effectively decreased the formation of nitriles and n chloroaldimines two uv aops can effectively control the odorous by product formation from chlorination of aas in real water from et lake considering the effectiveness of uv aops and the water quality characteristics of et lake uv h2o2 is the more suitable process furthermore since the real cl aa ratio in dwtps is higher than 2 the

18663,the objective of this study was to implement electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops for mineralization and biodegradability enhancement of nanofiltration nf concentrate from landfill leachate initially pre treated in a membrane bioreactor mbr raw carbon felt cf or feiifeiii layered double hydroxides modified cf were used for comparing the efficiency of homogeneous and heterogeneous electro fenton ef respectively the highest mineralization rate was obtained by heterogeneous ef 96 removal of dissolved organic carbon doc was achieved after 8 h of electrolysis at circumneutral initial ph ph0 7 9 and at 8 3 ma cm 2 however the most efficient treatment strategy appeared to be heterogeneous ef at 4 2 ma cm 2 combined with anodic oxidation using ti4o7 anode energy consumption 0 11 kwh g 1 of doc removed respirometric analyses under similar conditions than in the real mbr emphasized the possibility to recirculate the nf retentate towards the mbr after partial mineralization by eaops in order to remove the residual biodegradable by products and improve the global cost effectiveness of the process further analyses were also performed in order to better understand the fate of organic and inorganic species during the treatment including acute toxicity tests microtox characterization of dissolved organic matter by three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy evolution of inorganic ions clo3 nh4 and no3 and identification quantification of degradation by products such as carboxylic acids the obtained results emphasized the interdependence between the mbr process and eaops in a combined treatment strategy improving the retention in the mbr of colloidal proteins would improve the effectiveness of eaops because such compounds were identified as the most refractory enhanced nitrification would be also required in the mbr because of the release of nh4 from mineralization of refractory organic nitrogen during eaops graphical

layers of landfills generates leachates containing a complex mixture of dissolved organic matter dom inorganic compounds heavy metals and xenobiotic organic substances kjeldsen et al 2002 which represents a significant hazard for the environment the implementation of a membrane bioreactor mbr followed by a nanofiltration nf step is one of the most efficient treatment strategy currently used for management of landfill leachates campagna et al 2013 amaral et al 2016 however nf is only a separation process biorefractory organic pollutants are accumulated and concentrated thus the concentrate becomes an important residual issue for this treatment strategy van der bruggen et al 2003 zhang et al 2009 2013 landfill discharge of the concentrate is commonly performed however some national regulations do not allow such practice and it clearly does not fix the long term issue in recent years several processes have been investigated and applied at industrial scale for the treatment of nf concentrate for example adsorption processes are effective to remove organic matters in nf concentrate but they are strongly limited by the high organic charge of such effluents compared to the adsorption capacity of adsorbent materials besides membrane distillation and evaporation processes are substantially limited by the high cost of equipment and energy consumption cui et al 2018 during the last two decades electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have received great attention for efficient degradation of a large range of hazardous and biorefractory organic compounds they are based on in situ electrogeneration of hydroxyl radicals oh a non selective and powerful oxidizing agent e oh h2o 2 80 v vs she brillas et al 2009 comninellis et al 2008 martínez huitle et al 2015 panizza and cerisola 2009 eaops provide also several technical advantages such as high versatility easy operation possibility for automation and low consumption of chemical reagents radjenovic and sedlak 2015 sirés et al 2014 however complete mineralization of organic compounds requires high energy consumption therefore the combination of eaops with biological processes is currently more and more investigated as a feasible option for improving the global cost effectiveness of the process oller et al 2011 ganzenko et al 2014 2018 trellu et al 2016a olvera vargas et al 2015 in order to achieve reliable conclusions the accurate assessment of biodegradability enhancement by eaops requires the use of proper measurement tools such as respirometric methods reuschenbach et al 2003 anodic oxidation ao and electro fenton ef are the most popularized eaops brillas et al 2009 panizza and cerisola 2009 martínez huitle et al 2015 oturan et al 2015 ao is based on the

homogeneous ef requires external iron source and acidic ph i e ph 2 5 3 5 that prevents iron precipitation brillas et al 2009 besides heterogeneous ef using for example pyrite ammar et al 2015 or iron loaded sepiolite iglesias et al 2013 as iron source has been developed in order to operate the process over a wide ph range ganiyu et al 2018a b poza nogueiras et al 2018 innovative electrodes have been also synthesized and studied as both heterogeneous catalyst source and cathode materials zhang et al 2012 wang et al 2013 garcía rodríguez et al 2016 ganiyu et al 2017a particularly the modification of raw carbon felt cf with cofe or feiifeiii layered double hydroxide ldh also led to an increase of the electroactive surface area which in turn improved the generation of h2o2 and the global efficiency of the heterogeneous ef process ganiyu et al 2017a 2018a b however to the best of our knowledge none study focused on the application of such promising electrodes for the treatment of real wastewaters as regards to anode materials sub stoichiometric titanium oxides especially ti4o7 recently received great attention for application in wastewater treatment by ao guo et al 2016 ganiyu et al 2016 trellu et al 2018b ti4o7 anode is able to generate large amounts of physisorbed hydroxyl radicals ti4o7 oh for the degradation and mineralization of organic contaminants besides this material has the potential to become a low cost anode compared to the well known boron doped diamond anode ganiyu et al 2017b trellu et al 2018b however to the best of our knowledge such anode material has also still not been applied for the treatment of real effluents the objective of this study was to investigate the application of these novel electrode materials for the treatment of a nf concentrate of landfill leachate initially pre treated in a mbr which represents an important challenge for environmental engineering various configurations i e homogeneous ef heterogeneous ef heterogeneous ef ao and operating conditions were studied the efficiency for mineralization of organic compounds was compared a particular attention was also given to the understanding of mineralization mechanisms by using various analytical tools i dom was characterized by three dimensional excitation and emission matrix fluorescence 3deem ii degradation by products such as short chain carboxylic acids were identified and quantified by ion exclusion hplc and iii inorganic ions released during the mineralization process were identified and quantified by ion chromatography moreover acute toxicity of the effluent was assessed by microtox analysis and the possibility to use such eaops as a pre treatment before recirculation towards the mbr was assessed by using respirometric method under similar conditions than in the real industrial mbr finally recommendations were given by taking into consideration the interdependence of mbr process and eaop in a combined treatment strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals for the preparation of feiifeiii ldh modified cf iron iii nitrate nonahydrate fe no3 3 9h2o cas 7782 61 8 98 purity iron ii sulfate

resistivity 18 mω cm at 25 c was used for the preparation of all solutions 2 2 landfill leachate nf concentrate the nf concentrate was collected from a landfill leachate wastewater treatment plant wwtp in the south of france the raw landfill leachate was initially treated in a mbr then followed by a nf step the concentrate from the nf step was collected and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c 2 3 electrochemical setup and electrode materials experiments were conducted in an undivided cylindrical glass containing 220 ml of nf concentrate at room temperature 25 c the electrochemical cell was similar to the one used in several previous studies ganiyu et al 2016 trellu et al 2016b either raw cf for homogeneous ef or feiifeiii ldh modified cf for heterogeneous ef was employed as cathode 20 6 cm 120 cm2 positioned on the inner wall of the cylindrical cell cf 99 0 6 35 mm thick was provided by alfa aesar feiifeiii ldh modified cf was prepared by in situ solvothermal process as reported elsewhere ganiyu et al 2018a b ldh coating was 0 62 0 04 mg cm 2 which was also in agreement with what has been reported previously ganiyu et al 2018a b for homogeneous ef experiments 0 2 mm of fe2 was added to the solution and initial ph was adjusted at 3 values usually reported as optimal for heterogeneous ef experiments none fe2 was externally added and ph was not initally adjusted the anode was either a 24 cm2 3 8 cm platinum mesh for homogeneous and heterogeneous ef or a 32 cm2 4 8 cm ti4o7 thin film plasma deposited on ti substrate for heterogeneous ef ao from saint gobain research provence france ti4o7 powder used for plasma deposition was prepared by carbothermal reduction of tio2 as already reported by our group ganiyu et al 2016 2017b these rectuganlar shaped anodes were placed at the center of the cylindrical electrochemical cell with an average interelectrode distance of 3 cm electrodes were connected to a dc power supply cnb electronique with applied current set at 1000 ma j 8 3 ma cm 2 calcultated from the cathode surface which is the working electrode during the ef process or 500 ma j 4 2 ma cm 2 a magnetic stirrer was used to improve mass transport of chemical species toward from the electrodes the solution was saturated with o2 by bubbling compressed air through a glass frit 10 min before starting the experiments and all along the electrolysis the conductivity of the nf concentrate was high enough to ensure the electrolysis without any additional supporting electrolyte for comparison a reference experiment was also carried out using raw carbon felt cathode pt anode without adding any source of iron and without initial ph adjustment 2 4 dissolved organic carbon and chemical oxygen demand analysis mineralization rate of nf concentrate was determined by total organic carbon toc analyses using the shimadzu toc l analyzer based on the 680 c combustion catalytic oxidation method all samples were filtrated through 0 45 μm regenerated cellulose rc membrane filters therefore results are reported as dissolved organic carbon doc chemical oxygen demand cod was analyzed by the method afnor nft 90 101 using hach cod kits 2 5 respirometric method for the determination of biodegradability biodegradability was assessed with a bm t advance respirometer surcis s l spain which consists in a 1 l capacity vessel provided with an oxygen probe hamilton and temperature control system the activated sludge used in the bioassays was collected from the aerated tank of the landfill leachate wwtp using mbr and was thus acclimatized to the effluent the samples were evaluated without ph adjustment because of the high buffer capacity of the landfill leachate samples continuous aeration and agitation were applied to ensure air saturation conditions temperature was maintained at 20 c during the tests and the standardization with sodium acetate method was applied conversion rate adjustment according to instructions given by the respirometer s manufacturer in order to inhibit the nitrification process and measure the sample effect only on the heterotrophic bacteria 1 5 mg gvss 1 of n allylthiourea was added before the beginning of each trial for biodegradability assays 700 ml of endogenous activated sludge and 300 ml of target sample were introduced in the respirometer the biodegradability of samples pre treated by eaops was assessed through r tests fig si 1 the ratio between biodegradable cod bcod and doc bcod doc was used for determination of the biodegradable character of each sample a biodegradability enhancement index be was calculated by using eq 5 5 be b c o d t d o c t b c o d 0 d o c 0 where bcodt and doct are bcod in go2 l 1 and doc in gc l 1 after t hours of treatment by eaops 2 6 characterization of dissolved organic matter by three dimensional excitation and emission matrix fluorescence 3deem natural organic matter was characterized by 3deem fluorescence using a perkinelmer ls 55 spectrometer usa the dilution factor was 200 for all samples the procedure reported by jacquin et al 2017 was used for fluorescence spectra acquisition and data extraction chen et al 2003 divided fluorescence spectra into five different areas corresponding to different groups of fluorophores i e regions i and ii for aromatic proteins region iii for fulvic acid like fa like fluorophores region iv for soluble microbial by product like smp like fluorophores and region v for humic acid like ha like fluorophores chen et al 2003 similarly to the study of jacquin et al 2017 3deem results were analyzed by taking into consideration only 3 different zones i e zone i for region i ii aromatic proteins zone ii for region iv smp like and zone iii for region iii v ha fa like calculation of the volume of fluorescence in these different zones was achieved following the method from jacquin et al 2017 the procedures for icp ms analysis toxicity test microtox identification quantification of inorganic ions and identification quantification of short chain carboxylic acids are provided in supplementary information si 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the nf concentrate effluent the characteristics of the nf concentrate are presented in si table si 1 the effluent was a dark brown liquid having a slightly alkaline ph and high organic charge the conductivity 3 1 ms cm 1 was between 3 and 10 times lower than values reported in the literature 10 33 ms cm 1 li et al 2015 hu et al 2018 xu et al 2017 this might be ascribed to the high diversity of landfill leachate and to a lower retention of ionic species by the nf step in fact the concentration factor of divalent mg2 and ca2 and monovalent na and k inorganic cations was only 3 1 0 3 and 1 7 0 2 respectively monovalent ions are less retained by the nf membrane because of lower charge interactions van der bruggen et al 2004 the cod content 2 1 go2 l 1 of the nf concentrate was also in the low range of values usually reported in the literature 1 7 5 5 go2 l 1 li et al 2015 hu et al 2018 xu et al 2017 because of i operation of the nf process with a lower concentration factor and or ii lower initial organic loading rate of the effluent pre treated by the mbr the ratio between bcod and total cod or total doc was low bcod cod 0 12 or bcod doc 0 26 thus indicating the low biodegradability of the concentrate owing to the presence of high molecular weight and non biodegradable compounds a high concentration of nitrate no3 90 mg l 1 was observed due to the complete nitrification of nh4 in the mbr and a partial denitrification in the anoxic tank as regards to metals sr ion was the most concentrated 6 0 mg l 1 and high concentrations of as 0 38 mg l 1 and cr 0 67 mg l 1 ions were also reported these metals are released by different wastes discarded in landfills such as glass products ponthieu et al 2007 fluorescent lights and ceramics mahindrakar and rathod 2018 besides the high concentration of sb 1 2 mg l 1 indicates an important contamination from plastic decomposition westerhoff et al 2008 3 2 mineralization efficiency by eaops various experiments were performed in order to evaluate the efficiency of different eaops i e homogeneous ef heterogeneous ef heterogeneous ef ao first volatilization and adsorption phenomena were evidenced by bubbling oxygen into the electrochemical reactor without any current applied under these conditions doc content decreased and reached a plateau after 1 h with around 16 2 removal due to volatilization of volatile organic compounds and adsorption of hydrophobic compounds on cf besides it was also observed that initial ph adjustment at 3 decreased the doc value by 15 5 because of the precipitation of humic acids second experiments were carried out under constant current density applied to the electrodes as shown in fig 1 a 96 of doc removal was obtained after 8 h of electrolysis by heterogeneous ef with an applied current density of 8 3 ma cm 2 the excellent mineralization efficiency achieved without any initial ph adjustment was ascribed to heterogeneous ef reaction occurring on the surface of the feiifeiii ldh catalyst which catalyzed the decomposition of h2o2 to generate large amounts of hydroxyl radicals oh ganiyu et al 2018a b by comparison only 59 removal of doc was obtained in the reference experiment with analogous operating conditions but using raw cf as cathode instead of feiifeiii ldh modified cf thus highlighting the benefits obtained from the use of the modified cathode heterogeneous ef was also even more efficient than conventional homogeneous ef 90 removal of doc after 8 h with external addition of iron catalyst 0 2 mmol l 1 and initial adjustment of ph at 3 therefore feiifeiii ldh modified cf appeared as an ideal cathode material that enhances the mineralization efficiency of the ef process and avoids both initial ph adjustment and external addition of iron the stability and reusability of the prepared feiifeiii ldh modified cf cathode was assessed by reusing the same electrode for 4 successive electrolysis cycles fig 2 the slight but continuous decrease of the efficiency could be ascribed to i the initial loss of loosely bounded feiifeiii ldh at the external surface of the cf substrate due to vigorous stirring and or ii iron leaching at acidic ph for which feiifeiii ldh coating is less stable indeed a progressive reduction of ph to values in the range 3 4 was noticed during electrolysis which was explained by the generation of short chain carboxylic acids this leaching phenomenon was confirmed by comparison of sem images of raw cf feiifeiii ldh modified cf before use and feiifeiii ldh modified cf after 4 cycles of electrolysis fig si 2 while an extensive growth on the cf of dense platelets of feiifeiii ldh with uneven and porous structure was initially obtained a partial degradation of the global feiifeiii ldh structure was observed after 4 cycles thus in order to avoid the depletion of the catalyst a continuous ph control regulation would be recommended rather than a unique ph re adjustment at the end of the treatment third experiments were also performed at lower current density 4 2 ma cm 2 fig 1b lower doc removal rates were obtained e g 72 vs 96 removal of doc after 8 h of treatment by heterogeneous ef at 4 2 ma cm 2 and 8 3 ma cm 2 respectively indeed high current density enhances the generation of hydrogen peroxide and regeneration rate of fe ii thus further oh are produced for oxidation and mineralization of organic compounds fourth the influence of the anode material was also investigated fig 1b after 8h of treatment by heterogeneous ef ao using ti4o7 anode at 4 2 ma cm 2 77 removal of doc was achieved compared to 72 by heterogeneous ef using pt anode the higher efficiency of ti4o7 anode was ascribed to the generation at the anode surface of physisorbed ti4o7 oh with great oxidation ability because of the higher overvoltage for oxygen evolution reaction 0 7 v compared to pt anode 0 4 v trellu et al 2018a ganiyu et al 2018a b therefore by taking also into consideration the lower cost of ti4o7 this anode material appeared as a suitable electrode to combine ao and ef processes one of the main challenges for eaops is to reduce the energy consumption ec the ec was expressed as kwh per g of doc removed and calculated from eq 6 brillas et al 2009 6 e c d o c kwh g 1 of doc e c e l l i t v δ d o c e x p where ecell is the average cell voltage v i the applied current a t the duration of electrolysis h v the volume of solution treated l and δ doc exp the experimental decays of doc mgc l 1 for example 96 removal of doc by heterogeneous ef at 8 3 ma cm 2 required 0 35 kwh g 1 of doc removed by comparison 77 doc removal by heterogeneous ef ao using ti4o7 anode at 4 2 ma cm 2 required only 0 13 kwh g 1 of doc this value decreased to 0 11 kwh g 1 of doc for 45 removal of doc by the same process 4 h of treatment instead of 8 h in fact high current density strongly increased energy consumption because of concomitant rise in total cell voltage from 7 2 to 10 4 v parasitic reaction such as hydrogen evolution 4 e reduction of o2 to h2o and 2 e oxidation of water to o2 are also promoted at higher current density moreover at high removal rate of doc and low residual doc the current efficiency is strongly decreased by mass transport limitations therefore in order to achieve high doc removal rate with low energy consumption it was proposed to combine eaops with a biological post treatment since eaops are able to transform biorefractory organic compounds into by products that are more biodegradable than initial compounds ganzenko et al 2014 olvera vargas et al 2015 trellu et al 2016a in practice that would mean implementing the eaop as a preliminary treatment before recirculation of the nf concentrate towards the mbr thus the next objective of this study was to monitor the evolution of the biodegradability of the effluent as well as to better understand the evolution of organic and inorganic compounds during eaops 3 3 biodegradability enhancement respirometric measurements performed have the advantage of being a direct and rapid biological assessment of aerobic degradation under similar conditions than in the real industrial mbr reuschenbach et al 2003 the calculated biodegradability enhancement be values are presented in fig 3 after 4 and 8h of treatment for different eaop configurations and current densities applied in all cases heterogeneous ef shows an increase in the biodegradability of the nf concentrate which validate the potenital positive role of eaops as a pre treatment before recirculating the nf concentrate to the mbr in general the more the mineralization rate is achieved the more the biodegradability enhancement is observed after 8 h of treatment by heterogeneous ef at 4 2 ma cm 2 the be index reached 11 with ti4o7 anode compared to 5 9 with pt anode which validate the positive effect of combining ef with ao we could state that a satisfactory biodegradability enhancement between 4 1 and 9 1 was reached after 4 h with optimal energy consumption efficiency 3 4 acute toxicity of the effluent toxicity evolution of the nf concentrate during its electrolysis by both heterogeneous and homogeneous ef was evaluated by microtox standard method fig 4 initially i e before any treatment of the nf concentrate around 50 5 of v fischeri luminescence inhibition was observed because of the presence of large amount of toxic trace metals and organic pollutants v fischeri luminescence inhibition can be sensitive to various phenomena that can not be controlled and studied separately during the treatment of such complex effluent e g the removal of toxic organic pollutants the formation of toxic degradation by products the formation of non toxic degradation by products which could promote stimulation of bacterial luminescence the release of inorganic compounds and the evolution of metal speciation therefore it is difficult to draw reliable conclusions from these analyses however results show that eaops are not able to remove completely the acute toxicity from such complex effluent containing both organic and inorganic toxic compounds luminescence inhibtion might even increases significantly particularly after achieving high mineralization rates for example during heterogeneous ef at 8 3 ma cm 2 and heterogeneous ef at 4 2 ma cm 2 from the comparison of heterogeneous ef experiments performed with either pt or ti4o7 anode it seems that anodic oxidation participate to avoid the accumulation of toxic by products in the bulk 3 5 characterization of the organic matter by 3deem 3deem has been reported to be a useful tool for characterization of colloidal and dissolved organic matter particularly jacquin et al 2017 recently emphasized a correlation between the volume of fluorescence of zone iii ha fa like fluorophores and the concentration in a full scale mbr of humic substances mw 1000 da and building blocks degradation by products from humic substances with mw 300 500 da measured by size exclusion liquid chromatography coupled with organic carbon and organic nitrogen detector similarly a correlation was also obtained between the volume of fluorescence of zone ii smp like fluorophores and the concentration of proteins from biopolymers mw 20 000 7 5 1011 da besides no correlation was obtained for the volume of fluorescence of zone i because fluorophores of this zone would be mostly associated with colloidal proteins that could not be analyzed by size exclusion liquid chromatography jacquin et al 2017 in this study we proposed to use these results with the view to obtain indications on the evolution of the nature of the organic matter during eaops the initial effluent was mainly constituted of ha fa like fluorophores from zone iii as shown in fig 5 a and b this result is consistent with the pre treatment of the effluent in the mbr because microfiltration membranes have lower retention capacity for these low mw compounds a strong decrease of fluorophores of zone iii was then observed during both heterogeneous ef fig 5c and ef ao fig 5d due to i precipitation of humic acids at acidic ph and ii fast degradation and mineralization of these low mw compounds with an aromatic structure that reacts quickly with oh trellu et al 2016b by comparison fluorescence from colloidal proteins of zone i decreased much more slowly this phenomenon might be ascribed to the lower availability of colloids for reaction with oh in the aqueous phase in the context of the global combined process this result means that improving the retention of colloidal proteins in the mbr would then have a positive effect on the efficiency of the eaop finally it was also observed that the use of ti4o7 anode for the heterogeneous ao ef process promoted significantly the decrease of the fluorescence of proteins from biopolymers zone ii fig 5d this might be ascribed to the higher electro catalytic activity of ti4o7 for anodic oxidation of organic compounds compared to pt anode ganiyu et al 2016 3 6 identification and quantification of short chain carboxylic acids short chain carboxylic acids are common degradation by products generated during the degradation of organic compounds by eaops oturan et al 2008 in this study they were identified by ion exclusion hplc and chromatograms revealed five well defined peaks corresponding to acetic formic succinic malonic and oxamic acids results were firstly analyzed by following the evolution of the concentration of the sum of carboxylic acids analyzed the evolution of the concentration according to treatment time was determined for homogeneous ef at 8 3 ma cm 2 an initial increase of the concentration was observed until t 6 h σ carboxylic acids 55 mgc l 1 because of the degradation of aromatic pollutants then the concentration decreased σ carboxylic acids 34 mgc l 1 at t 8 h in fact the lower concentration of organic compounds after 6 h of treatment resulted in lower formation rate of carboxylic acids compared to the degradation rate interestingly fig 6 a shows a linear correlation r2 0 92 between doc removal and proportion of carboxylic acids among the residual doc this correlation took into consideration all analyzes performed for the different configurations tested the higher the doc removal achieved the higher was the proportion of carboxylic acids among the residual doc this result is consistent with the lower reaction rate constant of short chain carboxylic acids with oh 107 108 m 1 s 1 compared to aromatic compounds 109 1010 m 1 s 1 from which they are formed oturan et al 2008 the evolution of the proportion of each single carboxylic acid was also studied fig 6b it was noticed that the proportion of acetic acid among total carboxylic acid concentration was continuously increased over time during homogeneous ef at 8 3 ma cm 2 this phenomenon is also consistent with the lower reaction rate constant of acetic acid with oh 1 6 107 m 1 s 1 compared to other carboxylic acids oturan et al 2008 similar trend was observed after 8 h of electrolysis using heterogeneous ef at 8 3 ma cm 2 or 4 2 ma cm 2 and homogeneous ef at 4 2 ma cm 2 i e the higher the doc removal rate fig 1 the higher the proportion of acetic acid heterogeneous ef ao using ti4o7 was the only experiment exhibiting a different trend thus indicating that ti4o7 might modify mineralization mechanisms compared to pt anode higher proportion of n containing oxamic acid and lower proportion of acetic acid were observed with ti4o7 anode which might be attributed to the better electro catalytic ability of ti4o7 anode for the degradation of organic nitrogen and acetic acid compared to pt anode as regards to oxamic acid these results were consistent with 3deem in fact ti4o7 anode further degraded proteins from biopolymers zone ii which usually contain high concentration of n ratio c n around 3 jacquin et al 2017 overall the increase of the proportion of carboxylic acids over time confirms the suitability of the combination of eaops with a biological treatment fig 3 because of the well known high biodegradability of such compounds 3 7 evolution of inorganic species mineralization of cl and n containing organic compounds was accompanied by the formation of inorganic ions the main inorganic species of interest no3 nh4 clo3 and clo4 were analyzed by ion chromatography results are presented in fig 7 in all experiments a stronger increase of the concentration of nh4 was observed compared to no3 fig 7a and b these results can be explained by i the direct release of nh4 from mineralization of organic nitrogen and ii the release of no3 followed by reduction of no3 into nh4 at the cathode actually the latter reaction is often observed during ef and ao while oxidation of nh4 at the anode is hindered by the positive charge of this ion martin de vidales et al 2016 mousset et al 2018 the amount of nh4 in the solution increased with treatment time and current density because of the higher mineralization rate of organic nitrogen fig 7b higher concentration of nh4 was also obtained using ti4o7 anode heterogeneous ef ao compared to pt anode heterogeneous ef this phenomenon is consistent with the results obtained from 3deem and with the higher concentration of oxamic acid previously reported and supports the higher electro catalytic activity of ti4o7 for the degradation of organic nitrogen in the context of a treatment strategy including a recirculation of the effluent back to the mbr the release of nh4 during eaops would require further biological nitrification in the mbr oxidation of cl resulted in a strong increase of clo3 concentration fig 7c the reaction mechanisms usually go through cl oxidation into cl2 followed by hydrolysis of cl2 into hypochlorous acid hocl further oxidation of hocl lead to the formation of clo2 which was not detected because of the fast oxidation kinetic and subsequently clo3 no formation of clo4 was detected in any experiment because higher current density 30 ma cm 2 is required to form this compound mousset et al 2018 besides it was also observed that the formation of clo3 mainly occurred between 4 and 8 h of treatment most probably because of the preferential reaction of hocl with organic species and nh4 break point chlorination between 4 and 8 h of treatment martin de vidales et al 2016 mousset et al 2018 these results confirm the suitability to stop the treatment after 4 h of treatment in order to avoid the accumulation of clo3 and nh4 while clo3 can be toxic for the biomass in the mbr the formation of nh3 at basic ph is also highly toxic for the autotrophic biomass jacquin et al 2018 4 conclusion nf concentrate of landfill leachate pre treated in a mbr contains high concentration of biorefractory organic pollutants that makes very difficult to treat or detoxify by conventional techniques the investigation of different configurations of eaops applied to this complex effluent showed that heterogeneous ef ao using ti4o7 anode and feiifeiii ldh modified cf cathode is the most efficient process for mineralization of organic pollutants without initial ph adjustment and external addition of fe2 in the bulk 45 removal of doc was achieved at 4 2 ma cm 2 with limited energy consumption 0 11 kwh g 1 of doc removed i e 49 5 kwh m 3 up to 96 removal of doc was also obtained by using higher current density 8 3 ma cm 2 during the heterogeneous ef process the use of ti4o7 anode appeared to be a key parameter for improving the degradation and mineralization of organic nitrogen from 3deem analysis colloidal proteins were observed to be the most refractory organic compounds therefore improving the retention of such compounds in the mbr could improve the efficiency of the eaop the acute toxicity of the effluent was not removed but strong biodegradability enhancement was observed after 4 h of treatment by heterogeneous ef ao thus making possible the recirculation of the residual doc towards the mbr in order to achieve total cod removal without longer electrochemical treatment time this result was consistent with the identification and quantification of more biodegradable and less toxic by products such as carboxylic acids in fact a linear correlation was observed between doc removal rate and proportion of carboxylic acids in the residual doc as regards to the fate of inorganic

nitrogen overall these results emphasized the interdependence between the mbr process and the eaop in a combined treatment strategy and demonstrated that the use of eaops using suitable electrode

18663,the objective of this study was to implement electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops for mineralization and biodegradability enhancement of nanofiltration nf concentrate from landfill leachate initially pre treated in a membrane bioreactor mbr raw carbon felt cf or feiifeiii layered double hydroxides modified cf were used for comparing the efficiency of homogeneous and heterogeneous electro fenton ef respectively the highest mineralization rate was obtained by heterogeneous ef 96 removal of dissolved organic carbon doc was achieved after 8 h of electrolysis at circumneutral initial ph ph0 7 9 and at 8 3 ma cm 2 however the most efficient treatment strategy appeared to be heterogeneous ef at 4 2 ma cm 2 combined with anodic oxidation using ti4o7 anode energy consumption 0 11 kwh g 1 of doc removed respirometric analyses under similar conditions than in the real mbr emphasized the possibility to recirculate the nf retentate towards the mbr after partial mineralization by eaops in order to remove the residual biodegradable by products and improve the global cost effectiveness of the process further analyses were also performed in order to better understand the fate of organic and inorganic species during the treatment including acute toxicity tests microtox characterization of dissolved organic matter by three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy evolution of inorganic ions clo3 nh4 and no3 and identification quantification of degradation by products such as carboxylic acids the obtained results emphasized the interdependence between the mbr process and eaops in a combined treatment strategy improving the retention in the mbr of colloidal proteins would improve the effectiveness of eaops because such compounds were identified as the most refractory enhanced nitrification would be also required in the mbr because of the release of nh4 from mineralization of refractory organic nitrogen during eaops graphical

represents a significant hazard for the environment the implementation of a membrane bioreactor mbr followed by a nanofiltration nf step is one of the most efficient treatment strategy currently used for management of landfill leachates campagna et al 2013 amaral et al 2016 however nf is only a separation process biorefractory organic pollutants are accumulated and concentrated thus the concentrate becomes an important residual issue for this treatment strategy van der bruggen et al 2003 zhang et al 2009 2013 landfill discharge of the concentrate is commonly performed however some national regulations do not allow such practice and it clearly does not fix the long term issue in recent years several processes have been investigated and applied at industrial scale for the treatment of nf concentrate for example adsorption processes are effective to remove organic matters in nf concentrate but they are strongly limited by the high organic charge of such effluents compared to the adsorption capacity of adsorbent materials besides membrane distillation and evaporation processes are substantially limited by the high cost of equipment and energy consumption cui et al 2018 during the last two decades electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have received great attention for efficient degradation of a large range of hazardous and biorefractory organic compounds they are based on in situ electrogeneration of hydroxyl radicals oh a non selective and powerful oxidizing agent e oh h2o 2 80 v vs she brillas et al 2009 comninellis et al 2008 martínez huitle et al 2015 panizza and cerisola 2009 eaops provide also several technical advantages such as high versatility easy operation possibility for automation and low consumption of chemical reagents radjenovic and sedlak 2015 sirés et al 2014 however complete mineralization of organic compounds requires high energy consumption therefore the combination of eaops with biological processes is currently more and more investigated as a feasible option for improving the global cost effectiveness of the process oller et al 2011 ganzenko et al 2014 2018 trellu et al 2016a olvera vargas et al 2015 in order to achieve reliable conclusions the accurate assessment of biodegradability enhancement by eaops requires the use of proper measurement tools such as respirometric methods reuschenbach et al 2003 anodic oxidation ao and electro fenton ef are the most popularized eaops brillas et al 2009 panizza and cerisola 2009 martínez huitle et al 2015 oturan et al 2015 ao is based on the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh via water oxidation at the surface of anodes m with high overvoltage for oxygen evolution reaction eq 1 panizza and cerisola 2009 trellu et al 2017 özcan et al 2008

electrogenerated at the cathode by reduction of dissolved oxygen eq 3 and iron iii reduction eq 4 respectively external oxygen supply is required and an iron source must be either initially added at

homogeneous ef requires external iron source and acidic ph i e ph 2 5 3 5 that prevents iron precipitation brillas et al 2009 besides heterogeneous ef using for example pyrite ammar et al 2015 or iron loaded sepiolite iglesias et al 2013 as iron source has been developed in order to operate the process over a wide ph range ganiyu et al 2018a b poza nogueiras et al 2018 innovative electrodes have been also synthesized and studied as both heterogeneous catalyst source and cathode materials zhang et al 2012 wang et al 2013 garcía rodríguez et al 2016 ganiyu et al 2017a particularly the modification of raw carbon felt cf with cofe or feiifeiii layered double hydroxide ldh also led to an increase of the electroactive surface area which in turn improved the generation of h2o2 and the global efficiency of the heterogeneous ef process ganiyu et al 2017a 2018a b however to the best of our knowledge none study focused on the application of such promising electrodes for the treatment of real wastewaters as regards to anode materials sub stoichiometric titanium oxides especially ti4o7 recently received great attention for application in wastewater treatment by ao guo et al 2016 ganiyu et al 2016 trellu et al 2018b ti4o7 anode is able to generate large amounts of physisorbed hydroxyl radicals ti4o7 oh for the degradation and mineralization of organic contaminants besides this material has the potential to become a low cost anode compared to the well known boron doped diamond anode ganiyu et al 2017b trellu et al 2018b however to the best of our knowledge such anode material has also still not been applied for the treatment of real effluents the objective of this study was to investigate the application of these novel electrode materials for the treatment of a nf concentrate of landfill leachate initially pre treated in a mbr which represents an important challenge for environmental engineering various configurations i e homogeneous ef heterogeneous ef heterogeneous ef ao and operating conditions were studied the efficiency for mineralization of organic compounds was compared a particular attention was also given to the understanding of mineralization mechanisms by using various analytical tools i dom was characterized by three dimensional excitation and emission matrix fluorescence 3deem ii degradation by products such as short chain carboxylic acids were identified and quantified by ion exclusion hplc and iii inorganic ions released during the mineralization process were identified and quantified by ion chromatography moreover acute toxicity of the effluent was assessed by microtox analysis and the possibility to use such eaops as a pre treatment before recirculation towards the mbr was assessed by using respirometric method under similar conditions than in the real industrial mbr finally recommendations were given by taking into consideration the interdependence of mbr process and eaop in a combined treatment strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals for the preparation of feiifeiii ldh modified cf iron iii nitrate nonahydrate fe no3 3 9h2o cas 7782 61 8 98 purity iron ii sulfate

resistivity 18 mω cm at 25 c was used for the preparation of all solutions 2 2 landfill leachate nf concentrate the nf concentrate was collected from a landfill leachate wastewater treatment plant wwtp in the south of france the raw landfill leachate was initially treated in a mbr then followed by a nf step the concentrate from the nf step was collected and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c 2 3 electrochemical setup and electrode materials experiments were conducted in an undivided cylindrical glass containing 220 ml of nf concentrate at room temperature 25 c the electrochemical cell was similar to the one used in several previous studies ganiyu et al 2016 trellu et al 2016b either raw cf for homogeneous ef or feiifeiii ldh modified cf for heterogeneous ef was employed as cathode 20 6 cm 120 cm2 positioned on the inner wall of the cylindrical cell cf 99 0 6 35 mm thick was provided by alfa aesar feiifeiii ldh modified cf was prepared by in situ solvothermal process as reported elsewhere ganiyu et al 2018a b ldh coating was 0 62 0 04 mg cm 2 which was also in agreement with what has been reported previously ganiyu et al 2018a b for homogeneous ef experiments 0 2 mm of fe2 was added to the solution and initial ph was adjusted at 3 values usually reported as optimal for heterogeneous ef experiments none fe2 was externally added and ph was not initally adjusted the anode was either a 24 cm2 3 8 cm platinum mesh for homogeneous and heterogeneous ef or a 32 cm2 4 8 cm ti4o7 thin film plasma deposited on ti substrate for heterogeneous ef ao from saint gobain research provence france ti4o7 powder used for plasma deposition was prepared by carbothermal reduction of tio2 as already reported by our group ganiyu et al 2016 2017b these rectuganlar shaped anodes were placed at the center of the cylindrical electrochemical cell with an average interelectrode distance of 3 cm electrodes were connected to a dc power supply cnb electronique with applied current set at 1000 ma j 8 3 ma cm 2 calcultated from the cathode surface which is the working electrode during the ef process or 500 ma j 4 2 ma cm 2 a magnetic stirrer was used to improve mass transport of chemical species toward from the electrodes the solution was saturated with o2 by bubbling compressed air through a glass frit 10 min before starting the experiments and all along the electrolysis the conductivity of the nf concentrate was high enough to ensure the electrolysis without any additional supporting electrolyte for comparison a reference experiment was also carried out using raw carbon felt cathode pt anode without adding any source of iron and without initial ph adjustment 2 4 dissolved organic carbon and chemical oxygen demand analysis mineralization rate of nf concentrate was determined by total organic carbon toc analyses using the shimadzu toc l analyzer based on the 680 c combustion catalytic oxidation method all samples were filtrated through 0 45 μm regenerated cellulose rc membrane filters therefore results are reported as dissolved organic carbon doc chemical oxygen demand cod was analyzed by the method afnor nft 90 101 using hach cod kits 2 5 respirometric method for the determination of biodegradability biodegradability was assessed with a bm t advance respirometer surcis s l spain which consists in a 1 l capacity vessel provided with an oxygen probe hamilton and temperature control system the activated sludge used in the bioassays was collected from the aerated tank of the landfill leachate wwtp using mbr and was thus acclimatized to the effluent the samples were evaluated without ph adjustment because of the high buffer capacity of the landfill leachate samples continuous aeration and agitation were applied to ensure air saturation conditions temperature was maintained at 20 c during the tests and the standardization with sodium acetate method was applied conversion rate adjustment according to instructions given by the respirometer s manufacturer in order to inhibit the nitrification process and measure the sample effect only on the heterotrophic bacteria 1 5 mg gvss 1 of n allylthiourea was added before the beginning of each trial for biodegradability assays 700 ml of endogenous activated sludge and 300 ml of target sample were introduced in the respirometer the biodegradability of samples pre treated by eaops was assessed through r tests fig si 1 the ratio between biodegradable cod bcod and doc bcod doc was used for determination of the biodegradable character of each sample a biodegradability enhancement index be was calculated by using eq 5 5 be b c o d t d o c t b c o d 0 d o c 0 where bcodt and doct are bcod in go2 l 1 and doc in gc l 1 after t hours of treatment by eaops 2 6 characterization of dissolved organic matter by three dimensional excitation and emission matrix fluorescence 3deem natural organic matter was characterized by 3deem fluorescence using a perkinelmer ls 55 spectrometer usa the dilution factor was 200 for all samples the procedure reported by jacquin et al 2017 was used for fluorescence spectra acquisition and data extraction chen et al 2003 divided fluorescence spectra into five different areas corresponding to different groups of fluorophores i e regions i and ii for aromatic proteins region iii for fulvic acid like fa like fluorophores region iv for soluble microbial by product like smp like fluorophores and region v for humic acid like ha like fluorophores chen et al 2003 similarly to the study of jacquin et al 2017 3deem results were analyzed by taking into consideration only 3 different zones i e zone i for region i ii aromatic proteins zone ii for region iv smp like and zone iii for region iii v ha fa like calculation of the volume of fluorescence in these different zones was achieved following the method from jacquin et al 2017 the procedures for icp ms analysis toxicity test microtox identification quantification of inorganic ions and identification quantification of short chain carboxylic acids are provided in supplementary information si 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the nf concentrate effluent the characteristics of the nf concentrate are presented in si table si 1 the effluent was a dark brown liquid having a slightly alkaline ph and high organic charge the conductivity 3 1 ms cm 1 was between 3 and 10 times lower than values reported in the literature 10 33 ms cm 1 li et al 2015 hu et al 2018 xu et al 2017 this might be ascribed to the high diversity of landfill leachate and to a lower retention of ionic species by the nf step in fact the concentration factor of divalent mg2 and ca2 and monovalent na and k inorganic cations was only 3 1 0 3 and 1 7 0 2 respectively monovalent ions are less retained by the nf membrane because of lower charge interactions van der bruggen et al 2004 the cod content 2 1 go2 l 1 of the nf concentrate was also in the low range of values usually reported in the literature 1 7 5 5 go2 l 1 li et al 2015 hu et al 2018 xu et al 2017 because of i operation of the nf process with a lower concentration factor and or ii lower initial organic loading rate of the effluent pre treated by the mbr the ratio between bcod and total cod or total doc was low bcod cod 0 12 or bcod doc 0 26 thus indicating the low biodegradability of the concentrate owing to the presence of high molecular weight and non biodegradable compounds a high concentration of nitrate no3 90 mg l 1 was observed due to the complete nitrification of nh4 in the mbr and a partial denitrification in the anoxic tank as regards to metals sr ion was the most concentrated 6 0 mg l 1 and high concentrations of as 0 38 mg l 1 and cr 0 67 mg l 1 ions were also reported these metals are released by different wastes discarded in landfills such as glass products ponthieu et al 2007 fluorescent lights and ceramics mahindrakar and rathod 2018 besides the high concentration of sb 1 2 mg l 1 indicates an important contamination from plastic decomposition westerhoff et al 2008 3 2 mineralization efficiency by eaops various experiments were performed in order to evaluate the efficiency of different eaops i e homogeneous ef heterogeneous ef heterogeneous ef ao first volatilization and adsorption phenomena were evidenced by bubbling oxygen into the electrochemical reactor without any current applied under these conditions doc content decreased and reached a plateau after 1 h with around 16 2 removal due to volatilization of volatile organic compounds and adsorption of hydrophobic compounds on cf besides it was also observed that initial ph adjustment at 3 decreased the doc value by 15 5 because of the precipitation of humic acids second experiments were carried out under constant current density applied to the electrodes as shown in fig 1 a 96 of doc removal was obtained after 8 h of electrolysis by heterogeneous ef with an applied current density of 8 3 ma cm 2 the excellent mineralization efficiency achieved without any initial ph adjustment was ascribed to heterogeneous ef reaction occurring on the surface of the feiifeiii ldh catalyst which catalyzed the decomposition of h2o2 to generate large amounts of hydroxyl radicals oh ganiyu et al 2018a b by comparison only 59 removal of doc was obtained in the reference experiment with analogous operating conditions but using raw cf as cathode instead of feiifeiii ldh modified cf thus highlighting the benefits obtained from the use of the modified cathode heterogeneous ef was also even more efficient than conventional homogeneous ef 90 removal of doc after 8 h with external addition of iron catalyst 0 2 mmol l 1 and initial adjustment of ph at 3 therefore feiifeiii ldh modified cf appeared as an ideal cathode material that enhances the mineralization efficiency of the ef process and avoids both initial ph adjustment and external addition of iron the stability and reusability of the prepared feiifeiii ldh modified cf cathode was assessed by reusing the same electrode for 4 successive electrolysis cycles fig 2 the slight but continuous decrease of the efficiency could be ascribed to i the initial loss of loosely bounded feiifeiii ldh at the external surface of the cf substrate due to vigorous stirring and or ii iron leaching at acidic ph for which feiifeiii ldh coating is less stable indeed a progressive reduction of ph to values in the range 3 4 was noticed during electrolysis which was explained by the generation of short chain carboxylic acids this leaching phenomenon was confirmed by comparison of sem images of raw cf feiifeiii ldh modified cf before use and feiifeiii ldh modified cf after 4 cycles of electrolysis fig si 2 while an extensive growth on the cf of dense platelets of feiifeiii ldh with uneven and porous structure was initially obtained a partial degradation of the global feiifeiii ldh structure was observed after 4 cycles thus in order to avoid the depletion of the catalyst a continuous ph control regulation would be recommended rather than a unique ph re adjustment at the end of the treatment third experiments were also performed at lower current density 4 2 ma cm 2 fig 1b lower doc removal rates were obtained e g 72 vs 96 removal of doc after 8 h of treatment by heterogeneous ef at 4 2 ma cm 2 and 8 3 ma cm 2 respectively indeed high current density enhances the generation of hydrogen peroxide and regeneration rate of fe ii thus further oh are produced for oxidation and mineralization of organic compounds fourth the influence of the anode material was also investigated fig 1b after 8h of treatment by heterogeneous ef ao using ti4o7 anode at 4 2 ma cm 2 77 removal of doc was achieved compared to 72 by heterogeneous ef using pt anode the higher efficiency of ti4o7 anode was ascribed to the generation at the anode surface of physisorbed ti4o7 oh with great oxidation ability because of the higher overvoltage for oxygen evolution reaction 0 7 v compared to pt anode 0 4 v trellu et al 2018a ganiyu et al 2018a b therefore by taking also into consideration the lower cost of ti4o7 this anode material appeared as a suitable electrode to combine ao and ef processes one of the main challenges for eaops is to reduce the energy consumption ec the ec was expressed as kwh per g of doc removed and calculated from eq 6 brillas et al 2009 6 e c d o c kwh g 1 of doc e c e l l i t v δ d o c e x p where ecell is the average cell voltage v i the applied current a t the duration of electrolysis h v the volume of solution treated l and δ doc exp the experimental decays of doc mgc l 1 for example 96 removal of doc by heterogeneous ef at 8 3 ma cm 2 required 0 35 kwh g 1 of doc removed by comparison 77 doc removal by heterogeneous ef ao using ti4o7 anode at 4 2 ma cm 2 required only 0 13 kwh g 1 of doc this value decreased to 0 11 kwh g 1 of doc for 45 removal of doc by the same process 4 h of treatment instead of 8 h in fact high current density strongly increased energy consumption because of concomitant rise in total cell voltage from 7 2 to 10 4 v parasitic reaction such as hydrogen evolution 4 e reduction of o2 to h2o and 2 e oxidation of water to o2 are also promoted at higher current density moreover at high removal rate of doc and low residual doc the current efficiency is strongly decreased by mass transport limitations therefore in order to achieve high doc removal rate with low energy consumption it was proposed to combine eaops with a biological post treatment since eaops are able to transform biorefractory organic compounds into by products that are more biodegradable than initial compounds ganzenko et al 2014 olvera vargas et al 2015 trellu et al 2016a in practice that would mean implementing the eaop as a preliminary treatment before recirculation of the nf concentrate towards the mbr thus the next objective of this study was to monitor the evolution of the biodegradability of the effluent as well as to better understand the evolution of organic and inorganic compounds during eaops 3 3 biodegradability enhancement respirometric measurements performed have the advantage of being a direct and rapid biological assessment of aerobic degradation under similar conditions than in the real industrial mbr reuschenbach et al 2003 the calculated biodegradability enhancement be values are presented in fig 3 after 4 and 8h of treatment for different eaop configurations and current densities applied in all cases heterogeneous ef shows an increase in the biodegradability of the nf concentrate which validate the potenital positive role of eaops as a pre treatment before recirculating the nf concentrate to the mbr in general the more the mineralization rate is achieved the more the biodegradability enhancement is observed after 8 h of treatment by heterogeneous ef at 4 2 ma cm 2 the be index reached 11 with ti4o7 anode compared to 5 9 with pt anode which validate the positive effect of combining ef with ao we could state that a satisfactory biodegradability enhancement between 4 1 and 9 1 was reached after 4 h with optimal energy consumption efficiency 3 4 acute toxicity of the effluent toxicity evolution of the nf concentrate during its electrolysis by both heterogeneous and homogeneous ef was evaluated by microtox standard method fig 4 initially i e before any treatment of the nf concentrate around 50 5 of v fischeri luminescence inhibition was observed because of the presence of large amount of toxic trace metals and organic pollutants v fischeri luminescence inhibition can be sensitive to various phenomena that can not be controlled and studied separately during the treatment of such complex effluent e g the removal of toxic organic pollutants the formation of toxic degradation by products the formation of non toxic degradation by products which could promote stimulation of bacterial luminescence the release of inorganic compounds and the evolution of metal speciation therefore it is difficult to draw reliable conclusions from these analyses however results show that eaops are not able to remove completely the acute toxicity from such complex effluent containing both organic and inorganic toxic compounds luminescence inhibtion might even increases significantly particularly after achieving high mineralization rates for example during heterogeneous ef at 8 3 ma cm 2 and heterogeneous ef at 4 2 ma cm 2 from the comparison of heterogeneous ef experiments performed with either pt or ti4o7 anode it seems that anodic oxidation participate to avoid the accumulation of toxic by products in the bulk 3 5 characterization of the organic matter by 3deem 3deem has been reported to be a useful tool for characterization of colloidal and dissolved organic matter particularly jacquin et al 2017 recently emphasized a correlation between the volume of fluorescence of zone iii ha fa like fluorophores and the concentration in a full scale mbr of humic substances mw 1000 da and building blocks degradation by products from humic substances with mw 300 500 da measured by size exclusion liquid chromatography coupled with organic carbon and organic nitrogen detector similarly a correlation was also obtained between the volume of fluorescence of zone ii smp like fluorophores and the concentration of proteins from biopolymers mw 20 000 7 5 1011 da besides no correlation was obtained for the volume of fluorescence of zone i because fluorophores of this zone would be mostly associated with colloidal proteins that could not be analyzed by size exclusion liquid chromatography jacquin et al 2017 in this study we proposed to use these results with the view to obtain indications on the evolution of the nature of the organic matter during eaops the initial effluent was mainly constituted of ha fa like fluorophores from zone iii as shown in fig 5 a and b this result is consistent with the pre treatment of the effluent in the mbr because microfiltration membranes have lower retention capacity for these low mw compounds a strong decrease of fluorophores of zone iii was then observed during both heterogeneous ef fig 5c and ef ao fig 5d due to i precipitation of humic acids at acidic ph and ii fast degradation and mineralization of these low mw compounds with an aromatic structure that reacts quickly with oh trellu et al 2016b by comparison fluorescence from colloidal proteins of zone i decreased much more slowly this phenomenon might be ascribed to the lower availability of colloids for reaction with oh in the aqueous phase in the context of the global combined process this result means that improving the retention of colloidal proteins in the mbr would then have a positive effect on the efficiency of the eaop finally it was also observed that the use of ti4o7 anode for the heterogeneous ao ef process promoted significantly the decrease of the fluorescence of proteins from biopolymers zone ii fig 5d this might be ascribed to the higher electro catalytic activity of ti4o7 for anodic oxidation of organic compounds compared to pt anode ganiyu et al 2016 3 6 identification and quantification of short chain carboxylic acids short chain carboxylic acids are common degradation by products generated during the degradation of organic compounds by eaops oturan et al 2008 in this study they were identified by ion exclusion hplc and chromatograms revealed five well defined peaks corresponding to acetic formic succinic malonic and oxamic acids results were firstly analyzed by following the evolution of the concentration of the sum of carboxylic acids analyzed the evolution of the concentration according to treatment time was determined for homogeneous ef at 8 3 ma cm 2 an initial increase of the concentration was observed until t 6 h σ carboxylic acids 55 mgc l 1 because of the degradation of aromatic pollutants then the concentration decreased σ carboxylic acids 34 mgc l 1 at t 8 h in fact the lower concentration of organic compounds after 6 h of treatment resulted in lower formation rate of carboxylic acids compared to the degradation rate interestingly fig 6 a shows a linear correlation r2 0 92 between doc removal and proportion of carboxylic acids among the residual doc this correlation took into consideration all analyzes performed for the different configurations tested the higher the doc removal achieved the higher was the proportion of carboxylic acids among the residual doc this result is consistent with the lower reaction rate constant of short chain carboxylic acids with oh 107 108 m 1 s 1 compared to aromatic compounds 109 1010 m 1 s 1 from which they are formed oturan et al 2008 the evolution of the proportion of each single carboxylic acid was also studied fig 6b it was noticed that the proportion of acetic acid among total carboxylic acid concentration was continuously increased over time during homogeneous ef at 8 3 ma cm 2 this phenomenon is also consistent with the lower reaction rate constant of acetic acid with oh 1 6 107 m 1 s 1 compared to other carboxylic acids oturan et al 2008 similar trend was observed after 8 h of electrolysis using heterogeneous ef at 8 3 ma cm 2 or 4 2 ma cm 2 and homogeneous ef at 4 2 ma cm 2 i e the higher the doc removal rate fig 1 the higher the proportion of acetic acid heterogeneous ef ao using ti4o7 was the only experiment exhibiting a different trend thus indicating that ti4o7 might modify mineralization mechanisms compared to pt anode higher proportion of n containing oxamic acid and lower proportion of acetic acid were observed with ti4o7 anode which might be attributed to the better electro catalytic ability of ti4o7 anode for the degradation of organic nitrogen and acetic acid compared to pt anode as regards to oxamic acid these results were consistent with 3deem in fact ti4o7 anode further degraded proteins from biopolymers zone ii which usually contain high concentration of n ratio c n around 3 jacquin et al 2017 overall the increase of the proportion of carboxylic acids over time confirms the suitability of the combination of eaops with a biological treatment fig 3 because of the well known high biodegradability of such compounds 3 7 evolution of inorganic species mineralization of cl and n containing organic compounds was accompanied by the formation of inorganic ions the main inorganic species of interest no3 nh4 clo3 and clo4 were analyzed by ion chromatography results are presented in fig 7 in all experiments a stronger increase of the concentration of nh4 was observed compared to no3 fig 7a and b these results can be explained by i the direct release of nh4 from mineralization of organic nitrogen and ii the release of no3 followed by reduction of no3 into nh4 at the cathode actually the latter reaction is often observed during ef and ao while oxidation of nh4 at the anode is hindered by the positive charge of this ion martin de vidales et al 2016 mousset et al 2018 the amount of nh4 in the solution increased with treatment time and current density because of the higher mineralization rate of organic nitrogen fig 7b higher concentration of nh4 was also obtained using ti4o7 anode heterogeneous ef ao compared to pt anode heterogeneous ef this phenomenon is consistent with the results obtained from 3deem and with the higher concentration of oxamic acid previously reported and supports the higher electro catalytic activity of ti4o7 for the degradation of organic nitrogen in the context of a treatment strategy including a recirculation of the effluent back to the mbr the release of nh4 during eaops would require further biological nitrification in the mbr oxidation of cl resulted in a strong increase of clo3 concentration fig 7c the reaction mechanisms usually go through cl oxidation into cl2 followed by hydrolysis of cl2 into hypochlorous acid hocl further oxidation of hocl lead to the formation of clo2 which was not detected because of the fast oxidation kinetic and subsequently clo3 no formation of clo4 was detected in any experiment because higher current density 30 ma cm 2 is required to form this compound mousset et al 2018 besides it was also observed that the formation of clo3 mainly occurred between 4 and 8 h of treatment most probably because of the preferential reaction of hocl with organic species and nh4 break point chlorination between 4 and 8 h of treatment martin de vidales et al 2016 mousset et al 2018 these results confirm the suitability to stop the treatment after 4 h of treatment in order to avoid the accumulation of clo3 and nh4 while clo3 can be toxic for the biomass in the mbr the formation of nh3 at basic ph is also highly toxic for the autotrophic biomass jacquin et al 2018 4 conclusion nf concentrate of landfill leachate pre treated in a mbr contains high concentration of biorefractory organic pollutants that makes very difficult to treat or detoxify by conventional techniques the investigation of different configurations of eaops applied to this complex effluent showed that heterogeneous ef ao using ti4o7 anode and feiifeiii ldh modified cf cathode is the most efficient process for mineralization of organic pollutants without initial ph adjustment and external addition of fe2 in the bulk 45 removal of doc was achieved at 4 2 ma cm 2 with limited energy consumption 0 11 kwh g 1 of doc removed i e 49 5 kwh m 3 up to 96 removal of doc was also obtained by using higher current density 8 3 ma cm 2 during the heterogeneous ef process the use of ti4o7 anode appeared to be a key parameter for improving the degradation and mineralization of organic nitrogen from 3deem analysis colloidal proteins were observed to be the most refractory organic compounds therefore improving the retention of such compounds in the mbr could improve the efficiency of the eaop the acute toxicity of the effluent was not removed but strong biodegradability enhancement was observed after 4 h of treatment by heterogeneous ef ao thus making possible the recirculation of the residual doc towards the mbr in order to achieve total cod removal without longer electrochemical treatment time this result was consistent with the identification and quantification of more biodegradable and less toxic by products such as carboxylic acids in fact a linear correlation was observed between doc removal rate and proportion of carboxylic acids in the residual doc as regards to the fate of inorganic species the formation of clo3 could be limited by stopping electro oxidation at 4 h but enhanced nitrification would be required in the mbr because of the release of nh4 from mineralization of organic nitrogen overall these results emphasized the interdependence between the mbr process and the eaop in a combined treatment strategy and demonstrated that the use of eaops using suitable electrode

18664,mixing oxidant of chlorine dioxide clo2 and chlorine cl2 often applied in water disinfection two secondary wastewater effluents at different ammonium n levels 0 1 and 1 6 mg n l 1 were treated with the mixing oxidant clo2 cl2 to evaluate the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps and the associated cytotoxicity of treated wastewaters the total chlorine concentrations of clo2 and cl2 were maintained at 10 mg l 1 as cl2 with varied mixing ratios of clo2 to cl2 the formation of 37 halogenated dbps including nitrogenous brominated and iodinated analogues and 2 inorganic dbps chlorite and chlorate was examined the sum concentrations of the halogenated dbps were reduced remarkably with decreasing cl2 percentages but each individual dbp group had distinct features the regulated trihalomethanes reduced the most when clo2 was present in chlorination but decreasing cl2 percentage from 70 to 30 was not quite effective to reduce the formation of iodinated trihalomethanes haloacetic acids and haloacetontriles in low ammonium n wastewater the bromine and iodine substitution factors tend to increase with decreasing cl2 percentages indicating that destruction of dbp precursors by clo2 favored bromine and iodine incorporation additionally decreasing cl2 percentages in the mixing oxidant clo2 cl2 was often accompanied with lower chlorate formation but higher chlorite formation the toxicity of treated wastewaters was evaluated through two approaches the calculated cytotoxicity based on the concentrations of detected dbps and the experimental cytotoxicity using the chinese hamster ovary cho cells the calculated cytotoxicity decreased with decreasing cl2 percentages with haloacetonitriles and haloacetaldehydes as predominate contributors however the experimental cytotoxicity tests showed that treatment of high ammonium n wastewater with clo2 cl2 exhibited considerable higher 3 times cytotoxicity potency than using single disinfectant graphical abstract image 1 keywords chlorine dioxide clo2 chlorine cl2 ammonia bromide disinfection byproducts dbps wastewater treatment 1 introduction disinfection is usually the final stage in the wastewater treatment process in order to reduce the spread of pathogenic organisms and minimize public health risks the primary methods used for disinfection include ozonation ultraviolet irradiation and chlorination chlorine cl2 so far is the most widely used disinfectant in wastewater treatment plants however chlorination of wastewater produces a significant amount of toxic halogenated disinfection by products dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas reckhow et al 1990 richardson et al 2007 there are also many alternative disinfectants that have been used in wastewater treatment systems including chlorine dioxide clo2 potassium permanganate chloramines and peroxone ozone hydrogen peroxide among them clo2 has a powerful ability to deactivate pathogenic organisms and barely generates halogenated dbps chang et al 2000 gagnon et al 2005 son et al 2005 truchado et al 2018 clo2 is unstable for storage and transportation and thus is often generated on site using clo2 generators clo2 solution can be produced by mixing sodium chlorite or sodium chlorate with concentrated acids e g hcl h2so4 and or strong oxidants e g cl2 h2o2 naocl li et al 2013 in developing countries like china the method of mixing sodium chlorate with concentrated hydrochloric acid to generate clo2 eq 1 is more popular since the price of sodium chlorate is about a quarter or a third of that of sodium chlorite 1 2 n a c l o 3 4 h c l 2 c l o 2 2 n a c l 2 h 2 o c l 2 however the clo2 solution generated via this method is often mixed with cl2 consequently the chemical added into waters is the mixing oxidant of clo2 and cl2 instead of pure clo2 additionally the mixing of clo2 and cl2 is sometimes intentionally applied to achieve better antimicrobial efficiency than using single disinfectant hofmann et al 2004 katz et al 1994 son et al 2005 therefore the understanding of the dbp formation and the associated toxicity from the usage of the mixing oxidant clo2 cl2 will be beneficial for optimization of wastewater disinfection process the ratio of clo2 to cl2 in the mixing oxidant had great impacts on dbp formation limited studies on the mixing oxidant reported that thms formation decreased with decreasing cl2 percentage hofmann et al 2004 increasing cl2 dose in the mixing oxidant led to less chlorite formation gan et al 2016 clo2 is selectively reactive toward phenol olefin thiol and amine groups hoigne and bader 1994 clo2 pre oxidation of phenolic compounds can reduce the formation potential of thms but enhance chloral hydrate formation in post chlorination gan et al 2019 richardson et al 2003 studies about the effect of clo2 cl2 on the formation of other emerging dbps such as nitrogenous dbps n dbps brominated and iodinated dbps br and i dbps are quite few richardson et al 2003 the main constituents of wastewater effluent organic matter efom are soluble microbial products smp derived from biological treatment processes barker and stuckey 2003 compared to natural organic matter nom in drinking water sources efom contains more hydrophilic substances e g protein like moieties which are more active in halogen incorporation coble 1996 filloux et al 2012 leenheer et al 2000 vakondios et al 2014 thus chlorination of efom exhibites higher dbps formation potential than nom especially n dbps and brominated dbps krasner et al 2009 sirivedhin and gray 2005 when ammonia is present in wastewater effluents chloramines e g nh2cl nhcl2 and ncl3 is formed in chlorination the shift from free chlorine to chloramine leads to enhanced formation of n dbps which exhibite higher toxicity than regulated thms and haas schreiber and mitch 2005 selbes et al 2018 yan et al 2018 yang et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 in the case of clo2 cl2 the resulting disinfectant may shift to clo2 chloramines when ammonia is present in treated wastewater effluents besides efom and ammonia bromide and iodide are often present in the wastewater effluents sun et al 2009 leading to concerns about enhanced formation of br dbps and i dbps although clo2 per se has negligible reaction rate with bromide pre oxidation with clo2 can transform nom to more hydrophilic fractions with smaller molecules causing more br dbps formation in post chlorination rittmann and tarquin 2003 furthermore clo2 can oxidize iodide to hypoiodous acid which relates to i dbps formation bichsel and von gunten 1999 fábián and gordon 1997 the presence of cl2 in clo2 cl2 is expected to enhance the formation of br and i dbps formation compared to disinfection with pure clo2 therefore the trend of dbps formation and associated toxicity will be quite distinct when the clo2 cl2 is applied for wastewater treatment which requires further investigation as such the goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of the clo2 cl2 on the formation of regulated and unregulated dbps and their associated toxicity in wastewater treatment two municipal secondary wastewater effluents with different ammonia concentrations were used the formation of a total of 37 species of halogenated dbps table s2 including regulated dbps e g thm4 haas and unregulated dbps e g iodinated thms i thms haloacetonitriles hans haloacetamides hams halonitromethanes hnms and haloacetaldehydes hals were determined table s2 the formations of two inorganic by products chlorite and chlorate were also measured the halogen specific total organic halogen tox including total organic chlorine tocl total organic bromine tobr and total organic iodine toi were also analyzed moreover the toxicities of treated wastewaters were evaluated systematically in two ways the calculated cytotoxicity according to the weighting of the detected dbps chuang and mitch 2017 stork et al 2007 yeatts and plewa 2010 and the experimental cytotoxicity for non volatile products mainly unknown products using the chinese hamster ovary cho cell line broyer et al 2013 wagner et al 1998 the data from cho cell assays were used because the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of around one hundred dbps had been obtained by plewa s group using an identical analytical biological platform and endpoints and it was the most comprehensive toxicological database on dbps so far wagner and plewa 2017 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and wastewater collection clo2 stock solution was prepared by adding sulfuric acid to a sodium chlorite solution fig s1 the clo2 stock solution is free of chlorine a free chlorine stock solution was prepared by diluting 5 sodium hypochlorite sigma aldrich usa both clo2 and cl2 concentrations were analyzed using diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd colorimetric method the details of the dbp standards are described in table s2 in the si the secondary wastewater effluent samples were collected from two streams in one municipal wastewater treatment plant in guangdong province china the sampling points and the treatment scheme of the wastewater treatment plant were shown in text s2 and fig s2 the wastewater samples were filtered with prebaked 0 45 μm glass fiber filters and stored at 4 c until use table 1 presented the properties of wastewater samples one wastewater sample containing a low ammonia concentration of 0 1 mg n l 1 was abbreviated as wl the other sample at a high ammonia concentration of 1 6 mg n l 1 was abbreviated as wh the bromide and iodide concentrations in both wh and wl samples were spiked to achieve a final concentration of 220 and 20 μg l 1 respectively the br and i levels were both in the environmentally relevant levels cancho et al 2000 jones et al 2012 siddiqui et al 1995 2 2 disinfection procedures the applied dose of clo2 cl2 was maintained at a total concentration of 10 mg l 1 as cl2 with varied mixing ratios of clo2 to cl2 to guarantee the microbial inactivation efficiency the typical applied disinfectant dose is in the range of 2 15 mg l 1 huang et al 2011 the dose chosen in this study was to ensure chlorine residual above 1 mg l as cl2 after 30 min treatment and provide suffient chlorine to perform obvious variation in dbp formation in different mixing scenarios as the purity of clo2 from the on site clo2 generators varied depending on the generation methods and raw materials used the chlorine ratio in the generated mixing oxidants may vary from 10 to 50 on the other hand solution ofclo2 is added intentionally in chlorination to achieve better antimicrobial efficiency thus the proportions of cl2 in clo2 cl2 ranging from 0 to 100 were studied for example cl2 percentage of 70 represented the dose of 7 mg l 1 cl2 mixing with 3 mg l 1 clo2 as cl2 the experiments were conducted using wastewater samples buffered at ph 7 0 with 5 mm phosphate buffer under headspace free conditions at room temperature 25 1 c for the experiments involving the clo2 cl2 the predetermined dose of clo2 and cl2 were added to the wastewater samples simultaneously after 30 min one aliquot of the samples was quenched with 50 mg l 1 ascorbic acid and extracted within one day for individual dbp analysis another aliquot of the samples was purged with nitrogen gas to remove residual clo2 and stored at 4 c for chlorite and chlorate analysis in a week after addition of ethylenediamine as a preservative the parallel tests were also conducted to prepare samples for tox analysis and toxicity evaluation using the same procedures as described above duplicate tests were performed the error bars in figures represent the standard variation of duplicate samples spss 19 0 was used for student s t test t test comparison and analysis of variance a p value of 0 05 was accepted as indicating significance 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 dbp and tox analysis halogenated dbps 37 species belonging to seven different dbp groups were analyzed table s2 the liquid liquid extraction procedures and analytical methods were modified based on usepa methods 551 1 and 552 3 and a previous study with details presented in text s3 domino et al 2003 usepa 1995 zeng and mitch 2016 the retention time and the detection limit of each dbp were shown in table s3 inorganic dbps chlorite and chlorate were analyzed by ion chromatograph the details of measurement of tocl tobr and toi were provided in text s3 and s6 2 3 2 cytotoxicity analysis after spe extraction the cytotoxicity was assessed using the chinese hamster ovary cho cell line each sample was concentrated by solid phase extraction spe using bond elut ppl cartridge agilent usa the details were provided in text s4 and the concentration procedures recovered 76 2 4 of the organic carbon it should be noted that the spe extraction and nitrogen dry up procedures lose over 98 volatile dbps including thms hans hals hnms and hams details provided in text s4 as inorganic dbps were all lost during spe extractions han and zhang 2018 equivalent amount of chlorite and chlorate were added to extracts before cytotoxicity analysis based on their concentrations after 30 min reaction therefore the cytotoxicity tests using cho cell line in this study represented the toxicity of non volatile dbps including unknown organic products with some haas in it chlorite and chlorate the cytotoxicity tests using cho cells were measured using a previously published method with details provided in text s5 yang et al 2015 2 4 calculation of associated additive toxicity for known dbps in comparison to the cytotoxicity results from cho cell lines the calculated toxicity with a toxicity weighting method was an estimation of potential cytotoxicity associated with the concentrations of detected known dbps chuang and mitch 2017 smith et al 2010 krasner et al 2016 reungoat et al 2012 the cytotoxicity of each detected dbp was calculated by dividing the detected individual dbp concentrations m by the corresponding lc50 value lc50 values represented the concentration of an individual dbp that induces 50 viability of cho cells for 72 hr exposure compared to the negative control shown in table s4 chuang and mitch 2017 emma marie et al 2010 lc50 values were not available for chlorite and chlorate and they were excluded for calculation the calculated toxicity was assumed to be additive without significant synergistic effects thus the overall calculated cytotoxicity was a sum of the calculated toxicity of each detected dbp it should be noted that whether the toxicity obtained using cho cells was related with toxicity to human remained unknown the evaluation of absolute human health risks would require additional research using animal bioassays 3 results and discussion 3 1 dbp formation upon application of chlorine and clo2 alone the properties of the two secondary wastewater effluents were presented in table 1 both samples showed similar doc 6 2 and 7 2 mg c l 1 and suva254 values both at 1 00 l mg 1 m 1 the most distinct difference between wh and wl was their nh3 n levels 1 6 mg n l 1 and 0 1 mg n l 1 respectively during application of cl2 alone the presence of high amount of ammonia in wh resulted in the formation of chloramines westerhoff et al 2004 while the wl water was still exposed to free chlorine species consequently the total dbp concentration in wh 426 nm was less than wl 709 nm the distribution of each dbp class was also different between wh and wl fig 1 a and fig 2 a the dominant dbp species in both wh and wl were the four regulated thms thm4 chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and tribromomethane and nine haas thm4 and haa9 constituted over 70 of the total dbps in both samples the thm4 concentrations in wh 101 nm were about one third of those in wl 305 nm due to the less dbp formation from monochloramine than cl2 figs 1a and 2a however the iodinated thms i thms levels in wh were lower accounting for 77 of those in wl 34 nm for wh and 44 nm for wl dichloroiodomethane was the dominant species in i thms 17 nm for wh and 24 nm for wl chlorination of wl exhibited twice hal concentrations of those from wh with 131 and 76 nm respectively brominated acetaldehydes were dominant hals species in both samples accounting for about one third of the total hal concentrations the dominant hal species in wh and wl were bromochloroacetaldehyde and dibromochloroacetaldehyde respectively notably n dbps formation featured different trend from above discussed c dbps in wh and wl chlorination of wh produced higher hams than wl the sum of hams in wh were 47 nm which was about twice of those in wl 27 nm brominated hams in wh took up about 72 of the total hams with bromochloroacetamide as the dominant ham species however the weighting of brominated hams was lower in wl with proportions less than 67 despite the same bromide concentration in wh similar han levels were found in wh 34 nm and wl 35 nm the concentrations of bromochloroacetonitrile and dibromoacetronitrile were higher in wl than in wh the formation of tcnm was at sub nm levels in both samples the nitrogen in chloramines formed in ammonia rich wastewater may get involved in n dbps formation which resulted in considerable amount formation of n dbps as in chlorination when both samples were treated with pure clo2 similar chlorite levels were detected in wl and wh which were 42 μm and 36 μm respectively chlorate was detected at 2 2 μm for wh but no chlorate was observed in wl the sum amount of halogenated dbps was 26 nm and 22 nm in wl and wh respectively which was much lower than that in chlorination the formation of halogenated dbps during oxidation with pure clo2 may be related to hocl release during clo2 oxidation it was reported that about 20 25 of the pure clo2 converts to free chlorine during the reaction with nom rougé et al 2018 haas were the predominant species among the detected halogenated dbps upon clo2 oxidation the sum concentration of haas in wh and wl were at 12 and 18 nm respectively the sum concentrations of thm4 were less than 5 nm in both cases other dbps species were near or below detection limits the calculated toxicity in both samples was shown in figs 1c and 2c the calculated toxicity was higher in wl than wh in spite of the predominance of thms thm4 and i thms and haas by mass weight their contributions to the calculated toxicity were negligible in both cases on the contrary hals and hans contributed to over 80 of the calculated toxicity for both wh and wl although their proportions in the mass weight of all the detected dbps were about 25 similar observation has been reported that hals and hans contributed to 85 of the calculated toxicity with only 15 of the dbps on a weight basis in the chlorination of two secondary wastewater effluents 0 02 mg n l 1 chuang et al 2019 the calculated toxicity in clo2 treated samples was much lower corresponding with the lower dbp formation the experimental cho cell cytotoxicity results however showed that chlorination and pure clo2 oxidation of samples exhibited closed experimental cytotoxicity despite of the distinct dbp amounts fig 3 c please note that the comparison is based on a 5 mg l 1 cl2 dose 3 2 dbp formation from clo2 cl2 treatment of low ammonia water in comparison to clo2 alone the presence of 10 cl2 greatly enhanced the formation of halogenated dbps by over 3 times in the treatment with clo2 cl2 of wl the total halogenated dbp concentration decreased with decreasing cl2 percentages the total concentrations of the halogenated dbps were reduced by 63 when cl2 percentage was reduced by 30 from 100 to 70 fig 1a clearly the reduction of the sum concentrations of each halogenated dbp group was larger than the reduction in cl2 percentage and this phenomenon was also observed at other clo2 cl2 ratios reasonably clo2 destroyed a large fraction of dbp precursors reducing the overall dbp formation the changes in clo2 cl2 ratios however had diverse effects on different groups of dbps thm4 had the greatest reduction with decreasing cl2 percentages reduction of 81 of thm4 was observed at cl2 percentage of 70 compared to chlorination alone notably only 13 decrease was observed in the formation of i thms much lower compared to thm4 with the presence of clo2 iodide in the water can be converted to hoi or iodate dependent on reaction conditions such as clo2 to iodide molar ratios ph and reaction time guo et al 2014 hua et al 2006 the presence of hoi will react with natural organic matter and lead to the formation of i thms allard et al 2013 the detection of dibromoiodomethane and bromodiiodomethane in clo2 treated sample fig 1a also confirmed this fact comparably thm4 precursors like resorcinol and other phenolic compounds can be effectively destroyed by clo2 resulting in considerable thm4 reduction gan et al 2019 about 53 of haas was reduced when cl2 percentage was reduced from 100 to 70 surprisingly further reduction of cl2 percentage from 70 to 20 did not effectively reduce haa formation of stable haa concentrations in the range of 73 83 nm one possible explanation was that clo2 oxidized products may serve as the precursors of haas leading to less reduction in their formation clo2 oxidation generated quinone ketone groups and small molecular weight compounds such as aldehydes and carboxylic acids whose further oxidation and chlorination may form haas dąbrowska et al 2003 rougé et al 2018 wajon et al 1982 meanwhile the shift to brominated haas was also associated with reducing cl2 percentages indicating more bromine incorporation with intensive clo2 oxidation the formation of n dbps hans and hams was reduced with decreasing cl2 percentages but the reduction extent varied at different clo2 cl2 ratios for example about 32 reduction on hans and 36 on hams were found when cl2 percentage was reduced from 100 to 70 however the concentrations of hans remained at about 24 nm when cl2 percentages ranged from 70 to 40 fig s7 similarly the concentrations of hams varied from 10 to 13 nm with cl2 percentages ranging from 50 to 20 fig s9 we then evaluated the concentrations of individual han specie and found that dichloroacetonitrile concentration in samples treated with clo2 cl2 was greatly reduced in comparison to chlorination alone but bromochloroacetontrile and dibromoacetonitrile concentrations increased instead for hams bromochloroacetamide and dibromoacetamide displayed a slight increase in clo2 cl2 treated samples the dichloroacetamide concentrations were greatly reduced to below the mdl when free chlorine percentages were less than 70 thus n dbps precursors in efom may be reduced by clo2 oxidation to some extent but the changes in efom properties resulted in more bromine incorporation in hans and hams the shift of dbp species to brominated and iodinated ones with decreasing cl2 percentages was displayed from figs s4 s9 and was discussed further in the section 3 4 regarding to inorganic dbps chlorate concentrations increased with increasing cl2 percentage i e decreasing clo2 percentage this was because that chlorate formation was mainly derived from side reactions of cl2 by reacting with chlorite k 2 1 10 3 m 2 s 1 peintler et al 2002 or clo2 k 1 5 10 3 m 1 s 1 csordás et al 2001 meanwhile though the formation of chlorite tended to show a decreasing formation trend with cl2 percentages chlorite concentration formed at the cl2 percentage of 20 were much lower than that at the cl2 percentage of 30 and 10 increasing clo2 doses generally enhanced chlorite formation in the absence of cl2 but with the presence of cl2 chlorite can be consumed to produce chlorate or regenerate clo2 eqs 2 and 3 son et al 2005 which may result in a reduction of chlorite on the other hand cl2 competed with clo2 in oxidizing precursors of chlorite such as amines and phenols therefore the resulting chlorite formation in clo2 cl2 was dependent on both the formation rate and loss rate 2 c l o 2 c l 2 o h c l o 3 h c l c l 3 2 c l o 2 c l 2 2 c l o 2 2 c l the calculated toxicity was not reduced as much as dbps fig 1c the calculated toxicity was reduced by 35 though the total amount of dbps was reduced by 63 at 70 cl2 condition compared to chlorination alone i e 100 cl2 in general the contribution of each dbp class decreased with decreasing cl2 percentages corresponding with the changes on their mass concentrations still hals and hans served as major toxicity contributor in clo2 cl2 interestingly the toxicity contribution of hals decreased as cl2 percentages decreased while the contribution of hans tended to increase with decreasing cl2 percentages a peak in calculated toxicity for hans appeared at 40 cl2 percentage although the total mass concentrations of hans descended with decreasing cl2 percentages their species shifting to more toxic brominated species caused larger weighting fractions in toxicity the formation of dibromoacetonitrile had the highest concentrations 12 nm at cl2percentage of 40 fig s7 though the formation of dichloroacetonitrile decreased with decreasing cl2 percentages similarly the increases in the calculated toxicity of haas were mainly due to the increased formation of dibromoacetic acid fig s5 in comparison to clo2 alone the calculated toxicity in clo2 cl2 was higher due to the enhanced generation of the halogenated dbps the concentration response curves of the cho cell cytotoxicity assay for the wl samples are presented in fig 3 insignificant variations in the cho cytotoxicity were observed at different cl2 percentages in clo2 cl2 p 0 05 fig 3b and c 3 3 dbp formation from clo2 cl2 treatment of high ammonia water wh water contained 1 6 mg l 1 ammonium n table 1 which reacted with chlorine to form chloramines monochloramine became the reactive specie upon clo2 cl2 addition at cl2 percentages 70 at which conditions cl2 to ammonium n mass ratio was less than 5 1 in the presence of bromide bromochloramine and bromamines were also formed gazda et al 1993 kristiana et al 2009 the total dbp concentration was greatly reduced with reducing cl2 percentages upon clo2 cl2 treatment except haas fig 2a the concentrations of most dbp groups were reduced by over 80 at 20 cl2 in comparison to chlorination alone but haa concentrations were only reduced by 69 the lower reduction in haa formation was also observed in wl water results from both wastewater samples suggested that the destruction of haa precursors by clo2 oxidation was not as effective as that on thm4 precursors the reduction of the concentrations of other dbp groups such as i thms hals and hans were generally higher or comparable to the reduction in cl2 percentages regarding to inorganic dbps chlorite formation from wh oxidation generally decreased with decreasing clo2 percentages except that a peak concentration occurred at cl2 percentage of 30 chlorate formation seemed to peak at cl2 percentage of 30 40 the difference trend in wh water from wl water may be due to that cl2 reacts with ammonia k 4 2 106 m 1s 1 deborde and gunten 2008 much faster than chlorite and chloramine was unreactive to chlorite in comparison to wl water dbp formation in wh water decreased by 37 67 for thm4 22 74 for i thms 23 75 for hals 32 87 for hans and 30 62 for trichloronitromethane however the formation of hams in wh water increased by 40 74 when the percentage of cl2 was higher than 30 and decreased by 30 57 when the percentage of cl2 was lower than 20 previous studies found that haloacetamides were generally higher in chloraminated water than in chlorinated water specially at higher exposure doses chuang and mitch 2017 huang et al 2012 but at lower exposure doses mixed results were obtained huang et al 2012 the speciation of haloacetamides also showed distinct features in both wastewaters fig s9 dichloroacetamide bromochloroacetamide and dibromoacetamide were the dominant species in wh at cl2 percentages higher than 30 and dibromoacetamide was the only specie detected at cl2 percentages less than 30 whereas bromochloroacetamide was the predominant specie in wl the distribution of dbps may be highly dependent on the speciation of the chlor am ine brom am ine species in the system scheme 1 under the same clo2 cl2 mixing scenario the calculated toxicity of wh water were 146 494 lower than that of wl water mainly due to the reduced formation of dbps hans and hals still dominated the calculated toxicity in wh water the calculated toxicity generally followed a decreasing trend with less cl2 percentages the concentration response curves of the cho cell chronic cytotoxicity assay for the wh samples are presented in fig 3a the cho cytotoxicity of the wastewater did not show statically difference in raw wastewater and wastewater treated by cl2 and clo2 alone but the cytotoxicity was greatly enhanced in clo2 cl2 treatment the cytotoxicity equivalent at 50 chlorine 50 clo2 treatment 48 mg phenol l 1 was more than 3 times of the additive values of wastewater treated by 5 mg l 1 cl2 alone 8 2 mg phenol l 1 and 5 mg l 1 clo2 as cl2 alone 6 4 mg phenol l 1 fig 3c it seemed that the application of clo2 and cl2 together had a synergistic effect in terms of cytotoxicity for wh wastewater though such a trend did not exist for wl wastewater at cl2 percentages less than 70 the added cl2 will be quickly turned into monochloramine and also bromamines scheme 1 the results suggested that the mixing oxidants of clo2 chloramines bromamines may enhance the cytotoxicity of the organic extracts attributed by unknown products a previous study revealed that in the presence of br and i chloramination produced higher cytotoxicity compared to chlorination dong et al 2017 the difference obtained in this study was not obvious perhaps due to the much smaller volume samples 0 5 l extracted compared to 13 l wastewater in that study when clo2 was present the increases in cytotoxicity in ammonia rich wastewater were very pronounced the identification of brominated acids e g 2 bromobutanoic acid 3 3 dibromopropenoic acid tribromopropenoic acid and trans 2 3 dibromobutenedioic acid and brominated pyrroles 2 3 5 tribromopyrrole in wastewater treated by clo2 nh2cl in the presence of br has been reported by richardson s group richardson et al 2003 the product 2 3 5 tribromopyrrole was 8 times more cytotoxic than dibromoacetic acid but these products were also found in clo2 cl2 treated water without quantified concentrations richardson et al 2003 in another study of chlorinating saline wastewater bromine and iodine containing pyrroles were observed and their concentrations were higher in the low chlorine dose when the added chlorine were converted to monochloramine yang and zhang 2014 additionally clo2 oxidation can form benzoquinones and chlorobenzoquinones ganiev et al 2016 in the presence of br and i brominated and iodinated benzoquinones are suspected to form whose toxicity followed the order of iodo bromo chloro benoquinones li et al 2016 these products may partially contribute to the enhanced toxicity meanwhile previous studies have observed the incorporation of nitrogen from chloramines to nitrogenous dbps e g haloacetontriles and haloacetamides and intermediate products huang et al 2012 yang et al 2010 nitrosation reaction was also reported from chloramination of aromatic iodinated compounds e g iodophenol with the products much more toxic than the precursors gong et al 2017 thus the clarification of unknown products from the combination uses of chloramines and clo2 deserves further study perhaps by using high resolution mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy the results also showed that the calculated toxicity of the measured halogenated dbps barely correlated with the measured toxicity of the solid phase extracts mainly contained non volatile products the evaluation of the toxicity should thus include the volatile halogenated dbps together with the non volatile products in the extracts majority of the volatile dbps were lost during the enrichment procedures purge and cold trap method proposed by stalter and his coworkers can be used to catch the volatile dbps stalter et al 2016 3 4 bromine and iodine substitution in halogenated products to evaluate the degree of dbp bromination bromine substitution factors bsf were calculated for each class of dbps hua et al 2006 the following equations eq 4 5 and 6 use thms trihaloacetaldehyes thals and dihaloacetaldehyes dhals as examples 4 b s f t h m n 1 3 m 0 3 n n c h c l 3 n m b r n i m 3 n 0 3 c h c l 3

used and the bsf values are in the range of 0 fully chlorinated to 1 fully brominated similarly iodine incorporation factor isf was calculated for thms including iodinated species using eq 7 7 i s f t

and isf for thms during treatment by chlorine and clo2 cl2 at different mixing percentages for wh and wl samples due to the lower formation of brominated dbps after clo2 treatment their bsf values were not calculated the speciation of the dbp groups is illustrated in figs s4 s9 clo2 cl2 treatment of the samples generally caused higher bsf values and isfthm than chlorine treatment alone bsf and isfthm values for both samples increased as cl2 percentages decreased except bsfthm and bsfdhal of wh the results indicated that the introduction of clo2 increased the degree of dbp bromination and iodination and increasing clo2 percentages led to more bromide and iodide substitution into dbps although the sum of concentrations of dbps were reduced figs 1 and 2 it was probably because that clo2 oxidation transformed large aromatic and long aliphatic chain organics to small and hydrophilic organics yang et al 2013 whereas bromine and iodine were more reactive with hydrophilic and low mw precursors than their corresponding hydrophobic and high mw precursors hua and reckhow 2007 increasing bromine incorporations into thms and haas was also reported with clo2 pre oxidation followed by chlorination yang et al 2013 despite of the same bromide and iodide concentrations and similar doc concentrations of wh and wl water the bsfs of wl were generally higher than wh and the isfthm of wl was lower than wh this was relevant to the different oxidants existing in wh nh2cl nhcl2 nh2br nhbr2 nhclbr hoi and clo2 and wl hocl hobr hoi and clo2 eqs 8 17 and scheme 1 allard et al 2015 2018

chloramination resulted in relatively less bromine substitution into hans but more iodine substitution into thms than chlorination chuang and mitch 2017 lyon et al 2014 the conversion of iodide to iodate by cl2 decreased hoi formation for iodine substitution lyon et al 2014 and thus caused lower isf values for wl sample besides the targeted 37 species of dbps unknown halogenated dbps also formed simultaneously therefore we investigated the concentrations of halogen specific tox before and after treated with cl2 alone clo2 alone and clo2 cl2 fig 5 a it should be noted that tox was also detected in wh and wl without treatment and the tox values presented later were the newly formed ones after subtraction of their occurrence before treatment toi was present at 42 μg l 1 and 35 μg l 1 in wh and wl before treatment respectively the newly formed toi was not discussed here considering the errors using the subtraction method can be higher than its formation 5 μg l 1 in samples treated with clo2 cl2 and only tocl and tobr were discussed here it should be noted that clo2 would not oxidize bromide to generate hobr hoigne and bader 1994 but hocl was produced as an intermediate during clo2 oxidation of many organic compounds terhalle et al 2018 the reaction of hocl with bromide generates hobr which can further react with organic matters in wastewater to form tobr tobr tox ratios for both samples after clo2 cl2 treatment were higher than those after cl2 or clo2 treatment alone suggesting that bromination degree of halogenated dbps formed by clo2 cl2 treatment was higher than by single oxidant treatment consistent with bsf trends unknown tox utox was calculated from the difference between the sum of halogen equivalent concentrations of the 37 measured dbps and total tox bromination degree of unknown portion of dbps in tox was also evaluated by the calculation of utobr utox molar ratio fig 5b it is interesting to find that on contrary to the bsf values of the known dbps utobr utox ratios were higher for wh sample than for wl sample previous toxicology results suggested that unknown portion of dbps in tox had higher potential health risks than known dbps bull et al 2001 itoh et al 2011 richardson et al 2007 therefore the high cho cytotoxicity for wh after clo2 cl2 treatment may be relevant to unknown brominated dbp species which needs further investigation 4 conclusions in the application of clo2 cl2 the dbp formation and the associated toxicity were evaluated and the major conclusions include when clo2 disinfection was applied for wastewater treatment the purity of generated clo2 solution was the key factor for dbps control when the existence of impurity cl2 was inevitable the percentage should be controlled below 10 because dbps and their associated toxicity would sharply increase with a minor involvement of chlorination the total concentrations of thms haas hals hans hnms and hams decreased with decreasing cl2 percentages but the individual dbp group had distinct features decreasing cl2 percentages from 70 to 30 was not quite effective to reduce the formation of i thms haas and hans the bromine and iodine substitution factors tend to increase with decreasing cl2 percentages indicating that destruction of dbp precursors by clo2 favored bromine and iodine incorporation the addictive dbp associated calculated toxicity suggested hans and hals as dominant cytotoxicity contributors minimizing the cl2 proportion in clo2 cl2 was helpful to reduce the halogenated dbps and their toxicity however the experimental cytotoxicity of the spe extracts of treated wastewater exhibited distinct features from calculated toxicity especially for ammonia rich samples much higher experimental cytotoxicity was observed when clo2 cl2 was applied to ammonia rich wastewaters in this case some non volatile nitrogenous organic moieties featured with halogenated chlorine bromide and or iodide incorporation were expected to be responsible for the enhanced toxicity the exact structures of these compounds need further classification by using high resolution mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic spectroscopy chlorination was still a widely used disinfection method in wastewater disinfection in comparison to chlorination alone 100 cl2 the presence of small amount of clo2 30 clo2 70 cl2 as an example greatly reduced the total organic halogenated dbps by 62 and their addictive dbp associated calculated toxicity by 33 for wl wastewater low ammonium n the cytotoxicity of the spe concentrated extracts remained similar for both conditions considering that the mixing clo2 cl2 disinfectants also had better inactivation ability against microorganisms katz et al 1994 the addition of small amount of clo2 e g using stabilized stock solutions during chlorination process can be beneficial for better control of dbps and better organism inactivation but it was not feasible for wastewater containing high ammonium n

18664,mixing oxidant of chlorine dioxide clo2 and chlorine cl2 often applied in water disinfection two secondary wastewater effluents at different ammonium n levels 0 1 and 1 6 mg n l 1 were treated with the mixing oxidant clo2 cl2 to evaluate the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps and the associated cytotoxicity of treated wastewaters the total chlorine concentrations of clo2 and cl2 were maintained at 10 mg l 1 as cl2 with varied mixing ratios of clo2 to cl2 the formation of 37 halogenated dbps including nitrogenous brominated and iodinated analogues and 2 inorganic dbps chlorite and chlorate was examined the sum concentrations of the halogenated dbps were reduced remarkably with decreasing cl2 percentages but each individual dbp group had distinct features the regulated trihalomethanes reduced the most when clo2 was present in chlorination but decreasing cl2 percentage from 70 to 30 was not quite effective to reduce the formation of iodinated trihalomethanes haloacetic acids and haloacetontriles in low ammonium n wastewater the bromine and iodine substitution factors tend to increase with decreasing cl2 percentages indicating that destruction of dbp precursors by clo2 favored bromine and iodine incorporation additionally decreasing cl2 percentages in the mixing oxidant clo2 cl2 was often accompanied with lower chlorate formation but higher chlorite formation the toxicity of treated wastewaters was evaluated through two approaches the calculated cytotoxicity based on the concentrations of detected dbps and the experimental cytotoxicity using the chinese hamster ovary cho cells the calculated cytotoxicity decreased with decreasing cl2 percentages with haloacetonitriles and haloacetaldehydes as predominate contributors however the experimental cytotoxicity tests showed that treatment of high ammonium n wastewater with clo2 cl2 exhibited considerable higher 3 times cytotoxicity potency than using single disinfectant graphical abstract image 1 keywords chlorine dioxide clo2 chlorine cl2 ammonia bromide disinfection byproducts dbps wastewater treatment 1 introduction disinfection is usually the final stage in the wastewater treatment process in order to reduce the spread of pathogenic organisms and minimize public health risks the primary methods used for disinfection include ozonation ultraviolet irradiation and chlorination chlorine cl2 so far is the most widely used disinfectant in wastewater treatment plants however chlorination of wastewater produces a significant amount of toxic halogenated disinfection by products dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas reckhow et al 1990 richardson et al 2007 there are also many alternative disinfectants that have been used in wastewater treatment systems including chlorine dioxide clo2 potassium permanganate chloramines and peroxone ozone hydrogen peroxide among them clo2 has a powerful ability to deactivate pathogenic organisms and barely generates halogenated dbps chang et al 2000 gagnon et al 2005 son et al 2005 truchado et al 2018 clo2 is unstable for storage and transportation and thus is often generated on site using clo2 generators clo2 solution can be produced by mixing sodium chlorite or sodium chlorate with concentrated acids e g hcl h2so4 and or strong oxidants e g cl2 h2o2 naocl li et al 2013 in developing countries like china the method of mixing sodium chlorate with concentrated hydrochloric acid to generate clo2 eq 1 is more popular since the price of sodium chlorate is about a quarter or a third of that of sodium chlorite 1 2 n a c l o 3 4 h c l 2 c l o 2 2 n a c l 2 h 2 o c l 2 however the clo2 solution generated via this method is often mixed with cl2 consequently the chemical added into waters is the mixing oxidant of clo2 and cl2 instead of pure clo2 additionally the mixing of clo2 and cl2 is sometimes intentionally applied to achieve better antimicrobial efficiency than using single disinfectant hofmann et al 2004 katz et al 1994 son et al 2005 therefore the understanding of the dbp formation and the associated toxicity from the usage of the mixing oxidant clo2 cl2 will be beneficial for optimization of wastewater disinfection process the ratio of clo2 to cl2 in the mixing oxidant had great impacts on dbp formation limited studies on the mixing oxidant reported that thms formation decreased with decreasing cl2 percentage hofmann et al 2004 increasing cl2 dose in the mixing oxidant led to less chlorite formation gan et al 2016 clo2 is selectively reactive toward phenol olefin thiol and amine groups hoigne and bader 1994 clo2 pre oxidation of phenolic compounds can reduce the formation potential of thms but enhance chloral hydrate formation in post chlorination gan et al 2019 richardson et al 2003 studies about the effect of clo2 cl2 on the formation of other emerging dbps such as nitrogenous dbps n dbps brominated and iodinated dbps br and i dbps are quite few richardson et al 2003 the main constituents of wastewater effluent organic matter efom are soluble microbial products smp derived from biological treatment processes barker and stuckey 2003 compared to natural organic matter nom in drinking water sources efom contains more hydrophilic substances e g protein like moieties which are more active in halogen incorporation coble 1996 filloux et al 2012 leenheer et al 2000 vakondios et al 2014 thus chlorination of efom exhibites higher dbps formation potential than nom especially n dbps and brominated dbps krasner et al 2009 sirivedhin and gray 2005 when ammonia is present in wastewater effluents chloramines e g nh2cl nhcl2 and ncl3 is formed in chlorination the shift from free chlorine to chloramine leads to enhanced formation of n dbps which exhibite higher toxicity than regulated thms and haas schreiber and mitch 2005 selbes et al 2018 yan et al 2018 yang et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 in the case of clo2 cl2 the resulting disinfectant may shift to clo2 chloramines when ammonia is present in treated wastewater effluents besides efom and ammonia bromide and iodide are often present in the wastewater effluents sun et al 2009 leading to concerns about enhanced formation of br dbps and i dbps although clo2 per se has negligible reaction rate with bromide pre oxidation with clo2 can transform nom to more hydrophilic fractions with smaller molecules causing more br dbps formation in post chlorination rittmann and tarquin 2003 furthermore clo2 can oxidize iodide to hypoiodous acid which relates to i dbps formation bichsel and von gunten 1999 fábián and gordon 1997 the presence of cl2 in clo2 cl2 is expected to enhance the formation of br and i dbps formation compared to disinfection with pure clo2 therefore the trend of dbps formation and associated toxicity will be quite distinct when the clo2 cl2 is applied for wastewater treatment which requires further investigation as such the goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of the clo2 cl2 on the formation of regulated and unregulated dbps and their associated toxicity in wastewater treatment two municipal secondary wastewater effluents with different ammonia concentrations were used the formation of a total of 37 species of halogenated dbps table s2 including regulated dbps e g thm4 haas and unregulated dbps e g iodinated thms i thms haloacetonitriles hans haloacetamides hams halonitromethanes hnms and haloacetaldehydes hals were determined table s2 the formations of two inorganic by products chlorite and chlorate were also measured the halogen specific total organic halogen tox including total organic chlorine tocl total organic bromine tobr and total organic iodine toi were also analyzed moreover the toxicities of treated wastewaters were evaluated systematically in two ways the calculated cytotoxicity according to the weighting of the detected dbps chuang and mitch 2017 stork et al 2007 yeatts and plewa 2010 and the experimental cytotoxicity for non volatile products mainly unknown products using the chinese hamster ovary cho cell line broyer et al 2013 wagner et al 1998 the data from cho cell assays were used because the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of around one hundred dbps had been obtained by plewa s group using an identical analytical biological platform and endpoints and it was the most comprehensive toxicological database on dbps so far wagner and plewa 2017 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and wastewater collection clo2 stock solution was prepared by adding sulfuric acid to a sodium chlorite solution fig s1 the clo2 stock solution is free of chlorine a free chlorine stock solution was prepared by diluting 5 sodium hypochlorite sigma aldrich usa both clo2 and cl2 concentrations were analyzed using diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd colorimetric method the details of the dbp standards are described in table s2 in the si the secondary wastewater effluent samples were collected from two streams in one municipal wastewater treatment plant in guangdong province china the sampling points and the treatment scheme of the wastewater treatment plant were shown in text s2 and fig s2 the wastewater samples were filtered with prebaked 0 45 μm glass fiber filters and stored at 4 c until use table 1 presented the properties of wastewater samples one wastewater sample containing a low ammonia concentration of 0 1 mg n l 1 was abbreviated as wl the other sample at a high ammonia concentration of 1 6 mg n l 1 was abbreviated as wh the bromide and iodide concentrations in both wh and wl samples were spiked to achieve a final concentration of 220 and 20 μg l 1 respectively the br and i levels were both in the environmentally relevant levels cancho et al 2000 jones et al 2012 siddiqui et al 1995 2 2 disinfection procedures the applied dose of clo2 cl2 was maintained at a total concentration of 10 mg l 1 as cl2 with varied mixing ratios of clo2 to cl2 to guarantee the microbial inactivation efficiency the typical applied disinfectant dose is in the range of 2 15 mg l 1 huang et al 2011 the dose chosen in this study was to ensure chlorine residual above 1 mg l as cl2 after 30 min treatment and provide suffient chlorine to perform obvious variation in dbp formation in different mixing scenarios as the purity of clo2 from the on site clo2 generators varied depending on the generation methods and raw materials used the chlorine ratio in the generated mixing oxidants may vary from 10 to 50 on the other hand solution ofclo2 is added intentionally in chlorination to achieve better antimicrobial efficiency thus the proportions of cl2 in clo2 cl2 ranging from 0 to 100 were studied for example cl2 percentage of 70 represented the dose of 7 mg l 1 cl2 mixing with 3 mg l 1 clo2 as cl2 the experiments were conducted using wastewater samples buffered at ph 7 0 with 5 mm phosphate buffer under headspace free conditions at room temperature 25 1 c for the experiments involving the clo2 cl2 the predetermined dose of clo2 and cl2 were added to the wastewater samples simultaneously after 30 min one aliquot of the samples was quenched with 50 mg l 1 ascorbic acid and extracted within one day for individual dbp analysis another aliquot of the samples was purged with nitrogen gas to remove residual clo2 and stored at 4 c for chlorite and chlorate analysis in a week after addition of ethylenediamine as a preservative the parallel tests were also conducted to prepare samples for tox analysis and toxicity evaluation using the same procedures as described above duplicate tests were performed the error bars in figures represent the standard variation of duplicate samples spss 19 0 was used for student s t test t test comparison and analysis of variance a p value of 0 05 was accepted as indicating significance 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 dbp and tox analysis halogenated dbps 37 species belonging to seven different dbp groups were analyzed table s2 the liquid liquid extraction procedures and analytical methods were modified based on usepa methods 551 1 and 552 3 and a previous study with details presented in text s3 domino et al 2003 usepa 1995 zeng and mitch 2016 the retention time and the detection limit of each dbp were shown in table s3 inorganic dbps chlorite and chlorate were analyzed by ion chromatograph the details of measurement of tocl tobr and toi were provided in text s3 and s6 2 3 2 cytotoxicity analysis after spe extraction the cytotoxicity was assessed using the chinese hamster ovary cho cell line each sample was concentrated by solid phase extraction spe using bond elut ppl cartridge agilent usa the details were provided in text s4 and the concentration procedures recovered 76 2 4 of the organic carbon it should be noted that the spe extraction and nitrogen dry up procedures lose over 98 volatile dbps including thms hans hals hnms and hams details provided in text s4 as inorganic dbps were all lost during spe extractions han and zhang 2018 equivalent amount of chlorite and chlorate were added to extracts before cytotoxicity analysis based on their concentrations after 30 min reaction therefore the cytotoxicity tests using cho cell line in this study represented the toxicity of non volatile dbps including unknown organic products with some haas in it chlorite and chlorate the cytotoxicity tests using cho cells were measured using a previously published method with details provided in text s5 yang et al 2015 2 4 calculation of associated additive toxicity for known dbps in comparison to the cytotoxicity results from cho cell lines the calculated toxicity with a toxicity weighting method was an estimation of potential cytotoxicity associated with the concentrations of detected known dbps chuang and mitch 2017 smith et al 2010 krasner et al 2016 reungoat et al 2012 the cytotoxicity of each detected dbp was calculated by dividing the detected individual dbp concentrations m by the corresponding lc50 value lc50 values represented the concentration of an individual dbp that induces 50 viability of cho cells for 72 hr exposure compared to the negative control shown in table s4 chuang and mitch 2017 emma marie et al 2010 lc50 values were not available for chlorite and chlorate and they were excluded for calculation the calculated toxicity was assumed to be additive without significant synergistic effects thus the overall calculated cytotoxicity was a sum of the calculated toxicity of each detected dbp it should be noted that whether the toxicity obtained using cho cells was related with toxicity to human remained unknown the evaluation of absolute human health risks would require additional research using animal bioassays 3 results and discussion 3 1 dbp formation upon application of chlorine and clo2 alone the properties of the two secondary wastewater effluents were presented in table 1 both samples showed similar doc 6 2 and 7 2 mg c l 1 and suva254 values both at 1 00 l mg 1 m 1 the most distinct difference between wh and wl was their nh3 n levels 1 6 mg n l 1 and 0 1 mg n l 1 respectively during application of cl2 alone the presence of high amount of ammonia in wh resulted in the formation of chloramines westerhoff et al 2004 while the wl water was still exposed to free chlorine species consequently the total dbp concentration in wh 426 nm was less than wl 709 nm the distribution of each dbp class was also different between wh and wl fig 1 a and fig 2 a the dominant dbp species in both wh and wl were the four regulated thms thm4 chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and tribromomethane and nine haas thm4 and haa9 constituted over 70 of the total dbps in both samples the thm4 concentrations in wh 101 nm were about one third of those in wl 305 nm due to the less dbp formation from monochloramine than cl2 figs 1a and 2a however the iodinated thms i thms levels in wh were lower accounting for 77 of those in wl 34 nm for wh and 44 nm for wl dichloroiodomethane was the dominant species in i thms 17 nm for wh and 24 nm for wl chlorination of wl exhibited twice hal concentrations of those from wh with 131 and 76 nm respectively brominated acetaldehydes were dominant hals species in both samples accounting for about one third of the total hal concentrations the dominant hal species in wh and wl were bromochloroacetaldehyde and dibromochloroacetaldehyde respectively notably n dbps formation featured different trend from above discussed c dbps in wh and wl chlorination of wh produced higher hams than wl the sum of hams in wh were 47 nm which was about twice of those in wl 27 nm brominated hams in wh took up about 72 of the total hams with bromochloroacetamide as the dominant ham species however the weighting of brominated hams was lower in wl with proportions less than 67 despite the same bromide concentration in wh similar han levels were found in wh 34 nm and wl 35 nm the concentrations of bromochloroacetonitrile and dibromoacetronitrile were higher in wl than in wh the formation of tcnm was at sub nm levels in both samples the nitrogen in chloramines formed in ammonia rich wastewater may get involved in n dbps formation which resulted in considerable amount formation of n dbps as in chlorination when both samples were treated with pure clo2 similar chlorite levels were detected in wl and wh which were 42 μm and 36 μm respectively chlorate was detected at 2 2 μm for wh but no chlorate was observed in wl the sum amount of halogenated dbps was 26 nm and 22 nm in wl and wh respectively which was much lower than that in chlorination the formation of halogenated dbps during oxidation with pure clo2 may be related to hocl release during clo2 oxidation it was reported that about 20 25 of the pure clo2 converts to free chlorine during the reaction with nom rougé et al 2018 haas were the predominant species among the detected halogenated dbps upon clo2 oxidation the sum concentration of haas in wh and wl were at 12 and 18 nm respectively the sum concentrations of thm4 were less than 5 nm in both cases other dbps species were near or below detection limits the calculated toxicity in both samples was shown in figs 1c and 2c the calculated toxicity was higher in wl than wh in spite of the predominance of thms thm4 and i thms and haas by mass weight their contributions to the calculated toxicity were negligible in both cases on the contrary hals and hans contributed to over 80 of the calculated toxicity for both wh and wl although their proportions in the mass weight of all the detected dbps were about 25 similar observation has been reported that hals and hans contributed to 85 of the calculated toxicity with only 15 of the dbps on a weight basis in the chlorination of two secondary wastewater effluents 0 02 mg n l 1 chuang et al 2019 the calculated toxicity in clo2 treated samples was much lower corresponding with the lower dbp formation the experimental cho cell cytotoxicity results however showed that chlorination and pure clo2 oxidation of samples exhibited closed experimental cytotoxicity despite of the distinct dbp amounts fig 3 c please note that the comparison is based on a 5 mg l 1 cl2 dose 3 2 dbp formation from clo2 cl2 treatment of low ammonia water in comparison to clo2 alone the presence of 10 cl2 greatly enhanced the formation of halogenated dbps by over 3 times in the treatment with clo2 cl2 of wl the total halogenated dbp concentration decreased with decreasing cl2 percentages the total concentrations of the halogenated dbps were reduced by 63 when cl2 percentage was reduced by 30 from 100 to 70 fig 1a clearly the reduction of the sum concentrations of each halogenated dbp group was larger than the reduction in cl2 percentage and this phenomenon was also observed at other clo2 cl2 ratios reasonably clo2 destroyed a large fraction of dbp precursors reducing the overall dbp formation the changes in clo2 cl2 ratios however had diverse effects on different groups of dbps thm4 had the greatest reduction with decreasing cl2 percentages reduction of 81 of thm4 was observed at cl2 percentage of 70 compared to chlorination alone notably only 13 decrease was observed in the formation of i thms much lower compared to thm4 with the presence of clo2 iodide in the water can be converted to hoi or iodate dependent on reaction conditions such as clo2 to iodide molar ratios ph and reaction time guo et al 2014 hua et al 2006 the presence of hoi will react with natural organic matter and lead to the formation of i thms allard et al 2013 the detection of dibromoiodomethane and bromodiiodomethane in clo2 treated sample fig 1a also confirmed this fact comparably thm4 precursors like resorcinol and other phenolic compounds can be effectively destroyed by clo2 resulting in considerable thm4 reduction gan et al 2019 about 53 of haas was reduced when cl2 percentage was reduced from 100 to 70 surprisingly further reduction of cl2 percentage from 70 to 20 did not effectively reduce haa formation of stable haa concentrations in the range of 73 83 nm one possible explanation was that clo2 oxidized products may serve as the precursors of haas leading to less reduction in their formation clo2 oxidation generated quinone ketone groups and small molecular weight compounds such as aldehydes and carboxylic acids whose further oxidation and chlorination may form haas dąbrowska et al 2003 rougé et al 2018 wajon et al 1982 meanwhile the shift to brominated haas was also associated with reducing cl2 percentages indicating more bromine incorporation with intensive clo2 oxidation the formation of n dbps hans and hams was reduced with decreasing cl2 percentages but the reduction extent varied at different clo2 cl2 ratios for example about 32 reduction on hans and 36 on hams were found when cl2 percentage was reduced from 100 to 70 however the concentrations of hans remained at about 24 nm when cl2 percentages ranged from 70 to 40 fig s7 similarly the concentrations of hams varied from 10 to 13 nm with cl2 percentages ranging from 50 to 20 fig s9 we then evaluated the concentrations of individual han specie and found that dichloroacetonitrile concentration in samples treated with clo2 cl2 was greatly reduced in comparison to chlorination alone but bromochloroacetontrile and dibromoacetonitrile concentrations increased instead for hams bromochloroacetamide and dibromoacetamide displayed a slight increase in clo2 cl2 treated samples the dichloroacetamide concentrations were greatly reduced to below the mdl when free chlorine percentages were less than 70 thus n dbps precursors in efom may be reduced by clo2 oxidation to some extent but the changes in efom properties resulted in more bromine incorporation in hans and hams the shift of dbp species to brominated and iodinated ones with decreasing cl2 percentages was displayed from figs s4 s9 and was discussed further in the section 3 4 regarding to inorganic dbps chlorate concentrations increased with increasing cl2 percentage i e decreasing clo2 percentage this was because that chlorate formation was mainly derived from side reactions of cl2 by reacting with chlorite k 2 1 10 3 m 2 s 1 peintler et al 2002 or clo2 k 1 5 10 3 m 1 s 1 csordás et al 2001 meanwhile though the formation of chlorite tended to show a decreasing formation trend with cl2 percentages chlorite concentration formed at the cl2 percentage of 20 were much lower than that at the cl2 percentage of 30 and 10 increasing clo2 doses generally enhanced chlorite formation in the absence of cl2 but with the presence of cl2 chlorite can be consumed to produce chlorate or regenerate clo2 eqs 2 and 3 son et al 2005 which may result in a reduction of chlorite on the other hand cl2 competed with clo2 in oxidizing precursors of chlorite such as amines and phenols therefore the resulting chlorite formation in clo2 cl2 was dependent on both the formation rate and loss rate 2 c l o 2 c l 2 o h c l o 3 h c l c l 3 2 c l o 2 c l 2 2 c l o 2 2 c l the calculated toxicity was not reduced as much as dbps fig 1c the calculated toxicity was reduced by 35 though the total amount of dbps was reduced by 63 at 70 cl2 condition compared to chlorination alone i e 100 cl2 in general the contribution of each dbp class decreased with decreasing cl2 percentages corresponding with the changes on their mass concentrations still hals and hans served as major toxicity contributor in clo2 cl2 interestingly the toxicity contribution of hals decreased as cl2 percentages decreased while the contribution of hans tended to increase with decreasing cl2 percentages a peak in calculated toxicity for hans appeared at 40 cl2 percentage although the total mass concentrations of hans descended with decreasing cl2 percentages their species shifting to more toxic brominated species caused larger weighting fractions in toxicity the formation of dibromoacetonitrile had the highest concentrations 12 nm at cl2percentage of 40 fig s7 though the formation of dichloroacetonitrile decreased with decreasing cl2 percentages similarly the increases in the calculated toxicity of haas were mainly due to the increased formation of dibromoacetic acid fig s5 in comparison to clo2 alone the calculated toxicity in clo2 cl2 was higher due to the enhanced generation of the halogenated dbps the concentration response curves of the cho cell cytotoxicity assay for the wl samples are presented in fig 3 insignificant variations in the cho cytotoxicity were observed at different cl2 percentages in clo2 cl2 p 0 05 fig 3b and c 3 3 dbp formation from clo2 cl2 treatment of high ammonia water wh water contained 1 6 mg l 1 ammonium n table 1 which reacted with chlorine to form chloramines monochloramine became the reactive specie upon clo2 cl2 addition at cl2 percentages 70 at which conditions cl2 to ammonium n mass ratio was less than 5 1 in the presence of bromide bromochloramine and bromamines were also formed gazda et al 1993 kristiana et al 2009 the total dbp concentration was greatly reduced with reducing cl2 percentages upon clo2 cl2 treatment except haas fig 2a the concentrations of most dbp groups were reduced by over 80 at 20 cl2 in comparison to chlorination alone but haa concentrations were only reduced by 69 the lower reduction in haa formation was also observed in wl water results from both wastewater samples suggested that the destruction of haa precursors by clo2 oxidation was not as effective as that on thm4 precursors the reduction of the concentrations of other dbp groups such as i thms hals and hans were generally higher or comparable to the reduction in cl2 percentages regarding to inorganic dbps chlorite formation from wh oxidation generally decreased with decreasing clo2 percentages except that a peak concentration occurred at cl2 percentage of 30 chlorate formation seemed to peak at cl2 percentage of 30 40 the difference trend in wh water from wl water may be due to that cl2 reacts with ammonia k 4 2 106 m 1s 1 deborde and gunten 2008 much faster than chlorite and chloramine was unreactive to chlorite in comparison to wl water dbp formation in wh water decreased by 37 67 for thm4 22 74 for i thms 23 75 for hals 32 87 for hans and 30 62 for trichloronitromethane however the formation of hams in wh water increased by 40 74 when the percentage of cl2 was higher than 30 and decreased by 30 57 when the percentage of cl2 was lower than 20 previous studies found that haloacetamides were generally higher in chloraminated water than in chlorinated water specially at higher exposure doses chuang and mitch 2017 huang et al 2012 but at lower exposure doses mixed results were obtained huang et al 2012 the speciation of haloacetamides also showed distinct features in both wastewaters fig s9 dichloroacetamide bromochloroacetamide and dibromoacetamide were the dominant species in wh at cl2 percentages higher than 30 and dibromoacetamide was the only specie detected at cl2 percentages less than 30 whereas bromochloroacetamide was the predominant specie in wl the distribution of dbps may be highly dependent on the speciation of the chlor am ine brom am ine species in the system scheme 1 under the same clo2 cl2 mixing scenario the calculated toxicity of wh water were 146 494 lower than that of wl water mainly due to the reduced formation of dbps hans and hals still dominated the calculated toxicity in wh water the calculated toxicity generally followed a decreasing trend with less cl2 percentages the concentration response curves of the cho cell chronic cytotoxicity assay for the wh samples are presented in fig 3a the cho cytotoxicity of the wastewater did not show statically difference in raw wastewater and wastewater treated by cl2 and clo2 alone but the cytotoxicity was greatly enhanced in clo2 cl2 treatment the cytotoxicity equivalent at 50 chlorine 50 clo2 treatment 48 mg phenol l 1 was more than 3 times of the additive values of wastewater treated by 5 mg l 1 cl2 alone 8 2 mg phenol l 1 and 5 mg l 1 clo2 as cl2 alone 6 4 mg phenol l 1 fig 3c it seemed that the application of clo2 and cl2 together had a synergistic effect in terms of cytotoxicity for wh wastewater though such a trend did not exist for wl wastewater at cl2 percentages less than 70 the added cl2 will be quickly turned into monochloramine and also bromamines scheme 1 the results suggested that the mixing oxidants of clo2 chloramines bromamines may enhance the cytotoxicity of the organic extracts attributed by unknown products a previous study revealed that in the presence of br and i chloramination produced higher cytotoxicity compared to chlorination dong et al 2017 the difference obtained in this study was not obvious perhaps due to the much smaller volume samples 0 5 l extracted compared to 13 l wastewater in that study when clo2 was present the increases in cytotoxicity in ammonia rich wastewater were very pronounced the identification of brominated acids e g 2 bromobutanoic acid 3 3 dibromopropenoic acid tribromopropenoic acid and trans 2 3 dibromobutenedioic acid and brominated pyrroles 2 3 5 tribromopyrrole in wastewater treated by clo2 nh2cl in the presence of br has been reported by richardson s group richardson et al 2003 the product 2 3 5 tribromopyrrole was 8 times more cytotoxic than dibromoacetic acid but these products were also found in clo2 cl2 treated water without quantified concentrations richardson et al 2003 in another study of chlorinating saline wastewater bromine and iodine containing pyrroles were observed and their concentrations were higher in the low chlorine dose when the added chlorine were converted to monochloramine yang and zhang 2014 additionally clo2 oxidation can form benzoquinones and chlorobenzoquinones ganiev et al 2016 in the presence of br and i brominated and iodinated benzoquinones are suspected to form whose toxicity followed the order of iodo bromo chloro benoquinones li et al 2016 these products may partially contribute to the enhanced toxicity meanwhile previous studies have observed the incorporation of nitrogen from chloramines to nitrogenous dbps e g haloacetontriles and haloacetamides and intermediate products huang et al 2012 yang et al 2010 nitrosation reaction was also reported from chloramination of aromatic iodinated compounds e g iodophenol with the products much more toxic than the precursors gong et al 2017 thus the clarification of unknown products from the combination uses of chloramines and clo2 deserves further study perhaps by using high resolution mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy the results also showed that the calculated toxicity of the measured halogenated dbps barely correlated with the measured toxicity of the solid phase extracts mainly contained non volatile products the evaluation of the toxicity should thus include the volatile halogenated dbps together with the non volatile products in the extracts majority of the volatile dbps were lost during the enrichment procedures purge and cold trap method proposed by stalter and his coworkers can be used to catch the volatile dbps stalter et al 2016 3 4 bromine and iodine substitution in halogenated products to evaluate the degree of dbp bromination bromine substitution factors bsf were calculated for each class of dbps

and isf for thms during treatment by chlorine and clo2 cl2 at different mixing percentages for wh and wl samples due to the lower formation of brominated dbps after clo2 treatment their bsf values were not calculated the speciation of the dbp groups is illustrated in figs s4 s9 clo2 cl2 treatment of the samples generally caused higher bsf values and isfthm than chlorine treatment alone bsf and isfthm values for both samples increased as cl2 percentages decreased except bsfthm and bsfdhal of wh the results indicated that the introduction of clo2 increased the degree of dbp bromination and iodination and increasing clo2 percentages led to more bromide and iodide substitution into dbps although the sum of concentrations of dbps were reduced figs 1 and 2 it was probably because that clo2 oxidation transformed large aromatic and long aliphatic chain organics to small and hydrophilic organics yang et al 2013 whereas bromine and iodine were more reactive with hydrophilic and low mw precursors than their corresponding hydrophobic and high mw precursors hua and reckhow 2007 increasing bromine incorporations into thms and haas was also reported with clo2 pre oxidation followed by chlorination yang et al 2013 despite of the same bromide and iodide concentrations and similar doc concentrations of wh and wl water the bsfs of wl were generally higher than wh and the isfthm of wl was lower than wh this was relevant to the different oxidants existing in wh nh2cl nhcl2 nh2br nhbr2 nhclbr hoi and clo2 and wl hocl hobr hoi and clo2 eqs 8 17 and scheme 1 allard et al 2015 2018

chloramination resulted in relatively less bromine substitution into hans but more iodine substitution into thms than chlorination chuang and mitch 2017 lyon et al 2014 the conversion of iodide to iodate by cl2 decreased hoi formation for iodine substitution lyon et al 2014 and thus caused lower isf values for wl sample besides the targeted 37 species of dbps unknown halogenated dbps also formed simultaneously therefore we investigated the concentrations of halogen specific tox before and after treated with cl2 alone clo2 alone and clo2 cl2 fig 5 a it should be noted that tox was also detected in wh and wl without treatment and the tox values presented later were the newly formed ones after subtraction of their occurrence before treatment toi was present at 42 μg l 1 and 35 μg l 1 in wh and wl before treatment respectively the newly formed toi was not discussed here considering the errors using the subtraction method can be higher than its formation 5 μg l 1 in samples treated with clo2 cl2 and only tocl and tobr were discussed here it should be noted that clo2 would not oxidize bromide to generate hobr hoigne and bader 1994 but hocl was produced as an intermediate during clo2 oxidation of many organic compounds terhalle et al 2018 the reaction of hocl with bromide generates hobr which can further react with organic matters in wastewater to form tobr tobr tox ratios for both samples after clo2 cl2 treatment were higher than those after cl2 or clo2 treatment alone suggesting that bromination degree of halogenated dbps formed by clo2 cl2 treatment was higher than by single oxidant treatment consistent with bsf trends unknown tox utox was calculated from the difference between the sum of halogen equivalent concentrations of the 37 measured dbps and total tox bromination degree of unknown portion of dbps in tox was also evaluated by the calculation of utobr utox molar ratio fig 5b it is interesting to find that on contrary to the bsf values of the known dbps utobr utox ratios were higher for wh sample than for wl sample previous toxicology results suggested that unknown portion of dbps in tox had higher potential health risks than known dbps bull et al 2001 itoh et al 2011 richardson et al 2007 therefore the high cho cytotoxicity for wh after clo2 cl2 treatment may be relevant to unknown brominated dbp species which needs further investigation 4 conclusions in the application of clo2 cl2 the dbp formation and the associated toxicity were evaluated and the major conclusions include when clo2 disinfection was applied for wastewater treatment the purity of generated clo2 solution was the key factor for dbps control when the existence of impurity cl2 was inevitable the percentage should be controlled below 10 because dbps and their associated toxicity would sharply increase with a minor involvement of chlorination the total concentrations of thms haas hals hans hnms and hams decreased with decreasing cl2 percentages but the individual dbp group had distinct features decreasing cl2 percentages from 70 to 30 was not quite effective to reduce the formation of i thms haas and hans the bromine and iodine substitution factors tend to increase with decreasing cl2 percentages indicating that destruction of dbp precursors by clo2 favored bromine and iodine incorporation the addictive dbp associated calculated toxicity suggested hans and hals as dominant cytotoxicity contributors minimizing the cl2 proportion in clo2 cl2 was helpful to reduce the halogenated dbps and their toxicity however the experimental cytotoxicity of the spe extracts of treated wastewater exhibited distinct features from calculated toxicity especially for ammonia rich samples much higher experimental cytotoxicity was observed when clo2 cl2 was applied to ammonia rich wastewaters in this case some non volatile nitrogenous organic moieties featured with halogenated chlorine bromide and or iodide incorporation were expected to be responsible for the enhanced toxicity the exact structures of these compounds need further classification by using high resolution mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic spectroscopy chlorination was still a widely used disinfection method in wastewater disinfection in comparison to chlorination alone 100 cl2 the presence of small amount of clo2 30 clo2 70 cl2 as an example greatly reduced the total organic halogenated dbps by 62 and their addictive dbp associated calculated toxicity by 33 for wl wastewater low ammonium n the cytotoxicity of the spe concentrated extracts remained similar for both conditions considering that the mixing clo2 cl2 disinfectants also had better inactivation ability against microorganisms katz et al 1994 the addition of small amount of clo2 e g using stabilized stock solutions during chlorination process can be beneficial for better control of dbps and better organism inactivation but it was not feasible for wastewater containing high ammonium n
