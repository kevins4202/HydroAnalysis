5130,physically distributed hydrological models are effective in hydrological simulations of large river basins but the complex characteristics of hydrological features limit their application an easy to use and high efficiency hydrological model is needed for efficient water resource management in practice machine learning ml based models have the potential to provide fast mapping pathways between meteorological predictors and hydrological responses without detailed descriptions of the corresponding physical processes however the extensive data requirements ignoring of spatial variability and poor performance for extreme flows limit the application of ml models this study attempts to develop an ml based hydrological model by combining physically based distributed hydrological model with an artificial neural networks ann computer vision cv and a categorization approach ca to solve the insufficient training problem we use a physically distributed hydrological model gbhm together with a stochastic rainfall generator to generate a large amount of synthetic data gbhm ann to improve the extreme flow simulation we add the categorization approach into gbhm ann gbhm ann ca to capture the spatial variability of the predictors we also use a local binary pattern based computer vision method to form gbhm ann ca cv model the effectiveness of the three modeling approaches are demonstrated by synthetic case studies we finally evaluate gbhm ann ca cv using the real data from the upper chao phraya basin in thailand the results show that the prediction accuracy of our new data driven model is greatly improved in data limited watersheds specifically the cv extracted spatial information can improve the robustness of the data driven hydrological model and the ca can greatly improve high flow simulations the combined model yields a satisfactory accuracy for long term daily streamflow simulations this study demonstrates the potential of ml based hydrological models in water resource management especially in changing environments keywords hydrological modeling physically distributed model machine learning computer vision categorization approach 1 introduction physically based hydrological models have been widely used for streamflow simulations and forecasting arnold and fohrer 2005 chen et al 2011 jia et al 2001 refsgaard 1997 yang et al 2002 among the various kinds of physically based models fully distributed hydrological models which can consider the spatial variability of the watershed landscape and its atmospheric forcing are considered to be the gold standard for hydrological modeling chen et al 2016 and have been applied in ungauged basins götzinger and bárdossy 2007 hunukumbura et al 2012 wambura et al 2018 however with complex model structures and extensive calculation requirements physically based distributed hydrological models often have high computational costs and require high levels of hydrological expertise for modelers and users thus limiting their application in water resource management chen et al 2016 kratzert et al 2018 srivastav et al 2007 yaseen et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a zhang et al 2018b machine learning ml based methods can recognize patterns hidden in historical data and they may provide quick and direct mapping pathways between predictors and hydrological responses without explicit descriptions of the underlying physical processes adnan et al 2019 kasiviswanathan et al 2016 sahoo et al 2017 many studies have demonstrated that ml models can outperform other state of the art techniques in natural science fields including hydrology alquraishi 2019 he et al 2019 kratzert et al 2018 kratzert et al 2019a kratzert et al 2019b zhang et al 2020 among the various ml models neural networks are the most widely reported methods for streamflow simulations and forecasting for example hsu et al 1995 compared the runoff forecasting performance of a physically based model called the sacramento soil moisture accounting model sac sma to that of a three layer artificial neural network ann under various flow regimes and the results showed that the ann model provided a better representation of the rainfall runoff relationship demirel et al 2009 compared an ann model with a process based semi distributed model called the soil and water assessment tool swat for streamflow forecasting one day in advance and the comparisons showed that the ann was more successful than swat in peak flow forecasting humphrey et al 2016 combined a bayesian artificial neural network with a physically based conceptual model called gr4j for monthly streamflow forecasting and the results show that both the hybrid model and pure ann model outperformed the gr4j conceptual hydrological model recently deep learning dl neural network models such as long short term memory lstm networks have been reported to be suitable for rainfall runoff process modeling for example kratzert et al 2019b improved the standard lstm architecture and proposed an entity aware lstm ea lstm for hydrological modeling that could learn catchment similarities and outperformed five physically based hydrological models however current ml based hydrological models suffer from several drawbacks first ml models often require a large amount of training data to obtain robust performance kalra and ahmad 2009 kratzert et al 2019b this characteristic severely limits the applicability of ml in hydrological simulation and prediction because the majority of streams in the world lack long term hydrological observations goswami et al 2007 kratzert et al 2019a sivapalan 2003 jiang et al 2018 developed a computer vision based data driven model for daily runoff simulations in a gauged basin and tested the transfer learning performance in an ungauged basin their results showed that the overall performance of the model was satisfactory in the ungauged basin but it could not accurately predict high flows kratzert et al 2019a added catchment characteristics as the predictor variables of an lstm model that was trained with data from a large number of gauged basins and explored the capability of this regionally trained model for predictions in ungauged basins although the ungauged lstm model displayed better performance than traditional models it still required large amounts of data from gauged basins with long term observations for training karpatne et al 2017 introduced a physics guided or theory guided data science and showed that hydrological mechanism guided methods are effective but need further study moreover traditional ml models often ignore the spatial variability in the watershed landscape and the related atmospheric forcing and they aggregate data over the watershed as model inputs jiang et al 2018 however hydrological responses are often significantly impacted by the spatial patterns of driving forces and terrain characteristics chen et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2015 computer vision cv algorithms have made it possible to overcome this drawback cv technology is used to extract information from images which allows machines to understand images by processing digital signals wang et al 2013 instead of using the values associated with each pixel cv uses features to quantitatively describe images in low dimensions cv has been applied to some areas of earth science and is reported to be able to effectively extract spatial information from images for example to classify crops in very high resolution remote sensing images sun et al 2020 proposed a method guided by hierarchical perception a cv based concept and the model performed well and displayed high precision with the help of cv ling et al 2019 developed a convolutional neural network based super resolution mapping model that can effectively estimate the subpixel scale details of rivers and the wetted width by combining a convolution neural network and lstm network miao et al 2019 proposed a statistical downscaling method to improve the precipitation prediction of a general circulation model gcm in a monsoon region among various cv algorithms local binary pattern lbp is one of the most popular methods used in the field of pattern recognition gupta et al 2020 he and sang 2013 heikkilä et al 2009 jiang et al 2018 khan et al 2020 lbp was first developed by ojala et al 1996 in a comparative study of texture measures which is an image operator based on local pixel information and is complementary to the contrast information gupta et al 2020 the lbp can potentially be used to capture the watershed spatial pattern in hydrological modeling third as statistical methods are purely based on observation data ml based hydrological models often provide poor simulations of high flows which are important in practical applications sudheer et al 2003 wu et al 2009 yang et al 2019 the frequency of high flows in streamflow time series is relatively low which may lead to insufficient model training yang et al 2019 sudheer et al 2003 proposed a data transformation method based on a statistical model to improve the peak flow estimation with an ann since the underlying mechanisms of runoff generation may be quite different under various flow regimes a single global ml model often fails to provide satisfactory predictions for both extreme high and low values and even normal values hsu et al 1995 solomatine and ostfeld 2008 wu et al 2009 several researchers have attempted to improve the modeling performance by using categorization models which means that sub processes were identified first and separate models were built for each sub process to improve the prediction of high magnitude flows sivapragasam and liong 2005 proposed a method to classify flow into low medium and high flow and built the support vector machine model for each type of flow wu et al 2009 proposed a crisp distributed support vectors regression cdsvr model for monthly streamflow forecasts they used the fuzzy c means clustering technique to split the flow data into three subsets and then fitted three single support vector regressions to three subsets zemzami and benaabidate 2016 and tongal and booij 2018 both tried to improve the ml model performance for peak flow simulations by separating the streamflow into a baseflow and quick response flow chu et al 2019 divided the streamflow time series to different flow regimes by a fuzzy c means method and developed data driven models for each regime to map the nonlinear relationship between the selected predictors and streamflow the categorization approach ca needs to be further studied in peak flow simulations with insufficient observation data as a physically based distributed hydrological model the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm developed by yang et al 1998 has been successfully applied in many regions such as the yangtze river li et al 2015 mekong river wang et al 2016 and jiulong river lu et al 2018 in this study gbhm is used to provide sufficient training samples for ml models with gradient based optimization schemes the traditional ann model may yield premature convergence and become trapped at local optima in addition the traditional model is very sensitive to the initial conditions including the initial weights and biases yang et al 2017 zanchettin and ludermir 2007 to overcome these drawbacks the ga is used in this study to optimize the initial conditions of ann which can achieve an optimal solution bahrami et al 2016 thus the ga ann model is used for the hydrological simulation in this study in this study we develop a physical process and ml combined hydrological model for continuous daily hydrological simulations in data limited watersheds located in northern thailand with rainfall data generated by a stochastic rainfall generator a physically based distributed hydrological model is used to generate sufficient streamflow samples for training and validation in the data insufficient basins the spatial features are extracted from the predictor images by using cv algorithms and are mapped to the hydrological responses by categorization models we strive to 1 verify the effectiveness of the distributed hydrological model in supporting the ml based data driven model in data insufficient basins 2 explore the use of spatial information and predictors extracted by cv 3 investigate the effectiveness of the categorization approach in improving high flow simulations and 4 test the applicability of the combined model using real data 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area see fig 1 the ping river basin is located in northern thailand with a drainage area of 26 386 km2 this basin is upstream of the bhumibol reservoir which is the largest reservoir in thailand the ping river is one of the main tributaries of the chao phraya river and flows through chiang mai which is the largest city in northern thailand the elevation of the basin ranges from 229 m in the south to 2572 m in the north and the spatial heterogeneity of the topography and meteorology is significant the climate is a tropical monsoon pattern with a mean annual precipitation of approximately 900 mm the temporal distribution of rainfall is highly heterogeneous on average approximately 90 of the total annual precipitation is concentrated in the wet season from may to november and the rest occurs during the dry season from december to april ponpang nga and techamahasaranont 2016 the mean annual air temperature is approximately 22 c and forest is the dominant land cover type which accounts for approximately 80 of the total area 2 2 observation data the data used in this study include daily climate forcing observations geographic information from the study area and daily streamflow measurements collected by three runoff gauges the climate forcing data include daily precipitation daily air temperature mean maximum and minimum daily mean relative humidity daily mean wind speed and daily sunshine duration data qin et al 2017 yang et al 2019 all climate forcing data except the wind speed were observed at 96 rainfall stations and 14 meteorological stations and were provided by the royal irrigation department of thailand within the chao phraya river basin these data were spatially interpolated into gridded images with a spatial resolution of 2 5 km 2 5 km by an angular distance weighting method with elevation corrections yang et al 2004 the spatial distributions of the daily wind speed 0 25 0 25 were obtained from the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 to match the spatial resolution of 2 5 km 2 5 km we resampled the original data by the nearest neighbor assignment using esri arcgis 10 6 software because the stochastic rainfall generator srg requires more than 20 years of historical records as raw materials we selected 57 rainfall stations within and around the study area among 96 rainfall stations which had more than 20 years of data available before january 1 2010 to generate synthetic data by srg the soil data of the ping river basin were obtained from the harmonized world soil database hwsd fao et al 2012 and the soil water parameters including the soil hydraulic conductivity saturated soil moisture and residual soil moisture were spatially interpolated using the methods proposed by rawls and brakensiek 1985 geomorphological information including the slope slope length and elevation was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 90 m jarvis et al 2008 the land use maps were provided by the department of land development of thailand and the vegetation parameters including the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar and the leaf area index lai are obtained from the 3rd generation normalized difference vegetation index ndvi3g of the global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms project zhu et al 2013 streamflow data at three stations including the gauge at the nawarat bridge referred to as gauge p1 the gauge in the chom thong referred to as gauge p73 and the gauge in the sam ngao district referred to as gauge p12 were selected to evaluate model performance the data were provided by the royal irrigation department of thailand gauge p1 is located near chiang mai in the upper ping river basin with a drainage area of 6355 km2 gauge p73 is located in the central portion of the ping river basin with a drainage area of 14 814 km2 gauge p12 is located at the basin outlet detailed information on the data used in this study is given in table 1 3 methodology 3 1 modeling approaches to overcome the limitations of previous ml based hydrological models we propose three corresponding modeling approaches and then develop a physical process and machine learning combined hydrological model in addition we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed modelling framework by comparing different data driven models step by step 3 1 1 three modeling approaches the main limitations of previous data driven models in hydrological simulations are the extensive data requirements ignoring catchment spatial variability and poor performance for extreme flow simulation accordingly we propose three modeling approaches to solve those drawbacks to overcome the need for large training data sets we propose a hydrologically guided modeling approach that can be regarded as a kind of physics guided data science method karpatne et al 2017 this approach combines a widely used physically distributed hydrological model a geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm yang et al 1998 with a stochastic rainfall generator srg basinger et al 2010 to generate sufficient physical synthetic data to train ml models specifically the srg is used to generate synthetic rainfall data and the calibrated gbhm model is used to generate corresponding runoff data with the synthetic rainfall data set used as the input this method can avoid the drawback of previous data driven models and allow the proposed model to be applied in basins for which long term hydrological observations are scarce the details of this method are provided in section 3 2 to consider the spatial heterogeneity of predictors we adopt a local binary pattern based computer vision method lbp cv ojala et al 1996 to extract the spatial features of predictors and use these spatial features as model inputs the lbp cv method is an effective feature representation algorithm especially for hydrological variables jiang et al 2018 and it can extract both texture and intensity features from gridded images the details of this method are provided in section 3 3 to effectively simulate high flows we propose a categorization approach ca which is similar to the approach introduced by sivapragasam and liong 2005 in particular this approach splits the training data into four sub datasets subsets of small medium large and extraordinarily large flows based on the relevant percentiles and then establishes separate ann models for each sub dataset for prediction during the test period we first use the trained random subspace ensemble k nearest neighbor rs knn classifier to predict the flow magnitude labels of streamflow data and then choose the corresponding ann model to predict the streamflow the ca can avoid the problem of insufficient training for high flows due to their low frequency in streamflow time series and can thus improve the high flow prediction capability of data driven models the details of the ann and rs knn are given in section 3 4 3 1 2 gbhm ann ca cv model we develop a physical process and ml combined hydrological model gbhm ann ca cv in this study for hydrological simulation and the modelling framework is shown in fig 2 the model mainly consists of four main steps the first step is data preprocessing which includes input variable selection training data generation and spatial feature extraction since this model is driven by gbhm generated synthetic data the same inputs are used the model inputs are composed of three types of variables including meteorological forcing variables vegetation parameters and catchment geomorphologic information qin et al 2017 yang et al 2002 the meteorological inputs include daily precipitation daily mean air temperature daily relative humidity and daily potential evapotranspiration calculated by the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 the vegetation input includes the lai which is linearly interpolated to a daily resolution the catchment geomorphologic inputs include the slope slope length and elevation derived from the dem since there is a delay from the start of a rainfall event to the time when runoff occurs and this lag time needs to be considered in model development we calculate the lag time 71 8 h 3 days of the ping basin according to the method suggested by the united states department of agriculture mockus 1964 and meteorological predictors with a 3 day lag time are adopted detailed information on the model inputs is given in table 2 after determining the model inputs the physically based synthetic data for model development are generated by using the srg and gbhm with the synthetic dataset the spatial features of input variables are extracted by lbp cv and concatenated to form a feature space for ml to avoid model overfitting we adopt principal component analysis pca to further reduce the dimensionality of the feature space pca is a widely used linear method for data reduction it tries to identify a small number of uncorrelated variables i e principal components that are the linear combination of origin variables the detail information of pca can be found in kramer 1998 we select streamflow at time step t as the response variable for the ml model and the result can be expressed as 1 q t f p t p t 1 p t 2 p t 3 t t t t 1 t t 2 t t 3 h t h t 1 h t 2 h t 3 e t e t 1 e t 2 e t 3 l a i t l a i t 1 l a i t 2 l a i t 3 s s l e l e where q is streamflow p is precipitation t is the mean air temperature h is the relative humidity and e is the potential evapotranspiration which are all functions of time and space variable s is the slope sl is the slope length and ele is the elevation these variables are only functions of space the second step is to train and validate the machine learning based models with the ca the third step is to predict the streamflow labels with a random subspace ensemble rs knn classifier and generate the predicted streamflow in the test period the synthetic precipitation and streamflow data are used to develop the rs knn classifier since precipitation has the most important impact on runoff generation the areal mean precipitation for the current day and previous three days and the 3 day cumulative areal mean precipitation are selected as the predictor variables for the classifier the magnitude of the streamflow labels is selected as the target variable since the number of measurements with small magnitude labels is far greater than the number of samples with other labels we simply reproduce the samples with these labels so that the number of samples is approximately equal for all label classes with the trained rs knn the magnitude labels of streamflow can be predicted and the fourth step is to choose the corresponding sub model to predict the streamflow on each day in the test period this label prediction approach can be expressed as 2 l t g p t p t 1 p t 2 p t 3 cp t cp t 1 cp t 2 cp t 3 where l is the label p is the areal mean precipitation cp is the 3 day cumulative areal mean precipitation and g represents the classifier we carry out a comparison of three data driven models for runoff simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the modelling framework the first is a simple ann with the same predictors as the gbhm ann ca cv and it is used as the baseline model the second is an ann model driven by gbhm generated synthetic data referred to as gbhm ann and the comparison between the ann and gbhm ann can be used to determine if the performance of the ml model driven by gbhm generated synthetic data is superior for data insufficient basins the third is an ann model coupled with a categorization approach driven by gbhm generated synthetic data referred to as gbhm ann ca and the comparison between gbhm ann ca and gbhm ann can be used to assess the effectiveness of the categorization approach in improving the capability of data driven models to simulate high flows the three models all use the areal mean values of predictor variables instead of spatial features the comparison between gbhm ann ca and gbhm ann ca cv can be used to explore the effects of spatial variability on the robustness of data driven hydrological models for models driven by gbhm generated synthetic data we use 48 year synthetic data for training and 12 year synthetic data for validation for models driven by observations we use the observations from 1 january 1990 to 31 december 2005 for training and the observations from 1 january 2006 to 31 december 2009 for validation the streamflow values at three runoff gauges i e p1 p73 and p12 from 1 january 2010 to 31 december 2016 are predicted by all four models in this study for testing we use three different criteria to evaluate the overall performance of the models the root mean square errors rmse the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 nse is a normalized statistical index with a value between 0 and 1 and a larger value indicates a better simulation pbias reflects the overall flow bias error and a value close to 0 indicates a good simulation it is commonly acknowledged that the performance of hydrological models is considered satisfactory if nse greater than 0 50 and 15 pbias 15 for daily streamflow simulation moriasi et al 2007 the model performance for low flow simulations is typically evaluated based on the logarithmic transformed nash sutcliffe efficiency lnse smakhtin et al 1998 and the performance of peak flow simulation is evaluated by the peak error pe which is just the percent bias of the peak the peak flow events in streamflow series are identified by the peaks over threshold pot method and a threshold that leads to three events per year is adopted in this study the details of the pot method can be found in the previous study of mediero et al 2014 3 2 synthetic data by srg and gbhm we generate a training and validation dataset by combining the srg and gbhm to alleviate the limitations of previous ml based hydrological models in data insufficient areas specifically we use the srg to obtain synthetic rainfall data and the gbhm to obtain the corresponding streamflow samples 3 2 1 stochastic rainfall generator we use a nonparametric approach srg developed by basinger et al 2010 which uses a bootstrapped markov chain to generate synthetic series based on a user specified historical record of daily rainfall and maintains the statistical characteristics of the historical rainfall the method includes three major steps the first step is to calculate the occurrence probabilities of precipitation for each day in historical sequences the precipitation on each day in the historical series is assigned a dry or wet label with dry representing a zero value of precipitation and wet representing a positive value to describe the occurrence statistics of historical precipitation we calculate three types of probabilities for each day in the historical series with the following equations 3 prob w w w d 4 prob w w ww ww w d 5 prob d d dd dw d d where prob w is the probability of a wet day prob w w is the conditional probability of a wet day following a wet day and prob d d is the conditional probability of a dry day following a dry day letter w is the number of wet days d is the number of dry days ww is the number of wet days following wet days wd is the number of dry days following wet days dd is the number of dry days following dry days and dw is the number of wet days following dry days for each day of the year the second step is to assign dry wet labels to each day in all years of the simulated series considering the seasonality of rainfall the label for each day is assigned according to the label of the previous day for a day with a dry label the simulated precipitation is zero for a day with a wet label the amount of rain is randomly selected from the historical precipitation amounts with specific consideration of seasonality this rainfall generator can ensure the seasonality of synthetic series and avoid the occurrence of unreasonable prediction values the detailed calculation process was presented by basinger et al 2010 we use the srg method to generate synthetic rainfall time series for the 57 selected rainfall stations based on their 20 year historical observations since precipitation is the main factor in runoff generation we only generate synthetic rainfall series and other meteorological variables are still based on historical observations we obtain corresponding synthetic climate forcing data and spatially interpolate these data to gridded images with a spatial resolution of 2 5 km 2 5 km using an angular distance weighting method with elevation corrections yang et al 2004 3 2 2 geomorphology based hydrological model the gbhm is a distributed hydrological model developed by yang et al 1998 and it mainly consists of hydrological simulations in each hillslope unit and river routing along river networks the simulations in each unit mainly involve calculations of evapotranspiration canopy interception surface flow infiltration unsaturated flow and groundwater flow river routing is calculated by kinematic wave methods and the total runoff at the outlet of each sub catchment can be obtained by summing the runoff contributions in each grid detailed descriptions of the model were given by yang et al 1998 and yang et al 2002 we use the gbhm in this study to simulate the hydrological processes in the ping river basin to reflect the real physical situation in the study area we first calibrate and validate the gbhm using historical observations the spatial resolution of the model is chosen as 2 5 km 2 5 km and the entire basin is split into 58 sub catchments the model is activated and initialized with a 6 year warm up period and the daily streamflow data at p12 from 1 january 2000 to 31 december 2004 are used to calibrate parameters including the slope shape factor groundwater hydraulic conductivity and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the topsoil miao et al 2016 we use the data from 1 january 2005 to 31 december 2009 to validate the model after calibration and validation the developed gbhm can be assumed to reflect the real hydrological processes in the region and can be used to generate streamflow samples second with synthetic climate forcing data points as inputs the calibrated model is used to generate synthetic streamflow series for model development in data insufficient basins 3 3 spatial features extracted by computer vision cv algorithms this study uses cv algorithms to obtain the spatial features of the predictor images specifically the texture feature is extracted by the local binary pattern lbp algorithm developed by jiang et al 2018 and the intensity feature is represented by the areal mean of pixel values for a 3 3 pixel block the values of 8 neighboring pixels are first transformed to 0 or 1 using the value at the center pixel as the threshold then an 8 bit binary code is indexed for the center pixel the corresponding decimal of this 8 bit binary code is referred to as the lbp value at the center pixel and the lbp value of each pixel over an image can then be calculated to describe the statistical characteristics of the lbp values in an image a histogram is usually used and the number of bins in the histograms can be set to range from 1 to 256 in this study considering the computational complexity the number of bins is set to 15 and the texture feature of an image is represented by a 15 dimensional histogram vector detailed descriptions of the lbp method and its applications were given by ojala et al 1996 khan et al 2020 and kaya et al 2014 here we use a spatial pyramid matching spm strategy lazebnik et al 2006 to capture the spatial layout of the texture and intensity features for the three level spm used in this study each image is split into 1 2 2 4 21 21 and 16 22 22 sub images and the spatial features 15 dimensional texture vector and 1 dimensional intensity vector are independently extracted from each sub image all the sub image features are concatenated to create a feature vector with a dimension of 336 1 4 16 15 1 finally the spatial features of all 23 input variables see eq 1 are concatenated and a feature space with a dimension of 8418 23 366 is generated we use the pca method to further reduce the dimensionality of the feature space and a 118 dimensional input feature space is finally obtained with a 95 explained variability the details of the spm strategy were reported by lazebnik et al 2006 and the detailed process of image spatial feature extraction with the lbp cv and spm methods is described by jiang et al 2018 3 4 machine learning methods we use two ml methods for regression and classification ann and rs knn classifiers we split the synthetic data into training 80 and validation 20 sets to determine whether the model effectively learned the behavior of the gbhm for all three gauges the observation data from 1 january 2010 to 31 december 2016 were used to test the prediction capability of the models the test period included extreme floods 2011 3 4 1 artificial neural network ann we use a three layer ann with initial conditions optimized by a genetic algorithm ga for hydrological simulations in which ga is used to optimize the initial conditions the detailed architecture of the ann was presented by yang et al 2019 and more details of the ga were provided by wang 1991 in this study we use the mean square error mse as the loss function and the nse as the objective function for the optimization of the initial conditions we adopt the levenberg marquardt lm method for neural network training in addition the tanh function is used as the activation function in this study and the model is implemented with matlab software beale et al 1992 3 4 2 ensemble k nearest neighbor rs knn classifier in this study the streamflow data are separated into four sub datasets including those for small medium large and extraordinarily large flows and the separation is determined based on the 80th 95th and 98th percentiles of the flow frequency distribution curve obtained from historical observations sun et al 2008 the 80th percentile is used to distinguish the small and medium flow the 95th percentile is used to distinguish the medium and large flows and the 98th percentile is used to distinguish the large and extraordinarily large flows under the separation criteria the streamflow on each day is assigned a corresponding flow magnitude label we use the random subspace ensemble k nearest neighbor classifier rs knn to predict the magnitude labels i e small medium large or extraordinarily large of the streamflow for each day in the test period the k nearest neighbor knn aha et al 1991 classifier is used to predict the membership of objects based on the closest training instances in the feature space yang et al 2012 the k closest neighbors of an instance are defined according to the pearson correlation coefficient and the label value of each instance is determined based on these neighbors with the majority vote principle yang et al 2011 as a popular ensemble learning method the random subspace algorithm includes bootstrapping and aggregation in the feature space chen et al 2019 this approach can improve the efficiency and accuracy of classification compared to the values using a single classifier kuncheva et al 2010 by combining rs and knn the rs knn classifier randomly divides the entire feature space into several subspaces and the knn classifier is trained for each subspace the final ensemble decision is generated according to the majority vote principle the details of the rs knn classifier were reported by kuncheva et al 2010 and the classifier was implemented with matlab software 4 results in this section we present the calibration and validation results of the gbhm and compare the performance of four data driven models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the modelling framework proposed in this study the prediction capability of the proposed model is examined with the data observed from 1 january 2010 to 31 december 2016 in the study area 4 1 calibration and validation of gbhm we first calibrate and validate the gbhm using data from three stations fig 3 and table 3 show the streamflow simulations for three gauges obtained with the gbhm in the calibration and validation periods at gauge p1 the model achieves a high nse value of 0 79 and a slight underestimation with a pbias of 9 6 for the daily discharge in the calibration period additionally the nse is 0 68 and the pbias value is 4 3 in the validation period at gauge p73 the model achieves a high nse value of 0 80 and a slight underestimation with a pbias of 9 2 in the calibration period in the validation period the nse is 0 78 and pbias is 12 3 at gauge p12 the nse values are 0 79 and 0 84 and the pbias values are 7 83 and 4 76 in the calibration and validation periods respectively the results show that the calibrated gbhm model can effectively describe the hydrological processes in the ping river basin and be used to generate streamflow time series 4 2 results of the synthetic studies to evaluate how three proposed modeling approaches are effective we use the simulation results of the simple ann by using limited observations as the baseline and design three experiments including streamflow simulations by gbhm ann gbhm ann ca and gbhm ann ca cv with synthetic data before showing the results of the four models we summarize the performance of the rs knn classifier in table 4 during the training validation and test periods the rs knn performs well for the three gauges with correct percentages of more than 90 these results indicate that the classifier can accurately predict the magnitude labels of streamflow according to precipitation information as a baseline model the simple ann is trained and validated with 20 year observations we consider the number of hidden neurons as a tuning parameter and select it from a preset of ranges between 5 and 30 for each value we run for 20 times and the maximum nse among the 20 times is taken as the representative value we use the same tuning method for all the ml models in this study after adjusting hyperparameters we use architectures with 12 hidden neurons for gauge p1 10 hidden neurons for gauge p12 and 15 hidden neurons for gauge p1 the results are shown in fig 4 and table 5 the simple ann adequately simulates the streamflow at gauge p12 but false simulations are generated at gauges p1 and p73 the difference in performance for the three gauges indicates that the ann model lacks robustness which may be caused by ignoring the spatial variability of predictors in addition the ann performs poorly under both low flow and peak flow conditions and significantly underestimates the peak flows at all three gauges likely due to the inadequacy of training data for the extreme flood in 2011 mateo et al 2015 the ann model is unable to simulate the event at all three gauges and significantly underestimates the peak flow with pe values greater than 49 although the ann is an easy to use method that requires only several seconds to run 10 year simulations it must be improved to be a surrogate model of the gbhm to overcome the problem of inadequate training data physically based synthetic data are generated by the gbhm and srg for model training and validation to determine the suitable lengths of synthetic time series data for model training and validation we calculate the performance i e nse during the test period of gbhm ann using different lengths of synthetic data the synthetic data are split into training 80 of data for initially fitting and validation 20 of data for hyper parameter tuning sets according to a commonly adopted 80 20 split rule yang et al 2016 and all models are tested with the climate forcing observations and corresponding gbhm generated streamflow data from 1 january 2010 to 31 december 2016 as shown in fig 5 it can be seen that the simulations become stable with an acceptable accuracy nse 0 7 when the data lengths were more than 60 years the 60 year synthetic data are shown in fig 6 here we emphatically introduce the simulation results of gbhm ann with 60 year synthetic data it should be clarified that the performance of the gbhm ann is evaluated based on a comparison of the gbhm ann simulations and synthetic runoff data the architecture of the gbhm ann includes 25 hidden neurons for gauge p1 24 hidden neurons for gauge p12 and 28 hidden neurons for gauge p1 after adjusting hyperparameters with the same parameter adjustment method as that used by simple ann the results of gbhm ann are shown in fig 7 and table 5 the model performs satisfactorily at all three gauges during the test period while an unbalanced performance of the model at the three gauges still exists with a worse simulation at gauge p1 for the extreme flood in 2011 the gbhm ann provides a better flood simulation result with higher nse and lower pbias values but significantly underestimates the peak flow at the three gauges with large pe values more than 30 although the significant peak flow underestimations have been greatly mitigated the peak flow simulation is still unsatisfactory with high pe values this issue must be addressed in the next modeling step to improve the ability of gbhm ann to simulate high flows a categorization approach is used and gbhm ann ca is developed the architecture of gbhm ann ca includes 12 hidden neurons for small magnitude modules 10 hidden neurons for medium magnitude modules 5 hidden neurons for large magnitude modules and 5 hidden neurons for extraordinarily large magnitude modules at all three gauges after the adjustment of hyperparameters with the same parameter adjustment method as simple ann fig 8 and table 5 show the simulation results and performance of gbhm ann ca with the support of ca the performance of the model can be judged as satisfactory at all three gauges and the simulation of peak flow and low flow has been improved greatly in terms of the extreme flood in 2011 gbhm ann ca provides a satisfactory result for peak flows with a low pe less than 15 but significantly overestimates the peak flow at gauge p73 with a high pe value of 27 1 this overestimation at p73 may be caused by the sparsity of rainfall gauges in addition a relatively large difference between peak flow simulations at three gauges still exists and needs to be improved in the next modeling step to improve the robustness of gbhm ann ca lbp cv is used to extract the spatial features and gbhm ann ca cv is proposed the architectures of the four modules have 25 hidden neurons in the hidden layer after hyperparameter adjustment with the same parameter adjustment method as simple ann as shown in fig 9 and table 5 the model can learn the hydrological behavior of the gbhm with a good performance and the model performance levels for the three gauges are satisfactory with nse values greater than 0 85 and pbias values less than 15 in terms of model performance for low flow and peak flow simulations the lnse values are all greater than 0 65 and the pe values are all less than 15 at three gauges for the extreme flood in 2011 gbhm ann ca cv exhibit satisfactory performances with high nse greater than 0 8 and low pbias less than 15 values 4 3 results of a real case study after examining the model performance in learning the hydrological behavior of the gbhm the gbhm ann ca cv model can be regarded as the best surrogate model for the gbhm and the prediction capability of the model needs to be investigated with real data therefore we compare the gbhm ann ca cv simulations with observations at the three gauges as shown in fig 10 and table 6 since gbhm ann ca cv is driven by gbhm generated synthetic data its prediction capability will not exceed that of the gbhm thus we also compare the observations and simulations of the gbhm during the test period the results show that both the gbhm and gbhm ann ca cv yield satisfactory performances at the three gauges although the prediction accuracy of gbhm ann ca cv is lower than that of gbhm with nse values that are approximately 10 higher in low flow prediction the prediction accuracy of gbhm ann ca cv is also lower than that of the gbhm with lnse values that are approximately 15 higher in terms of peak flow prediction there are slight underestimations in the gbhm results and slight overestimations in the gbhm ann ca cv results at p1 and p73 and there are significant underestimations in both the gbhm and gbhm ann ca cv results at p12 in terms of the computing cost the total computational time is greatly reduced by ml it takes on the order of tens of seconds to run the 10 year simulation using the gbhm ann ca cv model and it takes on the order of tens of hours for the 10 year simulation using the gbhm model the considerable improvement in the computational time can be useful for practical water resource management especially for real time streamflow forecasting and flash flood warnings 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of different modeling approaches 1 effectiveness of the hydrological mechanisms guided modeling approach to demonstrate the effectiveness of hydrological mechanism guided modeling approaches we compare the performances of the gbhm ann with those of a simple ann gbhm ann which adopts sufficient synthetic data for training and validation performs better at all three gauges the nse values of the simulation results at the three gauges are improved by an average of 23 during the test period specifically with sufficient training data the significant underestimation of peak flow has been alleviated this comparison suggests that physically based hydrological models can greatly improve the performance of data driven models when historical observations are limited 2 effectiveness of the categorization approach we compare the performance of gbhm ann ca and gbhm ann to demonstrate the effectiveness of the categorization approaches gbhm ann ca is superior since it has much higher nse and lower pbias values and a better performance under both low flow and peak flow conditions by using separate sub datasets for the simulation the ca avoids the insufficient training of high and low flows caused by their low frequencies in flow series and thus improves the nse values by an average of 27 during the test period at the three gauges the results show that the ca based gbhm ann model can significantly improve the effectiveness of the peak flow simulation 3 effectiveness of the spatial information extracted by the lbp cv method compared with the robust performance of gbhm ann ca cv for peak flow simulation the pe values of the gbhm ann ca simulation show a significant overestimation for gauge p73 and a slight underestimation for gauges p1 and p12 considering the spatial variability of the predictors the lbp cv method solves the performance differences of gbhm ann ca at the three gauges and improves the nse values of all the three gauges by an average of 2 during the test period the results highlight that the spatial feature information extracted by the lbp cv approach can improve the simulation results especially for peak flow simulations 5 2 simulation uncertainties of gbhm ann ca cv we argue that the simulation uncertainties of the gbhm ann ca cv model mainly come from the gbhm model and the ml methods adopted in the model the error of the gbhm mainly comes from the uncertainties associated with the model parameters model structure and meteorological inputs li et al 2012 since the soil depth and soil types were obtained from the hwsd dataset with a relatively low spatial resolution the heterogeneity of the soil information may not be fully captured at the regional scale and thus the estimated soil parameters may be influenced by large uncertainties limited by the understanding of hydrological processes the model structure cannot fully describe real hydrological processes with high accuracy and this limitation can result in uncertainties additionally limited by the number of meteorological stations in the study area the spatial interpolation of the meteorological predictors is a relatively uncertain process and may increase the simulation error the error in ml mainly comes from the uncertainties of label prediction with the rs knn and the streamflow prediction with the ann in the future since remote sensing can effectively capture the spatial heterogeneity of meteorological variables remote sensing data can be used in the model thus reducing the model uncertainties in addition compared with the physically based hydrological model the model proposed in this study is unable to simultaneously provide discharge simulations for different catchments future studies need to explore how to develop a fully distributed data driven hydrological model that not only considers the spatial heterogeneity of predictors but also provides distributed hydrological simulations 6 conclusion this study proposed three approaches to improve the prediction capability of machine learning based hydrological models and developed a physical process and ml combined hydrological model for rainfall runoff simulation in data insufficient watersheds the model performance in learning the hydrological behaviors of the physically distributed hydrological model was evaluated with a synthetic dataset and the prediction capability was investigated using real data according to the results we developed the following conclusions 1 driven by the synthetic data generated by a distributed hydrological model the performance of the ml based data driven model was greatly improved for daily runoff simulations in watersheds with limited historical runoff observations by using the long term time series generated by the gbhm and srg the insufficient training problem that often occurs in daily streamflow simulations due to data scarcity can be overcome and the nse values were improved by an average of 23 during the test period 2 the streamflow categorization approach greatly improved the peak flow simulation capability of the data driven hydrological model and the nse values were improved by 27 on average during the test period this approach is potentially useful for real time water resource management especially for flood and drought prediction 3 the cv methods used in this study can effectively capture the spatial heterogeneity of predictors which can significantly improve the robustness of data driven hydrological models for rainfall runoff simulations in large river basins 4 the model developed in this study can effectively learn the hydrological behaviors of physically based distributed hydrological models e g the gbhm and can be applied for long term daily streamflow simulation and prediction in large data insufficient catchments in addition with the rapid development of computer technology and artificial intelligence the modelling framework proposed in this study can be improved in the future with enhancements in physically distributed

5130,physically distributed hydrological models are effective in hydrological simulations of large river basins but the complex characteristics of hydrological features limit their application an easy to use and high efficiency hydrological model is needed for efficient water resource management in practice machine learning ml based models have the potential to provide fast mapping pathways between meteorological predictors and hydrological responses without detailed descriptions of the corresponding physical processes however the extensive data requirements ignoring of spatial variability and poor performance for extreme flows limit the application of ml models this study attempts to develop an ml based hydrological model by combining physically based distributed hydrological model with an artificial neural networks ann computer vision cv and a categorization approach ca to solve the insufficient training problem we use a physically distributed hydrological model gbhm together with a stochastic rainfall generator to generate a large amount of synthetic data gbhm ann to improve the extreme flow simulation we add the categorization approach into gbhm ann gbhm ann ca to capture the spatial variability of the predictors we also use a local binary pattern based computer vision method to form gbhm ann ca cv model the effectiveness of the three modeling approaches are demonstrated by synthetic case studies we finally evaluate gbhm ann ca cv using the real data from the upper chao phraya basin in thailand the results show that the prediction accuracy of our new data driven model is greatly improved in data limited watersheds specifically the cv extracted spatial information can improve the robustness of the data driven hydrological model and the ca can greatly improve high flow simulations the combined model yields a satisfactory accuracy for long term daily streamflow simulations this study demonstrates the potential of ml based hydrological models in water resource management especially in changing environments keywords hydrological modeling physically distributed model machine learning computer vision categorization approach 1 introduction physically based hydrological models have been widely used for streamflow simulations and forecasting arnold and fohrer 2005 chen et al 2011 jia et al 2001 refsgaard 1997 yang et al 2002 among the various kinds of physically based models fully distributed hydrological models which can consider the spatial variability of the watershed landscape and its atmospheric forcing are considered to be the gold standard for hydrological modeling chen et al 2016 and have been applied in ungauged basins götzinger and bárdossy 2007 hunukumbura et al 2012 wambura et al 2018 however with complex model structures and extensive calculation requirements physically based distributed hydrological models often have high computational costs and require high levels of hydrological expertise for modelers and users thus limiting their application in water resource management chen et al 2016 kratzert et al 2018 srivastav et al 2007 yaseen et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a zhang et al 2018b machine learning ml based methods can recognize patterns hidden in historical data and they may provide quick and direct mapping pathways between predictors and hydrological responses without explicit descriptions of the underlying physical processes adnan et al 2019 kasiviswanathan et al 2016 sahoo et al 2017 many studies have demonstrated that ml models can outperform other state of the art techniques in natural science fields including hydrology alquraishi 2019 he et al 2019 kratzert et al 2018 kratzert et al 2019a kratzert et al 2019b zhang et al 2020 among the various ml models neural networks are the most widely reported methods for streamflow simulations and forecasting for example hsu et al 1995 compared the runoff forecasting performance of a physically based model called the sacramento soil moisture accounting model sac sma to that of a three layer artificial neural network ann under various flow regimes and the results showed that the ann model provided a better representation of the rainfall runoff relationship demirel et al 2009 compared an ann model with a process based semi distributed model called the soil and water assessment tool swat for streamflow forecasting one day in advance and the comparisons showed that the ann was more successful than swat in peak flow forecasting humphrey et al 2016 combined a bayesian artificial neural network with a physically based conceptual model called gr4j for monthly streamflow forecasting and the results show that both the hybrid model and pure ann model outperformed the gr4j conceptual hydrological model recently deep learning dl neural network models such as long short term memory lstm networks have been reported to be suitable for rainfall runoff process modeling for example kratzert et al 2019b improved the standard lstm architecture and proposed an entity aware lstm ea lstm for hydrological modeling that could learn catchment similarities and outperformed five physically based hydrological models however current ml based hydrological models suffer from several drawbacks first ml models often require a large amount of training data to obtain robust performance kalra and ahmad 2009 kratzert et al 2019b this characteristic severely limits the applicability of ml in hydrological simulation and prediction because the majority of streams in the world lack long term hydrological observations goswami et al 2007 kratzert et al 2019a sivapalan 2003 jiang et al 2018 developed a computer vision based data driven model for daily runoff simulations in a gauged basin and tested the transfer learning performance in an ungauged basin their results showed that the overall performance of the model was satisfactory in the ungauged basin but it could not accurately predict high flows kratzert et al 2019a added catchment characteristics as the predictor variables of an lstm model that was trained with data from a large number of gauged basins and explored the capability of this regionally trained model for predictions in ungauged basins although the ungauged lstm model displayed better performance than traditional models it still required large amounts of data from gauged basins with long term observations for training karpatne et al 2017 introduced a physics guided or theory guided data science and showed that hydrological mechanism guided methods are effective but need further study moreover traditional ml models often ignore the spatial variability in the watershed landscape and the related atmospheric forcing and they aggregate data over the watershed as model inputs jiang et al 2018 however hydrological responses are often significantly impacted by the spatial patterns of driving forces and terrain characteristics chen et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2015 computer vision cv algorithms have made it possible to overcome this drawback cv technology is used to extract information from images which allows machines to understand images by processing digital signals wang et al 2013 instead of using the values associated with each pixel cv uses features to quantitatively describe images in low dimensions cv has been applied to some areas of earth science and is reported to be able to effectively extract spatial information from images for example to classify crops in very high resolution remote sensing images sun et al 2020 proposed a method guided by hierarchical perception a cv based concept and the model performed well and displayed high precision with the help of cv ling et al 2019 developed a convolutional neural network based super resolution mapping model that can effectively estimate the subpixel scale details of rivers and the wetted width by combining a convolution neural network and lstm network miao et al 2019 proposed a statistical downscaling method to improve the precipitation prediction of a general circulation model gcm in a monsoon region among various cv algorithms local binary pattern lbp is one of the most popular methods used in the field of pattern recognition gupta et al 2020 he and sang 2013 heikkilä et al 2009 jiang et al 2018 khan et al 2020 lbp was first developed by ojala et al 1996 in a comparative study of texture measures which is an image operator based on local pixel information and is complementary to the contrast information gupta et al 2020 the lbp can potentially be used to capture the watershed spatial pattern in hydrological modeling third as statistical methods are purely based on observation data ml based hydrological models often provide poor simulations of high flows which are important in practical applications sudheer et al 2003 wu et al 2009 yang et al 2019 the frequency of high flows in streamflow time series is relatively low which may lead to insufficient model training yang et al 2019 sudheer et al 2003 proposed a data transformation method based on a statistical model to improve the peak flow estimation with an ann since the underlying mechanisms of runoff generation may be quite different under various flow regimes a single global ml model often fails to provide satisfactory predictions for both extreme high and low values and even normal values hsu et al 1995 solomatine and ostfeld 2008 wu et al 2009 several researchers have attempted to improve the modeling performance by using categorization models which means that sub processes were identified first and separate models were built for each sub process to improve the prediction of high magnitude flows sivapragasam and liong 2005 proposed a method to classify flow into low medium and high flow and built the support vector machine model for each type of flow wu et al 2009 proposed a crisp distributed support vectors regression cdsvr model for monthly streamflow forecasts they used the fuzzy c means clustering technique to split the flow data into three subsets and then fitted three single support vector regressions to three subsets zemzami and benaabidate 2016 and tongal and booij 2018 both tried to improve the ml model performance for peak flow simulations by separating the streamflow into a baseflow and quick response flow chu et al 2019 divided the streamflow time series to different flow regimes by a fuzzy c means method and developed data driven models for each regime to map the nonlinear relationship between the selected predictors and streamflow the categorization approach ca needs to be further studied in peak flow simulations with insufficient observation data as a physically based distributed hydrological model the geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm developed by yang et al 1998 has been successfully applied in many regions such as the yangtze river li et al 2015 mekong river wang et al 2016 and jiulong river lu et al 2018 in this study gbhm is used to provide sufficient training samples for ml models with gradient based optimization schemes the traditional ann model may yield premature convergence and become trapped at local optima in addition the traditional model is very sensitive to the initial conditions including the initial weights and biases yang et al 2017 zanchettin and ludermir 2007 to overcome these drawbacks the ga is used in this study to optimize the initial conditions of ann which can achieve an optimal solution bahrami et al 2016 thus the ga ann model is used for the hydrological simulation in this study in this study we develop a physical process and ml combined hydrological model for continuous daily hydrological simulations in data limited watersheds located in northern thailand with rainfall data generated by a stochastic rainfall generator a physically based distributed hydrological model is used to generate sufficient streamflow samples for training and validation in the data insufficient basins the spatial features are extracted from the predictor images by using cv algorithms and are mapped to the hydrological responses by categorization models we strive to 1 verify the effectiveness of the distributed hydrological model in supporting the ml based data driven model in data insufficient basins 2 explore the use of spatial information and predictors extracted by cv 3 investigate the effectiveness of the categorization approach in improving high flow simulations and 4 test the applicability of the combined model using real data 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area see fig 1 the ping river basin is located in northern thailand with a drainage area of 26 386 km2 this basin is upstream of the bhumibol reservoir which is the largest reservoir in thailand the ping river is one of the main tributaries of the chao phraya river and flows through chiang mai which is the largest city in northern thailand the elevation of the basin ranges from 229 m in the south to 2572 m in the north and the spatial heterogeneity of the topography and meteorology is significant the climate is a tropical monsoon pattern with a mean annual precipitation of approximately 900 mm the temporal distribution of rainfall is highly heterogeneous on average approximately 90 of the total annual precipitation is concentrated in the wet season from may to november and the rest occurs during the dry season from december to april ponpang nga and techamahasaranont 2016 the mean annual air temperature is approximately 22 c and forest is the dominant land cover type which accounts for approximately 80 of the total area 2 2 observation data the data used in this study include daily climate forcing observations geographic information from the study area and daily streamflow measurements collected by three runoff gauges the climate forcing data include daily precipitation daily air temperature mean maximum and minimum daily mean relative humidity daily mean wind speed and daily sunshine duration data qin et al 2017 yang et al 2019 all climate forcing data except the wind speed were observed at 96 rainfall stations and 14 meteorological stations and were provided by the royal irrigation department of thailand within the chao phraya river basin these data were spatially interpolated into gridded images with a spatial resolution of 2 5 km 2 5 km by an angular distance weighting method with elevation corrections yang et al 2004 the spatial distributions of the daily wind speed 0 25 0 25 were obtained from the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 to match the spatial resolution of 2 5 km 2 5 km we resampled the original data by the nearest neighbor assignment using esri arcgis 10 6 software because the stochastic rainfall generator srg requires more than 20 years of historical records as raw materials we selected 57 rainfall stations within and around the study area among 96 rainfall stations which had more than 20 years of data available before january 1 2010 to generate synthetic data by srg the soil data of the ping river basin were obtained from the harmonized world soil database hwsd fao et al 2012 and the soil water parameters including the soil hydraulic conductivity saturated soil moisture and residual soil moisture were spatially interpolated using the methods proposed by rawls and brakensiek 1985 geomorphological information including the slope slope length and elevation was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 90 m jarvis et al 2008 the land use maps were provided by the department of land development of thailand and the vegetation parameters including the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar and the leaf area index lai are obtained from the 3rd generation normalized difference vegetation index ndvi3g of the global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms project zhu et al 2013 streamflow data at three stations including the gauge at the nawarat bridge referred to as gauge p1 the gauge in the chom thong referred to as gauge p73 and the gauge in the sam ngao district referred to as gauge p12 were selected to evaluate model performance the data were provided by the royal irrigation department of thailand gauge p1 is located near chiang mai in the upper ping river basin with a drainage area of 6355 km2 gauge p73 is located in the central portion of the ping river basin with a drainage area of 14 814 km2 gauge p12 is located at the basin outlet detailed information on the data used in this study is given in table 1 3 methodology 3 1 modeling approaches to overcome the limitations of previous ml based hydrological models we propose three corresponding modeling approaches and then develop a physical process and machine learning combined hydrological model in addition we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed modelling framework by comparing different data driven models step by step 3 1 1 three modeling approaches the main limitations of previous data driven models in hydrological simulations are the extensive data requirements ignoring catchment spatial variability and poor performance for extreme flow simulation accordingly we propose three modeling approaches to solve those drawbacks to overcome the need for large training data sets we propose a hydrologically guided modeling approach that can be regarded as a kind of physics guided data science method karpatne et al 2017 this approach combines a widely used physically distributed hydrological model a geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm yang et al 1998 with a stochastic rainfall generator srg basinger et al 2010 to generate sufficient physical synthetic data to train ml models specifically the srg is used to generate synthetic rainfall data and the calibrated gbhm model is used to generate corresponding runoff data with the synthetic rainfall data set used as the input this method can avoid the drawback of previous data driven models and allow the proposed model to be applied in basins for which long term hydrological observations are scarce the details of this method are provided in section 3 2 to consider the spatial heterogeneity of predictors we adopt a local binary pattern based computer vision method lbp cv ojala et al 1996 to extract the spatial features of predictors and use these spatial features as model inputs the lbp cv method is an effective feature representation algorithm especially for hydrological variables jiang et al 2018 and it can extract both texture and intensity features from gridded images the details of this method are provided in section 3 3 to effectively simulate high flows we propose a categorization approach ca which is similar to the approach introduced by sivapragasam and liong 2005 in particular this approach splits the training data into four sub datasets subsets of small medium large and extraordinarily large flows based on the relevant percentiles and then establishes separate ann models for each sub dataset for prediction during the test period we first use the trained random subspace ensemble k nearest neighbor rs knn classifier to predict the flow magnitude labels of streamflow data and then choose the corresponding ann model to predict the streamflow the ca can avoid the problem of insufficient training for high flows due to their low frequency in streamflow time series and can thus improve the high flow prediction capability of data driven models the details of the ann and rs knn are given in section 3 4 3 1 2 gbhm ann ca cv model we develop a physical process and ml combined hydrological model gbhm ann ca cv in this study for hydrological simulation and the modelling framework is shown in fig 2 the model mainly consists of four main steps the first step is data preprocessing which includes input variable selection training data generation and spatial feature extraction since this model is driven by gbhm generated synthetic data the same inputs are used the model inputs are composed of three types of variables including meteorological forcing variables vegetation parameters and catchment geomorphologic information qin et al 2017 yang et al 2002 the meteorological inputs include daily precipitation daily mean air temperature daily relative humidity and daily potential evapotranspiration calculated by the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 the vegetation input includes the lai which is linearly interpolated to a daily resolution the catchment geomorphologic inputs include the slope slope length and elevation derived from the dem since there is a delay from the start of a rainfall event to the time when runoff occurs and this lag time needs to be considered in model development we calculate the lag time 71 8 h 3 days of the ping basin according to the method suggested by the united states department of agriculture mockus 1964 and meteorological predictors with a 3 day lag time are adopted detailed information on the model inputs is given in table 2 after determining the model inputs the physically based synthetic data for model development are generated by using the srg and gbhm with the synthetic dataset the spatial features of input variables are extracted by lbp cv and concatenated to form a feature space for ml to avoid model overfitting we adopt principal component analysis pca to further reduce the dimensionality of the feature space pca is a widely used linear method for data reduction it tries to identify a small number of uncorrelated variables i e principal components that are the linear combination of origin variables the detail information of pca can be found in kramer 1998 we select streamflow at time step t as the response variable for the ml model and the result can be expressed as 1 q t f p t p t 1 p t 2 p t 3 t t t t 1 t t 2 t t 3 h t h t 1 h t 2 h t 3 e t e t 1 e t 2 e t 3 l a i t l a i t 1 l a i t 2 l a i t 3 s s l e l e where q is streamflow p is precipitation t is the mean air temperature h is the relative humidity and e is the potential evapotranspiration which are all functions of time and space variable s is the slope sl is the slope length and ele is the elevation these variables are only functions of space the second step is to train and validate the machine learning based models with the ca the third step is to predict the streamflow labels with a random subspace ensemble rs knn classifier and generate the predicted streamflow in the test period the synthetic precipitation and streamflow data are used to develop the rs knn classifier since precipitation has the most important impact on runoff generation the areal mean precipitation for the current day and previous three days and the 3 day cumulative areal mean precipitation are selected as the predictor variables for the classifier the magnitude of the streamflow labels is selected as the target variable since the number of measurements with small magnitude labels is far greater than the number of samples with other labels we simply reproduce the samples with these labels so that the number of samples is approximately equal for all label classes with the trained rs knn the magnitude labels of streamflow can be predicted and the fourth step is to choose the corresponding sub model to predict the streamflow on each day in the test period this label prediction approach can be expressed as 2 l t g p t p t 1 p t 2 p t 3 cp t cp t 1 cp t 2 cp t 3 where l is the label p is the areal mean precipitation cp is the 3 day cumulative areal mean precipitation and g represents the classifier we carry out a comparison of three data driven models for runoff simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the modelling framework the first is a simple ann with the same predictors as the gbhm ann ca cv and it is used as the baseline model the second is an ann model driven by gbhm generated synthetic data referred to as gbhm ann and the comparison between the ann and gbhm ann can be used to determine if the performance of the ml model driven by gbhm generated synthetic data is superior for data insufficient basins the third is an ann model coupled with a categorization approach driven by gbhm generated synthetic data referred to as gbhm ann ca and the comparison between gbhm ann ca and gbhm ann can be used to assess the effectiveness of the categorization approach in improving the capability of data driven models to simulate high flows the three models all use the areal mean values of predictor variables instead of spatial features the comparison between gbhm ann ca and gbhm ann ca cv can be used to explore the effects of spatial variability on the robustness of data driven hydrological models for models driven by gbhm generated synthetic data we use 48 year synthetic data for training and 12 year synthetic data for validation for models driven by observations we use the observations from 1 january 1990 to 31 december 2005 for training and the observations from 1 january 2006 to 31 december 2009 for validation the streamflow values at three runoff gauges i e p1 p73 and p12 from 1 january 2010 to 31 december 2016 are predicted by all four models in this study for testing we use three different criteria to evaluate the overall performance of the models the root mean square errors rmse the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 nse is a normalized statistical index with a value between 0 and 1 and a larger value indicates a better simulation pbias reflects the overall flow bias error and a value close to 0 indicates a good simulation it is commonly acknowledged that the performance of hydrological models is considered satisfactory if nse greater than 0 50 and 15 pbias 15 for daily streamflow simulation moriasi et al 2007 the model performance for low flow simulations is typically evaluated based on the logarithmic transformed nash sutcliffe efficiency lnse smakhtin et al 1998 and the performance of peak flow simulation is evaluated by the peak error pe which is just the percent bias of the peak the peak flow events in streamflow series are identified by the peaks over threshold pot method and a threshold that leads to three events per year is adopted in this study the details of the pot method can be found in the previous study of mediero et al 2014 3 2 synthetic data by srg and gbhm we generate a training and validation dataset by combining the srg and gbhm to alleviate the limitations of previous ml based hydrological models in data insufficient areas specifically we use the srg to obtain synthetic rainfall data and the gbhm to obtain the corresponding streamflow samples 3 2 1 stochastic rainfall generator we use a nonparametric approach srg developed by basinger et al 2010 which uses a bootstrapped markov chain to generate synthetic series based on a user specified historical record of daily rainfall and maintains the statistical characteristics of the historical rainfall the method includes three major steps the first step is to calculate the occurrence probabilities of precipitation for each day in historical sequences the precipitation on each day in the historical series is assigned a dry or wet label with dry representing a zero value of precipitation and wet representing a positive value to describe the occurrence statistics of historical precipitation we calculate three types of probabilities for each day in the historical series with the following equations 3 prob w w w d 4 prob w w ww ww w d 5 prob d d dd dw d d where prob w is the probability of a wet day prob w w is the conditional probability of a wet day following a wet day and prob d d is the conditional probability of a dry day following a dry day letter w is the number of wet days d is the number of dry days ww is the number of wet days following wet days wd is the number of dry days following wet days dd is the number of dry days following dry days and dw is the number of wet days following dry days for each day of the year the second step is to assign dry wet labels to each day in all years of the simulated series considering the seasonality of rainfall the label for each day is assigned according to the label of the previous day for a day with a dry label the simulated precipitation is zero for a day with a wet label the amount of rain is randomly selected from the historical precipitation amounts with specific consideration of seasonality this rainfall generator can ensure the seasonality of synthetic series and avoid the occurrence of unreasonable prediction values the detailed calculation process was presented by basinger et al 2010 we use the srg method to generate synthetic rainfall time series for the 57 selected rainfall stations based on their 20 year historical observations since precipitation is the main factor in runoff generation we only generate synthetic rainfall series and other meteorological variables are still based on historical observations we obtain corresponding synthetic climate forcing data and spatially interpolate these data to gridded images with a spatial resolution of 2 5 km 2 5 km using an angular distance weighting method with elevation corrections yang et al 2004 3 2 2 geomorphology based hydrological model the gbhm is a distributed hydrological model developed by yang et al 1998 and it mainly consists of hydrological simulations in each hillslope unit and river routing along river networks the simulations in each unit mainly involve calculations of evapotranspiration canopy interception surface flow infiltration unsaturated flow and groundwater flow river routing is calculated by kinematic wave methods and the total runoff at the outlet of each sub catchment can be obtained by summing the runoff contributions in each grid detailed descriptions of the model were given by yang et al 1998 and yang et al 2002 we use the gbhm in this study to simulate the hydrological processes in the ping river basin to reflect the real physical situation in the study area we first calibrate and validate the gbhm using historical observations the spatial resolution of the model is chosen as 2 5 km 2 5 km and the entire basin is split into 58 sub catchments the model is activated and initialized with a 6 year warm up period and the daily streamflow data at p12 from 1 january 2000 to 31 december 2004 are used to calibrate parameters including the slope shape factor groundwater hydraulic conductivity and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the topsoil miao et al 2016 we use the data from 1 january 2005 to 31 december 2009 to validate the model after calibration and validation the developed gbhm can be assumed to reflect the real hydrological processes in the region and can be used to generate streamflow samples second with synthetic climate forcing data points as inputs the calibrated model is used to generate synthetic streamflow series for model development in data insufficient basins 3 3 spatial features extracted by computer vision cv algorithms this study uses cv algorithms to obtain the spatial features of the predictor images specifically the texture feature is extracted by the local binary pattern lbp algorithm developed by jiang et al 2018 and the intensity feature is represented by the areal mean of pixel values for a 3 3 pixel block the values of 8 neighboring pixels are first transformed to 0 or 1 using the value at the center pixel as the threshold then an 8 bit binary code is indexed for the center pixel the corresponding decimal of this 8 bit binary code is referred to as the lbp value at the center pixel and the lbp value of each pixel over an image can then be calculated to describe the statistical characteristics of the lbp values in an image a histogram is usually used and the number of bins in the histograms can be set to range from 1 to 256 in this study considering the computational complexity the number of bins is set to 15 and the texture feature of an image is represented by a 15 dimensional histogram vector detailed descriptions of the lbp method and its applications were given by ojala et al 1996 khan et al 2020 and kaya et al 2014 here we use a spatial pyramid matching spm strategy lazebnik et al 2006 to capture the spatial layout of the texture and intensity features for the three level spm used in this study each image is split into 1 2 2 4 21 21 and 16 22 22 sub images and the spatial features 15 dimensional texture vector and 1 dimensional intensity vector are independently extracted from each sub image all the sub image features are concatenated to create a feature vector with a dimension of 336 1 4 16 15 1 finally the spatial features of all 23 input variables see eq 1 are concatenated and a feature space with a dimension of 8418 23 366 is generated we use the pca method to further reduce the dimensionality of the feature space and a 118 dimensional input feature space is finally obtained with a 95 explained variability the details of the spm strategy were reported by lazebnik et al 2006 and the detailed process of image spatial feature extraction with the lbp cv and spm methods is described by jiang et al 2018 3 4 machine learning methods we use two ml methods for regression and classification ann and rs knn classifiers we split the synthetic data into training 80 and validation 20 sets to determine whether the model effectively learned the behavior of the gbhm for all three gauges the observation data from 1 january 2010 to 31 december 2016 were used to test the prediction capability of the models the test period included extreme floods 2011 3 4 1 artificial neural network ann we use a three layer ann with initial conditions optimized by a genetic algorithm ga for hydrological simulations in which ga is used to optimize the initial conditions the detailed architecture of the ann was presented by yang et al 2019 and more details of the ga were provided by wang 1991 in this study we use the mean square error mse as the loss function and the nse as the objective function for the optimization of the initial conditions we adopt the levenberg marquardt lm method for neural network training in addition the tanh function is used as the activation function in this study and the model is implemented with matlab software beale et al 1992 3 4 2 ensemble k nearest neighbor rs knn classifier in this study the streamflow data are separated into four sub datasets including those for small medium large and extraordinarily large flows and the separation is determined based on the 80th 95th and 98th percentiles of the flow frequency distribution curve obtained from historical observations sun et al 2008 the 80th percentile is used to distinguish the small and medium flow the 95th percentile is used to distinguish the medium and large flows and the 98th percentile is used to distinguish the large and extraordinarily large flows under the separation criteria the streamflow on each day is assigned a corresponding flow magnitude label we use the random subspace ensemble k nearest neighbor classifier rs knn to predict the magnitude labels i e small medium large or extraordinarily large of the streamflow for each day in the test period the k nearest neighbor knn aha et al 1991 classifier is used to predict the membership of objects based on the closest training instances in the feature space yang et al 2012 the k closest neighbors of an instance are defined according to the pearson correlation coefficient and the label value of each instance is determined based on these neighbors with the majority vote principle yang et al 2011 as a popular ensemble learning method the random subspace algorithm includes bootstrapping and aggregation in the feature space chen et al 2019 this approach can improve the efficiency and accuracy of classification compared to the values using a single classifier kuncheva et al 2010 by combining rs and knn the rs knn classifier randomly divides the entire feature space into several subspaces and the knn classifier is trained for each subspace the final ensemble decision is generated according to the majority vote principle the details of the rs knn classifier were reported by kuncheva et al 2010 and the classifier was implemented with matlab software 4 results in this section we present the calibration and validation results of the gbhm and compare the performance of four data driven models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the modelling framework proposed in this study the prediction capability of the proposed model is examined with the data observed from 1 january 2010 to 31 december 2016 in the study area 4 1 calibration and validation of gbhm we first calibrate and validate the gbhm using data from three stations fig 3 and table 3 show the streamflow simulations for three gauges obtained with the gbhm in the calibration and validation periods at gauge p1 the model achieves a high nse value of 0 79 and a slight underestimation with a pbias of 9 6 for the daily discharge in the calibration period additionally the nse is 0 68 and the pbias value is 4 3 in the validation period at gauge p73 the model achieves a high nse value of 0 80 and a slight underestimation with a pbias of 9 2 in the calibration period in the validation period the nse is 0 78 and pbias is 12 3 at gauge p12 the nse values are 0 79 and 0 84 and the pbias values are 7 83 and 4 76 in the calibration and validation periods respectively the results show that the calibrated gbhm model can effectively describe the hydrological processes in the ping river basin and be used to generate streamflow time series 4 2 results of the synthetic studies to evaluate how three proposed modeling approaches are effective we use the simulation results of the simple ann by using limited observations as the baseline and design three experiments including streamflow simulations by gbhm ann gbhm ann ca and gbhm ann ca cv with synthetic data before showing the results of the four models we summarize the performance of the rs knn classifier in table 4 during the training validation and test periods the rs knn performs well for the three gauges with correct percentages of more than 90 these results indicate that the classifier can accurately predict the magnitude labels of streamflow according to precipitation information as a baseline model the simple ann is trained and validated with 20 year observations we consider the number of hidden neurons as a tuning parameter and select it from a preset of ranges between 5 and 30 for each value we run for 20 times and the maximum nse among the 20 times is taken as the representative value we use the same tuning method for all the ml models in this study after adjusting hyperparameters we use architectures with 12 hidden neurons for gauge p1 10 hidden neurons for gauge p12 and 15 hidden neurons for gauge p1 the results are shown in fig 4 and table 5 the simple ann adequately simulates the streamflow at gauge p12 but false simulations are generated at gauges p1 and p73 the difference in performance for the three gauges indicates that the ann model lacks robustness which may be caused by ignoring the spatial variability of predictors in addition the ann performs poorly under both low flow and peak flow conditions and significantly underestimates the peak flows at all three gauges likely due to the inadequacy of training data for the extreme flood in 2011 mateo et al 2015 the ann model is unable to simulate the event at all three gauges and significantly underestimates the peak flow with pe values greater than 49 although the ann is an easy to use method that requires only several seconds to run 10 year simulations it must be improved to be a surrogate model of the gbhm to overcome the problem of inadequate training data physically based synthetic data are generated by the gbhm and srg for model training and validation to determine the suitable lengths of synthetic time series data for model training and validation we calculate the performance i e nse during the test period of gbhm ann using different lengths of synthetic data the synthetic data are split into training 80 of data for initially fitting and validation 20 of data for hyper parameter tuning sets according to a commonly adopted 80 20 split rule yang et al 2016 and all models are tested with the climate forcing observations and corresponding gbhm generated streamflow data from 1 january 2010 to 31 december 2016 as shown in fig 5 it can be seen that the simulations become stable with an acceptable accuracy nse 0 7 when the data lengths were more than 60 years the 60 year synthetic data are shown in fig 6 here we emphatically introduce the simulation results of gbhm ann with 60 year synthetic data it should be clarified that the performance of the gbhm ann is evaluated based on a comparison of the gbhm ann simulations and synthetic runoff data the architecture of the gbhm ann includes 25 hidden neurons for gauge p1 24 hidden neurons for gauge p12 and 28 hidden neurons for gauge p1 after adjusting hyperparameters with the same parameter adjustment method as that used by simple ann the results of gbhm ann are shown in fig 7 and table 5 the model performs satisfactorily at all three gauges during the test period while an unbalanced performance of the model at the three gauges still exists with a worse simulation at gauge p1 for the extreme flood in 2011 the gbhm ann provides a better flood simulation result with higher nse and lower pbias values but significantly underestimates the peak flow at the three gauges with large pe values more than 30 although the significant peak flow underestimations have been greatly mitigated the peak flow simulation is still unsatisfactory with high pe values this issue must be addressed in the next modeling step to improve the ability of gbhm ann to simulate high flows a categorization approach is used and gbhm ann ca is developed the architecture of gbhm ann ca includes 12 hidden neurons for small magnitude modules 10 hidden neurons for medium magnitude modules 5 hidden neurons for large magnitude modules and 5 hidden neurons for extraordinarily large magnitude modules at all three gauges after the adjustment of hyperparameters with the same parameter adjustment method as simple ann fig 8 and table 5 show the simulation results and performance of gbhm ann ca with the support of ca the performance of the model can be judged as satisfactory at all three gauges and the simulation of peak flow and low flow has been improved greatly in terms of the extreme flood in 2011 gbhm ann ca provides a satisfactory result for peak flows with a low pe less than 15 but significantly overestimates the peak flow at gauge p73 with a high pe value of 27 1 this overestimation at p73 may be caused by the sparsity of rainfall gauges in addition a relatively large difference between peak flow simulations at three gauges still exists and needs to be improved in the next modeling step to improve the robustness of gbhm ann ca lbp cv is used to extract the spatial features and gbhm ann ca cv is proposed the architectures of the four modules have 25 hidden neurons in the hidden layer after hyperparameter adjustment with the same parameter adjustment method as simple ann as shown in fig 9 and table 5 the model can learn the hydrological behavior of the gbhm with a good performance and the model performance levels for the three gauges are satisfactory with nse values greater than 0 85 and pbias values less than 15 in terms of model performance for low flow and peak flow simulations the lnse values are all greater than 0 65 and the pe values are all less than 15 at three gauges for the extreme flood in 2011 gbhm ann ca cv exhibit satisfactory performances with high nse greater than 0 8 and low pbias less than 15 values 4 3 results of a real case study after examining the model performance in learning the hydrological behavior of the gbhm the gbhm ann ca cv model can be regarded as the best surrogate model for the gbhm and the prediction capability of the model needs to be investigated with real data therefore we compare the gbhm ann ca cv simulations with observations at the three gauges as shown in fig 10 and table 6 since gbhm ann ca cv is driven by gbhm generated synthetic data its prediction capability will not exceed that of the gbhm thus we also compare the observations and simulations of the gbhm during the test period the results show that both the gbhm and gbhm ann ca cv yield satisfactory performances at the three gauges although the prediction accuracy of gbhm ann ca cv is lower than that of gbhm with nse values that are approximately 10 higher in low flow prediction the prediction accuracy of gbhm ann ca cv is also lower than that of the gbhm with lnse values that are approximately 15 higher in terms of peak flow prediction there are slight underestimations in the gbhm results and slight overestimations in the gbhm ann ca cv results at p1 and p73 and there are significant underestimations in both the gbhm and gbhm ann ca cv results at p12 in terms of the computing cost the total computational time is greatly reduced by ml it takes on the order of tens of seconds to run the 10 year simulation using the gbhm ann ca cv model and it takes on the order of tens of hours for the 10 year simulation using the gbhm model the considerable improvement in the computational time can be useful for practical water resource management especially for real time streamflow forecasting and flash flood warnings 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of different modeling approaches 1 effectiveness of the hydrological mechanisms guided modeling approach to demonstrate the effectiveness of hydrological mechanism guided modeling approaches we compare the performances of the gbhm ann with those of a simple ann gbhm ann which adopts sufficient synthetic data for training and validation performs better at all three gauges the nse values of the simulation results at the three gauges are improved by an average of 23 during the test period specifically with sufficient training data the significant underestimation of peak flow has been alleviated this comparison suggests that physically based hydrological models can greatly improve the performance of data driven models when historical observations are limited 2 effectiveness of the categorization approach we compare the performance of gbhm ann ca and gbhm ann to demonstrate the effectiveness of the categorization approaches gbhm ann ca is superior since it has much higher nse and lower pbias values and a better performance under both low flow and peak flow conditions by using separate sub datasets for the simulation the ca avoids the insufficient training of high and low flows caused by their low frequencies in flow series and thus improves the nse values by an average of 27 during the test period at the three gauges the results show that the ca based gbhm ann model can significantly improve the effectiveness of the peak flow simulation 3 effectiveness of the spatial information extracted by the lbp cv method compared with the robust performance of gbhm ann ca cv for peak flow simulation the pe values of the gbhm ann ca simulation show a significant overestimation for gauge p73 and a slight underestimation for gauges p1 and p12 considering the spatial variability of the predictors the lbp cv method solves the performance differences of gbhm ann ca at the three gauges and improves the nse values of all the three gauges by an average of 2 during the test period the results highlight that the spatial feature information extracted by the lbp cv approach can improve the simulation results especially for peak flow simulations 5 2 simulation uncertainties of gbhm ann ca cv we argue that the simulation uncertainties of the gbhm ann ca cv model mainly come from the gbhm model and the ml methods adopted in the model the error of the gbhm mainly comes from the uncertainties associated with the model parameters model structure and meteorological inputs li et al 2012 since the soil depth and soil types were obtained from the hwsd dataset with a relatively low spatial resolution the heterogeneity of the soil information may not be fully captured at the regional scale and thus the estimated soil parameters may be influenced by large uncertainties limited by the understanding of hydrological processes the model structure cannot fully describe real hydrological processes with high accuracy and this limitation can result in uncertainties additionally limited by the number of meteorological stations in the study area the spatial interpolation of the meteorological predictors is a relatively uncertain process and may increase the simulation error the error in ml mainly comes from the uncertainties of label prediction with the rs knn and the streamflow prediction with the ann in the future since remote sensing can effectively capture the spatial heterogeneity of meteorological variables remote sensing data can be used in the model thus reducing the model uncertainties in addition compared with the physically based hydrological model the model proposed in this study is unable to simultaneously provide discharge simulations for different catchments future studies need to explore how to develop a fully distributed data driven hydrological model that not only considers the spatial heterogeneity of predictors but also provides distributed hydrological simulations 6 conclusion this study proposed three approaches to improve the prediction capability of machine learning based hydrological models and developed a physical process and ml combined hydrological model for rainfall runoff simulation in data insufficient watersheds the model performance in learning the hydrological behaviors of the physically distributed hydrological model was evaluated with a synthetic dataset and the prediction capability was investigated using real data according to the results we developed the following conclusions 1 driven by the synthetic data generated by a distributed hydrological model the performance of the ml based data driven model was greatly improved for daily runoff simulations in watersheds with limited historical runoff observations by using the long term time series generated by the gbhm and srg the insufficient training problem that often occurs in daily streamflow simulations due to data scarcity can be overcome and the nse values were improved by an average of 23 during the test period 2 the streamflow categorization approach greatly improved the peak flow simulation capability of the data driven hydrological model and the nse values were improved by 27 on average during the test period this approach is potentially useful for real time water resource management especially for flood and drought prediction 3 the cv methods used in this study can effectively capture the spatial heterogeneity of predictors which can significantly improve the robustness of data driven hydrological models for rainfall runoff simulations in large river basins 4 the model developed in this study can effectively learn the hydrological behaviors of physically based distributed hydrological models e g the gbhm and can be applied for long term daily streamflow simulation and prediction in large data insufficient catchments in addition with the rapid development of computer technology and artificial intelligence the modelling framework proposed in this study can be improved in the future with enhancements in physically distributed

5131,nutrients are critical to the development of plant and animal life in the river ecological system in recent years more attentions have arisen on the impact of building hydropower dams to transborder nutrient flux in the lancang mekong river basin lmrb in this paper phosphorus was taken as an example which is considered as one of the most significant factors to limit biological activities in the river the soil and water assessment tool swat was used to access the multisource loading pattern of total phosphorus tp under no dam scenario and various types of dam construction scenarios analyses were performed to investigate potential changes in the transborder tp flux from lancang river basin lrb chinese part of lmrb to lower lmrb other parts of lmrb the results showed that the total phosphorus load in the lrb is about 27 079 tons year of which 85 tp is collected from july to october the annual tp export at the outlet of the lrb is 14 112 tons year under no dam scenario which accounts for about 4 2 of the total tp loads in the lower lmrb with seven to twenty one dams included in experiments tp flux at the outlet of the lrb decreased 50 59 while the delivered ratio for the lower lmrb decreased 2 1 2 5 as a summary building dams has a significant impact on the tp transport pattern in the chinese part of lmrb but very limited effect in lower lmrb according to the modeling results especially for the mekong delta moreover the existing dams seven dams seem to intercept much more phosphorus than those dams that are under construction keywords lancang mekong river phosphorus influence of dam construction nutrient retention swat model 1 introduction the lancang mekong river is the largest transborder river in asia which originates from the southwest region of china and runs through myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam the upstream part of the river within the border of china is referred to as the lancang river basin lrb the lancang mekong river basin lmrb maintains incredible biodiversity with approximately 1200 to 1700 fish species dudgeon 2000 2002 mrc 2007 and provides over 50 of the protein demanded by the 60 million people living in this basin mainly in the lower basin cochrane et al 2014 keskinen et al 2015 mrc 2015 the river acts as a home for rare and threatened wildlife species that depend on its streamflow such as the irrawaddy dolphin siamese crocodile and giant catfish mrc 2005 therefore it is essential to avoid devastating changes in the flow regime and preserve water quality under the stresses of population growth economic development deforestation and dam construction nutrients are essential inputs for riverine ecosystems but high levels of nutrients may lead to nutrient enrichment changes in algal and fish ecology deterioration of drinking water and other consequences wang et al 2019 conley et al 2009 somura et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 on the other hand nutrient starvation can impede environmental development of ecosystems due to the limitation for biological growth guildford et al 2007 nixon 2003 rattan 2017 von schiller et al 2016 phosphorus nitrogen carbon and silicon are common nutrients that support aquatic habitats among them phosphorus has a critical role in genetic systems and in the storage and transfer of cell energy which are essential to all lives elser et al 2007 maavara et al 2015 however phosphorus is usually in short supply in natural relative to other macronutrients and has been demonstrated to be a limiting nutrient for many ecological systems brett and benjamin 2007 chapra 1997 maavara et al 2015 for the lancang mekong river recent studies have also found that phytoplankton growth and biological activities are broadly limited by the amount of phosphorus burnett et al 2017 fan et al 2015 li and bush 2015 wu et al 2014 transborder delivery of riverine nutrients has been a critical water issue in many parts of the world such as the sava river across slovenia croatia bosnia herzegovina serbia levi et al 2018 the vilija river across belarus and lithuania čerkasova et al 2018 the nisa river across germany poland and czech republic kaendler et al 2017 and the tigris river across turkey and iraq varol 2013 for the lancang mekong river debates have existed long regards to the impact of human activities on the transport of nutrients some studies reported increased levels of nutrients due to population growth agricultural development urbanization and climate change which may result in an eutrophic status in the lower region of the lmrb trang et al 2017 oeurng et al 2016 yoshimura et al 2009 some other studies were concerned about dam construction especially for those large chinese dams in lrb a worry exists that the interception of nutrients by the cascade dams of lrb may impair the ecological function of the lower mekong delta fang et al 2015 kuenzer et al 2013 wei et al 2009 wild et al 2016 the studies mentioned above showed contradicted viewpoints one concerns about excessive nutrients while the other put emphasis on nutrients starvation to address the above mentioned contradicted problems one key question to answer is whether the transborder nutrients flux from the lrb accounts for a significant portion of the total nutrients loading of the entire basin and to what extent the cascade dams would change the contribution however this question remains to be unaddressed taking phosphorous for an example some studies estimated the total phosphorus tp loading of the entire lrmb yoshimura et al 2009 or the loading of certain sub basins in the lower lmrb oeurng et al 2016 trang et al 2017 however few studies have performed a detailed calculation on the tp loading in the lrb and there has been no quantitative analysis of the dams impact on the tp loading this study assessed the transborder flux of total phosphorus tp from the lrb chinese part of lmrb to the lower region of lmrb other parts of lmrb and investigated the impacts of dam construction a process based watershed model swat was developed to estimate the tp loads in lrb various data were collected to implement the model including the land use data soil map meteorological data digital elevation model dem socio economic data relative to point and non point sources discharge sediment and water quality data observed streamflow the primary study objectives are 1 to achieve a holistic understanding of the transborder phosphorous transport in the lrb using model data fusion 2 to investigate the potential changes in the transborder tp flux under different scenarios of dam construction and 3 to examine the relevance of the transborder tp flux as well as its potential changes to the downstream region lower region of lmrb the results of the study can provide vital information to avoid misunderstandings and mitigate disputes about the impacts of the cascade reservoirs in china and to generate insights into the management of water energy and ecosystems in the lancang mekong river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region the lancang river lies upstream of the lancang mekong river fig 1 a and its mainstream is 2161 km long the lancang river basin lrb has an area of approximately 156 978 km2 which contributes to about 20 of the area and 16 of the runoff of the entire lancang mekong river basin lmrb the lrb spans latitudes from n33 to n21 and altitudes from 5500 m to 2500 m with various climate characteristics across the basin the precipitation and temperature increase from the north to south and show various annual distribution patterns in different catchments the upstream region from the river source to changdu city has a temperate plateau climate with an average temperature of 10 c and annual precipitation of 400 800 mm the midstream of the river from changdu city to the gongguoqiao reservoir has a sub tropical climate with an average temperature of 12 15 c and an annual rainfall of 1000 2500 mm the boundaries between upstream midstream and downstream are shown in fig s1 of the supplemental materials the downstream region has a tropical climate with an average temperature of 15 22 c and annual precipitation of 1000 3000 mm in the lancang mekong river basin the wet season occurs from june to october which accounts for more than 80 of the annual rainfall the dry season occurs from november to may the major land use types of the river basin are grassland and forest fig 1c which account for 43 0 and 41 2 of the total basin area respectively cultivated lands of corn rice potato and wheat account for 7 0 1 4 0 3 and 0 1 of the total area respectively barren land water areas wetlands rural residential areas and urban land accounts for the left 7 of the total area according to fig 1b most grassland is in the north while most forest is in the south farmland is concentrated in the lower middle part of the basin where human activities are intense mainly including industrial wastewater streamflow and animal feedlots there are twenty one reservoirs along the main channel of the lancang river and seven of them see fig 1a were completed before 2018 fan et al 2015 wang et al 2017 two reservoirs with annual regulation capacities xiaowan xw and nuozhadu nzd reservoirs are the most important ones due to large storage the water quality of the mainstream lancang river is often rated as grade ii or iii e g grades i ii and iii are suitable for drinking because fewer pollution sources are associated with the less developed regional economy in the basin fan et al 2015 the tp concentration is very low from october to may in most reaches of the mainstream but sometimes increased from may to august near the xiaowan reservoir wu et al 2014 wei et al 2009 2 2 the swat model and data swat soil water assessment tool is semi distributed dynamic and physically based tool that can be used to perform long term continuous simulation of watershed hydrology and water quality arnold et al 1998 swat has been widely used to model the impact of land management practices on water movement sediment movement crop growth and nutrient cycling in large complex watersheds wu and chen 2013 gassman et al 2014 srinivasan et al 1998 trang et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 in this study a swat model was developed to assess the multisource loads of total phosphorus tp in the lrb in the model lrb is delineated into 381 sub basins which include in total 2436 hydrological response units hrus we divide the time scale into the warmup period from the year 1978 to the year 1979 and model simulation period from the year 1980 to the year 2014 surface runoff and sediments play essential roles in phosphorus transport most phosphorus is adsorbed by sediment and erosion of soil particles that remove phosphorus from fields brett and benjamin 2007 liu et al 2015 molina navarro et al 2018 neitsch et al 2009 thus the swat model in this study simulates both streamflow and riverine sediment loading besides the instream tp concentration table 1 summarizes the data used for the model development to set up the swat model the original land use and land cover lulc data was reclassified into several swat categories the soil map was taken from the soil databases that was produced by the nanjing institute of soil science the properties of each soil type were determined based on the chinese soil database shi et al 2010 yu et al 2007 except that the available water capacity sol awc saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k and moist bulk density sol bd of soils were estimated using the soil plant atmosphere water spaw software jiang et al 2014 wei et al 2007 daily meteorological data during the time period from the year1978 to the year 2014 was collected from 33 weather stations information of crop management practices including the timing of planting fertilizer application and harvest was obtained via field surveys with farmers in the study region and was used to prepare the management files of the swat model industrial and domestic wastewaters referred to as idw are lumped into one source and the monthly volumes and tp concentrations of the wastewater were collected from the statistical yearbooks of the three provinces covered by the basin pollutant loads from animal feedlot and rural household referred to as afrh are also grouped into one category the export coefficient method which has been widely used in large scale studies bowes et al 2008 is adopted to estimate the tp load from afrh the tp loads from both idw and afrh were estimated for each of the 43 counties in total within the basin and then each county was conceptualized as a point source discharging to the river system as these counties are among the least developed areas in china the change in socio economic conditions in lrb had not been significant from the year 2009 to the year 2014 thus it is appropriate to use the load estimates of the year 2014 as the model inputs for the calibration period from the year 2009 to the year 2012 of tp according to the available observed data the swat model output files were calculated monthly for the model calibration and validation monthly flow measurements from the year 1980 to the year 2008 and sediment load measurements from the year 1980 to the year 1986 were obtained at three hydrological stations jiuzhou jiajiu and yunjinghong as indicated in fig 1a along the mainstream manwan reservoir mw was the only reservoir that was built up in the year 1993 within the observation period from the year 1980 to the year 2008 to eliminate the impact of mw on the flow regime after the year 1993 back calculation from the actual flow measurements to the natural flow conditions was performed based on the historical information of mw s operation during 1993 to 2008 see details in supporting information text s1 observations of tp concentration are very scarce since we only collected nine monthly observations in the period of the year 2009 to the year 2012 at the entrance of the gongguoqiao reservoir ggq before 2012 ggq was the leading reservoir of the cascade reservoir system thus the tp concentration measured at this location would not be impacted by the cascade reservoirs eventually the swat model was calibrated and validated for streamflow sediment and tp under the no reservoir condition and the information is presented in table 2 for the streamflow the calibration period is from the year 1980 to the year 2002 while the validation period is from the year 2003 to the year 2008 except that the validation period at yunjinghong station is from the year 2003 to the year 2006 due to the lack of the data from the year 2007 to the year 2008 for the sediment loads the calibration period is from the year 1980 to the year 1984 while the validation period is from the year 1985 to the year 1986 for tp only calibration was performed due to the scarcity of observed data the swat model was calibrated for streamflow sediment and tp consequently eleven and five sensitive parameters were considered in the calibrations of streamflow and sediment respectively according to a test of sensitivity and previous research experience abbaspour et al 2007 li et al 2010 zheng and han 2016 oeurng et al 2016 yang et al 2016 kalcic et al 2016 their initial ranges and calibrated values are listed in table 3 it should be noted that a distributed parameter pattern was adopted in the calibration of streamflow and sediment some parameters e g alpha bf have different values for different sub basins which were calibrated according to three hydrologic stations meanwhile some other parameters e g usle c and sol awc have different values according to different land covers soil types or soil layers as shown via the superscripts a and b in table 3 the calibration of streamflow and sediment was performed using an automated calibration tool soil and water assessment tool calibration and uncertainty procedure swat cup designed for swat abbaspour 2011 for each calibration task three iterations of swat cup were applied and each iteration ran 400 swat simulations to identify an optimal parameter set as well as to achieve updated parameter ranges narrower than the initial ones parameter ranges resulted from the previous iteration are then considered as the initial ranges for the subsequent iteration four sensitive parameters for the simulation of tp were selected after a test of sensitivity for the lrb table 3 the selected parameters were manually tuned due to the observational data of tp concentration is too scarce to perform an automated calibration in the adjustment process the match between the order of magnitude of the simulated and the observed values was preferred and then the variation trend of total phosphorus was focused it was found that erorgp has the greatest influence on the order of magnitude of the simulated total phosphorus the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient is used as the objective function to evaluate the model performance a value of 1 0 represents a perfect fit of the model for the swat simulation while the values of 0 5 0 65 and 0 75 can be considered as satisfactory good or very good fit of the model respectively moriasi et al 2007 2 3 mass balance of tp in the cascade reservoirs a phosphorus mass balance model was used to calculate the tp retention in the reservoirs brett and benjamin 2007 maavara et al 2015 vollenweider 1975 the mass balance of tp is formulated as 1 d m d t l σ m q v m where m kg is the total mass of tp in the reservoir t is time step 0 01 month in this study l kg year 1 is inflow flux of tp to the reservoir v m3 is the storage volume of the reservoir q m3 year 1 is the outflow flux from the reservoir and σ year 1 is a first order rate constant describing tp loss from water column which is related to the relative thickness of the photic zone and the average particle settling velocity the parameter σ was suggested as 0 801 y 1 by maavara et al 2015 according to regression analysis but this value contains high uncertainty an uncertainty analysis is therefore necessary to make the model results meaningful zheng and keller 2007 this study considers a range of 0 5 10 y 1 for σ which well reflects the significant uncertainty of this parameter indicated by previous studies brett and benjamin 2007 chapra 1997 labaugh 1985 maavara et al 2015 the tp mass balance model was performed with runge kutta 4 integration and 0 01 month time step maavara et al 2015 monte carlo simulations with 2000 samples were performed to calculate the annual tp retention from the year 1980 to the year 2014 in each different experiment the monte carlo simulations assumed a uniform distribution of σ within the pre defined range and all the reservoirs were sampled independently the range of 2000 experimental samples and corresponding statistical values were given in the result section each reservoir except the leading reservoir in a cascade reservoirs system receives tp loads from both its drainage area and its upstream reservoir in this study the watershed tp loads were simulated using swat model and the upstream tp loads were calculated using the mass balance model 2 4 scenarios of dam construction and operation this study investigates how the ongoing dam constructions in lrb would impact lrb s tp export to the lower lancang mekong river basin based on swat simulations table 4 provides information of the twenty one dams planned along the mainstream the storage capacities of the reservoirs awaiting construction are still undetermined and thus they are estimated according to the designed installed capacities as well as the existing reservoirs with similar installed capacities for example huangdeng reservoir has a designed installed capacity of 190 104 kw and a designed storage of 14 2 108 m3 while tuoba reservoir has a designed installed capacity of 140 104 kw then the storage of tuoba reservoir awaiting construction was estimated to be 10 4 108 m3 the flood control level is the limited water level for preventing flood risks during a flood season from july to october in this basin which is normally lower than or equal to the normal water level the swat model provides the values of mean annual streamflow and results are illustrated in table 4 seven dams miaowei gongguoqiao xiaowan manwan dachaoshan nuozhadu and jinghong shown in fig 1 a as green triangles have been built before year 2018 and five of them wunonglong lidi huangdeng dahuaqiao and ganlanba dams shown in fig 1 a as brown triangles are still under construction the rest of the dams such as cege yuelong kagong banda rumei guxue gushui tuoba and mensong dams shown in fig 1 a as black triangles are still waiting for the construction permission due to social economic and environmental concerns to better understand the impact of reservoirs on the tp flux ten numerical experiments were conducted using different combinations of dam construction scenario and reservoir operation scheme see table 5 four dam construction scenarios were evaluated 1 the baseline scenario with no dams representing the nature condition 2 the scenario with the seven completed dams representing the current situation 3 the scenario with the seven completed dams and five dams that are under construction representing the recent planning situation 4 and the scenario with all twenty one dams representing the forward planning situation which are denoted as bs dcs 7 dcs 12 dcs 21 respectively in each dam construction scenario except the baseline scenario three operation schemes were hypothesized since most of the dams have not been completed and no real operational data are available in scheme i all the reservoirs keep their normal storage levels during non flood seasons and their flood control levels during the flood season respectively in order to keep high water heads for power generating schemes ii and iii are both obtained from a previous study chen et al 2014 in scheme ii xw and nzd the only two reservoirs with annual regulating capacity are operated as a function of the designed target storage of each month while other reservoirs are operated as in scheme i due to their small storage capacities and low level abilities in regulating the streamflow the target storages of xw and nzd are designed aiming at maximizing the total power generation in cascade reservoirs which are presented as the reservoir operation chart the detailed description about the reservoir operation chart and the reservoir optimal operation model was given by chen et al 2014 scheme iii is similar to scheme ii except that the reservoir operation chart is designed for maximizing the generation guaranteed ratio the reliability of power generation take the completed dam construction scenario as an example the experiment ids under three operation schemes are denoted as dcs 7 i dcs 7 ii dcs 7 iii respectively 2 5 the simulation procedure and analytical methods the swat model was first calibrated and validated under the bs scenario without dams according to the collected data the results are shown in section 3 1 in sections 3 2 and 3 3 a holistic map of the phosphorus loading and the source attribution of phosphorus in the lrb to demonstrate the bs scenario which aims to reveal the phosphorus transport pattern in the lancang river without dams there are four primary sources of tp in the study area soil weathering and erosion swe agricultural fertilization af idw and afrh multiple runs of the swat model with different scenarios of pollution source inputs were conducted to isolate and estimate the amount of tp load from each source the swat model was first run without any pollution sources except that the soil weathering and erosion process is modeled in this case the instreams tp flux was simulated and denoted as fluxswe three additional swat model runs were then carried by adding the sources of af idw and afrh one after another and the respective simulated fluxes are denoted as fluxswe af fluxswe af idw and fluxswe af idw afrh the instream tp flux contributed by an additional source can be calculated as the difference between two consecutive runs for example tp flux contributed by af could be calculated as fluxswe af fluxswe sections 3 4 and 3 5 aim to investigate the potential changes in the transborder tp flux under different dam construction scenarios as well as its potential changes to the downstream region lower region of lmrb to excavate the dams impact the water discharge process hydraulic residence time and tp balance of each reservoir were calculated under each experiment and then the tp retention was calculated compared to the bs scenario for example the simulated instream tp flux out of the lrb under bs experiment and dcs 7 i experiment are denoted as tpbs and tpdcs 7 i respectively the percentage of tp retention by dams under dcs 7 i experiment could be calculated as tpbs tpdcs 7 i tpbs in section 3 5 the tp flux at the outlet of the lrb in each experiment was divided by the total tp loads in the lower lmrb obtained from previous literature which is defined as the delivered ratio to the lower lmrb the magnitude of the ratio and its changes under different experiments are discussed to expound the influence of chinese dams on the phosphorus flux in the downstream region it is worth noting that swat model only provides the tp loading pattern under the scenarios without dams because it does not have full functioning reservoir modules for the scenarios within dams three operation rules scheme i iii were implemented in the reservoir operation model to obtain the process of discharge from a reservoir after that the derived data from swat model and the discharge data from reservoir operation model were used simultaneously to drive the mass balance model and to obtain the tp retention by dams more information on this procedure are introduced in text s2 in the supplemental materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of calibration and validation figs 2 and 3 illustrate the calibration and validation results for streamflow and sediment respectively with the values of nse and r2 coefficient of determination indicated according to the model performance standards suggested by moriasi et al 2007 the model demonstrates a good performance for the two target variables for tp the relevant parameters were manually tuned at the monthly time resolution using the limited number of observations at the gongguoqiao reservoir site fig 4 shows that the average level and seasonal variation of tp concentration at the site are adequately captured by the model nse 0 77 r2 0 88 and pbias 2 94 and the calibrated model could be credible to a certain extent for simulation compared to some previous studies yoshimura et al 2009 oeurng et al 2016 trang et al 2017 3 2 spatiotemporal characteristics of tp loading fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of annual average loadof tp among 381 sub basins and the average tp concentration in the river reaches under the no reservoir condition during the entire simulation period the average annual loads of tp ranges from 0 08 to 8 91 kg ha fig 5a shows that high tp loads sub basins in red occur at the midstream and downstream regions where intensive agriculture and urban areas present the other regions are mostly covered by forest and grass without significant human intervention see fig 1b most upstream areas have average annual tp loads below 1 09 kg ha the whole basin annual tp loads are 27 079 tons year while the annual tp export out of the lrb is 14 112 tons year under the no dams scenario demonstrating considerable tp retention in the stream channels fig 5b shows that most upstream reaches have low tp concentrations and the tp concentration increases along the main channel from 0 047 to 0 380 mg l it is also worth noting that most of the tributaries especially in the midstream and downstream of the basin have very high concentrations of tp that range from 0 335 to 2 778 mg l these high concentrations reflect the high tp loads from land covers such as farmlands and rural residential areas commonly near tributaries of the midstream and downstream regions and the lower streamflow in tributaries fig 6 shows the time series of the annual tp and streamflow at the outlet of the lrb the tp transported out of lrb under no dams scenario ranges from 8 433 to 20 990 t year with an average of 14 112 t year according to fig 6 the variability in tp loads is mainly due to the hydrological conditions a simple regression analysis shows that the streamflow explains approximately 83 of the variability in tp loads fig 7 further illustrates the intra annual variation in tp concentration at four different locations shown in fig s1 of the supplemental materials along the mainstream the outlet of tibet province about 1156 km downstream of the river source the xw reservoir site the nzd reservoir site and the outlet of the lrb under the no reservoir condition during the entire simulation period the basin area upstream of the first site is mostly covered by barren land and grassland which has a low socio economic and rainfall intensity condition as well as low human activities density the second and third sites represent the critical positions with two large reservoirs and lots of human activities nearby the fourth site s instream tp flux means the transborder delivery to the lower lancang mekong region in fig 7 chinese surface water quality standards for tp concentration gb3838 2002 are also plotted i e category iii 0 2 mg l category iv 0 2 0 3 mg l and category v 0 3 0 4 mg l surface waters meet the standards of categories iii iv and v are appropriate for domestic drinking water industrial consumption and agricultural irrigation respectively as fig 7 shows tp concentration significantly correlates with streamflow at all sites except that the tp concentration in june of fig 7 a is much lower than other months with similar streamflow this phenomenon is due to the spatial and temporal disparities in rainfall in this basin as the catchment upstream of this site has a large range of latitude more details about it could be found in the text s4 in the supplemental materials the tp concentrations from july to september fail to meet the category iv standard especially for the nuozhadu reservoir site in other months tp concentrations generally meet the category iii standard the significant increase in tp concentration during may at the xiaowan and nouzhadu reservoir sites may be attributed to fertilizer applications in april and may in surrounding farmlands which are prevalent near these sites the average tp concentrations at the four locations are 0 129 mg l 0 142 mg l 0 188 mg l and 0 175 mg l respectively demonstrating an increasing tendency from upstream to downstream except the last location the increasing tendency is probably due to the increasing human activities therefore anthropogenic tp sources and increasing rainfall intensity therefore increasing soil erodibility from upstream to downstream the decreased tp concentration from fig 7c to d is probably due to the very limited human activities near the china laos myanmar border in general tp concentration has increased during the flood season along with the increasing streamflow which leads to the preponderant instream tp flux during flood season accounting for about 85 of the instream tp flux at the outlet of lrb 3 3 source attribution of tp fig 8 a shows the magnitude and source composition of the incremental tp loads at ten locations along the mainstream while four of them are same with typical locations in fig 7 the additional locations are all the completed dams sites except that the first one is the boundary between upstream and midstream shown in fig s1 of the supplemental materials overall swe is the dominant tp source in this basin at the 1451 km location the leading reservoir site the tp flux contributed by swe account for more than 90 of total tp flux along the river the contribution by anthropogenic sources starts to increase due to the enhanced human activities in the midstream and downstream and reaches its maximum value at a downstream distance of approximately 1786 km at the outlet of the lancang river basin swe af idw and afrh account for 82 4 4 and 10 of the annual total tp flux respectively fig 8b shows the magnitude and source composition of the incremental tp loads at different locations for example the instream tp flux at the 592 km and 1156 km locations are denoted as flux592 and flux1156 respectively and the drainage area for these two locations are denoted as a592 and a1156 respectively thus the incremental tp loads in kg year ha at the 1156 km location can be calculated as flux1156 flux592 a1156 a592 which reflects the source magnitude in the drainage area of the river segment between 592 km and 1156 km locations it is evident that source loading of tp is much higher near xw and nzd than other parts of the river basin which is consistent with the results in fig 5a also the contribution of anthropogenic sources is most significant in the drainage area between xw and nzd has much high overall fig 8 shows that the instream tp flux transported out of the lrb is mainly from the natural source which demonstrates that there are no obvious human activities in the lrb increasing the tp concentration level of the river how the dam construction and reservoir operation would impact the tp export from the lrb as well as the implications of the impact to the lower lancang mekong river basin will be addressed in the following two sections 3 4 impacts of the dams on the tp export the dams only alter the instream tp transport and therefore the tp loads from the drainage areas are kept the same as the baseline experiment i e no reservoirs which is 27 079 tons per year on average the phosphorus that could be transported to the outlet of lrb was focused in this section as described in section 3 2 about 14 112 tons of phosphorus transport to the outlet of lrb per year in the baseline experiment table 6 illustrates the information about the annual average instream tp flux out of lrb on average of 2000 monte carlo simulation samples σ ranges from 0 5 to 10 y 1 in each experiment considering different dam construction and operation schemes compared to the baseline experiment i e no dams 50 to 59 of the instream tp flux out of lrb would be trapped in the cascade reservoirs on average fig 9 illustrates the tp retention by dams in different numerical experiments the numbers above the box plots of fig 9 represent the sample means the box whisker plots reflect the uncertainty in σ which is significant in both wet and dry seasons it indicates that further studies are necessary to reduce uncertainty regardless of the uncertainty fig 9 shows that in general there would be only a small increase in tp retention as the number of reservoirs increases from 7 to 21 the main reason is three fold the spatial pattern of the tp load discussed in section 3 2 the locations of the additional reservoirs and reservoir characteristics firstly most of the additional reservoirs in the dcs 12 and dcs 21 are located at the upstream of the river basin where the tp loads are very low see figs 5 and 8 secondly all the additional reservoirs still under construction locate upstream of the lancang river basin while the completed reservoirs locate downstream of the basin even though the upstream dams were not built the reservoirs close to the outlet of basin may trap the nutrients according to the location thirdly all the additional reservoirs in dcs 12 and dcs 21 have short hydraulic residence time 0 11 year while the hydraulic residence time of existing reservoirs xw and nzd are 0 48 year and 0 50 year respectively in the mass balance model less hydraulic residence time would prevent significant phosphorus settling therefore it is implied that the reservoirs that are under construction and are waiting for construction permissions would not significantly deteriorate the retention of tp there are some similar conclusions in previous studies about the sediment interception in this region and the interception law of phosphorus is very similar to that of sediment schmitt et al 2019 has drawn a conclusion that the potential chinese hydropower dams in the lancang mekong river basin have little effect on sediment flux downstream due to their sites in addition a similar conclusion about the sediment connectivity in the se kong se san and sre pok 3s tributaries of the lower mekong has been found by schmitt et al 2018 as fig 9 indicates the annual retention rate is primarily determined by flood seasons because tp export in flood season accounts for about 85 of the annual tp export under no dam experiment as described in section 3 2 on an annual basis the tp retention rates in the three operation schemes have small difference fig 9a and the retention rate in scheme i is slightly higher than those in schemes ii and iii however the difference is not significant except the dry season fig 9c which can be explained by the hydraulic residence time fig 10 fig 10 shows the seasonal variations in hydraulic residence time of the only two dominant reservoirs xw and nzd in the three operation schemes it appears that the three schemes lead to similar residence times during the wet season but scheme i result in much higher residence time during the dry season as explained before a higher residence time would cause a higher retention rate when other factors keep the same an important implication is that in the lrb when the reservoir operation is optimized for power production both the total power generation and generation guaranteed ratio the tp retention would become smaller than scheme i operating the reservoirs at the normal water levers scheme ii considering the total power generation objective seems to trap less tp than scheme iii however the difference between scheme ii and scheme iii is not significant it is worth noting that under the operation schemes ii and iii the retention rate in the dry season is significantly lower than that in the wet season and that under scheme i and even become negative in the dry season fig 9c the tp retention rate depends on the hydraulic residence time as well as the parameter σ that describes tp loss from water column as described in section 2 3 for the hydropower reservoirs they usually store some water in flood season for the prospective use in the dry season which would also trap a part of phosphorus flux at the same time the operation scheme ii and scheme iii represent operation modes of hydropower station which lead to much smaller hydraulic residence time in dry season than scheme i fig 10 considering the uncertainty explained in section 2 3 if the parameter σ is not big enough to make the trapped tp settle the trapped tp would be released in the dry season and thus leads to a negative value of retention rate wu and liu 2012 have made the similar explanation on the negative value of nutrient retention rate in their work 3 5 relevance to the downstream region it is of great concern about the dams in lrb would significantly impact the nutrients balance in the lower lancang mekong river basin the lower lmrb means the part outside china in this paper trang et al trang et al 2017 estimated a cumulative annual tp load of 360 336 tons year from sekong srepok and sesan basins 3s basin a sub basin in the lower mekong river basin with a drainage area of 78 529 km2 about 10 of the total area of entire lancang mekong river basin however yoshimura et al yoshimura et al 2009 s estimate is an order of magnitude lower which is 363 000 tons year for the entire lancang mekong river basin 795 500 km2 the annual export of tp at the estuary is estimated to be 900 tons year yoshimura et al 2009 indicating that 97 of the tp load is dissipated within the basin through various processes while these two previous studies have remarkably different estimates they both imply a limited contribution of the lrb to the tp balance in the lower lmrb for example if the more conservative estimate yoshimura et al 2009 is compared against the tp load i e 27 079 tons year in bs experiment occurred in the lrb only accounts for 7 5 of the total load of the entire lmrb i e 27 079 out of 363 000 tons year the delivered ratio of the tp flux at the outlet of the lrb i e 14 112 tons year in bs scenario over the total tp loads in the lower lmrb i e 363 000 minus 27 079 tons year is only 4 2 because the retention rate by the dams ranges from 50 to 59 see table 6 the overall change in the delivered ratio tp flux out of lrb divided by the tp loading in the lower lmrb that would be induced by the development of cascade reservoirs in china can be estimated as from 4 2 to 1 7 2 1 which are both really small for the mekong river basin as described above lrb accounts for about 20 of the area and 16 of the runoff of the entire lancang mekong river basin while it accounts for only 7 5 of the tp loads rare human activities seem to be the primary reason based on the land use map about 84 of the lrb area is covered by natural vegetation forest and grassland and only less than 9 is covered by farmland for the lower lmrb the farmland accounts for about 33 3 of the total area and this will continuously increase based on the changes in population gdp and the current land use yoshimura et al 2009 in the 3s basin the farmland accounts for about 13 2 trang et al 2017 and about 11 6 oeurng et al 2016 of the area according to two studies the lower lmrb supports more than 60 million people s life about 1 3 for the total population in thailand laos cambodia and vietnam and it is important for ensuring the food security based on its fertile land and water resources mrc 2005 besides the mekong delta is an asian center of rice production producing half the rice for vietnam fao 2002 according to kondolf et al 2018 there are more than 40 population centers along the major rivers in the lower lmrb while there are only 3 population centers in the lrb hence there may be more waste water discharge in the lower mekong river basin due to the urban development and population increase mrc 2005 mrc 2007 in contrast there are much fewer human activities such as fertilization use industrial wastewater discharge in the lrb due to the cold weather conditions in qinghai and tibet province steep terrain mountainous are much more than plains which leads to the limited contribution rate of tp to sum up for the concern about potential eutrophic status in the lower lancang mekong river li and bush 2015 oeurng et al 2016 trang et al 2017 yoshimura et al 2009 the lrb accounts for only 7 5 of the tp loads of the entire lancang mekong river basin and has smaller rising tendency in the farm land area compared to the lower lmrb for the concern about the tp interception and the decline of ecological function fang et al 2015 kuenzer et al 2013 wei et al 2009 wild et al 2016 the chinese dams in lrb really have significant impacts on the tp retention in the chinese part of lancang mekong river basin which has possibilities to impact instream tp flux in a certain distance downstream of the lancang mekong border as for the entire mekong river the impact on the phosphorus balance is little delivered ratio changes from 4 2 to 1 7 2 1 according to the modeling results especially for the estuarine delta which need future demonstration based on the continuous water quality observation after more dams completed more comprehensive analysis about the dams influence on the aquatic ecosystem of the lower mekong river basin need to be carried out combined with other nutrients such as nitrogen 4 conclusions total phosphorus tp is an essential indicator for instream ecological systems especially for transborder rivers supporting fisheries knowledge of spatial temporal patterns of tp load and the transborder flux of tp is essential for river basin management in this study the swat model was applied to map tp loads in the upper lancang mekong river basin in china i e the lancang river basin lrb the model was calibrated against three hydrological stations and one water quality station within the basin and the calibration results were demonstrated to be reasonable for exploring the transborder impact on the tp transport by the human activities in the lrb the process based swat model was further used for obtaining the tp loads changes under a series of dam construction scenarios in the future key findings of this study are as follow 1 annual tp loads from the land areas to water bodies is 27 079 tons on average of which 14 112 tons are transported to the basin outlet under the no dam scenario the tp loads in the midstream and downstream locations are much larger than that in the upstream location and the catchment areas of the tributaries have a larger tp loads coefficient 0 15 8 19 kg ha 1 y 1 than that of the main channel 0 08 2 50 kg ha 1 y 1 see fig 5a due to the spatial distribution of human activities the annual tp loads follow the tendency of surface runoff at four typical comparison points of the basin tp loads have the most significant value from july to october contributing 85 of tp loads throughout the year tp loads from the soil weathering and erosion swe were largest followed by animal feedlot and rural household afrh agricultural planting and fertilization af and industrial and domestic wastewater idw with tp contributions of 82 10 4 and 4 for the whole year respectively 2 the dams 9 experiments will decrease 50 59 of the tp export at the outlet of lrb on average of 2000 monte carlo simulation samples σ ranges from 0 5 to 10 y 1 compared to the no dam scenario the parameter σ in the mass balance model has a huge impact on the instream tp flux which indicates the importance of having better estimates of σ in future studies the reservoirs that are under construction and are waiting for construction permissions would not significantly deteriorate the retention of tp due to the reservoir sizes and locating sites tp retention efficiency during flood season is similar to the annual mean and larger than that in the dry season the impact of different operation schemes on the tp exports is not obvious due to the reservoir regulating abilities and the reservoir operation objectives for the concern about the transborder tp delivery the tp flux from lrb to the lower lmrb only accounts for about 4 2 of the total tp loads in the mekong river basin under no dam scenario according to the modeling results and previous studies considering the dams influence on the tp balance in lower mekong river this ratio would decrease 2 1 2 5 under different dam construction scenarios the dam construction in the lrb has a small impact in the lower lmrb with regard the loading of tp and the impact may be limited within a small distance below the outlet of the lancang river the dam construction might have a more significant impact in the lower lmrb with regard to other nutrients such as nitrogen further studies are needed the results of this study would be useful for understanding the potential trans border impact of dam construction on the phosphorus balance in such disputed area i e lancang mekong river basin this study also supplies a tp loading map in lrb which could help to further investigate water quality ecological impact proper management strategies of this region the tp loading map could also supply to study the energy water food nexus problem in this complex region with comprehensive demand such as hydropower water quality protection

5131,nutrients are critical to the development of plant and animal life in the river ecological system in recent years more attentions have arisen on the impact of building hydropower dams to transborder nutrient flux in the lancang mekong river basin lmrb in this paper phosphorus was taken as an example which is considered as one of the most significant factors to limit biological activities in the river the soil and water assessment tool swat was used to access the multisource loading pattern of total phosphorus tp under no dam scenario and various types of dam construction scenarios analyses were performed to investigate potential changes in the transborder tp flux from lancang river basin lrb chinese part of lmrb to lower lmrb other parts of lmrb the results showed that the total phosphorus load in the lrb is about 27 079 tons year of which 85 tp is collected from july to october the annual tp export at the outlet of the lrb is 14 112 tons year under no dam scenario which accounts for about 4 2 of the total tp loads in the lower lmrb with seven to twenty one dams included in experiments tp flux at the outlet of the lrb decreased 50 59 while the delivered ratio for the lower lmrb decreased 2 1 2 5 as a summary building dams has a significant impact on the tp transport pattern in the chinese part of lmrb but very limited effect in lower lmrb according to the modeling results especially for the mekong delta moreover the existing dams seven dams seem to intercept much more phosphorus than those dams that are under construction keywords lancang mekong river phosphorus influence of dam construction nutrient retention swat model 1 introduction the lancang mekong river is the largest transborder river in asia which originates from the southwest region of china and runs through myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam the upstream part of the river within the border of china is referred to as the lancang river basin lrb the lancang mekong river basin lmrb maintains incredible biodiversity with approximately 1200 to 1700 fish species dudgeon 2000 2002 mrc 2007 and provides over 50 of the protein demanded by the 60 million people living in this basin mainly in the lower basin cochrane et al 2014 keskinen et al 2015 mrc 2015 the river acts as a home for rare and threatened wildlife species that depend on its streamflow such as the irrawaddy dolphin siamese crocodile and giant catfish mrc 2005 therefore it is essential to avoid devastating changes in the flow regime and preserve water quality under the stresses of population growth economic development deforestation and dam construction nutrients are essential inputs for riverine ecosystems but high levels of nutrients may lead to nutrient enrichment changes in algal and fish ecology deterioration of drinking water and other consequences wang et al 2019 conley et al 2009 somura et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 on the other hand nutrient starvation can impede environmental development of ecosystems due to the limitation for biological growth guildford et al 2007 nixon 2003 rattan 2017 von schiller et al 2016 phosphorus nitrogen carbon and silicon are common nutrients that support aquatic habitats among them phosphorus has a critical role in genetic systems and in the storage and transfer of cell energy which are essential to all lives elser et al 2007 maavara et al 2015 however phosphorus is usually in short supply in natural relative to other macronutrients and has been demonstrated to be a limiting nutrient for many ecological systems brett and benjamin 2007 chapra 1997 maavara et al 2015 for the lancang mekong river recent studies have also found that phytoplankton growth and biological activities are broadly limited by the amount of phosphorus burnett et al 2017 fan et al 2015 li and bush 2015 wu et al 2014 transborder delivery of riverine nutrients has been a critical water issue in many parts of the world such as the sava river across slovenia croatia bosnia herzegovina serbia levi et al 2018 the vilija river across belarus and lithuania čerkasova et al 2018 the nisa river across germany poland and czech republic kaendler et al 2017 and the tigris river across turkey and iraq varol 2013 for the lancang mekong river debates have existed long regards to the impact of human activities on the transport of nutrients some studies reported increased levels of nutrients due to population growth agricultural development urbanization and climate change which may result in an eutrophic status in the lower region of the lmrb trang et al 2017 oeurng et al 2016 yoshimura et al 2009 some other studies were concerned about dam construction especially for those large chinese dams in lrb a worry exists that the interception of nutrients by the cascade dams of lrb may impair the ecological function of the lower mekong delta fang et al 2015 kuenzer et al 2013 wei et al 2009 wild et al 2016 the studies mentioned above showed contradicted viewpoints one concerns about excessive nutrients while the other put emphasis on nutrients starvation to address the above mentioned contradicted problems one key question to answer is whether the transborder nutrients flux from the lrb accounts for a significant portion of the total nutrients loading of the entire basin and to what extent the cascade dams would change the contribution however this question remains to be unaddressed taking phosphorous for an example some studies estimated the total phosphorus tp loading of the entire lrmb yoshimura et al 2009 or the loading of certain sub basins in the lower lmrb oeurng et al 2016 trang et al 2017 however few studies have performed a detailed calculation on the tp loading in the lrb and there has been no quantitative analysis of the dams impact on the tp loading this study assessed the transborder flux of total phosphorus tp from the lrb chinese part of lmrb to the lower region of lmrb other parts of lmrb and investigated the impacts of dam construction a process based watershed model swat was developed to estimate the tp loads in lrb various data were collected to implement the model including the land use data soil map meteorological data digital elevation model dem socio economic data relative to point and non point sources discharge sediment and water quality data observed streamflow the primary study objectives are 1 to achieve a holistic understanding of the transborder phosphorous transport in the lrb using model data fusion 2 to investigate the potential changes in the transborder tp flux under different scenarios of dam construction and 3 to examine the relevance of the transborder tp flux as well as its potential changes to the downstream region lower region of lmrb the results of the study can provide vital information to avoid misunderstandings and mitigate disputes about the impacts of the cascade reservoirs in china and to generate insights into the management of water energy and ecosystems in the lancang mekong river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region the lancang river lies upstream of the lancang mekong river fig 1 a and its mainstream is 2161 km long the lancang river basin lrb has an area of approximately 156 978 km2 which contributes to about 20 of the area and 16 of the runoff of the entire lancang mekong river basin lmrb the lrb spans latitudes from n33 to n21 and altitudes from 5500 m to 2500 m with various climate characteristics across the basin the precipitation and temperature increase from the north to south and show various annual distribution patterns in different catchments the upstream region from the river source to changdu city has a temperate plateau climate with an average temperature of 10 c and annual precipitation of 400 800 mm the midstream of the river from changdu city to the gongguoqiao reservoir has a sub tropical climate with an average temperature of 12 15 c and an annual rainfall of 1000 2500 mm the boundaries between upstream midstream and downstream are shown in fig s1 of the supplemental materials the downstream region has a tropical climate with an average temperature of 15 22 c and annual precipitation of 1000 3000 mm in the lancang mekong river basin the wet season occurs from june to october which accounts for more than 80 of the annual rainfall the dry season occurs from november to may the major land use types of the river basin are grassland and forest fig 1c which account for 43 0 and 41 2 of the total basin area respectively cultivated lands of corn rice potato and wheat account for 7 0 1 4 0 3 and 0 1 of the total area respectively barren land water areas wetlands rural residential areas and urban land accounts for the left 7 of the total area according to fig 1b most grassland is in the north while most forest is in the south farmland is concentrated in the lower middle part of the basin where human activities are intense mainly including industrial wastewater streamflow and animal feedlots there are twenty one reservoirs along the main channel of the lancang river and seven of them see fig 1a were completed before 2018 fan et al 2015 wang et al 2017 two reservoirs with annual regulation capacities xiaowan xw and nuozhadu nzd reservoirs are the most important ones due to large storage the water quality of the mainstream lancang river is often rated as grade ii or iii e g grades i ii and iii are suitable for drinking because fewer pollution sources are associated with the less developed regional economy in the basin fan et al 2015 the tp concentration is very low from october to may in most reaches of the mainstream but sometimes increased from may to august near the xiaowan reservoir wu et al 2014 wei et al 2009 2 2 the swat model and data swat soil water assessment tool is semi distributed dynamic and physically based tool that can be used to perform long term continuous simulation of watershed hydrology and water quality arnold et al 1998 swat has been widely used to model the impact of land management practices on water movement sediment movement crop growth and nutrient cycling in large complex watersheds wu and chen 2013 gassman et al 2014 srinivasan et al 1998 trang et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 in this study a swat model was developed to assess the multisource loads of total phosphorus tp in the lrb in the model lrb is delineated into 381 sub basins which include in total 2436 hydrological response units hrus we divide the time scale into the warmup period from the year 1978 to the year 1979 and model simulation period from the year 1980 to the year 2014 surface runoff and sediments play essential roles in phosphorus transport most phosphorus is adsorbed by sediment and erosion of soil particles that remove phosphorus from fields brett and benjamin 2007 liu et al 2015 molina navarro et al 2018 neitsch et al 2009 thus the swat model in this study simulates both streamflow and riverine sediment loading besides the instream tp concentration table 1 summarizes the data used for the model development to set up the swat model the original land use and land cover lulc data was reclassified into several swat categories the soil map was taken from the soil databases that was produced by the nanjing institute of soil science the properties of each soil type were determined based on the chinese soil database shi et al 2010 yu et al 2007 except that the available water capacity sol awc saturated hydraulic conductivity sol k and moist bulk density sol bd of soils were estimated using the soil plant atmosphere water spaw software jiang et al 2014 wei et al 2007 daily meteorological data during the time period from the year1978 to the year 2014 was collected from 33 weather stations information of crop management practices including the timing of planting fertilizer application and harvest was obtained via field surveys with farmers in the study region and was used to prepare the management files of the swat model industrial and domestic wastewaters referred to as idw are lumped into one source and the monthly volumes and tp concentrations of the wastewater were collected from the statistical yearbooks of the three provinces covered by the basin pollutant loads from animal feedlot and rural household referred to as afrh are also grouped into one category the export coefficient method which has been widely used in large scale studies bowes et al 2008 is adopted to estimate the tp load from afrh the tp loads from both idw and afrh were estimated for each of the 43 counties in total within the basin and then each county was conceptualized as a point source discharging to the river system as these counties are among the least developed areas in china the change in socio economic conditions in lrb had not been significant from the year 2009 to the year 2014 thus it is appropriate to use the load estimates of the year 2014 as the model inputs for the calibration period from the year 2009 to the year 2012 of tp according to the available observed data the swat model output files were calculated monthly for the model calibration and validation monthly flow measurements from the year 1980 to the year 2008 and sediment load measurements from the year 1980 to the year 1986 were obtained at three hydrological stations jiuzhou jiajiu and yunjinghong as indicated in fig 1a along the mainstream manwan reservoir mw was the only reservoir that was built up in the year 1993 within the observation period from the year 1980 to the year 2008 to eliminate the impact of mw on the flow regime after the year 1993 back calculation from the actual flow measurements to the natural flow conditions was performed based on the historical information of mw s operation during 1993 to 2008 see details in supporting information text s1 observations of tp concentration are very scarce since we only collected nine monthly observations in the period of the year 2009 to the year 2012 at the entrance of the gongguoqiao reservoir ggq before 2012 ggq was the leading reservoir of the cascade reservoir system thus the tp concentration measured at this location would not be impacted by the cascade reservoirs eventually the swat model was calibrated and validated for streamflow sediment and tp under the no reservoir condition and the information is presented in table 2 for the streamflow the calibration period is from the year 1980 to the year 2002 while the validation period is from the year 2003 to the year 2008 except that the validation period at yunjinghong station is from the year 2003 to the year 2006 due to the lack of the data from the year 2007 to the year 2008 for the sediment loads the calibration period is from the year 1980 to the year 1984 while the validation period is from the year 1985 to the year 1986 for tp only calibration was performed due to the scarcity of observed data the swat model was calibrated for streamflow sediment and tp consequently eleven and five sensitive parameters were considered in the calibrations of streamflow and sediment respectively according to a test of sensitivity and previous research experience abbaspour et al 2007 li et al 2010 zheng and han 2016 oeurng et al 2016 yang et al 2016 kalcic et al 2016 their initial ranges and calibrated values are listed in table 3 it should be noted that a distributed parameter pattern was adopted in the calibration of streamflow and sediment some parameters e g alpha bf have different values for different sub basins which were calibrated according to three hydrologic stations meanwhile some other parameters e g usle c and sol awc have different values according to different land covers soil types or soil layers as shown via the superscripts a and b in table 3 the calibration of streamflow and sediment was performed using an automated calibration tool soil and water assessment tool calibration and uncertainty procedure swat cup designed for swat abbaspour 2011 for each calibration task three iterations of swat cup were applied and each iteration ran 400 swat simulations to identify an optimal parameter set as well as to achieve updated parameter ranges narrower than the initial ones parameter ranges resulted from the previous iteration are then considered as the initial ranges for the subsequent iteration four sensitive parameters for the simulation of tp were selected after a test of sensitivity for the lrb table 3 the selected parameters were manually tuned due to the observational data of tp concentration is too scarce to perform an automated calibration in the adjustment process the match between the order of magnitude of the simulated and the observed values was preferred and then the variation trend of total phosphorus was focused it was found that erorgp has the greatest influence on the order of magnitude of the simulated total phosphorus the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient is used as the objective function to evaluate the model performance a value of 1 0 represents a perfect fit of the model for the swat simulation while the values of 0 5 0 65 and 0 75 can be considered as satisfactory good or very good fit of the model respectively moriasi et al 2007 2 3 mass balance of tp in the cascade reservoirs a phosphorus mass balance model was used to calculate the tp retention in the reservoirs brett and benjamin 2007 maavara et al 2015 vollenweider 1975 the mass balance of tp is formulated as 1 d m d t l σ m q v m where m kg is the total mass of tp in the reservoir t is time step 0 01 month in this study l kg year 1 is inflow flux of tp to the reservoir v m3 is the storage volume of the reservoir q m3 year 1 is the outflow flux from the reservoir and σ year 1 is a first order rate constant describing tp loss from water column which is related to the relative thickness of the photic zone and the average particle settling velocity the parameter σ was suggested as 0 801 y 1 by maavara et al 2015 according to regression analysis but this value contains high uncertainty an uncertainty analysis is therefore necessary to make the model results meaningful zheng and keller 2007 this study considers a range of 0 5 10 y 1 for σ which well reflects the significant uncertainty of this parameter indicated by previous studies brett and benjamin 2007 chapra 1997 labaugh 1985 maavara et al 2015 the tp mass balance model was performed with runge kutta 4 integration and 0 01 month time step maavara et al 2015 monte carlo simulations with 2000 samples were performed to calculate the annual tp retention from the year 1980 to the year 2014 in each different experiment the monte carlo simulations assumed a uniform distribution of σ within the pre defined range and all the reservoirs were sampled independently the range of 2000 experimental samples and corresponding statistical values were given in the result section each reservoir except the leading reservoir in a cascade reservoirs system receives tp loads from both its drainage area and its upstream reservoir in this study the watershed tp loads were simulated using swat model and the upstream tp loads were calculated using the mass balance model 2 4 scenarios of dam construction and operation this study investigates how the ongoing dam constructions in lrb would impact lrb s tp export to the lower lancang mekong river basin based on swat simulations table 4 provides information of the twenty one dams planned along the mainstream the storage capacities of the reservoirs awaiting construction are still undetermined and thus they are estimated according to the designed installed capacities as well as the existing reservoirs with similar installed capacities for example huangdeng reservoir has a designed installed capacity of 190 104 kw and a designed storage of 14 2 108 m3 while tuoba reservoir has a designed installed capacity of 140 104 kw then the storage of tuoba reservoir awaiting construction was estimated to be 10 4 108 m3 the flood control level is the limited water level for preventing flood risks during a flood season from july to october in this basin which is normally lower than or equal to the normal water level the swat model provides the values of mean annual streamflow and results are illustrated in table 4 seven dams miaowei gongguoqiao xiaowan manwan dachaoshan nuozhadu and jinghong shown in fig 1 a as green triangles have been built before year 2018 and five of them wunonglong lidi huangdeng dahuaqiao and ganlanba dams shown in fig 1 a as brown triangles are still under construction the rest of the dams such as cege yuelong kagong banda rumei guxue gushui tuoba and mensong dams shown in fig 1 a as black triangles are still waiting for the construction permission due to social economic and environmental concerns to better understand the impact of reservoirs on the tp flux ten numerical experiments were conducted using different combinations of dam construction scenario and reservoir operation scheme see table 5 four dam construction scenarios were evaluated 1 the baseline scenario with no dams representing the nature condition 2 the scenario with the seven completed dams representing the current situation 3 the scenario with the seven completed dams and five dams that are under construction representing the recent planning situation 4 and the scenario with all twenty one dams representing the forward planning situation which are denoted as bs dcs 7 dcs 12 dcs 21 respectively in each dam construction scenario except the baseline scenario three operation schemes were hypothesized since most of the dams have not been completed and no real operational data are available in scheme i all the reservoirs keep their normal storage levels during non flood seasons and their flood control levels during the flood season respectively in order to keep high water heads for power generating schemes ii and iii are both obtained from a previous study chen et al 2014 in scheme ii xw and nzd the only two reservoirs with annual regulating capacity are operated as a function of the designed target storage of each month while other reservoirs are operated as in scheme i due to their small storage capacities and low level abilities in regulating the streamflow the target storages of xw and nzd are designed aiming at maximizing the total power generation in cascade reservoirs which are presented as the reservoir operation chart the detailed description about the reservoir operation chart and the reservoir optimal operation model was given by chen et al 2014 scheme iii is similar to scheme ii except that the reservoir operation chart is designed for maximizing the generation guaranteed ratio the reliability of power generation take the completed dam construction scenario as an example the experiment ids under three operation schemes are denoted as dcs 7 i dcs 7 ii dcs 7 iii respectively 2 5 the simulation procedure and analytical methods the swat model was first calibrated and validated under the bs scenario without dams according to the collected data the results are shown in section 3 1 in sections 3 2 and 3 3 a holistic map of the phosphorus loading and the source attribution of phosphorus in the lrb to demonstrate the bs scenario which aims to reveal the phosphorus transport pattern in the lancang river without dams there are four primary sources of tp in the study area soil weathering and erosion swe agricultural fertilization af idw and afrh multiple runs of the swat model with different scenarios of pollution source inputs were conducted to isolate and estimate the amount of tp load from each source the swat model was first run without any pollution sources except that the soil weathering and erosion process is modeled in this case the instreams tp flux was simulated and denoted as fluxswe three additional swat model runs were then carried by adding the sources of af idw and afrh one after another and the respective simulated fluxes are denoted as fluxswe af fluxswe af idw and fluxswe af idw afrh the instream tp flux contributed by an additional source can be calculated as the difference between two consecutive runs for example tp flux contributed by af could be calculated as fluxswe af fluxswe sections 3 4 and 3 5 aim to investigate the potential changes in the transborder tp flux under different dam construction scenarios as well as its potential changes to the downstream region lower region of lmrb to excavate the dams impact the water discharge process hydraulic residence time and tp balance of each reservoir were calculated under each experiment and then the tp retention was calculated compared to the bs scenario for example the simulated instream tp flux out of the lrb under bs experiment and dcs 7 i experiment are denoted as tpbs and tpdcs 7 i respectively the percentage of tp retention by dams under dcs 7 i experiment could be calculated as tpbs tpdcs 7 i tpbs in section 3 5 the tp flux at the outlet of the lrb in each experiment was divided by the total tp loads in the lower lmrb obtained from previous literature which is defined as the delivered ratio to the lower lmrb the magnitude of the ratio and its changes under different experiments are discussed to expound the influence of chinese dams on the phosphorus flux in the downstream region it is worth noting that swat model only provides the tp loading pattern under the scenarios without dams because it does not have full functioning reservoir modules for the scenarios within dams three operation rules scheme i iii were implemented in the reservoir operation model to obtain the process of discharge from a reservoir after that the derived data from swat model and the discharge data from reservoir operation model were used simultaneously to drive the mass balance model and to obtain the tp retention by dams more information on this procedure are introduced in text s2 in the supplemental materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of calibration and validation figs 2 and 3 illustrate the calibration and validation results for streamflow and sediment respectively with the values of nse and r2 coefficient of determination indicated according to the model performance standards suggested by moriasi et al 2007 the model demonstrates a good performance for the two target variables for tp the relevant parameters were manually tuned at the monthly time resolution using the limited number of observations at the gongguoqiao reservoir site fig 4 shows that the average level and seasonal variation of tp concentration at the site are adequately captured by the model nse 0 77 r2 0 88 and pbias 2 94 and the calibrated model could be credible to a certain extent for simulation compared to some previous studies yoshimura et al 2009 oeurng et al 2016 trang et al 2017 3 2 spatiotemporal characteristics of tp loading fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of annual average loadof tp among 381 sub basins and the average tp concentration in the river reaches under the no reservoir condition during the entire simulation period the average annual loads of tp ranges from 0 08 to 8 91 kg ha fig 5a shows that high tp loads sub basins in red occur at the midstream and downstream regions where intensive agriculture and urban areas present the other regions are mostly covered by forest and grass without significant human intervention see fig 1b most upstream areas have average annual tp loads below 1 09 kg ha the whole basin annual tp loads are 27 079 tons year while the annual tp export out of the lrb is 14 112 tons year under the no dams scenario demonstrating considerable tp retention in the stream channels fig 5b shows that most upstream reaches have low tp concentrations and the tp concentration increases along the main channel from 0 047 to 0 380 mg l it is also worth noting that most of the tributaries especially in the midstream and downstream of the basin have very high concentrations of tp that range from 0 335 to 2 778 mg l these high concentrations reflect the high tp loads from land covers such as farmlands and rural residential areas commonly near tributaries of the midstream and downstream regions and the lower streamflow in tributaries fig 6 shows the time series of the annual tp and streamflow at the outlet of the lrb the tp transported out of lrb under no dams scenario ranges from 8 433 to 20 990 t year with an average of 14 112 t year according to fig 6 the variability in tp loads is mainly due to the hydrological conditions a simple regression analysis shows that the streamflow explains approximately 83 of the variability in tp loads fig 7 further illustrates the intra annual variation in tp concentration at four different locations shown in fig s1 of the supplemental materials along the mainstream the outlet of tibet province about 1156 km downstream of the river source the xw reservoir site the nzd reservoir site and the outlet of the lrb under the no reservoir condition during the entire simulation period the basin area upstream of the first site is mostly covered by barren land and grassland which has a low socio economic and rainfall intensity condition as well as low human activities density the second and third sites represent the critical positions with two large reservoirs and lots of human activities nearby the fourth site s instream tp flux means the transborder delivery to the lower lancang mekong region in fig 7 chinese surface water quality standards for tp concentration gb3838 2002 are also plotted i e category iii 0 2 mg l category iv 0 2 0 3 mg l and category v 0 3 0 4 mg l surface waters meet the standards of categories iii iv and v are appropriate for domestic drinking water industrial consumption and agricultural irrigation respectively as fig 7 shows tp concentration significantly correlates with streamflow at all sites except that the tp concentration in june of fig 7 a is much lower than other months with similar streamflow this phenomenon is due to the spatial and temporal disparities in rainfall in this basin as the catchment upstream of this site has a large range of latitude more details about it could be found in the text s4 in the supplemental materials the tp concentrations from july to september fail to meet the category iv standard especially for the nuozhadu reservoir site in other months tp concentrations generally meet the category iii standard the significant increase in tp concentration during may at the xiaowan and nouzhadu reservoir sites may be attributed to fertilizer applications in april and may in surrounding farmlands which are prevalent near these sites the average tp concentrations at the four locations are 0 129 mg l 0 142 mg l 0 188 mg l and 0 175 mg l respectively demonstrating an increasing tendency from upstream to downstream except the last location the increasing tendency is probably due to the increasing human activities therefore anthropogenic tp sources and increasing rainfall intensity therefore increasing soil erodibility from upstream to downstream the decreased tp concentration from fig 7c to d is probably due to the very limited human activities near the china laos myanmar border in general tp concentration has increased during the flood season along with the increasing streamflow which leads to the preponderant instream tp flux during flood season accounting for about 85 of the instream tp flux at the outlet of lrb 3 3 source attribution of tp fig 8 a shows the magnitude and source composition of the incremental tp loads at ten locations along the mainstream while four of them are same with typical locations in fig 7 the additional locations are all the completed dams sites except that the first one is the boundary between upstream and midstream shown in fig s1 of the supplemental materials overall swe is the dominant tp source in this basin at the 1451 km location the leading reservoir site the tp flux contributed by swe account for more than 90 of total tp flux along the river the contribution by anthropogenic sources starts to increase due to the enhanced human activities in the midstream and downstream and reaches its maximum value at a downstream distance of approximately 1786 km at the outlet of the lancang river basin swe af idw and afrh account for 82 4 4 and 10 of the annual total tp flux respectively fig 8b shows the magnitude and source composition of the incremental tp loads at different locations for example the instream tp flux at the 592 km and 1156 km locations are denoted as flux592 and flux1156 respectively and the drainage area for these two locations are denoted as a592 and a1156 respectively thus the incremental tp loads in kg year ha at the 1156 km location can be calculated as flux1156 flux592 a1156 a592 which reflects the source magnitude in the drainage area of the river segment between 592 km and 1156 km locations it is evident that source loading of tp is much higher near xw and nzd than other parts of the river basin which is consistent with the results in fig 5a also the contribution of anthropogenic sources is most significant in the drainage area between xw and nzd has much high overall fig 8 shows that the instream tp flux transported out of the lrb is mainly from the natural source which demonstrates that there are no obvious human activities in the lrb increasing the tp concentration level of the river how the dam construction and reservoir operation would impact the tp export from the lrb as well as the implications of the impact to the lower lancang mekong river basin will be addressed in the following two sections 3 4 impacts of the dams on the tp export the dams only alter the instream tp transport and therefore the tp loads from the drainage areas are kept the same as the baseline experiment i e no reservoirs which is 27 079 tons per year on average the phosphorus that could be transported to the outlet of lrb was focused in this section as described in section 3 2 about 14 112 tons of phosphorus transport to the outlet of lrb per year in the baseline experiment table 6 illustrates the information about the annual average instream tp flux out of lrb on average of 2000 monte carlo simulation samples σ ranges from 0 5 to 10 y 1 in each experiment considering different dam construction and operation schemes compared to the baseline experiment i e no dams 50 to 59 of the instream tp flux out of lrb would be trapped in the cascade reservoirs on average fig 9 illustrates the tp retention by dams in different numerical experiments the numbers above the box plots of fig 9 represent the sample means the box whisker plots reflect the uncertainty in σ which is significant in both wet and dry seasons it indicates that further studies are necessary to reduce uncertainty regardless of the uncertainty fig 9 shows that in general there would be only a small increase in tp retention as the number of reservoirs increases from 7 to 21 the main reason is three fold the spatial pattern of the tp load discussed in section 3 2 the locations of the additional reservoirs and reservoir characteristics firstly most of the additional reservoirs in the dcs 12 and dcs 21 are located at the upstream of the river basin where the tp loads are very low see figs 5 and 8 secondly all the additional reservoirs still under construction locate upstream of the lancang river basin while the completed reservoirs locate downstream of the basin even though the upstream dams were not built the reservoirs close to the outlet of basin may trap the nutrients according to the location thirdly all the additional reservoirs in dcs 12 and dcs 21 have short hydraulic residence time 0 11 year while the hydraulic residence time of existing reservoirs xw and nzd are 0 48 year and 0 50 year respectively in the mass balance model less hydraulic residence time would prevent significant phosphorus settling therefore it is implied that the reservoirs that are under construction and are waiting for construction permissions would not significantly deteriorate the retention of tp there are some similar conclusions in previous studies about the sediment interception in this region and the interception law of phosphorus is very similar to that of sediment schmitt et al 2019 has drawn a conclusion that the potential chinese hydropower dams in the lancang mekong river basin have little effect on sediment flux downstream due to their sites in addition a similar conclusion about the sediment connectivity in the se kong se san and sre pok 3s tributaries of the lower mekong has been found by schmitt et al 2018 as fig 9 indicates the annual retention rate is primarily determined by flood seasons because tp export in flood season accounts for about 85 of the annual tp export under no dam experiment as described in section 3 2 on an annual basis the tp retention rates in the three operation schemes have small difference fig 9a and the retention rate in scheme i is slightly higher than those in schemes ii and iii however the difference is not significant except the dry season fig 9c which can be explained by the hydraulic residence time fig 10 fig 10 shows the seasonal variations in hydraulic residence time of the only two dominant reservoirs xw and nzd in the three operation schemes it appears that the three schemes lead to similar residence times during the wet season but scheme i result in much higher residence time during the dry season as explained before a higher residence time would cause a higher retention rate when other factors keep the same an important implication is that in the lrb when the reservoir operation is optimized for power production both the total power generation and generation guaranteed ratio the tp retention would become smaller than scheme i operating the reservoirs at the normal water levers scheme ii considering the total power generation objective seems to trap less tp than scheme iii however the difference between scheme ii and scheme iii is not significant it is worth noting that under the operation schemes ii and iii the retention rate in the dry season is significantly lower than that in the wet season and that under scheme i and even become negative in the dry season fig 9c the tp retention rate depends on the hydraulic residence time as well as the parameter σ that describes tp loss from water column as described in section 2 3 for the hydropower reservoirs they usually store some water in flood season for the prospective use in the dry season which would also trap a part of phosphorus flux at the same time the operation scheme ii and scheme iii represent operation modes of hydropower station which lead to much smaller hydraulic residence time in dry season than scheme i fig 10 considering the uncertainty explained in section 2 3 if the parameter σ is not big enough to make the trapped tp settle the trapped tp would be released in the dry season and thus leads to a negative value of retention rate wu and liu 2012 have made the similar explanation on the negative value of nutrient retention rate in their work 3 5 relevance to the downstream region it is of great concern about the dams in lrb would significantly impact the nutrients balance in the lower lancang mekong river basin the lower lmrb means the part outside china in this paper trang et al trang et al 2017 estimated a cumulative annual tp load of 360 336 tons year from sekong srepok and sesan basins 3s basin a sub basin in the lower mekong river basin with a drainage area of 78 529 km2 about 10 of the total area of entire lancang mekong river basin however yoshimura et al yoshimura et al 2009 s estimate is an order of magnitude lower which is 363 000 tons year for the entire lancang mekong river basin 795 500 km2 the annual export of tp at the estuary is estimated to be 900 tons year yoshimura et al 2009 indicating that 97 of the tp load is dissipated within the basin through various processes while these two previous studies have remarkably different estimates they both imply a limited contribution of the lrb to the tp balance in the lower lmrb for example if the more conservative estimate yoshimura et al 2009 is compared against the tp load i e 27 079 tons year in bs experiment occurred in the lrb only accounts for 7 5 of the total load of the entire lmrb i e 27 079 out of 363 000 tons year the delivered ratio of the tp flux at the outlet of the lrb i e 14 112 tons year in bs scenario over the total tp loads in the lower lmrb i e 363 000 minus 27 079 tons year is only 4 2 because the retention rate by the dams ranges from 50 to 59 see table 6 the overall change in the delivered ratio tp flux out of lrb divided by the tp loading in the lower lmrb that would be induced by the development of cascade reservoirs in china can be estimated as from 4 2 to 1 7 2 1 which are both really small for the mekong river basin as described above lrb accounts for about 20 of the area and 16 of the runoff of the entire lancang mekong river basin while it accounts for only 7 5 of the tp loads rare human activities seem to be the primary reason based on the land use map about 84 of the lrb area is covered by natural vegetation forest and grassland and only less than 9 is covered by farmland for the lower lmrb the farmland accounts for about 33 3 of the total area and this will continuously increase based on the changes in population gdp and the current land use yoshimura et al 2009 in the 3s basin the farmland accounts for about 13 2 trang et al 2017 and about 11 6 oeurng et al 2016 of the area according to two studies the lower lmrb supports more than 60 million people s life about 1 3 for the total population in thailand laos cambodia and vietnam and it is important for ensuring the food security based on its fertile land and water resources mrc 2005 besides the mekong delta is an asian center of rice production producing half the rice for vietnam fao 2002 according to kondolf et al 2018 there are more than 40 population centers along the major rivers in the lower lmrb while there are only 3 population centers in the lrb hence there may be more waste water discharge in the lower mekong river basin due to the urban development and population increase mrc 2005 mrc 2007 in contrast there are much fewer human activities such as fertilization use industrial wastewater discharge in the lrb due to the cold weather conditions in qinghai and tibet province steep terrain mountainous are much more than plains which leads to the limited contribution rate of tp to sum up for the concern about potential eutrophic status in the lower lancang mekong river li and bush 2015 oeurng et al 2016 trang et al 2017 yoshimura et al 2009 the lrb accounts for only 7 5 of the tp loads of the entire lancang mekong river basin and has smaller rising tendency in the farm land area compared to the lower lmrb for the concern about the tp interception and the decline of ecological function fang et al 2015 kuenzer et al 2013 wei et al 2009 wild et al 2016 the chinese dams in lrb really have significant impacts on the tp retention in the chinese part of lancang mekong river basin which has possibilities to impact instream tp flux in a certain distance downstream of the lancang mekong border as for the entire mekong river the impact on the phosphorus balance is little delivered ratio changes from 4 2 to 1 7 2 1 according to the modeling results especially for the estuarine delta which need future demonstration based on the continuous water quality observation after more dams completed more comprehensive analysis about the dams influence on the aquatic ecosystem of the lower mekong river basin need to be carried out combined with other nutrients such as nitrogen 4 conclusions total phosphorus tp is an essential indicator for instream ecological systems especially for transborder rivers supporting fisheries knowledge of spatial temporal patterns of tp load and the transborder flux of tp is essential for river basin management in this study the swat model was applied to map tp loads in the upper lancang mekong river basin in china i e the lancang river basin lrb the model was calibrated against three hydrological stations and one water quality station within the basin and the calibration results were demonstrated to be reasonable for exploring the transborder impact on the tp transport by the human activities in the lrb the process based swat model was further used for obtaining the tp loads changes under a series of dam construction scenarios in the future key findings of this study are as follow 1 annual tp loads from the land areas to water bodies is 27 079 tons on average of which 14 112 tons are transported to the basin outlet under the no dam scenario the tp loads in the midstream and downstream locations are much larger than that in the upstream location and the catchment areas of the tributaries have a larger tp loads coefficient 0 15 8 19 kg ha 1 y 1 than that of the main channel 0 08 2 50 kg ha 1 y 1 see fig 5a due to the spatial distribution of human activities the annual tp loads follow the tendency of surface runoff at four typical comparison points of the basin tp loads have the most significant value from july to october contributing 85 of tp loads throughout the year tp loads from the soil weathering and erosion swe were largest followed by animal feedlot and rural household afrh agricultural planting and fertilization af and industrial and domestic wastewater idw with tp contributions of 82 10 4 and 4 for the whole year respectively 2 the dams 9 experiments will decrease 50 59 of the tp export at the outlet of lrb on average of 2000 monte carlo simulation samples σ ranges from 0 5 to 10 y 1 compared to the no dam scenario the parameter σ in the mass balance model has a huge impact on the instream tp flux which indicates the importance of having better estimates of σ in future studies the reservoirs that are under construction and are waiting for construction permissions would not significantly deteriorate the retention of tp due to the reservoir sizes and locating sites tp retention efficiency during flood season is similar to the annual mean and larger than that in the dry season the impact of different operation schemes on the tp exports is not obvious due to the reservoir regulating abilities and the reservoir operation objectives for the concern about the transborder tp delivery the tp flux from lrb to the lower lmrb only accounts for about 4 2 of the total tp loads in the mekong river basin under no dam scenario according to the modeling results and previous studies considering the dams influence on the tp balance in lower mekong river this ratio would decrease 2 1 2 5 under different dam construction scenarios the dam construction in the lrb has a small impact in the lower lmrb with regard the loading of tp and the impact may be limited within a small distance below the outlet of the lancang river the dam construction might have a more significant impact in the lower lmrb with regard to other nutrients such as nitrogen further studies are needed the results of this study would be useful for understanding the potential trans border impact of dam construction on the phosphorus balance in such disputed area i e lancang mekong river basin this study also supplies a tp loading map in lrb which could help to further investigate water quality ecological impact proper management strategies of this region the tp loading map could also supply to study the energy water food nexus problem in this complex region with comprehensive demand such as hydropower water quality protection

5132,in eumseong republic of korea a controlled co2 release site was designed by korea co2 storage environmental management k cosem research center to evaluate properly integrated co2 monitoring tools at the soil surface co2 was released from the 55 m length pvc pipe buried at 2 5 m depth and then co2 concentration and flux were monitored from august 1 2015 to march 21 2018 965 days influencing environmental factors such as meteorological data soil moisture and temperature at 5 different depths were monitored concurrently the measured soil moisture content decreased rapidly when the soil temperature dropped below 0 c when co2 release began both surface co2 flux and soil co2 concentration increased with a time lag however with occurrence of precipitation events co2 flux decreased to almost 0 cm3 cm 2 day 1 but soil co2 concentration increased rapidly the hydrus soilco2 predicted soil moisture temperature and natural background co2 flux compared to measured data r2 0 74 0 89 and 0 85 the 10 scenarios were constructed with different soil characteristic curves unlike soil moisture content the simulated natural co2 flux did not depend heavily on soil characteristics the mass of released co2 was estimated by the difference between the measured co2 flux data during the release test and natural co2 prediction model at the 2nd co2 release test there was 1 5 times difference between the actual released co2 mass and calculated co2 mass keywords co2 flux co2 release soil moisture content meteorological co2 mass 1 introduction as consumption for fossil fuel has been rapidly increasing from the beginning of the 20th century the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are increased sharply cox et al 2000 ipcc 2014 to mitigate atmospheric co2 concentration various efforts including development of clean renewable energy and carbon capture and sequestration ccs are being considered by many countries around the world arnette 2017 dai et al 2018 figueroa et al 2008 metz et al 2005 nanda et al 2016 schrag 2009 one of the ways to regulate co2 emission to the atmosphere is the ccs technology which is used to capture co2 directly from the coal based power plants before co2 is emitted to the atmosphere the captured co2 is transported and then stored in geologically stable formations such as deep saline aquifers and depleted oil or gas fields cui et al 2018 pires et al 2011 white et al 2003 until now co2 has already been stored in various countries some of the examples include the illinois basin decatur project in the u s and the sleipner gas field in the north sea west of norway finley 2014 korbol and kaddour 1995 however the stored co2 could leak from the storage formations through unexpected pathways such as faults or abandoned wells while leaving evidences of co2 leakage at the surface gershenzon et al 2015 keating et al 2010 little and jackson 2010 soltanian et al 2019 stevens et al 2001 vialle et al 2016 vilarrasa et al 2016 such evidences appearing at the surface include co2 rich springs periodically erupting co2 driven cold water geysers and zones of locally barren forests delkhahi et al 2020 farrar et al 1995 han et al 2013 the co2 that leaks from the storage formations eventually reaches the unsaturated or vadose zones where uncompacted soils are partially saturated with both air and water the co2 migrating through such unsaturated soils undergoes dynamical changes due to variations in the soil characteristics and moisture contents which are caused by frequent precipitation events daily or seasonal variations in the soil and atmospheric temperatures and also by the co2 production from biological activities including microorganisms and plants roots buyanovsky and wagner 1983 edwards 1975 silvola et al 1996 šimůnek and suarez 1993 studies on naturally releasing co2 through unsaturated zones were primarily carried out at both agricultural and volcanic areas as exemplary studies conducted at agricultural fields kato et al 2014 measured both co2 concentration and soil moisture content at various depths in an arable bare land tokyo and also monitored surface co2 flux such monitored field data were evaluated to predict the co2 production rates using hydrus soilco2 similarly buchner et al 2008 monitored co2 concentration and fluxes in an agricultural field in the sacramento valley california to evaluate the effects of different tillage practices on co2 emissions this study found that patterns of co2 emissions were closely related to the irrigation event crop and soil characteristics other studies have focused on the dynamics of naturally releasing co2 adjacent to volcanic areas viveiros et al 2009 measured large amount of released co2 gas at the soil surface of the sao miguel volcanic island in portugal and conducted multiple regression analyses to identify the relationships between meteorological variables and the co2 degassing rate they highlighted the important role of meteorological conditions on natural variation of the co2 emission rate additional to studies associated with naturally releasing co2 other researchers had evaluated co2 dynamics at controlled co2 release facilities where co2 were released from pipes buried in the shallow soil for example the zero emission research and technology center zert co2 release test in bozeman montana usa was designed to release co2 from shallow subsurface identify leaked co2 pathways through the soil profile and analyze the changes in the chemistry of groundwater kharaka et al 2018 spangler et al 2010 strazisar et al 2009 the goal of the project was to develop reliable co2 detection technologies and design co2 monitoring strategies another controlled co2 release test was conducted to identify the effect of elevated co2 concentration on biological plants and microbial activities at the asgard field site near nottingham england periodically from march 2006 to 2013 lake et al 2017 smith et al 2013 similar to these previous studies the present study attempts to investigate the relationship between natural environmental factors and the dynamic co2 behavior by designing a controlled co2 release site in the republic of korea and also to calibrate the monitored co2 fluxes using a numerical model various environmental and meteorological parameters such as soil moisture content soil temperature co2 flux and concentration were collected at multiple soil depths and locations from august 1 2015 to march 21 2018 965 days and were analyzed through statistical and numerical approaches after calibrating the simulated co2 fluxes to monitored co2 fluxes at the field difference between simulated and monitored co2 fluxes was estimated during the period of each co2 release test 2 controlled co2 release experiment at eumseong in south korea 2 1 site descriptions and monitoring sensors in 2014 the korea co2 storage environmental management k cosem research center constructed the environment impact evaluation test eit facility to study shallow co2 leakage processes at the controlled co2 release site lee et al 2016 the constructed eit site is located at eumseong chungcheongbuk do province approximately 100 km south from seoul in south korea fig 1 a two co2 release test zones were constructed to investigate shallow co2 release processes through both unsaturated and saturated media fig 1b the goal of the shallow co2 release test conducted at the unsaturated eit site was to evaluate physical chemical and biological alterations caused by elevated co2 flux and concentration in soil media kim et al 2018 in addition associated impacts on soil properties e g soil moisture content and soil temperature meteorological properties e g atmospheric pressure temperature precipitation and wind speed and ecological factors e g vegetation and microorganisms were investigated at a location northeast of the eit site the co2 release test was conducted a few meters below the groundwater table the saturated eit site jun et al 2017 here the process of co2 leakage through the saturated media was investigated as well as associated effects on the groundwater system via chemical and mineralogical evolution see lee et al 2016 for more information about the saturated eit site the present study specifically focused on co2 leakage process through the unsaturated eit site prior to releasing co2 at the unsaturated eit site a site characterization was conducted between august and september 2014 5 wells bh 1 2 3 4 and 5 were drilled to characterize the type and thickness of the soils and their mineralogical compositions and to determine the depth to the groundwater table fig 1b a gradient of the surface elevation was approximately 2 m from the north to south end of the eit site but within both saturated and unsaturated eit sites each surface was almost flat here the groundwater table positioning at depths between 14 m and 15 m below the surface resembles the surface topography the measured hydraulic gradient was 0 004 indicating that the local groundwater flows from northwest to southeast at the eit site fig 1b jun et al 2017 the unsaturated eit site consisting of 5 zones covered an area of 55 m by 20 m fig 2 a the zones 1 to 4 individually covered an area of 10 m by 20 m but zone 5 had a dimension of 15 m by 20 m the co2 release pipe made by a pvc was buried at a depth of 2 5 m crossing through the center of zones 1 to 5 fig 2b the pvc pipe was 55 m long with a diameter of 10 cm within the pipe 4 tubes with the diameter of 1 cm were inserted to release co2 and the pipe was segregated by inserting separation walls at every 10 m to control the co2 release at a designated zone within each zone the co2 release interval 1 m was positioned at 2 5 m away from the separation wall the meteorological station was located 10 m southeast from zone 3 fig 2a the station was equipped with devices to measure precipitation atmospheric temperature wind speed relative humidity and air pressure these parameters were monitored every 10 min a 5tm ec tm sensors decagon inc usa measuring both soil moisture content and soil temperature were installed at 5 different soil depths of 30 60 90 120 and 150 cm in zone 3 fig 2a and b to monitor gaseous co2 concentrations in soils a total of 15 nondispersive infrared ndir co2 sensors gmp221 diameter 18 5 mm and length 109 mm coupled with gmt221 transmitters were installed at 3 different depths of 15 30 and 60 cm immediately above the pvc pipe in addition gmp221 were also installed at the same depths located 1 5 3 0 4 5 and 6 0 m away from the pvc pipe fig 2a these gmp221 sensors measured gaseous co2 concentration every 10 min at zone 3 finally the li cor 8100a suited with 5 mobile chambers were installed at zone 3 fig 2a and measured both the surface co2 flux and gaseous co2 concentration every 30 min the 5 mobile chambers were positioned directly above the pvc pipe 0 m and distanced 1 5 m 3 0 m 4 5 m and 6 0 m away from the pvc pipe to measure the degree of horizontal co2 dispersion 2 2 co2 release periods and co2 soil meteorological monitoring the co2 release tests were conducted 4 times from august 1 2015 to march 21 2018 fig 3 the 1st co2 release test was conducted at zones 2 3 and 4 for 5 days 120 h from october 26 to 30 2015 table 1 the co2 releasing rate was 12 l min and a total amount of 389 kg co2 was released the purpose of the 1st co2 release test was to determine whether the installed sensors were properly operational by detecting the horizontal and vertical spreading of co2 plume the 2nd co2 release test was benchmarked similar to the controlled co2 release test conducted by zert project spangler et al 2010 in the 2nd test the co2 was released through zones 1 2 3 and 4 from june 1 to 30 2016 30 days 720 h at the rate of 6 l min the total amount of released co2 was 1 832 kg from october 3 to 7 2016 5 days 120 h the 3rd co2 release test was conducted the co2 was released only at zone 3 for a short period but with a doubled rate 12 l min relatively small amount of co2 was released 127 kg different from 2nd co2 release test the goal of 3rd test was to evaluate the leakage pattern when a large amount of co2 was suddenly released finally the 4th co2 release test was conducted for 30 days from june 20 to july 20 2017 with even small release rate 3 l min and the total amount of the released co2 was 2 749 kg especially significant precipitation events occurred during the 4th release period causing to large fluctuations in surface co2 fluxes therefore the measured co2 flux in this period was considered to be less reliable relative to other tests further detailed description of co2 release test is also addressed in supplement description while co2 was released through the 4 experiments both co2 concentrations and co2 fluxes were monitored at shallow soil depths 15 30 and 60 cm and at the surface respectively fig 3a and b during the 1st co2 release test co2 fluxes were monitored from august 1 2015 to january 31 2016 during the 2nd co2 release test both soil co2 concentrations and co2 fluxes were monitored soil co2 concentrations were measured for 53 days from june 1 to july 22 2016 and co2 fluxes were monitored for 117 days from may 29 to september 22 2016 during the 3rd co2 release test the co2 flux was monitored only for 133 days from october 12 2016 to february 22 2017 finally the co2 flux was monitored for 22 days from july 13 to august 4 2017 during the 4th co2 release experiment additionally to understand the impact of environmental factors on released co2 various meteorological datasets such as daily meteorological data daily precipitation d p mm atmospheric temperature t avg d c wind speed w avg d m s relative humidity rh avg d air pressure p avg d mbar soil moisture content θ soil cm 3 cm 3 and soil temperature t soil c were monitored at the eit site the meteorological data were measured for 965 days from july 1 2015 to march 21 2018 the detailed description of meteorological data monitored at both eit site and cheongju weather station 30 km distanced from eit site is shown in supplement fig s1 finally the time domain reflectometry tdr sensor and thermocouples continuously monitored the θ soil cm 3 cm 3 and t soil c respectively for the same period 3 analysis of the observed time series data 3 1 soil data both soil moisture content θ soil and soil temperature t soil measured at 30 cm depth are plotted with meteorological data precipitation and atmospheric temperature and co2 data co2 concentration and flux fig 3a the pink shaded areas indicate the periods of co2 release tests in general the measured θ soil increased at the occurrence of precipitation events however precipitation events did not always increase the θ soil for example from august to october 2015 θ soil measured at 30 cm was almost constant 0 14 cm3 cm 3 even when multiple events of small discontinued precipitation occurred section a in fig 3a in contrast when the precipitation events continued for more than 3 days from november 7 to 9 2015 accumulated precipitation was 50 1 mm the θ soil increased from 0 14 cm3 cm 3 to 0 18 cm3 cm 3 fig 4 shows the θ soil measured at the depths of 30 60 90 120 and 150 cm from august 2015 to july 2016 the precipitation events from november 7 to 9 2015 section b in fig 4 resulted in large and immediate fluctuations in θ soil at 30 and 60 cm depths θ soil increased from 0 15 to 0 19 cm3 cm 3 at both the depths however fluctuations of θ soil at 120 and 150 cm were relatively small and revealed lagged responses the θ soil was also affected by t soil and such effects were strong at the shallow depths for example when t soil fell below 0 c between january 25 and february 14 2016 θ soil at 30 cm decreased abruptly to 0 1 cm3 cm 3 section c in fig 4 and supplement fig s2 however the θ soil measured at the deeper depths greater than 60 cm did not show a significant decrease after the precipitation events on february 14 2016 and when t soil increased to over 1 c the θ soil at 30 cm increased abruptly from 0 11 to 0 23 cm3 cm 3 indicating the thaw of the frozen ices in the soils 3 2 co2 concentration and co2 flux the daily averages of surface co2 flux and co2 concentrations at 30 cm depth are plotted in fig 3a the released co2 amount and duration in the 2nd co2 release test were much larger and longer than the 1st co2 release test table 1 the maximum value of the measured co2 fluxes 19 09 cm3 cm 2 day 1 for the 2nd co2 release test was approximately 53 times greater than one 0 36 cm3 cm 2 day 1 in the 1st co2 release test during the 3rd co2 release test the amount of released co2 per zone was equal to that released during the 1st co2 release test hence the maximum elevated co2 fluxes were similar in both tests during the 4th release test co2 was released at zone 1 and 2 and elevated co2 fluxes were monitored at zone 3 in general the co2 fluxes showed elevated values in the summer season due to growing activities of microorganism and root respiration in the soil profiles but co2 fluxes decreased during the winter season davidson et al 1998 also co2 fluxes were influenced by the precipitation events similar to the observation by mariko et al 2007 for example the precipitation events on both july 4 and august 31 2016 induced a decrease in the co2 fluxes from 10 5 to 0 7 cm3 cm 2 day 1 and from 1 5 to 0 15 cm3 cm 2 day 1 respectively fig 3a for a detailed analysis spatial and temporal distribution of both co2 fluxes and concentrations monitored during the 2nd co2 release test are plotted fig 5 a and 5b co2 fluxes measured immediately above the pvc pipe 0 m increased 3 days after the co2 release on june 1 2016 fig 5a indicating that it took 3 days for co2 to reach the surface from the pvc pipe buried at 2 5 m depth afterwards the co2 flux gradually increased to 10 cm2 cm 3 day 1 until june 19 2016 between june 19 and june 24 the co2 flux was maintained relatively stable 10 15 cm2 cm 3 day 1 later with the precipitation events on both june 23 and 24 the co2 flux reached a maximum 24 2 cm2 cm 3 day 1 and then suddenly decreased to 5 1 cm2 cm 3 day 1 after the precipitation stopped on june 24 the co2 flux remained in the range of 10 15 cm2 cm 3 day 1 until the 2nd co2 release test was ceased on july 1 2016 with major precipitation events 70 mm co2 flux fell close to zero a similar trend was observed for co2 fluxes measured at other locations 1 5 and 3 m however at a distance of 4 5 m away from the co2 release pipe the co2 flux did not show any significant fluctuation which indicates that the released co2 did not disperse horizontally more than 4 5 m in this soil unlike the co2 flux co2 concentration measured at 0 m began to increase approximately 10 days after the co2 release test june 10 2016 in fig 5b among the co2 concentrations measured at various depths the highest co2 concentration appeared at the depth of 60 cm the effect of precipitation events on co2 concentration were distinct co2 concentrations measured at 15 30 and 60 cm depths increased sharply on june 24 after the precipitation events the maximum co2 concentration 17 6 was detected after the precipitation on july 5 2016 similarly kato et al 2014 noted that the co2 concentrations in the soil increased after the precipitation because the infiltrating rainwater dissolves gaseous co2 in the soil the co2 concentration measured at 3 m away from the pvc pipe increased up to 4 during the co2 release test and remained 3 at all depths the co2 concentration at 6 m away from pipe was the least affected by the co2 release test 4 numerical models 4 1 conceptual model to predict the soil co2 dynamics at the eit site the hydrus soilco2 module was utilized which simulates the transport of water heat and co2 in an unsaturated soil as a function of soil moisture content soil temperature vegetation microorganism and weather šimůnek and suarez 1993 the detailed description of governing equations in hydrus soilco2 is shown in supplement description the location where the li cor 8100a was installed was set to be the modeled location where to simulate variations of soil moisture contents soil temperature and co2 flux soil surface immediately above the pvc pipe at zone 3 as delineated in fig 2a the depth of the modeled soil profile was 250 cm equivalent to the depth of the buried pvc pipe the number of grid blocks was 250 with the size to be 1 cm at the upper surface boundary the atmospheric boundary condition with surface runoff was assigned here the water flux was controlled by assigned parameters delineating both precipitation d p and potential evaporation the d p is shown in fig 3a and the potential evaporation was calculated using the following equations 1 e k e v a e sat t s w a e sat t a 2 e sat t s 6 11 e x p 17 3 t s t s 237 3 where the e is the rate of potential evaporation ke is the coefficient that reflects the vertical transport of water vapor and va is the wind speed the esat is the saturated vapor pressure which is dependent on the surface temperature ts or atmospheric temperature ta in addition wa is the relative humidity the e cm day was calculated using measured meteorological data at the eit site supplement fig s1a at the lower boundary the free drainage condition equivalent to a zero gradient boundary was assigned to simulate a freely draining water through the soil profile such a boundary condition explains the situation where the groundwater table lies far below the domain of interest for example the model represents the soil depth of 2 5 m but the groundwater table at the eit site is located at 14 15 m below the surface at the upper boundary for heat transport the dirichlet type boundary condition was used as a sine function adapted to represent the t avg d changes of the soil surface 3 t t avg d a sin 2 π t l t d 7 π 12 where t avg d is the daily average temperature a is the amplitude of the sine function 5 c t l is the local time and t d is day length 24 hr at the lower boundary the soil temperatures which were measured at 150 cm were assigned supplement fig s2 other related thermal parameters addressed in eq s3 and s4 are listed in table 2 chung and horton 1987 finally transport parameters and production rates for co2 were adapted from suarez and šimůnek 1993 as shown in table 2 the upper co2 boundary was set to be the dirichlet boundary condition where the co2 concentration is equal to be 440 ppm reflecting the average atmospheric co2 concentration in addition the co2 production from the respiration of plant roots was excluded in the model because of no vegetations in zone 3 the lower co2 boundary condition was set to be the zero gradient boundary to simulate a free co2 draining condition to the deep soil 4 2 modeling scenarios to analyze in situ soil characteristics soil samples were collected at 100 cm depth from 4 different points s1 s2 s3 and s4 in fig 2a the soil samples were classified to be a loamy sand at s1 and sandy loam at s2 s3 s4 after delineating on the usda soil ternary diagram fig 6 a and table 3 after analyzing the measured soil textures a total of 10 modeling scenarios were developed of which each scenario reflected a different soil characteristic curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity fig 6b and table 4 carsel and parrish 1988 schaap et al 2001 the soil characteristic curve of case 1 was calculated from the soil fraction of s1 loamy sand collected from zone 5 case 2 was the average soil fraction sandy loam of s1 s2 s3 and s4 for cases 3 to 6 the soil fraction of s3 was applied but soil characteristic curve in each case was predicted from the rosetta module which is the neural prediction program to estimate soil characteristic curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity schaap et al 2001 even though the soil samples were collected at the same location the in situ soil bulk density could be different depending on the sampling depth the bulk density of unconsolidated soil at the surface can be small but vice versa at a deeper depth therefore soil bulk densities varied from 1 4 to 2 0 g cm 3 through cases 3 to 6 table 4 similarly through cases 7 to 10 the average soil fraction of s1 s2 s3 and s4 was applied while varying the bulk density of the soil table 4 summarizes the predicted parameters used to predict the soil characteristic curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity 5 results and discussion 5 1 soil temperature t soil the top plot in fig 7 a shows the comparison between the daily averages of measured soil temperature t soil and simulated t soil at 60 cm the t soil was simulated with soil thermal parameters representing sand because sand is the dominant soil through the eit site table 3 chung and horton 1987 throughout the experimental period from august 1 2015 to march 21 2018 the simulated t soil revealing the seasonal variation was almost in accordance to the measured t soil the normalized root mean square error nrmse and the coefficient of correlation r2 were calculated as 2 272 and 0 89 respectively even small drops in t soil due to precipitation events appeared in the simulated t soil profile nevertheless when the measured t soil was either above 25 c or below 0 c there were deviations between simulated and measured t soil the season when the t soil is above 25 c was mostly coincident with the heavy rain season although both warm temperature and concentrated precipitation events accelerate evapotranspiration the model has limitations in predicting such active evaporation also when the t soil was below 0 c the simulated t soil was overestimated such differences occurred because the snow or ice that accumulated on the soil surface in the winter prevented heat loss from the soil zhang et al 2008 5 2 soil moisture content θ soil 5 2 1 temporal variation of soil moisture content θ soil in fig 7a the measured θ soil green dots were plotted with simulated θ soil from 6 cases cases 1 2 3 6 7 and 10 among a total of 10 cases as mentioned in section 3 1 the measured θ soil in general increased after the precipitation events however when the surface soils were frozen θ soil was decreased blue shaded area all of the 6 simulated cases showed variations in θ soil similar to the measured θ soil but dependent on the different soil properties both degree of fluctuation and mean of θ soil were different for case 1 black line representing the soil characteristic curve of a loamy sand the estimated saturated ks was the largest 350 2 cm day among the 10 cases table 4 the saturated soil moisture content θ s and residual soil moisture content θ r was 0 41 cm3 cm 3 and 0 057 cm3 cm 3 respectively and the suction head log10 h varied between 0 and 2 cm fig 6b the simulated results showed that the average θ soil during the measured period was 0 1175 cm3 cm 3 with the minimum of 0 0891 cm3 cm 3 on november 25 2017 fig 7a the maximum θ soil 0 2432 cm3 cm 3 occurred on july 10 2017 after consecutive precipitation events 82 mm for 3 days the θ soil increased up to 0 2 cm3 cm 3 with large precipitation events recording more than 50 mm e g june 10 2016 june 18 and july 8 2017 however when there were no precipitation events the θ soil decreased exponentially due to large ks and small suction head for case 1 as a comparison to case 1 case 2 sandy loam highlighted to be a small ks 106 1 cm day but large suction head table 4 and fig 6b although both case 1 and 2 had the same θ s 0 41 cm3 cm 3 both parameters α and n were different due to small ks and large suction head in case 2 the simulated θ soil was in general high in the soil profile fig 7a as seen case 2 had a larger average θ soil 0 1638 cm3 cm 3 than case 1 0 1175 cm3 cm 3 with a minimum of 0 1233 cm3 cm 3 on june 29 2017 and a maximum of 0 3293 cm3 cm 3 on july 10 2017 overall the simulated results revealed that θ soil profiles of both case 1 and 2 were smaller than measured θ soil the soil characteristic curves of case 3 6 7 and 10 were predicted from the rosetta module schaap et al 2001 here case 3 and 6 were the representatives of the soil properties from the sampling location at s3 while case 7 and 10 represent the average of all sampling points s1 s2 s3 and s4 table 4 case 3 1 4 g cm 3 has a smaller bulk density than case 6 2 0 g cm 3 causing the significantly different soil characteristic curves in the soil characteristic curves the primary difference between case 3 and 6 was the θ s case 3 0 4180 and case 6 0 2630 cm3 cm 3 and ks case 3 110 27 and case 6 11 20 cm day 1 table 4 and fig 6b due to such differences responses of θ soil to major precipitation events were different from each other the maximum θ soil in case 3 0 35 cm3 cm 3 on july 2 2017 for example was higher than case 6 0 25 cm3 cm 3 on july 2 2017 nevertheless both case 3 and 6 have similar θ r case 3 0 0483 and case 6 0 0398 cm3 cm 3 due to similarity in θ r overall average θ soil was similar case 3 0 1755 and case 6 0 1749 cm3 cm 3 fig 7a for the same reason for case 7 and 10 with the average soil data of all sampling locations but different soil bulk density the average θ soil was similar in both case 7 0 1938 cm3 cm 3 and case 10 0 1966 cm3 cm 3 the response of θ soil to precipitation events however was different due to the large difference in θ s case 7 0 4189 and case 10 0 2647 cm3 cm 3 5 2 2 measured and simulated soil moisture content θ soil fig 7b shows the measured and simulated θ soil and the associated statistical measures such as the nrmse and the r2 are given in table 5 between case 1 and 2 representing the soil types of loamy sand and sandy loam respectively case 2 showed improved prediction nrmse 0 0222 and r2 0 7027 among case 3 4 5 and 6 which were based on soil type of s3 but represented different soil bulk density case 6 revealed the closest prediction to the measured θ soil nrmse 0 0203 and r2 0 7402 the simulated θ soil from case 7 8 9 and 10 using the averaged soil data showed similar trends as that of case 3 4 5 and 6 compared to the soil types of s3 case 3 4 5 and 6 the average of soil types case 7 8 9 and 10 overestimated the measured θ soil in summary among the 10 simulation cases case 6 has the smallest nrmse and the largest r2 5 3 soil co2 flux 5 3 1 temporal variation of soil co2 flux and co2 concentration 1st co2 release test based on case 6 that most closely expresses variations in both t soil and θ soil at the eit site the base case simulation was constructed to simulate the soil co2 fluxes fig 8 the prediction of simulated θ soil during the winter season when the temperature falls below 0 c was poor as explained in section 5 2 nevertheless the background level of the co2 fluxes during the winter season are typically very small due to low microbial activities and therefore such limitations should not be critical to predict the variation in co2 fluxes additionally hydrus soilco2 assumes that advective transport of co2 is negligible compared to co2 diffusion reflecting that diffusive co2 transport only occurs in the soil due to this reason artificial co2 release was not able to be incorporated in the model therefore the study focused on predicting the seasonal variations in natural soil co2 flux and elucidate how environmental factors such as precipitation wind speed radiation and soil temperature affect fluctuations of natural co2 fluxes after calibrating the simulated natural background co2 fluxes with the monitored ones differences between simulated and monitored co2 fluxes during 3 times of co2 release tests were evaluated the difference between monitored co2 flux and simulated natural co2 flux indicates the amount of artificially released co2 fig 8 shows both the simulated outcomes from case 6 and corresponding monitored datasets t soil t avg d d p θ soil and co2 flux plotting from august 1 2015 to march 21 2018 high resolution co2 fluxes dataset are available for 183 days from august 1 2015 to january 31 2016 covering the 1st co2 release test which is magnified in fig 9 when the measurement of co2 flux began on august 1 2015 the t avg d was almost 30 c hot summer temperatures accelerated microbial activity in the soil and induced elevated natural co2 flux up to 0 6 cm3 cm 2 day 1 despite the variations in co2 flux the peak occurred between august 3 and 5 2015 afterwards the co2 flux gradually decreased to below 0 1 cm3 cm 2 day 1 until january 28 2016 the decreasing pattern of co2 flux correlated well with the t avg d from time to time when precipitation and strong wind events occurred drops in co2 flux were observed e g august 2 and 20 september 11 october 1 and 27 november 7 13 16 and 25 and december 3 2015 in fig 9 case 2 representing soil hydraulic parameters for sandy loam is also plotted the primary differences between case 2 and 6 were the saturated porosity θ s case 2 0 410 cm3 cm 3 and case 6 0 263 cm3 cm 3 and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks case 2 106 1 cm day and case 6 11 20 cm day despite the differences in soil properties there were no significant differences in simulated co2 fluxes between two cases for example in case 6 cumulative co2 fluxes for 183 days was 41 1 cm3 cm 2 the nrmse and r2 were 0 118 cm3 cm 2 day 1 and 0 8485 respectively compared with the monitored co2 fluxes similarly case 2 revealed cumulative co2 fluxes of 42 4 cm3 cm 2 with nrmse of 0 124 cm3 cm 2 day 1 and r2 of 0 8322 the trend of simulated co2 fluxes in both cases were closely related with the t avg d additionally precipitation events frequently caused drops in co2 fluxes in both cases implying that co2 diffusion through soils was hindered by lack of soil pores with increasing θ soil and thus the increased tortuosity limited co2 diffusion through the soil the limited co2 diffusion resulted in elevated co2 concentration in soil profile when the θ soil increased due to the precipitation events however a degree of elevated co2 concentration at 30 cm depth was different depending on the soil properties for example in case 2 characterized by relatively large θ s and ks co2 concentration purple solid line did not show any significant increase responding to the precipitation events dotted solid line in contrast a relatively large fluctuation of co2 concentration appeared in case 6 green solid line which was characterized by small θs and ks the 1st co2 release test 130 kg co2 release in zone 3 was conducted for 5 days from october 26 to 30 2015 pink box in fig 9 after the 1st co2 release test the measured co2 flux did not show any immediate increase rather it took 6 days until the co2 flux began to increase at the surface the maximum co2 flux recorded during the co2 release test was 0 45 cm3 cm 2 day 1 occurring on november 6 2015 the co2 flux decreased when the precipitation events occurred on november 7 in the same period the simulated co2 reflecting the natural background co2 level was approximately 0 2 cm3 cm 2 day 1 the difference between these two quantities indicates the amount of released co2 approximately 3 06 kg as the total amount of injected co2 during the 1st test was 130 kg the difference between these two quantities was large the reason for such a huge error presumably occurred due to the large precipitation events 27 mm on november 7 2015 which caused the redistribution of co2 within the soil pores in order to improve our prediction the 2nd co2 release tests were conducted 5 3 2 temporal variation of soil co2 flux and co2 concentration 2nd and 3rd co2 release test fig 10 shows additional high resolution co2 flux data monitored from june 1 2016 to february 22 2017 267 days including the periods for the 2nd and 3rd co2 release tests pink shaded area in the 2nd co2 release test co2 was released from june 1 to 30 2016 30 days compared to the 1st co2 release test the co2 release rate in the 2nd test was half but the amount of released co2 was 6 times greater table 1 during the 2nd test the surface co2 flux increased after 3 days of co2 release however co2 flux during the 1st test which was conducted with higher co2 release rate did not increase as early as one during the 2nd test unlike the 2nd test which had no major precipitation events a couple of precipitation events 16 mm occurred on october 27 2015 1 day after the 1st co2 release test began despite a high releasing rate of co2 in the 1st release test co2 flux slowly responded because increased soil moistures due to precipitations prevented co2 rise through pores the drop in co2 flux down to zero was again observed immediately after the multiple precipitation events july 1 16 29 august 31 and september 17 2016 for example after multiple precipitation events 250 mm from july 1 to 5 2016 the measured co2 flux decreased rapidly to almost zero after the rain stopped on july 6 2016 the co2 flux increased back to 2 0 cm3 cm 2 day 1 implying diffusive co2 transport from the 2nd release test approximately 1 6 to 2 0 cm3 cm 2 day 1 of co2 fluxes were maintained until august 28 2016 except for the rainy days section d in fig 10 the simulated case 2 and 6 representing the natural co2 fluxes were fairly similar each other but because of differences in soil hydraulic properties a degree of reduction in co2 flux due to precipitation events was a slightly higher in case 6 than in case 2 the calculated co2 mass between the measured and simulated co2 fluxes was approximately 300 kg during june 1 30 2016 the total amount of released co2 during the 2nd experiment was 458 kg table 1 and approximately 2 3 of the released co2 was able to be captured during the 2nd co2 release test this estimate was more accurate than that from the 1st co2 release test which was affected by precipitation events finally from october 3 to 7 2016 5 days the 3rd co2 release test was conducted the co2 flux was only measured immediately after the end of the co2 release test therefore the fitting of simulated co2 fluxes with measured ones could not be conducted during the 3rd test the maximum co2 flux recorded during the 3rd test was 0 71 cm3 cm 2 on october 15 2016 which later returned to the background level on october 25 2016 6 conclusion the study examined the relationship between naturally occurring soil co2 flux and meteorological factors and then simulated the natural co2 flux at the eit site using the hydrus soilco2 model at the eit site co2 concentration and fluxes were monitored from august 1 2015 to march 21 2018 965 days influencing environmental factors such as meteorological data soil moisture and soil temperature at 5 different depths were monitored concurrently throughout the field observation it was revealed that the soil moisture content decreased rapidly when the soil temperature dropped below 0 c during the winter season in addition both surface co2 flux and soil co2 concentration increased with a time lag after co2 was released interestingly co2 flux decreased to almost 0 cm3 cm2 day 1 when the precipitation events were occurred in order to evaluate the relationship between meteorological factors atmospheric temperature air pressure wind speed and precipitation and co2 flux their correlations were evaluated supplement fig s3 revealing that the co2 flux had a strong positive correlation 0 7526 with the t avg d which is closely related to the growth of soil microorganisms especially a correlation between δd p δ daily precipitation and δco2 flux showed a strong negative correlation 0 7882 such a negative correlation implies that increase in the soil moisture in pores after precipitation events resulted in retardation of gaseous co2 diffusion by increasing tortuosity additional to pearson correlation study monitored seasonal variation in both t soil and θ soil were simulated using the numerical simulator the simulated t soil θ soil and co2 flux in case 6 matched well with the measured t soil r2 0 89 θ soil r2 0 74 and co2 flux r2 0 85 respectively finally the difference between the simulated natural co2 flux and the measured co2 flux during the co2 release test could attribute to the mass of released co2 by analyzing the correlation between meteorological factors and soil co2 the dynamics of diffusive co2 transport could be understood better the soil texture and bulk density were important parameters to simulate soil moisture contents accurately although the hydrus soilco2 model was not able to simulate an artificial co2 release in soil profiles it was still useful to evaluate natural background co2 flux hence could be used to detect abnormal co2 releases it is anticipated that this predictive model could allow early detection of co2 leakage from underground co2 storage sites and contribute systems that can effectively calculate the amount of co2 leakage credit authorship

5132,in eumseong republic of korea a controlled co2 release site was designed by korea co2 storage environmental management k cosem research center to evaluate properly integrated co2 monitoring tools at the soil surface co2 was released from the 55 m length pvc pipe buried at 2 5 m depth and then co2 concentration and flux were monitored from august 1 2015 to march 21 2018 965 days influencing environmental factors such as meteorological data soil moisture and temperature at 5 different depths were monitored concurrently the measured soil moisture content decreased rapidly when the soil temperature dropped below 0 c when co2 release began both surface co2 flux and soil co2 concentration increased with a time lag however with occurrence of precipitation events co2 flux decreased to almost 0 cm3 cm 2 day 1 but soil co2 concentration increased rapidly the hydrus soilco2 predicted soil moisture temperature and natural background co2 flux compared to measured data r2 0 74 0 89 and 0 85 the 10 scenarios were constructed with different soil characteristic curves unlike soil moisture content the simulated natural co2 flux did not depend heavily on soil characteristics the mass of released co2 was estimated by the difference between the measured co2 flux data during the release test and natural co2 prediction model at the 2nd co2 release test there was 1 5 times difference between the actual released co2 mass and calculated co2 mass keywords co2 flux co2 release soil moisture content meteorological co2 mass 1 introduction as consumption for fossil fuel has been rapidly increasing from the beginning of the 20th century the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are increased sharply cox et al 2000 ipcc 2014 to mitigate atmospheric co2 concentration various efforts including development of clean renewable energy and carbon capture and sequestration ccs are being considered by many countries around the world arnette 2017 dai et al 2018 figueroa et al 2008 metz et al 2005 nanda et al 2016 schrag 2009 one of the ways to regulate co2 emission to the atmosphere is the ccs technology which is used to capture co2 directly from the coal based power plants before co2 is emitted to the atmosphere the captured co2 is transported and then stored in geologically stable formations such as deep saline aquifers and depleted oil or gas fields cui et al 2018 pires et al 2011 white et al 2003 until now co2 has already been stored in various countries some of the examples include the illinois basin decatur project in the u s and the sleipner gas field in the north sea west of norway finley 2014 korbol and kaddour 1995 however the stored co2 could leak from the storage formations through unexpected pathways such as faults or abandoned wells while leaving evidences of co2 leakage at the surface gershenzon et al 2015 keating et al 2010 little and jackson 2010 soltanian et al 2019 stevens et al 2001 vialle et al 2016 vilarrasa et al 2016 such evidences appearing at the surface include co2 rich springs periodically erupting co2 driven cold water geysers and zones of locally barren forests delkhahi et al 2020 farrar et al 1995 han et al 2013 the co2 that leaks from the storage formations eventually reaches the unsaturated or vadose zones where uncompacted soils are partially saturated with both air and water the co2 migrating through such unsaturated soils undergoes dynamical changes due to variations in the soil characteristics and moisture contents which are caused by frequent precipitation events daily or seasonal variations in the soil and atmospheric temperatures and also by the co2 production from biological activities including microorganisms and plants roots buyanovsky and wagner 1983 edwards 1975 silvola et al 1996 šimůnek and suarez 1993 studies on naturally releasing co2 through unsaturated zones were primarily carried out at both agricultural and volcanic areas as exemplary studies conducted at agricultural fields kato et al 2014 measured both co2 concentration and soil moisture content at various depths in an arable bare land tokyo and also monitored surface co2 flux such monitored field data were evaluated to predict the co2 production rates using hydrus soilco2 similarly buchner et al 2008 monitored co2 concentration and fluxes in an agricultural field in the sacramento valley california to evaluate the effects of different tillage practices on co2 emissions this study found that patterns of co2 emissions were closely related to the irrigation event crop and soil characteristics other studies have focused on the dynamics of naturally releasing co2 adjacent to volcanic areas viveiros et al 2009 measured large amount of released co2 gas at the soil surface of the sao miguel volcanic island in portugal and conducted multiple regression analyses to identify the relationships between meteorological variables and the co2 degassing rate they highlighted the important role of meteorological conditions on natural variation of the co2 emission rate additional to studies associated with naturally releasing co2 other researchers had evaluated co2 dynamics at controlled co2 release facilities where co2 were released from pipes buried in the shallow soil for example the zero emission research and technology center zert co2 release test in bozeman montana usa was designed to release co2 from shallow subsurface identify leaked co2 pathways through the soil profile and analyze the changes in the chemistry of groundwater kharaka et al 2018 spangler et al 2010 strazisar et al 2009 the goal of the project was to develop reliable co2 detection technologies and design co2 monitoring strategies another controlled co2 release test was conducted to identify the effect of elevated co2 concentration on biological plants and microbial activities at the asgard field site near nottingham england periodically from march 2006 to 2013 lake et al 2017 smith et al 2013 similar to these previous studies the present study attempts to investigate the relationship between natural environmental factors and the dynamic co2 behavior by designing a controlled co2 release site in the republic of korea and also to calibrate the monitored co2 fluxes using a numerical model various environmental and meteorological parameters such as soil moisture content soil temperature co2 flux and concentration were collected at multiple soil depths and locations from august 1 2015 to march 21 2018 965 days and were analyzed through statistical and numerical approaches after calibrating the simulated co2 fluxes to monitored co2 fluxes at the field difference between simulated and monitored co2 fluxes was estimated during the period of each co2 release test 2 controlled co2 release experiment at eumseong in south korea 2 1 site descriptions and monitoring sensors in 2014 the korea co2 storage environmental management k cosem research center constructed the environment impact evaluation test eit facility to study shallow co2 leakage processes at the controlled co2 release site lee et al 2016 the constructed eit site is located at eumseong chungcheongbuk do province approximately 100 km south from seoul in south korea fig 1 a two co2 release test zones were constructed to investigate shallow co2 release processes through both unsaturated and saturated media fig 1b the goal of the shallow co2 release test conducted at the unsaturated eit site was to evaluate physical chemical and biological alterations caused by elevated co2 flux and concentration in soil media kim et al 2018 in addition associated impacts on soil properties e g soil moisture content and soil temperature meteorological properties e g atmospheric pressure temperature precipitation and wind speed and ecological factors e g vegetation and microorganisms were investigated at a location northeast of the eit site the co2 release test was conducted a few meters below the groundwater table the saturated eit site jun et al 2017 here the process of co2 leakage through the saturated media was investigated as well as associated effects on the groundwater system via chemical and mineralogical evolution see lee et al 2016 for more information about the saturated eit site the present study specifically focused on co2 leakage process through the unsaturated eit site prior to releasing co2 at the unsaturated eit site a site characterization was conducted between august and september 2014 5 wells bh 1 2 3 4 and 5 were drilled to characterize the type and thickness of the soils and their mineralogical compositions and to determine the depth to the groundwater table fig 1b a gradient of the surface elevation was approximately 2 m from the north to south end of the eit site but within both saturated and unsaturated eit sites each surface was almost flat here the groundwater table positioning at depths between 14 m and 15 m below the surface resembles the surface topography the measured hydraulic gradient was 0 004 indicating that the local groundwater flows from northwest to southeast at the eit site fig 1b jun et al 2017 the unsaturated eit site consisting of 5 zones covered an area of 55 m by 20 m fig 2 a the zones 1 to 4 individually covered an area of 10 m by 20 m but zone 5 had a dimension of 15 m by 20 m the co2 release pipe made by a pvc was buried at a depth of 2 5 m crossing through the center of zones 1 to 5 fig 2b the pvc pipe was 55 m long with a diameter of 10 cm within the pipe 4 tubes with the diameter of 1 cm were inserted to release co2 and the pipe was segregated by inserting separation walls at every 10 m to control the co2 release at a designated zone within each zone the co2 release interval 1 m was positioned at 2 5 m away from the separation wall the meteorological station was located 10 m southeast from zone 3 fig 2a the station was equipped with devices to measure precipitation atmospheric temperature wind speed relative humidity and air pressure these parameters were monitored every 10 min a 5tm ec tm sensors decagon inc usa measuring both soil moisture content and soil temperature were installed at 5 different soil depths of 30 60 90 120 and 150 cm in zone 3 fig 2a and b to monitor gaseous co2 concentrations in soils a total of 15 nondispersive infrared ndir co2 sensors gmp221 diameter 18 5 mm and length 109 mm coupled with gmt221 transmitters were installed at 3 different depths of 15 30 and 60 cm immediately above the pvc pipe in addition gmp221 were also installed at the same depths located 1 5 3 0 4 5 and 6 0 m away from the pvc pipe fig 2a these gmp221 sensors measured gaseous co2 concentration every 10 min at zone 3 finally the li cor 8100a suited with 5 mobile chambers were installed at zone 3 fig 2a and measured both the surface co2 flux and gaseous co2 concentration every 30 min the 5 mobile chambers were positioned directly above the pvc pipe 0 m and distanced 1 5 m 3 0 m 4 5 m and 6 0 m away from the pvc pipe to measure the degree of horizontal co2 dispersion 2 2 co2 release periods and co2 soil meteorological monitoring the co2 release tests were conducted 4 times from august 1 2015 to march 21 2018 fig 3 the 1st co2 release test was conducted at zones 2 3 and 4 for 5 days 120 h from october 26 to 30 2015 table 1 the co2 releasing rate was 12 l min and a total amount of 389 kg co2 was released the purpose of the 1st co2 release test was to determine whether the installed sensors were properly operational by detecting the horizontal and vertical spreading of co2 plume the 2nd co2 release test was benchmarked similar to the controlled co2 release test conducted by zert project spangler et al 2010 in the 2nd test the co2 was released through zones 1 2 3 and 4 from june 1 to 30 2016 30 days 720 h at the rate of 6 l min the total amount of released co2 was 1 832 kg from october 3 to 7 2016 5 days 120 h the 3rd co2 release test was conducted the co2 was released only at zone 3 for a short period but with a doubled rate 12 l min relatively small amount of co2 was released 127 kg different from 2nd co2 release test the goal of 3rd test was to evaluate the leakage pattern when a large amount of co2 was suddenly released finally the 4th co2 release test was conducted for 30 days from june 20 to july 20 2017 with even small release rate 3 l min and the total amount of the released co2 was 2 749 kg especially significant precipitation events occurred during the 4th release period causing to large fluctuations in surface co2 fluxes therefore the measured co2 flux in this period was considered to be less reliable relative to other tests further detailed description of co2 release test is also addressed in supplement description while co2 was released through the 4 experiments both co2 concentrations and co2 fluxes were monitored at shallow soil depths 15 30 and 60 cm and at the surface respectively fig 3a and b during the 1st co2 release test co2 fluxes were monitored from august 1 2015 to january 31 2016 during the 2nd co2 release test both soil co2 concentrations and co2 fluxes were monitored soil co2 concentrations were measured for 53 days from june 1 to july 22 2016 and co2 fluxes were monitored for 117 days from may 29 to september 22 2016 during the 3rd co2 release test the co2 flux was monitored only for 133 days from october 12 2016 to february 22 2017 finally the co2 flux was monitored for 22 days from july 13 to august 4 2017 during the 4th co2 release experiment additionally to understand the impact of environmental factors on released co2 various meteorological datasets such as daily meteorological data daily precipitation d p mm atmospheric temperature t avg d c wind speed w avg d m s relative humidity rh avg d air pressure p avg d mbar soil moisture content θ soil cm 3 cm 3 and soil temperature t soil c were monitored at the eit site the meteorological data were measured for 965 days from july 1 2015 to march 21 2018 the detailed description of meteorological data monitored at both eit site and cheongju weather station 30 km distanced from eit site is shown in supplement fig s1 finally the time domain reflectometry tdr sensor and thermocouples continuously monitored the θ soil cm 3 cm 3 and t soil c respectively for the same period 3 analysis of the observed time series data 3 1 soil data both soil moisture content θ soil and soil temperature t soil measured at 30 cm depth are plotted with meteorological data precipitation and atmospheric temperature and co2 data co2 concentration and flux fig 3a the pink shaded areas indicate the periods of co2 release tests in general the measured θ soil increased at the occurrence of precipitation events however precipitation events did not always increase the θ soil for example from august to october 2015 θ soil measured at 30 cm was almost constant 0 14 cm3 cm 3 even when multiple events of small discontinued precipitation occurred section a in fig 3a in contrast when the precipitation events continued for more than 3 days from november 7 to 9 2015 accumulated precipitation was 50 1 mm the θ soil increased from 0 14 cm3 cm 3 to 0 18 cm3 cm 3 fig 4 shows the θ soil measured at the depths of 30 60 90 120 and 150 cm from august 2015 to july 2016 the precipitation events from november 7 to 9 2015 section b in fig 4 resulted in large and immediate fluctuations in θ soil at 30 and 60 cm depths θ soil increased from 0 15 to 0 19 cm3 cm 3 at both the depths however fluctuations of θ soil at 120 and 150 cm were relatively small and revealed lagged responses the θ soil was also affected by t soil and such effects were strong at the shallow depths for example when t soil fell below 0 c between january 25 and february 14 2016 θ soil at 30 cm decreased abruptly to 0 1 cm3 cm 3 section c in fig 4 and supplement fig s2 however the θ soil measured at the deeper depths greater than 60 cm did not show a significant decrease after the precipitation events on february 14 2016 and when t soil increased to over 1 c the θ soil at 30 cm increased abruptly from 0 11 to 0 23 cm3 cm 3 indicating the thaw of the frozen ices in the soils 3 2 co2 concentration and co2 flux the daily averages of surface co2 flux and co2 concentrations at 30 cm depth are plotted in fig 3a the released co2 amount and duration in the 2nd co2 release test were much larger and longer than the 1st co2 release test table 1 the maximum value of the measured co2 fluxes 19 09 cm3 cm 2 day 1 for the 2nd co2 release test was approximately 53 times greater than one 0 36 cm3 cm 2 day 1 in the 1st co2 release test during the 3rd co2 release test the amount of released co2 per zone was equal to that released during the 1st co2 release test hence the maximum elevated co2 fluxes were similar in both tests during the 4th release test co2 was released at zone 1 and 2 and elevated co2 fluxes were monitored at zone 3 in general the co2 fluxes showed elevated values in the summer season due to growing activities of microorganism and root respiration in the soil profiles but co2 fluxes decreased during the winter season davidson et al 1998 also co2 fluxes were influenced by the precipitation events similar to the observation by mariko et al 2007 for example the precipitation events on both july 4 and august 31 2016 induced a decrease in the co2 fluxes from 10 5 to 0 7 cm3 cm 2 day 1 and from 1 5 to 0 15 cm3 cm 2 day 1 respectively fig 3a for a detailed analysis spatial and temporal distribution of both co2 fluxes and concentrations monitored during the 2nd co2 release test are plotted fig 5 a and 5b co2 fluxes measured immediately above the pvc pipe 0 m increased 3 days after the co2 release on june 1 2016 fig 5a indicating that it took 3 days for co2 to reach the surface from the pvc pipe buried at 2 5 m depth afterwards the co2 flux gradually increased to 10 cm2 cm 3 day 1 until june 19 2016 between june 19 and june 24 the co2 flux was maintained relatively stable 10 15 cm2 cm 3 day 1 later with the precipitation events on both june 23 and 24 the co2 flux reached a maximum 24 2 cm2 cm 3 day 1 and then suddenly decreased to 5 1 cm2 cm 3 day 1 after the precipitation stopped on june 24 the co2 flux remained in the range of 10 15 cm2 cm 3 day 1 until the 2nd co2 release test was ceased on july 1 2016 with major precipitation events 70 mm co2 flux fell close to zero a similar trend was observed for co2 fluxes measured at other locations 1 5 and 3 m however at a distance of 4 5 m away from the co2 release pipe the co2 flux did not show any significant fluctuation which indicates that the released co2 did not disperse horizontally more than 4 5 m in this soil unlike the co2 flux co2 concentration measured at 0 m began to increase approximately 10 days after the co2 release test june 10 2016 in fig 5b among the co2 concentrations measured at various depths the highest co2 concentration appeared at the depth of 60 cm the effect of precipitation events on co2 concentration were distinct co2 concentrations measured at 15 30 and 60 cm depths increased sharply on june 24 after the precipitation events the maximum co2 concentration 17 6 was detected after the precipitation on july 5 2016 similarly kato et al 2014 noted that the co2 concentrations in the soil increased after the precipitation because the infiltrating rainwater dissolves gaseous co2 in the soil the co2 concentration measured at 3 m away from the pvc pipe increased up to 4 during the co2 release test and remained 3 at all depths the co2 concentration at 6 m away from pipe was the least affected by the co2 release test 4 numerical models 4 1 conceptual model to predict the soil co2 dynamics at the eit site the hydrus soilco2 module was utilized which simulates the transport of water heat and co2 in an unsaturated soil as a function of soil moisture content soil temperature vegetation microorganism and weather šimůnek and suarez 1993 the detailed description of governing equations in hydrus soilco2 is shown in supplement description the location where the li cor 8100a was installed was set to be the modeled location where to simulate variations of soil moisture contents soil temperature and co2 flux soil surface immediately above the pvc pipe at zone 3 as delineated in fig 2a the depth of the modeled soil profile was 250 cm equivalent to the depth of the buried pvc pipe the number of grid blocks was 250 with the size to be 1 cm at the upper surface boundary the atmospheric boundary condition with surface runoff was assigned here the water flux was controlled by assigned parameters delineating both precipitation d p and potential evaporation the d p is shown in fig 3a and the potential evaporation was calculated using the following equations 1 e k e v a e sat t s w a e sat t a 2 e sat t s 6 11 e x p 17 3 t s t s 237 3 where the e is the rate of potential evaporation ke is the coefficient that reflects the vertical transport of water vapor and va is the wind speed the esat is the saturated vapor pressure which is dependent on the surface temperature ts or atmospheric temperature ta in addition wa is the relative humidity the e cm day was calculated using measured meteorological data at the eit site supplement fig s1a at the lower boundary the free drainage condition equivalent to a zero gradient boundary was assigned to simulate a freely draining water through the soil profile such a boundary condition explains the situation where the groundwater table lies far below the domain of interest for example the model represents the soil depth of 2 5 m but the groundwater table at the eit site is located at 14 15 m below the surface at the upper boundary for heat transport the dirichlet type boundary condition was used as a sine function adapted to represent the t avg d changes of the soil surface 3 t t avg d a sin 2 π t l t d 7 π 12 where t avg d is the daily average temperature a is the amplitude of the sine function 5 c t l is the local time and t d is day length 24 hr at the lower boundary the soil temperatures which were measured at 150 cm were assigned supplement fig s2 other related thermal parameters addressed in eq s3 and s4 are listed in table 2 chung and horton 1987 finally transport parameters and production rates for co2 were adapted from suarez and šimůnek 1993 as shown in table 2 the upper co2 boundary was set to be the dirichlet boundary condition where the co2 concentration is equal to be 440 ppm reflecting the average atmospheric co2 concentration in addition the co2 production from the respiration of plant roots was excluded in the model because of no vegetations in zone 3 the lower co2 boundary condition was set to be the zero gradient boundary to simulate a free co2 draining condition to the deep soil 4 2 modeling scenarios to analyze in situ soil characteristics soil samples were collected at 100 cm depth from 4 different points s1 s2 s3 and s4 in fig 2a the soil samples were classified to be a loamy sand at s1 and sandy loam at s2 s3 s4 after delineating on the usda soil ternary diagram fig 6 a and table 3 after analyzing the measured soil textures a total of 10 modeling scenarios were developed of which each scenario reflected a different soil characteristic curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity fig 6b and table 4 carsel and parrish 1988 schaap et al 2001 the soil characteristic curve of case 1 was calculated from the soil fraction of s1 loamy sand collected from zone 5 case 2 was the average soil fraction sandy loam of s1 s2 s3 and s4 for cases 3 to 6 the soil fraction of s3 was applied but soil characteristic curve in each case was predicted from the rosetta module which is the neural prediction program to estimate soil characteristic curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity schaap et al 2001 even though the soil samples were collected at the same location the in situ soil bulk density could be different depending on the sampling depth the bulk density of unconsolidated soil at the surface can be small but vice versa at a deeper depth therefore soil bulk densities varied from 1 4 to 2 0 g cm 3 through cases 3 to 6 table 4 similarly through cases 7 to 10 the average soil fraction of s1 s2 s3 and s4 was applied while varying the bulk density of the soil table 4 summarizes the predicted parameters used to predict the soil characteristic curve and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity 5 results and discussion 5 1 soil temperature t soil the top plot in fig 7 a shows the comparison between the daily averages of measured soil temperature t soil and simulated t soil at 60 cm the t soil was simulated with soil thermal parameters representing sand because sand is the dominant soil through the eit site table 3 chung and horton 1987 throughout the experimental period from august 1 2015 to march 21 2018 the simulated t soil revealing the seasonal variation was almost in accordance to the measured t soil the normalized root mean square error nrmse and the coefficient of correlation r2 were calculated as 2 272 and 0 89 respectively even small drops in t soil due to precipitation events appeared in the simulated t soil profile nevertheless when the measured t soil was either above 25 c or below 0 c there were deviations between simulated and measured t soil the season when the t soil is above 25 c was mostly coincident with the heavy rain season although both warm temperature and concentrated precipitation events accelerate evapotranspiration the model has limitations in predicting such active evaporation also when the t soil was below 0 c the simulated t soil was overestimated such differences occurred because the snow or ice that accumulated on the soil surface in the winter prevented heat loss from the soil zhang et al 2008 5 2 soil moisture content θ soil 5 2 1 temporal variation of soil moisture content θ soil in fig 7a the measured θ soil green dots were plotted with simulated θ soil from 6 cases cases 1 2 3 6 7 and 10 among a total of 10 cases as mentioned in section 3 1 the measured θ soil in general increased after the precipitation events however when the surface soils were frozen θ soil was decreased blue shaded area all of the 6 simulated cases showed variations in θ soil similar to the measured θ soil but dependent on the different soil properties both degree of fluctuation and mean of θ soil were different for case 1 black line representing the soil characteristic curve of a loamy sand the estimated saturated ks was the largest 350 2 cm day among the 10 cases table 4 the saturated soil moisture content θ s and residual soil moisture content θ r was 0 41 cm3 cm 3 and 0 057 cm3 cm 3 respectively and the suction head log10 h varied between 0 and 2 cm fig 6b the simulated results showed that the average θ soil during the measured period was 0 1175 cm3 cm 3 with the minimum of 0 0891 cm3 cm 3 on november 25 2017 fig 7a the maximum θ soil 0 2432 cm3 cm 3 occurred on july 10 2017 after consecutive precipitation events 82 mm for 3 days the θ soil increased up to 0 2 cm3 cm 3 with large precipitation events recording more than 50 mm e g june 10 2016 june 18 and july 8 2017 however when there were no precipitation events the θ soil decreased exponentially due to large ks and small suction head for case 1 as a comparison to case 1 case 2 sandy loam highlighted to be a small ks 106 1 cm day but large suction head table 4 and fig 6b although both case 1 and 2 had the same θ s 0 41 cm3 cm 3 both parameters α and n were different due to small ks and large suction head in case 2 the simulated θ soil was in general high in the soil profile fig 7a as seen case 2 had a larger average θ soil 0 1638 cm3 cm 3 than case 1 0 1175 cm3 cm 3 with a minimum of 0 1233 cm3 cm 3 on june 29 2017 and a maximum of 0 3293 cm3 cm 3 on july 10 2017 overall the simulated results revealed that θ soil profiles of both case 1 and 2 were smaller than measured θ soil the soil characteristic curves of case 3 6 7 and 10 were predicted from the rosetta module schaap et al 2001 here case 3 and 6 were the representatives of the soil properties from the sampling location at s3 while case 7 and 10 represent the average of all sampling points s1 s2 s3 and s4 table 4 case 3 1 4 g cm 3 has a smaller bulk density than case 6 2 0 g cm 3 causing the significantly different soil characteristic curves in the soil characteristic curves the primary difference between case 3 and 6 was the θ s case 3 0 4180 and case 6 0 2630 cm3 cm 3 and ks case 3 110 27 and case 6 11 20 cm day 1 table 4 and fig 6b due to such differences responses of θ soil to major precipitation events were different from each other the maximum θ soil in case 3 0 35 cm3 cm 3 on july 2 2017 for example was higher than case 6 0 25 cm3 cm 3 on july 2 2017 nevertheless both case 3 and 6 have similar θ r case 3 0 0483 and case 6 0 0398 cm3 cm 3 due to similarity in θ r overall average θ soil was similar case 3 0 1755 and case 6 0 1749 cm3 cm 3 fig 7a for the same reason for case 7 and 10 with the average soil data of all sampling locations but different soil bulk density the average θ soil was similar in both case 7 0 1938 cm3 cm 3 and case 10 0 1966 cm3 cm 3 the response of θ soil to precipitation events however was different due to the large difference in θ s case 7 0 4189 and case 10 0 2647 cm3 cm 3 5 2 2 measured and simulated soil moisture content θ soil fig 7b shows the measured and simulated θ soil and the associated statistical measures such as the nrmse and the r2 are given in table 5 between case 1 and 2 representing the soil types of loamy sand and sandy loam respectively case 2 showed improved prediction nrmse 0 0222 and r2 0 7027 among case 3 4 5 and 6 which were based on soil type of s3 but represented different soil bulk density case 6 revealed the closest prediction to the measured θ soil nrmse 0 0203 and r2 0 7402 the simulated θ soil from case 7 8 9 and 10 using the averaged soil data showed similar trends as that of case 3 4 5 and 6 compared to the soil types of s3 case 3 4 5 and 6 the average of soil types case 7 8 9 and 10 overestimated the measured θ soil in summary among the 10 simulation cases case 6 has the smallest nrmse and the largest r2 5 3 soil co2 flux 5 3 1 temporal variation of soil co2 flux and co2 concentration 1st co2 release test based on case 6 that most closely expresses variations in both t soil and θ soil at the eit site the base case simulation was constructed to simulate the soil co2 fluxes fig 8 the prediction of simulated θ soil during the winter season when the temperature falls below 0 c was poor as explained in section 5 2 nevertheless the background level of the co2 fluxes during the winter season are typically very small due to low microbial activities and therefore such limitations should not be critical to predict the variation in co2 fluxes additionally hydrus soilco2 assumes that advective transport of co2 is negligible compared to co2 diffusion reflecting that diffusive co2 transport only occurs in the soil due to this reason artificial co2 release was not able to be incorporated in the model therefore the study focused on predicting the seasonal variations in natural soil co2 flux and elucidate how environmental factors such as precipitation wind speed radiation and soil temperature affect fluctuations of natural co2 fluxes after calibrating the simulated natural background co2 fluxes with the monitored ones differences between simulated and monitored co2 fluxes during 3 times of co2 release tests were evaluated the difference between monitored co2 flux and simulated natural co2 flux indicates the amount of artificially released co2 fig 8 shows both the simulated outcomes from case 6 and corresponding monitored datasets t soil t avg d d p θ soil and co2 flux plotting from august 1 2015 to march 21 2018 high resolution co2 fluxes dataset are available for 183 days from august 1 2015 to january 31 2016 covering the 1st co2 release test which is magnified in fig 9 when the measurement of co2 flux began on august 1 2015 the t avg d was almost 30 c hot summer temperatures accelerated microbial activity in the soil and induced elevated natural co2 flux up to 0 6 cm3 cm 2 day 1 despite the variations in co2 flux the peak occurred between august 3 and 5 2015 afterwards the co2 flux gradually decreased to below 0 1 cm3 cm 2 day 1 until january 28 2016 the decreasing pattern of co2 flux correlated well with the t avg d from time to time when precipitation and strong wind events occurred drops in co2 flux were observed e g august 2 and 20 september 11 october 1 and 27 november 7 13 16 and 25 and december 3 2015 in fig 9 case 2 representing soil hydraulic parameters for sandy loam is also plotted the primary differences between case 2 and 6 were the saturated porosity θ s case 2 0 410 cm3 cm 3 and case 6 0 263 cm3 cm 3 and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks case 2 106 1 cm day and case 6 11 20 cm day despite the differences in soil properties there were no significant differences in simulated co2 fluxes between two cases for example in case 6 cumulative co2 fluxes for 183 days was 41 1 cm3 cm 2 the nrmse and r2 were 0 118 cm3 cm 2 day 1 and 0 8485 respectively compared with the monitored co2 fluxes similarly case 2 revealed cumulative co2 fluxes of 42 4 cm3 cm 2 with nrmse of 0 124 cm3 cm 2 day 1 and r2 of 0 8322 the trend of simulated co2 fluxes in both cases were closely related with the t avg d additionally precipitation events frequently caused drops in co2 fluxes in both cases implying that co2 diffusion through soils was hindered by lack of soil pores with increasing θ soil and thus the increased tortuosity limited co2 diffusion through the soil the limited co2 diffusion resulted in elevated co2 concentration in soil profile when the θ soil increased due to the precipitation events however a degree of elevated co2 concentration at 30 cm depth was different depending on the soil properties for example in case 2 characterized by relatively large θ s and ks co2 concentration purple solid line did not show any significant increase responding to the precipitation events dotted solid line in contrast a relatively large fluctuation of co2 concentration appeared in case 6 green solid line which was characterized by small θs and ks the 1st co2 release test 130 kg co2 release in zone 3 was conducted for 5 days from october 26 to 30 2015 pink box in fig 9 after the 1st co2 release test the measured co2 flux did not show any immediate increase rather it took 6 days until the co2 flux began to increase at the surface the maximum co2 flux recorded during the co2 release test was 0 45 cm3 cm 2 day 1 occurring on november 6 2015 the co2 flux decreased when the precipitation events occurred on november 7 in the same period the simulated co2 reflecting the natural background co2 level was approximately 0 2 cm3 cm 2 day 1 the difference between these two quantities indicates the amount of released co2 approximately 3 06 kg as the total amount of injected co2 during the 1st test was 130 kg the difference between these two quantities was large the reason for such a huge error presumably occurred due to the large precipitation events 27 mm on november 7 2015 which caused the redistribution of co2 within the soil pores in order to improve our prediction the 2nd co2 release tests were conducted 5 3 2 temporal variation of soil co2 flux and co2 concentration 2nd and 3rd co2 release test fig 10 shows additional high resolution co2 flux data monitored from june 1 2016 to february 22 2017 267 days including the periods for the 2nd and 3rd co2 release tests pink shaded area in the 2nd co2 release test co2 was released from june 1 to 30 2016 30 days compared to the 1st co2 release test the co2 release rate in the 2nd test was half but the amount of released co2 was 6 times greater table 1 during the 2nd test the surface co2 flux increased after 3 days of co2 release however co2 flux during the 1st test which was conducted with higher co2 release rate did not increase as early as one during the 2nd test unlike the 2nd test which had no major precipitation events a couple of precipitation events 16 mm occurred on october 27 2015 1 day after the 1st co2 release test began despite a high releasing rate of co2 in the 1st release test co2 flux slowly responded because increased soil moistures due to precipitations prevented co2 rise through pores the drop in co2 flux down to zero was again observed immediately after the multiple precipitation events july 1 16 29 august 31 and september 17 2016 for example after multiple precipitation events 250 mm from july 1 to 5 2016 the measured co2 flux decreased rapidly to almost zero after the rain stopped on july 6 2016 the co2 flux increased back to 2 0 cm3 cm 2 day 1 implying diffusive co2 transport from the 2nd release test approximately 1 6 to 2 0 cm3 cm 2 day 1 of co2 fluxes were maintained until august 28 2016 except for the rainy days section d in fig 10 the simulated case 2 and 6 representing the natural co2 fluxes were fairly similar each other but because of differences in soil hydraulic properties a degree of reduction in co2 flux due to precipitation events was a slightly higher in case 6 than in case 2 the calculated co2 mass between the measured and simulated co2 fluxes was approximately 300 kg during june 1 30 2016 the total amount of released co2 during the 2nd experiment was 458 kg table 1 and approximately 2 3 of the released co2 was able to be captured during the 2nd co2 release test this estimate was more accurate than that from the 1st co2 release test which was affected by precipitation events finally from october 3 to 7 2016 5 days the 3rd co2 release test was conducted the co2 flux was only measured immediately after the end of the co2 release test therefore the fitting of simulated co2 fluxes with measured ones could not be conducted during the 3rd test the maximum co2 flux recorded during the 3rd test was 0 71 cm3 cm 2 on october 15 2016 which later returned to the background level on october 25 2016 6 conclusion the study examined the relationship between naturally occurring soil co2 flux and meteorological factors and then simulated the natural co2 flux at the eit site using the hydrus soilco2 model at the eit site co2 concentration and fluxes were monitored from august 1 2015 to march 21 2018 965 days influencing environmental factors such as meteorological data soil moisture and soil temperature at 5 different depths were monitored concurrently throughout the field observation it was revealed that the soil moisture content decreased rapidly when the soil temperature dropped below 0 c during the winter season in addition both surface co2 flux and soil co2 concentration increased with a time lag after co2 was released interestingly co2 flux decreased to almost 0 cm3 cm2 day 1 when the precipitation events were occurred in order to evaluate the relationship between meteorological factors atmospheric temperature air pressure wind speed and precipitation and co2 flux their correlations were evaluated supplement fig s3 revealing that the co2 flux had a strong positive correlation 0 7526 with the t avg d which is closely related to the growth of soil microorganisms especially a correlation between δd p δ daily precipitation and δco2 flux showed a strong negative correlation 0 7882 such a negative correlation implies that increase in the soil moisture in pores after precipitation events resulted in retardation of gaseous co2 diffusion by increasing tortuosity additional to pearson correlation study monitored seasonal variation in both t soil and θ soil were simulated using the numerical simulator the simulated t soil θ soil and co2 flux in case 6 matched well with the measured t soil r2 0 89 θ soil r2 0 74 and co2 flux r2 0 85 respectively finally the difference between the simulated natural co2 flux and the measured co2 flux during the co2 release test could attribute to the mass of released co2 by analyzing the correlation between meteorological factors and soil co2 the dynamics of diffusive co2 transport could be understood better the soil texture and bulk density were important parameters to simulate soil moisture contents accurately although the hydrus soilco2 model was not able to simulate an artificial co2 release in soil profiles it was still useful to evaluate natural background co2 flux hence could be used to detect abnormal co2 releases it is anticipated that this predictive model could allow early detection of co2 leakage from underground co2 storage sites and contribute systems that can effectively calculate the amount of co2 leakage credit authorship

5133,efficient and accurate prediction of river water quality is challenging due to the complex hydrological and environmental processes affecting their nature the challenge is even bigger in unmonitored watersheds both process and data based approaches are utilized for this purpose with each having its own strengths and weaknesses the development of a hybrid model can potentially give robust solutions in this regard to improve the water quality predictions in unmonitored watersheds we developed a hybrid model by combining a process based watershed model and artificial neural network ann combining these two models helped to optimize the calibration and validation process while accounting for the complex hydrological and water quality processes the developed model was applied to watersheds in the atlanta metropolitan area usa to predict monthly nitrate ammonium and phosphate loads we treated the watersheds as unmonitored and tested the skill of the hybrid model accordingly the hybrid model had good skills in predicting all three constituents the model worked especially well for nitrate as a matter of fact it even outperformed swat models calibrated at each site this work emphasizes the potential benefits of the proposed hybrid modeling framework for the prediction of water quality parameters in unmonitored watersheds keywords water quality prediction hybrid approach swat ann unmonitored watershed 1 introduction water quality management enhances the ecosystem and human health and helps sustain drinking water production ho et al 2019 for these purposes water quality data are needed to identify long term trends regional variability emerging problems etc water quality monitoring and sampling over a continuous time period are costly and time consuming this downside limits datasets to sparse sampling points throughout the year and restricts conducting water resource management studies as well as calibrating and validating water quality models libera and sankarasubramanian 2018 to overcome this limitation towards better water quality management the development of water quality models is an important step different modeling techniques have been developed over the past decades to improve the prediction accuracy of water quality parameters statistical models such as multiple linear regression models herrig et al 2015 and regression trees stidson et al 2012 which have been used for water quality prediction have certain limitations most statistical models assume linear and normally distributed associations among the predictors and response variable ahmed et al 2019 do not incorporate hydrological processes tongal and booij 2018 and their predictions are restricted to gauged watersheds ho et al 2019 on the other hand process based models are powerful tools that can be used to simulate hydrological processes and fate and transport of pollutants under different scenarios however these models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2011 need a large amount of data and processing time ahmed et al 2019 and involve several parameters that cannot be measured abdulmohsin et al 2016 besides these models have a long process of parameter estimation calibration and validation machine learning ml based methods such as artificial neural networks ann are increasingly being used for solving environmental problems these data based methods can tackle highly nonlinear problems abdulmohsin et al 2016 hunter et al 2018 barzegar et al 2016 adnan et al 2019a adnan et al 2019b and do not require knowledge of the physical processes yet often require large volumes of data a number of studies have assessed the prediction accuracy of water quality constituents using ann models haghiabi et al 2018 kalin et al 2010 keshtegar and heddam 2018 khataar et al 2018 sarkar and pandey 2015 šiljić tomić et al 2018 sirisha et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 ann applications have their own challenges such as determining the appropriate network structure which is obtained through experience and trial and error and selecting the best combination of the input variables in addition extrapolation beyond the range of original training data could lead to large errors when the land use cover of watershed changes ml based models can fail to capture the impacts of these dynamics on water quality to develop a more accurate predictive model and account for the limitations of each technique a hybrid approach could work better than a single model rezaeianzadeh et al 2018 tongal and booij 2018 previous studies have shown that coupling different techniques can lead to noticeable improvements in water quantity and quality predictions examples of such hybrid approaches are developing process driven ann and regression models hunter et al 2018 wavelet ann model alizadeh and kavianpour 2015 barzegar et al 2016 machine learning methods coupled with base flow separation rezaeianzadeh et al 2018 tongal and booij 2018 adaptive neuro fuzzy models yaseen and ramal 2018 and ann coupled with scs curve number method isik et al 2013 previous studies have not combined an ml method and a process based watershed model to predict water quality parameters especially in unmonitored watersheds in this study we extend the hybrid approach developed by noori and kalin 2016 for daily streamflow predictions to water quality prediction in unmonitored watersheds in noori and kalin 2016 ann and swat were coupled to overcome the limitations of each model the coupled model resulted in significant improvements in daily streamflow predictions here we illustrate the application of the swat ann approach for water quality prediction and test the model performance by applying it to the data from watersheds in and around the atlanta metropolitan area usa 2 methods 2 1 soil water assessment tool swat swat is a watershed scale semi distributed and continuous time hydrologic and water quality model swat is designed to simulate discharge sediments nutrient and pesticide loads crop growth and management practices over long time periods at daily and sub daily scales neitsch et al 2011 the model divides the watersheds into sub watersheds which are further subdivided into hydrological response units hrus each hru has a unique combination of soil type land use cover and slope swat has been used widely in the field of water resource management for water quantity and quality prediction as well as scenario testing such as effects of land use land cover changes and climate changes on hydrologic cycle bauwe et al 2019 chotpantarat and boonkaewwan 2018 kavian et al 2018 malagó et al 2017 shi et al 2017 wu et al 2017 yan et al 2019 swat simulates the hydrologic cycle in two phases of land and water the land phase controls the amount of water sediment and nutrients loadings into the main channel of each sub watershed and the water phase is defined as the process of routing runoff sediment and nutrients through the stream network to the watershed outlet neitsch et al 2011 nitrogen is simulated by swat in the soil profile taking into consideration five different organic and inorganic pools nitrate no3 and ammonium nh4 are inorganic forms of nitrogen phosphorus is also simulated by swat in the soil by monitoring six different organic and inorganic pools a detailed model description can be found in neitsch et al 2011 for this work we used the swat model developed in the previous study by noori and kalin 2016 in addition to the concentrations and loads of various constituents in the stream segments called reach in swat and watershed outlet swat also provides users partitioning of sources from the sub watersheds the amount of monthly no3 loads transported by surface runoff lateral flow and baseflow to streamflow as well as simulated monthly streamflow at the watershed outlet were used as inputs to the no3 ann model for nh4 swat estimated monthly nh4 loads at the watershed outlet as well as monthly streamflows were used as inputs to the nh4 ann model for phosphate po4 3 swat simulated monthly mineral phosphorus loadings at the watershed outlet and simulated streamflows were used as inputs to the po4 3 ann model 3 study area and data the study area is in the southeast of the united states the state of georgia atlanta atlanta and its metropolitan area have a warm and humid climate with an average annual temperature of 16 5 0c and average annual precipitation of 1200 mm urban development has been very rapid over the past decades in this region and based on the 2006 national land cover data nlcd the dominant land use types are impervious surfaces as well as evergreen deciduous mixed forest the input data to the model include daily air temperature data from the national climatic data center stations in atlanta area and daily precipitation data from the north american land data assimilation system nldas land use cover data from the 2006 national land cover data nlcd and soil data from the soil survey geographic database ssurgo we considered 29 us geological survey usgs monitoring stations nearby the city of atlanta with daily streamflow data as well as water quality data available over the period 2002 2010 the locations of these stations with available water quality data are shown in fig 1 the summary of available data for each station is also given in supplementary material table 1 watersheds ranged in size from 3 to 552 km2 dominant land cover use types in these watersheds are impervious surfaces ranging from 13 to 52 and deciduous forests ranging from 2 to 24 overall 15 stations with no3 data 25 stations with nh4 data and 13 stations with po4 3 data were used in the study no3 concentrations ranged between 0 18 and 13 mg l station 2 203 700 had the highest no3 concentration among 15 stations about two times higher than other stations nh4 concentrations ranged from 0 01 to 10 mg l station 2 334 885 had the highest nh4 concentration station 2 336 240 overall had very low nh4 concentrations which ranged between 0 03 and 0 16 mg l po4 3 concentrations ranged from 0 to 1 32 mg l and station 2 334 480 had the highest concentration among 13 stations this study focused on predicting nutrient loads rather than nutrient concentrations accurate prediction of nutrient loads is important for water bodies too much nitrogen and phosphorous in the water can lead to various problems such as algal blooms not only can some algae produce toxins but also when algae die they can lead to reductions in oxygen levels in the water since the observed water quality concentration data are instantaneous and not in a continuous time scale the load estimator loadest tool developed by usgs runkel et al 2004 was used to generate continuous time series of each constituent loads at each usgs station this tool combines streamflow time series with instantaneous water quality concentrations and uses a set of regression models to estimate mean loads over a specified time interval on a continuous scale daily monthly or seasonal this tool has been used commonly to generate continuous data from discrete data and to estimate monthly or annual loading in swat modeling dagnew et al 2016 lee et al 2018 niraula et al 2013 singh et al 2015 wallace et al 2018 wang et al 2016 the loadest performance r 2 ranged from 0 84 to 0 96 for no3 between 0 53 and 0 95 for nh4 and from 0 46 to 0 83 for po4 3 4 water quality prediction 4 1 coupling swat and ann using the swat models from the previous study noori and kalin 2016 for each station and setting the model parameters at their default values monthly water quality loads were simulated swat generated outputs were then used as inputs to the ann model swat was intentionally not calibrated because our goal was to develop a model that can be used in unmonitored watersheds for each constituent a separate ann model was developed the continuous monthly water quality loads estimated by loadest served as the observed data to train the ann models ann is inspired by the structure of the human brain and has the ability to model complex nonlinear relationships without the detailed knowledge of the internal functions of a system kalin et al 2010 ann is classified based on the number of layers and the direction of information flow feed forward network with levenberg marquardt back propagation learning has been successfully applied to hydrological and environmental problems kalin et al 2010 the feed forward network includes three layers of input hidden and output these layers are connected with each other through neurons input and output layers have neurons equal to the number of inputs and outputs for the hidden layers the optimum number of layers and the number of neurons within hidden layers are usually found through the trial and error approach in this study the tangent sigmoid transfer function was adopted for both hidden and output layers and the sum of square error was minimized as the error function for the model training and testing purposes the leave one site out jackknifing technique was used sefick et al 2015 in this technique one observation is left out of the training data set the model is retrained and the observation that was left out is predicted in this study out of n stations one was left for testing and the model was trained using the remaining n 1 stations data this step was repeated until all stations had been removed once this technique was explained in noori and kalin 2016 in more detail the schematic of the coupled model is given in fig 2 the performances of the models were evaluated with the coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency enash nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percent bias ratio pbias salas et al 2000 the coefficient of determination is a measure of linear correlation between two quantities and is given by r 2 n o i s i o i s i n o i 2 o i 2 n s i 2 s i 2 2 where o and s represent observed data and model outputs and n is the number of data points the nash sutcliff efficiency enash is commonly used to assess the predictive power of hydrological models nash and sutcliffe 1970 it is defined as e nash 1 o i s i 2 o i o 2 where o is the mean of the observed data the percent bias ratio is expressed as p bias 100 s i o i o i the bias ratio measures the degree to which the forecast is under or overpredicted a negative bias ratio indicates underprediction whereas a positive bias ratio reflects overprediction kalin et al 2010 the developed ann models performances were rated using the model evaluation guidelines developed by moriasi et al 2007 for nutrients based on pbias and enash very good 0 75 e nash 1 p bias 25 good 0 65 e nash 0 75 25 p bias 40 satisfactory 0 50 e nash 0 65 40 p bias 70 unsatisfactory e nash 0 50 p bias 70 the architecture of the neural network utilized in this study is shown in fig 3 the proposed feed forward neural network has three main layers input hidden and output layers the input layer has observed streamflow and constituent load obtained from the swat model the hidden layer has multiple neurons the number of neurons in the hidden layer varies with water quality types and sites determination of the optimum number of layers is usually a matter of experimentation a trial and error approach is the most commonly used method to find the number of hidden neurons and layers kalin et al 2010 in this study the number of hidden neurons was searched from 1 to 30 respectively the output layer is the predicted constituent i e nh4 no3 or po4 3 mean square error mse and akaike s information criterion aic are used as selection criteria in determining optimal input and hidden neurons the aic is commonly used in the literature to find optimal ann architectures kalin et al 2010 qi and zhang 2001 various forms of aic are used in the literature we used the one proposed by qi and zhang 2001 aic log σ mle 2 2 m n if n m 1 40 aic log σ mle 2 2 m n m 1 if n m 1 40 where n is the number of data and m is the number of parameters in the model the term σ mle 2 denotes the maximum likelihood estimate of the variance of the residual term or simply the mean square error mse between the observed and simulated data matlab version 9 2 0 2017a was used for ann model simulations to show the advantage of the swat ann model over the traditional ann model we developed ann models similar to ones in kalin et al 2010 for no3 nh4 and po4 3 using lulc streamflow and temperature as input variables again the jackknifing method was used for training and testing the models the performance of the ann model was compared with the hybrid model 5 swat cup to have another level of assessment for the prediction power of the swat ann model we compared the performance of the coupled model with swat by calibrating the swat model for no3 as a check against possible idiosyncrasies of the hybrid approach we did not calibrate the swat model for po4 3 and nh4 considering the main goal which solely was for comparison the swat model was calibrated using the swat calibration uncertainty procedure swat cup abbaspour et al 2007 abbaspour 2015 swat cup is a calibration sensitivity and uncertainty analysis tool for swat in this study the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 module abbaspour et al 2007 was used for model calibration sufi 2 determines the most sensitive parameters for calibration through latin hypercube sampling swat cup was run for each station separately on the monthly time step the number of iterations varied from 3 to 10 each iteration had 500 simulations for the first iteration the parameters that were considered for the daily streamflow calibration in the previous study noori and kalin 2016 were fixed to their best estimated values then the monthly no3 load was added as observed data to swat cup and new set of parameters were added for no3calibration with their default ranges for the next iterations swat cup recommended parameter ranges were used when the swat cup recommended range of a parameter exceeded its min max limit the recommended range was adjusted model performance was evaluated with r 2 enash and pbias 6 results the testing results of swat ann hybrid models are given in fig 4 figs 5 7 compare the observed monthly load time series with the model simulations it is necessary to emphasize one more time that each watershed in these figures was treated as an unmonitored watershed for testing purposes when a watershed was used for testing no data from that watershed was used at all during the training of the swat ann model for the stations with no3 data the training performance rating was very good with enash 0 80 for all the stations supplementary material table 2 for the testing more than 70 of the watersheds had the performance rating of good to very good the median enash and absolute pbias values for no3 runs were 0 77 and 7 respectively if the two sites with very low performances are ignored these values improve to 0 78 and 3 respectively as shown in fig 5 swat ann simulated no3 load successfully captured the observed time series pattern and peaks and troughs for the majority of the 15 stations the hybrid model overestimated the no3 load in stations 2 203 603 and 2 336 313 which have small watershed areas 6 and 4 km2 respectively with impervious surface and urban grass as the dominant land use land cover types the majority of watersheds used for training of the no3 models had area 10 km2 the model did not capture the peak load at the beginning of the time series in station 2 336 517 but captured the observed pattern later in the time series fig 5 plotting the enash values against the watershed characteristics fig 8 a showed that as the watershed size increases the model performance rate increases as well p value 0 003 also as the percent impervious cover increases in these watersheds the model performance rate decreases p value 0 001 on the other hand watersheds with a higher percentage of forest cover had better model performances p value 0 03 we found a correlation between watershed area and level of imperviousness or forest cover in the study region r 0 15 and 0 16 respectively although there is a significant correlation between forest cover and imperviousness r 0 91 therefore the opposite trends between the model performance versus percent impervious cover and the model performance versus watershed size are not related one can speculate that as the imperviousness thus urban land increases the likelihood of having point or any other nutrient sources such as combined sewer overflows cso or leaky sewer systems increases our modeling framework did not consider such sources these results highlight that the developed swat ann model predicts the no3 load in forested watersheds or less urbanized with the area more than 10 km2 in the atlanta metropolitan area with higher accuracy for nh4 the training performance rating was very good with enash 0 75 for 24 out of the 25 stations supplementary material table 2 for the testing 11 out of 25 stations had enash 0 50 and the performance rating was satisfactory to very good with the median enash and absolute pbias values at 0 44 and 15 respectively the swat ann model could not capture the large peaks of the nh4 load for the majority of stations but predicted the small peaks more accurately the models except for stations 2 336 313 and 2203603 also predicted the variations in the data accurately no3 load at these two stations was also overestimated by the hybrid model for some of the stations the model underestimated the observed peak loads and overestimated the troughs fig 6 the majority 88 of watersheds with nh4 data in this study have less than 37 impervious cover median 23 however the watersheds draining to stations 2203603 2336030 and 2 336 313 have an impervious cover of 46 52 and 51 respectively and are the most urbanized watersheds supplementary material table 1 these three stations also have much higher observed concentrations mean is 1 31 mg l than the other stations mean 0 09 mg l therefore with the leave one out jackknifing the trained models are having a hard time predicting nh4 levels at these sites linking the area of land use land cover characteristics of these watersheds with the nh4 model performance rate did not add any strong explanation to the analysis however if we kick out the two watersheds with very low performances then we observe the same trends we observed with no3 fig 8b station 2 217 274 has the smallest watershed area at 3 km2 for the rest median 35 km2 mean 85 km2 for po4 3 the training performance rating was between satisfactory to good with enash 0 55 for all the stations supplementary material table 2 for the testing the developed model of po4 3 load similar to nh4 underestimated the large peaks fig 7 and had the weakest performance ratings with only 4 out of 13 stations with enash value of about 0 50 or higher fig 4c there were no strong associations between either of the watershed area percent imperviousness or forest cover and the model performance rate fig 8c removing the watersheds with very low performances did not change results and no statistically significant associations were found however the percent of pasture cover was significantly related to the hybrid model performance rate p value 0 023 watersheds with higher pasture cover had the lowest enash values this result highlights that the source of phosphorus from the pasture was not accounted for and was not simulated well by the swat model note that we used the default swat parameterization no adjustments were made to any of the swat parameters 7 discussion for comparison purposes we calibrated the swat model using swat cup for monthly no3 loads the swat cup performance rating was unsatisfactory for all 15 stations with no3 data fig 9 the mean enash and absolute pbias values for no3 runs were 0 06 and 6 respectively the testing step of swat cup includes selecting the nearest watershed to the trained watershed and running the swat cup model with the trained model s best estimated parameters however considering the weak performance of swat cup for the training set we chose to skip the testing step comparing the swat cup calibration results with the hybrid model testing results it is clear that the swat ann model outperformed the swat model and coupling swat and ann improved the no3 prediction accuracy we also compared the predictive power of ann models developed using lulc temperature and streamflow as input variables with the hybrid model based on the enash values for no3 the hybrid model outperformed the ann model in 85 of the stations the mean median enash values were 0 50 0 77 and 4 3 0 73 respectively for swat ann and ann for nh4 the hybrid model had a better performance than the ann model in 56 of the stations the mean median enash values were 0 15 0 44 and 1 2 0 48 respectively for swat ann and ann for po4 3 in 77 of the stations swat ann performed better the mean median enash values were 0 14 0 32 and 0 32 0 01 respectively for swat ann and ann based on performance measures this comparison highlights the superiority of the coupled model comparing the results of this study with our previous study noori and kalin 2016 revealed reverse trends between streamflow model performance and watershed characteristics although many of the stations used in this study overlap with the ones in noori and kalin 2016 they are not exactly the same in noori and kalin 2016 there were 29 stations on the other hand in this study we had 25 sites for nh4 only 15 sites for no3 and 13 sites for po4 3 further the objective in noori and kalin 2016 was predicting daily streamflow in this study the focus was on predicting monthly nutrient loads the processes and time scales of the two studies are completely different in addition noori and kalin 2016 had separate models for cool and warm seasons to account for seasonal variations in contribution of baseflow and stormflow to the total flow as well as to account for environmental and vegetation variations considering all these factors it is hard to make a comparison between the two studies the swat ann training performance somewhat mirrors the loadest performance po4 3 model performance is lower than no3 and nh4 models because the phosphorus cycle is more complex it is simulated by swat by monitoring six different organic and inorganic pools in addition some of the phosphorous are transported to the main channels with sediment if we had sediment data po4 predictions would have been likely better both for loadest and swat ann the loadest performance for no3 and nh4 are not too far apart with the former being a little better the reason for the slightly lower performance of nh4 is likely due to the higher variation in nh4 measurements the average coefficient of variation for observed no3 concentrations was 0 38 0 29 0 50 for observed nh4 concentrations it was 1 17 0 45 4 2 the swat ann model performances for no3 and nh4 during training are also close note that there is no training testing sequence with loadest therefore comparing swat ann testing performance to loadest is not meaningful 8 summary and conclusions this work expanded a hybrid modeling framework previously developed for streamflow prediction in ungauged watersheds by noori and kain 2016 to monthly nutrient load prediction in unmonitored watersheds testing of the model for predicting no3 nh4 and po4 3 in the atlanta metropolitan area southeast usa showed that the hybrid model outperformed standalone swat and ann models the developed hybrid model improved the water quality prediction accuracy by accounting for the hydrology as well as fate and transport of nutrients on land and streams through incorporation of the swat model into ann if reliable water quality data is available a calibrated and validated swat model can be a robust tool for assessing the impacts of land use change climate change variability or any management operations in a watershed if water quality data is not available then swat is typically calibrated and validated at a nearby watershed with similar characteristics and the model parameters are transferred from the donor watershed to the target watershed wang and kalin 2011 the hybrid model developed in this study eliminates the need for parameter transferring in our study the hybrid model had better skills in predicting nutrient loads than the swat model calibrated at each individual site a comparison of the hybrid model to the ann model showed that the prediction accuracy of the hybrid model was higher for the majority of watersheds for all three nutrients the input variables to the ann model were lulc percentages temperature and streamflow in the hybrid model lulc and temperature were replaced with swat simulated nutrient loads which helped us better represent the hydrological and water quality processes swat captures effects of lulc on hydrology through various processes such as canopy interception evapotranspiration et plant growth runoff generation and infiltration cn varies by lulc in the scs cn method and overland flow routing through manning s roughness similarly swat simulates movements of nutrients from land to the stream network and calculates the nutrient loadings for each hru in the watershed which increases the accuracy of the loading prediction from the watershed swat also accounts for the loadings from point sources such as the wastewater treatment plant and atmospheric deposition best management practices bmps implemented for nutrient and sediment load reduction can easily be represented in the swat model capturing such detailed information is not possible with ann the hybrid model developed for monthly no3 load outperformed nh4 and po4 3 hybrid models substantially this could be due to including the swat simulated lateral flow surface flow and groundwater no3 contributions to streamflow as inputs to the ann model overall the hybrid model could capture the observed variations in all three nutrients load however it underestimated the large peaks of nh4 and po4 3 data the results of this study highlight the potential benefits of the proposed framework for water quality components prediction the hybrid model can be considered as a regionalized approach in an area with unmonitored watersheds where there are water quality and flow data available in neighboring watersheds with similar landscape characteristics application of our hybrid model in such regions leads to optimization of the water quality monitoring by lowering the cost and process time last but not least although the developed hybrid models can be reliably implemented in watersheds with similar characteristics in and near the atlanta metropolitan area the methodology is universal and can be developed in any other region in the world with low landscape heterogeneity since extrapolation beyond the range of original training data would lower the model accuracy similar hybrid models can be developed using other watershed models such as hspf swmm mike she etc and machine learning techniques random forest gradient boosting machine extreme learning machine m5 cubist elastic net etc the idea of coupling process based models and machine learning techniques with the goal of optimizing the computational process and increasing the prediction accuracy

5133,efficient and accurate prediction of river water quality is challenging due to the complex hydrological and environmental processes affecting their nature the challenge is even bigger in unmonitored watersheds both process and data based approaches are utilized for this purpose with each having its own strengths and weaknesses the development of a hybrid model can potentially give robust solutions in this regard to improve the water quality predictions in unmonitored watersheds we developed a hybrid model by combining a process based watershed model and artificial neural network ann combining these two models helped to optimize the calibration and validation process while accounting for the complex hydrological and water quality processes the developed model was applied to watersheds in the atlanta metropolitan area usa to predict monthly nitrate ammonium and phosphate loads we treated the watersheds as unmonitored and tested the skill of the hybrid model accordingly the hybrid model had good skills in predicting all three constituents the model worked especially well for nitrate as a matter of fact it even outperformed swat models calibrated at each site this work emphasizes the potential benefits of the proposed hybrid modeling framework for the prediction of water quality parameters in unmonitored watersheds keywords water quality prediction hybrid approach swat ann unmonitored watershed 1 introduction water quality management enhances the ecosystem and human health and helps sustain drinking water production ho et al 2019 for these purposes water quality data are needed to identify long term trends regional variability emerging problems etc water quality monitoring and sampling over a continuous time period are costly and time consuming this downside limits datasets to sparse sampling points throughout the year and restricts conducting water resource management studies as well as calibrating and validating water quality models libera and sankarasubramanian 2018 to overcome this limitation towards better water quality management the development of water quality models is an important step different modeling techniques have been developed over the past decades to improve the prediction accuracy of water quality parameters statistical models such as multiple linear regression models herrig et al 2015 and regression trees stidson et al 2012 which have been used for water quality prediction have certain limitations most statistical models assume linear and normally distributed associations among the predictors and response variable ahmed et al 2019 do not incorporate hydrological processes tongal and booij 2018 and their predictions are restricted to gauged watersheds ho et al 2019 on the other hand process based models are powerful tools that can be used to simulate hydrological processes and fate and transport of pollutants under different scenarios however these models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2011 need a large amount of data and processing time ahmed et al 2019 and involve several parameters that cannot be measured abdulmohsin et al 2016 besides these models have a long process of parameter estimation calibration and validation machine learning ml based methods such as artificial neural networks ann are increasingly being used for solving environmental problems these data based methods can tackle highly nonlinear problems abdulmohsin et al 2016 hunter et al 2018 barzegar et al 2016 adnan et al 2019a adnan et al 2019b and do not require knowledge of the physical processes yet often require large volumes of data a number of studies have assessed the prediction accuracy of water quality constituents using ann models haghiabi et al 2018

determining the appropriate network structure which is obtained through experience and trial and error and selecting the best combination of the input variables in addition extrapolation beyond the range of original training data could lead to large errors when the land use cover of watershed changes ml based models can fail to capture the impacts of these dynamics on water quality to develop a more accurate predictive model and account for the limitations of each technique a hybrid approach could work better than a single model rezaeianzadeh et al 2018 tongal and booij 2018 previous studies have shown that coupling different techniques can lead to noticeable improvements in water quantity and quality predictions examples of such hybrid approaches are developing process driven ann and regression models hunter et al 2018 wavelet ann model alizadeh and kavianpour 2015 barzegar et al 2016 machine learning methods coupled with base flow separation rezaeianzadeh et al 2018 tongal and booij 2018 adaptive neuro fuzzy models yaseen and ramal 2018 and ann coupled with scs curve number method isik et al 2013 previous studies have not combined an ml method and a process based watershed model to predict water quality parameters especially in unmonitored watersheds in this study we extend the hybrid approach developed by noori and kalin 2016 for daily streamflow predictions to water quality prediction in unmonitored watersheds in noori and kalin 2016 ann and swat were coupled to overcome the limitations of each model the coupled model resulted in significant improvements in daily streamflow predictions here we illustrate the application of the swat ann approach for water quality prediction and test the model performance by applying it to the data from watersheds in and around the atlanta metropolitan area usa 2 methods 2 1 soil water assessment tool swat swat is a watershed scale semi distributed and continuous time hydrologic and water quality model swat is designed to

into sub watersheds which are further subdivided into hydrological response units hrus each hru has a unique combination of soil type land use cover and slope swat has been used widely in the field of water resource management for water quantity and quality prediction as well as scenario testing such as effects of land use land cover changes and climate changes on hydrologic cycle bauwe et al 2019 chotpantarat and boonkaewwan 2018 kavian et al 2018 malagó et al 2017 shi et al 2017 wu et al 2017 yan et al 2019 swat simulates the hydrologic cycle in two phases of land and water the land phase controls the amount of water sediment and nutrients loadings into the main channel of each sub watershed and the water phase is defined as the process of routing runoff sediment and nutrients through the stream network to the watershed outlet neitsch et al 2011 nitrogen is simulated by swat in the soil profile taking into consideration five different organic and inorganic pools nitrate no3 and ammonium nh4 are inorganic forms of nitrogen phosphorus is also simulated by swat in the soil by monitoring six different organic and inorganic pools a detailed model description can be found in neitsch et al 2011 for this work we used the swat model developed in the previous study by noori and kalin 2016 in addition to the concentrations and loads of various constituents in the stream segments called reach in swat and watershed outlet swat also provides users partitioning of sources from the sub watersheds the amount of monthly no3 loads transported by surface runoff lateral flow and baseflow to streamflow as well as simulated monthly streamflow at the watershed outlet were used as inputs to the no3 ann model for nh4 swat estimated monthly nh4 loads at the watershed outlet as well as monthly streamflows were used as inputs to the nh4 ann model for phosphate po4 3 swat simulated monthly mineral phosphorus loadings at the watershed outlet and simulated streamflows were used as inputs to the po4 3 ann model 3 study area and data the study area is in the southeast of the united states the state of georgia atlanta atlanta and its metropolitan area have a warm and humid climate with an average annual temperature of 16 5 0c and average annual precipitation of 1200 mm urban development has been very rapid over the past decades in this region and based on the 2006 national land cover data nlcd the dominant land use types are impervious surfaces as well as evergreen deciduous mixed forest the input data to the model include daily air temperature data from the national climatic data center stations in atlanta area and daily precipitation data from the north american land data assimilation system nldas land use cover data from the 2006 national land cover data nlcd and soil data from the soil survey geographic database ssurgo we considered 29 us geological survey usgs monitoring stations nearby the city of atlanta with daily streamflow data as well as water quality data available over the period 2002 2010 the locations of these stations with available water quality data are shown in fig 1 the summary of available data for each station is also given in supplementary material table 1 watersheds ranged in size from 3 to 552 km2 dominant land cover use types in these watersheds are impervious surfaces ranging from 13 to 52 and deciduous forests ranging from 2 to 24 overall 15 stations with no3 data 25 stations with nh4 data and 13 stations with po4 3 data were used in the study no3 concentrations ranged between 0 18 and 13 mg l station 2 203 700 had the highest no3 concentration among 15 stations about two times higher than other stations nh4 concentrations ranged from 0 01 to 10 mg l station 2 334 885 had the highest nh4 concentration station 2 336 240 overall had very low nh4 concentrations which ranged between 0 03 and 0 16 mg l po4 3 concentrations ranged from 0 to 1 32 mg l and station 2 334 480 had the highest concentration among 13 stations this study focused on predicting nutrient loads rather than nutrient concentrations accurate prediction of nutrient loads is important for water bodies too much nitrogen and phosphorous in the water can lead to various problems such as algal blooms not only can some algae produce toxins but also when algae die they can lead to reductions in oxygen levels in the water since the observed water quality concentration data are instantaneous and not in a continuous time scale the load estimator loadest tool developed by usgs runkel et al 2004 was used to generate continuous time series of each constituent loads at each usgs station this tool combines streamflow time series with instantaneous water quality concentrations and uses a set of regression models to estimate mean loads over a specified time interval on a continuous scale daily monthly or seasonal this tool has been used commonly to generate continuous data from discrete data and to estimate monthly or annual loading in swat modeling dagnew et al 2016 lee et al 2018 niraula et al 2013 singh et al 2015 wallace et al 2018 wang et al 2016 the loadest performance r 2 ranged from 0 84 to 0 96 for no3 between 0 53 and 0 95 for nh4 and from 0 46 to 0 83 for po4 3 4 water quality prediction 4 1 coupling swat and ann using the swat models from the previous study noori and kalin 2016 for each station and setting the model parameters at their default values monthly water quality loads were simulated swat generated outputs were then used as inputs to the ann model swat was intentionally not calibrated because our goal was to develop a model that can be used in unmonitored watersheds for each constituent a separate ann model was developed the continuous monthly water quality loads estimated by loadest served as the observed data to train the ann models ann is inspired by the structure of the human brain and has the ability to model complex nonlinear relationships without the detailed knowledge of the internal functions of a system kalin et al 2010 ann is classified based on the number of layers and the direction of information flow feed forward network with levenberg marquardt back propagation learning has been successfully applied to hydrological and environmental problems kalin et al 2010 the feed forward network includes three layers of input hidden and output these layers are connected with each other through neurons input and output layers have neurons equal to the number of inputs and outputs for the hidden layers the optimum number of layers and the number of neurons within hidden layers are usually found through the trial and error approach in this study the tangent sigmoid transfer function was adopted for both hidden and output layers and the sum of square error was minimized as the error function for the model training and testing purposes the leave one site out jackknifing technique was used sefick et al 2015 in this technique one observation is left out of the training data set the model is retrained and the observation that was left out is predicted in this study out of n stations one was left for testing and the model was trained using the remaining n 1 stations data this step was repeated until all stations had been removed once this technique was explained in noori and kalin 2016 in more detail the schematic of the coupled model is given in fig 2 the performances of the models were evaluated with the coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency enash nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percent bias ratio pbias salas et al 2000 the coefficient of determination is a measure of linear correlation between two quantities and is given by r 2 n o i s i o i s i n o i 2 o i 2 n s i 2 s i 2 2 where o and s represent observed data and model outputs and n is the number of data points the nash sutcliff efficiency enash is commonly used to assess the predictive power of hydrological models nash and sutcliffe 1970 it is defined as e nash 1 o i s i 2 o i o 2 where o is the mean of the observed data the percent bias ratio is expressed as p bias 100 s i o i o i the bias ratio measures the degree to which the forecast is under or overpredicted a negative bias ratio indicates underprediction whereas a positive bias ratio reflects overprediction kalin et al 2010 the developed ann models performances were rated using the model evaluation guidelines developed by moriasi et al 2007 for nutrients based on pbias and enash very good 0 75 e nash 1 p bias 25 good 0 65 e nash 0 75 25 p bias 40 satisfactory 0 50 e nash 0 65 40 p bias 70 unsatisfactory e nash 0 50 p bias 70 the architecture of the neural network utilized in this study is shown in fig 3 the proposed feed forward neural network has three main layers input hidden and output layers the input layer has observed streamflow and constituent load obtained from the swat model the hidden layer has multiple neurons the number of neurons in the hidden layer varies with water quality types and sites determination of the optimum number of layers is usually a matter of experimentation a trial and error approach is the most commonly used method to find the number of hidden neurons and layers kalin et al 2010 in this study the number of hidden neurons was searched from 1 to 30 respectively the output layer is the predicted constituent i e nh4 no3 or po4 3 mean square error mse and akaike s information criterion aic are used as selection criteria in determining optimal input and hidden neurons the aic is commonly used in the literature to find optimal ann architectures kalin et al 2010 qi and zhang 2001 various forms of aic are used in the literature we used the one proposed by qi and zhang 2001 aic log σ mle 2 2 m n if n m 1 40 aic log σ mle 2 2 m n m 1 if n m 1 40 where n is the number of data and m is the number of parameters in the model the term σ mle 2 denotes the maximum likelihood estimate of the variance of the residual term or simply the mean square error mse between the observed and simulated data matlab version 9 2 0 2017a was used for ann model simulations to show the advantage of the swat ann model over the traditional ann model we developed ann models similar to ones in kalin et al 2010 for no3 nh4 and po4 3 using lulc streamflow and temperature as input variables again the jackknifing method was used for training and testing the models the performance of the ann model was compared with the hybrid model 5 swat cup to have another level of assessment for the prediction power of the swat ann model we compared the performance of the coupled model with swat by calibrating the swat model for no3 as a check against possible idiosyncrasies of the hybrid approach we did not calibrate the swat model for po4 3 and nh4 considering the main goal which solely was for comparison the swat model was calibrated using the swat calibration uncertainty procedure swat cup abbaspour et al 2007 abbaspour 2015 swat cup is a calibration sensitivity and uncertainty analysis tool for swat in this study the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 module abbaspour et al 2007 was used for model calibration sufi 2 determines the most sensitive parameters for calibration through latin hypercube sampling swat cup was run for each station separately on the monthly time step the number of iterations varied from 3 to 10 each iteration had 500 simulations for the first iteration the parameters that were considered for the daily streamflow calibration in the previous study noori and kalin 2016 were fixed to their best estimated values then the monthly no3 load was added as observed data to swat cup and new set of parameters were added for no3calibration with their default ranges for the next iterations swat cup recommended parameter ranges were used when the swat cup recommended range of a parameter exceeded its min max limit the recommended range was adjusted model performance was evaluated with r 2 enash and pbias 6 results the testing results of swat ann hybrid models are given in fig 4 figs 5 7 compare the observed monthly load time series with the model simulations it is necessary to emphasize one more time that each watershed in these figures was treated as an unmonitored watershed for testing purposes when a watershed was used for testing no data from that watershed was used at all during the training of the swat ann model for the stations with no3 data the training performance rating was very good with enash 0 80 for all the stations supplementary material table 2 for the testing more than 70 of the watersheds had the performance rating of good to very good the median enash and absolute pbias values for no3 runs were 0 77 and 7 respectively if the two sites with very low performances are ignored these values improve to 0 78 and 3 respectively as shown in fig 5 swat ann simulated no3 load successfully captured the observed time series pattern and peaks and troughs for the majority of the 15 stations the hybrid model overestimated the no3 load in stations 2 203 603 and 2 336 313 which have small watershed areas 6 and 4 km2 respectively with impervious surface and urban grass as the dominant land use land cover types the majority of watersheds used for training of the no3 models had area 10 km2 the model did not capture the peak load at the beginning of the time series in station 2 336 517 but captured the observed pattern later in the time series fig 5 plotting the enash values against the watershed characteristics fig 8 a showed that as the watershed size increases the model performance rate increases as well p value 0 003 also as the percent impervious cover increases in these watersheds the model performance rate decreases p value 0 001 on the other hand watersheds with a higher percentage of forest cover had better model performances p value 0 03 we found a correlation between watershed area and level of imperviousness or forest cover in the study region r 0 15 and 0 16 respectively although there is a significant correlation between forest cover and imperviousness r 0 91 therefore the opposite trends between the model performance versus percent impervious cover and the model performance versus watershed size are not related one can speculate that as the imperviousness thus urban land increases the likelihood of having point or any other nutrient sources such as combined sewer overflows cso or leaky sewer systems increases our modeling framework did not consider such sources these results highlight that the developed swat ann model predicts the no3 load in forested watersheds or less urbanized with the area more than 10 km2 in the atlanta metropolitan area with higher accuracy for nh4 the training performance rating was very good with enash 0 75 for 24 out of the 25 stations supplementary material table 2 for the testing 11 out of 25 stations had enash 0 50 and the performance rating was satisfactory to very good with the median enash and absolute pbias values at 0 44 and 15 respectively the swat ann model could not capture the large peaks of the nh4 load for the majority of stations but predicted the small peaks more accurately the models except for stations 2 336 313 and 2203603 also predicted the variations in the data accurately no3 load at these two stations was also overestimated by the hybrid model for some of the stations the model underestimated the observed peak loads and overestimated the troughs fig 6 the majority 88 of watersheds with nh4 data in this study have less than 37 impervious cover median 23 however the watersheds draining to stations 2203603 2336030 and 2 336 313 have an impervious cover of 46 52 and 51 respectively and are the most urbanized watersheds supplementary material table 1 these three stations also have much higher observed concentrations mean is 1 31 mg l than the other stations mean 0 09 mg l therefore with the leave one out jackknifing the trained models are having a hard time predicting nh4 levels at these sites linking the area of land use land cover characteristics of these watersheds with the nh4 model performance rate did not add any strong explanation to the analysis however if we kick out the two watersheds with very low performances then we observe the same trends we observed with no3 fig 8b station 2 217 274 has the smallest watershed area at 3 km2 for the rest median 35 km2 mean 85 km2 for po4 3 the training performance rating was between satisfactory to good with enash 0 55 for all the stations supplementary material table 2 for the testing the developed model of po4 3 load similar to nh4 underestimated the large peaks fig 7 and had the weakest performance ratings with only 4 out of 13 stations with enash value of about 0 50 or higher fig 4c there were no strong associations between either of the watershed area percent imperviousness or forest cover and the model performance rate fig 8c removing the watersheds with very low performances did not change results and no statistically significant associations were found however the percent of pasture cover was significantly related to the hybrid model performance rate p value 0 023 watersheds with higher pasture cover had the lowest enash values this result highlights that the source of phosphorus from the pasture was not accounted for and was not simulated well by the swat model note that we used the default swat parameterization no adjustments were made to any of the swat parameters 7 discussion for comparison purposes we calibrated the swat model using swat cup for monthly no3 loads the swat cup performance rating was unsatisfactory for all 15 stations with no3 data fig 9 the mean enash and absolute pbias values for no3 runs were 0 06 and 6 respectively the testing step of swat cup includes selecting the nearest watershed to the trained watershed and running the swat cup model with the trained model s best estimated parameters however considering the weak performance of swat cup for the training set we chose to skip the testing step comparing the swat cup calibration results with the hybrid model testing results it is clear that the swat ann model outperformed the swat model and coupling swat and ann improved the no3 prediction accuracy we also compared the predictive power of ann models developed using lulc temperature and streamflow as input variables with the hybrid model based on the enash values for no3 the hybrid model outperformed the ann model in 85 of the stations the mean median enash values were 0 50 0 77 and 4 3 0 73 respectively for swat ann and ann for nh4 the hybrid model had a better performance than the ann model in 56 of the stations the mean median enash values were 0 15 0 44 and 1 2 0 48 respectively for swat ann and ann for po4 3 in 77 of the stations swat ann performed better the mean median enash values were 0 14 0 32 and 0 32 0 01 respectively for swat ann and ann based on performance measures this comparison highlights the superiority of the coupled model comparing the results of this study with our previous study noori and kalin 2016 revealed reverse trends between streamflow model performance and watershed characteristics although many of the stations used in this study overlap with the ones in noori and kalin 2016 they are not exactly the same in noori and kalin 2016 there were 29 stations on the other hand in this study we had 25 sites for nh4 only 15 sites for no3 and 13 sites for po4 3 further the objective in noori and kalin 2016 was predicting daily streamflow in this study the focus was on predicting monthly nutrient loads the processes and time scales of the two studies are completely different in addition noori and kalin 2016 had separate models for cool and warm seasons to account for seasonal variations in contribution of baseflow and stormflow to the total flow as well as to account for environmental and vegetation variations considering all these factors it is hard to make a comparison between the two studies the swat ann training performance somewhat mirrors the loadest performance po4 3 model performance is lower than no3 and nh4 models because the phosphorus cycle is more complex it is simulated by swat by monitoring six different organic and inorganic pools in addition some of the phosphorous are transported to the main channels with sediment if we had sediment data po4 predictions would have been likely better both for loadest and swat ann the loadest performance for no3 and nh4 are not too far apart with the former being a little better the reason for the slightly lower performance of nh4 is likely due to the higher variation in nh4 measurements the average coefficient of variation for observed no3 concentrations was 0 38 0 29 0 50 for observed nh4 concentrations it was 1 17 0 45 4 2 the swat ann model performances for no3 and nh4 during training are also close note that there is no training testing sequence with loadest therefore comparing swat ann testing performance to loadest is not meaningful 8 summary and conclusions this work expanded a hybrid modeling framework previously developed for streamflow prediction in ungauged watersheds by noori and kain 2016 to monthly nutrient load prediction in unmonitored watersheds testing of the model for predicting no3 nh4 and po4 3 in the atlanta metropolitan area southeast usa showed that the hybrid model outperformed standalone swat and ann models the developed hybrid model improved the water quality prediction accuracy by accounting for the hydrology as well as fate and transport of nutrients on land and streams through incorporation of the swat model into ann if reliable water quality data is available a calibrated and validated swat model can be a robust tool for assessing the impacts of land use change climate change variability or any management operations in a watershed if water quality data is not available then swat is typically calibrated and validated at a nearby watershed with similar characteristics and the model parameters are transferred from the donor watershed to the target watershed wang and kalin 2011 the hybrid model developed in this study eliminates the need for parameter transferring in our study the hybrid model had better skills in predicting nutrient loads than the swat model calibrated at each individual site a comparison of the hybrid model to the ann model showed that the prediction accuracy of the hybrid model was higher for the majority of watersheds for all three nutrients the input variables to the ann model were lulc percentages temperature and streamflow in the hybrid model lulc and temperature were replaced with swat simulated nutrient loads which helped us better represent the hydrological and water quality processes swat captures effects of lulc on hydrology through various processes such as canopy interception evapotranspiration et plant growth runoff generation and infiltration cn varies by lulc in the scs cn method and overland flow routing through manning s roughness similarly swat simulates movements of nutrients from land to the stream network and calculates the nutrient loadings for each hru in the watershed which increases the accuracy of the loading prediction from the watershed swat also accounts for the loadings from point sources such as the wastewater treatment plant and atmospheric deposition best management practices bmps implemented for nutrient and sediment load reduction can easily be represented in the swat model capturing such detailed information is not possible with ann the hybrid model developed for monthly no3 load outperformed nh4 and po4 3 hybrid models substantially this could be due to including the swat simulated lateral flow surface flow and groundwater no3 contributions to streamflow as inputs to the ann model overall the hybrid model could capture the observed variations in all three nutrients load however it underestimated the large peaks of nh4 and po4 3 data the results of this study highlight the potential benefits of the proposed framework for water quality components prediction the hybrid model can be considered as a regionalized approach in an area with unmonitored watersheds where there are water quality and flow data available in neighboring watersheds with similar landscape characteristics application of our hybrid model in such regions leads to optimization of the water quality monitoring by lowering the cost and process time last but not least although the developed hybrid models can be reliably implemented in watersheds with similar characteristics in and near the atlanta metropolitan area the methodology is universal and can be developed in any other region in the world with low landscape heterogeneity since extrapolation beyond the range of original training data would lower the model accuracy similar hybrid models can be developed using other watershed models such as hspf swmm mike she etc and machine learning techniques random forest gradient boosting machine extreme learning machine m5 cubist elastic net etc the idea of coupling process based models and machine learning techniques with the goal of optimizing the computational process and increasing the prediction accuracy

5134,blue water surface and ground water and green water water stored in unsaturated soil layer and canopy evapotranspiration from rainfall are the two sources of water generated from precipitation and communicating vessels that define the limits of water resources wrs for both human activities and ecosystems however the blue and green evapotranspiration in irrigated fields and their contribution to blue and green water flows have not been identified in studies conducted on blue and green wrs in addition information on intra annual variations in green water footprints wfs and water scarcities is limited in particular there is a lack of information on water consumption obtained from hydrological model based blue and green water assessments at the basin scales this study quantified taking the yellow river basin yrb over 2010 2018 as the study case the inter and intra annual variations in blue and green wrs wfs and water scarcities at sub basin levels wrs and wfs were simulated using the soil and water assessment tool swat model the results revealed that the annual average blue and green wrs of the yrb were 119 33 109 m3 yr 1 and 296 94 109 m3 yr 1 respectively over the study period the blue and green wfs of the crops in the middle reach were significantly larger than those of the crops in the upper and lower reaches there were visible spatial heterogeneities in water scarcities across the basin several areas in the middle reaches were subject to both blue and green water scarcities at least modest level for a minimum of three months a year furthermore the norther region of the yrb was subject to significant and severe blue water scarcity for the whole year keywords blue water green water water resources water footprints water scarcities spatial temporal variations 1 introduction growing water requirements to grow food supply industry and sustain urban and rural populations has led to an increasing shortage of fresh water in many parts of the world oki and kanae 2006 hoekstra et al 2012 vörösmarty et al 2015 green water is defined as the water kept in the unsaturated soil layer and precipitation which is eventually transferred into canopy evapotranspiration falkenmark and rockström 2006 moreover it contributes significantly more than blue water which is composed of surface water and groundwater to the global water consumption of human beings especially for agricultural products 87 liu and yang 2010 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 siebert and döll 2010 several countries in the world which include the middle east central america southern europe and india are subject to severe blue and green water scarcities schyns et al 2019 blue water has been the only focus in water management and mainstream water assessments although blue and green water are the two sources of water generated from rainfall and communicating vessels which define the limits of water resources wrs for human activities and ecosystems schyns et al 2019 veettil and mishra 2016 abbaspour et al 2015 several studies were published on the simultaneous evaluation of blue and green wrs with respect to basins in europe abbaspour et al 2015 africa schuol et al 2008a b canada kaur et al 2019 and china zang et al 2012 yuan et al 2019a b in these case studies blue water water yield and deep aquifer recharge and green water flows evapotranspiration in addition to green water storage soil moisture were accurately estimated underlying the hydrological model referred to as the soil and water assessment tool swat srinivasan et al 1998 arnold et al 1998 at the basin levels nevertheless in the existing studies on assessing blue and green water flows for large river basins zang et al 2012 zang and liu 2013 rodrigues et al 2014 2015 veettil and mishra 2016 2018 kaur et al 2019 irrigation was totally neglected that all the evapotranspiration across the basin was assumed as green water but this assumption is apparently not suitable for basins with intensive irrigated agriculture water footprint wf represent direct and indirect measurements of water appropriation by human beings hoekstra 2003 blue and green wfs refer to consumption of blue and green wrs respectively hoekstra et al 2011 given that agriculture corresponds to the largest water consumption in most regions in the world many studies were dealing with the quantification of blue and green wfs of growing crops at proper spatial resolutions e g rost et al 2008 liu et al 2009 zhuo et al 2016a b wang et al 2019 muratoglu 2019 kaur et al 2019 zhuo et al 2016a estimated the inter annual variations in the blue and green wfs of twenty two major crops in china from 1978 to 2008 by applying the aquacrop model at the 5 arcmin level and thus demonstrated that average wf per person in china decreased by 23 due to increasing crop yields intra national variations in blue wf in crop production have been mapped at a high spatial resolution for the globe hogeboom et al 2020 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 and large river basins including yellow river basin zhuo et al 2016b 2019 however mapping intra annual variability of crop green wf is still rare what s more most of the wf studies were based on the evaluation of the vertical soil water balances and only a few wf assessments on crop production were related to the local regional hydrological cycle which can be effectively shown by distributed hydrological models although luan et al 2018a b employed the swat model for the calculation of crop wfs at the irrigation district level the temporal scale was limited to annual assessments several indicators of water scarcity especially with respect to blue water scarcity have been developed and widely assessed liu et al 2017 vanham et al 2018 there are water scarcity indicators that provide a comparison between water availability and population such as water shortage falkenmark et al 1989 there are indicators that measure the exceedance of water withdrawal with respect to water demand hanasaki et al 2008 and there are indicators related to the balance between water withdrawal and water availability oki and kanae 2006 moreover several indicators consider the proportion of water requirement to water availability rockström et al 2009 the wf based water scarcity indicator which is ratio of the wf to water availability was introduced by hoekstra et al 2012 the wf based indicator of water scarcity solved limitations of the previous water scarcity indicators with respect to neglecting the return flow during the withdrawal of water for usage with regard to water appropriation liu et al 2017 vanham et al 2018 in addition it provides a consistent approach about simultaneous evaluation of blue and green water scarcities in specific regions which was successfully applied to the savannah river basin veettil and mishra 2016 in most cases water scarcity issues for large basins are defined by spatial and temporal mismatch between water consumption and provision within a year even though the total amount of water resources is abundant for the whole basin oki and kanae 2006 apparently comprehensive evaluation and hotpot identification of blue and green wrs water consumptions and water scarcities with respect to location time and frequency are therefore crucial for the sustainable water management and better water allocation at basin level the aim of this study was taking the study case for the yellow river basin yrb over 2010 2018 and the quantification of the inter and intra annual variations in the blue and green wrs wfs and water scarcities at the large river basin and sub basin levels twelve types of major crops were considered which accounted for 88 of the harvested area in nine provinces across the yrb in 2018 nbsc 2019 compared with the previously mentioned studies there are two improvements in the current study first the effect of irrigation on blue and green wrs was considered second with reference to the literature this study quantifies intra annual variations in not only blue wfs but also green wfs related to crop production at a basin level in addition to our knowledge the swat model is applied for the first time for mapping monthly blue and green wfs at croplands 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yellow river yr is the second longest river in china and the fifth longest river in the world covering an area of 795000 km2 fig 1 the yr which is 5464 km originates from the bayan kara mountain in qinghai province of china and flows through nine provinces namely shaanxi henan shandong inner mongolia sichuan gansu shanxi ningxia and qinghai thereafter it eventually flows through shandong to bohai sea it is divided into the upper middle and lower reaches the dividing point of the upper and middle reaches of the yr is in hekou near wanjiazhai and the dividing point of the middle and lower reaches is in taohuayu near huayuankou zhang et al 2008 the northwest region of the yrb is an arid and semi arid region and the southeast region is a semi humid region fig 2 the annual average precipitation from 2000 to 2018 ranged from 200 to 800 mm the east west gradient of annual average temperature was found to be significantly larger than that of the north south gradient moreover it was found to be warmer from the west to east direction which can be mainly attributed to the monsoon climate of the ocean li et al 2016 the yrb consists of six land use types in 2015 grasslands accounted for 46 2 cultivated land accounted for 26 6 forest lands accounted for 13 6 towns accounted for 3 1 water bodies accounted for 1 7 and the remaining land was barren fig 3 2 2 swat model setup here the swat model was used to simulate the water cycle in the yrb from 2010 to 2018 with the pre heating period from 2008 to 2009 calibration period from 2010 to 2014 and validation period from 2015 to 2018 the feasibility of using swat model in simulation of water cycle in the yrb have been shown by li et al 2016 and tang et al 2013 in the current study the simulation time was based on a monthly scale the yrb was split into 35 sub basins including1889 hydrological response units hrus in the swat model the soil conservation services curve number scs cn method mishra and singh 2013 was employed for the simulation of runoff the penman monteith method eagleman 1967 was used to simulate potential evapotranspiration neitsch et al 2011 moreover the swat model requires the basic data sets of elevation meteorology soil and land use table 1 presents the description resolution and sources of the data used in this study the elevation map was obtained from usgs with an accuracy of 15 arcmin usgs 2009 the soil data was obtained from hwsd with an accuracy of 1 1000000 fao and iiasa 2008 the land use data was provided by the resource and environment data cloud platform with an accuracy of 1000 1000 m cas 2015 the data on daily weather was obtained from the national meteorological information center and 120 meteorological stations in the yrb were used nmic 2019 in addition the data of five important reservoirs from the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc 2008 2018 were added to increase the accuracy of the swat with respect to the simulation of the water cycle yrcc 2019 after the simulation the measurements on actual runoff by five hydrological stations along the main stream of yellow river yrcc 2019 were used for calibration and validation in addition to the suif 2 algorithm in swat cup abbaspour et al 2004 the calibration parameters consisted of 26 parameters related to water volume as shown in table 2 five hydrological stations were selected for calibration as they covered the upper middle and lower reaches of the yrb and can therefore suitably represent the flow of wr through the entire yrb zhang et al 2008 table 3 presents calibration and validation results the coefficient of determination r2 was greater than 0 6 the nash sutcliffe efficiency ens was greater than 0 5 and the percentage of bias pbias was less than 25 which indicates that the model yielded good simulation results moriasi et al 2007 bugaets et al 2019 fig s1 and table 3 reveal that the calibration and validation results of the runoff stations were sufficient the swat model is therefore suitable for the simulation of the yrb as the study input the data of the crop module were inputted into the swat model the growth periods of the 12 types of crops in the yrb were set in reference to zhuo et al 2016b and automatic irrigation was selected as the irrigation mode after the simulation the output data 2010 2018 of the national data network http www stats gov cn were used to check the miraca2000 yield distribution map portmann et al 2010 the yield distribution map of the yrb during the research period was then obtained thereafter the crop yield statistics at the provincial level in the basin nbsc 2019 were used to calibrate the crop yield outputs in the swat model 2 3 estimating blue and green water resources the blue wr rb mm of each sub basin indicates the blue water flow fb mm and it consists of the water yield wyld mm and the storage of groundwater δgw mm schuol et al 2008b rodrigues et al 2014 in addition to the actual evapotranspiration from irrigation water etb mm which can be kept in unsaturated soil and absorbed by plants and is then returned to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration moreover wyld represents the water flowing from the hru to the main channel and δgw represents the water entering the aquifer gw rchg mm minus the water entering the main channel from the aquifer gw q mm kaur et al 2019 in the yrb agriculture is well developed and there are many irrigation areas irrigation leads to crop evapotranspiration which contains a portion of blue wrs it is therefore essential to improve the calculation method of blue water in the study 1 f b w y l d g w r c h g g w q n o i r r i g a t i o n f

added based on the crop evapotranspiration et 3 c w u g p e t t i where cwu mm represents the water consumption et mm is the crop evapotranspiration t means time i means crop type and gp is the growth period of the crops the calculation method of the wf per unit yield of 12 types of crops in the yrb is as follows 4 w f g 10 i 1 m t 1 n e t g i t y i w f b 10 i 1 m t 1 n e t b i t y i where wfg and wfb m3 t 1 are the green and blue wfs of the crops etg t i and etb t i mm represent the actual evapotranspiration of hrui on day t of the crop growth period yi t ha 1 is the crop yield per unit area of hrui and the coefficient of 10 is for the conversion of mm into m3 ha 1 the blue and green wfs in the growth period of crops can be calculated using the following soil water balance formula zhuo et

precipitation irr mm is the irrigation water consumption et mm is the actual evapotranspiration ro mm is the surface runoff dp mm denotes the infiltration and side flow through the bottom of the soil profile and loss mm denotes the water lost in the hydrological cycle the industrial and domestic wfs were all considered as blue wfs the industrial and domestic blue water intakes of each province from 2010 to 2018 were obtained from the national data http data stats gov cn and the population density distribution map of the yrb obtained from resource and environment data cloud platform http www resdc cn was then used to calculate the industrial and domestic blue wfs of the yrb the evaporation of the water surface of the reservoirs leads to the generation of the blue wf zhuo et al 2019 from the output results of the swat model the evaporation of the water surface blue wf of the reservoir was determined 2 5 estimating blue and green scarcities the blue water scarcity was measured as the ratio of the blue wf to the available blue wr moreover the blue wf can be divided into the crop blue wf industrial blue wf domestic blue wf and reservoir blue wf 6 b w s b w f b w a where bws is the blue water scarcity bwf m3 is the blue wf and bwa m3 is the available blue wr the available blue wr is the total blue wr minus the environmental flow used to maintain the environment in this study the presumptive standard method was used to calculate the environmental flow richter et al 2012 the environmental flow accounted for 80 of the total runoff and the remaining 20 of the runoff was considered as the available blue wrs for agriculture industry and domestic 7 efr 0 8 q b w a q e f r where bwa is the available blue wr q is the natural runoff and efr is the environmental flow the evaluation of blue water scarcity was conducted as follows hoekstra et al 2012 bws 1 low blue water scarcity bws 1 1 5 moderate blue water scarcity bws 1 5 2 significant blue water scarcity bws greater than 2 severe blue water scarcity the green water scarcity is the ratio of green wf to the available green wr in particular the green wf includes the crop wf and it denotes the amount of green wr that are absorbed and utilized by all vegetation in the basin 8 g w s g w f g w a where gws is the green water scarcity gwf m3 is the green wf and gwa x t m3 is the available green wr the available green wr is used to maintain the growth of plants which is the initial soil water content in the first day of study period namely sw0 of the swat output veettil and mishra 2018 kaur et al 2019 moreover sw0 is the water content of the soil above the plant wilt coefficient which can be used by plants deliberty and legates 2003 it is an absolute measure of green water provision schyns et al 2015 the methodology has been widely accepted and used rodrigues et al 2014 2015 veettil and mishra 2016 2018 kaur et al 2019 by comparing the green water consumption i e the green water footprint to the absolute green water availability i e the initial soil moisture we can measure the degree to which the available green water resources in a geographical area have been appropriated schyns et al 2015 if the green water scarcity was larger than 0 5 it means there is competition over limited green water resources the green water depletion larger than half of the initial soil moisture could be met by possible additional precipitation however increasing proportion of the precipitation would be used for compensate the soil moisture and much less possibility would be for generate the due blue water resources according to the actual case of green water scarcity in the yrb the green water scarcity was evaluated as follows gws 0 5 low green water scarcity gws 0 5 1 moderate green water scarcity gws 1 1 5 significant green water scarcity gws 1 5 severe green water scarcity 3 results 3 1 blue and green wrs fig 4 shows the trends of the blue and green wrs in the yrb with respect to time at the annual and monthly scales from 2010 to 2018 the annual average blue wr was 119 33 109 m3 yr 1 which accounted for 28 7 of the annual average total wrs and the annual average green wr was 296 94 109 m3 yr 1 which accounted for 71 3 of the annual average total wrs the precipitation in 2015 which was the dry year was minimum whereas in 2018 which was the wet year it was maximum moreover the precipitation in 2011 which was the year subject to normal precipitation was at the average level the trends of the blue and green wrs with respect to time were relatively similar to that of precipitation which indicates that precipitation is closely related to the amount of blue and green wrs with an increase in precipitation a portion of the rainwater seeps into the soil to form more green wr and a portion of the rainwater forms surface runoff and subsurface flow into the river thus increasing the amount of blue wr therefore precipitation can affect the amount of blue and green wrs at the monthly scale the wet months ranged from july to september and the dry months ranged from december to february the total quantity of green water flow was larger than that of blue water flow each year especially in the wet months however in the dry months the blue water flow was more than the green water flow due to the lower precipitation less soil moisture and less green water flow in the dry month in addition to the base flow in the runoff the blue water flow in the dry month was more than green water flow the effect of precipitation on the changes in green water flow was significantly greater than that on blue water flow hence the green water flow and precipitation are closely related the total blue and green wrs in most regions ranged from 300 to 900 mm besides the total blue and green wrs increased from the upper reaches to the lower reaches first the precipitation increased from the northwest to southeast directions which resulted in an increase in the soil green water content green water second the population in the lower reach was relatively concentrated and the agriculture was relatively developed hence the natural runoff was not sufficient for human needs and the irrigation of crops consequently there was a greater exploitation of groundwater and a higher water yield which resulted in the highest amount of blue wrs in the lower reach 3 2 blue and green wfs of crops agriculture was found to be relatively well developed in the yrb moreover an extensive estimation of the consumption of blue and green water by the crops allows for a better understanding of the water consumption in the period of crop growth period in addition to the allocation of blue wrs for irrigation fig 5 presents changes in the blue and green wfs of 12 types of crops in the yrb from 2010 to 2018 at the annual and monthly scales the annual average total blue and green wf was 45 16 109 m3 yr 1 in particular the annual average green wf was 40 77 109 m3 yr 1 which accounted for 90 3 of the total wfs and the annual average blue wf was 4 39 109 m3 yr 1 which accounted for 9 7 of the total wfs the blue and green wfs of the crops were concentrated from july to september given that the growth periods of crops in the yrb were concentrated from july to september within the growth periods the crops consumed a significant amount of blue and green water several crop type hrus were under rain fed conditions throughout the year thus they did not require the consumption of blue water when green wr was not sufficient to meet the growth requirements blue wr was used for irrigation hence the blue and green wfs of crops were high from july to september the spatial distribution of crop wfs is helpful in determining the hotspots where water consumption by the crops is most significant the total blue and green wfs in the middle reach were significantly larger than those in the upper and lower reaches given that there were more crops in the middle reaches of the yrb with respect to the blue wf the irrigation areas such as the hetao irrigation area consumed a significant amount of blue water and generated a significant blue wf this was also due to the concentration of crop distribution and the small amount of precipitation in several sub basins the blue wf of the crops was 0 which indicates that the crops in the sub basin were subject to rain fed conditions and did not require the consumption of blue water table 4 reveals the water consumption level per unit yield of the 12 types of crops in the yrb in three typical years it was higher than 1000 m3 t 1 for millet soybean and cotton whereas it was lower than 100 m3 t 1 for vegetables when the wr is limited or economic value is prioritized the results can serve as a reference for the improvement of the planting structure the table also presents the percentage of the blue wf of the 12 crops maize exhibited the highest blue wf proportion which was 41 1 in 2011 whereas most crops exhibited a low percentage of 5 or less in the main growth period of maize lower precipitation leads to the irrigation for maize in general most crops such as cotton and rice grow in the rainy season and their requirement for water can be provided by rainfall 3 3 blue and green water scarcities blue water scarcity is the ratio of blue wf to available blue wr moreover it is helpful to plan the storage and allocation of blue wr by clarifying the blue water scarcity in time and space the blue scarcity ranged from 0 5 to 1 thus the yrb was in a state of low blue water scarcity furthermore the blue water scarcity in 2015 dry year was the highest with a maximum of 0 79 whereas the blue water scarcity in 2018 wet year was the lowest with a maximum of 0 48 the amount of blue wrs is closely related to the water yield and the water yield in the wet year was relatively high this resulted in a significant amount of blue water production and available blue wrs in the yrb thus the scarcity of blue water in the wet year was relatively low fig 6 presents the change trend of the blue wf and available blue and green wrs from 2010 to 2018 the peak periods of the available blue wr and blue wf were not the same moreover the peak period of available blue wr was from july to september and the peak period of blue wf was from june to july first the precipitation was concentrated from july to september thereby resulting in a large runoff in the yrb thereafter there was more available blue wr second the crop growth period was concentrated from june to july which resulted in a significant consumption of blue water thus there was a higher crop blue wf and a greater total amount of blue wf the available blue wr was generally larger than the blue wf and the monthly blue water scarcity mostly ranged from 0 5 to 1 which corresponds to a low blue water scarcity in a few months the blue water scarcity was greater than 1 and a moderate blue water scarcity was reached fig 7 presents the maps of the blue water scarcity in the wettest and driest months of three typical years most regions were subject to low blue water scarcity and the moderate significant and severe blue water scarcities were mostly concentrated in the upper reaches especially the northern region this was because the northern region was subject to less precipitation and it contained large irrigation regions wherein a significant amount of blue water consumption was required moreover the lower reaches were subject to different degrees of blue water scarcity although there was significant precipitation in the lower reaches and the available blue wr was abundant the population density was large and the crop distribution was concentrated this resulted in large domestic and industrial wfs in addition to a significantly large crop blue wf the total blue wf in the lower reaches was greater than the available blue wr thus resulting in a relatively high blue water scarcity in addition fig 7 reveals that in the three typical years the blue water scarcity in the wet months was higher than that in the dry months this is because the blue wf of the crops was significantly larger in the wet months than in the dry months the green water scarcity for the whole yrb ranged from 0 3 to 0 4 which represents a low green water scarcity fig 6 reveals that the available green wr was generally higher than the green wf and only a very few months underwent a green water scarcity greater than 1 the peak values of the green wf were concentrated in the growth period of the crops from june to august in addition the peak values of the available green wr were concentrated in the flood months from july to september fig 8 presents the green water scarcities across sub basins in the wettest and driest months of the three typical years in the dry month in general the green water scarcity was low in the entire basin given that the month was not during the growth period of crop concentration in the wet months the green water scarcity was relatively high in the source region of the upper yrb in the period of concentrated growth period due to the soil water content the available green water content of the soil was very low thus the green water scarcity was high in the middle and lower reaches of the region there were also regions with significant and severe green water scarcity which was due to the large number of irrigation areas and intensive distribution of crops this resulted in an excessive green wf and the green water scarcity according to the spatial and temporal variations of blue and green water scarcities see fig s3 several areas in the middle reaches of the yrb were subject to both blue and green water scarcities at least moderate level for a minimum of three months each year 4 discussion in this study the evolutions of the blue and green wrs wfs and water scarcities in time and space in the yrb from 2010 to 2018 were evaluated the values of several variable were from the output of the swat model which included the et water yield soil water content and underground water content therefore the accuracy of the results was significantly dependent on the accuracy of the model simulation moreover the findings of this study suggest that the quality of the land use map and elevation map can be improved the output of the swat model simulation can be presented more accurately in this study the change of land use was not considered which was a limitation and the land use map of 2015 was employed therefore in future research the impact of land use change will be considered in the sub land use classification of swat the allowable number of classification types was limited by the model moreover given that water consumption process of all crops in the yrb could not be simultaneously simulated in this study only 12 types of crops were considered for the simulation furthermore the land use classification module of the swat model should be improved and the number of sub land use classification types should be increased thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of the water consumption of all types of crops to better simulate the runoff the reservoir module was set up and the longyangxia liujiaxia wanjiazhai xiaolangdi and sanmenxia reservoirs were added which are the critical in the yrb and play a major role in regulating the runoff after the runoff simulation five hydrological stations such as tangnaihai on the main stream of the yrb were selected for calibration as suggested more reservoirs and hydrological stations should be considered in the future research to better simulate the actual case in this study when quantifying the amount of blue and green wrs the impact of irrigation on the amount of blue and green wrs was considered and the consumption of blue water and green water in et was distinguished in existing researches abbaspour et al 2015 kaur et al 2019 the blue wr was considered as the addition of the water yield and the storage of the underground water and the green wr was considered as the addition of the evaporation and the initial soil water content results of this study show that the evaporation was not completely transformed by the absorption of green water however a portion of the evaporation was transformed by the absorption of blue water this is because farmland irrigation requires the consumption of blue water wherein a portion enters the soil and is absorbed and utilized by plants thereafter it is lost via evaporation therefore in this study the improved method based on the soil balance formula zhuo et al 2016b hoekstra 2019 was employed for the calculation of the amount of evaporation caused by blue and green water therefore this study further improved the assessment method of blue and green wrs the blue wr represents the addition of the water yield the storage of groundwater and the evaporation due to blue water consumption the green wr represents the addition of the evaporation due to green water consumption and the initial soil water content zhang et al 2014 calculated the blue and green wrs in the source region of the yrb above tangnaihai station from 1960 to 2000 the blue wr in 2000 amounted to 181 mm and the green wr amounted to 448 mm xu 2013 calculated the green wr in several regions in the middle reaches of the yr the drainage region from hekou to longmen from 1950 to 2007 which amounted to 400 500 mm the current results are consist with above existing records see fig s1 when quantifying the wf blue and green wfs of crops were considered in addition to the wf per yield which indicates the water consumption level per yield of the crops in table 5 the wf per yield obtained in this study was compared with those of other studies yin et al 2019 evaluated the wfs of 12 types of crops in the yrb in 2017 and obtained similar results mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 in addition to zhuo et al 2016b studied and compared the blue and green wfs of related crops from 1996 to 2005 in the yrb compared with the results of the previously mentioned studies the wf per unit yield of most crops in this study were smaller given that the yield per area of crops increased each year thus resulting in a relatively lower water consumption per yield when quantifying the blue water scarcity a coefficient of 0 8 was used to express the proportion of environmental flow in the blue wrs after the calculation the proportions of 0 37 cai et al 2011 and 0 55 yang et al 2009 were used to analyse the sensitivity the number of sub basins above low blue water scarcity of the yrb changed from 20 to 15 0 55 and 10 0 37 the relative changes in the blue water scarcity of each sub basin in the yrb were approximately the same which did not have a significant influence on the determination of the blue water scarcity of each sub basin in the entire yrb zhuo et al 2016b calculated the blue water scarcity of the yrb at monthly scale from 1978 to 2009 and the change trend was consistent with that obtained in this study hoekstra et al 2012 calculated the distribution of blue water scarcity on a global scale from 1996 to 2005 during which the yrb was subject to high blue water scarcity compared with the two abovementioned studies the yrb was in a state of blue water scarcity however the degree of blue water scarcity detected in this study was relatively low this is because in the abovementioned studies the groundwater was not considered when calculating the blue wrs which resulted in a higher blue water scarcity during the study period the yrb was subject to blue and green water scarcities in the upper reaches of the yrb there was a high green water scarcity in the concentrated growth period of the crops due to the low content of green water in the soil the planting of trees in the source region of the yrb the improvement of the soil and the enhancement of the water holding capacity of the soil can alleviate the pressure due to the scarcity of green water from july to september most irrigated areas were subject to both blue and green water scarcities the water loss of the wr transmission and distribution can be reduced by employing various methods for example improving the reservoir regulations in wet months of low water scarcities without intervention on environmental flow requirements zhuo et al 2019 hogeboom et al 2020 more water can thus be available for alleviating the water scarcities in following months meanwhile for irrigated crop lands replacing surface water transmission by water pipe or replacing furrow by drip irrigation are effective measures to decrease wfs moreover farmers can improve the planting structure of crops and plant more crops with a lower water consumption per yield for instance planting more spring wheat rather than winter wheat or planting more sunflower while less cotton there is a large amount of groundwater exploitation in the lower reaches if there is an excessively rapid decrease in the groundwater level the growth of crops and improvement of land are impacted therefore more water should be allocated to the lower reaches to meet the demands of life industry and crop growth 5 conclusions taking the yrb over 2010 2018 as the study case the spatial and intra annual variations in blue and green wrs wfs and water scarcities were simulated the effects of irrigation on blue and green wrs were taken into account for the first time meanwhile the feasibility of the swat model for simulations at large basin scale is further confirmed there are three main findings in the current case for the yrb first green wr was larger than blue wr accounting for 71 3 in total of blue and green wrs at annual average whereas the blue water flow was larger than the green in the dry months second the blue and green wfs of crops in the middle reaches were significantly larger than those in the upper and lower reaches third even though the whole yrb generally showed relatively low blue and green water scarcity in the non crop growth period there were large areas with moderate significant and severe green water scarcity in the upper reaches moreover several areas in the middle reaches were subject to both blue and green water scarcities at least modest level for a minimum of 3 months a year on one hand identification of the hot spots suffering both blue and green water scarcities sounds the alarm for local possible irreversible degradation with water shortages on the other hand understanding both blue and green water demands and endowments helps to make appropriate measures to cope with water scarcities comprehensively apparently the current analysis highlights the importance and necessity to evaluate both blue and green wrs wfs and water scarcities in multiple space and time scales declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

5134,blue water surface and ground water and green water water stored in unsaturated soil layer and canopy evapotranspiration from rainfall are the two sources of water generated from precipitation and communicating vessels that define the limits of water resources wrs for both human activities and ecosystems however the blue and green evapotranspiration in irrigated fields and their contribution to blue and green water flows have not been identified in studies conducted on blue and green wrs in addition information on intra annual variations in green water footprints wfs and water scarcities is limited in particular there is a lack of information on water consumption obtained from hydrological model based blue and green water assessments at the basin scales this study quantified taking the yellow river basin yrb over 2010 2018 as the study case the inter and intra annual variations in blue and green wrs wfs and water scarcities at sub basin levels wrs and wfs were simulated using the soil and water assessment tool swat model the results revealed that the annual average blue and green wrs of the yrb were 119 33 109 m3 yr 1 and 296 94 109 m3 yr 1 respectively over the study period the blue and green wfs of the crops in the middle reach were significantly larger than those of the crops in the upper and lower reaches there were visible spatial heterogeneities in water scarcities across the basin several areas in the middle reaches were subject to both blue and green water scarcities at least modest level for a minimum of three months a year furthermore the norther region of the yrb was subject to significant and severe blue water scarcity for the whole year keywords blue water green water water resources water footprints water scarcities spatial temporal variations 1 introduction growing water requirements to grow food supply industry and sustain urban and rural populations has led to an increasing shortage of fresh water in many parts of the world oki and kanae 2006 hoekstra et al 2012 vörösmarty et al 2015 green water is defined as the water kept in the unsaturated soil layer and precipitation which is eventually transferred into canopy evapotranspiration falkenmark and rockström 2006 moreover it contributes significantly more than blue water which is composed of surface water and groundwater to the global water consumption of human beings especially for agricultural products 87 liu and yang 2010 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 siebert and döll 2010 several countries in the world which include the middle east central america southern europe and india are subject to severe blue and green water scarcities schyns et al 2019 blue water has been the only focus in water management and mainstream water assessments although blue and green water are the two sources of water generated from rainfall and communicating vessels which define the limits of water resources wrs for human activities and ecosystems schyns et al 2019 veettil and mishra 2016 abbaspour et al 2015 several studies were published on the simultaneous evaluation of blue and green wrs with respect to basins in europe abbaspour et al 2015 africa schuol et al 2008a b canada kaur et al 2019 and china zang et al 2012 yuan et al 2019a b in these case studies blue water water yield and deep aquifer recharge and green water flows evapotranspiration in addition to green water storage soil moisture were accurately estimated underlying the hydrological model referred to as the soil and water assessment tool swat srinivasan et al 1998 arnold et al 1998 at the basin levels nevertheless in the existing studies on assessing blue and green water flows for large river basins zang et al 2012 zang and liu 2013 rodrigues et al 2014 2015 veettil and mishra 2016 2018 kaur et al 2019 irrigation was totally neglected that all the evapotranspiration across the basin was assumed as green water but this assumption is apparently not suitable for basins with intensive irrigated agriculture water footprint wf represent direct and indirect measurements of water appropriation by human beings hoekstra 2003 blue and green wfs refer to consumption of blue and green wrs respectively hoekstra et al 2011 given that agriculture corresponds to the largest water consumption in most regions in the world many studies were dealing with the quantification of blue and green wfs of growing crops at proper spatial resolutions e g rost et al 2008 liu et al 2009 zhuo et al 2016a b wang et al 2019 muratoglu 2019 kaur et al 2019 zhuo et al 2016a estimated the inter annual variations in the blue and green wfs of twenty two major crops in china from 1978 to 2008 by applying the aquacrop model at the 5 arcmin level and thus demonstrated that average wf per person in china decreased by 23 due to increasing crop yields intra national variations in blue wf in crop production have been mapped at a high spatial resolution for the globe hogeboom et al 2020 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 and large river basins including yellow river basin zhuo et al 2016b 2019 however mapping intra annual variability of crop green wf is still rare what s more most of the wf studies were based on the evaluation of the vertical soil water balances and only a few wf assessments on crop production were related to the local regional hydrological cycle which can be effectively shown by distributed hydrological models although luan et al 2018a b employed the swat model for the calculation of crop wfs at the irrigation district level the temporal scale was limited to annual assessments several indicators of water scarcity especially with respect to blue water scarcity have been developed and widely assessed liu et al 2017 vanham et al 2018 there are water scarcity indicators that provide a comparison between water availability and population such as water shortage falkenmark et al 1989 there are indicators that measure the exceedance of water withdrawal with respect to water demand hanasaki et al 2008 and there are indicators related to the balance between water withdrawal and water availability oki and kanae 2006 moreover several indicators consider the proportion of water requirement to water availability rockström et al 2009 the wf based water scarcity indicator which is ratio of the wf to water availability was introduced by hoekstra et al 2012 the wf based indicator of water scarcity solved limitations of the previous water scarcity indicators with respect to neglecting the return flow during the withdrawal of water for usage with regard to water appropriation liu et al 2017 vanham et al 2018 in addition it provides a consistent approach about simultaneous evaluation of blue and green water scarcities in specific regions which was successfully applied to the savannah river basin veettil and mishra 2016 in most cases water scarcity issues for large basins are defined by spatial and temporal mismatch between water consumption and provision within a year even though the total amount of water resources is abundant for the whole basin oki and kanae 2006 apparently comprehensive evaluation and hotpot identification of blue and green wrs water consumptions and water scarcities with respect to location time and frequency are therefore crucial for the sustainable water management and better water allocation at basin level the aim of this study was taking the study case for the yellow river basin yrb over 2010 2018 and the quantification of the inter and intra annual variations in the blue and green wrs wfs and water scarcities at the large river basin and sub basin levels twelve types of major crops were considered which accounted for 88 of the harvested area in nine provinces across the yrb in 2018 nbsc 2019 compared with the previously mentioned studies there are two improvements in the current study first the effect of irrigation on blue and green wrs was considered second with reference to the literature this study quantifies intra annual variations in not only blue wfs but also green wfs related to crop production at a basin level in addition to our knowledge the swat model is applied for the first time for mapping monthly blue and green wfs at croplands 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yellow river yr is the second longest river in china and the fifth longest river in the world covering an area of 795000 km2 fig 1 the yr which is 5464 km originates from the bayan kara mountain in qinghai province of china and flows through nine provinces namely shaanxi henan shandong inner mongolia sichuan gansu shanxi ningxia and qinghai thereafter it eventually flows through shandong to bohai sea it is divided into the upper middle and lower reaches the dividing point of the upper and middle reaches of the yr is in hekou near wanjiazhai and the dividing point of the middle and lower reaches is in taohuayu near huayuankou zhang et al 2008 the northwest region of the yrb is an arid and semi arid region and the southeast region is a semi humid region fig 2 the annual average precipitation from 2000 to 2018 ranged from 200 to 800 mm the east west gradient of annual average temperature was found to be significantly larger than that of the north south gradient moreover it was found to be warmer from the west to east direction which can be mainly attributed to the monsoon climate of the ocean li et al 2016 the yrb consists of six land use types in 2015 grasslands accounted for 46 2 cultivated land accounted for 26 6 forest lands accounted for 13 6 towns accounted for 3 1 water bodies accounted for 1 7 and the remaining land was barren fig 3 2 2 swat model setup here the swat model was used to simulate the water cycle in the yrb from 2010 to 2018 with the pre heating period from 2008 to 2009 calibration period from 2010 to 2014 and validation period from 2015 to 2018 the feasibility of using swat model in simulation of water cycle in the yrb have been shown by li et al 2016 and tang et al 2013 in the current study the simulation time was based on a monthly scale the yrb was split into 35 sub basins including1889 hydrological response units hrus in the swat model the soil conservation services curve number scs cn method mishra and singh 2013 was employed for the simulation of runoff the penman monteith method eagleman 1967 was used to simulate potential evapotranspiration neitsch et al 2011 moreover the swat model requires the basic data sets of elevation meteorology soil and land use table 1 presents the description resolution and sources of the data used in this study the elevation map was obtained from usgs with an accuracy of 15 arcmin usgs 2009 the soil data was obtained from hwsd with an accuracy of 1 1000000 fao and iiasa 2008 the land use data was provided by the resource and environment data cloud platform with an accuracy of 1000 1000 m cas 2015 the data on daily weather was obtained from the national meteorological information center and 120 meteorological stations in the yrb were used nmic 2019 in addition the data of five important reservoirs from the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc 2008 2018 were added to increase the accuracy of the swat with respect to the simulation of the water cycle yrcc 2019 after the simulation the measurements on actual runoff by five hydrological stations along the main stream of yellow river yrcc 2019 were used for calibration and validation in addition to the suif 2 algorithm in swat cup abbaspour et al 2004 the calibration parameters consisted of 26 parameters related to water volume as shown in table 2 five hydrological stations were selected for calibration as they covered the upper middle and lower reaches of the yrb and can therefore suitably represent the flow of wr through the entire yrb zhang et al 2008 table 3 presents calibration and validation results the coefficient of determination r2 was greater than 0 6 the nash sutcliffe efficiency ens was greater than 0 5 and the percentage of bias pbias was less than 25 which indicates that the model yielded good simulation results moriasi et al 2007 bugaets et al 2019 fig s1 and table 3 reveal that the calibration and validation results of the runoff stations were sufficient the swat model is therefore suitable for the simulation of the yrb as the study input the data of the crop module were inputted into the swat model the growth periods of the 12 types of crops in the yrb were set in reference to zhuo et al 2016b and automatic irrigation was selected as the irrigation mode after the simulation the output data 2010 2018 of the national data network http www stats gov cn were used to check the miraca2000 yield distribution map portmann et al 2010 the yield distribution map of the yrb during the research period was then obtained thereafter the crop yield statistics at the provincial level in the basin nbsc 2019 were used to calibrate the crop yield outputs in the swat model 2 3 estimating blue and green water resources the blue wr rb mm of each sub basin indicates the blue water flow fb mm and it consists of the water yield wyld mm and the storage of groundwater δgw mm schuol et al 2008b rodrigues et al 2014 in addition to the actual evapotranspiration from irrigation water etb mm which can be kept in unsaturated soil and absorbed by plants and is then returned to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration moreover wyld represents the water flowing from the hru to the main channel and δgw represents the water entering the aquifer gw rchg mm minus the water entering the main channel from the aquifer gw q mm kaur et al 2019 in the yrb agriculture is well developed and there are many irrigation areas irrigation leads to crop evapotranspiration which contains a portion of blue wrs it is therefore essential to improve the calculation method of blue water in the study 1 f b w y l d g w r c h g g w q n o i r r i g a t i o n f

the atmosphere via evapotranspiration falkenmark and rockström 2006 2 f g e t n o i r r i g a t i o n f g e t g i r r i g a t i o n 2 4 estimating blue and green wfs the total wf of every crop can be added based on the crop evapotranspiration et 3 c w u g p e t t i where cwu mm represents the water consumption et mm is the crop evapotranspiration t means time i means crop type and gp is the growth period of the crops the calculation method of the wf per unit yield of 12 types of crops in the yrb is as follows 4 w f g 10 i 1 m t 1 n e t g i t y i w f b 10 i 1 m t 1 n e t b i t y i where wfg and wfb m3 t 1 are the green and blue wfs of the crops etg t i and etb t i mm represent the actual evapotranspiration of hrui on day t of the crop growth period yi t ha 1 is the crop yield per unit area of hrui and the coefficient of 10 is for the conversion of mm into m3 ha 1 the blue and green wfs in the growth period of crops can be calculated using the following soil water balance formula zhuo et

precipitation irr mm is the irrigation water consumption et mm is the actual evapotranspiration ro mm is the surface runoff dp mm denotes the infiltration and side flow through the bottom of the soil profile and loss mm denotes the water lost in the hydrological cycle the industrial and domestic wfs were all considered as blue wfs the industrial and domestic blue water intakes of each province from 2010 to 2018 were obtained from the national data http data stats gov cn and the population density distribution map of the yrb obtained from resource and environment data cloud platform http www resdc cn was then used to calculate the industrial and domestic blue wfs of the yrb the evaporation of the water surface of the reservoirs leads to the generation of the blue wf zhuo et al 2019 from the output results of the swat model the evaporation of the water surface blue wf of the reservoir was determined 2 5 estimating blue and green scarcities the blue water scarcity was measured as the ratio of the blue wf to the available blue wr moreover the blue wf can be divided into the crop blue wf industrial blue wf domestic blue wf and reservoir blue wf 6 b w s b w f b w a where bws is the blue water scarcity bwf m3 is the blue wf and bwa m3 is the available blue wr the available blue wr is the total blue wr minus the environmental flow used to maintain the environment in this study the presumptive standard method was used to calculate the environmental flow richter et al 2012 the environmental flow accounted for 80 of the total runoff and the remaining 20 of the runoff was considered as the available blue wrs for agriculture industry and domestic 7 efr 0 8 q b w a q e f r where bwa is the available blue wr q is the natural runoff and efr is the environmental flow the evaluation of blue water scarcity was conducted as follows hoekstra et al 2012 bws 1 low blue water scarcity bws 1 1 5 moderate blue water scarcity bws 1 5 2 significant blue water scarcity bws greater than 2 severe blue water scarcity the green water scarcity is the ratio of green wf to the available green wr in particular the green wf includes the crop wf and it denotes the amount of green wr that are absorbed and utilized by all vegetation in the basin 8 g w s g w f g w a where gws is the green water scarcity gwf m3 is the green wf and gwa x t m3 is the available green wr the available green wr is used to maintain the growth of plants which is the initial soil water content in the first day of study period namely sw0 of the swat output veettil and mishra 2018 kaur et al 2019 moreover sw0 is the water content of the soil above the plant wilt coefficient which can be used by plants deliberty and legates 2003 it is an absolute measure of green water provision schyns et al 2015 the methodology has been widely accepted and used rodrigues et al 2014 2015 veettil and mishra 2016 2018 kaur et al 2019 by comparing the green water consumption i e the green water footprint to the absolute green water availability i e the initial soil moisture we can measure the degree to which the available green water resources in a geographical area have been appropriated schyns et al 2015 if the green water scarcity was larger than 0 5 it means there is competition over limited green water resources the green water depletion larger than half of the initial soil moisture could be met by possible additional precipitation however increasing proportion of the precipitation would be used for compensate the soil moisture and much less possibility would be for generate the due blue water resources according to the actual case of green water scarcity in the yrb the green water scarcity was evaluated as follows gws 0 5 low green water scarcity gws 0 5 1 moderate green water scarcity gws 1 1 5 significant green water scarcity gws 1 5 severe green water scarcity 3 results 3 1 blue and green wrs fig 4 shows the trends of the blue and green wrs in the yrb with respect to time at the annual and monthly scales from 2010 to 2018 the annual average blue wr was 119 33 109 m3 yr 1 which accounted for 28 7 of the annual average total wrs and the annual average green wr was 296 94 109 m3 yr 1 which accounted for 71 3 of the annual average total wrs the precipitation in 2015 which was the dry year was minimum whereas in 2018 which was the wet year it was maximum moreover the precipitation in 2011 which was the year subject to normal precipitation was at the average level the trends of the blue and green wrs with respect to time were relatively similar to that of precipitation which indicates that precipitation is closely related to the amount of blue and green wrs with an increase in precipitation a portion of the rainwater seeps into the soil to form more green wr and a portion of the rainwater forms surface runoff and subsurface flow into the river thus increasing the amount of blue wr therefore precipitation can affect the amount of blue and green wrs at the monthly scale the wet months ranged from july to september and the dry months ranged from december to february the total quantity of green water flow was larger than that of blue water flow each year especially in the wet months however in the dry months the blue water flow was more than the green water flow due to the lower precipitation less soil moisture and less green water flow in the dry month in addition to the base flow in the runoff the blue water flow in the dry month was more than green water flow the effect of precipitation on the changes in green water flow was significantly greater than that on blue water flow hence the green water flow and precipitation are closely related the total blue and green wrs in most regions ranged from 300 to 900 mm besides the total blue and green wrs increased from the upper reaches to the lower reaches first the precipitation increased from the northwest to southeast directions which resulted in an increase in the soil green water content green water second the population in the lower reach was relatively concentrated and the agriculture was relatively developed hence the natural runoff was not sufficient for human needs and the irrigation of crops consequently there was a greater exploitation of groundwater and a higher water yield which resulted in the highest amount of blue wrs in the lower reach 3 2 blue and green wfs of crops agriculture was found to be relatively well developed in the yrb moreover an extensive estimation of the consumption of blue and green water by the crops allows for a better understanding of the water consumption in the period of crop growth period in addition to the allocation of blue wrs for irrigation fig 5 presents changes in the blue and green wfs of 12 types of crops in the yrb from 2010 to 2018 at the annual and monthly scales the annual average total blue and green wf was 45 16 109 m3 yr 1 in particular the annual average green wf was 40 77 109 m3 yr 1 which accounted for 90 3 of the total wfs and the annual average blue wf was 4 39 109 m3 yr 1 which accounted for 9 7 of the total wfs the blue and green wfs of the crops were concentrated from july to september given that the growth periods of crops in the yrb were concentrated from july to september within the growth periods the crops consumed a significant amount of blue and green water several crop type hrus were under rain fed conditions throughout the year thus they did not require the consumption of blue water when green wr was not sufficient to meet the growth requirements blue wr was used for irrigation hence the blue and green wfs of crops were high from july to september the spatial distribution of crop wfs is helpful in determining the hotspots where water consumption by the crops is most significant the total blue and green wfs in the middle reach were significantly larger than those in the upper and lower reaches given that there were more crops in the middle reaches of the yrb with respect to the blue wf the irrigation areas such as the hetao irrigation area consumed a significant amount of blue water and generated a significant blue wf this was also due to the concentration of crop distribution and the small amount of precipitation in several sub basins the blue wf of the crops was 0 which indicates that the crops in the sub basin were subject to rain fed conditions and did not require the consumption of blue water table 4 reveals the water consumption level per unit yield of the 12 types of crops in the yrb in three typical years it was higher than 1000 m3 t 1 for millet soybean and cotton whereas it was lower than 100 m3 t 1 for vegetables when the wr is limited or economic value is prioritized the results can serve as a reference for the improvement of the planting structure the table also presents the percentage of the blue wf of the 12 crops maize exhibited the highest blue wf proportion which was 41 1 in 2011 whereas most crops exhibited a low percentage of 5 or less in the main growth period of maize lower precipitation leads to the irrigation for maize in general most crops such as cotton and rice grow in the rainy season and their requirement for water can be provided by rainfall 3 3 blue and green water scarcities blue water scarcity is the ratio of blue wf to available blue wr moreover it is helpful to plan the storage and allocation of blue wr by clarifying the blue water scarcity in time and space the blue scarcity ranged from 0 5 to 1 thus the yrb was in a state of low blue water scarcity furthermore the blue water scarcity in 2015 dry year was the highest with a maximum of 0 79 whereas the blue water scarcity in 2018 wet year was the lowest with a maximum of 0 48 the amount of blue wrs is closely related to the water yield and the water yield in the wet year was relatively high this resulted in a significant amount of blue water production and available blue wrs in the yrb thus the scarcity of blue water in the wet year was relatively low fig 6 presents the change trend of the blue wf and available blue and green wrs from 2010 to 2018 the peak periods of the available blue wr and blue wf were not the same moreover the peak period of available blue wr was from july to september and the peak period of blue wf was from june to july first the precipitation was concentrated from july to september thereby resulting in a large runoff in the yrb thereafter there was more available blue wr second the crop growth period was concentrated from june to july which resulted in a significant consumption of blue water thus there was a higher crop blue wf and a greater total amount of blue wf the available blue wr was generally larger than the blue wf and the monthly blue water scarcity mostly ranged from 0 5 to 1 which corresponds to a low blue water scarcity in a few months the blue water scarcity was greater than 1 and a moderate blue water scarcity was reached fig 7 presents the maps of the blue water scarcity in the wettest and driest months of three typical years most regions were subject to low blue water scarcity and the moderate significant and severe blue water scarcities were mostly concentrated in the upper reaches especially the northern region this was because the northern region was subject to less precipitation and it contained large irrigation regions wherein a significant amount of blue water consumption was required moreover the lower reaches were subject to different degrees of blue water scarcity although there was significant precipitation in the lower reaches and the available blue wr was abundant the population density was large and the crop distribution was concentrated this resulted in large domestic and industrial wfs in addition to a significantly large crop blue wf the total blue wf in the lower reaches was greater than the available blue wr thus resulting in a relatively high blue water scarcity in addition fig 7 reveals that in the three typical years the blue water scarcity in the wet months was higher than that in the dry months this is because the blue wf of the crops was significantly larger in the wet months than in the dry months the green water scarcity for the whole yrb ranged from 0 3 to 0 4 which represents a low green water scarcity fig 6 reveals that the available green wr was generally higher than the green wf and only a very few months underwent a green water scarcity greater than 1 the peak values of the green wf were concentrated in the growth period of the crops from june to august in addition the peak values of the available green wr were concentrated in the flood months from july to september fig 8 presents the green water scarcities across sub basins in the wettest and driest months of the three typical years in the dry month in general the green water scarcity was low in the entire basin given that the month was not during the growth period of crop concentration in the wet months the green water scarcity was relatively high in the source region of the upper yrb in the period of concentrated growth period due to the soil water content the available green water content of the soil was very low thus the green water scarcity was high in the middle and lower reaches of the region there were also regions with significant and severe green water scarcity which was due to the large number of irrigation areas and intensive distribution of crops this resulted in an excessive green wf and the green water scarcity according to the spatial and temporal variations of blue and green water scarcities see fig s3 several areas in the middle reaches of the yrb were subject to both blue and green water scarcities at least moderate level for a minimum of three months each year 4 discussion in this study the evolutions of the blue and green wrs wfs and water scarcities in time and space in the yrb from 2010 to 2018 were evaluated the values of several variable were from the output of the swat model which included the et water yield soil water content and underground water content therefore the accuracy of the results was significantly dependent on the accuracy of the model simulation moreover the findings of this study suggest that the quality of the land use map and elevation map can be improved the output of the swat model simulation can be presented more accurately in this study the change of land use was not considered which was a limitation and the land use map of 2015 was employed therefore in future research the impact of land use change will be considered in the sub land use classification of swat the allowable number of classification types was limited by the model moreover given that water consumption process of all crops in the yrb could not be simultaneously simulated in this study only 12 types of crops were considered for the simulation furthermore the land use classification module of the swat model should be improved and the number of sub land use classification types should be increased thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of the water consumption of all types of crops to better simulate the runoff the reservoir module was set up and the longyangxia liujiaxia wanjiazhai xiaolangdi and sanmenxia reservoirs were added which are the critical in the yrb and play a major role in regulating the runoff after the runoff simulation five hydrological stations such as tangnaihai on the main stream of the yrb were selected for calibration as suggested more reservoirs and hydrological stations should be considered in the future research to better simulate the actual case in this study when quantifying the amount of blue and green wrs the impact of irrigation on the amount of blue and green wrs was considered and the consumption of blue water and green water in et was distinguished in existing researches abbaspour et al 2015 kaur et al 2019 the blue wr was considered as the addition of the water yield and the storage of the underground water and the green wr was considered as the addition of the evaporation and the initial soil water content results of this study show that the evaporation was not completely transformed by the absorption of green water however a portion of the evaporation was transformed by the absorption of blue water this is because farmland irrigation requires the consumption of blue water wherein a portion enters the soil and is absorbed and utilized by plants thereafter it is lost via evaporation therefore in this study the improved method based on the soil balance formula zhuo et al 2016b hoekstra 2019 was employed for the calculation of the amount of evaporation caused by blue and green water therefore this study further improved the assessment method of blue and green wrs the blue wr represents the addition of the water yield the storage of groundwater and the evaporation due to blue water consumption the green wr represents the addition of the evaporation due to green water consumption and the initial soil water content zhang et al 2014 calculated the blue and green wrs in the source region of the yrb above tangnaihai station from 1960 to 2000 the blue wr in 2000 amounted to 181 mm and the green wr amounted to 448 mm xu 2013 calculated the green wr in several regions in the middle reaches of the yr the drainage region from hekou to longmen from 1950 to 2007 which amounted to 400 500 mm the current results are consist with above existing records see fig s1 when quantifying the wf blue and green wfs of crops were considered in addition to the wf per yield which indicates the water consumption level per yield of the crops in table 5 the wf per yield obtained in this study was compared with those of other studies yin et al 2019 evaluated the wfs of 12 types of crops in the yrb in 2017 and obtained similar results mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 in addition to zhuo et al 2016b studied and compared the blue and green wfs of related crops from 1996 to 2005 in the yrb compared with the results of the previously mentioned studies the wf per unit yield of most crops in this study were smaller given that the yield per area of crops increased each year thus resulting in a relatively lower water consumption per yield when quantifying the blue water scarcity a coefficient of 0 8 was used to express the proportion of environmental flow in the blue wrs after the calculation the proportions of 0 37 cai et al 2011 and 0 55 yang et al 2009 were used to analyse the sensitivity the number of sub basins above low blue water scarcity of the yrb changed from 20 to 15 0 55 and 10 0 37 the relative changes in the blue water scarcity of each sub basin in the yrb were approximately the same which did not have a significant influence on the determination of the blue water scarcity of each sub basin in the entire yrb zhuo et al 2016b calculated the blue water scarcity of the yrb at monthly scale from 1978 to 2009 and the change trend was consistent with that obtained in this study hoekstra et al 2012 calculated the distribution of blue water scarcity on a global scale from 1996 to 2005 during which the yrb was subject to high blue water scarcity compared with the two abovementioned studies the yrb was in a state of blue water scarcity however the degree of blue water scarcity detected in this study was relatively low this is because in the abovementioned studies the groundwater was not considered when calculating the blue wrs which resulted in a higher blue water scarcity during the study period the yrb was subject to blue and green water scarcities in the upper reaches of the yrb there was a high green water scarcity in the concentrated growth period of the crops due to the low content of green water in the soil the planting of trees in the source region of the yrb the improvement of the soil and the enhancement of the water holding capacity of the soil can alleviate the pressure due to the scarcity of green water from july to september most irrigated areas were subject to both blue and green water scarcities the water loss of the wr transmission and distribution can be reduced by employing various methods for example improving the reservoir regulations in wet months of low water scarcities without intervention on environmental flow requirements zhuo et al 2019 hogeboom et al 2020 more water can thus be available for alleviating the water scarcities in following months meanwhile for irrigated crop lands replacing surface water transmission by water pipe or replacing furrow by drip irrigation are effective measures to decrease wfs moreover farmers can improve the planting structure of crops and plant more crops with a lower water consumption per yield for instance planting more spring wheat rather than winter wheat or planting more sunflower while less cotton there is a large amount of groundwater exploitation in the lower reaches if there is an excessively rapid decrease in the groundwater level the growth of crops and improvement of land are impacted therefore more water should be allocated to the lower reaches to meet the demands of life industry and crop growth 5 conclusions taking the yrb over 2010 2018 as the study case the spatial and intra annual variations in blue and green wrs wfs and water scarcities were simulated the effects of irrigation on blue and green wrs were taken into account for the first time meanwhile the feasibility of the swat model for simulations at large basin scale is further confirmed there are three main findings in the current case for the yrb first green wr was larger than blue wr accounting for 71 3 in total of blue and green wrs at annual average whereas the blue water flow was larger than the green in the dry months second the blue and green wfs of crops in the middle reaches were significantly larger than those in the upper and lower reaches third even though the whole yrb generally showed relatively low blue and green water scarcity in the non crop growth period there were large areas with moderate significant and severe green water scarcity in the upper reaches moreover several areas in the middle reaches were subject to both blue and green water scarcities at least modest level for a minimum of 3 months a year on one hand identification of the hot spots suffering both blue and green water scarcities sounds the alarm for local possible irreversible degradation with water shortages on the other hand understanding both blue and green water demands and endowments helps to make appropriate measures to cope with water scarcities comprehensively apparently the current analysis highlights the importance and necessity to evaluate both blue and green wrs wfs and water scarcities in multiple space and time scales declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
