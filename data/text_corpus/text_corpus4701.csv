23505,the growing marine renewable energy sector has led to a demand for increasingly compliant mooring systems in response several innovative mooring tethers have been proposed demonstrating potential customisation to the stiffness profile and reduced peak mooring loads many of these novel systems utilise materials in a unique application within the challenging marine environment and their long term durability remains to be proven this paper presents a multifaceted investigation into the durability of a novel polyester mooring tether with an elastomeric core laboratory based functionality tests are repeated on tether assemblies following a 6 month sea deployment results show a 45 average increase in dynamic axial stiffness this is supported by high tension laboratory based fatigue endurance tests showing a peak increase in dynamic axial stiffness of 42 sub component material tests on the core elastomer support the assembly tests separately demonstrating that certain aspects of tether operation lead to increased material sample stiffness the average increase in material radial compressive stiffness is 22 and 15 as a result of marine ageing and repeated mechanical compression respectively these are the first results of this type to be published the performance durability characterisation of the tether establishes the mooring design envelope for long

places new demands on mooring system design in contrast to conventional oil and gas floating offshore systems in addition to reliably maintaining the station keeping of a device for many device designs the mooring system must also provide the compliance required to harvest energy from the marine environment synthetic mooring ropes are now commonly used in this application weller et al 2015a davies et al 2014 ridge et al 2010 having greater compliance than wire rope or chain alternatives for conventional synthetic ropes the compliance is correlated to the specified minimum breaking load mbl hence the compliance of the mooring system is frequently compromised in order to achieve the required mbl to survive the loads expected during operation additional compliance can be introduced through system architecture utilising floats and weights in catenary mooring systems weller et al 2014a however this introduces complexity increases the risk of entanglement and increases the mooring footprint when ambitions for industry offshore deployments are striving for increasingly compact mooring footprints in array configurations as a response to these new demands several innovative mooring systems have been proposed to introduce greater compliance into the mooring system and in some cases provide customisation to the stiffness profile of the mooring parish and johanning 2012 mcevoy 2012 bengtsson and ekström 2010 luxmoore et al 2016 studies have shown these systems have the potential to reduce peak loads observed in the mooring system thies et al 2015 mcevoy 2012 parish et al 2017 luxmoore et al 2016 thies et al 2015 demonstrate a maximum line tension reduction of 20 and a mean line tension reduction of 10 while mcevoy 2012 shows an 80 90 load reduction in a storm scenario when substituting conventional mooring configurations for a novel elastomeric tether it is anticipated that a reduction in mooring loads will allow the down rating of other mooring components leading to a downward spiral of reduced weight and further reduced loads with the potential to reduce the structural requirements and mass of the floating body parish et al 2017 estimates suggest foundations and mooring systems account for 10 of device costs low carbon innovation coordination group 2012 and given the strong correlation between mbl and cost of mooring components harris et al 2004 the potential savings through use of these novel systems are significant ultimately the resulting mooring system will be lighter cheaper and easier to deploy if these novel systems are to be successful the long term performance must be proven and given the harsh operating environment of marine renewable energy devices this remains a key priority for these systems the focus for the work presented here is a durability assessment of the exeter tether parish and johanning 2012 focusing on both the tether assembly and detailed material tests of the elastomeric core the paper is organised into five parts in this introduction the key features and operating principles of the tether are presented section 2 methods outlines the test facilities and techniques employed section 3 results presents key findings from the study followed by a discussion in section 4 which puts these results into the operating context of the tether and addresses the limitations of the work finally section 5 details the conclusions and outlines next steps for this work 1 1 the exeter tether a detailed overview of the exeter tether and the p1 prototype series is presented in gordelier et al 2015 a summary is provided here based upon the specific prototype iteration utilising a core of seven solid elastomeric cords the exeter tether comprises a hollow polyester rope braided around a core assembly of epdm ethylene propylene diene monomer polymer strands wrapped in an anti friction membrane as detailed in fig 1 a the polyester rope acts as the predominant load carrier and is terminated at either end with an eye splice the key principles of operation to appreciate are 1 when under load the tether extends along its length axially and simultaneously contracts across its diameter diametrically according to the helix angle of the braided rope 2 as the rope diameter contracts the elastomer core is compressed radially the core resists this compression and thereby acts to resist the axial extension of the rope 3 the compressibility of the elastomeric core dictates the resistance to diametric contraction and in turn controls the axial extension this compressibility is determined by both the cross sectional form of the core and the material selection 4 the helix angle of the braided rope dictates the ratio of the force vectors that act axially to extend the rope and circumferentially to compress the core typical helix angles for the p1 prototype series are detailed in gordelier et al 2015 5 points 3 and 4 result in two distinct phases of tether extension as detailed in fig 2 a phase 1 during the first phase of extension the elastomeric core strands are more easily deformed from seven individual round sections to eliminate the free space between the strands at the same time the helix angle is high giving the braided rope considerable mechanical advantage in compressing the core these factors combine to produce low axial stiffness during the first phase of extension b phase 2 as the free space in the core bundle tends towards zero the resistance to further radial compression increases non linearly simultaneously the extension of the tether also reduces the helix angle of the braid thus reducing the rope s mechanical advantage over the core these changes result in a second phase of extension which displays a marked increase in axial stiffness critically the choice of core geometry and material can be selected completely independently of the hollow rope thus a series of tethers with the same mbl can be designed with a range of compliance values selected specifically for a device or location the working concept of the tether is presented in gordelier et al 2015 this details the results from a proof of concept study with the p1 series of 14 tether prototypes comprising a range of tether stiffness profiles achieved by varying the profile geometry and the shore a hardness value of the elastomeric strands the results presented in this paper focus on three of these tethers the construction of these tethers is detailed in table 1 it should be noted that the sheathing acts as an anti friction membrane and to limit biofouling of the elastomeric core but will have minimal effect on the stiffness profile of the tether if the benefits of increased compliance offered by the exeter tether are to be realised the long term performance of the tether must be understood the work presented in this paper outlines an investigation into the evolution of the stiffness profile of the tether when subjected to both sea trials and high load fatigue testing it compares functional tether assembly test results to material tests which include analyses of the effects of marine ageing and cyclic compression on the epdm core material this work is of critical importance to the ongoing development of the exeter tether and is also of interest to other mooring developers utilising elastomers in their proposed novel mooring systems mcevoy 2012 bengtsson and ekström 2010 mooring designers looking to exploit novel mooring systems will be interested in these findings for improved understanding of long term performance and to inform the correct specification of mooring system configurations utilising these novel solutions finally establishing the impact of marine ageing and compression testing on epdm will be of interest to anyone utilising this material in these or other relevant applications 1 2 research approach the work presented in this paper details a combined approach utilising both assembly test techniques and sub component material tests to investigate the durability of the elastomeric tether in the proposed operating environment to provide an overview of the test approaches applied table 2 is included which outlines the assembly and sub component investigations completed each of the listed test procedures has a dedicated section in the method results and discussion chapters that follow 2 methods the challenge for offshore technology innovations is validation during early development in order to demonstrate and eventually commercialise a novel concept whilst full scale field tests are preferable and reduce potential scale induced uncertainties mueller and wallace 2008 they are expensive and challenging to control laboratory based tests offer a high degree of control but can limit the scale and relevant factors that can be investigated salter 2003 this work has chosen a combined approach based on realistic large scale field test exposure the operational durability of the tether is assessed the assessment is further enhanced through repeated controlled experimental tests at assembly and sub component level the performance durability appraisal can thus be based on both test methods this section initially describes facilities utilised before describing the test procedures adopted 2 1 test facilities tether prototypes were exposed to realistic operational conditions through deployment on a mooring limb of the south west mooring test facility swmtf this is an at sea test facility located just inside the harbour limits of falmouth bay cornwall uk a fully autonomous instrumented buoy is configured to enable mooring components under investigation to be deployed on mooring limbs and exposed to a typical mooring environment with in line and tri axial load cells to monitor mooring loads further details of the facility are provided in johanning et al 2008 for the purposes of this work the swmtf test facility was utilised to expose exeter tether prototypes to both marine ageing and simultaneous cyclical loading at typical mooring loads controlled testing of the tether assembly was conducted in the dynamic marine component test facility dmac this facility provides fully submersible freshwater testing of components up to 6m in length and 0 8m diameter with a 1m stroke linear hydraulic actuator able to deliver tension or compression forces of 30t dynamically and 45t statically further details of the test facility are available in johanning et al 2010 the 444 kn pancake load cell controlling the linear actuator is calibrated annually and upon re positioning a full calibration was conducted in advance of this work and is reported in gordelier et al 2015 material testing of the epdm was conducted at the ifremer 1 1 institut français de recherché pour l exploitation de la mer marine structures laboratory iso7743 tests were conducted using an instron 5566 load frame with a 10 kn load cell compression fatigue testing of the samples was conducted using an mts test machine with a 250 kn load cell immersion of material samples in natural sea water was conducted using a bespoke system developed at ifremer comprising a 60 l fresh seawater tank the water was maintained at a constant temperature of 60 c whilst being continually renewed with fresh sea water from the brest estuary at a replacement rate of 60 l 24hrs all equipment in the ifremer laboratory is annually calibrated as part of the iso9001 quality management systems accreditation of the laboratory 2 2 assembly functionality tests following sea trials four prototype tethers were deployed on mooring limb 1 of the swmtf from 4th june 2013 to 26th november 2013 mooring limb 1 and mooring limb 3 installed at 185 and 65 respectively experience the highest mooring loads due to the dominant wave conditions on the site as observed during previous deployments harnois et al 2013 2016 the composition of a typical swmtf mooring limb is detailed by harnois et al in harnois et al 2012 the existing 20m section of nylon rope at the top of the mooring line was replaced with four tethers the focus for the work presented in this paper is tethers p1 3 and p1 8 with epdm core shore a hardness values of 59a and 70a respectively p1 8 was situated at the top of the mooring line connected into the tri axial load cell of the swmtf via shackles p1 3 was connected into p1 8 via a lanyard hitch this top zone of the mooring line where p1 3 and p1 8 were located was anticipated to be the most aggressive zone for tether deployment a qualitative assessment of the tethers was conducted following the deployment to assess degradation of the tether and sub components this assessment is reported in gordelier et al 2015 for the purposes of the work presented here in order to quantitatively assess the change in dynamic axial stiffness of the tethers the dmac test facility was used to conduct tether functionality tests both before and after the six month sea deployment force driven conditioning tests were conducted followed by a displacement driven test exercising the tether to a displacement of 0 9m for 5 cycles at an 8s period the displacement of 0 9m was selected to maximise the extension available within the 1m stroke range of dmac and a cycle period of 8s was selected to represent a typical operating period this is important due to the time dependant nature of the epdm core material the drive data for this test ett 08 are presented in gordelier et al 2015 and the load extension results from the fifth cycle of this test were extracted and processed to establish the stiffness profile of the tethers pre and post swmtf deployment the processing involved a deduction to account for the extension of the eye splices as measured and reported by gordelier et al 2015 to account for the reduced eye splice extension following the sea deployment an adjustment was made assuming that the extension of the eye splice reduces in accordance with a typical worked polyester rope the viking braidline polyester rope was selected as the most appropriate reference rope which over the full operating range demonstrates an average reduction in extension of approximately 25 upon working bridon 2017 various approaches are suggested by mckenna et al 2000 to quantify axial stiffness and further alternative approaches are applied by davies et al 2012 flory et al 2004 and iso 2007 in this assessment the secant modulus approach was adopted utilising linear interpolation to calculate the exact strain at specified loads during load up of the fifth cycle and plotting the secant between these loads to normalise this value it was divided by the tether mbl as suggested by davies et al 2002 given the dynamic nature of these tests at 0 125 hz this non dimensional parameter is termed dynamic axial stiffness k d given the two distinct phases of tether stiffness as outlined in section 1 1 k d is quantified separately for each phase during these basic functionality tests the first phase was identified between a load of 5 10 kn and the second phase from 20 to 40 kn adapting the equations detailed in iso 2007 the stiffness can be written numerically as 1 k d x y f y f x f m b s ε y ε x where k d x y is the dynamic axial stiffness between loads x and y f x and f y are the loads at x and y respectively f m b s is the minimum breaking load of the sample and ε x and ε y are the calculated strains at x and y respectively this approach was repeated for tether prototypes p1 3 and p1 8 before and after the swmtf deployment further to the assessment of the tether stiffness profile it was originally anticipated that an assessment of load data from the 69 kn axial load cells and 69 kn tri axial load cells located at the top of each mooring line would allow for a quantitative assessment of the impact of the mooring tether on mooring loads and additionally log the load exposure profile of the tethers during the deployment however the load cells failed early during this deployment numerical modelling to estimate mooring loads utilising data collected from the swmtf inertial measurement unit imu and digital global positioning system dgps is ongoing and will be the subject of future publications typical load profiles for swmtf mooring limbs during previous deployments are detailed by harnois et al 2016 and demonstrate peak mooring loads for limb 1 exceeding 50 kn with typical operational mooring loads below 10 kn and typical peak periods ranging from 2 to 11 s 2 3 tension tension assembly fatigue tests to establish a fatigue performance benchmark for the p1 series a thousand cycle load limit tcll test was conducted this test designed by the oil company s international marine forum ocimf was established to quantify mooring hawser response to tension tension fatigue oil companies international marine forum 2000 the test subjects the component to a series of 1000 tension cycles at increasing load levels starting with 50 nwbs new wet breaking strength and increasing in 10 increments until the sample fails the test is conducted with the tether fully submerged in fresh water full details of the test method establishing the nwbs of the tether 222 kn and the full calculation of the tcll value for the tether are presented in gordelier et al 2015 of specific interest to the work presented here is the stiffness performance of the tether the tcll test was therefore analysed to quantify the evolution in dynamic axial stiffness of the tether throughout the tcll testing series the test failed during cycling at 70 nwbs so there is a full data set of 1000 cycles at 50 and 60 nwbs load levels and a partial set of data available at 70 nwbs load level the sample failed on 176th cycle of the 70 level the tether utilised for the tcll test was p1 16 this is a modified tether with a reduced working length to enable the high extensions of the tcll test to be achieved within the working constraints of dmac the tether core is manufactured from seven ø20 mm 70 shore a epdm strands from supplier b due to the different construction of this tether it is not possible to directly compare the results to those from the field test at the swmtf the results however do provide useful insight into the evolving stiffness profile of the tether design concept when worked at high loads the secant modulus approach was again adopted here as one of the standard approaches suggested by mckenna et al 2000 again to reflect the two distinct phases of tether operation k d was calculated separately for each phase due to the different tether construction and test parameters the load values identified to represent the two phases of tether operation were updated for these fatigue tests with the phase 1 secant from 10 to 30 kn and the phase 2 secant from 60 to 100 kn selecting 100 kn as the peak value for the secant ensured a consistent approach was applied between load levels as a full secant could be captured even at the lowest load level which peaked at 110 kn the dynamic stiffness was calculated at a range of cycle numbers throughout the tcll test at each cycle of interest the data was linearly interpolated to calculate the exact strain at the specified load level and utilising equation 1 the dynamic stiffness k d was calculated 2 4 sub component epdm material tests 2 4 1 establishing baseline material properties a key principal of the tether is the control of axial stiffness by varying the core material and construction with each core configuration providing a particular resistance to compression the compression stress strain properties of the core material are therefore critical to the operation of the tether understanding how these material properties might be affected by ageing of the core material or exposure to multiple compression fatigue cycles is important for ascertaining long term performance iso7743 2011 rubber vulcanized or thermoplastic determination of compression stress strain properties iso 2011 provides a standard to calculate the compression modulus of a given polymer quantifying this property for virgin material can then be used as a benchmark to compare with further material tests following marine ageing or compression fatigue exposure it should be noted the iso7743 test is conducted in air 2 4 1 1 axial compression modulus the iso7743 test procedure was followed to subject a cylinder of material to axial compression at a rate of 10 mm min to induce a strain of 0 25 the load was then removed at the same rate this was repeated to give four compression cycles in total data from the fourth cycle was used to calculate the compression modulus at a strain of 0 1 and 0 2 using equation 2 2 e c x σ x ε x where e c x is the compression modulus at strain x in mpa σ x is the stress at strain x which is calculated by f x a o in mpa ε x is the strain at x which is calculated by l x l o l o f x is the load at strain x n a o is the original area mm2 2 four methods are listed a d in the standard method c specifies the sample can be lubricated or not lubricated and compressed at a speed of 10 mm min to a strain of 0 25 for four uninterrupted cycles refer to iso 2004 for full details l x is the length at strain x mm and l o is the original length mm the iso standard provides a choice of test pieces and methods the results presented here are based on the procedure standard reference test piece b fig 3 a method c 2 as the epdm material was supplied in 25 mm extruded section and the compression modulus is affected by both the material properties and the manufacturing process the standard test piece b dimensions were scaled up so that the test could be conducted on the 25 mm section these dimensions are detailed in fig 3b results from these tests compressing the sample axially along the axis of the extruded epdm are referred to as the axial compression modulus acm for each test condition three separate samples were tested 2 4 1 2 radial compressive stiffness in addition to the acm tests of specific interest to the operation of the tether is the compressibility of the epdm across the diameter of the cord this is not a standard iso test and unlike the acm tests the cross section of the sample in the radial direction is not consistent and the stiffness in this direction is related to both the material and the geometry of the sample as this is not a standard test it is not comparable to external sources however quantifying the stiffness of the sample in this direction allows for a direct comparison across the range of epdm hardness values and an understanding of how fatigue compression exposure and marine ageing of the material affect this crucial property the same procedure was followed as outlined for acm as this is not a direct calculation of material modulus this result is referred to as the radial compressive stiffness rcs the target dimensions for the rcs samples are detailed in fig 3c it should be noted that in some of the extruded epdm sections a 2 3 mm flat ridge was evident running along the length of the cord this was a product of the manufacturing extrusion process to minimise the effect of this ridge the sample was orientated ensuring the ridge was at the side and the sample was marked with a white dot to ensure consistency between sample measurements and test procedures three repeat tests were performed for both acm and rcs across the range of shore a hardness values specified 54 59 70 70 7 and 80 7 the durability aspect of this work was to ascertain whether these properties are affected by the operational requirements of the tether and a mid range epdm with shore a hardness 70 7 was selected for further testing as detailed below 2 4 2 marine exposure investigation in operation the exeter tether will be submerged in the marine environment for extended periods of time at the time of writing there is no published data regarding the stability of epdm in a submerged marine environment and this information is critical to establishing the marine durability of this elastomeric tether in service in a limited test window a widely used approach to accelerate the effect of polymer ageing in a marine environment is to immerse samples in heated sea water there is a significant amount of literature detailing the use of this approach for ageing polymers celina et al 2005 gillen et al 2005 le gac et al 2012 le saux et al 2014 scheirs 2000 wise et al 1995 a linear arrhenius extrapolation is generally used to relate the accelerated ageing conducted at elevated temperatures and extrapolate this to estimate the effects of longer term ageing at lower temperatures this relationship relates reaction rate to time and temperature through the relationship detailed in equation 3 celina et al 2005 3 k a e e a r t where k is the reaction rate a is the pre exponential factor e a is the arrhenius activation energy r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is the temperature in k from equation 3 the natural logarithm of reaction rate k can be related to the inverse of temperature 1 t via a linear relationship as detailed by celina et al 2005 degradation time t is related to reaction rate by 1 k to date there are no data available for the specific effect of marine ageing at an elevated temperature on epdm based on previous work ageing polymers le gac et al 2012 60 c was selected as an appropriate temperature to speed up the ageing process but minimise oxidation of the epdm which could result in excessive deterioration of the material epdm samples were cut to the dimensions detailed in fig 3c and immersed in natural sea water tanks as detailed in section 2 1 heated to a temperature of 60 c for a period approaching 13 months 15 05 2014 10 06 2015 regular weight measurements were recorded to monitor sample saturation immediately following removal from tanks the iso7743 test procedure was conducted as detailed in section 2 4 1 to establish the rcs following marine ageing 2 4 3 radial compression fatigue investigation during operation the tether extends and contracts to accommodate the wave induced motion of a floating body this in turn exposes the epdm core to repeated radial compression and axial extension cycles this is a durability concern for the tether as the long term consequence of these actions is unknown to investigate the potential effects of this process samples of the epdm core were subjected to repeated compression cycles and the iso7743 procedure was used to calculate the rcs of the sample following this exposure material samples were prepared to the dimensions detailed in fig 3c and set up in the mts compression test machine using a 250 kn load cell a small dot of cyanoacrylate was used to secure the underside of the cord to the mts load platen as during trials the sample had been observed slipping out of the test machine a compromise was required in specifying a frequency that maximises the number of cycles in a given test window whilst limiting the self heating of the sample a preliminary investigation into the test parameters using an infra red camera indicated that at a compressive diametral strain of 0 2 the frequency of compression cycles should be limited to 2 hz frequencies greater than this led to excessive self heating of the epdm sample with surface temperatures beyond 10 c the mts machine was set to operate in displacement mode with a diametral strain of 0 2 calculated from the average of three measurements of the cord diameter the test sample was subjected to 707 000 compression cycles to a strain of 0 2 and a frequency of 2 hz the rcs test procedure outlined in section 2 4 1 was conducted immediately following the compressive testing and at subsequent intervals to observe any time dependency in the results conducting the iso test both radially and axially on one single sample was not considered good practice as one procedure may affect the other and as the critical property of interest in this instance was the radial compressive stiffness the test was only conducted radially 3 results 3 1 assembly functionality tests following sea trials following a sea deployment approaching 6 months processed data from the fifth load up cycle of dmac functionality test ett 08 is detailed in fig 4 the secant for each line is identified in this figure between 5 and 10 kn for phase 1 and from 20 to 40 kn for phase 2 the calculated values for k d are also identified for both virgin and worked samples table 3 presents the calculated increase in dynamic stiffness observed following the swmtf deployment for each phase of operation key observations from this assessment are a measurable increase in dynamic stiffness of the tethers following the sea deployment the majority of the increase in stiffness is observed in phase 1 of operation with an increase of 54 and 110 for tethers p1 3 and p1 8 respectively additionally and perhaps more critically the stiffness profiles of the worked tethers have become more aligned settling on a similar stiffness profile as highlighted by fig 4 pre deployment during phase 1 p1 3 demonstrated a stiffness 13 greater than p1 8 however following deployment the stiffness during this phase was 15 less than p1 8 during phase 2 the difference in stiffness between p1 3 and p1 8 dropped from 17 to 6 following deployment given the design philosophy behind the tether is to establish a range of stiffness profiles this finding is very relevant and will be further addressed in the discussion section 4 3 2 tension tension assembly fatigue tests data from the tcll test is analysed to establish the evolution in dynamic axial stiffness of the tether throughout the test an example of the approach is detailed in fig 5 which highlights the analysis for the 1 50 load level and details the secants established for the calculation of k d to complement this graph table 4 details the calculated value of k d at each cycle and the change in stiffness from cycle 5 during the 1 50 load level there is an initial period of high increase in dynamic stiffness during the first 250 cycles there is an increase of 11 and 33 for phase 1 and phase 2 behaviour respectively for phase 1 the stiffness stabilises and from cycles 250 950 the stiffness increases by a further 3 whilst phase 2 stiffness increases by a further 10 during the last 250 cycles of this range the maximum increase is just 1 in both phases the same procedure was repeated for the 1 60 load level and the 1 70 load level fig 6 provides a summary for the complete tcll test series capturing the dynamic axial stiffness calculated from the secants of phase 1 and phase 2 at cycles selected from all load levels plotting the data in this way highlights that the dominant change in stiffness during this high load fatigue test occurs in phase 2 of the tether operation where the functionality is dominated by the polyester rope rather than the epdm core the drop in stiffness observed between tcll load levels is the result of adjustments required for the test set up to accommodate recovery of the tether between load levels following completion of one load level the test ends at a load of 1 nwbs however as the tether recovers it attempts to contract in length as it is fixed in the test machine the result of this is an increase in load to obtain a starting load of 1 nwbs for the subsequent load level slack must therefore be introduced into the system which results in the decrease in stiffness observed between the tcll loading levels the results in fig 6 also show a small reduction in stiffness occurring in phase 2 at the start of the 1 60 load level this could be due to the higher load level causing local damage in the rope construction or slippage within the tether construction where the hollow braided rope slips off the tether core following this initial drop however a steady increase in stiffness is observed though less pronounced than the 1 50 range with a maximum increase of 6 over the full 1000 cycles the stiffness again stabilises at higher cycle numbers results from the final load level of 1 70 demonstrate the gradual reduction in tether stiffness in phase 2 as the polyester rope yields further and approaches final failure 3 3 sub component epdm material tests 3 3 1 establishing baseline material properties a typical load strain plot from the iso7743 test procedure is detailed in fig 7 the plot reveals the full extent of the mullins effect that is observed in elastomers it is characterised by the permanent softening of the stress strain curve observed the first time a polymer is exposed to a compression or tension load cantournet et al 2009 this can be seen in fig 7 where cycle 1 requires a greater load than any subsequent cycles utilising data from the fourth load cycle for the iso calculations ensures the mullins effect does not distort the results although this effect is clearly observable during the iso7742 tests the impact of this softening is minimal in comparison to the effects from marine exposure and radial compression of the material samples in line with the iso standard the fourth data cycle for each test run is extracted and good repeatability is observed between the repeat tests for each sample condition the acm or rcs is calculated at both 0 1 and 0 2 strain using equation 2 it should be noted that the 0 strain point is determined from the point at which the curve of the last cycle meets the strain axis where force 0n this point is referred to as relative 0 strain as it is not the absolute strain value linear interpolation is again used to extract the exact values at the required points where applicable the average and standard deviation of each data set is calculated and the results can be seen in chart form in fig 8 as expected a positive correlation can be seen between shore a hardness and the calculated values for acm and rcs the observed range of stiffness values are a dominant factor controlling the variety of stiffness profiles observed in the tether assembly it is also evident that at each shore a hardness value the acm and rcs calculated at a strain of 0 2 is always higher than that calculated at a strain of 0 1 again this is intuitively expected at the higher strain level of 0 2 the sample is under greater compression and it will therefore demonstrate increased resistance to any further compression and thus a higher result for acm or rcs having established baseline values of acm and rcs across a range of shore a hardness values a mid range epdm material shore a hardness 70 7 was selected for a detailed analysis of the effect of marine ageing and fatigue compression cycles on key material properties these results are presented in the next section 3 3 2 marine exposure investigation during the marine exposure testing samples were periodically removed for weighing to observe the saturation of the samples it was anticipated that the weight of the samples would stabilise over time once fully saturated at 13 months although the rate had slowed a small amount of weight gain was still occurring fig 9 due to time limitations however the samples were removed at this point for testing following removal from the heated water the iso7743 test was repeated on the aged samples of epdm again the procedure was repeated on three samples from each range and fig 10 details the average and standard deviation of these samples in comparison with the virgin material the ageing process has significantly increased the material resistance to compression with acm increasing by 14 and 16 at strains of 0 1 and 0 2 respectively whilst rcs increased by 22 at both values of strain given the compression of the epdm core is a significant factor controlling the stiffness profile of the operating tether assembly as detailed in gordelier et al 2015 this finding has significant implications for the operation of the tether which will be further explored in the discussion 3 3 3 radial compression fatigue investigation rcs results calculated using the iso7743 approach following 707 000 compression cycles at a strain of 0 2 and a frequency of 2 hz can be seen in fig 11 these results show that the immediate rcs of the sample measured 12 min after the compression cycles does not reflect the ultimate rcs once the sample has had time to recover at the 12 min point there is not a consistent change for rcs measured at 0 1 and 0 2 strain at a strain of 0 1 rcs is 7 less than the control sample whilst at a strain of 0 2 it is 11 higher over time this difference diminishes at 42h20 the rcs is 13 and 15 higher than the average control at strains of 0 1 and 0 2 respectively iso7743 is finally repeated 66h20 after the compression cycling and provides rcs values 14 and 16 higher than the average control at strains of 0 1 and 0 2 respectively ultimately these results show that exposure to extended compression cycling at a strain of 0 2 can lead to a 15 average increased resistance to compression in comparison to the un fatigued control sample 4 discussion 4 1 assembly functionality tests following sea trials on comparing the observed increase in tether stiffness following the sea deployment to the expected performance for a conventional fibre rope the literature is inconclusive although different methods have been applied weller et al 2015b review the performance of a nylon seven parallel stranded rope and suggest a decrease in axial stiffness following an 18 month deployment at the swmtf this change in performance is attributed to mild internal abrasion damage occurring in the rope construction due to yarn on yarn wear accelerated by the ingress of particulate matter including biofouling during deployment this result is of interest in the context of synthetic ropes however it is not directly comparable to the tether polyester rope the finding from weller et al 2015b is in contrast with results presented by bitting 1980a who observes an increase in axial stiffness for both nylon and polyester ropes when exposed to the ocean environment for 4 5 years the polyester rope investigated is 8 strand plaited and double braided in construction and the dynamic stiffness increases 10 25 following the sea exposure further to this data published by rope manufacturers generally indicate an increase in stiffness for worked ropes with separate performance curves provided for new and worked ropes to inform system design typical worked graphs are published by rope manufacturer bridon bridon 2017 and demonstrate an average increase in stiffness of approximately 25 over the working range of a worked polyester rope although the precise definition of worked is not specified rope construction and material selection will significantly effect the change in stiffness observed but overall it is anticipated that in the short to medium term synthetic ropes will get stiffer with use as noted by weller et al 2015b a reduction in stiffness will be observed as the rope approaches failure particularly if the failure mechanism is fatigue given the changes observed in the stiffness profiles of worked conventional mooring ropes it is unsurprising to observe a change to the operating profile of the exeter tether prototypes following sea deployment as the outer load carrying jacket is a hollow braided polyester rope it is interesting to note however that the dominant change in the stiffness of the worked tethers following sea deployment occurs during phase 1 of operation which is dominated by the compression of the epdm core as outlined in section 1 1 the average increase in stiffness following deployment of both tethers for phase 1 is 82 in contrast to phase 2 with an average increase of 8 during the exeter tether operation although phase 1 is dominated by the epdm core material properties the increase in stiffness of the load carrying polyester rope will have an impact on tether operation across both phase 1 and phase 2 the design concept of the p1 tether series utilises a standard braided rope jacket with a range of different polymer core specifications to achieve a variety of axial stiffness responses as demonstrated in gordelier et al 2015 therefore of interest is the observed reduction in operating range of the post deployment tethers given achieving this stiffness range was one of the key design intentions for the p1 tether series results from epdm material testing indicate an increase in stiffness of the epdm material which would certainly lead to an alteration in overall tether stiffness profile these results are discussed in more detail in sections 4 3 and 4 4 of relevance to these tether assembly tests and the controlled assembly fatigue tests discussed in the next section is the stiffness of standard polyester mooring lines and this behaviour in relation to average load and load amplitude expanding upon earlier work by bitting et al 1980b investigations with a 12 strand parallel laid polyester rope presented by fernandes et al 1999 demonstrate there is an increase in stiffness proportional to the average load applied and a decrease in stiffness proportional to the load amplitude with a limited effect from loading frequency this work has been confirmed and further developed by davies et al 2002 who also demonstrate a stiffness dependence on mean load and load range for both aramid and hmpe ropes these observations are further supported by weller et al 2014b and weller et al 2015b to establish the change in tether stiffness observed pre and post swmtf deployment identical functionality test ett 08 was repeated this is a displacement driven test so small variations in the peak load of the fifth cycle are observable however the stiffness profiles are calculated at consistent loads for each sample 5 10 kn for phase 1 and 20 40 kn for phase 2 comparing the stiffness profiles in this respect should minimise the variation brought about by an increase in average load the main limitation of the tether assembly test work is due to the limited number of samples available and the large investment required for sea deployments with the high costs involved at the early stage of prototype development the total number of tethers manufactured for the p1 series was limited to 13 and no two tethers were identical given the scope of test work required from this first set of prototypes it was not possible to conduct repeat sea tests on multiple samples results should therefore be considered to give an indication of performance trends rather than definitive values for stiffness profiles 4 2 tension tension assembly fatigue tests the tcll fatigue endurance tests performed in fresh water highlight the increase in dynamic axial stiffness of the tether when subject to high load fatigue cycling in addition to the increase of the individual cycle dynamic stiffness an overall increase in sample length is measured this extension is observed in conventional fibre ropes and is due to both the permanent bedding in of the rope and end terminations material and constructional reorientation and stretch creep and visco elastic stretch which are accumulated during tension cycles flory et al 2004 work conducted on polyester fibres attributes an element of both the permanent and recoverable strain to the macromolecular rearrangement of entanglements and orientation of crystallites chailleux and davies 2005 further to this davies et al 2000 state that the majority of permanent bedding in strain is due to the material behaviour and not the rope construction for long lay length polyester mooring lines indeed the extent of the permanent stretch in polyester mooring ropes leads to a common practice of pre stretching ropes during installation to minimise future adjustments required to the mooring system deandrade and duggal 2010 regarding the recoverable element of the strain in conventional fibre rope testing recovery of the accumulated elastic stretch and visco elastic stretch is anticipated when the tension cycles stop however in the tether the time dependency of this recovery is particularly pronounced due to the additional recovery of the epdm core which takes on a temporary compression set during cyclical loading to accommodate this recovery adjustments to the dmac set up led to a perceived drop in axial stiffness as observed between load level cycles detailed in fig 6 the significance of the observed compression set is caused by the high loading levels used in the tcll test up to 70 mbl in this case critics of the tcll test procedure claim the high loading levels render it unrepresentative of the final application davies et al 2012 certainly this time dependant recovery would be much less perceptible at the typical operating range of the tether it should also be noted that the high level of loading in the tcll test procedure accelerates any wear mechanisms occurring the reduction in stiffness and final failure of the tether observed at the end of the tcll test in fig 6 would be more gradual under typical operating conditions weller et al 2014b analysed the performance of a conventional nylon rope with a parallel stranded sub rope construction during cyclical loading and found that the axial stiffness stabilises from 25 cycles in comparison to the results for the tether significant evolution is still occurring at 25 cycles which suggests that due to the novel construction of the tether establishing a stabilised axial stiffness profile during cyclical loading may take longer than for conventional fibre ropes it should be noted however that the tcll test presented here subjected the tether to significantly higher loading levels than testing presented in weller et al 2014b as discussed in section 4 1 previous work has shown some stiffness dependency on both mean load and load amplitude for standard polyester ropes fernandes et al 1999 davies et al 2002 weller et al 2014b 2015b given the increase in mean load between the tcll testing load levels it might be anticipated that an overall increase in stiffness would be observed between loading levels however due to a combination of the drop in stiffness due to adjustments between loading levels the mild reduction in stiffness at the start of the 1 60 loading level and the final failure occurring early in the 1 70 loading level no such overall increase is observed it is interesting to note however that the significant increase in stiffness observed during the tcll test series occurs in phase 2 of operation as shown in fig 5 and table 4 where the tether behaviour is dominated by the polyester rope as opposed to the epdm core 4 3 marine exposure investigation results from iso7743 testing conducted following a period of marine ageing demonstrate an average increase in sample stiffness of 15 and 22 for acm and rcs respectively to put these results into context within the range of epdm shore a hardness values specified in the p1 series fig 12 has been included this figure demonstrates that although the acm and rcs have increased following marine ageing the change has not been significant enough to alter the order of the specified epdm with the aged 70 7 still having acm and rcs values higher than for epdm 70 and lower than epdm 80 there are various mechanisms which can contribute to changes in mechanical behaviour of elastomers after wet ageing reversible mechanisms include plasticization and swelling irreversible effects include hydrolysis leaching of additives such as plasticizers and oxidation these last two and possibly swelling will tend to result in increasing stiffness while plasticization and hydrolysis may reduce it more work including physico chemical analysis is under way to identify the specific mechanisms which are involved here it should be noted that although establishing the value for acm followed the standard iso test procedure with a scaled sample size the quantification of rcs is not a standard material test the results for this are affected by both the material property and the sample geometry this test was created specifically for the tether work presented as the diametric compression behaviour of the epdm cord is of critical importance to operation of the tether controlling the axial stiffness profile during phase 1 of operation thus the rcs result is not a standard material property that can be specified but the presented work provides a better understanding of how this key property changes when the material is subject to realistic operating parameters limitations of this work revolve around the assumption that immersing epdm samples in heated sea water will accurately accelerate the natural ageing process in line with arrhenius behaviour although this technique is widely used celina et al 2005 davies and evrard 2007 le saux et al 2014 le gac et al 2012 scheirs 2000 wise et al 1995 it does have limitations with critics concerned that using temperature to accelerate the ageing process may introduce failure mechanisms that would not have occurred through natural ageing at a more representative operational temperature davies and evrard 2007 the work presented here uses one temperature 60 c to accelerate the marine ageing process assuming that an arrhenius relationship applies for epdm given the apparent implications for the material properties of the epdm samples tested an extension to this work is underway to conduct further testing over a range of different temperatures to confirm these findings and to accurately establish the arrhenius relationship for epdm further to this fatigue testing of samples in natural seawater will be conducted to establish the implications of concurrent exposure to fatigue cycling and the marine environment 4 4 radial compression fatigue investigation the long term effect of the fatigue compression cycling is an average 15 increase in rcs which was measured following 66 h of recovery however it is interesting to note that immediately after cycling the rcs is lower gradually increasing and stabilising over time with minimal change occurring between 42 and 66 h these compression test parameters represent a realistic if conservative loading scenario assembly tether testing observed radial compressive strains exceeding 0 35 during anticipated extreme conditions therefore exposing the epdm cord to fatigue compression at a strain of 0 2 during this test schedule certainly represents a genuine operational demand further to this assuming a typical wave period of 8 s 707 000 cycles represent just 65 days of operation to put this observed change of rcs into context within the range of specified epdm hardness values fig 13 has been included this figure demonstrates that despite increasing the rcs of the material the fatigued 70 7 epdm remains in consecutive order of increasing rcs with increasing shore a hardness a potential limitation for this section of work revolves around the validity of these results due to the temperature increase of the samples when under compression cycling to investigate this further detailed testing was conducted observing the temperature increase in samples when subjected to repeated compression cycles at a range of frequencies and to a varying degree of compressive strain measurable temperature increases were observed when subjecting samples to high frequency or high strain compression cycles for example at a strain of 0 2 and a frequency of 5 hz surface temperature increases peaking over 13 c were observed more significantly at a strain of 0 5 and a frequency of 2 hz surface temperature increases in excess of 35 c were observed at the centre of the sample core cross section the experimental parameters for the compression testing presented in this paper are based on a strain of 0 2 and a frequency of 2 hz observed surface temperature differentials using these parameters remain below 9 c and are therefore considered to have a minimal effect on results this temperature increase may have affected the radial compressive stiffness calculated immediately following compression testing fig 11 but should have limited effect on the longer term measured compressive stiffness values 4 5 overall discussion considering all these findings in the context of overall tether implications a pattern of increased stiffness when exposed to the marine environment and or cyclical loading is established findings from the material tests are not directly comparable to the assembly scale tests however they do offer insights into what is causing the observed changes in tether assembly behaviour the findings from the iso7743 tests following either marine ageing or radial compression fatigue of the epdm core material demonstrate an increased material resistance to compression this supports the observed increase in tether stiffness during phase 1 of tether operation following sea trials where the core will have been subject to both the marine environment and radial compression fatigue to understand the relative contribution of different aspects of the material testing to the tether assembly performance the iso7743 material findings were plotted within the context of the range of hardness values of the epdm utilised in the p1 series prototype range in figs 12 and 13 these figures demonstrate that although significant neither the marine ageing or radial compression fatigue testing shifted the order of the acm or rcs across the range of epdm shore hardness values tested the conclusion from this is that there are multiple factors leading to the increase in stiffness observed in the aged tether assemblies following sea deployment this includes changes to both the epdm material radial compressive stiffness caused by marine ageing and repeated radial compression of the core through the extension of the tether during operation and the overall increase in stiffness of the polyester rope as observed in conventional polyester ropes bitting 1980a bridon 2017 the work presented in this paper seeks to establish an understanding of the long term behaviour of the tether under typical operating parameters and does not address final failure mechanisms or fatigue failure rates to establish a specific t n curve for the tether would require a substantial test programme beyond the scope of work presented here and of limited use at this prototype stage the polyester rope is the predominant load carrier within the tether and existing t n curves for polyester rope flory and banfield 2006 can be used for fatigue estimation and design of mooring systems thies et al 2014 the improved operating stiffness profile offered by the exeter tether will reduce both peak and fatigue loads throughout the mooring system with parish et al 2017 estimating a peak load reduction of approximately 70 these load reductions should be considered when designing a floating system incorporating the tether as there are benefits that go beyond the mooring system including a potential reduction in the required size of the floating body 5 conclusions and next steps the p1 series of tether prototypes were developed to prove the design concept of the exeter tether the durability of this series was not a primary objective therefore the work presented in this paper offers some initial insights into key durability considerations for the p1 series in order to inform future design iterations controlled testing of the tether assembly following a sea deployment approaching 6 months demonstrates a measurable increase in dynamic axial stiffness with an average 82 and 8 increase in phase 1 and 2 of operation respectively critically this field deployment demonstrates that for the two samples investigated the diversity in stiffness profiles observed in the virgin tethers is reduced following a period of sea deployment as the range of stiffness profiles is a key operating principle for the tether design further work is required to establish if this reduction is observed across the full suite of tethers work is also ongoing utilising numerical models to estimate the load exposure of the tether prototypes during the swmtf deployment and to establish the reduction in peak mooring loads achieved through tether placement within the mooring system the controlled assembly fatigue testing of tether p1 16 also highlighted the increase in dynamic axial stiffness upon working the maximum increase of 42 was observed during the first loading level of 1 50 nwbs in the phase 2 secant this testing demonstrated the increase in stiffness stabilises over time reaching a natural limit it is suggested that for each tether design a minimum of 500 cycles at typical operating loads is used to ascertain a working stiffness profile for use in mooring system design the dynamics of the floating system and the resulting peak and fatigue mooring loads will be significantly affected by the mooring stiffness profile establishing the worked operating profiles of the tether assembly is of central importance to inform mooring systems designed to incorporate the tether in addition to tether assembly testing detailed material tests of the epdm core material established an increase in material stiffness when exposed to operational parameters including the marine environment and repeated compression cycles average increases in rcs of 22 and 15 were observed following marine ageing and exposure to fatigue compression cycles respectively prior to this work the effect of these parameters on epdm was unknown this information will therefore be useful to anyone intending to utilise epdm in a marine environment or an application where it is repeatedly exposed to compressive strain breaking the overall assembly down and conducting sub component tests as presented in this paper allows a greater understanding of causality regarding the observed changes in the tether assembly operation going forward it also creates an opportunity to investigate alternative materials more efficiently without the need to construct full tether assemblies for each iteration this general approach combining both field and laboratory experimentation to identify and investigate particular durability aspects of a novel component is particularly relevant for the offshore technology sector field work in this sector involves high operational costs and although it is certainly necessary to prove components in the field identifying opportunities for laboratory based testing to develop particular aspects of component investigation has shown to be an effective supplement to the field based work bringing all aspects of the work presented here together the assembly tether testing and epdm material testing corroborate one another all indicating an increased tether axial stiffness as a result of exposure to operating conditions marine ageing and low level loading from the sea deployment is found to significantly affect the stiffness during phase 1 of tether operation whilst high level fatigue loading has a greater impact on phase 2 of the tether stiffness profile the key objectives for the tether development are to increase the compliance of the mooring system and allow the specification of an axial stiffness optimised for a specific device and location whilst the tether successfully increases the overall compliance of the system as demonstrated in gordelier et al 2015 and parish et al 2017 this work has shown that the evolution of the tether stiffness profile during operation must be taken into account when designing a mooring system incorporating the exeter tether following these findings work has continued to further investigate the affect of marine ageing on epdm in addition opera a european union horizon 2020 project has commissioned the development of up scaled tether prototypes including the p3 series and the full scale p4 series which will be deployed in the bay of biscay spain the p4 tether will replace a conventional polyester rope on selected limbs of the karratu shared mooring system securing the marmok a 5 wave energy device weller et al 2017 mooring load data from this deployment will allow an assessment of the load reductions achievable with this novel mooring system and a further assessment of the operational durability of the tether assembly funding this work was supported by the engineering and physical sciences research council via a phd funded through the

23505,the growing marine renewable energy sector has led to a demand for increasingly compliant mooring systems in response several innovative mooring tethers have been proposed demonstrating potential customisation to the stiffness profile and reduced peak mooring loads many of these novel systems utilise materials in a unique application within the challenging marine environment and their long term durability remains to be proven this paper presents a multifaceted investigation into the durability of a novel polyester mooring tether with an elastomeric core laboratory based functionality tests are repeated on tether assemblies following a 6 month sea deployment results show a 45 average increase in dynamic axial stiffness this is supported by high tension laboratory based fatigue endurance tests showing a peak increase in dynamic axial stiffness of 42 sub component material tests on the core elastomer support the assembly tests separately demonstrating that certain aspects of tether operation lead to increased material sample stiffness the average increase in material radial compressive stiffness is 22 and 15 as a result of marine ageing and repeated mechanical compression respectively these are the first results of this type to be published the performance durability characterisation of the tether establishes the mooring design envelope for long

wave energy cost rcs radial compressive stiffness swmtf south west mooring test facility tcll thousand cycle load limit 1 introduction the highly dynamic nature of many marine renewable energy devices places new demands on mooring system design in contrast to conventional oil and gas floating offshore systems in addition to reliably maintaining the station keeping of a device for many device designs the mooring system must also provide the compliance required to harvest energy from the marine environment synthetic mooring ropes are now commonly used in this application weller et al 2015a davies et al 2014 ridge et al 2010 having greater compliance than wire rope or chain alternatives for conventional synthetic ropes the compliance is correlated to the specified minimum breaking load mbl hence the compliance of the mooring system is frequently compromised in order to achieve the required mbl to survive the loads expected during operation additional compliance can be introduced through system architecture utilising floats and weights in catenary mooring systems weller et al 2014a however this introduces complexity increases the risk of entanglement and increases the mooring footprint when ambitions for industry offshore deployments are striving for increasingly compact mooring footprints in array configurations as a response to these new demands several innovative mooring systems have been proposed to introduce greater compliance into the mooring system and in some cases provide customisation to the stiffness profile of the mooring parish and johanning 2012 mcevoy 2012 bengtsson and ekström 2010 luxmoore et al 2016 studies have shown these systems have the potential to reduce peak loads observed in the mooring system thies et al 2015 mcevoy 2012 parish et al 2017 luxmoore et al 2016 thies et al 2015 demonstrate a maximum line tension reduction of 20 and a mean line tension reduction of 10 while mcevoy 2012 shows an 80 90 load reduction in a storm scenario when substituting conventional mooring configurations for a novel elastomeric tether it is anticipated that a reduction in mooring loads will allow the down rating of other mooring components leading to a downward spiral of reduced weight and further reduced loads with the potential to reduce the structural requirements and mass of the floating body parish et al 2017 estimates suggest foundations and mooring systems account for 10 of device costs low carbon innovation coordination group 2012 and given the strong correlation between mbl and cost of mooring components harris et al 2004 the potential savings through use of these novel systems are significant ultimately the resulting mooring system will be lighter cheaper and easier to deploy if these novel systems are to be successful the long term performance must be proven and given the harsh operating environment of marine renewable energy devices this remains a key priority for these systems the focus for the work presented here is a durability assessment of the exeter tether parish and johanning 2012 focusing on both the tether assembly and detailed material tests of the elastomeric core the paper is organised into five parts in this introduction the key features and operating principles of the tether are presented section 2 methods outlines the test facilities and techniques employed section 3 results presents key findings from the study followed by a discussion in section 4 which puts these results into the operating context of the tether and addresses the limitations of the work finally section 5 details the conclusions and outlines next steps for this work 1 1 the exeter tether a detailed overview of the exeter tether and the p1 prototype series is presented in gordelier et al 2015 a summary is provided here based upon the specific prototype iteration utilising a core of seven solid elastomeric cords the exeter tether comprises a hollow polyester rope braided around a core assembly of epdm ethylene propylene diene monomer polymer strands wrapped in an anti friction membrane as detailed in fig 1 a the polyester rope acts as the predominant load carrier and is terminated at either end with an eye splice the key principles of operation to appreciate are 1 when under load the tether extends along its length axially and simultaneously contracts across its diameter diametrically according to the helix angle of the braided rope 2 as the rope diameter contracts the elastomer core is compressed radially the core resists this compression and thereby acts to resist the axial extension of the rope 3 the compressibility of the elastomeric core dictates the resistance to diametric contraction and in turn controls the axial extension this compressibility is determined by both the cross sectional form of the core and the material selection 4 the helix angle of the braided rope dictates the ratio of the force vectors that act axially to extend the rope and circumferentially to compress the core typical helix angles for the p1 prototype series are detailed in gordelier et al 2015 5 points 3 and 4 result in two distinct phases of tether extension as detailed in fig 2 a phase 1 during the first phase of extension the elastomeric core strands are more easily deformed from seven individual round sections to eliminate the free space between the strands at the same time the helix angle is high giving the braided rope considerable mechanical advantage in compressing the core these factors combine to produce low axial stiffness during the first phase of extension b phase 2 as the free space in the core bundle tends towards zero the resistance to further radial compression increases non linearly simultaneously the extension of the tether also reduces the helix angle of the braid thus reducing the rope s mechanical advantage over the core these changes result in a second phase of extension which displays a marked increase in axial stiffness critically the choice of core geometry and material can be selected completely independently of the hollow rope thus a series of tethers with the same mbl can be designed with a range of compliance values selected specifically for a device or location the working concept of the tether is presented in gordelier et al 2015 this details the results from a proof of concept study with the p1 series of 14 tether prototypes comprising a range of tether stiffness profiles achieved by varying the profile geometry and the shore a hardness value of the elastomeric strands the results presented in this paper focus on three of these tethers the construction of these tethers is detailed in table 1 it should be noted that the sheathing acts as an anti friction membrane and to limit biofouling of the elastomeric core but will have minimal effect on the stiffness profile of the tether if the benefits of increased compliance offered by the exeter tether are to be realised the long term performance of the tether must be understood the work presented in this paper outlines an investigation into the evolution of the stiffness profile of the tether when subjected to both sea trials and high load fatigue testing it compares functional tether assembly test results to material tests which include analyses of the effects of marine ageing and cyclic compression on the epdm core material this work is of critical importance to the ongoing development of the exeter tether and is also of interest to other mooring developers utilising elastomers in their proposed novel mooring systems mcevoy 2012 bengtsson and ekström 2010 mooring designers looking to exploit novel mooring systems will be interested in these findings for improved understanding of long term performance and to inform the correct specification of mooring system configurations utilising these novel solutions finally establishing the impact of marine ageing and compression testing on epdm will be of interest to anyone utilising this material in these or other relevant applications 1 2 research approach the work presented in this paper details a combined approach utilising both assembly test techniques and sub component material tests to investigate the durability of the elastomeric tether in the proposed operating environment to provide an overview of the test approaches applied table 2 is included which outlines the assembly and sub component investigations completed each of the listed test procedures has a dedicated section in the method results and discussion chapters that follow 2 methods the challenge for offshore technology innovations is validation during early development in order to demonstrate and eventually commercialise a novel concept whilst full scale field tests are preferable and reduce potential scale induced uncertainties mueller and wallace 2008 they are expensive and challenging to control laboratory based tests offer a high degree of control but can limit the scale and relevant factors that can be investigated salter 2003 this work has chosen a combined approach based on realistic large scale field test exposure the operational durability of the tether is assessed the assessment is further enhanced through repeated controlled experimental tests at assembly and sub component level the performance durability appraisal can thus be based on both test methods this section initially describes facilities utilised before describing the test procedures adopted 2 1 test facilities tether prototypes were exposed to realistic operational conditions through deployment on a mooring limb of the south west mooring test facility swmtf this is an at sea test facility located just inside the harbour limits of falmouth bay cornwall uk a fully autonomous instrumented buoy is configured to enable mooring components under investigation to be deployed on mooring limbs and exposed to a typical mooring environment with in line and tri axial load cells to monitor mooring loads further details of the facility are provided in johanning et al 2008 for the purposes of this work the swmtf test facility was utilised to expose exeter tether prototypes to both marine ageing and simultaneous cyclical loading at typical mooring loads controlled testing of the tether assembly was conducted in the dynamic marine component test facility dmac this facility provides fully submersible freshwater testing of components up to 6m in length and 0 8m diameter with a 1m stroke linear hydraulic actuator able to deliver tension or compression forces of 30t dynamically and 45t statically further details of the test facility are available in johanning et al 2010 the 444 kn pancake load cell controlling the linear actuator is calibrated annually and upon re positioning a full calibration was conducted in advance of this work and is reported in gordelier et al 2015 material testing of the epdm was conducted at the ifremer 1 1 institut français de recherché pour l exploitation de la mer marine structures laboratory iso7743 tests were conducted using an instron 5566 load frame with a 10 kn load cell compression fatigue testing of the samples was conducted using an mts test machine with a 250 kn load cell immersion of material samples in natural sea water was conducted using a bespoke system developed at ifremer comprising a 60 l fresh seawater tank the water was maintained at a constant temperature of 60 c whilst being continually renewed with fresh sea water from the brest estuary at a replacement rate of 60 l 24hrs all equipment in the ifremer laboratory is annually calibrated as part of the iso9001 quality management systems accreditation of the laboratory 2 2 assembly functionality tests following sea trials four prototype tethers were deployed on mooring limb 1 of the swmtf from 4th june 2013 to 26th november 2013 mooring limb 1 and mooring limb 3 installed at 185 and 65 respectively experience the highest mooring loads due to the dominant wave conditions on the site as observed during previous deployments harnois et al 2013 2016 the composition of a typical swmtf mooring limb is detailed by harnois et al in harnois et al 2012 the existing 20m section of nylon rope at the top of the mooring line was replaced with four tethers the focus for the work presented in this paper is tethers p1 3 and p1 8 with epdm core shore a hardness values of 59a and 70a respectively p1 8 was situated at the top of the mooring line connected into the tri axial load cell of the swmtf via shackles p1 3 was connected into p1 8 via a lanyard hitch this top zone of the mooring line where p1 3 and p1 8 were located was anticipated to be the most aggressive zone for tether deployment a qualitative assessment of the tethers was conducted following the deployment to assess degradation of the tether and sub components this assessment is reported in gordelier et al 2015 for the purposes of the work presented here in order to quantitatively assess the change in dynamic axial stiffness of the tethers the dmac test facility was used to conduct tether functionality tests both before and after the six month sea deployment force driven conditioning tests were conducted followed by a displacement driven test exercising the tether to a displacement of 0 9m for 5 cycles at an 8s period the displacement of 0 9m was selected to maximise the extension available within the 1m stroke range of dmac and a cycle period of 8s was selected to represent a typical operating period this is important due to the time dependant nature of the epdm core material the drive data for this test ett 08 are presented in gordelier et al 2015 and the load extension results from the fifth cycle of this test were extracted and processed to establish the stiffness profile of the tethers pre and post swmtf deployment the processing involved a deduction to account for the extension of the eye splices as measured and reported by gordelier et al 2015 to account for the reduced eye splice extension following the sea deployment an adjustment was made assuming that the extension of the eye splice reduces in accordance with a typical worked polyester rope the viking braidline polyester rope was selected as the most appropriate reference rope which over the full operating range demonstrates an average reduction in extension of approximately 25 upon working bridon 2017 various approaches are suggested by mckenna et al 2000 to quantify axial stiffness and further alternative approaches are applied by davies et al 2012 flory et al 2004 and iso 2007 in this assessment the secant modulus approach was adopted utilising linear interpolation to calculate the exact strain at specified loads during load up of the fifth cycle and plotting the secant between these loads to normalise this value it was divided by the tether mbl as suggested by davies et al 2002 given the dynamic nature of these tests at 0 125 hz this non dimensional parameter is termed dynamic axial stiffness k d given the two distinct phases of tether stiffness as outlined in section 1 1 k d is quantified separately for each phase during these basic functionality tests the first phase was identified between a load of 5 10 kn and the second phase from 20 to 40 kn adapting the equations detailed in iso 2007 the stiffness can be written numerically as 1 k d x y f y f x f m b s ε y ε x where k d x y is the dynamic axial stiffness between loads x and y f x and f y are the loads at x and y respectively f m b s is the minimum breaking load of the sample and ε x and ε y are the calculated strains at x and y respectively this approach was repeated for tether prototypes p1 3 and p1 8 before and after the swmtf deployment further to the assessment of the tether stiffness profile it was originally anticipated that an assessment of load data from the 69 kn axial load cells and 69 kn tri axial load cells located at the top of each mooring line would allow for a quantitative assessment of the impact of the mooring tether on mooring loads and additionally log the load exposure profile of the tethers during the deployment however the load cells failed early during this deployment numerical modelling to estimate mooring loads utilising data collected from the swmtf inertial measurement unit imu and digital global positioning system dgps is ongoing and will be the subject of future publications typical load profiles for swmtf mooring limbs during previous deployments are detailed by harnois et al 2016 and demonstrate peak mooring loads for limb 1 exceeding 50 kn with typical operational mooring loads below 10 kn and typical peak periods ranging from 2 to 11 s 2 3 tension tension assembly fatigue tests to establish a fatigue performance benchmark for the p1 series a thousand cycle load limit tcll test was conducted this test designed by the oil company s international marine forum ocimf was established to quantify mooring hawser response to tension tension fatigue oil companies international marine forum 2000 the test subjects the component to a series of 1000 tension cycles at increasing load levels starting with 50 nwbs new wet breaking strength and increasing in 10 increments until the sample fails the test is conducted with the tether fully submerged in fresh water full details of the test method establishing the nwbs of the tether 222 kn and the full calculation of the tcll value for the tether are presented in gordelier et al 2015 of specific interest to the work presented here is the stiffness performance of the tether the tcll test was therefore analysed to quantify the evolution in dynamic axial stiffness of the tether throughout the tcll testing series the test failed during cycling at 70 nwbs so there is a full data set of 1000 cycles at 50 and 60 nwbs load levels and a partial set of data available at 70 nwbs load level the sample failed on 176th cycle of the 70 level the tether utilised for the tcll test was p1 16 this is a modified tether with a reduced working length to enable the high extensions of the tcll test to be achieved within the working constraints of dmac the tether core is manufactured from seven ø20 mm 70 shore a epdm strands from supplier b due to the different construction of this tether it is not possible to directly compare the results to those from the field test at the swmtf the results however do provide useful insight into the evolving stiffness profile of the tether design concept when worked at high loads the secant modulus approach was again adopted here as one of the standard approaches suggested by mckenna et al 2000 again to reflect the two distinct phases of tether operation k d was calculated separately for each phase due to the different tether construction and test parameters the load values identified to represent the two phases of tether operation were updated for these fatigue tests with the phase 1 secant from 10 to 30 kn and the phase 2 secant from 60 to 100 kn selecting 100 kn as the peak value for the secant ensured a consistent approach was applied between load levels as a full secant could be captured even at the lowest load level which peaked at 110 kn the dynamic stiffness was calculated at a range of cycle numbers throughout the tcll test at each cycle of interest the data was linearly interpolated to calculate the exact strain at the specified load level and utilising equation 1 the dynamic stiffness k d was calculated 2 4 sub component epdm material tests 2 4 1 establishing baseline material properties a key principal of the tether is the control of axial stiffness by varying the core material and construction with each core configuration providing a particular resistance to compression the compression stress strain properties of the core material are therefore critical to the operation of the tether understanding how these material properties might be affected by ageing of the core material or exposure to multiple compression fatigue cycles is important for ascertaining long term performance iso7743 2011 rubber vulcanized or thermoplastic determination of compression stress strain properties iso 2011 provides a standard to calculate the compression modulus of a given polymer quantifying this property for virgin material can then be used as a benchmark to compare with further material tests following marine ageing or compression fatigue exposure it should be noted the iso7743 test is conducted in air 2 4 1 1 axial compression modulus the iso7743 test procedure was followed to subject a cylinder of material to axial compression at a rate of 10 mm min to induce a strain of 0 25 the load was then removed at the same rate this was repeated to give four compression cycles in total data from the fourth cycle was used to calculate the compression modulus at a strain of 0 1 and 0 2 using equation 2 2 e c x σ x ε x where e c x is the compression modulus at strain x in mpa σ x is the stress at strain x which is calculated by f x a o in mpa ε x is the strain at x which is calculated by l x l o l o f x is the load at strain x n a o is the original area mm2 2 four methods are listed a d in the standard method c specifies the sample can be lubricated or not lubricated and compressed at a speed of 10 mm min to a strain of 0 25 for four uninterrupted cycles refer to iso 2004 for full details l x is the length at strain x mm and l o is the original length mm the iso standard provides a choice of test pieces and methods the results presented here are based on the procedure standard reference test piece b fig 3 a method c 2 as the epdm material was supplied in 25 mm extruded section and the compression modulus is affected by both the material properties and the manufacturing process the standard test piece b dimensions were scaled up so that the test could be conducted on the 25 mm section these dimensions are detailed in fig 3b results from these tests compressing the sample axially along the axis of the extruded epdm are referred to as the axial compression modulus acm for each test condition three separate samples were tested 2 4 1 2 radial compressive stiffness in addition to the acm tests of specific interest to the operation of the tether is the compressibility of the epdm across the diameter of the cord this is not a standard iso test and unlike the acm tests the cross section of the sample in the radial direction is not consistent and the stiffness in this direction is related to both the material and the geometry of the sample as this is not a standard test it is not comparable to external sources however quantifying the stiffness of the sample in this direction allows for a direct comparison across the range of epdm hardness values and an understanding of how fatigue compression exposure and marine ageing of the material affect this crucial property the same procedure was followed as outlined for acm as this is not a direct calculation of material modulus this result is referred to as the radial compressive stiffness rcs the target dimensions for the rcs samples are detailed in fig 3c it should be noted that in some of the extruded epdm sections a 2 3 mm flat ridge was evident running along the length of the cord this was a product of the manufacturing extrusion process to minimise the effect of this ridge the sample was orientated ensuring the ridge was at the side and the sample was marked with a white dot to ensure consistency between sample measurements and test procedures three repeat tests were performed for both acm and rcs across the range of shore a hardness values specified 54 59 70 70 7 and 80 7 the durability aspect of this work was to ascertain whether these properties are affected by the operational requirements of the tether and a mid range epdm with shore a hardness 70 7 was selected for further testing as detailed below 2 4 2 marine exposure investigation in operation the exeter tether will be submerged in the marine environment for extended periods of time at the time of writing there is no published data regarding the stability of epdm in a submerged marine environment and this information is critical to establishing the marine durability of this elastomeric tether in service in a limited test window a widely used approach to accelerate the effect of polymer ageing in a marine environment is to immerse samples in heated sea water there is a significant amount of literature detailing the use of this approach for ageing polymers celina et al 2005 gillen et al 2005 le gac et al 2012 le saux et al 2014 scheirs 2000 wise et al 1995 a linear arrhenius extrapolation is generally used to relate the accelerated ageing conducted at elevated temperatures and extrapolate this to estimate the effects of longer term ageing at lower temperatures this relationship relates reaction rate to time and temperature through the relationship detailed in equation 3 celina et al 2005 3 k a e e a r t where k is the reaction rate a is the pre exponential factor e a is the arrhenius activation energy r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is the temperature in k from equation 3 the natural logarithm of reaction rate k can be related to the inverse of temperature 1 t via a linear relationship as detailed by celina et al 2005 degradation time t is related to reaction rate by 1 k to date there are no data available for the specific effect of marine ageing at an elevated temperature on epdm based on previous work ageing polymers le gac et al 2012 60 c was selected as an appropriate temperature to speed up the ageing process but minimise oxidation of the epdm which could result in excessive deterioration of the material epdm samples were cut to the dimensions detailed in fig 3c and immersed in natural sea water tanks as detailed in section 2 1 heated to a temperature of 60 c for a period approaching 13 months 15 05 2014 10 06 2015 regular weight measurements were recorded to monitor sample saturation immediately following removal from tanks the iso7743 test procedure was conducted as detailed in section 2 4 1 to establish the rcs following marine ageing 2 4 3 radial compression fatigue investigation during operation the tether extends and contracts to accommodate the wave induced motion of a floating body this in turn exposes the epdm core to repeated radial compression and axial extension cycles this is a durability concern for the tether as the long term consequence of these actions is unknown to investigate the potential effects of this process samples of the epdm core were subjected to repeated compression cycles and the iso7743 procedure was used to calculate the rcs of the sample following this exposure material samples were prepared to the dimensions detailed in fig 3c and set up in the mts compression test machine using a 250 kn load cell a small dot of cyanoacrylate was used to secure the underside of the cord to the mts load platen as during trials the sample had been observed slipping out of the test machine a compromise was required in specifying a frequency that maximises the number of cycles in a given test window whilst limiting the self heating of the sample a preliminary investigation into the test parameters using an infra red camera indicated that at a compressive diametral strain of 0 2 the frequency of compression cycles should be limited to 2 hz frequencies greater than this led to excessive self heating of the epdm sample with surface temperatures beyond 10 c the mts machine was set to operate in displacement mode with a diametral strain of 0 2 calculated from the average of three measurements of the cord diameter the test sample was subjected to 707 000 compression cycles to a strain of 0 2 and a frequency of 2 hz the rcs test procedure outlined in section 2 4 1 was conducted immediately following the compressive testing and at subsequent intervals to observe any time dependency in the results conducting the iso test both radially and axially on one single sample was not considered good practice as one procedure may affect the other and as the critical property of interest in this instance was the radial compressive stiffness the test was only conducted radially 3 results 3 1 assembly functionality tests following sea trials following a sea deployment approaching 6 months processed data from the fifth load up cycle of dmac functionality test ett 08 is detailed in fig 4 the secant for each line is identified in this figure between 5 and 10 kn for phase 1 and from 20 to 40 kn for phase 2 the calculated values for k d are also identified for both virgin and worked samples table 3 presents the calculated increase in dynamic stiffness observed following the swmtf deployment for each phase of operation key observations from this assessment are a measurable increase in dynamic stiffness of the tethers following the sea deployment the majority of the increase in stiffness is observed in phase 1 of operation with an increase of 54 and 110 for tethers p1 3 and p1 8 respectively additionally and perhaps more critically the stiffness profiles of the worked tethers have become more aligned settling on a similar stiffness profile as highlighted by fig 4 pre deployment during phase 1 p1 3 demonstrated a stiffness 13 greater than p1 8 however following deployment the stiffness during this phase was 15 less than p1 8 during phase 2 the difference in stiffness between p1 3 and p1 8 dropped from 17 to 6 following deployment given the design philosophy behind the tether is to establish a range of stiffness profiles this finding is very relevant and will be further addressed in the discussion section 4 3 2 tension tension assembly fatigue tests data from the tcll test is analysed to establish the evolution in dynamic axial stiffness of the tether throughout the test an example of the approach is detailed in fig 5 which highlights the analysis for the 1 50 load level and details the secants established for the calculation of k d to complement this graph table 4 details the calculated value of k d at each cycle and the change in stiffness from cycle 5 during the 1 50 load level there is an initial period of high increase in dynamic stiffness during the first 250 cycles there is an increase of 11 and 33 for phase 1 and phase 2 behaviour respectively for phase 1 the stiffness stabilises and from cycles 250 950 the stiffness increases by a further 3 whilst phase 2 stiffness increases by a further 10 during the last 250 cycles of this range the maximum increase is just 1 in both phases the same procedure was repeated for the 1 60 load level and the 1 70 load level fig 6 provides a summary for the complete tcll test series capturing the dynamic axial stiffness calculated from the secants of phase 1 and phase 2 at cycles selected from all load levels plotting the data in this way highlights that the dominant change in stiffness during this high load fatigue test occurs in phase 2 of the tether operation where the functionality is dominated by the polyester rope rather than the epdm core the drop in stiffness observed between tcll load levels is the result of adjustments required for the test set up to accommodate recovery of the tether between load levels following completion of one load level the test ends at a load of 1 nwbs however as the tether recovers it attempts to contract in length as it is fixed in the test machine the result of this is an increase in load to obtain a starting load of 1 nwbs for the subsequent load level slack must therefore be introduced into the system which results in the decrease in stiffness observed between the tcll loading levels the results in fig 6 also show a small reduction in stiffness occurring in phase 2 at the start of the 1 60 load level this could be due to the higher load level causing local damage in the rope construction or slippage within the tether construction where the hollow braided rope slips off the tether core following this initial drop however a steady increase in stiffness is observed though less pronounced than the 1 50 range with a maximum increase of 6 over the full 1000 cycles the stiffness again stabilises at higher cycle numbers results from the final load level of 1 70 demonstrate the gradual reduction in tether stiffness in phase 2 as the polyester rope yields further and approaches final failure 3 3 sub component epdm material tests 3 3 1 establishing baseline material properties a typical load strain plot from the iso7743 test procedure is detailed in fig 7 the plot reveals the full extent of the mullins effect that is observed in elastomers it is characterised by the permanent softening of the stress strain curve observed the first time a polymer is exposed to a compression or tension load cantournet et al 2009 this can be seen in fig 7 where cycle 1 requires a greater load than any subsequent cycles utilising data from the fourth load cycle for the iso calculations ensures the mullins effect does not distort the results although this effect is clearly observable during the iso7742 tests the impact of this softening is minimal in comparison to the effects from marine exposure and radial compression of the material samples in line with the iso standard the fourth data cycle for each test run is extracted and good repeatability is observed between the repeat tests for each sample condition the acm or rcs is calculated at both 0 1 and 0 2 strain using equation 2 it should be noted that the 0 strain point is determined from the point at which the curve of the last cycle meets the strain axis where force 0n this point is referred to as relative 0 strain as it is not the absolute strain value linear interpolation is again used to extract the exact values at the required points where applicable the average and standard deviation of each data set is calculated and the results can be seen in chart form in fig 8 as expected a positive correlation can be seen between shore a hardness and the calculated values for acm and rcs the observed range of stiffness values are a dominant factor controlling the variety of stiffness profiles observed in the tether assembly it is also evident that at each shore a hardness value the acm and rcs calculated at a strain of 0 2 is always higher than that calculated at a strain of 0 1 again this is intuitively expected at the higher strain level of 0 2 the sample is under greater compression and it will therefore demonstrate increased resistance to any further compression and thus a higher result for acm or rcs having established baseline values of acm and rcs across a range of shore a hardness values a mid range epdm material shore a hardness 70 7 was selected for a detailed analysis of the effect of marine ageing and fatigue compression cycles on key material properties these results are presented in the next section 3 3 2 marine exposure investigation during the marine exposure testing samples were periodically removed for weighing to observe the saturation of the samples it was anticipated that the weight of the samples would stabilise over time once fully saturated at 13 months although the rate had slowed a small amount of weight gain was still occurring fig 9 due to time limitations however the samples were removed at this point for testing following removal from the heated water the iso7743 test was repeated on the aged samples of epdm again the procedure was repeated on three samples from each range and fig 10 details the average and standard deviation of these samples in comparison with the virgin material the ageing process has significantly increased the material resistance to compression with acm increasing by 14 and 16 at strains of 0 1 and 0 2 respectively whilst rcs increased by 22 at both values of strain given the compression of the epdm core is a significant factor controlling the stiffness profile of the operating tether assembly as detailed in gordelier et al 2015 this finding has significant implications for the operation of the tether which will be further explored in the discussion 3 3 3 radial compression fatigue investigation rcs results calculated using the iso7743 approach following 707 000 compression cycles at a strain of 0 2 and a frequency of 2 hz can be seen in fig 11 these results show that the immediate rcs of the sample measured 12 min after the compression cycles does not reflect the ultimate rcs once the sample has had time to recover at the 12 min point there is not a consistent change for rcs measured at 0 1 and 0 2 strain at a strain of 0 1 rcs is 7 less than the control sample whilst at a strain of 0 2 it is 11 higher over time this difference diminishes at 42h20 the rcs is 13 and 15 higher than the average control at strains of 0 1 and 0 2 respectively iso7743 is finally repeated 66h20 after the compression cycling and provides rcs values 14 and 16 higher than the average control at strains of 0 1 and 0 2 respectively ultimately these results show that exposure to extended compression cycling at a strain of 0 2 can lead to a 15 average increased resistance to compression in comparison to the un fatigued control sample 4 discussion 4 1 assembly functionality tests following sea trials on comparing the observed increase in tether stiffness following the sea deployment to the expected performance for a conventional fibre rope the literature is inconclusive although different methods have been applied weller et al 2015b review the performance of a nylon seven parallel stranded rope and suggest a decrease in axial stiffness following an 18 month deployment at the swmtf this change in performance is attributed to mild internal abrasion damage occurring in the rope construction due to yarn on yarn wear accelerated by the ingress of particulate matter including biofouling during deployment this result is of interest in the context of synthetic ropes however it is not directly comparable to the tether polyester rope the finding from weller et al 2015b is in contrast with results presented by bitting 1980a who observes an increase in axial stiffness for both nylon and polyester ropes when exposed to the ocean environment for 4 5 years the polyester rope investigated is 8 strand plaited and double braided in construction and the dynamic stiffness increases 10 25 following the sea exposure further to this data published by rope manufacturers generally indicate an increase in stiffness for worked ropes with separate performance curves provided for new and worked ropes to inform system design typical worked graphs are published by rope manufacturer bridon bridon 2017 and demonstrate an average increase in stiffness of approximately 25 over the working range of a worked polyester rope although the precise definition of worked is not specified rope construction and material selection will significantly effect the change in stiffness observed but overall it is anticipated that in the short to medium term synthetic ropes will get stiffer with use as noted by weller et al 2015b a reduction in stiffness will be observed as the rope approaches failure particularly if the failure mechanism is fatigue given the changes observed in the stiffness profiles of worked conventional mooring ropes it is unsurprising to observe a change to the operating profile of the exeter tether prototypes following sea deployment as the outer load carrying jacket is a hollow braided polyester rope it is interesting to note however that the dominant change in the stiffness of the worked tethers following sea deployment occurs during phase 1 of operation which is dominated by the compression of the epdm core as outlined in section 1 1 the average increase in stiffness following deployment of both tethers for phase 1 is 82 in contrast to phase 2 with an average increase of 8 during the exeter tether operation although phase 1 is dominated by the epdm core material properties the increase in stiffness of the load carrying polyester rope will have an impact on tether operation across both phase 1 and phase 2 the design concept of the p1 tether series utilises a standard braided rope jacket with a range of different polymer core specifications to achieve a variety of axial stiffness responses as demonstrated in gordelier et al 2015 therefore of interest is the observed reduction in operating range of the post deployment tethers given achieving this stiffness range was one of the key design intentions for the p1 tether series results from epdm material testing indicate an increase in stiffness of the epdm material which would certainly lead to an alteration in overall tether stiffness profile these results are discussed in more detail in sections 4 3 and 4 4 of relevance to these tether assembly tests and the controlled assembly fatigue tests discussed in the next section is the stiffness of standard polyester mooring lines and this behaviour in relation to average load and load amplitude expanding upon earlier work by bitting et al 1980b investigations with a 12 strand parallel laid polyester rope presented by fernandes et al 1999 demonstrate there is an increase in stiffness proportional to the average load applied and a decrease in stiffness proportional to the load amplitude with a limited effect from loading frequency this work has been confirmed and further developed by davies et al 2002 who also demonstrate a stiffness dependence on mean load and load range for both aramid and hmpe ropes these observations are further supported by weller et al 2014b and weller et al 2015b to establish the change in tether stiffness observed pre and post swmtf deployment identical functionality test ett 08 was repeated this is a displacement driven test so small variations in the peak load of the fifth cycle are observable however the stiffness profiles are calculated at consistent loads for each sample 5 10 kn for phase 1 and 20 40 kn for phase 2 comparing the stiffness profiles in this respect should minimise the variation brought about by an increase in average load the main limitation of the tether assembly test work is due to the limited number of samples available and the large investment required for sea deployments with the high costs involved at the early stage of prototype development the total number of tethers manufactured for the p1 series was limited to 13 and no two tethers were identical given the scope of test work required from this first set of prototypes it was not possible to conduct repeat sea tests on multiple samples results should therefore be considered to give an indication of performance trends rather than definitive values for stiffness profiles 4 2 tension tension assembly fatigue tests the tcll fatigue endurance tests performed in fresh water highlight the increase in dynamic axial stiffness of the tether when subject to high load fatigue cycling in addition to the increase of the individual cycle dynamic stiffness an overall increase in sample length is measured this extension is observed in conventional fibre ropes and is due to both the permanent bedding in of the rope and end terminations material and constructional reorientation and stretch creep and visco elastic stretch which are accumulated during tension cycles flory et al 2004 work conducted on polyester fibres attributes an element of both the permanent and recoverable strain to the macromolecular rearrangement of entanglements and orientation of crystallites chailleux and davies 2005 further to this davies et al 2000 state that the majority of permanent bedding in strain is due to the material behaviour and not the rope construction for long lay length polyester mooring lines indeed the extent of the permanent stretch in polyester mooring ropes leads to a common practice of pre stretching ropes during installation to minimise future adjustments required to the mooring system deandrade and duggal 2010 regarding the recoverable element of the strain in conventional fibre rope testing recovery of the accumulated elastic stretch and visco elastic stretch is anticipated when the tension cycles stop however in the tether the time dependency of this recovery is particularly pronounced due to the additional recovery of the epdm core which takes on a temporary compression set during cyclical loading to accommodate this recovery adjustments to the dmac set up led to a perceived drop in axial stiffness as observed between load level cycles detailed in fig 6 the significance of the observed compression set is caused by the high loading levels used in the tcll test up to 70 mbl in this case critics of the tcll test procedure claim the high loading levels render it unrepresentative of the final application davies et al 2012 certainly this time dependant recovery would be much less perceptible at the typical operating range of the tether it should also be noted that the high level of loading in the tcll test procedure accelerates any wear mechanisms occurring the reduction in stiffness and final failure of the tether observed at the end of the tcll test in fig 6 would be more gradual under typical operating conditions weller et al 2014b analysed the performance of a conventional nylon rope with a parallel stranded sub rope construction during cyclical loading and found that the axial stiffness stabilises from 25 cycles in comparison to the results for the tether significant evolution is still occurring at 25 cycles which suggests that due to the novel construction of the tether establishing a stabilised axial stiffness profile during cyclical loading may take longer than for conventional fibre ropes it should be noted however that the tcll test presented here subjected the tether to significantly higher loading levels than testing presented in weller et al 2014b as discussed in section 4 1 previous work has shown some stiffness dependency on both mean load and load amplitude for standard polyester ropes fernandes et al 1999 davies et al 2002 weller et al 2014b 2015b given the increase in mean load between the tcll testing load levels it might be anticipated that an overall increase in stiffness would be observed between loading levels however due to a combination of the drop in stiffness due to adjustments between loading levels the mild reduction in stiffness at the start of the 1 60 loading level and the final failure occurring early in the 1 70 loading level no such overall increase is observed it is interesting to note however that the significant increase in stiffness observed during the tcll test series occurs in phase 2 of operation as shown in fig 5 and table 4 where the tether behaviour is dominated by the polyester rope as opposed to the epdm core 4 3 marine exposure investigation results from iso7743 testing conducted following a period of marine ageing demonstrate an average increase in sample stiffness of 15 and 22 for acm and rcs respectively to put these results into context within the range of epdm shore a hardness values specified in the p1 series fig 12 has been included this figure demonstrates that although the acm and rcs have increased following marine ageing the change has not been significant enough to alter the order of the specified epdm with the aged 70 7 still having acm and rcs values higher than for epdm 70 and lower than epdm 80 there are various mechanisms which can contribute to changes in mechanical behaviour of elastomers after wet ageing reversible mechanisms include plasticization and swelling irreversible effects include hydrolysis leaching of additives such as plasticizers and oxidation these last two and possibly swelling will tend to result in increasing stiffness while plasticization and hydrolysis may reduce it more work including physico chemical analysis is under way to identify the specific mechanisms which are involved here it should be noted that although establishing the value for acm followed the standard iso test procedure with a scaled sample size the quantification of rcs is not a standard material test the results for this are affected by both the material property and the sample geometry this test was created specifically for the tether work presented as the diametric compression behaviour of the epdm cord is of critical importance to operation of the tether controlling the axial stiffness profile during phase 1 of operation thus the rcs result is not a standard material property that can be specified but the presented work provides a better understanding of how this key property changes when the material is subject to realistic operating parameters limitations of this work revolve around the assumption that immersing epdm samples in heated sea water will accurately accelerate the natural ageing process in line with arrhenius behaviour although this technique is widely used celina et al 2005 davies and evrard 2007 le saux et al 2014 le gac et al 2012 scheirs 2000 wise et al 1995 it does have limitations with critics concerned that using temperature to accelerate the ageing process may introduce failure mechanisms that would not have occurred through natural ageing at a more representative operational temperature davies and evrard 2007 the work presented here uses one temperature 60 c to accelerate the marine ageing process assuming that an arrhenius relationship applies for epdm given the apparent implications for the material properties of the epdm samples tested an extension to this work is underway to conduct further testing over a range of different temperatures to confirm these findings and to accurately establish the arrhenius relationship for epdm further to this fatigue testing of samples in natural seawater will be conducted to establish the implications of concurrent exposure to fatigue cycling and the marine environment 4 4 radial compression fatigue investigation the long term effect of the fatigue compression cycling is an average 15 increase in rcs which was measured following 66 h of recovery however it is interesting to note that immediately after cycling the rcs is lower gradually increasing and stabilising over time with minimal change occurring between 42 and 66 h these compression test parameters represent a realistic if conservative loading scenario assembly tether testing observed radial compressive strains exceeding 0 35 during anticipated extreme conditions therefore exposing the epdm cord to fatigue compression at a strain of 0 2 during this test schedule certainly represents a genuine operational demand further to this assuming a typical wave period of 8 s 707 000 cycles represent just 65 days of operation to put this observed change of rcs into context within the range of specified epdm hardness values fig 13 has been included this figure demonstrates that despite increasing the rcs of the material the fatigued 70 7 epdm remains in consecutive order of increasing rcs with increasing shore a hardness a potential limitation for this section of work revolves around the validity of these results due to the temperature increase of the samples when under compression cycling to investigate this further detailed testing was conducted observing the temperature increase in samples when subjected to repeated compression cycles at a range of frequencies and to a varying degree of compressive strain measurable temperature increases were observed when subjecting samples to high frequency or high strain compression cycles for example at a strain of 0 2 and a frequency of 5 hz surface temperature increases peaking over 13 c were observed more significantly at a strain of 0 5 and a frequency of 2 hz surface temperature increases in excess of 35 c were observed at the centre of the sample core cross section the experimental parameters for the compression testing presented in this paper are based on a strain of 0 2 and a frequency of 2 hz observed surface temperature differentials using these parameters remain below 9 c and are therefore considered to have a minimal effect on results this temperature increase may have affected the radial compressive stiffness calculated immediately following compression testing fig 11 but should have limited effect on the longer term measured compressive stiffness values 4 5 overall discussion considering all these findings in the context of overall tether implications a pattern of increased stiffness when exposed to the marine environment and or cyclical loading is established findings from the material tests are not directly comparable to the assembly scale tests however they do offer insights into what is causing the observed changes in tether assembly behaviour the findings from the iso7743 tests following either marine ageing or radial compression fatigue of the epdm core material demonstrate an increased material resistance to compression this supports the observed increase in tether stiffness during phase 1 of tether operation following sea trials where the core will have been subject to both the marine environment and radial compression fatigue to understand the relative contribution of different aspects of the material testing to the tether assembly performance the iso7743 material findings were plotted within the context of the range of hardness values of the epdm utilised in the p1 series prototype range in figs 12 and 13 these figures demonstrate that although significant neither the marine ageing or radial compression fatigue testing shifted the order of the acm or rcs across the range of epdm shore hardness values tested the conclusion from this is that there are multiple factors leading to the increase in stiffness observed in the aged tether assemblies following sea deployment this includes changes to both the epdm material radial compressive stiffness caused by marine ageing and repeated radial compression of the core through the extension of the tether during operation and the overall increase in stiffness of the polyester rope as observed in conventional polyester ropes bitting 1980a bridon 2017 the work presented in this paper seeks to establish an understanding of the long term behaviour of the tether under typical operating parameters and does not address final failure mechanisms or fatigue failure rates to establish a specific t n curve for the tether would require a substantial test programme beyond the scope of work presented here and of limited use at this prototype stage the polyester rope is the predominant load carrier within the tether and existing t n curves for polyester rope flory and banfield 2006 can be used for fatigue estimation and design of mooring systems thies et al 2014 the improved operating stiffness profile offered by the exeter tether will reduce both peak and fatigue loads throughout the mooring system with parish et al 2017 estimating a peak load reduction of approximately 70 these load reductions should be considered when designing a floating system incorporating the tether as there are benefits that go beyond the mooring system including a potential reduction in the required size of the floating body 5 conclusions and next steps the p1 series of tether prototypes were developed to prove the design concept of the exeter tether the durability of this series was not a primary objective therefore the work presented in this paper offers some initial insights into key durability considerations for the p1 series in order to inform future design iterations controlled testing of the tether assembly following a sea deployment approaching 6 months demonstrates a measurable increase in dynamic axial stiffness with an average 82 and 8 increase in phase 1 and 2 of operation respectively critically this field deployment demonstrates that for the two samples investigated the diversity in stiffness profiles observed in the virgin tethers is reduced following a period of sea deployment as the range of stiffness profiles is a key operating principle for the tether design further work is required to establish if this reduction is observed across the full suite of tethers work is also ongoing utilising numerical models to estimate the load exposure of the tether prototypes during the swmtf deployment and to establish the reduction in peak mooring loads achieved through tether placement within the mooring system the controlled assembly fatigue testing of tether p1 16 also highlighted the increase in dynamic axial stiffness upon working the maximum increase of 42 was observed during the first loading level of 1 50 nwbs in the phase 2 secant this testing demonstrated the increase in stiffness stabilises over time reaching a natural limit it is suggested that for each tether design a minimum of 500 cycles at typical operating loads is used to ascertain a working stiffness profile for use in mooring system design the dynamics of the floating system and the resulting peak and fatigue mooring loads will be significantly affected by the mooring stiffness profile establishing the worked operating profiles of the tether assembly is of central importance to inform mooring systems designed to incorporate the tether in addition to tether assembly testing detailed material tests of the epdm core material established an increase in material stiffness when exposed to operational parameters including the marine environment and repeated compression cycles average increases in rcs of 22 and 15 were observed following marine ageing and exposure to fatigue compression cycles respectively prior to this work the effect of these parameters on epdm was unknown this information will therefore be useful to anyone intending to utilise epdm in a marine environment or an application where it is repeatedly exposed to compressive strain breaking the overall assembly down and conducting sub component tests as presented in this paper allows a greater understanding of causality regarding the observed changes in the tether assembly operation going forward it also creates an opportunity to investigate alternative materials more efficiently without the need to construct full tether assemblies for each iteration this general approach combining both field and laboratory experimentation to identify and investigate particular durability aspects of a novel component is particularly relevant for the offshore technology sector field work in this sector involves high operational costs and although it is certainly necessary to prove components in the field identifying opportunities for laboratory based testing to develop particular aspects of component investigation has shown to be an effective supplement to the field based work bringing all aspects of the work presented here together the assembly tether testing and epdm material testing corroborate one another all indicating an increased tether axial stiffness as a result of exposure to operating conditions marine ageing and low level loading from the sea deployment is found to significantly affect the stiffness during phase 1 of tether operation whilst high level fatigue loading has a greater impact on phase 2 of the tether stiffness profile the key objectives for the tether development are to increase the compliance of the mooring system and allow the specification of an axial stiffness optimised for a specific device and location whilst the tether successfully increases the overall compliance of the system as demonstrated in gordelier et al 2015 and parish et al 2017 this work has shown that the evolution of the tether stiffness profile during operation must be taken into account when designing a mooring system incorporating the exeter tether following these findings work has continued to further investigate the affect of marine ageing on epdm in addition opera a european union horizon 2020 project has commissioned the development of up scaled tether prototypes including the p3 series and the full scale p4 series which will be deployed in the bay of biscay spain the p4 tether will replace a conventional polyester rope on selected limbs of the karratu shared mooring system securing the marmok a 5 wave energy device weller et al 2017 mooring load data from this deployment will allow an assessment of the load reductions achievable with this novel mooring system and

23506,in present paper a hybrid analytical numerical approach is developed to investigate vibration characteristics of a finite cylindrical shell with interior structures e g plates and other complicated structures the cylindrical shell is analyzed through exact wave based method wbm flügge theory is adopted to describe motion equations of the shell and displacement functions are expressed as wave functions interior structures are modelled by means of finite element method fem and coupled to the shell through the artificial spring technique by allowing a wide variation range of spring stiffness constants different coupling conditions between the shell and interior structures can be easily simulated comparisons of results individually obtained from this hybrid method and fem demonstrate the high accuracy of the hybrid method some numerical examples are given herein to further study effects of coupling conditions and boundary conditions on vibration responses of the shell with interior structures keywords cylindrical shells with interior structures hybrid analytical numerical method vibration analysis elastic coupling conditions 1 introduction cylindrical shells are widely used as basic components to simulate aerospace submarine and pipe structures and so forth over the past few decades considerable attention has been paid to investigating vibration characteristics of cylindrical shells and most of these works were well documented in the publications leissa 1993 qatu 2002a 2002b in practical engineering applications various irregular shaped facilities may be mounted inside the hull nevertheless the majority of literature were concerned with pure cylindrical shells bert and malik 1996 stanley and ganesan 1995 xiang et al 2002 zhang and xiang 2007 and shells with simple attachments such as ring stiffeners wah and hu 1968 mustafa and ali 1989 jafari and bagheri 2006 circular plates smith and haft 1967 cheng and nicolas 1992 as well as longitudinal floors missaoui et al 1996 wang et al 2004 due to the difficulty in modelling and solution process it is laborious to study vibrations of complicated structures through theoretical methods as a discretization approach fem is a powerful tool to approximately deal with structural vibration problems one advantage of fem is the ability to model complex structures which can t be dealt with by analytical methods however to ensure the accuracy of fem results the number of elements will increase sharply as the frequency increases which seriously reduces computational efficiency and increases storage space therefore in terms of the cylindrical shell with interior structures developing an efficient approach which combines advantages of the analytical method and numerical method is meaningful unfortunately owing to the complexity involved in the coupling of the two methods the number of researches on structural vibrations utilizing the hybrid analytical numerical approach is rather limited to the authors best knowledge there are some but not many literature concerning structure vibrations by means of the hybrid method grice and pinnington 2000a investigated forced vibration characteristics of a beam stiffened plate the complete structure was divided into two independent parts namely a beam and a plate the beam was analyzed by fem while the plate was modelled using analytical impedances grice and pinnington 2000b the two components were eventually coupled together through a standard sub structuring procedure in a subsequent study grice and pinnington 2002 the hybrid method was used to study flexural vibrations of a thin plate box and the results were validated by laboratory measurements li et al 2014 developed a hybrid finite element fourier spectral method to analyze free vibrations of beams and plates based on energy principle the analytical and numerical domains which were respectively studied through fourier spectral method and fem were coupled by introducing artificial springs ettouney et al 1994 investigated vibrational and acoustical characteristics of a submerged cylindrical shell with two hemispherical end closures and an interior beam a finite difference method was adopted to model the shell and the beam was tackled using fem however ignoring rotations only continuity conditions in three translational directions were considered at the coupling point of the shell and the beam zou 2014 studied forced vibrations of an underwater cylindrical shell with an inner base the mode superposition method and fem were adopted to analyze the shell and the base respectively continuity conditions at coupling points were utilized to couple the two substructures nevertheless as a result of trigonometric functions being chosen as axial displacement functions only the simply supported cylindrical shell was taken into account maxit and ginoux 2010 proposed a substructure method called the circumferential admittance approach caa to predict vibro acoustic behavior of a submerged cylindrical shell non periodically stiffened by axisymmetric interior frames stiffeners bulkheads hemispherical end caps and so on the shell was solved in the wavenumber domain interior frames were tackled adopting axisymmetric fem and coupled to the shell in three translational directions and tangential rotation caa was also used to predict scattering pressure of the similar model in a succeeding study maxit 2014 as an extension of caa the condensed transfer functions ctf method meyer et al 2016 was subsequently developed to consider not only axisymmetric frames but also non axisymmetric ones ctf and caa were combined to study vibrations and acoustics of cylindrical shells with more complicated interior frames however it was a remarkable fact that non axisymmetric frames were connected to axisymmetric frames which were still coupled to the shell in four degrees of freedom dofs with the couplings in axial and radial rotations being neglected from the aforementioned review some researchers were devoted to combining theoretical methods and numerical methods for vibration analysis of complicated structures as for the cylindrical shell with interior attachments the couplings between the shell and attachments were insufficient ettouney et al 1994 meyer et al 2016 i e only three or four dofs were considered recently wave based method which has been adopted by the research group of authors to investigate vibrations of cylindrical shells wei et al 2013 chen et al 2015 xie et al 2017a was extended to establish governing equations of the shell coupled with interior structures in six dofs zhang et al 2017 unfortunately similar to the cited publications ettouney et al 1994 zou 2014 maxit and ginoux 2010 maxit 2014 meyer et al 2016 interior attachments were still rigidly connected to the shell in authors previous study zhang et al 2017 in practical applications the shell and attachments may be joined together by welds or bolts however due to welding defects or bolt looseness displacement continuity may not be perfectly achieved at junctions what s more there are some machines elastically mounted in the hull under these circumstances rigid couplings are not applicable as a consequence developing a method dealing with the elastic couplings between the shell and interior attachments is necessary in this paper a hybrid approach combining wbm and fem is presented to investigate vibration characteristics of a cylindrical shell coupled with interior structures the whole structure is decomposed into the independent shell and interior attachments which are analyzed through wbm and fem respectively flügge theory is used to establish motion equations of the shell and wave functions which are the essence of wbm are utilized as admissible displacement functions artificial spring technique is adopted to couple the two substructures in three translational directions and three rotations moreover as a special case rigid coupling conditions can be taken into account by assigning stiffness constants of artificial springs as a very large value xie et al 2017b several numerical examples are given to demonstrate the accuracy of present hybrid method and effects of coupling conditions as well as boundary conditions are further studied the hybrid analytical numerical approach developed in this paper is believed to include following novelties first the present method combines advantages of wbm and fem for vibration analysis of cylindrical shells with various interior structures second in contrast with the simplified processing method in literature more accurate continuity conditions between the shell and interior structures are considered by present method which is appropriate to arbitrary coupling conditions third present hybrid method shows great potential in variable parameters analysis for optimization for instance if properties of interior structures are modified there is no need to reanalyze the cylindrical shell and computation time can thus be saved 2 theoretical formulations in present paper the interior structures attached to the cylindrical shell are modelled by fem thus no limit existing in the geometric shape of interior structures in other words both simple plates and complicated structures can be analyzed for illustrative purposes a simplified base is adopted it should be known that the interior structure is not only restricted to a base and it is just a representative case due to the discretization of fem the displacement field of the base is discrete as a result line connections between the shell and the base are simulated by artificial spring systems distributed at coupling points along the junctions the shell base system and the corresponding global cylindrical co ordinate system o r θ x are schematically illustrated in fig 1 the derivation process is divided into three parts in section 2 1 based on wbm the displacement receptance functions at coupling points under coupling excitation and external excitation on the shell are derivated in section 2 2 the dynamic equations of the base are obtained by fem in section 2 3 the shell and the base are coupled together through artificial springs and the governing equations of the shell base system are established 2 1 equations of the shell 2 1 1 motion equations and admissible displacement functions the cylindrical shell is made of the isotropic and elastic material with young s modulus e s poisson s ratio υ s and density ρ s the damping is introduced by replacing young s modulus e s with a complex one e s e s 1 i η s where η s is the material loss factor l r and h are the length the radius and the thickness respectively based on wbm the cylindrical shell is divided into shell segments according to axial positions of excitations the local co ordinate system o r θ x is adopted for one segment to establish the governing equations as shown in fig 2 u v and w are the orthogonal components of displacement in axial circumferential and radial directions ϕ w x is the slope n is the axial force resultant m is the bending moment resultant t and s represent the circumferential and lateral kelvin kirchhoff shear force resultants respectively on the basis of flügge shell theory motion equations of a thin cylindrical segment can be expressed as flügge 1973 1 l 11 u l 12 v l 13 w 0 l 21 u l 22 v l 23 w 0 l 31 u l 32 v l 33 w 0 where flügge differential operators l i j i j 1 2 3 of the cylindrical shell are given in appendix a the displacement functions of cylindrical shell can be expressed in terms of wave functions leissa 1993 2 u u s u a n 0 n m 1 8 u n m s e j λ n m s x cos n θ u n m a e j λ n m

where superscripts s and a correspond to symmetric and anti symmetric circumferential modes respectively λ n m s and λ n m a are axial wavenumbers j represents the imaginary unit ω is the angular frequency n is the truncated circumferential mode number for a given circumferential mode number n substituting symmetric anti symmetric wave functions into eq 1 three linear equations in terms of contribution coefficients u n m s v n m s and w n m s u n m a v n m a and w n m a are obtained correspondingly λ n m s λ n m a can be determined by setting the determinant of the equations to zero the relationships of contribution coefficients are written as ξ n m s u n m s w n m s and η n m s v n m s w n m s ξ n m a u n m a w n m a and η n m a v n m a w n m a for each axial wavenumber λ n m s λ n m a substituting eq 2 into expressions of force resultants which are given in appendix a and omitting e j ω t one obtains the following displacements and force resultants at the cross section of the cylindrical segment 3 u v w ϕ n t s m v τ n 0 n c s n s d n s f n s w n s τ c s n a d n a f n a w n a τ where 4 c s n s d i a g cos n θ sin n θ cos n θ cos n θ cos n θ sin n θ cos n θ cos n θ 5 c s n a d i a g sin n θ cos n θ sin n θ sin n θ sin n θ cos n θ sin n θ sin n θ 6 w n s w n 1 s w n 2 s w n 3 s w n 4 s w n 5 s w n 6 s w n 7 s w n 8 s 7 w n a w n 1 a w n 2 a w n 3 a w n 4 a w n 5 a w n 6 a w n 7 a w n 8 a in eq 3 the matrices vectors respectively corresponding to symmetric and anti symmetric circumferential modes have the same forms for clarity of derivation only d n s and f n s corresponding to the symmetric circumferential mode are expressed in appendix a 2 1 2 boundary and continuity conditions with regard to boundary conditions of the shell both classical and elastic ones can be taken into consideration by introducing artificial springs the resulting expressions are as follows 8 k u u n 0 k v v t 0 k w w s 0 k ϕ ϕ m v 0 where indicates the boundary at the right end and denotes the boundary at the left end k u k v k w and k ϕ are the stiffness constants of springs in different directions through assigning different spring constants arbitrary boundary conditions can be obtained for instance the classical free and fixed boundaries are simulated by assigning spring constants as zero and a very large value respectively apart from boundary conditions continuity conditions of adjacent segments need to be taken into account the cylindrical shell is assumed to be divided into p segments displacements and force resultants at the cross sections of the i th and i 1 th i 1 p 1 segments are illustrated in fig 3 and geometrical compatibility and force equilibrium conditions at the junction are expressed as follows 9 u i r u i 1 l v i r v i 1 l w i r w i 1 l ϕ i r ϕ i 1 l 10 n i r n i 1 l t i r t i 1 l s i r s i 1 l m v i r m v i 1 l 2 1 3 excitations as concentrated excitations are applied on the shell modifications are necessary for the force equilibrium conditions expressed in eq 10 assuming that the global coordinate of an excitation is r θ 0 x 0 the excitation with amplitude f 0 is described in terms of dirac delta functions as 11 f f 0 δ x x 0 δ θ θ 0 r where 12 f 0 f u f v f w m u m v m w τ generally as for thin cylindrical shells four displacements and four force resultants are adopted to describe the boundary conditions of the shell in consequence the continuity conditions at the junction of two shell segments consist of four displacement compatibility equations and four force equilibrium equations as given in eqs 9 and 10 nevertheless with regard to common beam element and shell element in fem there are six dofs at each node apparently it seems difficult to couple interior structures with the shell in six dofs at each coupling point and this may be the reason that only three dofs were considered at the coupling point in the literature ettouney et al 1994 to obtain more realistic and reasonable coupling conditions between the shell and interior structures m u and m w are worth being taken into consideration which will be discussed in the following analysis in present paper as shown in fig 4 the two moments are converted to equivalent couples 13 f 1 a m u 14 f 2 a m w where a is the arm of couples if a is small enough the moment and its equivalent couple will have the same driving effects herein sin θ a 2 r 10 4 supposing that the excitation is located at the junction of the i th and i 1 th segments the force equilibrium conditions are modified as 15 n i r n i 1 l f u r t i r t i 1 l f v r s i r s i 1 l f w r m i r m i 1 l m v r where 16 f u f u δ x x 0 δ θ θ 0 f 2 δ x x 0 δ θ θ 0 θ f 2 δ x x 0 δ θ θ 0 θ f v f v δ x x 0 δ θ θ 0 f 1 sin θ δ x x 0 δ θ θ 0 θ f 1 sin θ δ x x 0 δ θ θ 0 θ f w f w δ x x 0 δ θ θ 0 f 1 cos θ δ x x 0 δ θ θ 0 θ f 1 cos θ δ x x 0 δ θ θ 0 θ m v m v δ x x 0 δ θ θ 0 multiplying eq 15 by cos n θ or sin n θ and taking the integral from 0 to 2 π eq 15 can be simplified and written in matrix form as 17 f n s x l i f n s x 0 t n s f 0 18 f n a x l i f n a x 0 t n a f 0 where l i i 1 p 1 is the length of the i th shell segment t n s and t n a are excitation transfer matrices and detailed elements of t n s are given in appendix b 2 1 4 receptance functions excitations applied on the shell are divided into two parts one is the external excitation f s e and the other is coupling excitation f s c distributed at coupling points assuming that the number of coupling points is b the corresponding dimension of vector f s c is 6 b 1 similarly the dimension of vector f s e is 6 c 1 which depends on the number of external driving points c assembling boundary and modified continuity conditions eqs 8 9 and 17 18 the governing equations are established and expressed in matrix form as 19 k n w n τ t n f s e f s c where 20 w n w n 1 s w n i s w n p s w n 1 a w n i a w n p a k n is the generalized stiffness matrix while t n is the global excitation transfer matrix detailed expressions of k n and t n are shown in appendix b from eq 19 the relationship between contribution coefficients w n and f s e as well as f s c can be written as 21 w n τ k n 1 t n f s e f s c it should be clearly recognized that only three displacement components u v w and rotation ϕ are expressed above whereas rotations α and β respectively in directions x and r are essential for the shell to couple with interior structures and they are expressed as zhang et al 2014 22 α 1 r v w θ 23 β 1 2 u r θ v x once w n is determined the receptance functions displacements x s e on all the six dofs at external driving points and x s c at coupling points under f s e and f s c can be easily obtained 24 x s e x s c n 0 n r n 1 r n 2 w n τ n 0 n r n 1 r n 2 k n 1 t n f s e f s c d 11 d 12 d 21 d 22 f s e f s c where r n 1 and r n 2 are the displacement transfer matrices corresponding to locations of excitations and the detailed elements are given in appendix c 2 2 equations of interior structures the hybrid approach presented in this paper is aimed at investigating vibration characteristics of the cylindrical shell with interior structures in order to widen the scope of application of present method an approximate but widely used method fem is adopted to model interior structures with the material loss factor η b being introduced to the stiffness matrix k b k b 1 i η b motion equations of interior structures are expressed as 25 ω 2 m b k b x b f b where x b is the vector of dofs f b is the force vector m b and k b are the mass and stiffness matrices respectively on the purpose of decreasing the scale of governing equations and improving the computational efficiency kuhar dynamic reduction method kuhar and stahle 1974 is utilized to reduce the size of mass and stiffness matrices the essence of kuhar reduction is to divide the whole dofs into two parts one is the master dofs x b m forced by external excitations or located on the junctions between the shell and the base and the other is the slave dofs x b s as a result eq 25 can be rewritten as 26 ω 2 m b m m m b m s m b s m m b s s k b m m k b m s k b s m k b s s x b m x b s f b m 0 according to the second equation in eq 26 that is 27 ω 2 m b s m m b s s k b s m k b s s x b m x b s 0 the relationship of x b s and x b m can be derivated as follows 28 x b s k b s s ω 2 m b s s 1 k b s m ω 2 m b s m x b m substituting eq 28 into the first equation in eq 26 the resulting motion equations are 29 z b x b m f b m where 30 z b k b m m ω 2 m b m m k b m s ω 2 m b m s k b s s ω 2 m b s s 1 k b s m ω 2 m b s m the master dofs x b m can be divided into two parts 31 x b m x b e x b c where x b e and x b c correspond to dofs at external driving points and coupling points respectively correspondingly eq 29 is re expressed as 32 z b 11 z b 12 z b 21 z b 22 x b e x b c f b e f b c where f b e is external excitation vector and f b c represents coupling excitation vector 2 3 coupling of the shell and interior structures artificial spring technique is introduced to couple the shell and the base taking one coupling point for example the six springs are illustrated in fig 5 and they are written in matrix form as follows 33 k d i a g k u k v k w k α k ϕ k β at coupling points force equilibrium conditions are necessary and the relationship between f s c applied on the shell and f b c applied on interior structures is expressed as follows 34 f s c f b c on the other hand the relationship between displacements and forces at coupling points can be described as 35 f s c k x b c x s c where k d i a g k 1 k 2 k b 1 k b the subscripts 1 2 b 1 b correspond to coupling points assembling the receptance functions of shell eq 24 reduced dynamic equations of interior structures eq 32 and coupling conditions eqs 34 and 35 after straightforward mathematical derivation the final governing equations are established 36 z b 11 z b 12 d 22 k 1 z b 21 z b 22 d 22 k 1 i x b e f s c f b e z b 12 d 21 f s e z b 22 d 21 f s e once f s c is determined by solving eq 36 the vibration responses of the cylindrical shell can be easily calculated as mentioned above different coupling conditions can be simulated by setting spring constants to appropriate values for example if all spring constants are large enough the all elements of k 1 will approach zero then eq 36 can be regarded as governing equations of the rigidly coupled shell base system 3 results and analysis 3 1 convergence and validity analysis of present method a cylindrical shell and base system is employed to check the validity and accuracy of present method the geometrical dimensions of the shell are the length l 9 6 m the radius r 3 5 m and the thickness h 0 028 m the dimensions of the base are the length 4 8 m from x 2 4 m to x 7 2 m the width 2 m the height 1 2 m the thickness of panel 0 056 m and the thickness of web 0 052 m besides the shell and the base are made of the same material young s modulus 210 gpa poisson s ratio 0 3 density 7850 kg m 3 and loss factor 0 01 without otherwise specification the geometry and material properties keep unchanged in the following analysis the external point force f 1 is located at the center of the panel of the base and is perpendicular to the panel the amplitude of f 1 is 1 n and the range of analysis frequency varies from 1 hz to 200 hz with step 1 hz first of all the convergence of present method for vibration responses is discussed the shell is clamped at both ends through setting k u k v k w and k ϕ to a very large value 10 16 similarly stiffness constants of artificial springs distributed at junctions between the shell and base are also assigned as 10 16 to simulate rigid coupling conditions the hybrid approach developed in this paper consists of two methods one is wbm for the shell and the other is fem for interior structures consequently convergence of both wbm and fem should be firstly discussed and three cases will be considered to check the validity and accuracy the results of present approach are compared with those fully calculated by the finite element software ansys in which shell181 elements are used for the finite element discretization of the shell base system there s no doubt that convergence of fem is essential and three kinds of meshes with different sizes are designed the three cases and three meshes are shown in table 1 in the table n is the truncated circumferential mode number of wbm while m s means the mesh size of fem in this section the displacement response and mean quadratic velocity mqv of the cylindrical shell are presented in db as follow 37 l d 20 lg d a m p 10 12 38 l m q v 10 lg v 2 10 18 v 2 1 s s h e l l v r θ x 2 d s in eq 37 d a m p represents the amplitude of displacement in eq 38 s s h e l l is the area of the cylindrical shell fig 6 gives the normal displacement response at the driving point and mqv of the shell as f 1 considered under the three cases it is clearly observed that results of case 3 are different from those of case 1 and case2 and results of case 1 and case 2 are almost identical as a consequence the truncated circumferential mode number n is set to 30 and the mesh size of the inner base is 0 075 m in the following analysis on the other hand the length of flexural wave cremer et al 2005 in flat plate is 39 λ b π 2 e 3 ρ 1 υ 2 4 h 1 f where e ρ and υ are young s modulus density and poisson s ratio respectively h 1 is the thickness of the plate and f is the analysis frequency corresponding to h 1 0 052 m and f 200 hz the shortest wavelength of flexural wave is λ b min 1 599 m as the mesh size is 0 075 m there are at least 21 elements per wavelength fig 7 shows the normal displacement and mqv of the shell as f 1 considered under the three kinds of meshes given in table 1 it can be observed that results of mesh 3 are discrepant with results of mesh 1 and mesh 2 as analysis frequency increases and differences between results of mesh 1 and mesh 2 are little as a result the mesh size of the finite element model is chosen as 0 075 m comparisons of vibration responses calculated by present method and fem are presented in fig 8 as can be observed the results of present hybrid method agree well with those calculated by fem which demonstrates the high accuracy of present method 3 2 effects of coupling conditions on vibration responses 3 2 1 rigid coupling conditions as mentioned in the introduction coupling conditions between the shell and interior structures are insufficient in some literature ettouney et al 1994 meyer et al 2016 and only three or four degrees of freedom at junctions are considered in this section effects of coupling conditions on vibration responses are investigated it should be noted that u v and w are axial circumferential and radial displacements while α ϕ and β are axial circumferential and radial rotations respectively the normal displacement at the driving point and mqv of the shell under different coupling conditions as f 1 considered are shown in fig 9 in which all means all the six dofs are coupled k u k v k w k α k ϕ k β 10 16 and k u 1 for example means dof u is uncoupled whereas the remaining five dofs are coupled k u 1 k v k w k α k ϕ k β 10 16 for sake of avoiding the singularity of matrix k k u is set as 1 rather than 0 in order to further compare effects of each dof on vibration responses shown in fig 9 the relative difference rd is defined as 40 r d l k 1 l a l l l a l l where the subscripts k 1 k k u k v k w k α k ϕ k β and all correspond to vibration responses under insufficient and sufficient coupling conditions respectively the greater the absolute of rd the greater the effects of one dof on vibration responses fig 10 gives the curves of relative difference under different coupling conditions as f 1 considered obviously couplings on dof v dof w and dof α have significant influences on vibration responses to further study effects of coupling conditions on vibration responses excitations in different directions will be considered the direction of f 1 is changed to the axial and circumferential directions and they are defined as f 2 and f 3 respectively vibration responses of the shell base system as well as the relative difference individually driven by f 2 and f 3 are shown in figs 11 14 as can be seen coupling on dof u has negligible influence on vibrations as f 1 considered but the influence becomes obvious as f 2 considered the reason is that the direction of axial force f 2 is the same as dof u among the three forces no matter which one is applied on the shell base system couplings on dof w and dof α have significant effects on vibration responses it can be attributed to the difference of the stiffness on different dofs at coupling points as to the shell bending stiffness on dof w is much smaller than in plane stiffness on dof u and v dof α and dof ϕ both correspond to the bending stiffness on the shell but dof ϕ is concerned with the in plane shear stiffness on the base which results in the little influence of the coupling on dof ϕ at last it can be concluded that effects of one dof at coupling points on vibration responses depend on the stiffness and force on the dof the larger the coupling force is and the smaller the stiffness is the greater the effects on vibration responses become consequently to obtain more accurate prediction of vibration responses it is necessary to take couplings on all the six dofs into account 3 2 2 elastic coupling conditions in practical applications the shell and the base may be joined together by welds or bolts unfortunately due to the welding defects or bolt looseness the two parts may not be rigidly coupled one more situation is that interior structures are elastically mounted inside the hull therefore effects of elastic coupling conditions on vibration responses are worth researching the elastic coupling conditions between the two substructures can be easily simulated through artificial springs with reasonable stiffness constants comparisons of vibration responses under rigid k u k v k w k α k ϕ k β k c 10 16 and elastic k c 10 5 coupling conditions as f 1 considered are shown in fig 15 obviously stiffness constants of artificial springs at junctions have great influences on vibration responses mean quadratic velocity of the shell under elastic coupling conditions is much less than the one under rigid coupling conditions as the shell and the base are rigidly connected the coupling between the two components is conservative that is to say all energy output from the source base inputs to the receiver shell nevertheless when it comes to elastic coupling conditions some energy output from the source base is converted to potential energy of springs 3 3 effects of boundary conditions on vibration responses in this section effects of boundary conditions on vibration responses are studied both ends of the cylindrical shell are restricted by artificial springs as a result arbitrary boundary conditions can be easily obtained by selecting appropriate stiffness constants of springs for instance the clamped boundary condition is simulated by setting a very large stiffness constant 10 16 and the free boundary condition is obtained through setting the stiffness constant to zero fig 16 shows vibration responses of the shell base system under three different boundary conditions as f 1 considered stiffness constants of artificial springs distributed at the two ends of the shell are assigned as 0 10 7 and 10 16 to simulate free elastic and clamped boundary conditions respectively apparent influences are observed in vibration responses under different boundary conditions especially at low frequency range and peak frequencies increase as stiffness constants increase however with the increase of analysis frequency influences of boundary conditions become weaker it is attributed to that the low frequency range corresponds to the stiffness controlled behavior while the high frequency range corresponds to the mass controlled behavior 4 conclusions in present paper a hybrid analytical numerical approach is developed to investigate vibration characteristics of a cylindrical shell with interior structures wbm and fem are adopted to model the shell and interior structures respectively flügge theory is utilized to describe motion equations of the shell and the admissible displacement functions are expressed as wave functions interior structures are analyzed by fem which can well deal with the geometrical complexity the two substructures are coupled together through the artificial spring technique with appropriate stiffness constants arbitrary coupling conditions between the shell and interior structures can be simulated similarly the two ends of the shell are also subjected to artificial springs for illustrative purposes a shell base system is adopted herein comparisons of vibration responses obtained from present method and those calculated by fem show high accuracy of the hybrid method stiffness and force on one dof at coupling points dominate its effects of coupling on vibration responses the smaller the stiffness is and the larger the force is the greater the effects become in consequence as to the shell base system taking all the six dofs into account is a more reasonable choice the hybrid analytical numerical method in this paper shows great potential in variable parameters analysis for different coupling conditions unlike fem there is no need to reformulate the whole system matrix in present method and only the matrix consisting of spring stiffness constants needs to be updated it leads to reduced computational efforts and is rather simple and easy to deal with on the other hand owing to wbm being utilized to model the cylindrical shell present method can be further extended to investigate wave propagations in the shell acknowledgment

complicated structures the cylindrical shell is analyzed through exact wave based method wbm flügge theory is adopted to describe motion equations of the shell and displacement functions are expressed as wave functions interior structures are modelled by means of finite element method fem and coupled to the shell through the artificial spring technique by allowing a wide variation range of spring stiffness constants different coupling conditions between the shell and interior structures can be easily simulated comparisons of results individually obtained from this hybrid method and fem demonstrate the high accuracy of the hybrid method some numerical examples are given herein to further study effects of coupling conditions and boundary conditions on vibration responses of the shell with interior structures keywords cylindrical shells with interior structures hybrid analytical numerical method vibration analysis elastic coupling conditions 1 introduction cylindrical shells are widely used as basic components to simulate aerospace submarine and pipe structures and so forth over the past few decades considerable attention has been paid to investigating vibration characteristics of cylindrical shells and most of these works were well documented in the publications leissa 1993 qatu 2002a 2002b in practical engineering applications various irregular shaped facilities may be mounted inside the hull nevertheless the majority of literature were concerned with pure cylindrical shells bert and malik 1996 stanley and ganesan 1995 xiang et al 2002 zhang and xiang 2007 and shells with simple attachments such as ring stiffeners wah and hu 1968 mustafa and ali 1989 jafari and bagheri 2006 circular plates smith and haft 1967 cheng and nicolas 1992 as well as longitudinal floors missaoui et al 1996 wang et al 2004 due to the difficulty in modelling and solution process it is laborious to study vibrations of complicated structures through theoretical methods as a discretization approach fem is a powerful tool to approximately deal with structural vibration problems one advantage of fem is the ability to model complex structures which can t be dealt with by analytical methods however to ensure the accuracy of fem results the number of elements will increase sharply as the frequency increases which seriously reduces computational efficiency and increases storage space therefore in terms of the cylindrical shell with interior structures developing an efficient approach which combines advantages of the analytical method and numerical method is meaningful unfortunately owing to the complexity involved in the coupling of the two methods the number of researches on structural vibrations utilizing the hybrid analytical numerical approach is rather limited to the authors best knowledge there are some but not many literature concerning structure vibrations by means of the hybrid method grice and pinnington 2000a investigated forced vibration characteristics of a beam stiffened plate the complete structure was divided into two independent parts namely a beam and a plate the beam was analyzed by fem while the plate was modelled using analytical impedances grice and pinnington 2000b the two components were eventually coupled together through a standard sub structuring procedure in a subsequent study grice and pinnington 2002 the hybrid method was used to study flexural vibrations of a thin plate box and the results were validated by laboratory measurements li et al 2014 developed a hybrid finite element fourier spectral method to analyze free vibrations of beams and plates based on energy principle the analytical and numerical domains which were respectively studied through fourier spectral method and fem were coupled by introducing artificial springs ettouney et al 1994 investigated vibrational and acoustical characteristics of a submerged cylindrical shell with two hemispherical end closures and an interior beam a finite difference method was adopted to model the shell and the beam was tackled using fem however ignoring rotations only continuity conditions in three translational directions were considered at the coupling point of the shell and the beam zou 2014 studied forced vibrations of an underwater cylindrical shell with an inner base the mode superposition method and fem were adopted to analyze the shell and the base respectively continuity conditions at coupling points were utilized to couple the two substructures nevertheless as a result of trigonometric functions being chosen as axial displacement functions only the simply supported cylindrical shell was taken into account maxit and ginoux 2010 proposed a substructure method called the circumferential admittance approach caa to predict vibro acoustic behavior of a submerged cylindrical shell non periodically stiffened by axisymmetric interior frames stiffeners bulkheads hemispherical end caps and so on the shell was solved in the wavenumber domain interior frames were tackled adopting axisymmetric fem and coupled to the shell in three translational directions and tangential rotation caa was also used to predict scattering pressure of the similar model in a succeeding study maxit 2014 as an extension of caa the condensed transfer functions ctf method meyer et al 2016 was subsequently developed to consider not only axisymmetric frames but also non axisymmetric ones ctf and caa were combined to study vibrations and acoustics of cylindrical shells with more complicated interior frames however it was a remarkable fact that non axisymmetric frames were connected to axisymmetric frames which were still coupled to the shell in four degrees of freedom dofs with the couplings in axial and radial rotations being neglected from the aforementioned review some researchers were devoted to combining theoretical methods and numerical methods for vibration analysis of complicated structures as for the cylindrical shell with interior attachments the couplings between the shell and attachments were insufficient ettouney et al 1994 meyer et al 2016 i e only three or four dofs were considered recently wave based method which has been adopted by the research group of authors to investigate vibrations of cylindrical shells wei et al 2013 chen et al 2015 xie et al 2017a was extended to establish governing equations of the shell coupled with interior structures in six dofs zhang et al 2017 unfortunately similar to the cited publications ettouney et al 1994 zou 2014 maxit and ginoux 2010 maxit 2014 meyer et al 2016 interior attachments were still rigidly connected to the shell in authors previous study zhang et al 2017 in practical applications the shell and attachments may be joined together by welds or bolts however due to welding defects or bolt looseness displacement continuity may not be perfectly achieved at junctions what s more there are some machines elastically mounted in the hull under these circumstances rigid couplings are not applicable as a consequence developing a method dealing with the elastic couplings between the shell and interior attachments is necessary in this paper a hybrid approach combining wbm and fem is presented to investigate vibration characteristics of a cylindrical shell coupled with interior structures the whole structure is decomposed into the independent shell and interior attachments which are analyzed through wbm and fem respectively flügge theory is used to establish motion equations of the shell and wave functions which are the essence of wbm are utilized as admissible displacement functions artificial spring technique is adopted to couple the two substructures in three translational directions and three rotations moreover as a special case rigid coupling conditions can be taken into account by assigning stiffness constants of artificial springs as a very large value xie et al 2017b several numerical examples are given to demonstrate the accuracy of present hybrid method and effects of coupling conditions as well as boundary conditions are further studied the hybrid analytical numerical approach developed in this paper is believed to include following novelties first the present method combines advantages of wbm and fem for vibration analysis of cylindrical shells with various interior structures second in contrast with the simplified processing method in literature more accurate continuity conditions between the shell and interior structures are considered by present method which is appropriate to arbitrary coupling conditions third present hybrid method shows great potential in variable parameters analysis for optimization for instance if properties of interior structures are modified there is no need to reanalyze the cylindrical shell and computation time can thus be saved 2 theoretical formulations in present paper the interior structures attached to the cylindrical shell are modelled by fem thus no limit existing in the geometric shape of interior structures in other words both simple plates and complicated structures can be analyzed for illustrative purposes a simplified base is adopted it should be known that the interior structure is not only restricted to a base and it is just a representative case due to the discretization of fem the displacement field of the base is discrete as a result line connections between the shell and the base are simulated by artificial spring systems distributed at coupling points along the junctions the shell base system and the corresponding global cylindrical co ordinate system o r θ x are schematically illustrated in fig 1 the derivation process is divided into three parts in section 2 1 based on wbm the displacement receptance functions at coupling points under coupling excitation and external excitation on the shell are derivated in section 2 2 the dynamic equations of the base are obtained by fem in section 2 3 the shell and the base are coupled together through artificial springs and the governing equations of the shell base system are established 2 1 equations of the shell 2 1 1 motion equations and admissible displacement functions the cylindrical shell is made of the isotropic and elastic material with young s modulus e s poisson s ratio υ s and density ρ s the damping is introduced by replacing young s modulus e s with a complex one e s e s 1 i η s where η s is the material loss factor l r and h are the length the radius and the thickness respectively based on wbm the cylindrical shell is divided into shell segments according to axial positions of excitations the local co ordinate system o r θ x is adopted for one segment to establish the governing equations as shown in fig 2 u v and w are the orthogonal components of displacement in axial circumferential and radial directions ϕ w x is the slope n is the axial force resultant m is the bending moment resultant t and s represent the circumferential and lateral kelvin kirchhoff shear force resultants respectively on the basis of flügge shell theory motion equations of a thin cylindrical segment can be expressed as flügge 1973 1 l 11 u l 12 v l 13 w 0 l 21 u l 22 v l 23 w 0 l 31 u l 32 v l 33 w 0 where flügge differential operators l i j i j 1 2 3 of the cylindrical shell are given in appendix a the displacement functions of cylindrical shell can be expressed in terms of wave functions leissa 1993 2 u u s u a n 0 n m 1 8 u n m s e j λ n m s x cos n θ u n m a e j λ n m

where superscripts s and a correspond to symmetric and anti symmetric circumferential modes respectively λ n m s and λ n m a are axial wavenumbers j represents the imaginary unit ω is the angular frequency n is the truncated circumferential mode number for a given circumferential mode number n substituting symmetric anti symmetric wave functions into eq 1 three linear equations in terms of contribution coefficients u n m s v n m s and w n m s u n m a v n m a and w n m a are obtained correspondingly λ n m s λ n m a can be determined by setting the determinant of the equations to zero the

a w n 7 a w n 8 a in eq 3 the matrices vectors respectively corresponding to symmetric and anti symmetric circumferential modes have the same forms for clarity of derivation only d n s and f n s corresponding to the symmetric circumferential mode are expressed in appendix a 2 1 2 boundary and continuity conditions with regard to boundary conditions of the shell both classical and elastic ones can be taken into consideration by introducing artificial springs the resulting expressions are as follows 8 k u u n 0 k v v t 0 k w w s 0 k ϕ ϕ m v 0 where indicates the boundary at the right end and denotes the boundary at the left end k u k v k w and k ϕ are the stiffness constants of springs in different directions through assigning different spring constants arbitrary boundary conditions can be obtained for instance the classical free and fixed boundaries are simulated by assigning spring constants as zero and a very large value respectively apart from boundary conditions continuity conditions of adjacent segments need to be taken into account the cylindrical shell is assumed to be divided into p segments displacements and force resultants at the cross sections of the i th and i 1 th i 1 p 1 segments are illustrated in fig 3 and geometrical compatibility and force equilibrium conditions at the junction are expressed as follows 9 u i r u i 1 l v i r v i 1 l w i r w i 1 l ϕ i r ϕ i 1 l 10 n i r n i 1 l t i r t i 1 l s i r s i 1 l m v i r m v i 1 l 2 1 3 excitations as concentrated excitations are applied on the shell modifications are necessary for the force equilibrium conditions expressed in eq 10 assuming that the global coordinate of an excitation is r θ 0 x 0 the excitation with amplitude f 0 is described in terms of dirac delta functions as 11 f f 0 δ x x 0 δ θ θ 0 r where 12 f 0 f u f v f w m u m v m w τ generally as for thin cylindrical shells four displacements and four force resultants are adopted to describe the boundary conditions of the shell in consequence the continuity conditions at the junction of two shell segments consist of four displacement compatibility equations and four force equilibrium equations as given in eqs 9 and 10 nevertheless with regard to common beam element and shell element in fem there are six dofs at each node apparently it seems difficult to couple interior structures with the shell in six dofs at each coupling point and this may be the reason that only three dofs were considered at the coupling point in the literature ettouney et al 1994 to obtain more realistic and reasonable coupling conditions between the shell and interior structures m u and m w are worth being taken into consideration which will be discussed in the following analysis in present paper as shown in fig 4 the two moments are converted to equivalent couples 13 f 1 a m u 14 f 2 a m w where a is the arm of couples if a is small enough the moment and its equivalent couple will have the same driving effects herein sin θ a 2 r 10 4 supposing that the excitation is located at the junction of the i th and i 1 th segments the force equilibrium conditions are modified as 15 n i r n i 1 l f u r t i r t i 1 l f v r s i r s i 1 l

in matrix form as 17 f n s x l i f n s x 0 t n s f 0 18 f n a x l i f n a x 0 t n a f 0 where l i i 1 p 1 is the length of the i th shell segment t n s and t n a are excitation transfer matrices and detailed elements of t n s are given in appendix b 2 1 4 receptance functions excitations applied on the shell are divided into two parts one is the external excitation f s e and the other is coupling excitation f s c distributed at coupling points assuming that the number of coupling points is b the corresponding dimension of vector f s c is 6 b 1 similarly the dimension of vector f s e is 6 c 1 which depends on the number of external driving points c assembling boundary and modified continuity conditions eqs 8 9 and 17 18 the governing equations are established and expressed in matrix form as 19 k n w n τ t n f s e f s c where 20 w n w n 1 s w n i s w n p s w n 1 a w n i a w n p a k n is the generalized stiffness matrix while t n is the global excitation transfer matrix detailed expressions of k n and t n are shown in appendix b from eq 19 the relationship between contribution coefficients w n and f s e as well as f s c can be written as 21 w n τ k n 1 t n f s e f s c it should be clearly recognized that only three displacement components u v w and rotation ϕ are expressed above whereas rotations α and β respectively in directions x and r are essential for the shell to couple with interior structures and they are expressed as zhang et al 2014 22 α 1 r v w θ 23 β 1 2 u r θ v x once w n is determined the receptance functions displacements x s e on all the six dofs at external driving points and x s c at coupling points under f s e and f s c can be easily obtained 24 x s e x s c n 0 n r n 1 r n 2 w n τ n 0 n r n 1 r n 2 k n 1 t n f s e f s c d 11 d 12 d 21 d 22 f s e f s c where r n 1 and r n 2 are the displacement transfer matrices corresponding to locations of excitations and the detailed elements are given in appendix c 2 2 equations of interior structures the hybrid approach presented in this paper is aimed at investigating vibration characteristics of the cylindrical shell with interior structures in order to widen the scope of application of present method an approximate but widely used method fem is adopted to model interior structures with the material loss factor η b being introduced to the stiffness matrix k b k b 1 i η b motion equations of interior structures are expressed as 25 ω 2 m b k b x b f b where x b is the vector of dofs f b is the force vector m b and k b are the mass and stiffness matrices respectively on the purpose of decreasing the scale of governing equations and improving the computational efficiency kuhar dynamic reduction method kuhar and stahle 1974 is utilized to reduce the size of mass and stiffness matrices the essence of kuhar reduction is to divide the whole dofs into two parts one is the master dofs x b m forced by external excitations or located on the junctions between the shell and the base and the other is the slave dofs x b s as a result eq 25 can be rewritten as 26 ω 2 m b m m m b m s m b s m m b s s k b m m k b m s k b s m k b s s x b m x b s f b m 0 according to the second equation in eq 26 that is 27 ω 2 m b s m m b s s k b s m k b s s x b m x b s 0 the relationship of x b s and x b m can be derivated as follows 28 x b s k b s s ω 2 m b s s 1 k b s m ω 2 m b s m x b m substituting eq 28 into the first equation in eq 26 the resulting motion equations are 29 z b x b m f b m where 30 z b k b m m ω 2 m b m m k b m s ω 2 m b m s k b s s ω 2 m b s s 1 k b s m ω 2 m b s m the master dofs x b m can be divided into two parts 31 x b m x b e x b c where x b e and x b c correspond to dofs at external driving points and coupling points respectively correspondingly eq 29 is re expressed as 32 z b 11 z b 12 z b 21 z b 22 x b e x b c f b e f b c where f b e is external excitation vector and f b c represents coupling excitation vector 2 3 coupling of the shell and interior structures artificial spring technique is introduced to couple the shell and the base taking one coupling point for example the six springs are illustrated in fig 5 and they are written in matrix form as follows 33 k d i a g k u k v k w k α k ϕ k β at coupling points force equilibrium conditions are necessary and the relationship between f s c applied on the shell and f b c applied on interior structures is expressed as follows 34 f s c f b c on the other hand the relationship between displacements and forces at coupling points can be described as 35 f s c k x b c x s c where k d i a g k 1 k 2 k b 1 k b the subscripts 1 2 b 1 b correspond to coupling points assembling the receptance functions of shell eq 24 reduced dynamic equations of interior structures eq 32 and coupling

s e z b 22 d 21 f s e once f s c is determined by solving eq 36 the vibration responses of the cylindrical shell can be easily calculated as mentioned above different coupling conditions can be simulated by setting spring constants to appropriate values for example if all spring constants are large enough the all elements of k 1 will approach zero then eq 36 can be regarded as governing equations of the rigidly coupled shell base system 3 results and analysis 3 1 convergence and validity analysis of present method a cylindrical shell and base system is employed to check the validity and accuracy of present method the geometrical dimensions of the shell are the length l 9 6 m the radius r 3 5 m and the thickness h 0 028 m the dimensions of the base are the length 4 8 m from x 2 4 m to x 7 2 m the width 2 m the height 1 2 m the thickness of panel 0 056 m and the thickness of web 0 052 m besides the shell and the base are made of the same material young s modulus 210 gpa poisson s ratio 0 3 density 7850 kg m 3 and loss factor 0 01 without otherwise specification the geometry and material properties keep unchanged in the following analysis the external point force f 1 is located at the center of the panel of the base and is perpendicular to the panel the amplitude of f 1 is 1 n and the range of analysis frequency varies from 1 hz to 200 hz with step 1 hz first of all the convergence of present method for vibration responses is discussed the shell is clamped at both ends through setting k u k v k w and k ϕ to a very large value 10 16 similarly stiffness constants of artificial springs distributed at junctions between the shell and base are also assigned as 10 16 to simulate rigid coupling conditions the hybrid approach developed in this paper consists of two methods one is wbm for the shell and the other is fem for interior structures consequently convergence of both wbm and fem should be firstly discussed and three cases will be considered to check the validity and accuracy the results of present approach are compared with those fully calculated by the finite element software ansys in which shell181 elements are used for the finite element discretization of the shell base system there s no doubt that convergence of fem is essential and three kinds of meshes with different sizes are designed the three cases and three meshes are shown in table 1 in the table n is the truncated circumferential mode number of wbm while m s means the mesh size of fem in this section the displacement response and mean quadratic velocity mqv of the cylindrical shell are presented in db as follow 37 l d 20 lg d a m p 10 12 38 l m q v 10 lg v 2 10 18 v 2 1 s s h e l l v r θ x 2 d s in eq 37 d a m p represents the amplitude of displacement in eq 38 s s h e l l is the area of the cylindrical shell fig 6 gives the normal displacement response at the driving point and mqv of the shell as f 1 considered under the three cases it is clearly observed that results of case 3 are different from those of case 1 and case2 and results of case 1 and case 2 are almost identical as a consequence the truncated circumferential mode number n is set to 30 and the mesh size of the inner base is 0 075 m in the following analysis on the other hand the length of flexural wave cremer et al 2005 in flat plate is 39 λ b π 2 e 3 ρ 1 υ 2 4 h 1 f where e ρ and υ are young s modulus density and poisson s ratio respectively h 1 is the thickness of the plate and f is the analysis frequency corresponding to h 1 0 052 m and f 200 hz the shortest wavelength of flexural wave is λ b min 1 599 m as the mesh size is 0 075 m there are at least 21 elements per wavelength fig 7 shows the normal displacement and mqv of the shell as f 1 considered under the three kinds of meshes given in table 1 it can be observed that results of mesh 3 are discrepant with results of mesh 1 and mesh 2 as analysis frequency increases and differences between results of mesh 1 and mesh 2 are little as a result the mesh size of the finite element model is chosen as 0 075 m comparisons of vibration responses calculated by present method and fem are presented in fig 8 as can be observed the results of present hybrid method agree well with those calculated by fem which demonstrates the high accuracy of present method 3 2 effects of coupling conditions on vibration responses 3 2 1 rigid coupling conditions as mentioned in the introduction coupling conditions between the shell and interior structures are insufficient in some literature ettouney et al 1994 meyer et al 2016 and only three or four degrees of freedom at junctions are considered in this section effects of coupling conditions on vibration responses are investigated it should be noted that u v and w are axial circumferential and radial displacements while α ϕ and β are axial circumferential and radial rotations respectively the normal displacement at the driving point and mqv of the shell under different coupling conditions as f 1 considered are shown in fig 9 in which all means all the six dofs are coupled k u k v k w k α k ϕ k β 10 16 and k u 1 for example means dof u is uncoupled whereas the remaining five dofs are coupled k u 1 k v k w k α k ϕ k β 10 16 for sake of avoiding the singularity of matrix k k u is set as 1 rather than 0 in order to further compare effects of each dof on vibration responses shown in fig 9 the relative difference rd is defined as 40 r d l k 1 l a l l l a l l where the subscripts k 1 k k u k v k w k α k ϕ k β and all correspond to vibration responses under insufficient and sufficient coupling conditions respectively the greater the absolute of rd the greater the effects of one dof on vibration responses fig 10 gives the curves of relative difference under different coupling conditions as f 1 considered obviously couplings on dof v dof w and dof α have significant influences on vibration responses to further study effects of coupling conditions on vibration responses excitations in different directions will be considered the direction of f 1 is changed to the axial and circumferential directions and they are defined as f 2 and f 3 respectively vibration responses of the shell base system as well as the relative difference individually driven by f 2 and f 3 are shown in figs 11 14 as can be seen coupling on dof u has negligible influence on vibrations as f 1 considered but the influence becomes obvious as f 2 considered the reason is that the direction of axial force f 2 is the same as dof u among the three forces no matter which one is applied on the shell base system couplings on dof w and dof α have significant effects on vibration responses it can be attributed to the difference of the stiffness on different dofs at coupling points as to the shell bending stiffness on dof w is much smaller than in plane stiffness on dof u and v dof α and dof ϕ both correspond to the bending stiffness on the shell but dof ϕ is concerned with the in plane shear stiffness on the base which results in the little influence of the coupling on dof ϕ at last it can be concluded that effects of one dof at coupling points on vibration responses depend on the stiffness and force on the dof the larger the coupling force is and the smaller the stiffness is the greater the effects on vibration responses become consequently to obtain more accurate prediction of vibration responses it is necessary to take couplings on all the six dofs into account 3 2 2 elastic coupling conditions in practical applications the shell and the base may be joined together by welds or bolts unfortunately due to the welding defects or bolt looseness the two parts may not be rigidly coupled one more situation is that interior structures are elastically mounted inside the hull therefore effects of elastic coupling conditions on vibration responses are worth researching the elastic coupling conditions between the two substructures can be easily simulated through artificial springs with reasonable stiffness constants comparisons of vibration responses under rigid k u k v k w k α k ϕ k β k c 10 16 and elastic k c 10 5 coupling conditions as f 1 considered are shown in fig 15 obviously stiffness constants of artificial springs at junctions have great influences on vibration responses mean quadratic velocity of the shell under elastic coupling conditions is much less than the one under rigid coupling conditions as the shell and the base are rigidly connected the coupling between the two components is conservative that is to say all energy output from the source base inputs to the receiver shell nevertheless when it comes to elastic coupling conditions some energy output from the source base is converted to potential energy of springs 3 3 effects of boundary conditions on vibration responses in this section effects of boundary conditions on vibration responses are studied both ends of the cylindrical shell are restricted by artificial springs as a result arbitrary boundary conditions can be easily obtained by selecting appropriate stiffness constants of springs for instance the clamped boundary condition is simulated by setting a very large stiffness constant 10 16 and the free boundary condition is obtained through setting the stiffness constant to zero fig 16 shows vibration responses of the shell base system under three different boundary conditions as f 1 considered stiffness constants of artificial springs distributed at the two ends of the shell are assigned as 0 10 7 and 10 16 to simulate free elastic and clamped boundary conditions respectively apparent influences are observed in vibration responses under different boundary conditions especially at low frequency range and peak frequencies increase as stiffness constants increase however with the increase of analysis frequency influences of boundary conditions become weaker it is attributed to that the low frequency range corresponds to the stiffness controlled behavior while the high frequency range corresponds to the mass controlled behavior 4 conclusions in present paper a hybrid analytical numerical approach is developed to investigate vibration characteristics of a cylindrical shell with interior structures wbm and fem are adopted to model the shell and interior structures respectively flügge theory is utilized to describe motion equations of the shell and the admissible displacement functions are expressed as wave functions interior structures are analyzed by fem which can well deal with the geometrical complexity the two substructures are coupled together through the artificial spring technique with appropriate stiffness constants arbitrary coupling conditions between the shell and interior structures can be simulated similarly the two ends of the shell are also subjected to artificial springs for illustrative purposes a shell base system is adopted herein comparisons of vibration responses obtained from present method and those calculated by fem show high accuracy of the hybrid method stiffness and force on one dof at coupling points dominate its effects of coupling on vibration responses the smaller the stiffness is and the larger the force is the greater the effects become in consequence as to the shell base system taking all the six dofs into account is a more reasonable choice the hybrid analytical numerical method in this paper shows great potential in variable parameters analysis for different coupling conditions unlike fem there is no need to reformulate the whole system matrix in present method and only the matrix consisting of spring stiffness constants needs to be updated it leads to reduced computational efforts and is rather simple and easy to deal with on the other hand owing to wbm being utilized to model the cylindrical shell present method can be further extended to investigate wave propagations in the shell acknowledgment

23507,over the past decades the offshore oil and gas industry has developed rapidly a large number of offshore structures notably jacket and jack up platforms were constructed and installed worldwide as they are often exposed to safety threats from impacts by visiting vessels and dropped objects there has been a continuous interest in understanding the impact mechanics of tubular structures and proposing practical design standards to protect from collisions this paper reviews the state of the art with respect to the response dynamics and mechanics of offshore tubular structures subjected to mass impacts covering material modelling ship impact loading energy absorption in the ship and platform global and local responses of tubular structures the residual strengths of damaged tubular

minor local structural deformation to major threats to structural integrity causing great economic loss severe environmental pollution and fatalities in extreme conditions accidental loads may cause the global collapse of entire structures and put human lives in jeopardy the huge losses from several catastrophic marine collision accidents such as the sinking of the titanic after hitting an iceberg and explosion of the mumbai high north platform after suffering a collision from a supply vessel have aroused continuous public concern regarding the operational safety of ships and offshore structures tremendous efforts have been made mainly in two directions 1 to reduce the probability of occurrence of ship collisions with the application of advanced navigational tools and administration procedures 2 to obtain crashworthy design of structures based on a thorough understanding of fundamental collision mechanics based on research outcomes rules and standards relevant for the design of crashworthy structures have been introduced e g dnv rp c204 2010 iso 19902 iso 2007 api rp2a wsd 2014 abs 2013 and hse 2004 the standards have been continuously updated to include novel knowledge and address new challenges a few review articles are available in the literature and they mainly focus on general procedures of risk analysis and structural assessments in ship collisions and groundings ellinas and valsgard 1985 moan and amdahl 1989 pedersen 2010 wang et al 2002 however no specific review exists that addresses the complicated collision mechanics of tubular structures the authors consider it highly important that researchers understand the theories and principles developed over the long time span so that they can provide a solid foundation for future research works it is therefore the purpose of this paper to bridge the gap in knowledge by presenting a comprehensive review of structural response assessments and design considerations specifically for offshore tubular structures in the accidental limit states als covering both classical references and more recent progress as well the review focuses especially on the norsok n 004 code and the dnv gl recommended practices for design against accidental loads because they contain the most detailed provisions design against extreme ship collision should be carried out in the accidental collapse limit state using risk based techniques moan 2009 the probability of system loss due to a collision of a certain intensity kinetic energy at a given location may be calculated as the product of the probability of collision with a given intensity and location multiplied with the probability of damage for the given event and the probability of system loss conditioned on the calculated damage of the structure subjected to relevant permanent loads and environmental loads it is necessary to integrate over all possible collision intensities and locations the calculated probability of system loss shall comply with the target safety level the target safety level considering all kinds of accidents implies a probability level for system loss in the range of 10 4 per year for als according to norsok n003 norsok 2017 with approximately ten different accidental categories collision accidents should therefore have an annual failure probability of 10 5 taking that into account the characteristic values are used for loads and resistance the conditional probability of failure for structures nominally at the brink of collapse is estimated to be in the range of 0 1 moan 2009 in practice it is very cumbersome to calculate the probability of failure for all intensity levels and locations simplifications are necessary it has therefore become customary to design the structure by a deterministic analysis of ship collisions with an annual probability of occurrence of 10 4 thus characteristic kinetic energy is typically determined via risk analysis as adopted in ship ship collisions analysis pedersen 2010 the design collision event that has been used for decades is the impact from a standard supply vessel with a displacement of 5000 tons travelling with a speed of 2 m s based on risk analysis this gives a design energy of 11 mj for bow impacts and 14 mj for broad side impacts considering added mass effects dnv rp c204 2010 over the years kinetic energy has increased significantly with the increased ship displacements and impact velocities identified in moan et al 2017 and kvitrud 2011 based on an overview of collision accidents in recent years moreover newly designed ship structures such as bulbous bows x bows and ice strengthened vessels may change impact consequences according to the new version norsok n003 standard norsok 2017 if no operational restrictions on allowable visiting vessel size are implemented supply ship displacements should not be selected less than 10 000 tons and unless further evaluations are performed the kinetic energy should be 50 mj for bow impacts 22 mj for stern impacts and 28 mj for broad side collisions this represents a substantial increase in the demand for collision resistance of an offshore structure the design scenarios of the new version norsok n003 standard with increased design energy may be classified as high energy collisions under high impact energies tubular members will undergo significant deformations and may fracture and fail threatening the integrity of the platform a noticeable example is the well workover vessel big orange xviii collision with the ekofisk 2 4 jacket platform in which the estimated kinetic energy was 60 mj the accident caused severe damage to the three legged jackets and also to the bow see fig 1 several braces were ruptured and the jacket had to be dismantled such high collision energies cannot be absorbed by a single member it is therefore essential to design tubular members such that they have sufficient strength to penetrate the bow and the ship bow absorbs considerable energy amdahl and johansen 2001 minor ship collisions and dropped objects often occur and cause small damage to the platform braces and legs according to taby 1986 operational damages occurring almost every year for north sea jackets are a dent depth of 10 of the tube diameter and or a permanent deflection of 0 004l where l is the span length of the member as timely repair of a damaged offshore structure is difficult and expensive it is important to have knowledge about the ultimate and post ultimate strength of damaged tubular members under various loading conditions so as to make optimal decisions regarding safety and economy a good illustration of minor ship collisions and subsequent damage assessment safety evaluation and repair was reported by sveen 1990 when a west german submarine collided with the eight legged oseberg b jacket on the norwegian continental shelf in 1988 with an estimated energy of 5 6 mj refer to fig 2 the struck diagonal brace absorbed 60 percent of the energy and suffered major damage with a large local dent and overall deflection a safety assessment of the undamaged and damaged platform was carried out using nonlinear finite element analysis nlfea the simulated accelerations and strain responses compared reasonably with data measured using the platform monitoring system during the collision the collapse analysis of the damaged platform revealed high reserve strength in jacket structures repairs to the platform by replacing the damaged brace were also reported the responses of offshore tubular structures subjected to ship impacts are complicated from various aspects e g local and global structural responses the residual strengths of damaged members and structures the behavior of tubular joints and static and dynamic effects from the perspective of energy dissipation the total energy should be dissipated through damage to both the ship and the platform there can be significant ship platform interactions depending on the relative strengths of both structures another important consideration for collisions is the response of braces and legs braces or legs in direct contact with a ship will undergo three deformation stages which are local denting global bending and membrane stretching see fig 3 and different deformation stages may interact depending on tube dimensions material properties and boundary conditions tubular members behave quite differently and deformations are governed by different patterns for example local denting dominates for short tubular members with large diameter over thickness ratios d t and global bending dominates for long tubes with small d t ratios however most tubes are likely to sustain damage due to combined local denting and overall bending braces and legs in the vicinity of a struck member will also deform and absorb energy supporting braces subjected to axial compression may buckle and dissipate energy during collisions especially when a ship strikes platform joints in view of the considerable number of aspects of the problem and their complexities ship collisions with offshore tubular structures remain a topic under intensive research and may become increasingly important as vessels grow larger the aim of this work is to review the state of the art impact response mechanics of offshore tubular structures and the design of crashworthy tubular structures the review includes nine principal sections section 2 introduces the methods for ship collision assessments and discusses material modelling and fracture section 3 presents typical ship impact loadings on offshore tubular structures section 4 reviews the global impact responses of offshore tubular structures in sections 5 and 6 the responses of single tubular members subjected to lateral impacts section 5 and axial compression section 6 are extensively discussed sections 7 and 8 deal with the responses of tubular joints and ultimate strengths of damaged tubes respectively section 9 addresses the design of crashworthy offshore tubular structures section 10 concludes the review and indicates potential topics of interest for future research 2 methods for ship collision assessments 2 1 analysis methods the analysis and design of offshore structures subjected to ship impacts requires reliable and efficient analysis tools for predicting structural damage and residual strength of damaged structures full scale experiments or model tests are considered to be the most straightforward and accurate method if the scaling law is properly handled nlfea methods have shown powerful capabilities to assess structural responses in ship collisions using coarsely meshed shell elements the commonly used general purpose nlfea packages include ls dyna hallquist 2006 abaqus hibbitt et al 2001 and msc dytran ansys usfos soreide et al 1999 which is a special purpose software based on beam column analysis is also available for efficiently and accurately predicting damage and collapse of offshore structures usfos follows the idea of the idealized structural unit method isum proposed by ueda and rashed 1984 and ueda et al 1985 in the method a structure is divided into the largest structural units possible and the geometric and material nonlinear behaviors are described in a concise analytical numerical form simplified analytical methods based on plastic analysis are often preferable in the design stage as they provide quick and reasonable predictions of structural resistance and damage and provide significant details on the underlying mechanics of structural responses in addition the resulting equations often have a simple form and are well suited to be written into design standards regarding accidental actions in order to select a proper method for ship collision analysis and design it is essential for analysts and designers to balance the required accuracy computational time and modelling efforts while considering the pros and cons of each method as follows experimental methods are useful for impact analyses of one or a few tubular members but impact experiments with entire platforms can hardly be undertaken real impacts such as the big orange ekofisk 2 4 w collision yield valuable information though simplified methods are by their very nature simple and are useful for the preliminary design and rapid assessment of structural responses but the global response of a platform is difficult to capture nlfeas employing beam column models e g usfos are capable of predicting the global response of a platform with substantially reduced computational time and resources compared to shell analysis and still with reasonably good accuracy the detailed local damage is however not provided and ship platform interactions with increasing contact area are not captured an improvement to this may be to find an empirical correction factor which is a function of dent depth and tube diameter nlfeas employing shell elements and explicit solutions methods e g ls dyna and abaqus are capable of predicting both local and global responses of struck platforms and capturing ship platform interaction effects but the required modelling effort for platforms and ships are substantial and computational time will be large significant efforts may be needed to calibrate models against code capacities for e g joints local buckling etc especially for residual strength assessments in damaged conditions 2 2 modelling material behavior and fracture steel offshore constructions are generally designed to perform an optimum between the two poles of safety and reliability on one hand and economy on the other hand fixed offshore structures are conventionally constructed from medium grade structural steels with yield strengths that are typically 355 mpa meanwhile high strength steels with yield strengths of 420 500 mpa are being increasingly applied due to their good performance with respect to increased strength to weight ratio and attendant savings in material costs and construction schedules billingham et al 2003 the steel grades are well documented in rules and standards such as dnv os b101 2009 norsok m 120 2008 bs en 10225 2009 abs modu 2012 etc even higher strength steels 550 mpa and often up to 700 mpa are also applied in mobile jack up drilling rigs billingham et al 2003 as the demand for lightweight offshore structures with high energy absorption capacities increases significantly an increasing tendency to use high strength steels can be expected particular concerns regarding the application of high strength steels are however their greater susceptibility to hydrogen cracking fatigue and fracture the mechanical behaviors of isotropic steel materials can be described by the complete stress strain curves from tensile tests as plotted in fig 4 the engineering stress strain curve includes the linear elastic stage plastic yielding a yield plateau strain hardening necking postnecking softening and fracture this should be converted to a true stress strain curve with proper corrections on postnecking softening in order to be used in nlfea the strengths of steel are likely to be influenced by the strain rates and ambient temperature as well construction steels possess substantial ductility due to strain hardening and are capable of absorbing considerable energy after the initial yielding the performance of steel ductility may be evaluated with the yield ratio σ y σ u which is defined as the initial yield stress over the ultimate stress and the elongation at fracture mild steels which have low yield ratios and large elongation percentages at fracture generally have better ductility performance than high strength steels referring to fig 4 whereas billingham et al 2003 stated that modern clean steels with low carbon contents and low levels of impurities may experience significant elongations even at high strength and high yield ratios in simplified analytical analyses steel materials are often assumed to be rigid perfectly plastic neglecting strain hardening for simplicity and this is conservative if materials with no hardening or little hardening are used in real construction the structures are however likely to develop localized deformations e g local hinges and trigger early fracture the strain rate effect in ship collisions is complicated on one hand it increases the initial yield stress and plastic flow stress of the material which is beneficial on the other hand the increased stress level is believed to reduce steel ductility and trigger a possible transition from ductile to brittle fracture however recent experiments choung et al 2013 li and chandra 1999 have shown that the elongation at fracture could either increase with higher strain rates or not have an obvious dependence this was however for tension coupon specimens that did not include cracks weld defects a widely used model for ship collision analyses was developed by cowper and symonds 1957 in which the strain rate effect was accounted for by scaling the static stress with a dynamic hardening factor dhf 1 σ d y n σ s t a t 1 ε c 1 p where ε is the strain rate and c and p are parameters that are calibrated from experiments cowper and symonds 1957 suggested c 40 4 s 1 and p 5 for the initial yield stress of mild steels based on experiments paik and thayamballi 2003 recommended c 3200 s 1 and p 5 for the initial yield of high strength steels jones 1989 stated that the c parameter should be linearly dependent on plastic strains whereas choung et al 2013 suggested to relate it to the plastic strain squared storheim and amdahl 2017 showed that calibrations based on initial yield stress would overestimate collision resistance significantly and suggested calibrating the model to the plastic flow stress nevertheless ship collisions normally occur at relatively low speeds smaller than 10 m s and the effect of strain rate on the structural response is generally limited in view of the considerable uncertainties related to strain rate effects and how to include them in a realistic manner it is recommended that the effect be disregarded in analyses of ship collisions with offshore structures another important issue is the low temperature conditions for ships and offshore structures working in arctic regions kim et al 2016 carried out material tensile tests and dropped object tests at room temperature and a low temperature of 60 c and found that the strength of steels became stronger at low temperatures and that brittle fracture may occur to conduct realistic and reliable ship collision simulations with nlfea it is essential to correctly calibrate material behavior into idealized material models the isotropic power law hardening model with a yield plateau is often used to describe steel behavior a range of input parameters need to be determined most of which have significant statistical variability and the evaluations require a high degree of craftsmanship vanderhorn and wang 2011 conducted a significant statistical study on the material properties of shipbuilding steels gained from approximately 140 000 tensile tests the data were collected from five manufacturers delivering steels for abs class ships during 2004 2009 the importance of considering the statistical uncertainties of steel material properties were indicated the probabilistic density distributions of the yield and ultimate stresses and percent elongations of different steel grades were presented hogström and ringsberg 2012 studied the influence of uncertainties of the input material parameters on the shape and size of damage to a struck ship and showed that the scattering of material properties and the choice of fracture criterion would lead to large differences in the outcome of the analysis a recent benchmark study ringsberg et al 2018 was initiated by the marstruct virtual institute for modelling buckling and fracture of structures with nlfea where 15 groups of well established researchers worldwide were invited to simulate the indentation response of a side shell structure and simulation results were compared to experiments the results showed significant scattering with respect to collision resistance and energy absorption owing to the adopted different strategies for structure modelling material calibration numerical settings and fracture criteria etc recent efforts by dnv gl with the new version dnv rp c208 2016 are dedicated to mitigating such uncertainties in assessments of nonlinear structural responses guidance or requirements are provided for many of the challenging aspects storheim et al 2017 stated that when evaluating the material strength of a body it is good practice to assess whether a high or low strength is more unfavorable for the object in question in ship collisions for example the most unfavorable combination is a high material strength of the striking vessel and a low material strength of the struck vessel typically the characteristic resistance of a body should represent a 5 probability that the resistance is less than the specified value the revised dnv rp c208 2016 opts for the characteristic resistance with a lower fractile for the struck vessel and mean values for the striking vessel which seems like a reasonable approach to obtain a combined 5 fractile storheim et al 2017 another big challenge is to accurately capture material fracture initiation and propagation with coarsely meshed shell elements the complexity lies in that fracture is a localized phenomenon on the length scale of plate thickness and is difficult to capture with large shell elements the sizes of which are several times larger than the plate thickness in addition fracture depends highly on stress states material deformation history and is sensitive to the mesh size adopted it is essential to correctly calibrate the material properties in order to accurately capture strain localizations and subsequent fracture the probabilistic nature of material properties makes fracture modelling even more complicated quite a few fracture criteria exist in the literature for structures modelled with large scale shell elements the bwh bressan williams hill criterion alsos et al 2008 and the rtcl rice tracey and cockcroft latham fracture criterion tørnqvist 2003 may be recommended as they generally show reasonable and consistent predictions in several benchmark studies calle et al 2017 ehlers et al 2008 marinatos and samuelides 2015 storheim et al 2015 with various small and large scale tests refined fracture models are needed for further studies 3 ship impact loading offshore structures may potentially suffer collisions from ships of different types including visiting vessels such as supply vessels and passing vessels e g oil tankers containerships bulk carriers submarines and passenger ships the different ship types with different displacements and structural designs yield quite different ship impact loadings on the struck structures for offshore structures struck by visiting attendant vessels the current dnv rp c204 2010 recommends a design supply vessel with a displacement of 5000 tons and the corresponding design force deformation curves for broad side bow and stern impacts are shown in fig 5 many of the curves were based on simplified analytical methods when they were derived the recently updated version of the dnv rp c204 standard dnv gl 2018 to be released has accounted for new features of increased ship displacements new ship bow designs and ice strengthened structures the recommended force deformation curves for standard design vessels with displacements of 6500 10 000 tons are shown in fig 6 the design resistance increases significantly compared to the old version curves for supply vessels with bulbous bows the force deformation relationship for bow impacts of the design vessels is given in fig 7 with both no ice reinforcements and ice 1c class force deformation curves for bow impacts of a design oil tanker 125 000 dwt and a design very large crude carrier vlcc 340 000 dwt are also recommended in the updated version of the dnv rp c204 standard dnv gl 2018 the curves presuppose that the impacted structure does not undergo substantial deformation such that the strength design requirements are complied with if this condition is not met interactions between the bow and the impacted structure shall be taken into consideration referring to haris and amdahl 2013 for a specific ship given structural details and material properties nlfea may be carried out to accurately predict the ship indentation resistance alternatively simplified methods can be used to obtain a rapid assessment of ship crushing resistance with reasonable accuracy this normally applies to ship collisions with ship sides fpsos or large diameter columns minorsky 1958 presented pioneering work that empirically related the energy absorbed in ship damage to the volume of damaged material based on full scale ship collision data the regression fit the data quite well in the high energy impact regions for conventional ships but the model can be questioned when applied to modern designed ships simplified analytical models for the crushing of plated structures notably ship bows can generally be categorized into two groups i e the intersection unit method and the plate unit method according to yamada and pedersen 2008 the intersection unit method follows the suggestion by gerard 1958 to divide complicated plated structures into basic intersecting units such as l t and x elements see fig 8 a left and b examples of the intersection unit method are amdahl 1983 yang and caldwell 1988 ohtsubo and suzuki 1994 etc the plate unit method was proposed by paik and pedersen 1995 where the structures are divided into separate plate units refer to fig 8 a right and c more details can be found in the benchmark study carried out by yamada and pedersen 2008 in which simplified methods for the axial crushing of plated structures were reviewed and predicted crushing resistances by different models were compared with a series of large scale tests on the axial crushing of bulbous bow models in addition shell plates may be subjected to stretching and develop significant membrane forces simplified models for laterally struck shell plates are found in jones et al 1970 and zhu 1990 and more recently in haris and amdahl 2012 and sun et al 2015 for ship sides 4 global response of offshore platforms 4 1 energy dissipation during a collision part of the kinetic energy will be absorbed through plastic straining structural motion and vibrations and hydrodynamic dissipation by accelerating added masses depending on the collision angle and relative position some kinetic energy may remain after the collision often ship collision assessments are carried out in two steps i e analyses of external dynamics and internal mechanics as first suggested by minorsky 1958 external dynamics deals with global motions of the striking and struck bodies before during and after collisions and predicts total energy absorption in the structures this energy should be dissipated in the internal mechanics analysis through structural deformations of the two colliding bodies regarding energy dissipation in ship ship collisions the elastic energy of ship hull girder vibrations is often considered to be negligible this was proved to be reasonable by pedersen and li 2009 and they showed that elastic energy absorbed by the struck ship through global hull girder vibrations was normally small and varied from 1 to 6 of the energy released in crushing based on the conservation of momentum pedersen and zhang 1998 proposed a closed form solution for energy dissipation in ship collisions considering planar surge sway and yaw motions stronge 2004 developed a solution for impacts of rigid bodies considering 6dof motions liu and amdahl 2010 reformulated stronge s 6dof model in a local coordinate system for ship collisions which allowed objects with three dimensional geometries and eccentricities such as icebergs to be considered the accuracy of the external dynamics models was discussed by tabri 2012 and yu et al yu and amdahl 2016 yu et al 2016a 2016b by comparison with coupled simulations the external dynamic models were found to be capable of predicting energy dissipation at the end of the first impact with good accuracy in general the prediction accuracy tended to decrease for cases with small collision angles and long durations possible secondary impacts caused by periodic motions were not captured the input normal vector of the tangential contact plane for the 6dof external dynamic model should be determined with care if the struck object is able to cover the striking ship bow ship motions may potentially be locked by structural deformations the use of the normal vectors of the undamaged structural surfaces may not give the correct predictions the coupled simulation model developed by yu et al yu and amdahl 2016 yu et al 2016a 2016b is capable of capturing hydrodynamic forces 6dof ship motions and structural damage simultaneously but virtually does not increase computational time the time for calculating hydrodynamic forces is negligible compared to that for structural response calculations fig 9 shows results from a coupled simulation of a supply vessel colliding with a vertical jacket leg 20 2 60 length m diameter m thickness mm with an impact kinetic energy of approximately 60 mj the trajectories of several representative nodes were recorded the ship rolled anticlockwise initially with large collision forces and bending moments and rolled back after some time under the action of the water restoring forces the complex 6dof ship motions and structural deformations were well captured it was observed that the external dynamic models by pedersen and zhang 1998 and liu and amdahl 2010 may fail to work for ship collisions with braces and legs because a leg would penetrate deep into the striking vessel structure and the striking ship motions would then be locked to some extent by the local deformations in such cases the assumption of rigid body collisions sharing a common tangential plane at the contact surface of the colliding bodies is no longer valid and the dissipated energy is much underestimated a similar phenomenon can be expected when a strong ship bow penetrates a weak ship side at an oblique collision angle more information on the discussion of accuracy of external dynamic models can be found in yu 2017 and yu and amdahl 2017 for offshore jackets and jack up platforms in relatively deep water the first natural periods may become comparable to typical ship impact durations and the elastic energy absorbed by platform motions needs to be accounted for this is especially the case for jack up platforms which are characterized by large natural periods and limited stiffness against lateral deflections pedersen 2013 and zhang et al 2015 proposed a simplified model for assessing the external dynamics of ship collisions considering global motions of the struck object like wind turbines quays bridges and jack up rigs see fig 10 platform motions in the transverse direction were considered the platform was found to absorb much less plastic energy compared to that assuming pure rigidity the model may be further developed to consider rotational motions in eccentric collisions nlfeas are often carried out when the global response of platform becomes important petersen and pedersen 1981 studied a ship swaying into a fixed jacket platform using a code that they developed they found that the global elastic energy of the platform was considerable when the platform had either a very large or a very small dynamic stiffness compared to the collision forces travanca and hao 2015 simulated quite a few ship collision cases with three different jacket platforms using ls dyna the platforms were modelled with shell elements they found that global elastic deflection energy could be important for jackets especially for large platforms the portions of global elastic energy out of total energy were large for ship collision with strong legs and tubular joints which have large local stiffness at the impact point travanca and hao 2014a simulated ship collisions with jacket and jack up platforms using ls dyna with shell elements and simplified the platform global response with equivalent single degree of freedom sdof systems they found that the equivalent sdof models were able to simulate global deflections of the platforms generally well however in eccentric collisions both the lateral and torsional responses were prominent for the jack up platforms equivalent models in such cases should account for both lateral and torsional responses the rotational responses were found to be less important for jackets in the studied cases in a different study by travanca and hao 2015 rotational stiffness was found important for a tripod in eccentric collisions amdahl and holmas 2016 analyzed the response of a typical jack up subjected to a high energy collision of 67 mj on a corner leg using usfos soreide et al 1999 the platform was installed at a water depth of 110 m and the first eigen period was 7 8 s it was found that the ship spent considerable time in the elastic unloading phase 1 9 5 2 s and up to 25 mj was stored as elastic energy mainly in the platform during impact the inertia force was important and the temporal impact force depended on the jack up response which could not be calculated a priori the compliance of the platform contributed significantly to the survival of the impact and needed to be considered 4 2 static and dynamic responses in ship platform collisions collisions between offshore platforms and boats are complex problems many approaches exist with varied simplifications for predicting the impact responses of vessels and platforms gjerde et al 1999 compared methods to assess the response of jack ups to boat impact and provided recommendations regarding their levels of accuracy simplified equations were found to be reasonable when structural failure was governed by failure of the impacted member or connected adjacent members that were incorporated in hand calculations for cases where structural failure was not governed by failure of the impacted member the energy absorption capabilities of the platform were underestimated by the simplified methods more accurate predictions were obtained through static and dynamic nlfeas of the entire platform the dynamic effects in ship platform collisions may be classified into two parts the local effect and the global effect the local dynamic effect is characterized by the strain rate sensitivity of the material and the inertia effect of the impacted and adjacent members the influence of the local dynamic effect is found to be generally limited in the normal range of ship impact velocities based on drop hammer test results jones et al 1992 on clamped end tubular members with varied impact velocities up to 14 m s jones and shen 1992 concluded that the quasi static approach yielded errors generally smaller than 10 percent when the striking mass was at least approximately four times larger than the beam mass provided a different failure mechanism was not activated more recently zhang et al 2018 conducted similar tests and found that dynamic hardening amplification was generally below 10 percent up to 10 m s a further increase in impact velocity to 13 m s however yielded a much larger dynamic hardening increase of around 20 percent the global dynamic effect activates the global motions of the platform structure which is especially important for jack ups during collisions the platform deck must be accelerated and there is a large force going up to the deck there is a response lag of the deck compared to the hit region due to the large inertia of the deck and the force may be calculated assuming support at the deck in a static approach the force is smaller because of deck displacement fig 11 shows the dynamic response of a jack up platform subjected to ship side collisions at the time instants of the maximum collision force and the maximum displacement the analysis was carried out by amdahl and eberg 1993 using usfos the displacements were magnified by a factor of 20 it was easily observed that the platform deck was virtually unmoved when the maximum collision force was reached in the usfos dynamic analysis the resistance to penetration of the ship bow was modelled with a nonlinear spring fig 12 a shows a force end shortening curve for the spring that was reproduced in the simulation as input and the resulting collision force history is shown in fig 12 b it is observed that the ship spent considerable time in the elastic unloading phase and that the platform received a significant impulse during this phase the impulse depended significantly on the unloading stiffness adopted which should be realistically estimated amdahl and eberg 1993 also found that three factors could be crucial to the dynamic effects the local strength of the platform relative to the ship the duration of the collision relative to the fundamental period of the governing motion and the strength of the members transmitting forces needed to accelerate the deck dynamic effects are more important for hard impacts on legs or joints than impacts on braces this is because brace impacts are soft and the forces are not sufficient to move the platform substantially whereas legs or tubular joints have greater strengths this was confirmed in azadi 2007 who simulated a ship collision with an 8 leg jacket in the north sea using usfos he also found that the dynamic effects were more significant in broad side collisions than in bow and stern collisions levanger et al 2016 emphasized the dynamic effects in high energy impacts 40 mj when carrying out quasi static and dynamic analyses of a ship jack up collision using usfos and abaqus multiple impacts between a vessel and jack ups are possible which increase plastic energy absorption and damage levels ellinas 1995 notaro et al 2015 carried out a nonlinear dynamic analysis of high energy ship jacket collisions with two methods i e a beam column analysis using usfos and the nlfea method using abaqus with shell elements in the impact region and beam elements for the global structure the two methods obtained reasonable agreement in general but significant differences may occur for scenarios where local denting or large changes in the contact surface occur this is because usfos does not capture the ship platform interaction effect with increasing contact surface area analysts may consider extracting force penetration curves from the ship impacts on deformable tubular members rather than rigid tubular members as the inputs to usofs when the ship and platform strengths fall within the shared energy range 4 3 platform pile soil interaction in most cases it has been observed that the base shears and overturning moments caused by the collision forces are significantly smaller than those created by extreme waves such that soil failure can normally be disregarded in collisions the soil will generally contribute little to energy dissipation and as a first step it may be useful to model jacket legs as being clamped at the mudline this simplifies the calculations and is conservative le sourne et al 2015 carried out a numerical analysis of an offshore wind turbine jacket impacted by a supply vessel the soil stiffness was modelled with rotational and translational springs the results showed that the soil effect had little influence on leg responses however the soil effect has often been considered to be important in barge bridge pier collisions consolazio et al 2003 and bridges under earthquake conditions makris and gazetas 1992 it is useful to check the capacity of piles in tension compression and lateral deformation but it should first be pointed out that neglecting the soil effect is conservative when considering platform safety soil stiffness in ship collisions if considered is often modelled with springs for example jin et al 2005 simplified the effects of soil reactions into three kinds of non linear springs namely a lateral spring representing the lateral bearing capacity of the soil a vertical spring representing the vertical friction force on the pile surface and a torsion spring representing the circumferential friction force on the pile surface azadi 1998 developed a simplified equivalent model for the pile soil system which was modelled as a stack of multiple disks the idea of a finite disk or strip idealization of the soil medium around a pile was originally introduced by several authors including nogami and konagai 1986 nordal et al 1985 etc the disks are connected to each other via pile beam elements the nonlinear spring and disk representation has been implemented in the usfos program the piles and springs can be modelled automatically for each layer based on the api rp2a wsd api rp2a wsd 2014 rules example pile soil models are shown in fig 13 5 response of tubular members subjected to lateral impacts considerable energy will be dissipated through plastic straining of the ship and platform during a collision often braces legs in direct contact with the ship will deform significantly and absorb a large portion of the total energy the lateral impact response of a single tubular member involves three deformation patterns of local denting global bending and membrane deformation the response behavior can be influenced by many factors such as axial loading boundary conditions impact locations initial inclination angles of tubes etc 5 1 local indentation resistance of tubular members and ring stiffened columns 5 1 1 local indentation resistance of tubular braces and legs many researchers have studied the indentation resistance of tubular members subjected to lateral impacts based on experimental observations they have proposed different idealized models for the deformed tubular cross sections a few examples are shown in fig 14 including 1 in fig 14 a the dented part is flat and the remaining part is undamaged the model in fig 14 a is simple to use and has been employed by many researchers such as furnes and amdahl 1980 1980 ellinas and walker 1983 and allan 1992 2 in fig 14 b the dented cross section consists of a flat part and arcs with different diameters in the remaining part the model in fig 14 b was proposed by wierzbicki and suh 1988 and was also used in buldgen et al 2014 3 fig 14 c and d describe the behaviors of deformed tubular cross sections that include local indentation and combined local denting and global bending the denting model in fig 14 c consists of a flat part and an arc with the diameter different from the original the model in fig 14 c and d was proposed by jones and shen 1992 fig 14 d was often used to separate local and global deformations while post processing experimental and numerical data such as in cerik et al 2016 travanca and hao 2014b more recently zhu et al 2017 carried out an experimental study of the dynamic response of fully clamped pipes subjected to dropped hammer impacts they described the cross section of the damaged tube along the tube length with a three segment mode changing from circular to oval and finally the dented region the cross section in the dented region was also described using the model in jones and shen 1992 different formulas for the denting resistance of tubes have been proposed in the literature the forms of which may vary from empirical to semi empirical and closed form solutions if no extra information is given on the shape of the indenter the indenter should be considered to be wedge shaped for a line contact b 0 and rectangular shaped for a nonzero contact width b furnes and amdahl 1980 defined the following relationship between the indenting force r and the depth of penetration w d 2 r 15 1 4 σ y t 2 d t 2 w d d where σ y is the material yield stress d is the tube dimeter and t is the wall thickness the model is also adopted in the api rp 2a wsd api rp2a wsd 2014 rules amdahl 1980 proposed a local denting model based on a plastic yield line analysis relating the denting resistance to local indentation the contact width effect was included by fitting with experimental data this model uses a flat indenter to represent the ship end or side and the tube is dented with a flattened top section the model is adopted in norsok n 004 and the denting resistance takes the following form 3 r r c 22 1 2 b d w d d 1 925 3 5 b d 4 3 1 1 4 1 n n p 3 where b is the contact width of the indenter the last term was borrowed from wierzbicki and suh 1988 to account for the effect of axial functional loads in the leg r c is a characteristic resistance of the tube and is defined as 4 r c σ y t 2 4 d t ellinas and walker 1983 investigated both local denting and global bending deformation of tubular members the expression for denting resistance of tubes is empirical 5 r k 1 4 σ y t 2 w d d 1 2 k is a constant coefficient representing the shape of the indenter and is normally assumed to be 150 according to experimental observations for concentrated loads wierzbicki and suh 1988 made the first attempt to derive a closed form solution for the indentation resistance of tubes under combined loading in the form of lateral indentation bending moment and axial force the problem was decoupled into the bending and stretching of a series of unconnected rings and generators the deformed tube sectional shape in fig 14 b was used the indentation resistance reads 6 r 16 2 π 3 d t w d d 1 4 σ y t 2 1 1 4 1 n n p 3 a big advantage of this expression is that it is theoretically derived but still preserves a simple form according to the formula of wierzbicki and suh 1988 a tube s ability to resist local denting depends on tube thickness and material yield stress but is not related to tube diameter yu and amdahl 2018 followed the derivation of wierzbicki and suh 1988 and extended the model to account for distributed loads with a contact width of b the following equation was obtained 7 r 16 2 π 3 d t w d d 1 1 4 1 n n p 3 b d 1 4 σ y t 2 in a nondimensional format it reads 8 r r c 16 2 π 3 w d d 1 1 4 1 n n p 3 b d t d cho cho 1987 1990 proposed an empirical equation for denting resistance considering contact width 9 r m 0 2 0 d t 0 2 e σ y 0 5 w d d 0 45 exp 0 1 b d w d d 0 3 where m 0 1 4 σ y t 2 buldgen et al 2014 and jones and shen 1992 presented analytical solutions for the complete behaviors of tubular members including local denting global bending and membrane stretching for local denting buldgen et al 2014 extended the model of wierzbicki and suh 1988 to consider different struck tube orientations and positions and the shape of the striking ship stem the denting model of jones and shen 1992 requires numerical iterations the expressions are complicated and are omitted here the above equations for the indentation resistance of tubes have all been verified to some extent by comparison with experimental results or numerical simulations when they were proposed the norsok model in eq 3 is widely used because it covers the contact width effect reasonable accuracy was found in general by amdahl et al 2012 travanca and hao 2014b and watan 2011 etc yu and amdahl 2018 carried out extensive numerical simulations for rigid indenters and deformable ship sterns crushing into tubular members of various dimensions and verified the denting models against simulation results they found that the denting models which considered only concentrated loads predicted the resistance quite accurately detailed comparisons were made especially for the norsok model in eq 3 the cho model in eq 9 and the modified wierzbicki and suh model in eq 8 considering the contact width effect in fig 15 results showed that the norsok model and the cho model tended to underestimate resistance for cases with large contact widths and the underestimation increased with increasing tube wall thickness for the norsok model the modified wierzbicki and suh model showed good prediction accuracy for both small and large contact widths more recently zhang et al 2018 carried out a series of drop hammer impact tests on clamped end tubular members three different impact indenter shapes were used namely wedge shaped hemispherical and cylindrical indenters the experiments showed different local deformations in the dented region with different indenters unfortunately a comparison of resistance curves and energy absorption capacities for different indenter shapes was not provided based on the experimental data the authors fitted an equation for the denting resistance of tubular members with increasing indentation depths the fitted equation is however not recommended because the indentation resistance in the equation is linearly proportional to indentation depth and also depends on tube length which contradicts most previous research and experimental observations the shape of damage in the dented zone was theoretically studied by wierzbicki and suh 1988 and an expression for the deflection of the leading generator at any location x was obtained 10 w w d 1 x ξ 2 where the transverse extension of damage along the tube length ξ is 11 ξ π d 2 w d 6 t the obtained shape of the lateral deflection of the leading generator and the shape of the dent correlated well with the experiments by smith 1982 referring to fig 16 5 1 2 local indentation resistance of ring stiffened columns ring stiffened columns have large diameter over thickness ratios and therefore deformation is mainly governed by local indentation design equations for ring stiffened columns subjected to collisions have not been officially given in the commonly used design standards an indication of strength design of large diameter columns against ship impacts is given in the commentary part of dnv rp c204 standard dnv gl 2018 where the design collision force intensity follows a pressure area relationship similar to that used for ice loads and the details can be found in hong et al 2009 and storheim and amdahl 2014 for ductile and shared energy designs more investigations are required ring stiffened columns are often subjected to local buckling of the shell wall between the rings and in plane buckling of the rings under external pressure design equations to preclude local buckling of ring stiffened columns are given in the api rp2a wsd api rp2a wsd 2014 rules experimental studies on the behavior of ring stiffened cylinders subjected to lateral indentation were carried out in refs cerik et al 2015 harding and onoufriou 1995 karroum et al 2007a b walker et al 1987 1988 a few analytical models have been proposed to predict the resistance to structural indentations for ring stiffened columns the ring stiffeners are typically treated in two ways 1 as discrete stiffeners 2 by smearing the stiffener thickness into the attached plate ronalds and dowling 1987 undertook a plastic analysis of an orthogonally stiffened cylindrical shell with lateral line loading at the mid span in the analysis the shell was assumed to act as a series of rings and longitudinal beams the results compared reasonably with their model tests the formulation however yields complicated expressions for design and may also require further validations fatt and wierzbicki 1991 proposed a procedure to calculate indentation resistance of ring stiffened columns the unstiffened tube was based on the wierzbicki and suh 1988 model the effect of strengthening stiffeners was accounted for using a discrete approach and the smeared method cerik et al 2015 modified the membrane term of the smeared model by fatt and wierzbicki 1991 to account for the boundaries of their tests free to rotate and axially deformable at both ends of ring stiffened columns the modified formulation predicted the resistance of their results quite well but overestimated the resistance for densely stiffened cylinders when compared with experiments by harding and onoufriou 1995 note that the ring stiffened column models in most of the experiments had short lengths hence after some time the longitudinal deformation pattern and resistance were influenced by displacements of the boundaries in reality ring stiffened columns are quite long and the propagation of deformations along a column s length is little influenced by the column s boundaries the diameters of ring stiffened columns are generally large in cases of beam and stern end collisions the assumption of a wide indenter adopted in previous experimental and theoretical studies should be valid refer to fig 17 b for ship bow bulb and stern end impacts however the deformations of columns may be concentrated in local regions refer to fig 17 a and the developed analysis models will be optimistic regarding column resistance 5 2 residual bending capacity of dented tubes a tube with clamped end supports will deform into a three hinge mechanism when the impact loads exceed the plastic bending collapse load the maximum lateral load r 0 can be obtained using the classical plasticity theory and is r 0 8 m p l m p is the plastic moment capacity of the tube cross section and is m p σ y d 2 t for an undamaged thin walled member however the maximum bending capacity often cannot be reached at the cross sections of the ends and the contact region at the supports the rear side of the cross section experiences significant compression and may induce local buckling whereas the front side is subjected to large stretching and may cause fracture this has been observed in experiments amdahl 1980 1983 as shown in fig 18 in addition the shear effect will become important for short beams and will reduce the maximum bending capacity of the cross section at the beam ends see jones 2011 in the contact region local indentation of the tube cross section brings about a reduction in the section modulus and produces an eccentricity about the neutral axis over the damaged region the combined effect induces a significant loss in load carrying capacity considering the deterioration effects at the supports and the contact region the effective maximum lateral load that a dented tube with clamped supports can carry is then expressed by 12 r 0 e f f 4 m p l γ 1 γ 2 where γ 1 and γ 2 are the effective bending capacity coefficients of the tube cross sections at the supports and the dented region respectively as suggested in foss and edvardsen 1982 γ 2 m r e s m p and m res is the residual bending capacity of a dented cross section a few models are available from the literature for the bending moment reduction of a dented cross section the norsok n004 standard norsok 2004 conservatively assumes that the flat part of a dented cross section is non effective which yields 13 m r e s m p cos θ 2 1 2 sin θ θ arccos 1 2 w d d taby 1986 presented a model for the ultimate strengths of dented tubular members subjected to axial compression and bending it was first assumed that a certain initial longitudinal compressive stress σpd is needed to obtain initial plastification of the damaged part of the tube s cross section once σpd has been exceeded in the damaged fibers they become ineffective and any additional bending is carried by the remaining effective section the model was implemented in a program named denta and was later adopted in usfos ellinas and walker 1983 presented an expression for the residual bending capacity of dented tubes which partly adopted taby 1986 s assumption the resulting expression yields 14 m r e s m p cos β β β w d d 1 σ d p σ y σ d p σ y d t 16 9 w d d 2 t d 2 4 3 w d d cho et al 2010 proposed an empirical equation by a regression analysis of results from a series of bending tests with dented tubes at a relatively small scale 15 m r e s m p exp 0 04 w d d 0 7 d t b d 0 1 buldgen et al 2014 formulated a moment reduction equation considering the relative positions of the striking ship and the dented tube cross section considering a simple right angle ship collision on a horizontal tube the expression becomes 16 m r e s m p 1 2 w d d 2 1 w d d 2 jones and shen 1992 proposed an equation for the development of bending moment with increasing local indentation as 17 w d d 1 2 π cos ϕ cos ϕ sin ϕ 2 2 ϕ sin ϕ m r e s m p π 2 2 ϕ sin ϕ 2 f ϕ f ϕ 2 sin ϕ sin ϕ 2 sin ϕ 1 cos ϕ the above models for bending moment reduction due to local denting are compared in fig 19 the d t ratio of the tube was set to 30 for the models by taby 1986 ellinas and walker 1983 and cho et al 2010 which are d t dependent considerable differences appear to exist for different models the models by norsok standard norsok 2004 and ellinas and walker 1983 predict small values the norsok model is conservative because there is no contribution from the dented part the expression by cho et al 2010 represents pretty well the mean strength obtained in tests the coefficient of variation for all dent ranges based on tests of their own and tests by ueda and rashed 1985 and paik and shin 1989 was estimated to be 8 for design purposes it is suggested to use a characteristic strength corresponding to the 5 quantile this yields approximately 84 of the values plotted in fig 19 but the values should be larger for small dents taby 1986 checked the bending resistance indirectly through axial compression tests he obtained excellent agreement with the tests and as such demonstrated the validity of the denting model the residual strength curves by cho and taby confirm each other in the sense that they exhibit the same trends thus for design purposes the use of the taby usfos curve seems reasonable the residual capacities predicted by buldgen et al 2014 and jones and shen 1992 have a different trend and seem to be too optimistic for the dent range of interest the situation is somewhat similar to dented offshore pipelines a review of the residual ultimate strength of offshore pipelines with structural damage can be found in cai et al 2017 5 3 transition from local denting to global bending a brace leg deforms first by local denting in the contact region and the increasing local indentation continuously decreases the plastic bending collapse load there exists a transition indentation ratio wd tran d beyond which the tube will initiate global bending upon further deformation the beam plastic resistance may remain constant or increase depending on the tube boundary conditions see fig 20 a and b for very thin walled tubes the resistance decreases further as denting continues in the beam bending stage de oliveira et al 1982 derived the analytical expression for the transition ratio from local denting to global bending as 18 w d t r a n d 2 k k 2 1 where 19 k 1 π 4 l d 2 d t ellinas and walker 1983 gave a more complicated expression for the transition indentation by solving the following equations 20 w d t r a n d 16 k d l d t 1 cos β β 2 where 21 β 1 d t 16 9 w d t r a n d 2 t d 2 4 3 w d t r a n d w d t r a n d yu and amdahl 2018 proposed an expression for the transition indentation ratio considering the effect of distributed loads over a contact length of b the transition indentation ratio is obtained by solving 22 r 0 2 r c 1 1 w d t r a n d w d t r a n d w d t r a n d 2 22 1 2 b d w d t r a n d 1 925 3 5 b d where 23 r 0 r c 32 d t d l b yu and amdahl 2018 found that the rear side of the struck tube would contract during local denting due to ovalization of tube cross sections see fig 14 c and the nodal velocity at the rear side would thus not continuously increase this made it easier to separate the denting and bending stages they verified the analytical expressions for the transition ratio using numerical results and good agreement was obtained in general for the three models the transition indentation ratio wd tran d depends on r 0 r c according to the models by de oliveira et al 1982 and yu and amdahl 2018 r 0 r c varies with powers of 3 2 1 2 and 1 for the diameter thickness and length of a brace leg respectively another important factor is the contact width b on one hand it reduces the effective length when calculating r 0 and therefore yields a larger r 0 r c and subsequently a larger wd tran d on the other hand the capability to resist local denting is enhanced with increasing contact width which reduces the wd tran d the decreasing tendency seems to be dominant with increasing contact widths fig 21 shows the variations in transition indentation ratios over wide ranges of l d and d t by using de oliveira et al 1982 s model l d was varied from 5 to 60 and d t from 10 to 80 it was found that the large transition indentation ratios concentrated in the region with small l d and large d t values according to the numerical simulation results in yu and amdahl 2018 there exists a threshold value of the wd tran d below which almost no local denting occurs before bending a threshold value of 0 15 was recommended by yu and amdahl 2018 the concept of transition ratio aids in understanding the dominant deformation patterns local denting bending or combined denting and bending given certain tube dimensions global bending commences once the transition indentation is reached but this does not mean local denting will cease immediately fig 22 shows the nodal displacements on the front and rear sides of a tube from which local denting may still increase after initiation of global deflections it is therefore not a good criterion to keep a tube cross section compact by limiting the transition ratio to a small value 5 4 bending and membrane stretching of tubes tubes will start global bending and deflect laterally when the transition indentation is reached for tubes with clamped boundaries membrane force increases with increasing lateral deflections and later becomes dominant up to fracture if the adjacent members and joints have sufficient strengths against being pulled in based on a rigid plastic analysis guedes soares and søreide 1983 presented an analytical model for the resistance of laterally loaded tubular members local indentation is assumed to be small and negligible the interaction effect of bending moment and axial force is considered for a perfect tubular cross section the interaction function yields 24 m m p cos π 2 n n p 0 where mp is the plastic bending moment of the cross section and np is the plastic yielding force of the cross section in tension the following expression for the resistance deflection relationship is obtained 25 r r 0 1 w b d 2 w b d arcsin w b d w b d 1 π 2 w b d w b d 1 where w b is the lateral deflection of the beam this model shows very good agreement for minor denting cases but the difference becomes large with increasing local indentations de oliveria 1981 presented a beam deformation model for tubes considering the axial and rotational flexibilities at the supports the interaction between bending moment and axial membrane forces was accounted for and local indentation was neglected the results showed that the axial stiffness at the supports was very important for the development of membrane forces in the tubes especially for cases with large lateral transverse displacements the influence of finite axial stiffness is also included analytically in the updated dnv rp c204 standard dnv gl 2018 where the expressions slightly simplified for the lateral deflection resistance of tubular members with finite axial stiffness and fixed rotations at the supports yield 26 r r 0 1 n n p π 2 π 2 n n p w b d n n p 1 π 2 w b d n n p 1 where the development of axial forces with lateral deflections is 27 n n p w b d 1 c 1 e c w b d n n p 1 c is the non dimensional spring stiffness the effect of rotational stiffness should be small in practice and is limited by plastic bending moment the bending moment tends to become insignificant at large deformations when the membrane force dominates the above expressions are based on perfect tubular cross sections neglecting local denting it should be noted that for braces supported by strong tubular joints and adjacent structures the effect of local indentation becomes negligible when axial membrane force dominates and the resistance will finally converge to the solution with perfect cross sections in pure tension for legs local indentation can be substantial whereas the development of axial membrane forces compared to the yield axial force is limited it may be useful to assume constant forces in the beam bending stage see fig 21 a a few researchers have proposed analytical solutions for the lateral deflection resistance of tubular members considering a dented cross section such as ellinas and walker 1983 jones and shen 1992 buldgen et al 2014 etc ellinas and walker 1983 assumed that local denting ceased immediately when the tube started global bending the ultimate lateral load was reached when the tube started global bending and the force was kept constant afterwards by neglecting the development of membrane forces jones and shen 1992 considered three deformation stages of local denting global bending and membrane stretching and allowed local denting deformations to continue in the global deformation phase the resulting expressions are however complicated for design purposes generally good agreement was obtained with the maximum permanent transverse displacements from experimental tests in jones et al 1992 in which results from a series of static and dynamic impacts for tubes with various dimensions were reported they found that regardless of whether bending or local denting governed the tube deformation the dimensionless dissipated strain energy changed almost linearly with the maximum permanent transverse displacement similar findings were reported by travanca and hao 2014b through extensive numerical simulations buldgen et al 2014 presented an analytical solution considering the complete behaviors including local denting global bending and membrane stretching the different orientations and positions of the struck tube and the shape of the striking ship stem were accounted for the proposed method was verified to be of reasonable accuracy using finite element software ls dyna it is not clear whether it is important to consider tube orientation and stem shape but accounting for the two factors makes the expressions rather complicated le sourne et al 2015 carried out a numerical analysis of an offshore wind turbine jacket impacted by a supply vessel and found that for the leg impact case the impacted leg dissipated approximately 60 of the total internal energy some plastic strains also developed in the legs extremities and the rear leg could be punched by the connected braces it is therefore not a good approximation to assume that all the energy is dissipated through deformations of the impacted leg based on the observations le sourne et al 2016 derived analytical expressions for energy absorption in two additional scenarios other than that wherein the impacted leg was laterally deformed the first considered a leg punched by one or several compressed braces and the second considered the buckling of a rear compressed leg near the mudline during the overall deformation of the jacket based on the concept of the super element method they proposed an efficient method that included simplified solutions for local denting global bending axial stretching brace punching and buckling the proposed method was verified to be of reasonable accuracy with a few cases using ls dyna for the same wind turbine jacket from which they obtained the idealized displacement fields the transferability to other platforms needs further investigations another concern with respect to the work is that application of simplified methods to regions far away from the impacted location may not be safe for structural design because many uncertainties are not captured by the idealized model such as fracture and failure and force redistribution throughout the entire structure after member failure tubular pipes containing liquid gas or granular materials that are often pressurised have similar structural performances when subjected to lateral impacts the material contents in pipes will provide inertia resistance to deformation through the added mass effect and the effect increases with increasing density of the contents jones and birch 2010 showed that increasing internal pressure caused a small reduction in the maximum permanent transverse displacement but caused an important reduction in impact energy for failure more research on the lateral impacts of matter filled pipes can be found in refs jones and birch 1996 ma and stronge 1985 nishida and tanaka 2006 palmer et al 2006 5 5 influence of axial pre compression and boundary conditions tubular members especially platform legs are often preloaded to some extent by carrying the weight of the platform and additional environmental loads the effect of axial pre compression is two fold i the axial force will reduce the plastic bending moment of the cross section and the denting resistance ii during finite lateral deformation it will create additional bending moments it is noticed that in many cases the axial stress is small compared to the yield strength such that the first effect is small furthermore many platforms possess significant redistribution capabilities so that the axial force in a leg is reduced when the leg deforms this can be well illustrated by fig 23 in which an offshore jacket was impacted by a vessel on the leg both static and dynamic analyses were carried out using usfos the static analysis in fig 23 a shows that a buckled brace fairly distant from the contact region can cause force redistribution throughout the entire platform and can be important in resisting collision loads the dynamic analysis results from fig 23 b by skallerud and amdahl 2002 showed that the plastic deformation of the leg caused the axial force in the leg to unload its share of the topside weight in the extreme it became tensile by simple equilibrium the opposite leg had to unload the net result was that the two central legs had to carry the entire weight of the platform most investigators have studied the behaviors of tubular members with constant preloads thus implicitly assuming a non redundant structure wierzbicki and suh 1988 presented a closed form solution for the indentation resistance of tubes under combined axial forces and bending moment as shown in eq 6 the last term represents the degradation effect of the load carrying capacity of preloaded tubes the theory predicted a threshold force ratio of n np 0 5874 np is the ultimate strength of the tube in tension below which no lateral forces can be equilibrated by the system norsok n004 norsok 2004 considered the strength reduction due to axial compression loading by introducing an effective factor k 28 k 1 0 n s d n r d 0 2 1 0 2 n s d n r d 0 2 0 2 n s d n r d 0 6 0 n s d n r d 0 6 where nsd and nrd are the design axial compressive force and resistance respectively in order for the above equations to be valid no local buckling of the tube cross section shall occur local buckling of unstiffened tubular cross sections can be checked according to the api rule api rp2a wsd 2014 and dnv gl rp c204 dnv gl 2018 standard both rules indicate significant dependence on the diameter over thickness ratio d t the api rule api rp2a wsd 2014 requires that unstiffened cylindrical members with d t greater than 60 should be investigated for elastic and inelastic local buckling of cross sections under axial compression by means of finite element analyses khedmati and nazari 2012 preloaded tubes to force levels of 0 100 of the yield strength and found that the compressive loads significantly degraded the ultimate strength and energy absorption capabilities of the tubes the ultimate strength of tubular members was found to increase when the impact position moved from the middle towards the end however the tubes tend to fracture early and absorb less energy as shown in the experiments by jones et al 1992 the effect of preloading was also studied experimentally and numerically in zeinoddini et al zeinoddini et al 1998 2002 2008 2008 zeinoddini et al 2002 numerical and experimental results from khedmati and nazari 2012 and zeinoddini et al zeinoddini et al 1998 1999 2008 2002 indicated that contrary to the theory predicted by wierzbicki and suh 1988 a member with an axial compressive preloading exceeding 0 5874np could still resist some lateral load the reason may be that the equation proposed by wierzbicki and suh 1988 was obtained by assuming no global rotation in the member which is questionable for the real behavior of a tube zeinoddini et al 1998 the effects of three different boundaries conditions at the supports were investigated by numerical simulation in khedmati and nazari 2012 and zeinoddini et al 1998 the considered boundary conditions were type 1 with free axial sliding and rotation type 2 with free sliding and fixed rotation and type 3 with fixed sliding and rotation typical resistance displacement curves are shown in fig 24 the resistances of tubes under type 1 and 2 conditions have clear maximum values and the governing deformation modes are local denting and beam bending for type 3 the resistance increases continuously with lateral deflections due to significant membrane forces however none of the above three types of boundary conditions provide a good representation of the boundaries of braces and legs in real platforms a more realistic representation of the boundary conditions may be to assume finite axial and rotational stiffnesses at the supports the axial stiffness governs the development of membrane forces and influences the total resistance significantly qvale 2012 and watan 2011 considered the axial stiffness of jacket legs when analyzing supply vessel side and stern collisions with jacket platforms they removed the struck leg from the platform in usfos and applied axial forces at the end nodes see fig 25 a the axial stiffness was taken as the tangent of the obtained force displacement curve and then implemented in the ls dyna model as the spring stiffness see fig 25 b results showed that the force decreased when considering axial flexibilities compared to that under clamped end conditions the reduction was especially significant for weak columns because they experienced large deformations rotational springs are needed for better representation of the boundaries a more accurate way to represent the boundary conditions of a member may be to properly model the tubular joints and adjacent tubular members 6 responses of tubular members subjected to axial compression supporting braces can be loaded axially during collisions especially when a ship collides onto a platform tubular joint e g wang et al 2016 responses of circular tubes under compression have been investigated by many researchers especially as energy absorbers in the automobile industry a few review articles on thin walled structures as energy absorbers can be found in refs abramowicz 2003 alghamdi 2001 olabi et al 2007 a series of experiments was carried out on steel and aluminum tubes of different dimensions that were loaded quasi statically and dynamically such as guillow et al 2001 karagiozova and jones 2008 andrews et al 1983 and abramowicz and jones 1997 depending on tube dimensions boundary conditions and impact velocities circular tubes behave quite differently fig 26 shows three main deformation patterns from experiments the axisymmetric mode also known as concertina mode the asymmetric mode also called diamond mode and the global bending mode due to euler buckling some tubes may exhibit combined deformation modes andrews et al 1983 summarized the experimental results and presented a classification chart of the deformation modes of quasi statically compressed aluminum alloy tubes see fig 27 similar charts can also be found in guillow et al 2001 the experiments showed that the initial buckling phase is decisive in forming the energy absorption mechanisms a static critical tube length l c r s t a t i c exists for a particular diameter over thickness ratio d t such that tubes shorter than that length collapse progressively whereas longer tubes develop a global bending mode in general tubes used in offshore jacket and jack up platforms have large length over diameter ratios l d and deform mainly in the global bending mode abramowicz and jones 1997 and karagiozova and alves 2004 showed that the critical length for buckling transition increased when the tubes were loaded dynamically this was attributed to the increased lateral inertia of the shell however in ship platform collisions impact velocities are generally low and the dynamic effects are secondary foss and edvardsen 1982 compared the energy absorption capabilities of offshore tubular members subjected to lateral impacts and axial compression considering different boundary conditions the test results showed that a compression member absorbed energy similar to that for a bending member and may be treated as a bending member for energy absorption purposes large diameter thin walled cylinders are also commonly used as compression elements in offshore installations such as semi submersibles spars and more recently as buoyancy columns for floating offshore wind turbine foundations they are often stiffened with ring stiffeners and or stringers for such members progressive buckling modes may develop analytical solutions for the average collapse load of the axisymmetric and asymmetric models in fig 26 have been provided by alexander 1960 and johnson et al 1977 respectively amdahl and søreide 1981 studied the axial crushing of a cylindrical bulbous bow stiffened with transverse frames longitudinal stringers and a centerline bulkhead the method proposed by gerard 1958 that cuts cross sections into simple elements was found to agree well with experimental curves further discussion is omitted 7 behavior of tubular joints the integrity of tubular joints is crucial to ensure the smooth transfer of the collision forces from the impact location to the adjacent structures in the initial stages the hit brace or leg deforms by bending whereas braces may develop significant axial tension forces during finite deformations in addition legs may sometimes be capable of completely unloading the axial compressions induced by the functional loads and develop some tension but the tension forces will be small compared to the yield forces the ultimate load carrying capacities of tubular joints determine to a large extent the amounts of energy absorbed by bracing members failure of tubular joints may be caused by buckling of the chord excessive deformations or the initiation and propagation of cracks the capacities of tubular joints are typically expressed in code requirements for offshore structures e g iso 19902 iso 2007 api rp 2a wsd api rp2a wsd 2014 and norsok n004 norsok 2004 three characteristic actions are often considered compression or tension in plane bending ipb and out of plane bending opb normally opb predominates for impact actions combined axial force ipb and opb are considered through interaction formulas the effect of axial force in the chord i e the leg is also taken into account it is distinguished by three different joint categories x k and t joints the classification depends on the load transfer the behavior of x k and t joints up to peak capacity is given as a nonlinear force displacement moment rotation curve according to the formulations developed in joint industry projects carried out by msl engineering ltd msl engineering ltd 1996 2000 considering also the tension ductility limits the actual behavior of tubular joints may be a combination of the three load categories and the contribution from each category may vary during the impact hence the joint may need to be constantly reclassified during the collision action this approach is adopted in usfos it is noted that joint classification and resistance are based on the plane of action neglecting the effect of out of plane braces the approach is considered to be conservative for multi planar joints this circumstance and the fact that capacity formulas are based on characteristic resistances make it likely that the use of shell element modelling of joints in a nonlinear finite element analysis of a ship impact will yield larger joint capacities than those given in the design codes a collision analysis based on shell finite element modelling of a joint and braces framing into the joint of a jacket was carried by notaro et al 2015 using abaqus explicit the colliding object was assumed to be the pontoon bow of a semi submersible platform the pontoon bow was also modelled with shell finite elements which allowed a significantly better simulation of the contact area and dent growth the investigation confirmed a somewhat higher resistance of the t joint in the fe analysis compared to the usfos use of code formulations the multi planar effect was probably low in the present case because of the simple joint geometry and only two out of plane braces notaro et al 2015 also simulated a direct hit on a joint that induced local denting of the chord wall the simple local denting formulations used in the beam models are not intended to include chord walls in tubular joints the damage obtained in the fe analysis was smaller but in the same order of magnitude part of the difference was also attributed to more realistic development of the contact area and dent in the fe simulations 8 ultimate strength of damaged tubes depending on impact intensity and tube strength tubular members will absorb impact energy by developing deformations of the following forms 1 local denting of the tube wall without overall bending of the member 2 overall bending without denting of the tube wall 3 combined overall bending and denting deformations the damage types seem to be governed by the transition ratio as discussed in section 5 3 the damaged tubular members may be subjected to various loading conditions during platform operations which may include axial compression bending combined axial compression and bending and combined axial compression and hydrostatic pressure a series of axial compression tests of damaged tubes both at a small scale and at full scale was carried out by smith et al 1979 1980 1981 the results indicated that the small scale experiments provided satisfactory accuracy when compared to the full scale tests the ultimate strength of the slightly damaged members was significantly less than that of the undamaged ones for tubes with only overall bending damage an elastoplastic beam column analysis smith et al 1979 showed good correlation with test results for tubes with local indentations they proposed a semi empirical method based on the experiments by introducing an effective modulus and yield stress in the dented region taby et al 1981 taby and moan 1985 and yao et al 1988 proposed an analytical numerical model of a damaged tubular member subjected to axial compression based on yield line theory the theory was later adopted in usfos the tubes were loaded incrementally after initial plastification the dented region was assumed to be ineffective and an additional load increase was carried by the elastoplastic behavior of the undamaged part of the dented cross section plastic hinges were introduced when the ultimate strength was reached the incremental load deformation relationship in the post ultimate stage was formulated in the form of stiffness matrices the interaction between bending moment and axial forces was considered where the dent was in compression a series of axial compression tests on damaged tubes was carried out in 1980 and 1983 and was reported in taby and moan 1985 and taby 1986 the experimental results showed that dent depth increased significantly in the post ultimate stage and the force dropped rapidly see fig 28 an empirical function was derived to account for the growth in dent depth after calibration the model compared reasonably well with the experiments considering the general loading case the resultant bending moment of the dented cross section may have an arbitrary angle with respect to the dent this was considered in ueda and rashed 1985 they derived an ultimate strength interaction relationship of a dented tube member subjected to axial force and bending moment in two perpendicular directions a series of bending tests of dented tubes was carried out the results showed that the effect of a dent on the ultimate strength reduction was predominant when the dent was in compression the effect was less when the dent was in tension or at the neutral axis the predicted results agreed reasonably well with the experiments ellinas 1984 presented a simple method for estimating the reserved strength of damaged tubes with local denting damage overall beam deflection and combined local denting and overall deflection damage the method showed a clear lower bound when compared to previous experiments and was conservative for safety considerations a parametric study was carried out and showed that the behavior of damaged tubular members was highly influenced by the column slenderness parameter λ r the dent depth and the overall bending imperfection the ultimate strength reduction caused by initial local denting damage was potentially more important for cases with small λ r and small bending imperfections unlike the previous analytical models assuming ineffectiveness of the dented region after initial plastification durkin 1987 represented fibers inside the dents as a series of longitudinal strips with a deflection shape that was characteristic of a beam on an elastic foundation combined axial loading and bending moments were assumed the ultimate strength was reached when a point of plastic instability occurred during iterations and the stress level was maximized the predicted results of the models were compared with experiments and numerical simulations and the differences of the ultimate strength values were reported to be within 5 the behavior of dented tubular members with and without considering local buckling and residual stresses was also analyzed by duan et al 1993 1990 using an empirical analytical moment curvature approach the effect of residual stress in the dented region is often considered to be negligible in the analytical models pacheco and durkin 1988 carried out experimental and numerical studies on the behavior of dented tubular members and showed that the exclusion of the residual stress effect will lead to small underestimations of residual strength the underestimation was likely to be substantial for tubes with large dents 9 design considerations 9 1 the design philosophy a crashworthy structure against ship impacts implies a structure that is designed such that it is capable of withstanding collisions without global collapse the energy may be absorbed either by plastic straining of the structure itself or by deforming the striking ship according to dnv rp c204 2010 when designing offshore structures against accidental ship impacts significant structural deformations may be allowed provided that the damage does not lead to progressive collapse of the structures or destroy the usability of escape ways the platform after the impact should preserve sufficient load carrying capacities to resist environmental and functional loads before it is repaired it can be very challenging both numerically and physically to pursue structural behavior until total collapse of the system e g significant uncertainties exist regarding actual ductility limits for members and joints and how to model them in theoretical analyses hence it has become customary to design components and subsystems to resist characteristic ship collision actions and relevant permanent and environmental loads both during damage and in post damage conditions so that they undergo substantial damage but still have considerable margins against complete failure the design of platform braces legs against ship impacts may be carried out in the ductile shared energy or strength design domain dnv rp c204 2010 see fig 29 strength design the installation is strong enough to resist collision forces with minor deformation so that the ship is forced to deform and dissipate the major part of the energy ductility design the installation undergoes large plastic deformation and dissipates the major part of the collision energy shared energy design both the installation and the ship contribute significantly to energy dissipation the governing factor is the resistance to plastic collapse in bending r 0 if the resistance is larger than the force that the ship will produce when penetrated by a rigid tube the ship will predominantly dissipate the collision energy i e the brace leg response is in the strength domain however the brace leg must also comply with local denting compactness requirements otherwise the ship s resistance to penetration will be larger than the residual bending collapse resistance of a dented tube if r 0 is less than the ship s resistance to penetration the brace leg will be in the shared energy or ductile domain depending on the brace leg dimensions and material strength it may dissipate considerable energy by beam bending and membrane forces at large deformations local denting will contribute to the energy dissipation as well however it may be advisable to avoid significant local denting because local denting reduces total energy absorption and responses for denting beyond brace leg radius are uncertain with little denting simple equations apply as stated before unless further evaluations are performed the kinetic energy for a bow impact should be 50 mj according to the new version norsok n003 standard norsok 2017 this energy level cannot be absorbed by a single brace or leg a viable option is to design the braces to have sufficient strength to penetrate the bow so that the ship can dissipate considerable energy which falls into the shared energy or strength design domain 9 2 ship platform interaction within the shared energy domain the response and energy absorption of the striking and struck objects are very sensitive to their relative strengths and failure of a single structural component may turn the strong structure into the weak to capture the ship platform interactions accurately an integrated analysis of platform and ship structures modelled with shell elements is required proper modelling of the material properties and fracture is essential refer to section 2 2 during collisions the softer structure will deform and the impact force will be distributed over a larger contact area this increases the resistance of the strong structure and therefore there will be an upward shift of the resistance curve to the stronger structure as shown in fig 30 in designing offshore platforms the load deformation curves of ships and platforms are often established independently by disregarding the relative strength and assuming that the other object is infinitely rigid shared energy design based on such independently obtained force curves may not yield the correct energy distributions to account for the ship platform interactions the new version dnv gl rp c204 dnv gl 2018 treats it empirically by introducing an energy dissipation correction factor β such that 29 e s β 0 w s max r s d w s 0 w i max r i d w i where r s and r i are the deformation resistances of the ship and the installation respectively 0 β 1 limits the energy dissipation capability of the structure travanca and hao 2015 tried three parameters k s m 0 k s k i and r c to represent the relative strengths of a striking ship and the struck installation and plotted energy dissipation proportions versus the relative strength factors based on numerical simulation k s and k i are the tangential stiffness of the force displacement curves of the ship and installation respectively they found that the thickness of the installation tubes played an important role in determining the platform energy absorption and that plastic bending moment of tube walls per unit width m 0 1 4 σ y t 2 could therefore be used to describe the platform relative strength it is difficult to find the proportion of energy dissipation in a platform and ship using simple methods during a ship collision the weaker structure may shift several times from one to the other in shared energy design the new version dnv gl rp c204 dnv gl 2018 relates the amount of energy dissipation in a ship bow to the collapse resistance in bending for the brace r 0 as shown in table 1 provided that the compactness requirement is satisfied the results shown in the table are based on a conservative consideration of a series of numerical simulation results this share of energy dissipation has not been extended to ship stern and broad side impacts 9 3 compactness requirements against excessive local dents a few requirements exist in the literature for a brace leg to maintain compactness during deformation sherman 1976 suggested that members with d t of 35 or less and l d up to 22 can be deemed to maintain full bending capacity during deformation based on experimental observations the api rules api rp2a 1977 prescribe d t 9000 σ y σ y in mpa to maintain full capacity trough plastic deformation for 9000 σ y d t 15200 σ y a limited plastic rotation capacity can be assumed the current norsok n004 norsok 2004 and dnv gl rp c204 dnv rp c204 2010 require the following compactness criterion to avoid excessive local denting of the tube before forming a three hinge collapse mechanism 30 r 0 r c 6 this criterion was shown to be overly conservative in storheim and amdahl 2014 based on observations of numerical simulation results they proposed to use r c as a characteristic strength factor the r c criterion was proved to be useful in travanca and hao 2015 through a series of numerical simulation cerik et al 2016 carried out a series of impact experiments and numerical simulations to study the responses of tubular members subjected to mass impacts a classification of the impact responses of tubular members is suggested by using the indicator of r0 rc the following four response categories are suggested mode 1 r 0 r c 6 5 dominated by global bending mode 2 6 5 r 0 r c 10 dominated by both local denting and beam deformation and local denting ceases immediately after plastic collapse mode 3 10 r 0 r c 23 dominated by both local denting and beam deformation and local denting continues after plastic collapse model 4 r 0 r c 23 dominated by local shell denting yu and amdahl 2018 found that the d t and l d requirements and the r0 rc criterion actually limited the transition indentation to a small value refer to section 5 3 but may not restrict the development of local denting in the beam bending stage they suggested using the rc criterion following the recommendations of storheim and amdahl 2014 and related to the maximum collision force f max when a ship s bow crushes a rigid brace leg 31 r c 1 9 f max 24 the criterion in eq 31 was shown to be useful for limiting the development of local indentation in the bending stage as well as through a series of numerical simulations rc is suggested to be 1 2 mn for stern corner impacts and 1 5 mn for stern end impacts the compactness criteria require more validation 9 4 residual strength of damaged platforms platforms after ship collision damage should be able to withstand operational loads and certain environmental loads without progressive collapse of the structures the strength capacities of damaged platforms should be checked refer to fig 31 dnv rp c104 dnv 2012 and api rp2a wsd api rp2a wsd 2014 require that a damaged platform shall survive environmental loads corresponding to a return period of no less than 1 year a more strict criterion is to require the damaged platform to survive the environmental loads with an annual exceedance probability of 10 2 according to moan 2009 which corresponds to the requirement for ultimate limit state design of an intact platform however in the damaged state the partial safety factors for loads and resistance can be taken as equal to unity a simple albeit conservative approach is to remove the struck member by assuming that it is completely ineffective after damage and then to undertake a push over analysis to check the platform residual strength refer to e g amdahl and johansen 2001 for dented tubes a few formulations exist refer to e g taby 1986 and ellinas 1984 that allow taking post damage strength into account naderi et al 2009 carried out a static pushover analysis of a jacket platform under both intact and damaged conditions using usfos the platform was a four legged production jacket with k braced frames located in the persian gulf the investigated damage on tubular structures encompassed dent depths of 0 25d 0 50d and 0 75d or out of straightnesses of 0 5 0 75 1 2 and 1 4 the results showed that the damaged platform had considerable redundancy to withstand external loads through force redistributions and the failure of one component would generally not limit the capacity of the structure as a whole the reserve capacity of an intact platform can be described by the reserve resistance factor ref 32 ref environmental loads at collapse undamaged design environmental loads the residual strength of a damaged offshore platform may be represented by the residual strength factor rsf which is defined as 33 rsf environmental loads at collapse damaged design environmental loads according to naderi et al 2009 the rsfs with failure of one member for the investigated jacket ranged over 1 4 to 2 1 depending on damage type extent and location where the design loads were selected as wave loads with a return period of 100 years the rsfs for an eight legged north sea jacket can range over 3 1 4 4 according to ghose et al 1994 similar conclusions were reported by sveen 1990 when a west german submarine collided with the eight legged oseberg b jacket on the norwegian continental shelf in 1988 the estimated energy of which was 5 6 mj collapse analysis of the damaged platform revealed high reserve strengths an rsf of approximately 2 3 for the jacket structure failure of several tubular members will further reduce the residual capacity of a damaged platform and threaten its global integrity an example is the big orange ekofisk 2 4 w collision psa 2009 after which the jacket had to be dismantled billington et al 1993 reviewed reserve residual and ultimate strength analyses of offshore structures before the 1990s the methods including analytical experimental and nonlinear finite element analyses used to evaluate the reserve and residual strengths of offshore platforms were summarized in addition to the damaged members the influence of nonlinear joint behavior platform foundations and realistic load distributions were highlighted in general ship collisions take place around the mean water level hence a platform s global resistance to environmental loads is only moderately affected because a significant part of the wave loads enters below the collision zone it is also essential for the residual strength such that the platform can allow for a complete loss of load carrying by the damaged legs either by redistributing the topside loads by diagonals to the adjacent legs as is the case for the platform in fig 32 or by the topside framework note that only two legs must carry the total topside loads for the damaged jacket in fig 32 10 conclusions and recommendations this paper presents a review of the structural response and design of offshore tubular structures subjected to ship impacts from the point of view of platform crashworthiness design significant changes have taken place since the first dnv rule for ship collisions in the 1980s notably the increased impact energy due to larger vessels and impact speeds and new ship designs such as bulbous bows x bows and ice strengthened vessels this has triggered a revision to the dnv rp c204 in 2017 the standard design energy has increased significantly to 50 mj for bow impacts 28 mj for broad side collisions and 22 mj for stern collisions in the new version norsok n003 standard to absorb such large amounts of energy strength design or shared energy design may be required for which a struck brace or leg must be capable of penetrating the bow such that the ship dissipates considerable energy collision analysis is often considered to be centric i e the impact force is directed through the center of gravity of the ship and floating platforms this is often a very credible scenario but sometimes it is overly conservative because part of the impact energy may be transferred into other motion components e g sway roll yaw and pitch external dynamics methods have been developed that often provide approximate but useful results for general eccentric collisions external dynamic models should be used with care for ship collisions with offshore braces and legs because tubular members may penetrate into the striking ship bow and lock the ship motions the dissipated energy predicted by external dynamic models can be much underestimated for cases with complex ship motions long durations or potential motion locking the coupled simulation method based on beam shell modelling with beam elements representing the global motion of the ship is promising and should be further developed any secondary impacts should also be considered in eccentric collisions jackets installed in shallow and moderately deep water are generally dominated by static responses deep water jackets and notably jack ups are more compliant and may absorb a considerable part of the energy by elastic deformation ship collision assessments of such platforms should be carried out using dynamic analysis during a collision energy absorption in the platform occurs mainly through lateral deformation of the struck and adjacent members buckling of compressed members and global motions of the platform the deformations of laterally impacted unstiffened tubular members will exhibit three deformation stages local denting global bending and membrane stretching the underlying mechanics of tube deformation and the ultimate strength of damaged tubes and platforms have been reviewed it was found that existing simplified models captured the main features of the denting process and the residual capacity of dented members subjected to bending and compression such models have been implemented in the beam column element formulation in the usfos computer program cross sectional denting will significantly degrade the bending capacities of tubular members therefore in order to obtain strength design it is essential to design a brace or leg so that it does not undergo large denting the extent of the local dent before entering the global bending stage can be described by the denting transition ratio compactness requirements in the literature were reviewed and the characteristic denting resistance factor rc was adopted as a compactness indicator in the new version dnv gl rp c204 if the strengths of the platform and ship fall in the shared energy domain significant ship platform interactions will occur and local denting of the struck tube will increase the ship s resistance to penetration the ship platform interaction effect is considered in the new version dnv gl rp c204 standard by introducing a correction factor β that is related to the denting resistance rc of tubulars the procedure developed to account for the interaction effect is simplified if more accurate calculations are required it is always possible to conduct nlfea simulations with shell element modelling of the hit member and the ship using explicit programs such as ls dyna and abaqus modelling ship structures is somewhat demanding the finite element library of a few supply vessels established by dnv gl and made available to the engineering community is very valuable for this purpose and it also standardizes the vessels used by different companies this will enhance greatly the use of explicit nlfea in the future the boundary conditions adopted for collision simulations need to be considered carefully alternatively analyses may be carried out using complete platform models preferably hybrid shell beam models should be used such that beam elements are utilized outside the region of primary damage depending on the studied problem and platform configurations shell modelling of several members and joints may be needed columns subjected to compression should contain imperfections that are carefully calibrated to code column curves shell modelling of tubular joints is cumbersome but it will allow for collision simulations against tubular joints where little information exists regarding resistance to impact it is also noted that tubular joints modelled with shell elements will generally produce ultimate bending capacities larger than those predicted by usfos in which joint strength is based on code formulations because the codes neglect the strengthening effect of multi planar joints because collision forces in most cases are considerably smaller than the extreme environmental loads soil capacity will most often not be challenged in such cases analysts can be significantly eased by skipping pile soil modelling and using pinned boundary conditions at the mud line this is generally conservative nlfea may be needed if contact takes place close to brace ends because the simplified dent models that have been developed may not be representative for behaviors in such cases there is room for the improvement of simplified methods for the determination of indentation resistance of ring and or axially stiffened columns e g for semi submersibles the formulations proposed have so far considered a knife edged rigid indenter for stern corner and bow bulb impacts contact forces will be more concentrated and the formulations for knife edge indenters may overpredict the resistance precise prediction of fracture is essential with respect to damage prediction and opening of compartments to flooding or cargo spills several models have been proposed and compared with experiments but room for improvement remains significant acknowledgments this work has been funded by the research council of norway rcn through the centers of excellence funding scheme project amos

23507,over the past decades the offshore oil and gas industry has developed rapidly a large number of offshore structures notably jacket and jack up platforms were constructed and installed worldwide as they are often exposed to safety threats from impacts by visiting vessels and dropped objects there has been a continuous interest in understanding the impact mechanics of tubular structures and proposing practical design standards to protect from collisions this paper reviews the state of the art with respect to the response dynamics and mechanics of offshore tubular structures subjected to

minor local structural deformation to major threats to structural integrity causing great economic loss severe environmental pollution and fatalities in extreme conditions accidental loads may cause the global collapse of entire structures and put human lives in jeopardy the huge losses from several catastrophic marine collision accidents such as the sinking of the titanic after hitting an iceberg and explosion of the mumbai high north platform after suffering a collision from a supply vessel have aroused continuous public concern regarding the operational safety of ships and offshore structures tremendous efforts have been made mainly in two directions 1 to reduce the probability of occurrence of ship collisions with the application of advanced navigational tools and administration procedures 2 to obtain crashworthy design of structures based on a thorough understanding of fundamental collision mechanics based on research outcomes rules and standards relevant for the design of crashworthy structures have been introduced e g dnv rp c204 2010 iso 19902 iso 2007 api rp2a wsd 2014 abs 2013 and hse 2004 the standards have been continuously updated to include novel knowledge and address new challenges a few review articles are available in the literature and they mainly focus on general procedures of risk analysis and structural assessments in ship collisions and groundings ellinas and valsgard 1985 moan and amdahl 1989 pedersen 2010 wang et al 2002 however no specific review exists that addresses the complicated collision mechanics of tubular structures the authors consider it highly important that researchers understand the theories and principles developed over the long time span so that they can provide a solid foundation for future research works it is therefore the purpose of this paper to bridge the gap in knowledge by presenting a comprehensive review of structural response assessments and design considerations specifically for offshore tubular structures in the accidental limit states als covering both classical references and more recent progress as well the review focuses especially on the norsok n 004 code and the dnv gl recommended practices for design against accidental loads because they contain the most detailed provisions design against extreme ship collision should be carried out in the accidental collapse limit state using risk based techniques moan 2009 the probability of system loss due to a collision of a certain intensity kinetic energy at a given location may be calculated as the product of the probability of collision with a given intensity and location multiplied with the probability of damage for the given event and the probability of system loss conditioned on the calculated damage of the structure subjected to relevant permanent loads and environmental loads it is necessary to integrate over all possible collision intensities and locations the calculated probability of system loss shall comply with the target safety level the target safety level considering all kinds of accidents implies a probability level for system loss in the range of 10 4 per year for als according to norsok n003 norsok 2017 with approximately ten different accidental categories collision accidents should therefore have an annual failure probability of 10 5 taking that into account the characteristic values are used for loads and resistance the conditional probability of failure for structures nominally at the brink of collapse is estimated to be in the range of 0 1 moan 2009 in practice it is very cumbersome to calculate the probability of failure for all intensity levels and locations simplifications are necessary it has therefore become customary to design the structure by a deterministic analysis of ship collisions with an annual probability of occurrence of 10 4 thus characteristic kinetic energy is typically determined via risk analysis as adopted in ship ship collisions analysis pedersen 2010 the design collision event that has been used for decades is the impact from a standard supply vessel with a displacement of 5000 tons travelling with a speed of 2 m s based on risk analysis this gives a design energy of 11 mj for bow impacts and 14 mj for broad side impacts considering added mass effects dnv rp c204 2010 over the years kinetic energy has increased significantly with the increased ship displacements and impact velocities identified in moan et al 2017 and kvitrud 2011 based on an overview of collision accidents in recent years moreover newly designed ship structures such as bulbous bows x bows and ice strengthened vessels may change impact consequences according to the new version norsok n003 standard norsok 2017 if no operational restrictions on allowable visiting vessel size are implemented supply ship displacements should not be selected less than 10 000 tons and unless further evaluations are performed the kinetic energy should be 50 mj for bow impacts 22 mj for stern impacts and 28 mj for broad side collisions this represents a substantial increase in the demand for collision resistance of an offshore structure the design scenarios of the new version norsok n003 standard with increased design energy may be classified as high energy collisions under high impact energies tubular members will undergo significant deformations and may fracture and fail threatening the integrity of the platform a noticeable example is the well workover vessel big orange xviii collision with the ekofisk 2 4 jacket platform in which the estimated kinetic energy was 60 mj the accident caused severe damage to the three legged jackets and also to the bow see fig 1 several braces were ruptured and the jacket had to be dismantled such high collision energies cannot be absorbed by a single member it is therefore essential to design tubular members such that they have sufficient strength to penetrate the bow and the ship bow absorbs considerable energy amdahl and johansen 2001 minor ship collisions and dropped objects often occur and cause small damage to the platform braces and legs according to taby 1986 operational damages occurring almost every year for north sea jackets are a dent depth of 10 of the tube diameter and or a permanent deflection of 0 004l where l is the span length of the member as timely repair of a damaged offshore structure is difficult and expensive it is important to have knowledge about the ultimate and post ultimate strength of damaged tubular members under various loading conditions so as to make optimal decisions regarding safety and economy a good illustration of minor ship collisions and subsequent damage assessment safety evaluation and repair was reported by sveen 1990 when a west german submarine collided with the eight legged oseberg b jacket on the norwegian continental shelf in 1988 with an estimated energy of 5 6 mj refer to fig 2 the struck diagonal brace absorbed 60 percent of the energy and suffered major damage with a large local dent and overall deflection a safety assessment of the undamaged and damaged platform was carried out using nonlinear finite element analysis nlfea the simulated accelerations and strain responses compared reasonably with data measured using the platform monitoring system during the collision the collapse analysis of the damaged platform revealed high reserve strength in jacket structures repairs to the platform by replacing the damaged brace were also reported the responses of offshore tubular structures subjected to ship impacts are complicated from various aspects e g local and global structural responses the residual strengths of damaged members and structures the behavior of tubular joints and static and dynamic effects from the perspective of energy dissipation the total energy should be dissipated through damage to both the ship and the platform there can be significant ship platform interactions depending on the relative strengths of both structures another important consideration for collisions is the response of braces and legs braces or legs in direct contact with a ship will undergo three deformation stages which are local denting global bending and membrane stretching see fig 3 and different deformation stages may interact depending on tube dimensions material properties and boundary conditions tubular members behave quite differently and deformations are governed by different patterns for example local denting dominates for short tubular members with large diameter over thickness ratios d t and global bending dominates for long tubes with small d t ratios however most tubes are likely to sustain damage due to combined local denting and overall bending braces and legs in the vicinity of a struck member will also deform and absorb energy supporting braces subjected to axial compression may buckle and dissipate energy during collisions especially when a ship strikes platform joints in view of the considerable number of aspects of the problem and their complexities ship collisions with offshore tubular structures remain a topic under intensive research and may become increasingly important as vessels grow larger the aim of this work is to review the state of the art impact response mechanics of offshore tubular structures and the design of crashworthy tubular structures the review includes nine principal sections section 2 introduces the methods for ship collision assessments and discusses material modelling and fracture section 3 presents typical ship impact loadings on offshore tubular structures section 4 reviews the global impact responses of offshore tubular structures in sections 5 and 6 the responses of single tubular members subjected to lateral impacts section 5 and axial compression section 6 are extensively discussed sections 7 and 8 deal with the responses of tubular joints and ultimate strengths of damaged tubes respectively section 9 addresses the design of crashworthy offshore tubular structures section 10 concludes the review and indicates potential topics of interest for future research 2 methods for ship collision assessments 2 1 analysis methods the analysis and design of offshore structures subjected to ship impacts requires reliable and efficient analysis tools for predicting structural damage and residual strength of damaged structures full scale experiments or model tests are considered to be the most straightforward and accurate method if the scaling law is properly handled nlfea methods have shown powerful capabilities to assess structural responses in ship collisions using coarsely meshed shell elements the commonly used general purpose nlfea packages include ls dyna hallquist 2006 abaqus hibbitt et al 2001 and msc dytran ansys usfos soreide et al 1999 which is a special purpose software based on beam column analysis is also available for efficiently and accurately predicting damage and collapse of offshore structures usfos follows the idea of the idealized structural unit method isum proposed by ueda and rashed 1984 and ueda et al 1985 in the method a structure is divided into the largest structural units possible and the geometric and material nonlinear behaviors are described in a concise analytical numerical form simplified analytical methods based on plastic analysis are often preferable in the design stage as they provide quick and reasonable predictions of structural resistance and damage and provide significant details on the underlying mechanics of structural responses in addition the resulting equations often have a simple form and are well suited to be written into design standards regarding accidental actions in order to select a proper method for ship collision analysis and design it is essential for analysts and designers to balance the required accuracy computational time and modelling efforts while considering the pros and cons of each method as follows experimental methods are useful for impact analyses of one or a few tubular members but impact experiments with entire platforms can hardly be undertaken real impacts such as the big orange ekofisk 2 4 w collision yield valuable information though simplified methods are by their very nature simple and are useful for the preliminary design and rapid assessment of structural responses but the global response of a platform is difficult to capture nlfeas employing beam column models e g usfos are capable of predicting the global response of a platform with substantially reduced computational time and resources compared to shell analysis and still with reasonably good accuracy the detailed local damage is however not provided and ship platform interactions with increasing contact area are not captured an improvement to this may be to find an empirical correction factor which is a function of dent depth and tube diameter nlfeas employing shell elements and explicit solutions methods e g ls dyna and abaqus are capable of predicting both local and global responses of struck platforms and capturing ship platform interaction effects but the required modelling effort for platforms and ships are substantial and computational time will be large significant efforts may be needed to calibrate models against code capacities for e g joints local buckling etc especially for residual strength assessments in damaged conditions 2 2 modelling material behavior and fracture steel offshore constructions are generally designed to perform an optimum between the two poles of safety and reliability on one hand and economy on the other hand fixed offshore structures are conventionally constructed from medium grade structural steels with yield strengths that are typically 355 mpa meanwhile high strength steels with yield strengths of 420 500 mpa are being increasingly applied due to their good performance with respect to increased strength to weight ratio and attendant savings in material costs and construction schedules billingham et al 2003 the steel grades are well documented in rules and standards such as dnv os b101 2009 norsok m 120 2008 bs en 10225 2009 abs modu 2012 etc even higher strength steels 550 mpa and often up to 700 mpa are also applied in mobile jack up drilling rigs billingham et al 2003 as the demand for lightweight offshore structures with high energy absorption capacities increases significantly an increasing tendency to use high strength steels can be expected particular concerns regarding the application of high strength steels are however their greater susceptibility to hydrogen cracking fatigue and fracture the mechanical behaviors of isotropic steel materials can be described by the complete stress strain curves from tensile tests as plotted in fig 4 the engineering stress strain curve includes the linear elastic stage plastic yielding a yield plateau strain hardening necking postnecking softening and fracture this should be converted to a true stress strain curve with proper corrections on postnecking softening in order to be used in nlfea the strengths of steel are likely to be influenced by the strain rates and ambient temperature as well construction steels possess substantial ductility due to strain hardening and are capable of absorbing considerable energy after the initial yielding the performance of steel ductility may be evaluated with the yield ratio σ y σ u which is defined as the initial yield stress over the ultimate stress and the elongation at fracture mild steels which have low yield ratios and large elongation percentages at fracture generally have better ductility performance than high strength steels referring to fig 4 whereas billingham et al 2003 stated that modern clean steels with low carbon contents and low levels of impurities may experience significant elongations even at high strength and high yield ratios in simplified analytical analyses steel materials are often assumed to be rigid perfectly plastic neglecting strain hardening for simplicity and this is conservative if materials with no hardening or little hardening are used in real construction the structures are however likely to develop localized deformations e g local hinges and trigger early fracture the strain rate effect in ship collisions is complicated on one hand it increases the initial yield stress and plastic flow stress of the material which is beneficial on the other hand the increased stress level is believed to reduce steel ductility and trigger a possible transition from ductile to brittle fracture however recent experiments choung et al 2013 li and chandra 1999 have shown that the elongation at fracture could either increase with higher strain rates or not have an obvious dependence this was however for tension coupon specimens that did not include cracks weld defects a widely used model for ship collision analyses was developed by cowper and symonds 1957 in which the strain rate effect was accounted for by scaling the static stress with a dynamic hardening factor dhf 1 σ d y n σ s t a t 1 ε c 1 p where ε is the strain rate and c and p are parameters that are calibrated from experiments cowper and symonds 1957 suggested c 40 4 s 1 and p 5 for the initial yield stress of mild steels based on experiments paik and thayamballi 2003 recommended c 3200 s 1 and p 5 for the initial yield of high strength steels jones 1989 stated that the c parameter should be linearly dependent on plastic strains whereas choung et al 2013 suggested to relate it to the plastic strain squared storheim and amdahl 2017 showed that calibrations based on initial yield stress would overestimate collision resistance significantly and suggested calibrating the model to the plastic flow stress nevertheless ship collisions normally occur at relatively low speeds smaller than 10 m s and the effect of strain rate on the structural response is generally limited in view of the considerable uncertainties related to strain rate effects and how to include them in a realistic manner it is recommended that the effect be disregarded in analyses of ship collisions with offshore structures another important issue is the low temperature conditions for ships and offshore structures working in arctic regions kim et al 2016 carried out material tensile tests and dropped object tests at room temperature and a low temperature of 60 c and found that the strength of steels became stronger at low temperatures and that brittle fracture may occur to conduct realistic and reliable ship collision simulations with nlfea it is essential to correctly calibrate material behavior into idealized material models the isotropic power law hardening model with a yield plateau is often used to describe steel behavior a range of input parameters need to be determined most of which have significant statistical variability and the evaluations require a high degree of craftsmanship vanderhorn and wang 2011 conducted a significant statistical study on the material properties of shipbuilding steels gained from approximately 140 000 tensile tests the data were collected from five manufacturers delivering steels for abs class ships during 2004 2009 the importance of considering the statistical uncertainties of steel material properties were indicated the probabilistic density distributions of the yield and ultimate stresses and percent elongations of different steel grades were presented hogström and ringsberg 2012 studied the influence of uncertainties of the input material parameters on the shape and size of damage to a struck ship and showed that the scattering of material properties and the choice of fracture criterion would lead to large differences in the outcome of the analysis a recent benchmark study ringsberg et al 2018 was initiated by the marstruct virtual institute for modelling buckling and fracture of structures with nlfea where 15 groups of well established researchers worldwide were invited to simulate the indentation response of a side shell structure and simulation results were compared to experiments the results showed significant scattering with respect to collision resistance and energy absorption owing to the adopted different strategies for structure modelling material calibration numerical settings and fracture criteria etc recent efforts by dnv gl with the new version dnv rp c208 2016 are dedicated to mitigating such uncertainties in assessments of nonlinear structural responses guidance or requirements are provided for many of the challenging aspects storheim et al 2017 stated that when evaluating the material strength of a body it is good practice to assess whether a high or low strength is more unfavorable for the object in question in ship collisions for example the most unfavorable combination is a high material strength of the striking vessel and a low material strength of the struck vessel typically the characteristic resistance of a body should represent a 5 probability that the resistance is less than the specified value the revised dnv rp c208 2016 opts for the characteristic resistance with a lower fractile for the struck vessel and mean values for the striking vessel which seems like a reasonable approach to obtain a combined 5 fractile storheim et al 2017 another big challenge is to accurately capture material fracture initiation and propagation with coarsely meshed shell elements the complexity lies in that fracture is a localized phenomenon on the length scale of plate thickness and is difficult to capture with large shell elements the sizes of which are several times larger than the plate thickness in addition fracture depends highly on stress states material deformation history and is sensitive to the mesh size adopted it is essential to correctly calibrate the material properties in order to accurately capture strain localizations and subsequent fracture the probabilistic nature of material properties makes fracture modelling even more complicated quite a few fracture criteria exist in the literature for structures modelled with large scale shell elements the bwh bressan williams hill criterion alsos et al 2008 and the rtcl rice tracey and cockcroft latham fracture criterion tørnqvist 2003 may be recommended as they generally show reasonable and consistent predictions in several benchmark studies calle et al 2017 ehlers et al 2008 marinatos and samuelides 2015 storheim et al 2015 with various small and large scale tests refined fracture models are needed for further studies 3 ship impact loading offshore structures may potentially suffer collisions from ships of different types including visiting vessels such as supply vessels and passing vessels e g oil tankers containerships bulk carriers submarines and passenger ships the different ship types with different displacements and structural designs yield quite different ship impact loadings on the struck structures for offshore structures struck by visiting attendant vessels the current dnv rp c204 2010 recommends a design supply vessel with a displacement of 5000 tons and the corresponding design force deformation curves for broad side bow and stern impacts are shown in fig 5 many of the curves were based on simplified analytical methods when they were derived the recently updated version of the dnv rp c204 standard dnv gl 2018 to be released has accounted for new features of increased ship displacements new ship bow designs and ice strengthened structures the recommended force deformation curves for standard design vessels with displacements of 6500 10 000 tons are shown in fig 6 the design resistance increases significantly compared to the old version curves for supply vessels with bulbous bows the force deformation relationship for bow impacts of the design vessels is given in fig 7 with both no ice reinforcements and ice 1c class force deformation curves for bow impacts of a design oil tanker 125 000 dwt and a design very large crude carrier vlcc 340 000 dwt are also recommended in the updated version of the dnv rp c204 standard dnv gl 2018 the curves presuppose that the impacted structure does not undergo substantial deformation such that the strength design requirements are complied with if this condition is not met interactions between the bow and the impacted structure shall be taken into consideration referring to haris and amdahl 2013 for a specific ship given structural details and material properties nlfea may be carried out to accurately predict the ship indentation resistance alternatively simplified methods can be used to obtain a rapid assessment of ship crushing resistance with reasonable accuracy this normally applies to ship collisions with ship sides fpsos or large diameter columns minorsky 1958 presented pioneering work that empirically related the energy absorbed in ship damage to the volume of damaged material based on full scale ship collision data the regression fit the data quite well in the high energy impact regions for conventional ships but the model can be questioned when applied to modern designed ships simplified analytical models for the crushing of plated structures notably ship bows can generally be categorized into two groups i e the intersection unit method and the plate unit method according to yamada and pedersen 2008 the intersection unit method follows the suggestion by gerard 1958 to divide complicated plated structures into basic intersecting units such as l t and x elements see fig 8 a left and b examples of the intersection unit method are amdahl 1983 yang and caldwell 1988 ohtsubo and suzuki 1994 etc the plate unit method was proposed by paik and pedersen 1995 where the structures are divided into separate plate units refer to fig 8 a right and c more details can be found in the benchmark study carried out by yamada and pedersen 2008 in which simplified methods for the axial crushing of plated structures were reviewed and predicted crushing resistances by different models were compared with a series of large scale tests on the axial crushing of bulbous bow models in addition shell plates may be subjected to stretching and develop significant membrane forces simplified models for laterally struck shell plates are found in jones et al 1970 and zhu 1990 and more recently in haris and amdahl 2012 and sun et al 2015 for ship sides 4 global response of offshore platforms 4 1 energy dissipation during a collision part of the kinetic energy will be absorbed through plastic straining structural motion and vibrations and hydrodynamic dissipation by accelerating added masses depending on the collision angle and relative position some kinetic energy may remain after the collision often ship collision assessments are carried out in two steps i e analyses of external dynamics and internal mechanics as first suggested by minorsky 1958 external dynamics deals with global motions of the striking and struck bodies before during and after collisions and predicts total energy absorption in the structures this energy should be dissipated in the internal mechanics analysis through structural deformations of the two colliding bodies regarding energy dissipation in ship ship collisions the elastic energy of ship hull girder vibrations is often considered to be negligible this was proved to be reasonable by pedersen and li 2009 and they showed that elastic energy absorbed by the struck ship through global hull girder vibrations was normally small and varied from 1 to 6 of the energy released in crushing based on the conservation of momentum pedersen and zhang 1998 proposed a closed form solution for energy dissipation in ship collisions considering planar surge sway and yaw motions stronge 2004 developed a solution for impacts of rigid bodies considering 6dof motions liu and amdahl 2010 reformulated stronge s 6dof model in a local coordinate system for ship collisions which allowed objects with three dimensional geometries and eccentricities such as icebergs to be considered the accuracy of the external dynamics models was discussed by tabri 2012 and yu et al yu and amdahl 2016 yu et al 2016a 2016b by comparison with coupled simulations the external dynamic models were found to be capable of predicting energy dissipation at the end of the first impact with good accuracy in general the prediction accuracy tended to decrease for cases with small collision angles and long durations possible secondary impacts caused by periodic motions were not captured the input normal vector of the tangential contact plane for the 6dof external dynamic model should be determined with care if the struck object is able to cover the striking ship bow ship motions may potentially be locked by structural deformations the use of the normal vectors of the undamaged structural surfaces may not give the correct predictions the coupled simulation model developed by yu et al yu and amdahl 2016 yu et al 2016a 2016b is capable of capturing hydrodynamic forces 6dof ship motions and structural damage simultaneously but virtually does not increase computational time the time for calculating hydrodynamic forces is negligible compared to that for structural response calculations fig 9 shows results from a coupled simulation of a supply vessel colliding with a vertical jacket leg 20 2 60 length m diameter m thickness mm with an impact kinetic energy of approximately 60 mj the trajectories of several representative nodes were recorded the ship rolled anticlockwise initially with large collision forces and bending moments and rolled back after some time under the action of the water restoring forces the complex 6dof ship motions and structural deformations were well captured it was observed that the external dynamic models by pedersen and zhang 1998 and liu and amdahl 2010 may fail to work for ship collisions with braces and legs because a leg would penetrate deep into the striking vessel structure and the striking ship motions would then be locked to some extent by the local deformations in such cases the assumption of rigid body collisions sharing a common tangential plane at the contact surface of the colliding bodies is no longer valid and the dissipated energy is much underestimated a similar phenomenon can be expected when a strong ship bow penetrates a weak ship side at an oblique collision angle more information on the discussion of accuracy of external dynamic models can be found in yu 2017 and yu and amdahl 2017 for offshore jackets and jack up platforms in relatively deep water the first natural periods may become comparable to typical ship impact durations and the elastic energy absorbed by platform motions needs to be accounted for this is especially the case for jack up platforms which are characterized by large natural periods and limited stiffness against lateral deflections pedersen 2013 and zhang et al 2015 proposed a simplified model for assessing the external dynamics of ship collisions considering global motions of the struck object like wind turbines quays bridges and jack up rigs see fig 10 platform motions in the transverse direction were considered the platform was found to absorb much less plastic energy compared to that assuming pure rigidity the model may be further developed to consider rotational motions in eccentric collisions nlfeas are often carried out when the global response of platform becomes important petersen and pedersen 1981 studied a ship swaying into a fixed jacket platform using a code that they developed they found that the global elastic energy of the platform was considerable when the platform had either a very large or a very small dynamic stiffness compared to the collision forces travanca and hao 2015 simulated quite a few ship collision cases with three different jacket platforms using ls dyna the platforms were modelled with shell elements they found that global elastic deflection energy could be important for jackets especially for large platforms the portions of global elastic energy out of total energy were large for ship collision with strong legs and tubular joints which have large local stiffness at the impact point travanca and hao 2014a simulated ship collisions with jacket and jack up platforms using ls dyna with shell elements and simplified the platform global response with equivalent single degree of freedom sdof systems they found that the equivalent sdof models were able to simulate global deflections of the platforms generally well however in eccentric collisions both the lateral and torsional responses were prominent for the jack up platforms equivalent models in such cases should account for both lateral and torsional responses the rotational responses were found to be less important for jackets in the studied cases in a different study by travanca and hao 2015 rotational stiffness was found important for a tripod in eccentric collisions amdahl and holmas 2016 analyzed the response of a typical jack up subjected to a high energy collision of 67 mj on a corner leg using usfos soreide et al 1999 the platform was installed at a water depth of 110 m and the first eigen period was 7 8 s it was found that the ship spent considerable time in the elastic unloading phase 1 9 5 2 s and up to 25 mj was stored as elastic energy mainly in the platform during impact the inertia force was important and the temporal impact force depended on the jack up response which could not be calculated a priori the compliance of the platform contributed significantly to the survival of the impact and needed to be considered 4 2 static and dynamic responses in ship platform collisions collisions between offshore platforms and boats are complex problems many approaches exist with varied simplifications for predicting the impact responses of vessels and platforms gjerde et al 1999 compared methods to assess the response of jack ups to boat impact and provided recommendations regarding their levels of accuracy simplified equations were found to be reasonable when structural failure was governed by failure of the impacted member or connected adjacent members that were incorporated in hand calculations for cases where structural failure was not governed by failure of the impacted member the energy absorption capabilities of the platform were underestimated by the simplified methods more accurate predictions were obtained through static and dynamic nlfeas of the entire platform the dynamic effects in ship platform collisions may be classified into two parts the local effect and the global effect the local dynamic effect is characterized by the strain rate sensitivity of the material and the inertia effect of the impacted and adjacent members the influence of the local dynamic effect is found to be generally limited in the normal range of ship impact velocities based on drop hammer test results jones et al 1992 on clamped end tubular members with varied impact velocities up to 14 m s jones and shen 1992 concluded that the quasi static approach yielded errors generally smaller than 10 percent when the striking mass was at least approximately four times larger than the beam mass provided a different failure mechanism was not activated more recently zhang et al 2018 conducted similar tests and found that dynamic hardening amplification was generally below 10 percent up to 10 m s a further increase in impact velocity to 13 m s however yielded a much larger dynamic hardening increase of around 20 percent the global dynamic effect activates the global motions of the platform structure which is especially important for jack ups during collisions the platform deck must be accelerated and there is a large force going up to the deck there is a response lag of the deck compared to the hit region due to the large inertia of the deck and the force may be calculated assuming support at the deck in a static approach the force is smaller because of deck displacement fig 11 shows the dynamic response of a jack up platform subjected to ship side collisions at the time instants of the maximum collision force and the maximum displacement the analysis was carried out by amdahl and eberg 1993 using usfos the displacements were magnified by a factor of 20 it was easily observed that the platform deck was virtually unmoved when the maximum collision force was reached in the usfos dynamic analysis the resistance to penetration of the ship bow was modelled with a nonlinear spring fig 12 a shows a force end shortening curve for the spring that was reproduced in the simulation as input and the resulting collision force history is shown in fig 12 b it is observed that the ship spent considerable time in the elastic unloading phase and that the platform received a significant impulse during this phase the impulse depended significantly on the unloading stiffness adopted which should be realistically estimated amdahl and eberg 1993 also found that three factors could be crucial to the dynamic effects the local strength of the platform relative to the ship the duration of the collision relative to the fundamental period of the governing motion and the strength of the members transmitting forces needed to accelerate the deck dynamic effects are more important for hard impacts on legs or joints than impacts on braces this is because brace impacts are soft and the forces are not sufficient to move the platform substantially whereas legs or tubular joints have greater strengths this was confirmed in azadi 2007 who simulated a ship collision with an 8 leg jacket in the north sea using usfos he also found that the dynamic effects were more significant in broad side collisions than in bow and stern collisions levanger et al 2016 emphasized the dynamic effects in high energy impacts 40 mj when carrying out quasi static and dynamic analyses of a ship jack up collision using usfos and abaqus multiple impacts between a vessel and jack ups are possible which increase plastic energy absorption and damage levels ellinas 1995 notaro et al 2015 carried out a nonlinear dynamic analysis of high energy ship jacket collisions with two methods i e a beam column analysis using usfos and the nlfea method using abaqus with shell elements in the impact region and beam elements for the global structure the two methods obtained reasonable agreement in general but significant differences may occur for scenarios where local denting or large changes in the contact surface occur this is because usfos does not capture the ship platform interaction effect with increasing contact surface area analysts may consider extracting force penetration curves from the ship impacts on deformable tubular members rather than rigid tubular members as the inputs to usofs when the ship and platform strengths fall within the shared energy range 4 3 platform pile soil interaction in most cases it has been observed that the base shears and overturning moments caused by the collision forces are significantly smaller than those created by extreme waves such that soil failure can normally be disregarded in collisions the soil will generally contribute little to energy dissipation and as a first step it may be useful to model jacket legs as being clamped at the mudline this simplifies the calculations and is conservative le sourne et al 2015 carried out a numerical analysis of an offshore wind turbine jacket impacted by a supply vessel the soil stiffness was modelled with rotational and translational springs the results showed that the soil effect had little influence on leg responses however the soil effect has often been considered to be important in barge bridge pier collisions consolazio et al 2003 and bridges under earthquake conditions makris and gazetas 1992 it is useful to check the capacity of piles in tension compression and lateral deformation but it should first be pointed out that neglecting the soil effect is conservative when considering platform safety soil stiffness in ship collisions if considered is often modelled with springs for example jin et al 2005 simplified the effects of soil reactions into three kinds of non linear springs namely a lateral spring representing the lateral bearing capacity of the soil a vertical spring representing the vertical friction force on the pile surface and a torsion spring representing the circumferential friction force on the pile surface azadi 1998 developed a simplified equivalent model for the pile soil system which was modelled as a stack of multiple disks the idea of a finite disk or strip idealization of the soil medium around a pile was originally introduced by several authors including nogami and konagai 1986 nordal et al 1985 etc the disks are connected to each other via pile beam elements the nonlinear spring and disk representation has been implemented in the usfos program the piles and springs can be modelled automatically for each layer based on the api rp2a wsd api rp2a wsd 2014 rules example pile soil models are shown in fig 13 5 response of tubular members subjected to lateral impacts considerable energy will be dissipated through plastic straining of the ship and platform during a collision often braces legs in direct contact with the ship will deform significantly and absorb a large portion of the total energy the lateral impact response of a single tubular member involves three deformation patterns of local denting global bending and membrane deformation the response behavior can be influenced by many factors such as axial loading boundary conditions impact locations initial inclination angles of tubes etc 5 1 local indentation resistance of tubular members and ring stiffened columns 5 1 1 local indentation resistance of tubular braces and legs many researchers have studied the indentation resistance of tubular members subjected to lateral impacts based on experimental observations they have proposed different idealized models for the deformed tubular cross sections a few examples are shown in fig 14 including 1 in fig 14 a the dented part is flat and the remaining part is undamaged the model in fig 14 a is simple to use and has been employed by many researchers such as furnes and amdahl 1980 1980 ellinas and walker 1983 and allan 1992 2 in fig 14 b the dented cross section consists of a flat part and arcs with different diameters in the remaining part the model in fig 14 b was proposed by wierzbicki and suh 1988 and was also used in buldgen et al 2014 3 fig 14 c and d describe the behaviors of deformed tubular cross sections that include local indentation and combined local denting and global bending the denting model in fig 14 c consists of a flat part and an arc with the diameter different from the original the model in fig 14 c and d was proposed by jones and shen 1992 fig 14 d was often used to separate local and global deformations while post processing experimental and numerical data such as in cerik et al 2016 travanca and hao 2014b more recently zhu et al 2017 carried out an experimental study of the dynamic response of fully clamped pipes subjected to dropped hammer impacts they described the cross section of the damaged tube along the tube length with a three segment mode changing from circular to oval and finally the dented region the cross section in the dented region was also described using the model in jones and shen 1992 different formulas for the denting resistance of tubes have been proposed in the literature the forms of which may vary from empirical to semi empirical and closed form solutions if no extra information is given on the shape of the indenter the indenter should be considered to be wedge shaped for a line contact b 0 and rectangular shaped for a nonzero contact width b furnes and amdahl 1980 defined the following relationship between the indenting force r and the depth of penetration w d 2 r 15 1 4 σ y t 2 d t 2 w d d where σ y is the material yield stress d is the tube dimeter and t is the wall thickness the model is also adopted in the api rp 2a wsd api rp2a wsd 2014 rules amdahl 1980 proposed a local denting model based on a plastic yield line analysis relating the denting resistance to local indentation the contact width effect was included by fitting with experimental data this model uses a flat indenter to represent the ship end or side and the tube is dented with a flattened top section the model is adopted in norsok n 004 and the denting resistance takes the following form 3 r r c 22 1 2 b d w d d 1 925 3 5 b d 4 3 1 1 4 1 n n p 3 where b is the contact width of the indenter the last term was borrowed from wierzbicki and suh 1988 to account for the effect of axial functional loads in the leg r c is a characteristic resistance of the tube and is defined as 4 r c σ y t 2 4 d t ellinas and walker 1983 investigated both local denting and global bending deformation of tubular members the expression for denting resistance of tubes is empirical 5 r k 1 4 σ y t 2 w d d 1 2 k is a constant coefficient representing the shape of the indenter and is normally assumed to be 150 according to experimental observations for concentrated loads wierzbicki and suh 1988 made the first attempt to derive a closed form solution for the indentation resistance of tubes under combined loading in the form of lateral indentation bending moment and axial force the problem was decoupled into the bending and stretching of a series of unconnected rings and generators the deformed tube sectional shape in fig 14 b was used the indentation resistance reads 6 r 16 2 π 3 d t w d d 1 4 σ y t 2 1 1 4 1 n n p 3 a big advantage of this expression is that it is theoretically derived but still preserves a simple form according to the formula of wierzbicki and suh 1988 a tube s ability to resist local denting depends on tube thickness and material yield stress but is not related to tube diameter yu and amdahl 2018 followed the derivation of wierzbicki and suh 1988 and extended the model to account for distributed loads with a contact width of b the following equation was obtained 7 r 16 2 π 3 d t w d d 1 1 4 1 n n p 3 b d 1 4 σ y t 2 in a nondimensional format it reads 8 r r c 16 2 π 3 w d d 1 1 4 1 n n p 3 b d t d cho cho 1987 1990 proposed an empirical equation for denting resistance considering contact width 9 r m 0 2 0 d t 0 2 e σ y 0 5 w d d 0 45 exp 0 1 b d w d d 0 3 where m 0 1 4 σ y t 2 buldgen et al 2014 and jones and shen 1992 presented analytical solutions for the complete behaviors of tubular members including local denting global bending and membrane stretching for local denting buldgen et al 2014 extended the model of wierzbicki and suh 1988 to consider different struck tube orientations and positions and the shape of the striking ship stem the denting model of jones and shen 1992 requires numerical iterations the expressions are complicated and are omitted here the above equations for the indentation resistance of tubes have all been verified to some extent by comparison with experimental results or numerical simulations when they were proposed the norsok model in eq 3 is widely used because it covers the contact width effect reasonable accuracy was found in general by amdahl et al 2012 travanca and hao 2014b and watan 2011 etc yu and amdahl 2018 carried out extensive numerical simulations for rigid indenters and deformable ship sterns crushing into tubular members of various dimensions and verified the denting models against simulation results they found that the denting models which considered only concentrated loads predicted the resistance quite accurately detailed comparisons were made especially for the norsok model in eq 3 the cho model in eq 9 and the modified wierzbicki and suh model in eq 8 considering the contact width effect in fig 15 results showed that the norsok model and the cho model tended to underestimate resistance for cases with large contact widths and the underestimation increased with increasing tube wall thickness for the norsok model the modified wierzbicki and suh model showed good prediction accuracy for both small and large contact widths more recently zhang et al 2018 carried out a series of drop hammer impact tests on clamped end tubular members three different impact indenter shapes were used namely wedge shaped hemispherical and cylindrical indenters the experiments showed different local deformations in the dented region with different indenters unfortunately a comparison of resistance curves and energy absorption capacities for different indenter shapes was not provided based on the experimental data the authors fitted an equation for the denting resistance of tubular members with increasing indentation depths the fitted equation is however not recommended because the indentation resistance in the equation is linearly proportional to indentation depth and also depends on tube length which contradicts most previous research and experimental observations the shape of damage in the dented zone was theoretically studied by wierzbicki and suh 1988 and an expression for the deflection of the leading generator at any location x was obtained 10 w w d 1 x ξ 2 where the transverse extension of damage along the tube length ξ is 11 ξ π d 2 w d 6 t the obtained shape of the lateral deflection of the leading generator and the shape of the dent correlated well with the experiments by smith 1982 referring to fig 16 5 1 2 local indentation resistance of ring stiffened columns ring stiffened columns have large diameter over thickness ratios and therefore deformation is mainly governed by local indentation design equations for ring stiffened columns subjected to collisions have not been officially given in the commonly used design standards an indication of strength design of large diameter columns against ship impacts is given in the commentary part of dnv rp c204 standard dnv gl 2018 where the design collision force intensity follows a pressure area relationship similar to that used for ice loads and the details can be found in hong et al 2009 and storheim and amdahl 2014 for ductile and shared energy designs more investigations are required ring stiffened columns are often subjected to local buckling of the shell wall between the rings and in plane buckling of the rings under external pressure design equations to preclude local buckling of ring stiffened columns are given in the api rp2a wsd api rp2a wsd 2014 rules experimental studies on the behavior of ring stiffened cylinders subjected to lateral indentation were carried out in refs cerik et al 2015 harding and onoufriou 1995 karroum et al 2007a b walker et al 1987 1988 a few analytical models have been proposed to predict the resistance to structural indentations for ring stiffened columns the ring stiffeners are typically treated in two ways 1 as discrete stiffeners 2 by smearing the stiffener thickness into the attached plate ronalds and dowling 1987 undertook a plastic analysis of an orthogonally stiffened cylindrical shell with lateral line loading at the mid span in the analysis the shell was assumed to act as a series of rings and longitudinal beams the results compared reasonably with their model tests the formulation however yields complicated expressions for design and may also require further validations fatt and wierzbicki 1991 proposed a procedure to calculate indentation resistance of ring stiffened columns the unstiffened tube was based on the wierzbicki and suh 1988 model the effect of strengthening stiffeners was accounted for using a discrete approach and the smeared method cerik et al 2015 modified the membrane term of the smeared model by fatt and wierzbicki 1991 to account for the boundaries of their tests free to rotate and axially deformable at both ends of ring stiffened columns the modified formulation predicted the resistance of their results quite well but overestimated the resistance for densely stiffened cylinders when compared with experiments by harding and onoufriou 1995 note that the ring stiffened column models in most of the experiments had short lengths hence after some time the longitudinal deformation pattern and resistance were influenced by displacements of the boundaries in reality ring stiffened columns are quite long and the propagation of deformations along a column s length is little influenced by the column s boundaries the diameters of ring stiffened columns are generally large in cases of beam and stern end collisions the assumption of a wide indenter adopted in previous experimental and theoretical studies should be valid refer to fig 17 b for ship bow bulb and stern end impacts however the deformations of columns may be concentrated in local regions refer to fig 17 a and the developed analysis models will be optimistic regarding column resistance 5 2 residual bending capacity of dented tubes a tube with clamped end supports will deform into a three hinge mechanism when the impact loads exceed the plastic bending collapse load the maximum lateral load r 0 can be obtained using the classical plasticity theory and is r 0 8 m p l m p is the plastic moment capacity of the tube cross section and is m p σ y d 2 t for an undamaged thin walled member however the maximum bending capacity often cannot be reached at the cross sections of the ends and the contact region at the supports the rear side of the cross section experiences significant compression and may induce local buckling whereas the front side is subjected to large stretching and may cause fracture this has been observed in experiments amdahl 1980 1983 as shown in fig 18 in addition the shear effect will become important for short beams and will reduce the maximum bending capacity of the cross section at the beam ends see jones 2011 in the contact region local indentation of the tube cross section brings about a reduction in the section modulus and produces an eccentricity about the neutral axis over the damaged region the combined effect induces a significant loss in load carrying capacity considering the deterioration effects at the supports and the contact region the effective maximum lateral load that a dented tube with clamped supports can carry is then expressed by 12 r 0 e f f 4 m p l γ 1 γ 2 where γ 1 and γ 2 are the effective bending capacity coefficients of the tube cross sections at the supports and the dented region respectively as suggested in foss and edvardsen 1982 γ 2 m r e s m p and m res is the residual bending capacity of a dented cross section a few models are available from the literature for the bending moment reduction of a dented cross section the norsok n004 standard norsok 2004 conservatively assumes that the flat part of a dented cross section is non effective which yields 13 m r e s m p cos θ 2 1 2 sin θ θ arccos 1 2 w d d taby 1986 presented a model for the ultimate strengths of dented tubular members subjected to axial compression and bending it was first assumed that a certain initial longitudinal compressive stress σpd is needed to obtain initial plastification of the damaged part of the tube s cross section once σpd has been exceeded in the damaged fibers they become ineffective and any additional bending is carried by the remaining effective section the model was implemented in a program named denta and was later adopted in usfos ellinas and walker 1983 presented an expression for the residual bending capacity of dented tubes which partly adopted taby 1986 s assumption the resulting expression yields 14 m r e s m p cos β β β w d d 1 σ d p σ y σ d p σ y d t 16 9 w d d 2 t d 2 4 3 w d d cho et al 2010 proposed an empirical equation by a regression analysis of results from a series of bending tests with dented tubes at a relatively small scale 15 m r e s m p exp 0 04 w d d 0 7 d t b d 0 1 buldgen et al 2014 formulated a moment reduction equation considering the relative positions of the striking ship and the dented tube cross section considering a simple right angle ship collision on a horizontal tube the expression becomes 16 m r e s m p 1 2 w d d 2 1 w d d 2 jones and shen 1992 proposed an equation for the development of bending moment with increasing local indentation as 17 w d d 1 2 π cos ϕ cos ϕ sin ϕ 2 2 ϕ sin ϕ m r e s m p π 2 2 ϕ sin ϕ 2 f ϕ f ϕ 2 sin ϕ sin ϕ 2 sin ϕ 1 cos ϕ the above models for bending moment reduction due to local denting are compared in fig 19 the d t ratio of the tube was set to 30 for the models by taby 1986 ellinas and walker 1983 and cho et al 2010 which are d t dependent considerable differences appear to exist for different models the models by norsok standard norsok 2004 and ellinas and walker 1983 predict small values the norsok model is conservative because there is no contribution from the dented part the expression by cho et al 2010 represents pretty well the mean strength obtained in tests the coefficient of variation for all dent ranges based on tests of their own and tests by ueda and rashed 1985 and paik and shin 1989 was estimated to be 8 for design purposes it is suggested to use a characteristic strength corresponding to the 5 quantile this yields approximately 84 of the values plotted in fig 19 but the values should be larger for small dents taby 1986 checked the bending resistance indirectly through axial compression tests he obtained excellent agreement with the tests and as such demonstrated the validity of the denting model the residual strength curves by cho and taby confirm each other in the sense that they exhibit the same trends thus for design purposes the use of the taby usfos curve seems reasonable the residual capacities predicted by buldgen et al 2014 and jones and shen 1992 have a different trend and seem to be too optimistic for the dent range of interest the situation is somewhat similar to dented offshore pipelines a review of the residual ultimate strength of offshore pipelines with structural damage can be found in cai et al 2017 5 3 transition from local denting to global bending a brace leg deforms first by local denting in the contact region and the increasing local indentation continuously decreases the plastic bending collapse load there exists a transition indentation ratio wd tran d beyond which the tube will initiate global bending upon further deformation the beam plastic resistance may remain constant or increase depending on the tube boundary conditions see fig 20 a and b for very thin walled tubes the resistance decreases further as denting continues in the beam bending stage de oliveira et al 1982 derived the analytical expression for the transition ratio from local denting to global bending as 18 w d t r a n d 2 k k 2 1 where 19 k 1 π 4 l d 2 d t ellinas and walker 1983 gave a more complicated expression for the transition indentation by solving the following equations 20 w d t r a n d 16 k d l d t 1 cos β β 2 where 21 β 1 d t 16 9 w d t r a n d 2 t d 2 4 3 w d t r a n d w d t r a n d yu and amdahl 2018 proposed an expression for the transition indentation ratio considering the effect of distributed loads over a contact length of b the transition indentation ratio is obtained by solving 22 r 0 2 r c 1 1 w d t r a n d w d t r a n d w d t r a n d 2 22 1 2 b d w d t r a n d 1 925 3 5 b d where 23 r 0 r c 32 d t d l b yu and amdahl 2018 found that the rear side of the struck tube would contract during local denting due to ovalization of tube cross sections see fig 14 c and the nodal velocity at the rear side would thus not continuously increase this made it easier to separate the denting and bending stages they verified the analytical expressions for the transition ratio using numerical results and good agreement was obtained in general for the three models the transition indentation ratio wd tran d depends on r 0 r c according to the models by de oliveira et al 1982 and yu and amdahl 2018 r 0 r c varies with powers of 3 2 1 2 and 1 for the diameter thickness and length of a brace leg respectively another important factor is the contact width b on one hand it reduces the effective length when calculating r 0 and therefore yields a larger r 0 r c and subsequently a larger wd tran d on the other hand the capability to resist local denting is enhanced with increasing contact width which reduces the wd tran d the decreasing tendency seems to be dominant with increasing contact widths fig 21 shows the variations in transition indentation ratios over wide ranges of l d and d t by using de oliveira et al 1982 s model l d was varied from 5 to 60 and d t from 10 to 80 it was found that the large transition indentation ratios concentrated in the region with small l d and large d t values according to the numerical simulation results in yu and amdahl 2018 there exists a threshold value of the wd tran d below which almost no local denting occurs before bending a threshold value of 0 15 was recommended by yu and amdahl 2018 the concept of transition ratio aids in understanding the dominant deformation patterns local denting bending or combined denting and bending given certain tube dimensions global bending commences once the transition indentation is reached but this does not mean local denting will cease immediately fig 22 shows the nodal displacements on the front and rear sides of a tube from which local denting may still increase after initiation of global deflections it is therefore not a good criterion to keep a tube cross section compact by limiting the transition ratio to a small value 5 4 bending and membrane stretching of tubes tubes will start global bending and deflect laterally when the transition indentation is reached for tubes with clamped boundaries membrane force increases with increasing lateral deflections and later becomes dominant up to fracture if the adjacent members and joints have sufficient strengths against being pulled in based on a rigid plastic analysis guedes soares and søreide 1983 presented an analytical model for the resistance of laterally loaded tubular members local indentation is assumed to be small and negligible the interaction effect of bending moment and axial force is considered for a perfect tubular cross section the interaction function yields 24 m m p cos π 2 n n p 0 where mp is the plastic bending moment of the cross section and np is the plastic yielding force of the cross section in tension the following expression for the resistance deflection relationship is obtained 25 r r 0 1 w b d 2 w b d arcsin w b d w b d 1 π 2 w b d w b d 1 where w b is the lateral deflection of the beam this model shows very good agreement for minor denting cases but the difference becomes large with increasing local indentations de oliveria 1981 presented a beam deformation model for tubes considering the axial and rotational flexibilities at the supports the interaction between bending moment and axial membrane forces was accounted for and local indentation was neglected the results showed that the axial stiffness at the supports was very important for the development of membrane forces in the tubes especially for cases with large lateral transverse displacements the influence of finite axial stiffness is also included analytically in the updated dnv rp c204 standard dnv gl 2018 where the expressions slightly simplified for the lateral deflection resistance of tubular members with finite axial stiffness and fixed rotations at the supports yield 26 r r 0 1 n n p π 2 π 2 n n p w b d n n p 1 π 2 w b d n n p 1 where the development of axial forces with lateral deflections is 27 n n p w b d 1 c 1 e c w b d n n p 1 c is the non dimensional spring stiffness the effect of rotational stiffness should be small in practice and is limited by plastic bending moment the bending moment tends to become insignificant at large deformations when the membrane force dominates the above expressions are based on perfect tubular cross sections neglecting local denting it should be noted that for braces supported by strong tubular joints and adjacent structures the effect of local indentation becomes negligible when axial membrane force dominates and the resistance will finally converge to the solution with perfect cross sections in pure tension for legs local indentation can be substantial whereas the development of axial membrane forces compared to the yield axial force is limited it may be useful to assume constant forces in the beam bending stage see fig 21 a a few researchers have proposed analytical solutions for the lateral deflection resistance of tubular members considering a dented cross section such as ellinas and walker 1983 jones and shen 1992 buldgen et al 2014 etc ellinas and walker 1983 assumed that local denting ceased immediately when the tube started global bending the ultimate lateral load was reached when the tube started global bending and the force was kept constant afterwards by neglecting the development of membrane forces jones and shen 1992 considered three deformation stages of local denting global bending and membrane stretching and allowed local denting deformations to continue in the global deformation phase the resulting expressions are however complicated for design purposes generally good agreement was obtained with the maximum permanent transverse displacements from experimental tests in jones et al 1992 in which results from a series of static and dynamic impacts for tubes with various dimensions were reported they found that regardless of whether bending or local denting governed the tube deformation the dimensionless dissipated strain energy changed almost linearly with the maximum permanent transverse displacement similar findings were reported by travanca and hao 2014b through extensive numerical simulations buldgen et al 2014 presented an analytical solution considering the complete behaviors including local denting global bending and membrane stretching the different orientations and positions of the struck tube and the shape of the striking ship stem were accounted for the proposed method was verified to be of reasonable accuracy using finite element software ls dyna it is not clear whether it is important to consider tube orientation and stem shape but accounting for the two factors makes the expressions rather complicated le sourne et al 2015 carried out a numerical analysis of an offshore wind turbine jacket impacted by a supply vessel and found that for the leg impact case the impacted leg dissipated approximately 60 of the total internal energy some plastic strains also developed in the legs extremities and the rear leg could be punched by the connected braces it is therefore not a good approximation to assume that all the energy is dissipated through deformations of the impacted leg based on the observations le sourne et al 2016 derived analytical expressions for energy absorption in two additional scenarios other than that wherein the impacted leg was laterally deformed the first considered a leg punched by one or several compressed braces and the second considered the buckling of a rear compressed leg near the mudline during the overall deformation of the jacket based on the concept of the super element method they proposed an efficient method that included simplified solutions for local denting global bending axial stretching brace punching and buckling the proposed method was verified to be of reasonable accuracy with a few cases using ls dyna for the same wind turbine jacket from which they obtained the idealized displacement fields the transferability to other platforms needs further investigations another concern with respect to the work is that application of simplified methods to regions far away from the impacted location may not be safe for structural design because many uncertainties are not captured by the idealized model such as fracture and failure and force redistribution throughout the entire structure after member failure tubular pipes containing liquid gas or granular materials that are often pressurised have similar structural performances when subjected to lateral impacts the material contents in pipes will provide inertia resistance to deformation through the added mass effect and the effect increases with increasing density of the contents jones and birch 2010 showed that increasing internal pressure caused a small reduction in the maximum permanent transverse displacement but caused an important reduction in impact energy for failure more research on the lateral impacts of matter filled pipes can be found in refs jones and birch 1996 ma and stronge 1985 nishida and tanaka 2006 palmer et al 2006 5 5 influence of axial pre compression and boundary conditions tubular members especially platform legs are often preloaded to some extent by carrying the weight of the platform and additional environmental loads the effect of axial pre compression is two fold i the axial force will reduce the plastic bending moment of the cross section and the denting resistance ii during finite lateral deformation it will create additional bending moments it is noticed that in many cases the axial stress is small compared to the yield strength such that the first effect is small furthermore many platforms possess significant redistribution capabilities so that the axial force in a leg is reduced when the leg deforms this can be well illustrated by fig 23 in which an offshore jacket was impacted by a vessel on the leg both static and dynamic analyses were carried out using usfos the static analysis in fig 23 a shows that a buckled brace fairly distant from the contact region can cause force redistribution throughout the entire platform and can be important in resisting collision loads the dynamic analysis results from fig 23 b by skallerud and amdahl 2002 showed that the plastic deformation of the leg caused the axial force in the leg to unload its share of the topside weight in the extreme it became tensile by simple equilibrium the opposite leg had to unload the net result was that the two central legs had to carry the entire weight of the platform most investigators have studied the behaviors of tubular members with constant preloads thus implicitly assuming a non redundant structure wierzbicki and suh 1988 presented a closed form solution for the indentation resistance of tubes under combined axial forces and bending moment as shown in eq 6 the last term represents the degradation effect of the load carrying capacity of preloaded tubes the theory predicted a threshold force ratio of n np 0 5874 np is the ultimate strength of the tube in tension below which no lateral forces can be equilibrated by the system norsok n004 norsok 2004 considered the strength reduction due to axial compression loading by introducing an effective factor k 28 k 1 0 n s d n r d 0 2 1 0 2 n s d n r d 0 2 0 2 n s d n r d 0 6 0 n s d n r d 0 6 where nsd and nrd are the design axial compressive force and resistance respectively in order for the above equations to be valid no local buckling of the tube cross section shall occur local buckling of unstiffened tubular cross sections can be checked according to the api rule api rp2a wsd 2014 and dnv gl rp c204 dnv gl 2018 standard both rules indicate significant dependence on the diameter over thickness ratio d t the api rule api rp2a wsd 2014 requires that unstiffened cylindrical members with d t greater than 60 should be investigated for elastic and inelastic local buckling of cross sections under axial compression by means of finite element analyses khedmati and nazari 2012 preloaded tubes to force levels of 0 100 of the yield strength and found that the compressive loads significantly degraded the ultimate strength and energy absorption capabilities of the tubes the ultimate strength of tubular members was found to increase when the impact position moved from the middle towards the end however the tubes tend to fracture early and absorb less energy as shown in the experiments by jones et al 1992 the effect of preloading was also studied experimentally and numerically in zeinoddini et al zeinoddini et al 1998 2002 2008 2008 zeinoddini et al 2002 numerical and experimental results from khedmati and nazari 2012 and zeinoddini et al zeinoddini et al 1998 1999 2008 2002 indicated that contrary to the theory predicted by wierzbicki and suh 1988 a member with an axial compressive preloading exceeding 0 5874np could still resist some lateral load the reason may be that the equation proposed by wierzbicki and suh 1988 was obtained by assuming no global rotation in the member which is questionable for the real behavior of a tube zeinoddini et al 1998 the effects of three different boundaries conditions at the supports were investigated by numerical simulation in khedmati and nazari 2012 and zeinoddini et al 1998 the considered boundary conditions were type 1 with free axial sliding and rotation type 2 with free sliding and fixed rotation and type 3 with fixed sliding and rotation typical resistance displacement curves are shown in fig 24 the resistances of tubes under type 1 and 2 conditions have clear maximum values and the governing deformation modes are local denting and beam bending for type 3 the resistance increases continuously with lateral deflections due to significant membrane forces however none of the above three types of boundary conditions provide a good representation of the boundaries of braces and legs in real platforms a more realistic representation of the boundary conditions may be to assume finite axial and rotational stiffnesses at the supports the axial stiffness governs the development of membrane forces and influences the total resistance significantly qvale 2012 and watan 2011 considered the axial stiffness of jacket legs when analyzing supply vessel side and stern collisions with jacket platforms they removed the struck leg from the platform in usfos and applied axial forces at the end nodes see fig 25 a the axial stiffness was taken as the tangent of the obtained force displacement curve and then implemented in the ls dyna model as the spring stiffness see fig 25 b results showed that the force decreased when considering axial flexibilities compared to that under clamped end conditions the reduction was especially significant for weak columns because they experienced large deformations rotational springs are needed for better representation of the boundaries a more accurate way to represent the boundary conditions of a member may be to properly model the tubular joints and adjacent tubular members 6 responses of tubular members subjected to axial compression supporting braces can be loaded axially during collisions especially when a ship collides onto a platform tubular joint e g wang et al 2016 responses of circular tubes under compression have been investigated by many researchers especially as energy absorbers in the automobile industry a few review articles on thin walled structures as energy absorbers can be found in refs abramowicz 2003 alghamdi 2001 olabi et al 2007 a series of experiments was carried out on steel and aluminum tubes of different dimensions that were loaded quasi statically and dynamically such as guillow et al 2001 karagiozova and jones 2008 andrews et al 1983 and abramowicz and jones 1997 depending on tube dimensions boundary conditions and impact velocities circular tubes behave quite differently fig 26 shows three main deformation patterns from experiments the axisymmetric mode also known as concertina mode the asymmetric mode also called diamond mode and the global bending mode due to euler buckling some tubes may exhibit combined deformation modes andrews et al 1983 summarized the experimental results and presented a classification chart of the deformation modes of quasi statically compressed aluminum alloy tubes see fig 27 similar charts can also be found in guillow et al 2001 the experiments showed that the initial buckling phase is decisive in forming the energy absorption mechanisms a static critical tube length l c r s t a t i c exists for a particular diameter over thickness ratio d t such that tubes shorter than that length collapse progressively whereas longer tubes develop a global bending mode in general tubes used in offshore jacket and jack up platforms have large length over diameter ratios l d and deform mainly in the global bending mode abramowicz and jones 1997 and karagiozova and alves 2004 showed that the critical length for buckling transition increased when the tubes were loaded dynamically this was attributed to the increased lateral inertia of the shell however in ship platform collisions impact velocities are generally low and the dynamic effects are secondary foss and edvardsen 1982 compared the energy absorption capabilities of offshore tubular members subjected to lateral impacts and axial compression considering different boundary conditions the test results showed that a compression member absorbed energy similar to that for a bending member and may be treated as a bending member for energy absorption purposes large diameter thin walled cylinders are also commonly used as compression elements in offshore installations such as semi submersibles spars and more recently as buoyancy columns for floating offshore wind turbine foundations they are often stiffened with ring stiffeners and or stringers for such members progressive buckling modes may develop analytical solutions for the average collapse load of the axisymmetric and asymmetric models in fig 26 have been provided by alexander 1960 and johnson et al 1977 respectively amdahl and søreide 1981 studied the axial crushing of a cylindrical bulbous bow stiffened with transverse frames longitudinal stringers and a centerline bulkhead the method proposed by gerard 1958 that cuts cross sections into simple elements was found to agree well with experimental curves further discussion is omitted 7 behavior of tubular joints the integrity of tubular joints is crucial to ensure the smooth transfer of the collision forces from the impact location to the adjacent structures in the initial stages the hit brace or leg deforms by bending whereas braces may develop significant axial tension forces during finite deformations in addition legs may sometimes be capable of completely unloading the axial compressions induced by the functional loads and develop some tension but the tension forces will be small compared to the yield forces the ultimate load carrying capacities of tubular joints determine to a large extent the amounts of energy absorbed by bracing members failure of tubular joints may be caused by buckling of the chord excessive deformations or the initiation and propagation of cracks the capacities of tubular joints are typically expressed in code requirements for offshore structures e g iso 19902 iso 2007 api rp 2a wsd api rp2a wsd 2014 and norsok n004 norsok 2004 three characteristic actions are often considered compression or tension in plane bending ipb and out of plane bending opb normally opb predominates for impact actions combined axial force ipb and opb are considered through interaction formulas the effect of axial force in the chord i e the leg is also taken into account it is distinguished by three different joint categories x k and t joints the classification depends on the load transfer the behavior of x k and t joints up to peak capacity is given as a nonlinear force displacement moment rotation curve according to the formulations developed in joint industry projects carried out by msl engineering ltd msl engineering ltd 1996 2000 considering also the tension ductility limits the actual behavior of tubular joints may be a combination of the three load categories and the contribution from each category may vary during the impact hence the joint may need to be constantly reclassified during the collision action this approach is adopted in usfos it is noted that joint classification and resistance are based on the plane of action neglecting the effect of out of plane braces the approach is considered to be conservative for multi planar joints this circumstance and the fact that capacity formulas are based on characteristic resistances make it likely that the use of shell element modelling of joints in a nonlinear finite element analysis of a ship impact will yield larger joint capacities than those given in the design codes a collision analysis based on shell finite element modelling of a joint and braces framing into the joint of a jacket was carried by notaro et al 2015 using abaqus explicit the colliding object was assumed to be the pontoon bow of a semi submersible platform the pontoon bow was also modelled with shell finite elements which allowed a significantly better simulation of the contact area and dent growth the investigation confirmed a somewhat higher resistance of the t joint in the fe analysis compared to the usfos use of code formulations the multi planar effect was probably low in the present case because of the simple joint geometry and only two out of plane braces notaro et al 2015 also simulated a direct hit on a joint that induced local denting of the chord wall the simple local denting formulations used in the beam models are not intended to include chord walls in tubular joints the damage obtained in the fe analysis was smaller but in the same order of magnitude part of the difference was also attributed to more realistic development of the contact area and dent in the fe simulations 8 ultimate strength of damaged tubes depending on impact intensity and tube strength tubular members will absorb impact energy by developing deformations of the following forms 1 local denting of the tube wall without overall bending of the member 2 overall bending without denting of the tube wall 3 combined overall bending and denting deformations the damage types seem to be governed by the transition ratio as discussed in section 5 3 the damaged tubular members may be subjected to various loading conditions during platform operations which may include axial compression bending combined axial compression and bending and combined axial compression and hydrostatic pressure a series of axial compression tests of damaged tubes both at a small scale and at full scale was carried out by smith et al 1979 1980 1981 the results indicated that the small scale experiments provided satisfactory accuracy when compared to the full scale tests the ultimate strength of the slightly damaged members was significantly less than that of the undamaged ones for tubes with only overall bending damage an elastoplastic beam column analysis smith et al 1979 showed good correlation with test results for tubes with local indentations they proposed a semi empirical method based on the experiments by introducing an effective modulus and yield stress in the dented region taby et al 1981 taby and moan 1985 and yao et al 1988 proposed an analytical numerical model of a damaged tubular member subjected to axial compression based on yield line theory the theory was later adopted in usfos the tubes were loaded incrementally after initial plastification the dented region was assumed to be ineffective and an additional load increase was carried by the elastoplastic behavior of the undamaged part of the dented cross section plastic hinges were introduced when the ultimate strength was reached the incremental load deformation relationship in the post ultimate stage was formulated in the form of stiffness matrices the interaction between bending moment and axial forces was considered where the dent was in compression a series of axial compression tests on damaged tubes was carried out in 1980 and 1983 and was reported in taby and moan 1985 and taby 1986 the experimental results showed that dent depth increased significantly in the post ultimate stage and the force dropped rapidly see fig 28 an empirical function was derived to account for the growth in dent depth after calibration the model compared reasonably well with the experiments considering the general loading case the resultant bending moment of the dented cross section may have an arbitrary angle with respect to the dent this was considered in ueda and rashed 1985 they derived an ultimate strength interaction relationship of a dented tube member subjected to axial force and bending moment in two perpendicular directions a series of bending tests of dented tubes was carried out the results showed that the effect of a dent on the ultimate strength reduction was predominant when the dent was in compression the effect was less when the dent was in tension or at the neutral axis the predicted results agreed reasonably well with the experiments ellinas 1984 presented a simple method for estimating the reserved strength of damaged tubes with local denting damage overall beam deflection and combined local denting and overall deflection damage the method showed a clear lower bound when compared to previous experiments and was conservative for safety considerations a parametric study was carried out and showed that the behavior of damaged tubular members was highly influenced by the column slenderness parameter λ r the dent depth and the overall bending imperfection the ultimate strength reduction caused by initial local denting damage was potentially more important for cases with small λ r and small bending imperfections unlike the previous analytical models assuming ineffectiveness of the dented region after initial plastification durkin 1987 represented fibers inside the dents as a series of longitudinal strips with a deflection shape that was characteristic of a beam on an elastic foundation combined axial loading and bending moments were assumed the ultimate strength was reached when a point of plastic instability occurred during iterations and the stress level was maximized the predicted results of the models were compared with experiments and numerical simulations and the differences of the ultimate strength values were reported to be within 5 the behavior of dented tubular members with and without considering local buckling and residual stresses was also analyzed by duan et al 1993 1990 using an empirical analytical moment curvature approach the effect of residual stress in the dented region is often considered to be negligible in the analytical models pacheco and durkin 1988 carried out experimental and numerical studies on the behavior of dented tubular members and showed that the exclusion of the residual stress effect will lead to small underestimations of residual strength the underestimation was likely to be substantial for tubes with large dents 9 design considerations 9 1 the design philosophy a crashworthy structure against ship impacts implies a structure that is designed such that it is capable of withstanding collisions without global collapse the energy may be absorbed either by plastic straining of the structure itself or by deforming the striking ship according to dnv rp c204 2010 when designing offshore structures against accidental ship impacts significant structural deformations may be allowed provided that the damage does not lead to progressive collapse of the structures or destroy the usability of escape ways the platform after the impact should preserve sufficient load carrying capacities to resist environmental and functional loads before it is repaired it can be very challenging both numerically and physically to pursue structural behavior until total collapse of the system e g significant uncertainties exist regarding actual ductility limits for members and joints and how to model them in theoretical analyses hence it has become customary to design components and subsystems to resist characteristic ship collision actions and relevant permanent and environmental loads both during damage and in post damage conditions so that they undergo substantial damage but still have considerable margins against complete failure the design of platform braces legs against ship impacts may be carried out in the ductile shared energy or strength design domain dnv rp c204 2010 see fig 29 strength design the installation is strong enough to resist collision forces with minor deformation so that the ship is forced to deform and dissipate the major part of the energy ductility design the installation undergoes large plastic deformation and dissipates the major part of the collision energy shared energy design both the installation and the ship contribute significantly to energy dissipation the governing factor is the resistance to plastic collapse in bending r 0 if the resistance is larger than the force that the ship will produce when penetrated by a rigid tube the ship will predominantly dissipate the collision energy i e the brace leg response is in the strength domain however the brace leg must also comply with local denting compactness requirements otherwise the ship s resistance to penetration will be larger than the residual bending collapse resistance of a dented tube if r 0 is less than the ship s resistance to penetration the brace leg will be in the shared energy or ductile domain depending on the brace leg dimensions and material strength it may dissipate considerable energy by beam bending and membrane forces at large deformations local denting will contribute to the energy dissipation as well however it may be advisable to avoid significant local denting because local denting reduces total energy absorption and responses for denting beyond brace leg radius are uncertain with little denting simple equations apply as stated before unless further evaluations are performed the kinetic energy for a bow impact should be 50 mj according to the new version norsok n003 standard norsok 2017 this energy level cannot be absorbed by a single brace or leg a viable option is to design the braces to have sufficient strength to penetrate the bow so that the ship can dissipate considerable energy which falls into the shared energy or strength design domain 9 2 ship platform interaction within the shared energy domain the response and energy absorption of the striking and struck objects are very sensitive to their relative strengths and failure of a single structural component may turn the strong structure into the weak to capture the ship platform interactions accurately an integrated analysis of platform and ship structures modelled with shell elements is required proper modelling of the material properties and fracture is essential refer to section 2 2 during collisions the softer structure will deform and the impact force will be distributed over a larger contact area this increases the resistance of the strong structure and therefore there will be an upward shift of the resistance curve to the stronger structure as shown in fig 30 in designing offshore platforms the load deformation curves of ships and platforms are often established independently by disregarding the relative strength and assuming that the other object is infinitely rigid shared energy design based on such independently obtained force curves may not yield the correct energy distributions to account for the ship platform interactions the new version dnv gl rp c204 dnv gl 2018 treats it empirically by introducing an energy dissipation correction factor β such that 29 e s β 0 w s max r s d w s 0 w i max r i d w i where r s and r i are the deformation resistances of the ship and the installation respectively 0 β 1 limits the energy dissipation capability of the structure travanca and hao 2015 tried three parameters k s m 0 k s k i and r c to represent the relative strengths of a striking ship and the struck installation and plotted energy dissipation proportions versus the relative strength factors based on numerical simulation k s and k i are the tangential stiffness of the force displacement curves of the ship and installation respectively they found that the thickness of the installation tubes played an important role in determining the platform energy absorption and that plastic bending moment of tube walls per unit width m 0 1 4 σ y t 2 could therefore be used to describe the platform relative strength it is difficult to find the proportion of energy dissipation in a platform and ship using simple methods during a ship collision the weaker structure may shift several times from one to the other in shared energy design the new version dnv gl rp c204 dnv gl 2018 relates the amount of energy dissipation in a ship bow to the collapse resistance in bending for the brace r 0 as shown in table 1 provided that the compactness requirement is satisfied the results shown in the table are based on a conservative consideration of a series of numerical simulation results this share of energy dissipation has not been extended to ship stern and broad side impacts 9 3 compactness requirements against excessive local dents a few requirements exist in the literature for a brace leg to maintain compactness during deformation sherman 1976 suggested that members with d t of 35 or less and l d up to 22 can be deemed to maintain full bending capacity during deformation based on experimental observations the api rules api rp2a 1977 prescribe d t 9000 σ y σ y in mpa to maintain full capacity trough plastic deformation for 9000 σ y d t 15200 σ y a limited plastic rotation capacity can be assumed the current norsok n004 norsok 2004 and dnv gl rp c204 dnv rp c204 2010 require the following compactness criterion to avoid excessive local denting of the tube before forming a three hinge collapse mechanism 30 r 0 r c 6 this criterion was shown to be overly conservative in storheim and amdahl 2014 based on observations of numerical simulation results they proposed to use r c as a characteristic strength factor the r c criterion was proved to be useful in travanca and hao 2015 through a series of numerical simulation cerik et al 2016 carried out a series of impact experiments and numerical simulations to study the responses of tubular members subjected to mass impacts a classification of the impact responses of tubular members is suggested by using the indicator of r0 rc the following four response categories are suggested mode 1 r 0 r c 6 5 dominated by global bending mode 2 6 5 r 0 r c 10 dominated by both local denting and beam deformation and local denting ceases immediately after plastic collapse mode 3 10 r 0 r c 23 dominated by both local denting and beam deformation and local denting continues after plastic collapse model 4 r 0 r c 23 dominated by local shell denting yu and amdahl 2018 found that the d t and l d requirements and the r0 rc criterion actually limited the transition indentation to a small value refer to section 5 3 but may not restrict the development of local denting in the beam bending stage they suggested using the rc criterion following the recommendations of storheim and amdahl 2014 and related to the maximum collision force f max when a ship s bow crushes a rigid brace leg 31 r c 1 9 f max 24 the criterion in eq 31 was shown to be useful for limiting the development of local indentation in the bending stage as well as through a series of numerical simulations rc is suggested to be 1 2 mn for stern corner impacts and 1 5 mn for stern end impacts the compactness criteria require more validation 9 4 residual strength of damaged platforms platforms after ship collision damage should be able to withstand operational loads and certain environmental loads without progressive collapse of the structures the strength capacities of damaged platforms should be checked refer to fig 31 dnv rp c104 dnv 2012 and api rp2a wsd api rp2a wsd 2014 require that a damaged platform shall survive environmental loads corresponding to a return period of no less than 1 year a more strict criterion is to require the damaged platform to survive the environmental loads with an annual exceedance probability of 10 2 according to moan 2009 which corresponds to the requirement for ultimate limit state design of an intact platform however in the damaged state the partial safety factors for loads and resistance can be taken as equal to unity a simple albeit conservative approach is to remove the struck member by assuming that it is completely ineffective after damage and then to undertake a push over analysis to check the platform residual strength refer to e g amdahl and johansen 2001 for dented tubes a few formulations exist refer to e g taby 1986 and ellinas 1984 that allow taking post damage strength into account naderi et al 2009 carried out a static pushover analysis of a jacket platform under both intact and damaged conditions using usfos the platform was a four legged production jacket with k braced frames located in the persian gulf the investigated damage on tubular structures encompassed dent depths of 0 25d 0 50d and 0 75d or out of straightnesses of 0 5 0 75 1 2 and 1 4 the results showed that the damaged platform had considerable redundancy to withstand external loads through force redistributions and the failure of one component would generally not limit the capacity of the structure as a whole the reserve capacity of an intact platform can be described by the reserve resistance factor ref 32 ref environmental loads at collapse undamaged design environmental loads the residual strength of a damaged offshore platform may be represented by the residual strength factor rsf which is defined as 33 rsf environmental loads at collapse damaged design environmental loads according to naderi et al 2009 the rsfs with failure of one member for the investigated jacket ranged over 1 4 to 2 1 depending on damage type extent and location where the design loads were selected as wave loads with a return period of 100 years the rsfs for an eight legged north sea jacket can range over 3 1 4 4 according to ghose et al 1994 similar conclusions were reported by sveen 1990 when a west german submarine collided with the eight legged oseberg b jacket on the norwegian continental shelf in 1988 the estimated energy of which was 5 6 mj collapse analysis of the damaged platform revealed high reserve strengths an rsf of approximately 2 3 for the jacket structure failure of several tubular members will further reduce the residual capacity of a damaged platform and threaten its global integrity an example is the big orange ekofisk 2 4 w collision psa 2009 after which the jacket had to be dismantled billington et al 1993 reviewed reserve residual and ultimate strength analyses of offshore structures before the 1990s the methods including analytical experimental and nonlinear finite element analyses used to evaluate the reserve and residual strengths of offshore platforms were summarized in addition to the damaged members the influence of nonlinear joint behavior platform foundations and realistic load distributions were highlighted in general ship collisions take place around the mean water level hence a platform s global resistance to environmental loads is only moderately affected because a significant part of the wave loads enters below the collision zone it is also essential for the residual strength such that the platform can allow for a complete loss of load carrying by the damaged legs either by redistributing the topside loads by diagonals to the adjacent legs as is the case for the platform in fig 32 or by the topside framework note that only two legs must carry the total topside loads for the damaged jacket in fig 32 10 conclusions and recommendations this paper presents a review of the structural response and design of offshore tubular structures subjected to ship impacts from the point of view of platform crashworthiness design significant changes have taken place since the first dnv rule for ship collisions in the 1980s notably the increased impact energy due to larger vessels and impact speeds and new ship designs such as bulbous bows x bows and ice strengthened vessels this has triggered a revision to the dnv rp c204 in 2017 the standard design energy has increased significantly to 50 mj for bow impacts 28 mj for broad side collisions and 22 mj for stern collisions in the new version norsok n003 standard to absorb such large amounts of energy strength design or shared energy design may be required for which a struck brace or leg must be capable of penetrating the bow such that the ship dissipates considerable energy collision analysis is often considered to be centric i e the impact force is directed through the center of gravity of the ship and floating platforms this is often a very credible scenario but sometimes it is overly conservative because part of the impact energy may be transferred into other motion components e g sway roll yaw and pitch external dynamics methods have been developed that often provide approximate but useful results for general eccentric collisions external dynamic models should be used with care for ship collisions with offshore braces and legs because tubular members may penetrate into the striking ship bow and lock the ship motions the dissipated energy predicted by external dynamic models can be much underestimated for cases with complex ship motions long durations or potential motion locking the coupled simulation method based on beam shell modelling with beam elements representing the global motion of the ship is promising and should be further developed any secondary impacts should also be considered in eccentric collisions jackets installed in shallow and moderately deep water are generally dominated by static responses deep water jackets and notably jack ups are more compliant and may absorb a considerable part of the energy by elastic deformation ship collision assessments of such platforms should be carried out using dynamic analysis during a collision energy absorption in the platform occurs mainly through lateral deformation of the struck and adjacent members buckling of compressed members and global motions of the platform the deformations of laterally impacted unstiffened tubular members will exhibit three deformation stages local denting global bending and membrane stretching the underlying mechanics of tube deformation and the ultimate strength of damaged tubes and platforms have been reviewed it was found that existing simplified models captured the main features of the denting process and the residual capacity of dented members subjected to bending and compression such models have been implemented in the beam column element formulation in the usfos computer program cross sectional denting will significantly degrade the bending capacities of tubular members therefore in order to obtain strength design it is essential to design a brace or leg so that it does not undergo large denting the extent of the local dent before entering the global bending stage can be described by the denting transition ratio compactness requirements in the literature were reviewed and the characteristic denting resistance factor rc was adopted as a compactness indicator in the new version dnv gl rp c204 if the strengths of the platform and ship fall in the shared energy domain significant ship platform interactions will occur and local denting of the struck tube will increase the ship s resistance to penetration the ship platform interaction effect is considered in the new version dnv gl rp c204 standard by introducing a correction factor β that is related to the denting resistance rc of tubulars the procedure developed to account for the interaction effect is simplified if more accurate calculations are required it is always possible to conduct nlfea simulations with shell element modelling of the hit member and the ship using explicit programs such as ls dyna and abaqus modelling ship structures is somewhat demanding the finite element library of a few supply vessels established by dnv gl and made available to the engineering community is very valuable for this purpose and it also standardizes the vessels used by different companies this will enhance greatly the use of explicit nlfea in the future the boundary conditions adopted for collision simulations need to be considered carefully alternatively analyses may be carried out using complete platform models preferably hybrid shell beam models should be used such that beam elements are utilized outside the region of primary damage depending on the studied problem and platform configurations shell modelling of several members and joints may be needed columns subjected to compression should contain imperfections that are carefully calibrated to code column curves shell modelling of tubular joints is cumbersome but it will allow for collision simulations against tubular joints where little information exists regarding resistance to impact it is also noted that tubular joints modelled with shell elements will generally produce ultimate bending capacities larger than those predicted by usfos in which joint strength is based on code formulations because the codes neglect the strengthening effect of multi planar joints because collision forces in most cases are considerably smaller than the extreme environmental loads soil capacity will most often not be challenged in such cases analysts can be significantly eased by skipping pile soil modelling and using pinned boundary conditions at the mud line this is generally conservative nlfea may be needed if contact takes place close to brace ends because the simplified dent models that have been developed may not be representative for behaviors in such cases there is room for the improvement of simplified methods for the determination of indentation resistance of ring and or axially stiffened columns e g for semi submersibles the formulations proposed have so far considered a knife edged rigid indenter for stern corner and bow bulb impacts contact forces will be more concentrated and the formulations for knife edge indenters may overpredict the resistance precise prediction of fracture is essential with respect to damage prediction and opening of compartments to flooding or cargo spills several models have been proposed and compared with experiments but room for improvement remains significant acknowledgments this work has been funded by the research council of norway rcn through the centers of excellence funding scheme project amos

23508,maneuverability is one of the most important performance characteristics of submarines hydrodynamic model is increasingly relied on as a design approach to determine the inherent motion behavior of a proposed submarine before construction standard submarine motion equations are the most used hydrodynamic model in which more than 100 coefficients need to be estimated these coefficients have to be determined by captive model tests semi empirical method and potential flow method on the basis of existing approach the separately determining approach makes it difficult to assess model reliability this paper proposes a time efficient approach for the estimation of hydrodynamic coefficients using computational fluid dynamics cfd method instead of a repetitive and time consuming process the proposed spatial captive motion could provide all necessary information for determination of all required coefficients in only one simulation linear regression based on the least square method is employed to determine coefficients in hydrodynamic model statistical investigation correlation and significance analysis indicates that the standard submarine motion equations can be further simplified when submarine moving forward with small perturbations along other directions the final simplified motion equations have much fewer components than the original model while fitting accuracy remained validation results prove that spatial captive motion simulation and the simplification approach employed in this paper are effective and reliable it should have a large scope in further maneuverability research keywords computational fluid dynamics hydrodynamic coefficients maneuverability underwater vehicles 1 introduction the study of maneuvering characteristics have received considerable attention in the past and is becoming increasingly important in the design and operation of submarine this helps determine motion characteristics prior to the construction of vehicles and remedy any shortcomings at the redesign stage a carefully designed submarine should have good performance in both motion stability and maneuverability which are conflicted but interrelated most maneuvering characteristics studies are based on hydrodynamic motion equations looking at the commonly used standard submarine motion equations gertler and hagen 1967 as many as 100 coefficients need to be estimated if the 2nd taylor expansion method is employed the number would be over 200 an efficient and correct method for coefficient prediction is essential for the study of maneuvering characteristics free running test is the best approach for studying maneuvering characteristics dantas et al 2013 but the cost is quite high and the test accuracy could be easily affected by the experimental environment and measuring instruments captive model experiments have been widely used to predict coefficients since the 1950s planar motion mechanism pmm goodman and gertler 1962 and rotating arm ra burcher 1969 are the most common methods ra method could be used to determine the values of coefficients that represent the forces and moments as functions of yaw and pitch velocity it could also be used to obtain some values of cross coefficients related to angular velocity but it is difficult to obtain values of sway heave and most of the other cross coefficients another reason that the ra method is not widely applied is that it demands more experimental facilities and higher construction cost on the contrary the pmm costs less and can determine more information it could be used to simulate pure translation or rotation which would obtain the added masses values of coefficients that represent the forces and moments as functions of heave pitch sway and yaw combined with empirical formulas all the coefficients required for the submarine motion equations can be calculated captive model experiment was is and will be in the predictable future maintaining its primary role in coefficient estimation but the test plan and uncertainty analysis have to be carefully considered to make it more reliable sutulo and kim 1998 with improvements in computer technology computational fluid dynamics cfd is a fast moving field in hydrodynamic performance prediction of naval architecture stern et al 2013 2015 owing to its high efficiency and low cost to date cfd has been widely used to simulate pmm test kim et al 2015 ra test wu et al 2015 or other model tests mansoorzadeh and javanmard 2014 randeni et al 2015 singh et al 2017 to obtain the required coefficient values or to study hydrodynamic performance there has also been considerable study on the application of reynolds averaged naviers stokes rans formulation to the hydrodynamic performance analysis of submarine and other naval architectures araki et al 2012 fureby et al 2016 mansoorzadeh and javanmard 2014 motoki et al 2013 pan et al 2012 toxopeus et al 2012 another cfd developing area is free maneuvering simulation carrica et al 2010 chase et al 2013 shen et al 2015 those works prove that cfd is continuing advance at ever increasing speed and ever more impressive achievements as remarkable as model tests and cfd development are thus far the obtaining methods for hydrodynamic coefficients are still restricted to the pmm test ra test and related cfd simulations the investigation of coefficients for submarine only pays close attention to several primary factors there is still not an efficient approach to estimate all the required coefficients in submarine motion equations not to mention equation reliability assessment and coefficients significance tests in this study spatial captive motion using a cfd approach is developed to estimate all the hydrodynamic coefficients except body rudder propeller interaction related coefficients the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the main concepts and numerical methods section 3 describes the hydrodynamic coefficient estimation method on the basis of spatial captive motion simulation using a cfd approach section 4 discusses the equation accuracy and coefficients significance based on statistical method section 5 presents further experimental verification of the proposed approach section 6 reviews the achieved progress and proposes future developments for this study formulations presented in this paper closely follow

mathematical model motion can be described by the combination of two coordinate systems one is the earth fixed reference coordinate system and the other is the body fixed coordinate system as shown in fig 1 translations and rotations of submarine are defined with respect to the earth fixed coordinate system where linear and angular velocity and forces and moments are defined with respect to the body fixed coordinate system for a maneuvering submarine the relationship between motion variables and the hydrodynamic forces and moments can be represented by a mathematical model in terms of a series of coefficients standard submarine motion equations are commonly used in the submarine community as a typical mathematical model to represent the hydrodynamic forces and moments with respect to the body fixed coordinate system when rudder rotation and propeller performance are not considered hydrodynamic forces and moments can be defined as follows 1 x 1 2 ρ l 4 x q q q 2 x r r r 2 x r p r p

captive model tests including the oblique towing tests the ra tests and the pmm tests however the pmm model tests or cfd simulation could determine only fewer than 20 hydrodynamic coefficients besides to get more reliable coefficients repetitive tests or simulations with different velocities or frequencies have to be conducted to get their mean values in addition the other coefficients have to be obtained using semi empirical method and potential flow method but the semi empirical method cannot take the complete hydrodynamic arrangement into account and the potential flow method can only determine inertial hydrodynamic coefficients without consideration of water viscosity the inaccuracy of semi empirical method and potential flow method would also seriously impair the equation s reliability furthermore reliability of mathematical model cannot be ensured when hydrodynamic coefficients are determined separately by different approaches 3 spacial captive motion simulation to ensure reliability of mathematical model it would be best if all hydrodynamic coefficients can be determined by one approach and one simulation this can be reached if submarine moves irregularly in every direction while forces and moments being monitored at all time it could not be conducted in free running test and towing tank test this study proposes a novel approach spatial captive motion simulation in cfd to predict all the hydrodynamic coefficients in mathematical model by only one simulation 3 1 preliminary tests numerical simulation is performed with the commercial cfd code star ccm using the finite volume viscous and incompressible unsteady rans equations the k ω shear stress transport sst turbulence model is employed owing to its good prediction capability with reasonable computational cost works by lloyd and espanoles 2002 jak and hayes 2008 dantas and barros 2013 are taken as reference to guide design of simulation strategy grids of up to 16 4 million cells have been generated for darpa suboff whose geometric characteristics groves et al 1989 as shown in fig 2 in straight ahead to balance well between computational cost and simulation accuracy meshes are generated using the trimmed mesher embedded in star ccm the trimmed mesher generates 3d meshes containing a predominantly hexahedral mesh with minimal skewed cell user defined refinement can be done easily in any region it is quite an efficient and robust method of generating high quality grids for complex geometries the mesh size is increased from the suboff body surface to the outer region turbulence models require a reasonable thickness for the volume mesh adjacent to the body surface it is defined as a dimensionless wall distance y which is given as 7 y δ y ρ μ τ μ δ y v τ ω ρ all y wall treatment is applied to the solver it is a hybrid treatment for coarse meshes y is high and the near wall cell lies within logarithmic region while for fine meshes y is low enough to ensure that wall cells are within the buffer region a sub layer could be properly resolved using low reynolds number turbulence models fig 3 shows the mesh around the suboff generated by the trimmed mesher unsteady numerical simulations of the suboff in a straight ahead direction are performed differing from the frequently used method that converts an unsteady motion problem to a steady state problem the work in this study involves actual displacement of mesh vertices in real time simulations with grid sizes of up to 16 4 million cells are performed to determine the optimal mesh strategy to improve the simulation accuracy the straight ahead direction simulation at velocities of 5 92kn is simulated in star ccm the drag measured by experiment is 95 41n at a velocity of 5 92kn which corresponds to a reynolds number of about 1 4 106 liu and huang 1998 table 1 shows the relative error variation while increasing the mesh size when the mesh is coarse the simulation results are not entirely reliable the simulation accuracy does not improve when the mesh size is above a certain level to ensure simulation accuracy and reduce computation costs the grid size of 4 96 million is adopted to conduct the follow up research the relative error would be within 5 according to the preliminary investigations and test results the simulation strategy including viscous and incompressible unsteady rans equations k ω sst turbulence model the all y treatment trimmed mesher with user defined refinement is confirmed as a guideline for all simulations its validity is further proved in the subsequent comparisons between cfd and efd results 3 2 spacial captive motion simulation the relationship between motion variables and the hydrodynamic forces and moments can be taken as a model under consideration which can be written in the form 8 y x β ε where y is the vector of hydrodynamic forces or moments x is a matrix of known form of motion variables β is a vector of parameters and ε is a vector of errors if enough data information of motion variables and hydrodynamic forces or moments can be monitored in one simulation the vector of parameters can then be determined to address this the supposed time efficient simulation should have two essential features one is that velocities and accelerations u v w p q r u v w p q r are all gradually but constantly changing the other is that all motion information and their corresponding hydrodynamic forces and moments are monitored motion definition is important to reach reasonable hydrodynamic coefficients it should be as similar to motion in actual ocean environment as possible considering the fact that hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated on the basis of steady state assumption motion in a straight ahead direction with artificial random and smoothing perturbations is simulated in starccm for linear and angular velocities with respect to the body fixed coordinate system u v w p q r they can be defined as 9 v v 0 v p s i n 2 π f 1 t s i n 2 π f 2 t s i n 2 π f 3 t for the translation velocity along x axis v 0 should be cruising speed around which hydrodynamic coefficients would be calculated for other velocities v 0 should be zero to ensure coefficients identification available values of f i are well determined to make all velocities fully unrelated to each other forces and moments with respect to the body fixed coordinate system are monitored and recorded fig 4 shows the velocities and forces variation between time 280s and 300s 3 3 coefficient identification the mathematical model can be taken as a predictive model to an observed data set of hydrodynamic forces and velocities values taking sway force y as an example its mathematical model can be written as 10 y i β 1 y 1 i β 2 y 2 i β k y k i ε i where y is the hydrodynamic sway force y k are explanatory variables such as r p p p β k are coefficients to be estimated ε i are errors between monitored value and predicted value when such a model developed if additional velocity values are given without its accompanying hydrodynamic forces the fitted model can make a prediction of hydrodynamic forces this is a typical problem of regression analysis especially as all coefficients are linear hydrodynamic coefficients can be determined by linear regression the core issue is to identify proper value of β k to minimize the error ε i this objective can be reached by employing ordinary least squares approach draper et al 1998 which is conceptually simple and computationally straightforward a total time of 334s of spatial captive motion is simulated in star ccm it takes 64 6 h on a work station which is a 64 bit processor consist of 2 cpus intel xeon e5 2640 2 50 ghz and 48 gb accessible memory after an initial simulation of 15s the numerical flow field converges linear and angular velocities and accelerations u v w p q r u v w p q r and their corresponding forces and moments are then recorded every 0 2s the data ranges from 15s to 270s are adopted to obtain the hydrodynamic coefficients using linear regression based on the least square method the remaining data range from 320s to 330s is kept for validation as shown in fig 5 with the identified coefficients by linear regression the mathematical model shows perfect performance on accommodating all forces and moments to make the validation work more comparable the coefficient of determination r square is calculated 11 r s q u a r e s s r s s t where ssr is sum of squares of the regression 12 s s r i 1 n ω i y ˆ i y i 2 sst is the total sum of squares 13 sst i 1 n ω i y i y i 2 the closer to 1 the r square value is the more the equation fits the simulation result according to the r square values shown in table 2 with the identified coefficients by linear regression the mathematical model shows perfect performance on accommodating all forces and moments table 3 demonstrates the required number of simulations to determine hydrodynamic coefficients in standard submarine motion equations although repetitive simulations are required pmm and ra can determine very limited coefficients spacial captive motion simulation by contrast determines all coefficients in equation 1 6 in less time more importantly it can be used for accuracy assessment of hydrodynamic model r square values above 0 95 in all directions indicate that standard submarine motion equations are good enough to model suboff moving forward with small perturbations along other directions 4 analysis of mathematical model spacial captive test simulation helps determine all hydrodynamic coefficients efficiently but saving time is not its only advantage different from pmm and ra determining coefficients with repetitive simulations the complete data set from spacial captive test simulation offers a probability of further research on mathematical model correlational analyses help investigate relationships between components and total forces significance test can figure out unimportant components this can be applied to model simplification 4 1 investigation of hydrodynamic forces and moments according to definition in equation 10 all equations of hydrodynamic forces and moments can fall into some component forces or moments due to that velocities or accelerations are variable the correlation and dependence between components and total force can be quantified by pearson correlation coefficient pcc nicewander 1988 which is the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations the pcc can be calculated by 14 r p c c x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 k x 1 2 x 1 2 k x 2 2 x 2 2 k r p c c has a value between 1 and 1 it measures the linear dependence between two variables x 1 and x 2 r p c c 1 means two variables are total positive linear correlation and 1 means total negative linear correlation if r p c c 0 the two variables should be no linear correlation fig 6 shows all values of r p c c between each component force or moment and their corresponding total force or moment the number along the x axis is the order according to equation 1 6 for the force in the longitudinal axis x it is highly positive linear correlated with u and u 2 negative factors do not show as much correlation as positive ones sway force y and heave force z are most positive linear correlated with linear accelerations along y axis and z axis v and w respectively roll moment k is highly positive linear correlated with the product of u and p and negative linear correlated with p p pitch moment m and yaw moment n are most positive linear correlated with linear velocities along z axis and y axis w and v respectively according to the analysis result about correlation for over half of coefficients their values of r p c c with total force or moment are very closed to 0 it indicates that these component parts are uncorrelated to the total force or moment further investigation on their significances can be conducted if very limited importance is shown in the total force or moment the corresponding component part can be removed to simplify the original mathematical model 4 2 significance test and model simplification there are up to 88 coefficients need to be estimated in the original hydrodynamic model their significances should be highly different from each other some coefficients may show so limited influence to the total forces that can be eliminated this probability of eliminating can be evaluated by statistical hypothesis testing shao 2003 it is defined as 15 h 0 β i j 0 where β i j represents the jth coefficient of equation i null hypothesis h 0 means that the selected coefficient β i j is not significant and more probability be equal to zero the p value is proposed as the smallest level of significance at which we would reject the null hypothesis h 0 if the p value is closer to zero we come to the conclusion that the null hypothesis h 0 is false conversely if the p value is closer to one it suggests more probability of the corresponding coefficient being zero the p value is calculated to figure out the significance of all coefficients in motion equations as shown in fig 7 the closer to 1 the p value is the more probability that the null hypothesis of corresponding coefficient is satisfied among all coefficients removing the parameter whose corresponding p value is the highest will lead to the least impact on model accuracy on the basis of motion results from spacial captive motion simulation observation matrix and regression matrix can be reached and all coefficients can be determined using the previous introduced regression method then the significance test is conducted to figure out and eliminate unimportant coefficients finally a new simplified dynamic model with remained accuracy and less coefficients is acquired specific method information is depicted in fig 8 while simplifying the mathematical model 80 percent of the data are adopted to determine hydrodynamic coefficients and the rest are kept as cross validation study data for checking the model accuracy which is evaluated by the value of r square if the value of r square shows no obvious drop and maintains above 0 95 the coefficient with the least significance i e with the highest p value is to be figured out and removed the updated hydrodynamic model is then applied for parameters identification and model simplification the iteration continues until model accuracy drops obviously the final optimal hydrodynamic model is then determined fig 9 shows the r square variations when simplifying the motion equations as omitting coefficients the values of r square decrease very limited and maintain above 0 95 until certain iteration then they suddenly drop below 0 95 for the suboff motion in this paper the final simplified hydrodynamic model with the fewest coefficients and r square above 0 95 are given as 16 x 1 2 ρ l 3 x u u 1 2 ρ l 2 x u u u 2 17 y 1 2 ρ l 3 y v v 1 2 ρ l 3 y r u r 1 2 ρ l 2 y v u v 18 z 1 2 ρ l 3 z w w 1 2 ρ l 3 z q u q 1 2 ρ l 2 z w u w 19 k 1 2 ρ l 5 k p p 1 2 ρ l 4 k p u p 1 2 ρ l 4 k v v 1 2 ρ l 3 k u 2 1 2 ρ l 3 k v u v 20 m 1 2 ρ l 5 m q q 1 2 ρ l 4

describing properties of forces and moments acting on vehicle while moving forward with low oscillation furthermore according to the analysis result of correlation and significance some components in these equations have so limited impact on prediction of submarine performance that they could be removed specifically after reducing 69 parameters the final simplified hydrodynamic model with only 19 parameters also shows perfect fitting performance with values of r square above 0 95 to test the effectiveness of the simplified model and verify the ability of describing the change in forces and moments of cfd results a set of analyses are performed to compare with efd results by david taylor research center dtrc roddy 1990 table 4 reveals comparison of coefficients for the horizontal plane between cfd results by the approach employed in this paper and efd results by dtrc cfd results achieve reasonable agreement with efd results for most cases fig 10 a shows sway force y and yaw moment n obtained by cfd approach and their fitting curves according to hydrodynamic coefficients by cfd and efd respectively in addition the proportion of each coefficients on related force and moment equations are components analysis see fig 10 b and c as shown in figures the weight of each coefficient on the efd and cfd systems are almost the same in addition y r and n v which are removed from simplified equations also have the lowest share of sway force and yaw moment respectively and trending to zero in efd curves it can be figured out that despite with errors existing in table 4 the curves of force and moment have the same changing trend and high agreement with each other above all the proposed method could determine all required coefficients and their significance to corresponding forces and moments in only one simulation fitting comparison results suggest that the novel coefficient determination and model simplification method in this paper is efficient and reasonably reliable 5 verification and validation a submarine model constructed by harbin engineering university heu is applied to further validate the coefficient determination approach presented in this paper the model is designed referring to many well known submarines such as dragon of japanese u212a of germany etc the overall length of the model is 3 08 m it has a sail at bow two control surfaces symmetrically arranged both in horizontal and vertical planes aft the shape of its cross section is naca0012 5 1 experiment setup pmm tests were conducted to determine hydrodynamic coefficients of the heu submarine model a series of pmm tests pitching swaying heaving yawing and rolling were performed in the circulating water tunnel of the state key laboratory of science and technology on autonomous underwater vehicles at harbin engineering university china the circulating water tunnel as shown in fig 11 is 7 m in effective length 1 7 m in width and 1 5 m in depth with a steady velocity range of 0 2 m s to 2 0 m s a six component balance was fixed in the submarine model two rapiers were used to connect to the balance and hold the model still while water flowed past it the body was submerged in water of a depth three times the body diameter to minimize errors due to free surface as a further measure to minimize other effects on the force and moment measurements diameter of rapiers was tapered as small as possible 10 mm near the model surface fig 11 shows the heu submarine model under test previous works by yu and su 2010 and wang et al 2015 have shown good experimental accuracy 5 2 model simplification the heu submarine is simulated in numerical environment using the spacial captive motion simulation method its hull form and cfd domain is as shown in fig 12 when employing the standard submarine equations the hydrodynamic model also shows perfect fitting performance with values of r square above 0 95 along all 6 degrees of freedom fig 13 shows the r square variations when simplifying hydrodynamic model of the heu submarine model the variations of sway force and pitch moment are different from suboff suddenly drop does not happen until r square value below 0 90 this is mainly due to their geometry difference of sail and forward control surfaces the deleted coefficients are y p and y r for sway force and m w m w w m r p and m w for pitch moment when r square values drop between 0 95 and 0 90 some of these coefficients cannot be determined using pmm test the simplified hydrodynamic model with r square value above 0 90 is shown as 22 x

v 2 w 2 1 2 m w u w table 5 demonstrates comparison of hydrodynamic coefficients between cfd and efd results the hydrodynamic coefficients determined by cfd approach are in good agreement with efd result fig 14 shows variation of forces and moments by cfd simulation and their fitting curves according to hydrodynamic coefficients by cfd and efd respectively even though some coefficient errors in table 5 are as large as 30 their significance in hydrodynamic model is low the simplified hydrodynamic model with r square value above 0 90 show good agreement with curves fitted by efd coefficients as to motion equations for sway force and pitch moment with r square value above 0 95 they show better agreement with original cfd data it indicates that those additional coefficients in equations 28 and 29 are necessary to better predict hydrodynamic performance of heu submarine model whereas they are not easy to be estimated by pmm or ra tests the comparison results further prove that the spatial captive motion using cfd approach is efficient and reliable 6 conclusions model test which expends a mass of labor cost takes months to determine coefficients even its numerical simulation takes weeks they can only determine very limited coefficients and repetitive tests or simulations have to be conducted the developed spatial captive motion simulation method is very time efficient all hull related coefficients can be determined by only one simulation which can reduce time consumption to days or even shorter when high accuracy is unnecessary for conceptual design because the spacial captive motion simulation method can prove model validity easily if fitting performance are verified investigation on correlation and significance can help figure out which component shows so limited influence to the total forces that can be eliminated the final simplified hydrodynamic model with much less coefficient while fitting accuracy remained targeted simplification of hydrodynamic model can be conducted for submarines with different geometric characteristics simplification results indicate that a majority of components in standard submarine motion equations are not quite necessary for geometry like suboff and heu submarine comparisons between curves fitted by cfd and efd coefficients further prove the reliability of the proposed simulation and simplification method spatial captive motion simulation not only can produce good predictions of hydrodynamic coefficients in motion equations but also is appropriate for assessing reliability of a new hydrodynamic model besides investigating motions based on the steady state assumption it is expected to have a broader scope in maneuverability research on strong maneuver or other nonlinear motions our next steps will include simulation accuracy improvement and investigation of body rudder propeller interaction accuracy could be improved by employing a better turbulence model and more computer resources overset mesh and actuator disk will be coupled into the simulation approach to determine rudder rotation and propeller related coefficients acknowledgments this work was supported by the national key research and

reliability this paper proposes a time efficient approach for the estimation of hydrodynamic coefficients using computational fluid dynamics cfd method instead of a repetitive and time consuming process the proposed spatial captive motion could provide all necessary information for determination of all required coefficients in only one simulation linear regression based on the least square method is employed to determine coefficients in hydrodynamic model statistical investigation correlation and significance analysis indicates that the standard submarine motion equations can be further simplified when submarine moving forward with small perturbations along other directions the final simplified motion equations have much fewer components than the original model while fitting accuracy remained validation results prove that spatial captive motion simulation and the simplification approach employed in this paper are effective and reliable it should have a large scope in further maneuverability research keywords computational fluid dynamics hydrodynamic coefficients maneuverability underwater vehicles 1 introduction the study of maneuvering characteristics have received considerable attention in the past and is becoming increasingly important in the design and operation of submarine this helps determine motion characteristics prior to the construction of vehicles and remedy any shortcomings at the redesign stage a carefully designed submarine should have good performance in both motion stability and maneuverability which are conflicted but interrelated most maneuvering characteristics studies are based on hydrodynamic motion equations looking at the commonly used standard submarine motion equations gertler and hagen 1967 as many as 100 coefficients need to be estimated if the 2nd taylor expansion method is employed the number would be over 200 an efficient and correct method for coefficient prediction is essential for the study of maneuvering characteristics free running test is the best approach for studying maneuvering characteristics dantas et al 2013 but the cost is quite high and the test accuracy could be easily affected by the experimental environment and measuring instruments captive model experiments have been widely used to predict coefficients since the 1950s planar motion mechanism pmm goodman and gertler 1962 and rotating arm ra burcher 1969 are the most common methods ra method could be used to determine the values of coefficients that represent the forces and moments as functions of yaw and pitch velocity it could also be used to obtain some values of cross coefficients related to angular velocity but it is difficult to obtain values of sway heave and most of the other cross coefficients another reason that the ra method is not widely applied is that it demands more experimental facilities and higher construction cost on the contrary the pmm costs less and can determine more information it could be used to simulate pure translation or rotation which would obtain the added masses values of coefficients that represent the forces and moments as functions of heave pitch sway and yaw combined with empirical formulas all the coefficients required for the submarine motion equations can be calculated captive model experiment was is and will be in the predictable future maintaining its primary role in coefficient estimation but the test plan and uncertainty analysis have to be carefully considered to make it more reliable sutulo and kim 1998 with improvements in computer technology computational fluid dynamics cfd is a fast moving field in hydrodynamic performance prediction of naval architecture stern et al 2013 2015 owing to its high efficiency and low cost to date cfd has been widely used to simulate pmm test kim et al 2015 ra test wu et al 2015 or other model tests mansoorzadeh and javanmard 2014 randeni et al 2015 singh et al 2017 to obtain the required coefficient values or to study hydrodynamic performance there has also been considerable study on the application of reynolds averaged naviers stokes rans formulation to the hydrodynamic performance analysis of submarine and other naval architectures araki et al 2012 fureby et al 2016 mansoorzadeh and javanmard 2014 motoki et al 2013 pan et al 2012 toxopeus et al 2012 another cfd developing area is free maneuvering simulation carrica et al 2010 chase et al 2013 shen et al 2015 those works prove that cfd is continuing advance at ever increasing speed and ever more impressive achievements as remarkable as model tests and cfd development are thus far the obtaining methods for hydrodynamic coefficients are still restricted to the pmm test ra test and related cfd simulations the investigation of coefficients for submarine only pays close attention to several primary factors there is still not an efficient approach to estimate all the required coefficients in submarine motion equations not to mention equation reliability assessment and coefficients significance tests in this study spatial captive motion using a cfd approach is developed to estimate all the hydrodynamic coefficients except body rudder propeller interaction related coefficients the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the main concepts and numerical methods section 3 describes the hydrodynamic coefficient estimation

mathematical model motion can be described by the combination of two coordinate systems one is the earth fixed reference coordinate system and the other is the body fixed coordinate system as shown in fig 1 translations and rotations of submarine are defined with respect to the earth fixed coordinate system where linear and angular velocity and forces and moments are defined with respect to the body fixed coordinate system for a maneuvering submarine the relationship between motion variables and the hydrodynamic forces and moments can be represented by a mathematical model in terms of a series of coefficients standard submarine motion equations are commonly used in the submarine community as a typical mathematical model to represent the hydrodynamic forces and moments with respect to the body fixed coordinate system when rudder rotation and propeller performance are not considered hydrodynamic forces and moments can be defined as follows 1 x 1 2 ρ l 4 x q q q 2 x r r r 2 x r p r p

captive model tests including the oblique towing tests the ra tests and the pmm tests however the pmm model tests or cfd simulation could determine only fewer than 20 hydrodynamic coefficients besides to get more reliable coefficients repetitive tests or simulations with different velocities or frequencies have to be conducted to get their mean values in addition the other coefficients have to be obtained using semi empirical method and potential flow method but the semi empirical method cannot take the complete hydrodynamic arrangement into account and the potential flow method can only determine inertial hydrodynamic coefficients without consideration of water viscosity the inaccuracy of semi empirical method and potential flow method would also seriously impair the equation s reliability furthermore reliability of mathematical model cannot be ensured when hydrodynamic coefficients are determined separately by different approaches 3 spacial captive motion simulation to ensure reliability of mathematical model it would be best if all hydrodynamic coefficients can be determined by one approach and one simulation this can be reached if submarine moves irregularly in every direction while forces and moments being monitored at all time it could not be conducted in free running test and towing tank test this study proposes a novel approach spatial captive motion simulation in cfd to predict all the hydrodynamic coefficients in mathematical model by only one simulation 3 1 preliminary tests numerical simulation is performed with the commercial cfd code star ccm using the finite volume viscous and incompressible unsteady rans equations the k ω shear stress transport sst turbulence model is employed owing to its good prediction capability with reasonable computational cost works by lloyd and espanoles 2002 jak and hayes 2008 dantas and barros 2013 are taken as reference to guide design of simulation strategy grids of up to 16 4 million cells have been generated for darpa suboff whose geometric characteristics groves et al 1989 as shown in fig 2 in straight ahead to balance well between computational cost and simulation accuracy meshes are generated using the trimmed mesher embedded in star ccm the trimmed mesher generates 3d meshes containing a predominantly hexahedral mesh with minimal skewed cell user defined refinement can be done easily in any region it is quite an efficient and robust method of generating high quality grids for complex geometries the mesh size is increased from the suboff body surface to the outer region turbulence models require a reasonable thickness for the volume mesh adjacent to the body surface it is defined as a dimensionless wall distance y which is given as 7 y δ y ρ μ τ μ δ y v τ ω ρ all y wall treatment is applied to the solver it is a hybrid treatment for coarse meshes y is high and the near wall cell lies within logarithmic region while for fine meshes y is low enough to ensure that wall cells are within the buffer region a sub layer could be properly resolved using low reynolds number turbulence models fig 3 shows the mesh around the suboff generated by the trimmed mesher unsteady numerical simulations of the suboff in a straight ahead direction are performed differing from the frequently used method that converts an unsteady motion problem to a steady state problem the work in this study involves actual displacement of mesh vertices in real time simulations with grid sizes of up to 16 4 million cells are performed to determine the optimal mesh strategy to improve the simulation accuracy the straight ahead direction simulation at velocities of 5 92kn is simulated in star ccm the drag measured by experiment is 95 41n at a velocity of 5 92kn which corresponds to a reynolds number of about 1 4 106 liu and huang 1998 table 1 shows the relative error variation while increasing the mesh size when the mesh is coarse the simulation results are not entirely reliable the simulation accuracy does not improve when the mesh size is above a certain level to ensure simulation accuracy and reduce computation costs the grid size of 4 96 million is adopted to conduct the follow up research the relative error would be within 5 according to the preliminary investigations and test results the simulation strategy including viscous and incompressible unsteady rans equations k ω sst turbulence model the all y treatment trimmed mesher with user defined refinement is confirmed as a guideline for all simulations its validity is further proved in the subsequent comparisons between cfd and efd results 3 2 spacial captive motion simulation the relationship between motion variables and the hydrodynamic forces and moments can be taken as a model under consideration which can be written in the form 8 y x β ε where y is the vector of hydrodynamic forces or moments x is a matrix of known form of motion variables β is a vector of parameters and ε is a vector of errors if enough data information of motion variables and hydrodynamic forces or moments can be monitored in one simulation the vector of parameters can then be determined to address this the supposed time efficient simulation should have two essential features one is that velocities and accelerations u v w p q r u v w p q r are all gradually but constantly changing the other is that all motion information and their corresponding hydrodynamic forces and moments are monitored motion definition is important to reach reasonable hydrodynamic coefficients it should be as similar to motion in actual ocean environment as possible considering the fact that hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated on the basis of steady state assumption motion in a straight ahead direction with artificial random and smoothing perturbations is simulated in starccm for linear and angular velocities with respect to the body fixed coordinate system u v w p q r they can be defined as 9 v v 0 v p s i n 2 π f 1 t s i n 2 π f 2 t s i n 2 π f 3 t for the translation velocity along x axis v 0 should be cruising speed around which hydrodynamic coefficients would be calculated for other velocities v 0 should be zero to ensure coefficients identification available values of f i are well determined to make all velocities fully unrelated to each other forces and moments with respect to the body fixed coordinate system are monitored and recorded fig 4 shows the velocities and forces variation between time 280s and 300s 3 3 coefficient identification the mathematical model can be taken as a predictive model to an observed data set of hydrodynamic forces and velocities values taking sway force y as an example its mathematical model can be written as 10 y i β 1 y 1 i β 2 y 2 i β k y k i ε i where y is the hydrodynamic sway force y k are explanatory variables such as r p p p β k are coefficients to be estimated ε i are errors between monitored value and predicted value when such a model developed if additional velocity values are given without its accompanying hydrodynamic forces the fitted model can make a prediction of hydrodynamic forces this is a typical problem of regression analysis especially as all coefficients are linear hydrodynamic coefficients can be determined by linear regression the core issue is to identify proper value of β k to minimize the error ε i this objective can be reached by employing ordinary least squares approach draper et al 1998 which is conceptually simple and computationally straightforward a total time of 334s of spatial captive motion is simulated in star ccm it takes 64 6 h on a work station which is a 64 bit processor consist of 2 cpus intel xeon e5 2640 2 50 ghz and 48 gb accessible memory after an initial simulation of 15s the numerical flow field converges linear and angular velocities and accelerations u v w p q r u v w p q r and their corresponding forces and moments are then recorded every 0 2s the data ranges from 15s to 270s are adopted to obtain the hydrodynamic coefficients using linear regression based on the least square method the remaining data range from 320s to 330s is kept for validation as shown in fig 5 with the identified coefficients by linear regression the mathematical model shows perfect performance on accommodating all forces and moments to make the validation work more comparable the coefficient of determination r square is calculated 11 r s q u a r e s s r s s t where ssr is sum of squares of the regression 12 s s r i 1 n ω i y ˆ i y i 2 sst is the total sum of squares 13 sst i 1 n ω i y i y i 2 the closer to 1 the r square value is the more the equation fits the simulation result according to the r square values shown in table 2 with the identified coefficients by linear regression the mathematical model shows perfect performance on accommodating all forces and moments table 3 demonstrates the required number of simulations to determine hydrodynamic coefficients in standard submarine motion equations although repetitive simulations are required pmm and ra can determine very limited coefficients spacial captive motion simulation by contrast determines all coefficients in equation 1 6 in less time more importantly it can be used for accuracy assessment of hydrodynamic model r square values above 0 95 in all directions indicate that standard submarine motion equations are good enough to model suboff moving forward with small perturbations along other directions 4 analysis of mathematical model spacial captive test simulation helps determine all hydrodynamic coefficients efficiently but saving time is not its only advantage different from pmm and ra determining coefficients with repetitive simulations the complete data set from spacial captive test simulation offers a probability of further research on mathematical model correlational analyses help investigate relationships between components and total forces significance test can figure out unimportant components this can be applied to model simplification 4 1 investigation of hydrodynamic forces and moments according to definition in equation 10 all equations of hydrodynamic forces and moments can fall into some component forces or moments due to that velocities or accelerations are variable the correlation and dependence between components and total force can be quantified by pearson correlation coefficient pcc nicewander 1988 which is the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations the pcc can be calculated by 14 r p c c x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 k x 1 2 x 1 2 k x 2 2 x 2 2 k r p c c has a value between 1 and 1 it measures the linear dependence between two variables x 1 and x 2 r p c c 1 means two variables are total positive linear correlation and 1 means total negative linear correlation if r p c c 0 the two variables should be no linear correlation fig 6 shows all values of r p c c between each component force or moment and their corresponding total force or moment the number along the x axis is the order according to equation 1 6 for the force in the longitudinal axis x it is highly positive linear correlated with u and u 2 negative factors do not show as much correlation as positive ones sway force y and heave force z are most positive linear correlated with linear accelerations along y axis and z axis v and w respectively roll moment k is highly positive linear correlated with the product of u and p and negative linear correlated with p p pitch moment m and yaw moment n are most positive linear correlated with linear velocities along z axis and y axis w and v respectively according to the analysis result about correlation for over half of coefficients their values of r p c c with total force or moment are very closed to 0 it indicates that these component parts are uncorrelated to the total force or moment further investigation on their significances can be conducted if very limited importance is shown in the total force or moment the corresponding component part can be removed to simplify the original mathematical model 4 2 significance test and model simplification there are up to 88 coefficients need to be estimated in the original hydrodynamic model their significances should be highly different from each other some coefficients may show so limited influence to the total forces that can be eliminated this probability of eliminating can be evaluated by statistical hypothesis testing shao 2003 it is defined as 15 h 0 β i j 0 where β i j represents the jth coefficient of equation i null hypothesis h 0 means that the selected coefficient β i j is not significant and more probability be equal to zero the p value is proposed as the smallest level of significance at which we would reject the null hypothesis h 0 if the p value is closer to zero we come to the conclusion that the null hypothesis h 0 is false conversely if the p value is closer to one it suggests more probability of the corresponding coefficient being zero the p value is calculated to figure out the significance of all coefficients in motion equations as shown in fig 7 the closer to 1 the p value is the more probability that the null hypothesis of corresponding coefficient is satisfied among all coefficients removing the parameter whose corresponding p value is the highest will lead to the least impact on model accuracy on the basis of motion results from spacial captive motion simulation observation matrix and regression matrix can be reached and all coefficients can be determined using the previous introduced regression method then the significance test is conducted to figure out and eliminate unimportant coefficients finally a new simplified dynamic model with remained accuracy and less coefficients is acquired specific method information is depicted in fig 8 while simplifying the mathematical model 80 percent of the data are adopted to determine hydrodynamic coefficients and the rest are kept as cross validation study data for checking the model accuracy which is evaluated by the value of r square if the value of r square shows no obvious drop and maintains above 0 95 the coefficient with the least significance i e with the highest p value is to be figured out and removed the updated hydrodynamic model is then applied for parameters identification and model simplification the iteration continues until model accuracy drops obviously the final optimal hydrodynamic model is then determined fig 9 shows the r square variations when simplifying the motion equations as omitting coefficients the values of r square decrease very limited and maintain above 0 95 until certain iteration then they suddenly drop below 0 95 for the suboff motion in this paper the final simplified hydrodynamic model with the fewest coefficients and r square above 0 95 are given as 16 x 1 2 ρ l 3 x u u 1 2 ρ l 2 x u u u 2 17 y 1 2 ρ l 3 y v v 1 2 ρ l 3 y

describing properties of forces and moments acting on vehicle while moving forward with low oscillation furthermore according to the analysis result of correlation and significance some components in these equations have so limited impact on prediction of submarine performance that they could be removed specifically after reducing 69 parameters the final simplified hydrodynamic model with only 19 parameters also shows perfect fitting performance with values of r square above 0 95 to test the effectiveness of the simplified model and verify the ability of describing the change in forces and moments of cfd results a set of analyses are performed to compare with efd results by david taylor research center dtrc roddy 1990 table 4 reveals comparison of coefficients for the horizontal plane between cfd results by the approach employed in this paper and efd results by dtrc cfd results achieve reasonable agreement with efd results for most cases fig 10 a shows sway force y and yaw moment n obtained by cfd approach and their fitting curves according to hydrodynamic coefficients by cfd and efd respectively in addition the proportion of each coefficients on related force and moment equations are components analysis see fig 10 b and c as shown in figures the weight of each coefficient on the efd and cfd systems are almost the same in addition y r and n v which are removed from simplified equations also have the lowest share of sway force and yaw moment respectively and trending to zero in efd curves it can be figured out that despite with errors existing in table 4 the curves of force and moment have the same changing trend and high agreement with each other above all the proposed method could determine all required coefficients and their significance to corresponding forces and moments in only one simulation fitting comparison results suggest that the novel coefficient determination and model simplification method in this paper is efficient and reasonably reliable 5 verification and validation a submarine model constructed by harbin engineering university heu is applied to further validate the coefficient determination approach presented in this paper the model is designed referring to many well known submarines such as dragon of japanese u212a of germany etc the overall length of the model is 3 08 m it has a sail at bow two control surfaces symmetrically arranged both in horizontal and vertical planes aft the shape of its cross section is naca0012 5 1 experiment setup pmm tests were conducted to determine hydrodynamic coefficients of the heu submarine model a series of pmm tests pitching swaying heaving yawing and rolling were performed in the circulating water tunnel of the state key laboratory of science and technology on autonomous underwater vehicles at harbin engineering university china the circulating water tunnel as shown in fig 11 is 7 m in effective length 1 7 m in width and 1 5 m in depth with a steady velocity range of 0 2 m s to 2 0 m s a six component balance was fixed in the submarine model two rapiers were used to connect to the balance and hold the model still while water flowed past it the body was submerged in water of a depth three times the body diameter to minimize errors due to free surface as a further measure to minimize other effects on the force and moment measurements diameter of rapiers was tapered as small as possible 10 mm near the model surface fig 11 shows the heu submarine model under test previous works by yu and su 2010 and wang et al 2015 have shown good experimental accuracy 5 2 model simplification the heu submarine is simulated in numerical environment using the spacial captive motion simulation method its hull form and cfd domain is as shown in fig 12 when employing the standard submarine equations the hydrodynamic model also shows perfect fitting performance with values of r square above 0 95 along all 6 degrees of freedom fig 13 shows the r square variations when simplifying hydrodynamic model of the heu submarine model the variations of sway force and pitch moment are different from suboff suddenly drop does not happen until r square value below 0 90 this is mainly due to their geometry difference of sail and forward control surfaces the deleted coefficients are y p and y r for sway force and m w m w w m r p and m w for pitch moment when r square values drop between 0 95 and 0 90 some of these coefficients cannot be determined using pmm test the simplified hydrodynamic model with r square value above 0 90 is shown as 22 x

v 2 w 2 1 2 m w u w table 5 demonstrates comparison of hydrodynamic coefficients between cfd and efd results the hydrodynamic coefficients determined by cfd approach are in good agreement with efd result fig 14 shows variation of forces and moments by cfd simulation and their fitting curves according to hydrodynamic coefficients by cfd and efd respectively even though some coefficient errors in table 5 are as large as 30 their significance in hydrodynamic model is low the simplified hydrodynamic model with r square value above 0 90 show good agreement with curves fitted by efd coefficients as to motion equations for sway force and pitch moment with r square value above 0 95 they show better agreement with original cfd data it indicates that those additional coefficients in equations 28 and 29 are necessary to better predict hydrodynamic performance of heu submarine model whereas they are not easy to be estimated by pmm or ra tests the comparison results further prove that the spatial captive motion using cfd approach is efficient and reliable 6 conclusions model test which expends a mass of labor cost takes months to determine coefficients even its numerical simulation takes weeks they can only determine very limited coefficients and repetitive tests or simulations have to be conducted the developed spatial captive motion simulation method is very time efficient all hull related coefficients can be determined by only one simulation which can reduce time consumption to days or even shorter when high accuracy is unnecessary for conceptual design because the spacial captive motion simulation method can prove model validity easily if fitting performance are verified investigation on correlation and significance can help figure out which component shows so limited influence to the total forces that can be eliminated the final simplified hydrodynamic model with much less coefficient while fitting accuracy remained targeted simplification of hydrodynamic model can be conducted for submarines with different geometric characteristics simplification results indicate that a majority of components in standard submarine motion equations are not quite necessary for geometry like suboff and heu submarine comparisons between curves fitted by cfd and efd coefficients further prove the reliability of the proposed simulation and simplification method spatial captive motion simulation not only can produce good predictions of hydrodynamic coefficients in motion equations but also is appropriate for assessing reliability of a new hydrodynamic model besides investigating motions based on the steady state assumption it is expected to have a broader scope in maneuverability research on strong maneuver or other nonlinear motions our next steps will include simulation accuracy improvement and investigation of body rudder propeller interaction accuracy could be improved by employing a better turbulence model and more computer resources overset mesh and actuator disk will be coupled into the simulation approach to determine rudder rotation and propeller related coefficients acknowledgments this work was supported by the national key research and

23509,laboratory tests were carried out to characterize the multi mode vortex induced vibrations viv of a yawed flexible cylinder in a uniform flow five yaw angles in relation to the direction orthogonal to the oncoming flow were adopted i e a 0 15 30 45 and 60 in this paper in order to simulate the uniform flow the flexible cylinder model with a mass ratio of 1 90 and an aspect ratio of 350 was towed by a carriage with the towing velocity varying from 0 05 m s to 1 0 m s in a towing tank the corresponding reynolds numbers approximately fell in the range of 800 16000 the effects of yaw angle on the multi mode response of the yawed flexible cylinder subjected to viv were investigated and discussed based on the experimental results it can be found that the maximum values of response amplitudes in both cross flow cf and in line il directions show a slight upward trend when the yaw angle increases from 0 to 60 the peak value of strouhal number of the yawed cylinder is about 5 larger than that of the normal incidence one a 0 the multi mode viv response occurs even at a yaw angle as high as 60 in addition particular attention was paid to the validity of the independence principle ip which assumes that the yawed and normal incidence cylinder cases are comparable if only the oncoming flow velocity normal component is applied to scale the physical quantities the experimental results indicate that the ip seems to be a reasonable hypothesis for examining the multi mode viv of a yawed flexible cylinder for a 30 and some discrepancies gradually appear as the yaw angle increases from 45 to 60 keywords yawed flexible cylinder vortex induced vibrations viv independence principle ip yaw angle fluid structure interaction fsi 1 introduction vortex induced vibrations viv of cylindrical structures enduring fluid flows is a ubiquitous and complicated fluid structure interaction fsi phenomenon in offshore engineering this type of oscillation often driven at high frequencies over extended periods of time may lead to severe structural failure of the member due to fatigue damage accumulation much attention has been focused on this canonical fsi problem and many excellent findings have been reported in recent years pesce and fujarra 2000 chaplin et al 2005 baarholm et al 2006 lie and kaasen 2006 guo and lou 2008 huera huarte and bearman 2009a 2009b lee and allen 2010 song et al 2011 gao et al 2015 pavlovskaia et al 2016 gedikli and dahl 2017 however the majority of previous investigations on viv of cylinders are the cases where the oncoming flow direction is perpendicular to the span wise axis of the structure in reality the flow direction may be inclined to the structural axis such as viv of mooring lines free spanning pipelines and steel catenary risers when a circular cylinder is not normal to the oncoming flow with a large yaw angle the flow velocity in the axial direction of the structure may not be negligible and vortex shedding from a yawed cylinder is different from that of a normal incidence cylinder in a cross flow in order to better understanding of the effect of cylinder inclination on the flow behaviors a large number of researchers have conducted studies of the flow around yawed fixed cylinders both experimentally in a wind tunnel or water flume ramberg 1983 vlachos and telionis 2008 zhou et al 2009 2010 franzini et al 2014 najafi et al 2016 and numerically lucor and karniadakis 2003 yeo and jones 2008 zhao et al 2009 for yaw angle up to 75 an approach called independence principle ip was proposed to estimate the vortex shedding characteristics of cylinders inclined to the oncoming flow hanson 1966 van atta 1968 the ip suggests that the yawed cylinder can be treated as the normal incidence one if only the component of the free flow velocity normal to the cylinder axis is considered the ip ignores the influence of component of the flow velocity parallel to the cylinder axis which is legit for small yaw angles but not when the yaw angle increases to a large value ramberg 1983 zhao et al 2009 herein the yaw angle a is defined as the angle between the cylinder axis and the direction orthogonal to the oncoming flow compared to the fixed cylinder case a vibration of the cylinder tends to force parallel shedding ramberg 1983 lucor and karniadakis 2003 this further indicates that the ip could be reasonable over a wide range of yaw angles for an elastically mounted rigid cylinder subjected to viv franzini et al 2009 carried out experiments on viv of yawed rigid cylinders elastically mounted on a water tunnel the reynolds numbers were in the range of 2000 8000 and the yaw angles were 0 20 and 45 it was observed that the displacement amplitudes measured fluid forces and added mass partially agreed with the results of a normal incidence cylinder oscillating in cf direction franzini et al 2013 performed 1 dof degree of freedom and 2 dof viv experiments of yawed cylinders to investigate the validity of the ip for properly describing the flow characteristics and the oscillation of structures subjected to oblique flow five yaw angles a 0 10 20 30 and 45 in both upstream and downstream orientations were tested it was found that the displacement amplitude showed reasonably good agreement with that of normal incidence ones for yaw angles up to 20 while for yaw angles larger than 20 a decrease in the maximum amplitude was observed jain and modarres sadeghi 2013 conducted a series of experiments on an elastically mounted rigid cylinder placed into an oncoming flow with various yaw angles a 0 75 it was illustrated that the ip was qualitatively valid for the yaw angles of 0 20 45 and 55 but failed with larger ones a 65 and 75 zhao 2015 numerically investigated the viv of an elastically mounted rigid cylinder with a yaw angle of 45 to check the validity of the ip it was shown that the displacement amplitudes and vibration frequencies of the yawed cylinder agreed very well with those of a normal incidence one despite the numerous investigations regarding the viv of an elastically mounted yawed rigid cylinder the problem of oscillation of a yawed flexible cylinder placed in a free stream has received much less attention king 1977 experimentally investigated the self excited oscillations of a yawed flexible cylinder for reynolds number in the range 2000 20000 and for yaw angles 45 a 45 it was observed that the ip could reasonably predict the upper and lower limits of the reduced velocity region in which the lock in phenomenon occurred with only a slight decrease in the maximum amplitude bourguet et al 2015 studied the viv of a flexible cylinder with a yaw angle of 60 an aspect ratio of 50 and the reynolds number of 500 by using dns method particular attention was paid to the validity of the ip it was pointed out that the ip was valid in the cases with a high axial tension in contrast the behaviors of the fluid structure system clearly deviated from the ip when the axial tension was low bourguet and triantafyllou 2015 further numerically investigated the viv of a flexible cylinder with a very large yaw angle of 80 comparison of the vibration responses and fluid forces between the yawed and normal incidence cylinder configurations showed that the behaviors of the fluid structure system drastically departed from the ip recently seyed aghazadeh et al 2015 performed an experimental investigation on the cf viv of a curved flexible cylinder in the convex and concave orientations with a reynolds number range of re 300 2300 it was found the displacement amplitude in both configurations was decreased compared to a normal incidence straight cylinder with the same mass ratio in addition the higher harmonic components both the second and the third harmonic components were observed in flow forces acting on the curved cylinder more recently zhu et al 2016 conducted experimental studies of a curved flexible pipe with an aspect ratio of 108 in a shear flow the curved pipe was fully immersed in a re circulating water channel and the maximum reynolds number was 1129 it was found that different vibration frequencies exist at different positions of the pipe with the presentation of multi mode response and eight shape trajectories appear in the middle part of the pipe while the trajectories evolve to half moon format at the two ends of the pipe han et al 2017 performed a towing tank experiment of viv of an inclined flexible cylinder with a 45 to investigate the response characteristics it was observed that the cf response amplitude could be up to a value of 3 0d and the il one more than 1 1d as mentioned above while much work has been done on viv of yawed elastically mounted cylinders in a flow little attention has been paid to viv of a yawed flexible cylinder in particular long flexible cylinders used in offshore engineerings such as marine risers and cables may exhibit multi mode viv when exposed to fluid flows such vibrations can be of serious consequence as they provide a potent source of fatigue this paper experimentally studied the viv of a yawed flexible cylinder with yaw angle varying from 0 to 60 with an increment of 15 the aspect ratio of the flexible cylinder was 350 the mass ratio was 1 90 and the reynolds number ranged from 800 to 16000 the main aim is to investigate the effects of yaw angle on the multi mode response of the yawed flexible cylinder with high aspect ratio and low mass ratio undergoing vortex shedding and produce a new dataset which hopefully will stimulate new experiments and more numerical studies another purpose is to check the validity of the ip applied to the viv of a yawed flexible cylinder based on present experimental results the organization of the paper is as follows section 2 describes the details of the experimental set up the methods for strain signals pre processing and displacement response reconstruction are introduced in section 3 section 4 presents and discusses the experimental results of viv of the yawed flexible cylinder with five yaw angles finally several important conclusions are listed 2 experimental arrangement the laboratory experiment was carried out in a 137 0 m 7 0 m 3 3 m length width depth towing tank at the state key laboratory of hydraulic engineering simulation and safety tianjin university the test apparatus had several principal parts including a supporting structure two vertical supporting units a flexible cylinder model and an axial tension system the sketch of the test apparatus is shown in fig 1 several vertical and horizontal steel beams consisted of the supporting structure while the vertical supporting unit was composed of an angle plate a vertical supporting rod a supporting plate and a guide plate the vertical supporting rod was joined with the supporting plate at the bottom end and the angle plate at the top end the angle plate as illustrated in fig 2 was used to change the yaw angle of the cylinder in relation to the direction perpendicular to the carriage motion five yaw angles were tested namely a 0 15 30 45 and 60 aiming to eliminate the disturbing flow generated by the supporting plates and supporting rods two guide plates were installed on the supporting plates by using several long bolts in the experiment these guide plates were rotated to be parallel to the oncoming flow two reinforcing rods were connected to the supporting structure and the vertical supporting rods in order to withstand the loads during the tests a universal joint was used to connect one end of the cylinder model with one supporting plate and a steel wire was connected to the flexible cylinder at the other end the steel wire passed through small holes in the guide and supporting plates on one end and was connected to a spring at the other end the spring was used to adjust a gradual variation of axial tension on the cylinder model during the tests the tensioner was adjusted keeping the axial tension in all tests equaled to 300 n a load cell was adopted to measure the axial tension on the vibrating flexible cylinder a pulley which was attached to one supporting plate was employed to realize the direction change of steel wire the flexible cylinder model as shown in fig 3 was a coaxial composite tube with a length of 5 6 m the inner part was made of a copper pipe with an outer diameter of 8 0 mm and a wall thickness of 1 0 mm the outer part was made of a silicone tube with an outer diameter d of 16 0 mm and a wall thickness of 4 0 mm the mass per unit length m s of the cylinder model including the mass of the measuring instruments was 0 3821 kg m resulting in a dimensionless mass ratio m 4m s ρπd 2 of 1 90 where ρ is the water density the bending stiffness ei and axial stiffness ea of the cylinder model were 17 45 nm2 and 2 793 106 n respectively where e was young s modulus of copper i was the moment of inertia of the inner copper pipe and a was the cross section area of the inner copper pipe because the outer silicone tube is soft its contribution to the bending stiffness and axial stiffness could be neglected the axial tension was directly employed on the inner copper pipe fourteen pairs of strain gages were attached to outer surface of the copper pipe seven of those were oriented in the x direction in line il while the others were in the y direction cross flow cf the measurement points were evenly distributed along the cylinder model as illustrated in fig 3a a cross section view of the cylinder model is shown in fig 3b the aspect ratio length diameter of the cylinder model was 350 in addition the outer silicone tube could provide a smooth external surface and protect the measuring instrumentation the key parameters of the cylinder model are listed in table 1 the cylinder model was submerged in still water and 1 0 m from the free surface to eliminate the free surface effects the test schematics is illustrated in fig 4 the uniform flow was generated by towing the cylinder model along the tank in still water from 0 05 m s to 1 0 m s with an interval of 0 05 m s and the reynolds number was in the range of 800 16000 each experimental run lasted for 50s with the first portion containing transients ignored more than 100 oscillation cycles in cf direction could be obtained during the sample time of each run the interval between two consecutive runs was at least 15 min a total of 100 runs were performed the sampling frequency of the measuring instruments was 100 hz which was sufficient to avoid aliasing problems 3 data analysis 3 1 definition of reduced velocity in this paper the reduced velocity is defined as 1 v r u cos α f 1 d where u is the towing carriage velocity f 1 is the fundamental frequency 1st mode frequency of the cylinder in still water calculated from 2 f n n 2 l t m n π l 2 e i m where f n is the nth order eigenfrequency of the cylinder n is the order of mode m is the total mass including structural mass m s and added mass m a ρπd 2 4 the reduced velocity v r range extended to a maximum value of 30 64 for the tested cases 3 2 measured strain signals pre processing a pretension of 300 n was applied to the axis of the flexible cylinder for all test cases g1 g7 represent the measurement locations of the strain gages see fig 3a the il strain contains three parts a tensile strain caused by axial pretension a bending strain caused by mean drag force and a viv induced bending strain according to the assumptions that the time averaged bending strain caused by viv is zero and the time averaged tensile strain caused by axial pretension and time averaged bending strain caused by mean drag force are temporally invariant the il viv bending strain can be calculated by subtracting the time averaged values from the strain data the cf viv bending strain can be computed using a similar method except that the cf strain signal includes only two parts i e a tensile strain caused by axial pretension and a viv induced bending strain this method was extensively used in many experimental studies song et al 2011 2016 gao et al 2015 then the bending strain was high pass filtered with a cutoff of 1 0 hz to eliminate the low frequency noise caused by the carriage motion and supporting structure vibration moreover the bending strain was further low pass filtered with a cutoff of 40 0 hz to remove the high frequency electromagnetic noise fig 5 shows an example of the signal processing and band pass filtering of the il strain signal measured at g4 with a 30 and v r 13 27 the top sub plot shows the original strain signal the middle one presents the viv bending strain by removing the strain caused by axial pretension and mean drag the bottom sub plot shows the band pass filtered viv bending strain together with the unfiltered signal it can be clearly observed that the bending strain is smoothed and some unwanted frequency components are eliminated the test runs in the experiment were generally carried out once due to the large test matrix more than 100 runs investigated however to check the system sensitivity and consistency the test runs with particular yaw angle case a 15 were repeated three times and the results of maximum rms strain in cf and il directions are shown in fig 6 it can be observed that the maximum relative error is smaller than 10 which indicates that the experimental results of strain are reliable and consistent 3 3 displacement response reconstruction the modal analysis introduced in lie and kaasen 2006 was used to reconstruct viv displacement response of the cylinder this method has been successfully applied in the reconstruction of viv of flexible cylinders using the strain or acceleration signals measured at limited sampling points trim et al 2005 lie and kaasen 2006 song et al 2011 gao et al 2015 base on the linear decomposition hypothesis the time varying viv displacement response of a cylinder can be taken as the sum of a series of modal components taking the reconstruction of cf viv displacement as an example the response can be expressed as 3 y z t n 1 φ n z w n t where y z t is the cf displacement z is the coordinate along the axis of the cylinder t is time φ n z is the modal shape w n t is the modal weight and n is the order of vibration mode the pretension cylinder can be simplified as a bernoulli euler beam with pined pined boundary conditions the modal shape of displacement can be written as 4 φ n z sin π n z l where l is the cylinder length the relationship between curvature and strain is 5 ε z t r n 1 π n l 2 sin π n z l w n t where r is the outer radius of the copper pipe in eq 5 only modal weight w n t is unknown and can be calculated using the filtered viv bending strain signals fig 7 shows a typical example of modal analysis technique used in this paper to reconstruct the viv displacement response of the flexible cylinder with a 15 and v r 11 84 it can be found that the first three modes are significantly excited and the 2nd mode dominates the maximum displacement amplitude is obtained at g2 with a peak value larger than 2 0d 4 results and discussion in this section the experimental results for the natural frequencies in still water dominant frequency and dominant mode maximum displacement amplitude time series and frequency response of displacement as well as comparison of multi mode response of normal incidence a 0 cylinder with yawed one at different yaw angles a 15 30 45 and 60 are presented and discussed 4 1 natural frequencies in still water because the natural frequency is very important for the experimental setup and results in analysis first free decaying tests of the cylinder model in still water were performed to obtain the natural frequencies of the flexible cylinder at all five yaw angle cases a hammer was applied to hit the middle point of the flexible cylinder to excite vibrations in cf and il directions respectively the natural frequency of the cylinder in water was obtained by using a fast fourier transform fft to the time history of the strain at the measurement point g4 table 2 lists the natural frequencies of the cylinder model in still water the first 7 mode frequencies of the cylinder model were compared with the analytical values estimated by eq 2 it should be noted the measured value of the first natural frequency is a slight difference among the cases with different yaw angles hence the reduced velocity was calculated by using the analytical frequency value from eq 2 another purpose of free decaying tests was to evaluate the performance of strain gages used in present experimental study it can be found that the experimental data agree quite well with the analytical values with an error less than 6 which could provide strong evidence of the high accuracy of the measurement instruments also it could prove that the whole experimental system featured with varying yaw angle of the cylinder is reliable 4 2 dominant frequencies and dominant modes fig 8 illustrates the dimensionless dominant frequencies f f 1 in cf and il directions versus the reduced velocity it should be pointed out that f 1 is the theoretical value of the first natural frequency calculated by eq 2 the dominant frequency f was taken as the largest peak in the spectra plot obtained by using the fft of the time varying displacement linear fits to the cf frequencies using the least square method were also superimposed on the plots together with lines with doubled slopes it can be observed that the dominant frequencies of the il and cf displacement responses roughly follow a doubled relationship for the cases with different yaw angles the slope of the cf fitting lines i e the strouhal number defined as st f s d ucosa where f s is the vortex shedding frequency it is nearly same as the dominant frequency of cf viv f y in the lock in region ranges from 0 159 to 0 171 the strouhal number is 0 163 for the cases with a 0 and 15 gradually increases to 0 164 at a 30 and 0 171 at a 45 then sharply drops to 0 159 at a 60 the peak value of strouhal number is approximately 5 larger than that of the normal incidence cylinder in order to further investigate the effect of yaw angle on the strouhal number fig 9 shows the ratios between st and st 0 where st 0 is the strouhal number at a 0 for comparison the strouhal numbers of yawed fixed rigid cylinders placed into an oncoming flow from previous numerical simulations zhao et al 2009 and experimental studies van atta 1968 ramberg 1983 zhou et al 2009 najafi et al 2016 are also drawn in fig 9 present experimental data show good agreement with those of previous numerical and experimental results when the yaw angle is not larger than 30 the strouhal number in the present experiment is slightly smaller than the empirically fitted curve of van atta 1968 when the yaw angle is up to 45 as the yaw angle increases from 45 to 60 all these previous experimental data show a gradually increasing trend except the numerical results of zhao et al 2009 and present experimental data in which a mild decreasing trend can be observed there is also obvious difference during present experimental results previous experimental data van atta 1968 ramberg 1983 zhou et al 2009 najafi et al 2016 and numerical simulation results zhao et al 2009 when the yaw angle is in the range of 45o 60 the discrepancies among these data might be attributed to the flow quality end effects aspect ratio and reynolds number etc najafi et al 2016 fig 10 presents the cf and il dominant modes of vibration versus the reduced velocity at five yaw angle cases it should point out that the dominant mode is the mode which has the largest modal weight from eq 5 the maximum dominant mode is 4 order for a 0 and 15 3 order for a 30 and 45 and 2 order for a 60 in cf direction while 6 order as a 30 5 order for a 45 and 4 order for a 60 in il direction it can be seen from fig 10 that the dominant mode shows a staircase like shape upon closer inspection it can be found that higher order modes in cf direction are more easily excited at the same reduced velocity for the case with a larger yaw angle e g when vr 9 2 and 19 9 a similar trend also can be observed in il direction 4 3 displacement amplitude fig 11 shows the maxima of root mean square rms dimensionless amplitude in cf and il directions versus the reduced velocity note that the mean deformation of the flexible cylinder was subtracted from the il displacement data when the yaw angle is 0 15 30 45 and 60 the peak value of maximum rms dimensionless displacement is approximately 1 43d 1 48d 1 51d 1 55d and 1 62d in cf direction and 0 41d 0 41d 0 50d 0 51d and 0 51d in il direction these results indicate there is a slight upward trend for the peak value of the maximum rms displacement with the increase of yaw angle this is different from the experimental results of viv of an elastically mounted yawed rigid cylinder of franzini et al 2013 and jain and modarres sadeghi 2013 in which the amplitude response significantly decreases when the yaw angle is larger than 20 this discrepancy could be caused by the use of a rigid cylinder instead of a flexible cylinder in their experiments another possible reason can be attributed to the asymmetric boundary conditions adopted in their experimental set up a yawed cylinder which pierced the free surface of the oncoming flow was partially submerged in the water in their experimental investigations the free end of the cylinder and free surface of the flow affects vortex shedding in addition it can be found from fig 11 that the maximum amplitude of the yawed flexible cylinder is achieved at a lower reduced velocity with increasing yaw angle it should be noticed that there are several obvious drops in the maximum rms amplitude e g v r 9 0 and 17 5 this drop could be contributed to the switching of the mode of vibration of the cylinder model compared to the cf amplitudes the rms il amplitudes show similar but more scattered results which could be attributed to the higher mode of vibration 4 4 time series and frequency response of displacement for further examining the typical displacement response and vibration frequency spectra of a yawed flexible cylinder with varying yaw angle in the mode transition region figs 12 and 13 give the time histories of displacement and frequency spectra at seven measurement points in cf and il directions the top sub plot shows the time varying displacement for the time range of 20 40s and the bottom sub plot gives the displacement response spectra which were produced by fft analysis of the displacement data and the first to fifth columns are corresponding to five yaw angle cases a 0 15 30 45 and 60 respectively in the figures it can be seen in figs 12 and 13 that displacement amplitude varies at different measurement points the sampling locations with larger amplitudes are close to the positions of mode antinode while the smaller values of amplitude are near the node of the dominant mode taking il vibration with a 15 and v r 8 88 for example the 4th mode is excited see fig 10 for this case and the measurement positions g1 g3 g5 and g7 close to the antinode while g2 g4 and g6 are corresponding to the positions of mode nodes moreover it can be observed that the viv responses in both cf and il directions consisted of one or two strong frequency peaks and a few very weak frequency peaks a similar phenomenon has been found in the experimental investigations on viv of the normal incidence and curved flexible cylinder in uniform and shear flows xu et al 2009 zhu et al 2016 these results indicate that multi mode viv response apparently occurs in present experimental work especially in il direction in addition it can be clearly seen that the time varying displacements and response frequencies at measurement points are nearly the same for a 0 15 and 30 in both cf and il directions the maximum displacement amplitudes in the cf and il directions are up to 1 0d and 0 5d respectively when yaw angle is larger than 45 in figs 12e and 13e the flexible cylinder yawed at 60 still exhibits regular cf and il viv a similar trend has been observed by bourguet et al 2015 in the numerical studies of viv of a yawed flexible cylinder with a 60 and re 500 and more strong frequency peaks are found in the frequency spectra plots especially in il direction as the yaw angle increases from 45 to 60 in the present experimental work 4 5 multi mode viv response of the yawed flexible cylinder in the following section figs 14 17 are drawn to investigate the multi mode viv characteristics of the yawed flexible cylinder and compare the multi mode response of the normal incidence cylinder a 0 with the yawed ones a 15 30 45 and 60 respectively these figures have the same configuration the first column graph presents space time varying cf and il displacement contour in a time interval from 32 to 33s the second column graph shows the spanwise evolutions of the rms values for the dimensionless cf and il displacement the third column graph illustrates the time histories of cf and il displacement at seven measurement points in a time interval from 30 to 35s for describing the characteristics of response clearly the final column graph gives the response trajectories at seven measurement points g1 g7 fig 14 presents the results of the comparison of the yawed flexible cylinder with a 15 and v r 29 11 with the normal incidence one at v r 29 59 it can be observed the vibrations exhibit similar behaviors such as the 4 order oscillation is dominant in cf direction while 6 order in il direction the maximum cf and il rms displacements are nearly 1 1d and 0 4d respectively the rms displacements in cf and il directions are obviously not close to zero which indicates that the overall viv response is a combination of standing wave and traveling wave behavior however it is still dominated by the standing wave in both cf and il directions in addition it is clearly seen most of the response trajectories at measurement points are the eight shape figure which is induced by that the il dominant oscillation frequency is twice that cf fig 15 shows the multi mode viv responses of the yawed flexible cylinder with a 30 and v r 19 91 compared with the normal incidence one at v r 19 90 it can be found that slightly different vibration behaviors exist the cf and il dominant modes are 2 order and 4 order for a 0 while 3 order and 5 order for a 30 the peak values of cf and il rms displacement for a 0 are both slightly larger than that of a 30 the combination of standing wave and traveling wave consists of the overall viv response in cf and il directions for both a 0 and a 30 motion trajectories at measurement points for a 0 are apparently different with that of a 30 as shown in fig 16 there is an obvious distinction between the viv for the normal incidence cylinder and cylinder yawed at a 45 for a 0 the dominant modes are 2nd and 4th in cf and il directions respectively and the maximum cf and il rms displacements are 1 3d and 0 3d the motion trajectories at measurement points for a 0 is slightly irregular for a 45 3 order mode dominates both cf and il viv the peak values of cf and il rms displacements are about 1 0d and 0 4d it is observed that the trajectories are ellipses format at measurement positions which could be attributed that the dominant oscillation frequency in il direction is nearly the same as that in cf direction as the yaw angle increases to 60 it can be found the dynamic responses of the yawed cylinder subjected to viv are partly inconsistent with those of the normal incidence one at the same reduced velocity in fig 17 the cf and il responses are dominated by 2nd mode and 4th mode for both a 0 and 60 compared with the normal incidence case the maximum rms il displacement of the yawed cylinder is about two times larger however the maxima of rms cf displacements for a 0 is nearly same with that of a 60 in addition both the normal incidence and yawed flexible cylinder vibrations have no stable motion trajectories as shown in fig 17 due to that the cf and il vibrations exhibit several modal frequencies which result in no stable phase differences of the vibrations between two directions 4 6 validity of ip applied to the viv of a yawed flexible cylinder the ip assumes that the responses including displacement amplitude vibration frequency mode of vibration for a flexible cylinder etc of an inclined cylinder undergoing vortex induced vibration are similar to those of a cylinder in normal incident flow if and only if the component of the free stream velocity normal to the structural axis is considered in the ip the effects of the axial component of the incident flow are neglected this principle has been used widely due to its practical application but it has a restricted range of validity in this section the validity of ip was examined against the viv experimental results of the yawed flexible cylinder with five yaw angles presented above as shown in fig 8 the strouhal number of the yawed flexible cylinder with yaw angles of 15 and 30 agree very well with that for the normal incidence cylinder as the yaw angle is larger than 30 the strouhal number reaches its peak value for a 45 then decreases to its minimum value for a 60 this means that the strouhal number follows the ip for yaw angles less than 30 as presented in fig 11 there is no evident difference among the peak values of the maximum rms amplitudes of the flexible cylinder when a 30 these results indicate that the ip could be used to predict viv displacement amplitude of a flexible cylinder for yawed angle up to 30 however based on the comparison of multi mode response of normal incidence cylinder with yawed ones in figs 14 17 it can be found there exhibits a similar dynamic response behavior in the yawed and normal incidence cylinder as long as the oncoming flow normal component is used to calculate the reduced velocity for a 30 the differences of multi mode viv response between the yawed cylinder and normal incidence one become more and more obvious as the yaw angle increases from 45 to 60 these results show that the effect of the axial component of the flow is non negligible for yaw angle larger than 45 5 conclusions a series of experimental studies on viv of a yawed flexible cylinder at five different yaw angles a 0 15 30 45 and 60 were conducted in a towing tank the uniform flow was generated by towing the cylinder model with a mass ratio of 1 90 and an aspect ratio of 350 in still water the vibration responses in both cf and il directions were measured by strain gages which evenly distributed along the span wise of the cylinder model the experimental results including dominant frequency and mode of vibration displacement amplitude the time histories of displacement and frequency spectra at measurement points span evolutions of the rms values for the dimensionless displacement etc were presented and discussed several main findings are summarized as follows 1 unlike the viv responses of elastically mounted rigid cylinder in which a large drop was observed in the maximum response amplitude at large yaw angles franzini et al 2013 jain and modarres sadeghi 2013 there is a slight increase in the peak values of the cf and il maximum response amplitude for the viv of the flexible cylinder as the yaw angle increase from 0 to 60 2 the strouhal numbers for five yaw angles are in the range of 0 159 0 171 in present experimental work up to 4 order and 6 order modes are observed in cf and il directions respectively in addition it is found that higher order modes are more easily excited at the same reduced velocity for the case with a large yaw angle 3 the yawed flexible cylinder subjected to viv exhibits typical multi mode response behaviors in both cf and il directions this phenomenon is similar to the numerical result of the viv of a flexible cylinder yawed at 60 from bourguet et al 2015 4 the ip could be applied to investigate the multi mode viv of a yawed flexible cylinder when a 30 and could provide accurate predictions of displacement amplitude strouhal number dominant mode of vibration etc however increasing discrepancies may occur at larger yaw angles a 45 and 60 acknowledgments this work was supported by national natural science foundation of china 51479135 51679167 and 51579175 natural science foundation of tianjin 13jcqnjc07500

23509,laboratory tests were carried out to characterize the multi mode vortex induced vibrations viv of a yawed flexible cylinder in a uniform flow five yaw angles in relation to the direction orthogonal to the oncoming flow were adopted i e a 0 15 30 45 and 60 in this paper in order to simulate the uniform flow the flexible cylinder model with a mass ratio of 1 90 and an aspect ratio of 350 was towed by a carriage with the towing velocity varying from 0 05 m s to 1 0 m s in a towing tank the corresponding reynolds numbers approximately fell in the range of 800 16000 the effects of yaw angle on the multi mode response of the yawed flexible cylinder subjected to viv were investigated and discussed based on the experimental results it can be found that the maximum values of response amplitudes in both cross flow cf and in line il directions show a slight upward trend when the yaw angle increases from 0 to 60 the peak value of strouhal number of the yawed cylinder is about 5 larger than that of the normal incidence one a 0 the multi mode viv response occurs even at a yaw angle as high as 60 in addition particular attention was paid to the validity of the independence principle ip which assumes that the yawed and normal incidence cylinder cases are comparable if only the oncoming flow velocity normal component is applied to scale the physical quantities the experimental results indicate that the ip seems to be a reasonable hypothesis for examining the multi mode viv of a yawed flexible cylinder for a 30 and some discrepancies gradually appear as the yaw angle increases from 45 to 60 keywords yawed flexible cylinder vortex induced vibrations viv independence principle ip yaw angle fluid structure interaction fsi 1 introduction vortex induced vibrations viv of cylindrical structures enduring fluid flows is a ubiquitous and complicated fluid structure interaction fsi phenomenon in offshore engineering this type of oscillation often driven at high frequencies over extended periods of time may lead to severe structural failure of the member due to fatigue damage accumulation much attention has been focused on this canonical fsi

2009b lee and allen 2010 song et al 2011 gao et al 2015 pavlovskaia et al 2016 gedikli and dahl 2017 however the majority of previous investigations on viv of cylinders are the cases where the oncoming flow direction is perpendicular to the span wise axis of the structure in reality the flow direction may be inclined to the structural axis such as viv of mooring lines free spanning pipelines and steel catenary risers when a circular cylinder is not normal to the oncoming flow with a large yaw angle the flow velocity in the axial direction of the structure may not be negligible and vortex shedding from a yawed cylinder is different from that of a normal incidence cylinder in a cross flow in order to better understanding of the effect of cylinder inclination on the flow behaviors a large number of researchers have conducted studies of the flow around yawed fixed cylinders both experimentally in a wind tunnel or water flume ramberg 1983 vlachos and telionis 2008 zhou et al 2009 2010 franzini et al 2014 najafi et al 2016 and numerically lucor and karniadakis 2003 yeo and jones 2008 zhao et al 2009 for yaw angle up to 75 an approach called independence principle ip was proposed to estimate the vortex shedding characteristics of cylinders inclined to the oncoming flow hanson 1966 van atta 1968 the ip suggests that the yawed cylinder can be treated as the normal incidence one if only the component of the free flow velocity normal to the cylinder axis is considered the ip ignores the influence of component of the flow velocity parallel to the cylinder axis which is legit for small yaw angles but not when the yaw angle increases to a large value ramberg 1983 zhao et al 2009 herein the yaw angle a is defined as the angle between the cylinder axis and the direction orthogonal to the oncoming flow compared to the fixed cylinder case a vibration of the cylinder tends to force parallel shedding ramberg 1983 lucor and karniadakis 2003 this further indicates that the ip could be reasonable over a wide range of yaw angles for an elastically mounted rigid cylinder subjected to viv franzini et al 2009 carried out experiments on viv of yawed rigid cylinders elastically mounted on a water tunnel the reynolds numbers were in the range of 2000 8000 and the yaw angles were 0 20 and 45 it was observed that the displacement amplitudes measured fluid forces and added mass partially agreed with the results of a normal incidence cylinder oscillating in cf direction franzini et al 2013 performed 1 dof degree of freedom and 2 dof viv experiments of yawed cylinders to investigate the validity of the ip for properly describing the flow characteristics and the oscillation of structures subjected to oblique flow five yaw angles a 0 10 20 30 and 45 in both upstream and downstream orientations were tested it was found that the displacement amplitude showed reasonably good agreement with that of normal incidence ones for yaw angles up to 20 while for yaw angles larger than 20 a decrease in the maximum amplitude was observed jain and modarres sadeghi 2013 conducted a series of experiments on an elastically mounted rigid cylinder placed into an oncoming flow with various yaw angles a 0 75 it was illustrated that the ip was qualitatively valid for the yaw angles of 0 20 45 and 55 but failed with larger ones a 65 and 75 zhao 2015 numerically investigated the viv of an elastically mounted rigid cylinder with a yaw angle of 45 to check the validity of the ip it was shown that the displacement amplitudes and vibration frequencies of the yawed cylinder agreed very well with those of a normal incidence one despite the numerous investigations regarding the viv of an elastically mounted yawed rigid cylinder the problem of oscillation of a yawed flexible cylinder placed in a free stream has received much less attention king 1977 experimentally investigated the self excited oscillations of a yawed flexible cylinder for reynolds number in the range 2000 20000 and for yaw angles 45 a 45 it was observed that the ip could reasonably predict the upper and lower limits of the reduced velocity region in which the lock in phenomenon occurred with only a slight decrease in the maximum amplitude bourguet et al 2015 studied the viv of a flexible cylinder with a yaw angle of 60 an aspect ratio of 50 and the reynolds number of 500 by using dns method particular attention was paid to the validity of the ip it was pointed out that the ip was valid in the cases with a high axial tension in contrast the behaviors of the fluid structure system clearly deviated from the ip when the axial tension was low bourguet and triantafyllou 2015 further numerically investigated the viv of a flexible cylinder with a very large yaw angle of 80 comparison of the vibration responses and fluid forces between the yawed and normal incidence cylinder configurations showed that the behaviors of the fluid structure system drastically departed from the ip recently seyed aghazadeh et al 2015 performed an experimental investigation on the cf viv of a curved flexible cylinder in the convex and concave orientations with a reynolds number range of re 300 2300 it was found the displacement amplitude in both configurations was decreased compared to a normal incidence straight cylinder with the same mass ratio in addition the higher harmonic components both the second and the third harmonic components were observed in flow forces acting on the curved cylinder more recently zhu et al 2016 conducted experimental studies of a curved flexible pipe with an aspect ratio of 108 in a shear flow the curved pipe was fully immersed in a re circulating water channel and the maximum reynolds number was 1129 it was found that different vibration frequencies exist at different positions of the pipe with the presentation of multi mode response and eight shape trajectories appear in the middle part of the pipe while the trajectories evolve to half moon format at the two ends of the pipe han et al 2017 performed a towing tank experiment of viv of an inclined flexible cylinder with a 45 to investigate the response characteristics it was observed that the cf response amplitude could be up to a value of 3 0d and the il one more than 1 1d as mentioned above while much work has been done on viv of yawed elastically mounted cylinders in a flow little attention has been paid to viv of a yawed flexible cylinder in particular long flexible cylinders used in offshore engineerings such as marine risers and cables may exhibit multi mode viv when exposed to fluid flows such vibrations can be of serious consequence as they provide a potent source of fatigue this paper experimentally studied the viv of a yawed flexible cylinder with yaw angle varying from 0 to 60 with an increment of 15 the aspect ratio of the flexible cylinder was 350 the mass ratio was 1 90 and the reynolds number ranged from 800 to 16000 the main aim is to investigate the effects of yaw angle on the multi mode response of the yawed flexible cylinder with high aspect ratio and low mass ratio undergoing vortex shedding and produce a new dataset which hopefully will stimulate new experiments and more numerical studies another purpose is to check the validity of the ip applied to the viv of a yawed flexible cylinder based on present experimental results the organization of the paper is as follows section 2 describes the details of the experimental set up the methods for strain signals pre processing and displacement response reconstruction are introduced in section 3 section 4 presents and discusses the experimental results of viv of the yawed flexible cylinder with five yaw angles finally several important conclusions are listed 2 experimental arrangement the laboratory experiment was carried out in a 137 0 m 7 0 m 3 3 m length width depth towing tank at the state key laboratory of hydraulic engineering simulation and safety tianjin university the test apparatus had several principal parts including a supporting structure two vertical supporting units a flexible cylinder model and an axial tension system the sketch of the test apparatus is shown in fig 1 several vertical and horizontal steel beams consisted of the supporting structure while the vertical supporting unit was composed of an angle plate a vertical supporting rod a supporting plate and a guide plate the vertical supporting rod was joined with the supporting plate at the bottom end and the angle plate at the top end the angle plate as illustrated in fig 2 was used to change the yaw angle of the cylinder in relation to the direction perpendicular to the carriage motion five yaw angles were tested namely a 0 15 30 45 and 60 aiming to eliminate the disturbing flow generated by the supporting plates and supporting rods two guide plates were installed on the supporting plates by using several long bolts in the experiment these guide plates were rotated to be parallel to the oncoming flow two reinforcing rods were connected to the supporting structure and the vertical supporting rods in order to withstand the loads during the tests a universal joint was used to connect one end of the cylinder model with one supporting plate and a steel wire was connected to the flexible cylinder at the other end the steel wire passed through small holes in the guide and supporting plates on one end and was connected to a spring at the other end the spring was used to adjust a gradual variation of axial tension on the cylinder model during the tests the tensioner was adjusted keeping the axial tension in all tests equaled to 300 n a load cell was adopted to measure the axial tension on the vibrating flexible cylinder a pulley which was attached to one supporting plate was employed to realize the direction change of steel wire the flexible cylinder model as shown in fig 3 was a coaxial composite tube with a length of 5 6 m the inner part was made of a copper pipe with an outer diameter of 8 0 mm and a wall thickness of 1 0 mm the outer part was made of a silicone tube with an outer diameter d of 16 0 mm and a wall thickness of 4 0 mm the mass per unit length m s of the cylinder model including the mass of the measuring instruments was 0 3821 kg m resulting in a dimensionless mass ratio m 4m s ρπd 2 of 1 90 where ρ is the water density the bending stiffness ei and axial stiffness ea of the cylinder model were 17 45 nm2 and 2 793 106 n respectively where e was young s modulus of copper i was the moment of inertia of the inner copper pipe and a was the cross section area of the inner copper pipe because the outer silicone tube is soft its contribution to the bending stiffness and axial stiffness could be neglected the axial tension was directly employed on the inner copper pipe fourteen pairs of strain gages were attached to outer surface of the copper pipe seven of those were oriented in the x direction in line il while the others were in the y direction cross flow cf the measurement points were evenly distributed along the cylinder model as illustrated in fig 3a a cross section view of the cylinder model is shown in fig 3b the aspect ratio length diameter of the cylinder model was 350 in addition the outer silicone tube could provide a smooth external surface and protect the measuring instrumentation the key parameters of the cylinder model are listed in table 1 the cylinder model was submerged in still water and 1 0 m from the free surface to eliminate the free surface effects the test schematics is illustrated in fig 4 the uniform flow was generated by towing the cylinder model along the tank in still water from 0 05 m s to 1 0 m s with an interval of 0 05 m s and the reynolds number was in the range of 800 16000 each experimental run lasted for 50s with the first portion containing transients ignored more than 100 oscillation cycles in cf direction could be obtained during the sample time of each run the interval between two consecutive runs was at least 15 min a total of 100 runs were performed the sampling frequency of the measuring instruments was 100 hz which was sufficient to avoid aliasing problems 3 data analysis 3 1 definition of reduced velocity in this paper the reduced velocity is defined as 1 v r u cos α f 1 d where u is the towing carriage velocity f 1 is the fundamental frequency 1st mode frequency of the cylinder in still water calculated from 2 f n n 2 l t m n π l 2 e i m where f n is the nth order eigenfrequency of the cylinder n is the order of mode m is the total mass including structural mass m s and added mass m a ρπd 2 4 the reduced velocity v r range extended to a maximum value of 30 64 for the tested cases 3 2 measured strain signals pre processing a pretension of 300 n was applied to the axis of the flexible cylinder for all test cases g1 g7 represent the measurement locations of the strain gages see fig 3a the il strain contains three parts a tensile strain caused by axial pretension a bending strain caused by mean drag force and a viv induced bending strain according to the assumptions that the time averaged bending strain caused by viv is zero and the time averaged tensile strain caused by axial pretension and time averaged bending strain caused by mean drag force are temporally invariant the il viv bending strain can be calculated by subtracting the time averaged values from the strain data the cf viv bending strain can be computed using a similar method except that the cf strain signal includes only two parts i e a tensile strain caused by axial pretension and a viv induced bending strain this method was extensively used in many experimental studies song et al 2011 2016 gao et al 2015 then the bending strain was high pass filtered with a cutoff of 1 0 hz to eliminate the low frequency noise caused by the carriage motion and supporting structure vibration moreover the bending strain was further low pass filtered with a cutoff of 40 0 hz to remove the high frequency electromagnetic noise fig 5 shows an example of the signal processing and band pass filtering of the il strain signal measured at g4 with a 30 and v r 13 27 the top sub plot shows the original strain signal the middle one presents the viv bending strain by removing the strain caused by axial pretension and mean drag the bottom sub plot shows the band pass filtered viv bending strain together with the unfiltered signal it can be clearly observed that the bending strain is smoothed and some unwanted frequency components are eliminated the test runs in the experiment were generally carried out once due to the large test matrix more than 100 runs investigated however to check the system sensitivity and consistency the test runs with particular yaw angle case a 15 were repeated three times and the results of maximum rms strain in cf and il directions are shown in fig 6 it can be observed that the maximum relative error is smaller than 10 which indicates that the experimental results of strain are reliable and consistent 3 3 displacement response reconstruction the modal analysis introduced in lie and kaasen 2006 was used to reconstruct viv displacement response of the cylinder this method has been successfully applied in the reconstruction of viv of flexible cylinders using the strain or acceleration signals measured at limited sampling points trim et al 2005 lie and kaasen 2006 song et al 2011 gao et al 2015 base on the linear decomposition hypothesis the time varying viv displacement response of a cylinder can be taken as the sum of a series of modal components taking the reconstruction of cf viv displacement as an example the response can be expressed as 3 y z t n 1 φ n z w n t where y z t is the cf displacement z is the coordinate along the axis of the cylinder t is time φ n z is the modal shape w n t is the modal weight and n is the order of vibration mode the pretension cylinder can be simplified as a bernoulli euler beam with pined pined boundary conditions the modal shape of displacement can be written as 4 φ n z sin π n z l where l is the cylinder length the relationship between curvature and strain is 5 ε z t r n 1 π n l 2 sin π n z l w n t where r is the outer radius of the copper pipe in eq 5 only modal weight w n t is unknown and can be calculated using the filtered viv bending strain signals fig 7 shows a typical example of modal analysis technique used in this paper to reconstruct the viv displacement response of the flexible cylinder with a 15 and v r 11 84 it can be found that the first three modes are significantly excited and the 2nd mode dominates the maximum displacement amplitude is obtained at g2 with a peak value larger than 2 0d 4 results and discussion in this section the experimental results for the natural frequencies in still water dominant frequency and dominant mode maximum displacement amplitude time series and frequency response of displacement as well as comparison of multi mode response of normal incidence a 0 cylinder with yawed one at different yaw angles a 15 30 45 and 60 are presented and discussed 4 1 natural frequencies in still water because the natural frequency is very important for the experimental setup and results in analysis first free decaying tests of the cylinder model in still water were performed to obtain the natural frequencies of the flexible cylinder at all five yaw angle cases a hammer was applied to hit the middle point of the flexible cylinder to excite vibrations in cf and il directions respectively the natural frequency of the cylinder in water was obtained by using a fast fourier transform fft to the time history of the strain at the measurement point g4 table 2 lists the natural frequencies of the cylinder model in still water the first 7 mode frequencies of the cylinder model were compared with the analytical values estimated by eq 2 it should be noted the measured value of the first natural frequency is a slight difference among the cases with different yaw angles hence the reduced velocity was calculated by using the analytical frequency value from eq 2 another purpose of free decaying tests was to evaluate the performance of strain gages used in present experimental study it can be found that the experimental data agree quite well with the analytical values with an error less than 6 which could provide strong evidence of the high accuracy of the measurement instruments also it could prove that the whole experimental system featured with varying yaw angle of the cylinder is reliable 4 2 dominant frequencies and dominant modes fig 8 illustrates the dimensionless dominant frequencies f f 1 in cf and il directions versus the reduced velocity it should be pointed out that f 1 is the theoretical value of the first natural frequency calculated by eq 2 the dominant frequency f was taken as the largest peak in the spectra plot obtained by using the fft of the time varying displacement linear fits to the cf frequencies using the least square method were also superimposed on the plots together with lines with doubled slopes it can be observed that the dominant frequencies of the il and cf displacement responses roughly follow a doubled relationship for the cases with different yaw angles the slope of the cf fitting lines i e the strouhal number defined as st f s d ucosa where f s is the vortex shedding frequency it is nearly same as the dominant frequency of cf viv f y in the lock in region ranges from 0 159 to 0 171 the strouhal number is 0 163 for the cases with a 0 and 15 gradually increases to 0 164 at a 30 and 0 171 at a 45 then sharply drops to 0 159 at a 60 the peak value of strouhal number is approximately 5 larger than that of the normal incidence cylinder in order to further investigate the effect of yaw angle on the strouhal number fig 9 shows the ratios between st and st 0 where st 0 is the strouhal number at a 0 for comparison the strouhal numbers of yawed fixed rigid cylinders placed into an oncoming flow from previous numerical simulations zhao et al 2009 and experimental studies van atta 1968 ramberg 1983 zhou et al 2009 najafi et al 2016 are also drawn in fig 9 present experimental data show good agreement with those of previous numerical and experimental results when the yaw angle is not larger than 30 the strouhal number in the present experiment is slightly smaller than the empirically fitted curve of van atta 1968 when the yaw angle is up to 45 as the yaw angle increases from 45 to 60 all these previous experimental data show a gradually increasing trend except the numerical results of zhao et al 2009 and present experimental data in which a mild decreasing trend can be observed there is also obvious difference during present experimental results previous experimental data van atta 1968 ramberg 1983 zhou et al 2009 najafi et al 2016 and numerical simulation results zhao et al 2009 when the yaw angle is in the range of 45o 60 the discrepancies among these data might be attributed to the flow quality end effects aspect ratio and reynolds number etc najafi et al 2016 fig 10 presents the cf and il dominant modes of vibration versus the reduced velocity at five yaw angle cases it should point out that the dominant mode is the mode which has the largest modal weight from eq 5 the maximum dominant mode is 4 order for a 0 and 15 3 order for a 30 and 45 and 2 order for a 60 in cf direction while 6 order as a 30 5 order for a 45 and 4 order for a 60 in il direction it can be seen from fig 10 that the dominant mode shows a staircase like shape upon closer inspection it can be found that higher order modes in cf direction are more easily excited at the same reduced velocity for the case with a larger yaw angle e g when vr 9 2 and 19 9 a similar trend also can be observed in il direction 4 3 displacement amplitude fig 11 shows the maxima of root mean square rms dimensionless amplitude in cf and il directions versus the reduced velocity note that the mean deformation of the flexible cylinder was subtracted from the il displacement data when the yaw angle is 0 15 30 45 and 60 the peak value of maximum rms dimensionless displacement is approximately 1 43d 1 48d 1 51d 1 55d and 1 62d in cf direction and 0 41d 0 41d 0 50d 0 51d and 0 51d in il direction these results indicate there is a slight upward trend for the peak value of the maximum rms displacement with the increase of yaw angle this is different from the experimental results of viv of an elastically mounted yawed rigid cylinder of franzini et al 2013 and jain and modarres sadeghi 2013 in which the amplitude response significantly decreases when the yaw angle is larger than 20 this discrepancy could be caused by the use of a rigid cylinder instead of a flexible cylinder in their experiments another possible reason can be attributed to the asymmetric boundary conditions adopted in their experimental set up a yawed cylinder which pierced the free surface of the oncoming flow was partially submerged in the water in their experimental investigations the free end of the cylinder and free surface of the flow affects vortex shedding in addition it can be found from fig 11 that the maximum amplitude of the yawed flexible cylinder is achieved at a lower reduced velocity with increasing yaw angle it should be noticed that there are several obvious drops in the maximum rms amplitude e g v r 9 0 and 17 5 this drop could be contributed to the switching of the mode of vibration of the cylinder model compared to the cf amplitudes the rms il amplitudes show similar but more scattered results which could be attributed to the higher mode of vibration 4 4 time series and frequency response of displacement for further examining the typical displacement response and vibration frequency spectra of a yawed flexible cylinder with varying yaw angle in the mode transition region figs 12 and 13 give the time histories of displacement and frequency spectra at seven measurement points in cf and il directions the top sub plot shows the time varying displacement for the time range of 20 40s and the bottom sub plot gives the displacement response spectra which were produced by fft analysis of the displacement data and the first to fifth columns are corresponding to five yaw angle cases a 0 15 30 45 and 60 respectively in the figures it can be seen in figs 12 and 13 that displacement amplitude varies at different measurement points the sampling locations with larger amplitudes are close to the positions of mode antinode while the smaller values of amplitude are near the node of the dominant mode taking il vibration with a 15 and v r 8 88 for example the 4th mode is excited see fig 10 for this case and the measurement positions g1 g3 g5 and g7 close to the antinode while g2 g4 and g6 are corresponding to the positions of mode nodes moreover it can be observed that the viv responses in both cf and il directions consisted of one or two strong frequency peaks and a few very weak frequency peaks a similar phenomenon has been found in the experimental investigations on viv of the normal incidence and curved flexible cylinder in uniform and shear flows xu et al 2009 zhu et al 2016 these results indicate that multi mode viv response apparently occurs in present experimental work especially in il direction in addition it can be clearly seen that the time varying displacements and response frequencies at measurement points are nearly the same for a 0 15 and 30 in both cf and il directions the maximum displacement amplitudes in the cf and il directions are up to 1 0d and 0 5d respectively when yaw angle is larger than 45 in figs 12e and 13e the flexible cylinder yawed at 60 still exhibits regular cf and il viv a similar trend has been observed by bourguet et al 2015 in the numerical studies of viv of a yawed flexible cylinder with a 60 and re 500 and more strong frequency peaks are found in the frequency spectra plots especially in il direction as the yaw angle increases from 45 to 60 in the present experimental work 4 5 multi mode viv response of the yawed flexible cylinder in the following section figs 14 17 are drawn to investigate the multi mode viv characteristics of the yawed flexible cylinder and compare the multi mode response of the normal incidence cylinder a 0 with the yawed ones a 15 30 45 and 60 respectively these figures have the same configuration the first column graph presents space time varying cf and il displacement contour in a time interval from 32 to 33s the second column graph shows the spanwise evolutions of the rms values for the dimensionless cf and il displacement the third column graph illustrates the time histories of cf and il displacement at seven measurement points in a time interval from 30 to 35s for describing the characteristics of response clearly the final column graph gives the response trajectories at seven measurement points g1 g7 fig 14 presents the results of the comparison of the yawed flexible cylinder with a 15 and v r 29 11 with the normal incidence one at v r 29 59 it can be observed the vibrations exhibit similar behaviors such as the 4 order oscillation is dominant in cf direction while 6 order in il direction the maximum cf and il rms displacements are nearly 1 1d and 0 4d respectively the rms displacements in cf and il directions are obviously not close to zero which indicates that the overall viv response is a combination of standing wave and traveling wave behavior however it is still dominated by the standing wave in both cf and il directions in addition it is clearly seen most of the response trajectories at measurement points are the eight shape figure which is induced by that the il dominant oscillation frequency is twice that cf fig 15 shows the multi mode viv responses of the yawed flexible cylinder with a 30 and v r 19 91 compared with the normal incidence one at v r 19 90 it can be found that slightly different vibration behaviors exist the cf and il dominant modes are 2 order and 4 order for a 0 while 3 order and 5 order for a 30 the peak values of cf and il rms displacement for a 0 are both slightly larger than that of a 30 the combination of standing wave and traveling wave consists of the overall viv response in cf and il directions for both a 0 and a 30 motion trajectories at measurement points for a 0 are apparently different with that of a 30 as shown in fig 16 there is an obvious distinction between the viv for the normal incidence cylinder and cylinder yawed at a 45 for a 0 the dominant modes are 2nd and 4th in cf and il directions respectively and the maximum cf and il rms displacements are 1 3d and 0 3d the motion trajectories at measurement points for a 0 is slightly irregular for a 45 3 order mode dominates both cf and il viv the peak values of cf and il rms displacements are about 1 0d and 0 4d it is observed that the trajectories are ellipses format at measurement positions which could be attributed that the dominant oscillation frequency in il direction is nearly the same as that in cf direction as the yaw angle increases to 60 it can be found the dynamic responses of the yawed cylinder subjected to viv are partly inconsistent with those of the normal incidence one at the same reduced velocity in fig 17 the cf and il responses are dominated by 2nd mode and 4th mode for both a 0 and 60 compared with the normal incidence case the maximum rms il displacement of the yawed cylinder is about two times larger however the maxima of rms cf displacements for a 0 is nearly same with that of a 60 in addition both the normal incidence and yawed flexible cylinder vibrations have no stable motion trajectories as shown in fig 17 due to that the cf and il vibrations exhibit several modal frequencies which result in no stable phase differences of the vibrations between two directions 4 6 validity of ip applied to the viv of a yawed flexible cylinder the ip assumes that the responses including displacement amplitude vibration frequency mode of vibration for a flexible cylinder etc of an inclined cylinder undergoing vortex induced vibration are similar to those of a cylinder in normal incident flow if and only if the component of the free stream velocity normal to the structural axis is considered in the ip the effects of the axial component of the incident flow are neglected this principle has been used widely due to its practical application but it has a restricted range of validity in this section the validity of ip was examined against the viv experimental results of the yawed flexible cylinder with five yaw angles presented above as shown in fig 8 the strouhal number of the yawed flexible cylinder with yaw angles of 15 and 30 agree very well with that for the normal incidence cylinder as the yaw angle is larger than 30 the strouhal number reaches its peak value for a 45 then decreases to its minimum value for a 60 this means that the strouhal number follows the ip for yaw angles less than 30 as presented in fig 11 there is no evident difference among the peak values of the maximum rms amplitudes of the flexible cylinder when a 30 these results indicate that the ip could be used to predict viv displacement amplitude of a flexible cylinder for yawed angle up to 30 however based on the comparison of multi mode response of normal incidence cylinder with yawed ones in figs 14 17 it can be found there exhibits a similar dynamic response behavior in the yawed and normal incidence cylinder as long as the oncoming flow normal component is used to calculate the reduced velocity for a 30 the differences of multi mode viv response between the yawed cylinder and normal incidence one become more and more obvious as the yaw angle increases from 45 to 60 these results show that the effect of the axial component of the flow is non negligible for yaw angle larger than 45 5 conclusions a series of experimental studies on viv of a yawed flexible cylinder at five different yaw angles a 0 15 30 45 and 60 were conducted in a towing tank the uniform flow was generated by towing the cylinder model with a mass ratio of 1 90 and an aspect ratio of 350 in still water the vibration responses in both cf and il directions were measured by strain gages which evenly distributed along the span wise of the cylinder model the experimental results including dominant frequency and mode of vibration displacement amplitude the time histories of displacement and frequency spectra at measurement points span evolutions of the rms values for the dimensionless displacement etc were presented and discussed several main findings are summarized as follows 1 unlike the viv responses of elastically mounted rigid cylinder in which a large drop was observed in the maximum response amplitude at large yaw angles franzini et al 2013 jain and modarres sadeghi 2013 there is a slight increase in the peak values of the cf and il maximum response amplitude for the viv of the flexible cylinder as the yaw angle increase from 0 to 60 2 the strouhal numbers for five yaw angles are in the range of 0 159 0 171 in present experimental work up to 4 order and 6 order modes are observed in cf and il directions respectively in addition it is found that higher order modes are more easily excited at the same reduced velocity for the case with a large yaw angle 3 the yawed flexible cylinder subjected to viv exhibits typical multi mode response behaviors in both cf and il directions this phenomenon is similar to the numerical result of the viv of a flexible cylinder yawed at 60 from bourguet et al 2015 4 the ip could be applied to investigate the multi mode viv of a yawed flexible cylinder when a 30 and could provide accurate predictions of displacement amplitude strouhal number dominant mode of vibration etc however increasing discrepancies may occur at larger yaw angles a 45 and 60 acknowledgments this work was supported by national natural science foundation of china 51479135 51679167 and 51579175 natural science foundation of tianjin 13jcqnjc07500
