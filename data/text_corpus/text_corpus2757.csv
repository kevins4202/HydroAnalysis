13785,the removals of organic micro pollutants omps including phenolic compounds and phthalic acid esters from landfill leachate in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland cw with typha sp were investigated over 3 years under no plant harvesting condition the mass removal efficiencies of omps were found increasing with operation time and averaged at 58 73 as cw media became matured highest removals 73 were observed for hydrophilic compounds dep and dbp followed by moderate hydrophobic compounds 2 6 dtbp and bht whereas more hydrophobic compound dehp was lowest removed 58 higher omp removals were observed in the summer season when their influent concentrations became elevated hydrophilic dep and dbp compounds were mainly removed through biodegradation dehp was initially removed through adsorption but subsequently biodegraded in the long term therefore its accumulation in media was kept at low level i e 10 of maximum adsorption capacity during 3 years operation microbial community analyses reveal the presence of sphingomonas sp and rhodococcus sp as predominant microorganisms responsible for the biodegradation of omps this study shows an evidence for sustainable application of cw to the treatment of landfill leachate containing omps in the tropical climate keywords constructed wetland landfill leachate phthalic acid esters phenolic compounds tropical climate 1 introduction municipal landfill leachate is concentrated liquid generated during the disposal of municipal solid wastes msw major pollutants containing in landfill leachate are being regulated in most countries but even properly treated leachate may still pose an adverse impact to ecosystems from organic micro pollutants omps major omps detected in municipal landfill leachate include phthalic acid ester paes or phthalates i e diethyl phthalate dep dibutyl phthalate dbp bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp and phenolic compounds 2 6 di tert butylphenol 2 6 dtbp 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol bht 4 tert butylphenol 4 bp and bisphenol a bpa 1 3 they are mostly used as plasticizers to make plastic material more flexible and also used as antioxidants in foods and cosmetic preparations the removals of these compounds are generally varied widely depending on the type of treatment processes thus provided a different degree of ecological risk in the environment 4 their residuals could pose problems due to their adverse effects on human health and ecological safety when releasing into the natural environment 5 6 constructed wetlands cws are considered as cost effective and environmental friendly technology with high pollutant removal efficiencies cws are suitably applied to wastewater treatment in tropical climate because of warm temperatures steady solar energy flux high humidity conductive plant growth and heightened microbial activities 7 despite having several beneficial effects the operation of cws in tropical climate is facing other challenges such as variation of treatment performance between seasons thus cws may not be relied upon if its effluent qualities must meet stringent discharge standards at all times especially when the system has not yet reached stable condition moreover increased hydraulic flow anticipated during high intensity rainfall events during rainy seasons may result in solid clogging or periodical washout of accumulated solids from media generally cws can be classified into different types according to the water flow regime as a free water surface fws and subsurface flow cws ssf ssf cws can be further categorized into the horizontal subsurface flow hssf and vertical subsurface flow vsf cws the average removal efficiencies of fws were reported to be lower than those in other types of cws for all pollutants especially nutrients as compared to hssf and vsf various treatment mechanisms available within hssf and vsf cws helped to improve the removal efficiencies of pollutants 7 hssf cws are generally continuously fed with wastewater and therefore the filtration is carried out majorly in anaerobic or anoxic condition whereas the aerobic condition prevails only adjacent to plant root zone 8 vsf cws are fed intermittently and allow for oxygen diffusion into the filtration bed once the bed is emptied after the water percolated to the bottom therefore vsf cws have higher oxygen transfer capacity comparing to hssf cws thus resulting in better removal of ammonia under enhanced nitrification conditions 7 9 nevertheless they are prone to clogging with higher cost associations 10 generally hssf is a popular applied to the treatment of high organic strength wastewater including landfill leachate 8 9 with moderate organic removals 60 8 78 7 in terms of bod was reported over short term study 11 long term investigation 7 years using a combination of vsf and hssf units provided average bod removals of 59 during which the treatment performance was found significantly varied with precipitation but not with temperature 12 hssf cw with vetiver grass has also shown promising results when applied as pretreatment of highly contaminated composting leachate 10 nevertheless the degree of leachate stabilization also influenced the treatment performance of cws being more effective for fresh rather than partially stabilized leachate 13 moreover a significant reduction in leachate volume during the cw treatment was also reported 14 these positive results obtained from field studies suggested the applicability of cw technologies for reducing organic pollution at landfill sites nevertheless the treatment capacities of cws in the treatment and removal of omps presented in landfill leachate has not been fully explored most of the previous researches were carried in a short term study under a controlled environment using low strength wastewater such as municipal wastewater or domestic sewage in which moderate to high removals of hydrophilic phenolic compounds and paes such as bpa dbp and dep in vsf cw from biodegradation mechanism under aerobic condition were reported 15 19 it was also found that the presence of omps could stimulate the release of enzymes at plant rhizosphere to enhance the pollutant removals 16 comparatively lower removals of omps were reported in hssf cws than those observed in vsf 20 21 they were rarely removed in hssf cw especially under high loading conditions 22 the presence of the anaerobic condition nonetheless helped remove hydrophobic omps through adsorption and sedimentation mechanisms 23 moreover micro environments developed in the plant rhizosphere of hssf cw could also promote the removals of phenolic compounds i e bpa np 24 so far there is very limited information on omp removals in hssf operated under high organic loading in long term operation only laboratory scale vsf cw treating synthetic landfill leachate was reported to remove bpa well under short term operation at high influent concentration 25 therefore this research was carried out to elucidate the removal efficiencies of omps phenolic compounds 2 6 dtbp bht and phthalates dep dbp dehp in hssf using real landfill leachate operated under field condition of tropical climate over a long term period of 3 years to our knowledge this is the first field attempt to evaluate the long term removal of omps from landfill leachate in hssf cw operated under seasonal variations in the tropical climate the obtained information would be useful for the practical design of the cw treatment system to minimize the ecotoxicological impact of msw landfill operation on the natural water environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment a hssf cw unit 1 0 m width 2 0 m length 1 0 m depth made of concrete was installed at a municipal landfill in thailand the media zone 1 0 m width 1 6 m length 0 65 m depth was filled with sand media of 0 02 2 mm size porosity of 0 39 whereas the inlet and outlet zones 0 2 m length each were filled with 50 mm and 10 mm sized gravels respectively the unit was operated at a water depth was 0 55 m typha sp was planted in the cw unit with an initial density of 12 stems m2 raw leachate obtained from storage ponds in the landfill site was fed to the system at a constant flow rate of 80 l d equivalent to hydraulic loading rate hlr of 0 04 m3 m2 d table 1 shows the influent characteristics of landfill leachate during the operation period the omp concentrations detected in feeding landfill leachate during the operation period were 87 182 μg l for dep 257 786 μg l for dbp 207 480 μg l for 2 6 dtbp 248 553 μg l for bht and 748 3769 μg l for dehp respectively the cw performance was monitored from jul 2015 to may 2018 for a total period of 34 months during the operation hydraulic retention time hrt in the cw unit was varied between 5 8 to 6 9 days depending on the actual inflow feed leachate plus precipitation and outflow rates of the unit the allocation of the seasonal period was performed following the thai

the media samples were also collected at different depths 0 20 20 40 40 60 cm for mass balance determination media samples were freeze dried and homogenized by sieving through a stainless steel 60 mesh sieve after removing stones and residual roots and stored in aluminum foil bags at 20 c until extraction plant separated above ground including stem and leaves and roots fresh plant samples washed with tap water and rinsed with distilled water and wiped dry with paper tissue before freeze dried then plant samples to storage at 20 c refrigerated until extraction for each sample extraction 10 g media and plant samples were extracted then samples water media and plant were analyzed omps with gc ms shimadzu gc ms qp2010 plus 2 3 omp adsorption and biodegradation capacities of cw media media samples were collected at the plant root zone 0 20 cm depth from media surface on day 141 1st year and day 785 3rd year and subject to batch experiments for determination of omp adsorption and biodegradation capacities all batch experiments were performed using 1 g media in 100 ml volume of the synthetic solution containing initial individual omp concentration of 5 000 μg l under shaking condition 200 rpm at room temperature 30 2 c the samples were taken for analysis at different times during 6 days similar to hrt of cw then subjected to centrifugation 7 000 rpm 10 min and the supernatant was used for omps analyses omp removals were calculated from the difference between the initial concentration and the final equilibrium concentration in the aqueous phase to distinguish between the removals through adsorption and biodegradation of omps in media samples batch experiments were performed to quantify adsorptive removal using inactive triplicated autoclaved at 121 c media and combined adsorption and biodegradation removals using active samples 2 4 microbial community analysis the microbial communities in cw media sampled at the plant root zone 0 20 cm depth at mid depth were analyzed on day 216 1st year and day 1031 days 3rd year by pcr dgge technique the 338gc f 518r primer was used to identify most of the bacteria species the pcr conditions were set as follows initial denaturation 95 c for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 95 c for 30 s 60 c for 10 s and 72 c for 25 s and a final extension at 72 c for 7 min for dgge analysis the samples containing equal amounts of pcr products were loaded onto 7 5 wt vol polyacrylamide gels in 1x tae buffer with a denaturing gradient ranging from 45 to 65 denaturants for the sample of day 216 and 43 to 68 denaturant gradients for the sample of day 1031 electrophoresis was performed at 60 c for 16 h at a constant voltage of 80 v following electrophoresis the gel was stained with sybr gold nucleic acid stain invitrogen usa for 30 min the images were visualized on a uv transilluminator and captured using biovision cn 1000 26 m vilber lourmat france the target dgge bands were excised resuspended in 20 μl of milliq water and stored at 4 c overnight the dna fragments recovered from the gel were used as templates for reamplification using primer set without gc clamp the amplified pcr products were purified sequenced and compared to known 16s rrna sequences in the genbank database using blast software 2 5 data analysis the pollutant removal efficiencies in the cw were calculated based on the mass removal efficiency mre as described in the following equation 1 m r e c 0 q 0 c i q i c 0 q 0 x 100 where c0 ci is influent and effluent pollutant concentrations and q0 qi is the influent and effluent flow rates respectively the translocation factor tf of omps in the cw was calculated using the following equation 2 t f c s h o o t c r o o t where cshoot and croot are omps contents in plant shoot and root respectively to determine the degree of microbial biodiversity the shannon weaver s index h describing species richness was determined by the following equation 3 h n i n i x log 2 n i n i where n i is the intensity of the band for each microbial species on the dgge fingerprint the statistical analysis was carried out using microsoft excel to obtain averages and standard deviations of concentrations of target contaminants one way anova was used to evaluate the statistical significance of the mre difference between seasons and operating years using spss version 22 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 environmental condition during the operation period the monthly mean temperature varied between 27 4 32 1 c total precipitation was 831 1350 and 1368 mm during the 1st 2nd and 3rd year of operation being highest in september at 218 5 in 15 days 358 5 in 23 days mm during the 1st and 2nd year and in october at 193 8 mm in 10 days during the 3rd year the relative humidity ranged between 64 83 along the operation years the observed amount of water lost through evapotranspiration et in the cw unit accounted for 34 3 45 1 and 41 1 of inflow water respectively they were recorded highest in april summer at 53 0 57 5 but the difference of et between seasons diminished in the latter years after the plant in the cw unit has been well developed in this study the cw unit with typha sp was operated without any plant harvesting the average plant heights of 1 04 1 57 cm 1 97 m and green shoot densities of 41 54 56 no m2 were recorded during the 3 years operation the growth of the plant in terms of plant height was observed during the 1st year of operation afterward the green and dried shoot numbers were found to fluctuate seasonally during the operating period the plant growth was found higher during the rainy season then the number of shoots and height dropped in winter and plant shoot became dried in summer but their heights were mostly maintained as a result biomass densities in the cw unit increased from 81 to 4878 g m2 with average root length increased from 5 cm to 13 cm this succession of plant growth would also influence et 29 30 as well as microbial communities 31 in the cw unit 3 2 treatment performance of hssf cw table 1 shows influent concentrations and mre of organic and nitrogen pollutants in different seasons during the operation the landfill leachate used in this study was partially stabilized in nature exhibiting in terms of alkaline ph 8 9 10 6 with low bod cod of 0 15 after cw treatment the effluent ph was slightly lowered to 8 4 due to acid formation during organic degradation and nitrification reaction meanwhile ec was found in the range between 8 2 10 1 ms cm possibly from the complex ions in landfill leachate 32 during the treatment mre of ec was found significantly increasing from 14 3 and 22 1 during the first 2 years to 42 6 during the 3rd years the precipitation of inorganic salts in the cw media resulted in an increased ec content in the media nevertheless there was no significant seasonal effect on mre of ec the influent bod and cod concentrations were not significantly varied among the seasons and operation years they were averaged at 147 9 and 1013 mg l respectively after the treatment the lowest average effluent bod and cod concentrations were observed in the summer season of the 3rd year at 48 3 mg l and 329 mg l during the operation mre of organic pollutants was increasing with operation time being 57 4 66 9 74 6 for bod and 51 1 67 5 76 9 for cod in the 1st 2nd and 3rd years respectively the improvement of organic removals was possibly contributed due to its deposition in the media and the development of microbial degradation through the attached biofilm on the media 9 32 the biodegradation of organic substances was also supported by the availability of oxygen through plant root transfer which increased the yearly average do level in rhizosphere from 1 2 mg l in the 1st year to 2 1 mg l in the 3rd year thus the plants only acted as a support media for microbial attachment while transferring oxygen to the rhizosphere for aerobic biodegradation 11 highest mre was observed in the summer season with a significant difference from the rainy seasons during the 1st and 2nd year but the difference was diminished in the 3rd year operation when the media became more matured previous study 33 also reported indifferent bod removal efficiencies in cws under harvested and non harvested condition similar to this study which found that the operation under the unplanted condition did not affect biodegradable organic removals more specifically the operation under no plant harvesting condition in this study did not provide adverse impact on biodegradable organic removals during 3 years operation the deposition of solids with observed ss removals of 56 6 75 9 together with biofilm and plant growth in the media resulted in a decrease in hydraulic permeability from 2 85 10 4 to 6 86 10 5 cm s but there was no sign of severe clogging condition of cw media during the whole operation period the removals of nitrogen were also moderately achieved and improved with time yearly average mre was 41 1 60 9 and 79 1 respectively the growth of typha sp helped to promote aerobic conditions and nitrification in the media resulting in a slight increase in oxidized nitrogen no 2 no 3 concentrations in the effluent i e 0 5 to 1 3 mg l at the beginning and the end of the 1st year operation nevertheless the proceeding of denitrification limited further increase of oxidized nitrogen with their concentrations kept below 1 0 mg l and their removals reached 77 in the 3rd year in cws denitrification was found that a greater extent than nitrification whereas simultaneous organic decomposition may accelerate the consumption of oxidized nitrogen thus limiting the growth of nitrifying bacteria 16 the seasonal effect on nitrogen removals was observed mainly only during the 1st year operation when plant growth was still progressing based on nitrogen mass balance determination plant uptake accounted for only 8 of nitrogen removal this finding agreed with the previous study 14 which reported at 12 of nitrogen was associated with plant typha sp growth in hssf cw the removal of nitrogen in hssf cw thus depended mainly on microbial transformation according to the previous study 33 nitrogen removal in the harvested cw could be higher up to about 1 6 times of that in the non harvested condition but the effects of annual harvesting was not notable until the latter years in long term operation annual harvesting may increase the proportion of nitrogen removal through plant uptake up to 52 whereas it was 26 under non harvested condition under such condition the harvesting of the plant is required for the effective removal of nitrogen in the cw nevertheless low contribution of plant uptake to nitrogen removal in this study would be beneficial for cw operation as it would require less frequent harvesting therefore it was anticipated that increased microbial activities in media possibly from enhanced oxygen transfer via longer plant root during plant growth was the main reason for the achievement of improved nitrogen removals considering the overall treatment performance of hssf cw applied to partially stabilized leachate in this study the organic and nitrogen removals could be achieved at satisfactory level during stable operation previous research 13 has also demonstrated successful application of hssf cw to landfill leachate with different degree of stabilization nevertheless the effluent qualities from single stage cw unit could not meet the discharge standards e g bod 20 mg l cod 120 mg l for thailand at all times therefore polishing treatment would be required to ensure that the effluent is safely discharged from the landfill site 3 3 omp removals fig 1 shows influent and effluent omp concentrations and their mres their influent concentrations fluctuated seasonally being higher during summer and lower during the rainy season from rainfall dilution for dep fig 1a the influent concentrations were averaged at 131 μg l whereas the effluent concentrations were found decreasing from 80 1 μg l during the 1st year to 55 7 μg l during the 2nd year and 44 0 μg l during the 3rd year operation respectively as a result their mres were determined as 52 9 65 1 and 74 6 respectively gradual improvement of dep removals could be contributed from the improvement of its biodegradation in cw media and it is considered its highly biodegradable characteristics among the studied omps during the summer season mres of dep became higher than yearly average at 58 3 74 3 and 80 3 respectively the presence of a high do level 1 7 2 7 mg l in cw media during summer also provided a positive impact on aerobic dep biodegradation for dbp fig 1b influent concentration avg 428 μg l was reduced to 319 5 μg l 168 7μg l and 112 2 μg l during 3 years operation with average mre of 51 8 66 4 and 72 5 respectively it was reported that dbp was removed through initial adsorption to cw media and subsequently biodegraded by microorganisms efficiently 19 higher removals of dbp were observed during the summer season during the 1st year operation but there was no significant difference between the seasons during the subsequent years the positive impact of warmer temperatures on dbp removals for vsf cw attributed to elevated biological activities was reported 34 the absence of rainfall and a higher degree of evapotranspiration thus yielding higher omp concentrations during the summer season could also affect its mres nevertheless the seasonal influence became diminished in the 2nd and 3rd years as the cw media and plant growth became more mature leading to a more stabilized environment for phenolic compounds mres of 2 6 dtbp were varied seasonally and averaged at 58 7 64 5 69 5 during the 1st 2nd and 3rd years fig 1c the bht removals were at a similar level at 58 7 68 7 and 67 1 respectively fig 1d their mres were higher achieved in summer dry season or elevated temperature condition similar to those reported in the literatures 23 25 35 previous research 25 suggested that warm climate provided a large amount of humate which can adsorb phenolic compounds meanwhile biodegradation was reported as the predominant removal mechanisms of micro pollutants 23 in the case of more hydrophobic pae dehp their influent concentrations were found highest avg 1 625 μg l and varied significantly among the operating years fig 1e after the treatment its effluent concentrations were highly detected at 1697 7 μg l during the 1st year but gradually reduced to 681 9 and 531 4 μg l in the 2nd and 3rd year overall moderate mre was achieved at 39 8 60 1 and 57 9 respectively dehp had a strong tendency to adsorb on the solid surface initially and biodegradation may also be occurring allowing regeneration of adsorption sites 36 in this study lower dehp removals were observed during the 1st year as the adsorption was only the predominant removal mechanism in cw media there was also a large fluctuation in its removals among the seasons being highest in summer as the influent concentrations were raised to a much higher level up to 3 600 μg l in the subsequent years the gradual development of biofilm enhanced its mres to a higher level mostly between 60 80 and the seasonal variation was much reduced even though the influent concentrations were still highly fluctuating during the summer season of the 2nd year as the influent concentrations were maintained more stable during the 3rd year the highest mre of 84 5 was achieved during its summer season comparing between all the studied compounds it was found that hssf cw could remove phenolic compounds 2 6 dtbp bht and hydrophilic phthalates dep dbp better than hydrophobic dehp during the 1st year operation this is in agreement with other short term study suggesting that poor removal of dehp was due to the presence of long ester chains in its molecular structure 17 however this study reveals that dehp removals could be much improved during long term operation as the cw became more mature and became at the same level as other omps moreover this study revealed that the operation under no plant harvesting condition did not adversely influence microbial omp degrading activities it was evidenced by increasing treatment efficiencies over time which is in agreement with those report in previous study 17 fig 2 shows the relationship between omps loading rate and their removals in cw generally higher omp loading rates led to better removal efficiencies for dep hssf cw could remove only 19 2 and 48 at its loading rates of less than 0 001 g m2 d 17 37 but they were as high as 74 1 at the loading rate of 0 05 g m2 d in this study there are similar trends for other compounds however vsf could remove omps better than hssf especially dbp which was removed up to 97 34 due to higher oxygen availability the removal of dehp in this study was also found higher than those reported in previous studies 17 37 3 4 accumulation of omps in media and plant the omp removal capacities of short term day 141 and long term day 785 operated media through adsorption and biodegradation were investigated in batch experiments the adsorptive removals of short term operated media were found to be 84 7 μg g for dep 113 6 μg g for dbp 140 4 μg g for 2 6 dtbp 154 4 μg g for bht and 156 4 μg g for dehp respectively table 2 these adsorption capacities were reduced to 61 5 μg g for dep 65 6 μg g for dbp 89 4 μg g for 2 6 dtbp 109 6 μg g for bht and 139 5 μg g for dehp during long term operation the reduced capacities were ranging from 11 for dehp to 42 for dbp the adsorption capacities of media varied depending on the hydrophobicity properties of omps being lowest for dep and highest for dehp the adsorptive removal was the main responsible for omp removals during the initial period for dep and dbp nevertheless the biodegradation became the predominated mechanism for all omps during long term operation the increase in biodegradation capacities of omps was found varied from 40 dehp to 115 2 6 dtbp during the operation the adsorbed amount of omps in cw media was found at a low level the maximum content of dep dbp 2 6 dtbp bht and dehp accumulated in cw media after 3 years operation was 0 072 0 083 1 954 2 819 and 14 926 μg g respectively in comparison to their adsorption capacities table 3 dep and dbp accumulation were found almost negligible 0 4 whereas they were at very low levels 2 8 for 2 6 dtbp and bht the only noticeable accumulation of dehp was observed but still accounted for only 10 7 of the adsorption capabilities of media these results suggested that the media did not become exhausted with omp adsorption and it could be sustainably operated in the long term it was anticipated that microbial activities of matured media have been developed for effective biodegradation and removal of the adsorbed omps omp accumulation was also found at a low level in the plant their content in shoot samples were 0 047 μg dep g 5 703 μg dbp g 2 516 μg 2 6 dtbp g and 3 249 μg bht g with highest content observed for dehp at 29 410 μg g for dep dbp and 2 6 dtbp the accumulation in root was less than shoot by 2 3 5 5 2 3 3 2 and 1 8 2 9 times whereas the root had a higher content of bht and dehp by 1 8 30 and 1 3 4 9 times respectively the hydrophobic compounds and their sorption to plant roots is likely influenced by the lipid content with the roots containing higher lipid content may preferentially accumulate hydrophobic compounds 37 from these results tfs were determined as 2 43 4 58 for dep 2 30 3 24 for dbp 1 78 2 77 for 2 6 dtbp 0 33 0 54 for bht and 0 20 0 75 dehp the tfs of omps with smaller molecular size dep dbp were found higher than those with larger molecules bht dehp which indicated that dep and dbp were easily transported from roots to shoots whereas dehp is mainly adsorbed and retained in roots 38 the fate of omp removals in cw during the whole operation period is summarized in table 3 it was found that most omps were mainly removed through biodegradation nevertheless the degree of its predomination varied among the studied omps dep and dbp were mostly removed with adsorption play a very minor role in their removals 2 1 meanwhile adsorptive removal of dehp accounted for up to 35 in the total removal for all omps their removals via plant uptake were low 2 3 5 microbial communities in cw media the morphology of the media surface examined by sem suggested the gradual development of biofilm along the operation period the pcr dgge profiles of microorganisms found on cw media on day 216 1st year and day 1031 3rd year are presented in fig 3 the presence of omp degrading bacteria i e burkholderia sp dechloromonas sp and rhodobacter sp 39 were confirmed during the 1st year operation moreover the biodegradation of omps has been attributed to the increased activity of ammonia monooxygenases amo that are present in nitrifying bacteria include ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob i e nitrosospira and aob bacterium 40 the plant could stimulate growth and enhance bacteria specialized for the degradation of the aromatic compounds 41 after 3 years there were additional omp degrading microbial species detected i e dechloromonas aromatica pseudomonas putida pseudomonas aeruginosa ralstonia sp rhodococcus sp rhodococcus rhodochrous sphingomonas sp and xanthomonas sp 39 42 whereas burkholderia sp and rhodococcus sp were retained in the microbial communities among them sphingomonas sp and rhodococcus rhodochrous 39 43 were reported on their dehp biodegradability which supported an observation dehp biodegradation improvement of long term operated cw media the h index of omp degrading microorganisms was also increasing from 0 480 at 1st year to 1 632 in 3rd year indicating the development of more diverse omp degrading microbial communities in the cw media during long term operation 4 conclusion the hssf cw with typha sp was successfully applied to the treatment of municipal landfill leachate under non harvested condition for 3 years in tropical climate moderate mass removals of organic micro pollutants i e 74 7 for dep 72 5 for dbp 69 5 for 2 6 dtbp 67 1 for bht and 57 9 for dehp were achieved when the media became matured highest removals were observed during summer season the biodegradation capacities of omps helped improving 8 4 21 7 of their removals over the operation period as microbial communities were developed in the media plant uptake and media adsorption contributed lowly to the removals of hydrophilic compounds dep dbp 2 6 dtbp and bht while only dehp was found adsorbed but biodegraded in the long term resulted in low level accumulation 10 of maximum adsorption capacities in media dehp degrading microbial consortium including sphingomonas sp and rhodococcus sp were well developed in mature cw media long term operation of hssf cw under no plant harvesting condition in tropical climate could develop microenvironments supporting the achievement of sustainable omp removals from landfill leachate declaration

removals were observed in the summer season when their influent concentrations became elevated hydrophilic dep and dbp compounds were mainly removed through biodegradation dehp was initially removed through adsorption but subsequently biodegraded in the long term therefore its accumulation in media was kept at low level i e 10 of maximum adsorption capacity during 3 years operation microbial community analyses reveal the presence of sphingomonas sp and rhodococcus sp as predominant microorganisms responsible for the biodegradation of omps this study shows an evidence for sustainable application of cw to the treatment of landfill leachate containing omps in the tropical climate keywords constructed wetland landfill leachate phthalic acid esters phenolic compounds tropical climate 1 introduction municipal landfill leachate is concentrated liquid generated during the disposal of municipal solid wastes msw major pollutants containing in landfill leachate are being regulated in most countries but even properly treated leachate may still pose an adverse impact to ecosystems from organic micro pollutants omps major omps detected in municipal landfill leachate include phthalic acid ester paes or phthalates i e diethyl phthalate dep dibutyl phthalate dbp bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp and phenolic compounds 2 6 di tert butylphenol 2 6 dtbp 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol bht 4 tert butylphenol 4 bp and bisphenol a bpa 1 3 they are mostly used as plasticizers to make plastic material more flexible and also used as antioxidants in foods and cosmetic preparations the removals of these compounds are generally varied widely depending on the type of treatment processes thus provided a different degree of ecological risk in the environment 4 their residuals could pose problems due to their adverse effects on human health and ecological safety when releasing into the natural environment 5 6 constructed wetlands cws are considered as cost effective and environmental friendly technology with high pollutant removal efficiencies cws are suitably applied to wastewater treatment in tropical climate because of warm temperatures steady solar energy flux high humidity conductive plant growth and heightened microbial activities 7 despite having several beneficial effects the operation of cws in tropical climate is facing other challenges such as variation of treatment performance between seasons thus cws may not be relied upon if its effluent qualities must meet stringent discharge standards at all times especially when the system has not yet reached stable condition moreover increased hydraulic flow anticipated during high intensity rainfall events during rainy seasons may result in solid clogging or periodical washout of accumulated solids from media generally cws can be classified into different types according to the water flow regime as a free water surface fws and subsurface flow cws ssf ssf cws can be further categorized into the horizontal subsurface flow hssf and vertical subsurface flow vsf cws the average removal efficiencies of fws were reported to be lower than those in other types of cws for all pollutants especially nutrients as compared to hssf and vsf various treatment mechanisms available within hssf and vsf cws helped to improve the removal efficiencies of pollutants 7 hssf cws are generally continuously fed with wastewater and therefore the filtration is carried out majorly in anaerobic or anoxic condition whereas the aerobic condition prevails only adjacent to plant root zone 8 vsf cws are fed intermittently and allow for oxygen diffusion into the filtration bed once the bed is emptied after the water percolated to the bottom therefore vsf cws have higher oxygen transfer capacity comparing to hssf cws thus resulting in better removal of ammonia under enhanced nitrification conditions 7 9 nevertheless they are prone to clogging with higher cost associations 10 generally hssf is a popular applied to the treatment of high organic strength wastewater including landfill leachate 8 9 with moderate organic removals 60 8 78 7 in terms of bod was reported over short term study 11 long term investigation 7 years using a combination of vsf and hssf units provided average bod removals of 59 during which the treatment performance was found significantly varied with precipitation but not with temperature 12 hssf cw with vetiver grass has also shown promising results when applied as pretreatment of highly contaminated composting leachate 10 nevertheless the degree of leachate stabilization also influenced the treatment performance of cws being more effective for fresh rather than partially stabilized leachate 13 moreover a significant reduction in leachate volume during the cw treatment was also reported 14 these positive results obtained from field studies suggested the applicability of cw technologies for reducing organic pollution at landfill sites nevertheless the treatment capacities of cws in the treatment and removal of omps presented in landfill leachate has not been fully explored most of the previous researches were carried in a short term study under a controlled environment using low strength wastewater such as municipal wastewater or domestic sewage in which moderate to high removals of hydrophilic phenolic compounds and paes such as bpa dbp and dep in vsf cw from biodegradation mechanism under aerobic condition were reported 15 19 it was also found that the presence of omps could stimulate the release of enzymes at plant rhizosphere to enhance the pollutant removals 16 comparatively lower removals of omps were reported in hssf cws than those observed in vsf 20 21 they were rarely removed in hssf cw especially under high loading conditions 22 the presence of the anaerobic condition nonetheless helped remove hydrophobic omps through adsorption and sedimentation mechanisms 23 moreover micro environments developed in the plant rhizosphere of hssf cw could also promote the removals of phenolic compounds i e bpa np 24 so far there is very limited information on omp removals in hssf operated under high organic loading in long term operation only laboratory scale vsf cw treating synthetic landfill leachate was reported to remove bpa well under short term operation at high influent concentration 25 therefore this research was carried out to elucidate the removal efficiencies of omps phenolic compounds 2 6 dtbp bht and phthalates dep dbp dehp in hssf using real landfill leachate operated under field condition of tropical climate over a long term period of 3 years to our knowledge this is the first field attempt to evaluate the long term removal of omps from landfill leachate in hssf cw operated under seasonal variations in the tropical climate the obtained information would be useful for the practical design of the cw treatment system to minimize the ecotoxicological impact of msw landfill operation on the natural water environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment a hssf cw unit 1 0 m width 2 0 m length 1 0 m depth made of concrete was installed at a municipal landfill in thailand the media zone 1 0 m width 1 6 m length 0 65 m depth was filled with sand media of 0 02 2 mm size porosity of 0 39 whereas the inlet and outlet zones 0 2 m length each were filled with 50 mm and 10 mm sized gravels respectively the unit was operated at a water depth was 0 55 m typha sp was planted in the cw unit with an initial density of 12 stems m2 raw leachate obtained from storage ponds in the landfill site was fed to the system at a constant flow rate of 80 l d equivalent to hydraulic loading rate hlr of 0 04 m3 m2 d table 1 shows the influent characteristics of landfill leachate during the operation period the omp concentrations detected in feeding landfill leachate during the operation period were 87 182 μg l for dep 257 786 μg l for dbp 207 480 μg l for 2 6 dtbp 248 553 μg l for bht and 748 3769 μg l for dehp respectively the cw performance was monitored from jul 2015 to may 2018 for a total period of 34 months during the operation hydraulic retention time hrt in the cw unit was varied between 5 8 to 6 9 days depending on the actual inflow feed leachate plus precipitation and outflow rates of the unit the allocation of the seasonal period was performed following the thai

the media samples were also collected at different depths 0 20 20 40 40 60 cm for mass balance determination media samples were freeze dried and homogenized by sieving through a stainless steel 60

washed with tap water and rinsed with distilled water and wiped dry with paper tissue before freeze dried then plant samples to storage at 20 c refrigerated until extraction for each sample extraction 10 g media and plant samples were extracted then samples water media and plant were analyzed omps with gc ms shimadzu gc ms qp2010 plus 2 3 omp adsorption and biodegradation capacities of cw media media samples were collected at the plant root zone 0 20 cm depth from media surface on day 141 1st year and day 785 3rd year and subject to batch experiments for determination of omp adsorption and biodegradation capacities all batch experiments were performed using 1 g media in 100 ml volume of the synthetic solution containing initial individual omp concentration of 5 000 μg l under shaking condition 200 rpm at room temperature 30 2 c the samples were taken for analysis at different times during 6 days similar to hrt of cw then subjected to centrifugation 7 000 rpm 10 min and the supernatant was used for omps analyses omp removals were calculated from the difference between the initial concentration and the final equilibrium concentration in the aqueous phase to distinguish between the removals through adsorption and biodegradation of omps in media samples batch experiments were performed to quantify adsorptive removal using inactive triplicated autoclaved at 121 c media and combined adsorption and biodegradation removals using active samples 2 4 microbial community analysis the microbial communities in cw media sampled at the plant root zone 0 20 cm depth at mid depth were analyzed on day 216 1st year and day 1031 days 3rd year by pcr dgge technique the 338gc f 518r primer was used to identify most of the bacteria species the pcr conditions were set as follows initial denaturation 95 c for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 95 c for 30 s 60 c for 10 s and 72 c for 25 s and a final extension at 72 c for 7 min for dgge analysis the samples containing equal amounts of pcr products were loaded onto 7 5 wt vol polyacrylamide gels in 1x tae buffer with a denaturing gradient ranging from 45 to 65 denaturants for the sample of day 216 and 43 to 68 denaturant gradients for the sample of day 1031 electrophoresis was performed at 60 c for 16 h at a constant voltage of 80 v following electrophoresis the gel was stained with sybr gold nucleic acid stain invitrogen usa for 30 min the images were visualized on a uv transilluminator and captured using biovision cn 1000 26 m vilber lourmat france the target dgge bands were excised resuspended in 20 μl of milliq water and stored at 4 c overnight the dna fragments recovered from the gel were used as templates for reamplification using primer set without gc clamp the amplified pcr products were purified sequenced and compared to known 16s rrna sequences in the genbank database using blast software 2 5 data analysis the pollutant removal efficiencies in the cw were calculated based on the mass removal efficiency mre as described in the following equation 1 m r e c 0 q 0 c i q i c 0 q 0 x 100 where c0 ci is influent and effluent pollutant concentrations and q0 qi is the influent and effluent flow rates respectively the translocation factor tf of omps in the cw was calculated using the following equation 2 t f c s h o o t c r o o t where cshoot and croot are omps contents in plant shoot and root respectively to determine the degree of microbial biodiversity the shannon weaver s index h describing species richness was determined by the following equation 3 h n i n i x log 2 n i n i where n i is the intensity of the band for each microbial species on the dgge fingerprint the statistical analysis was carried out using microsoft excel to obtain averages and standard deviations of concentrations of target contaminants one way anova was used to evaluate the statistical significance of the mre difference between seasons and operating years using spss version 22 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 environmental condition during the operation period the monthly mean temperature varied between 27 4 32 1 c total precipitation was 831 1350 and 1368 mm during the 1st 2nd and 3rd year of operation being highest in september at 218 5 in 15 days 358 5 in 23 days mm during the 1st and 2nd year and in october at 193 8 mm in 10 days during the 3rd year the relative humidity ranged between 64 83 along the operation years the observed amount of water lost through evapotranspiration et in the cw unit accounted for 34 3 45 1 and 41 1 of inflow water respectively they were recorded highest in april summer at 53 0 57 5 but the difference of et between seasons diminished in the latter years after the plant in the cw unit has been well developed in this study the cw unit with typha sp was operated without any plant harvesting the average plant heights of 1 04 1 57 cm 1 97 m and green shoot densities of 41 54 56 no m2 were recorded during the 3 years operation the growth of the plant in terms of plant height was observed during the 1st year of operation afterward the green and dried shoot numbers were found to fluctuate seasonally during the operating period the plant growth was found higher during the rainy season then the number of shoots and height dropped in winter and plant shoot became dried in summer but their heights were mostly maintained as a result biomass densities in the cw unit increased from 81 to 4878 g m2 with average root length increased from 5 cm to 13 cm this succession of plant growth would also influence et 29 30 as well as microbial communities 31 in the cw unit 3 2 treatment performance of hssf cw table 1 shows influent concentrations and mre of organic and nitrogen pollutants in different seasons during the operation the landfill leachate used in this study was partially stabilized in nature exhibiting in terms of alkaline ph 8 9 10 6 with low bod cod of 0 15 after cw treatment the effluent ph was slightly lowered to 8 4 due to acid formation during organic degradation and nitrification reaction meanwhile ec was found in the range between 8 2 10 1 ms cm possibly from the complex ions in landfill leachate 32 during the treatment mre of ec was found significantly increasing from 14 3 and 22 1 during the first 2 years to 42 6 during the 3rd years the precipitation of inorganic salts in the cw media resulted in an increased ec content in the media nevertheless there was no significant seasonal effect on mre of ec the influent bod and cod concentrations were not significantly varied among the seasons and operation years they were averaged at 147 9 and 1013 mg l respectively after the treatment the lowest average effluent bod and cod concentrations were observed in the summer season of the 3rd year at 48 3 mg l and 329 mg l during the operation mre of organic pollutants was increasing with operation time being 57 4 66 9 74 6 for bod and 51 1 67 5 76 9 for cod in the 1st 2nd and 3rd years respectively the improvement of organic removals was possibly contributed due to its deposition in the media and the development of microbial degradation through the attached biofilm on the media 9 32 the biodegradation of organic substances was also supported by the availability of oxygen through plant root transfer which increased the yearly average do level in rhizosphere from 1 2 mg l in the 1st year to 2 1 mg l in the 3rd year thus the plants only acted as a support media for microbial attachment while transferring oxygen to the rhizosphere for aerobic biodegradation 11 highest mre was observed in the summer season with a significant difference from the rainy seasons during the 1st and 2nd year but the difference was diminished in the 3rd year operation when the media became more matured previous study 33 also reported indifferent bod removal efficiencies in cws under harvested and non harvested condition similar to this study which found that the operation under the unplanted condition did not affect biodegradable organic removals more specifically the operation under no plant harvesting condition in this study did not provide adverse impact on biodegradable organic removals during 3 years operation the deposition of solids with observed ss removals of 56 6 75 9 together with biofilm and plant growth in the media resulted in a decrease in hydraulic permeability from 2 85 10 4 to 6 86 10 5 cm s but there was no sign of severe clogging condition of cw media during the whole operation period the removals of nitrogen were also moderately achieved and improved with time yearly average mre was 41 1 60 9 and 79 1 respectively the growth of typha sp helped to promote aerobic conditions and nitrification in the media resulting in a slight increase in oxidized nitrogen no 2 no 3 concentrations in the effluent i e 0 5 to 1 3 mg l at the beginning and the end of the 1st year operation nevertheless the proceeding of denitrification limited further increase of oxidized nitrogen with their concentrations kept below 1 0 mg l and their removals reached 77 in the 3rd year in cws denitrification was found that a greater extent than nitrification whereas simultaneous organic decomposition may accelerate the consumption of oxidized nitrogen thus limiting the growth of nitrifying bacteria 16 the seasonal effect on nitrogen removals was observed mainly only during the 1st year operation when plant growth was still progressing based on nitrogen mass balance determination plant uptake accounted for only 8 of nitrogen removal this finding agreed with the previous study 14 which reported at 12 of nitrogen was associated with plant typha sp growth in hssf cw the removal of nitrogen in hssf cw thus depended mainly on microbial transformation according to the previous study 33 nitrogen removal in the harvested cw could be higher up to about 1 6 times of that in the non harvested condition but the effects of annual harvesting was not notable until the latter years in long term operation annual harvesting may increase the proportion of nitrogen removal through plant uptake up to 52 whereas it was 26 under non harvested condition under such condition the harvesting of the plant is required for the effective removal of nitrogen in the cw nevertheless low contribution of plant uptake to nitrogen removal in this study would be beneficial for cw operation as it would require less frequent harvesting therefore it was anticipated that increased microbial activities in media possibly from enhanced oxygen transfer via longer plant root during plant growth was the main reason for the achievement of improved nitrogen removals considering the overall treatment performance of hssf cw applied to partially stabilized leachate in this study the organic and nitrogen removals could be achieved at satisfactory level during stable operation previous research 13 has also demonstrated successful application of hssf cw to landfill leachate with different degree of stabilization nevertheless the effluent qualities from single stage cw unit could not meet the discharge standards e g bod 20 mg l cod 120 mg l for thailand at all times therefore polishing treatment would be required to ensure that the effluent is safely discharged from the landfill site 3 3 omp removals fig 1 shows influent and effluent omp concentrations and their mres their influent concentrations fluctuated seasonally being higher during summer and lower during the rainy season from rainfall dilution for dep fig 1a the influent concentrations were averaged at 131 μg l whereas the effluent concentrations were found decreasing from 80 1 μg l during the 1st year to 55 7 μg l during the 2nd year and 44 0 μg l during the 3rd year operation respectively as a result their mres were determined as 52 9 65 1 and 74 6 respectively gradual improvement of dep removals could be contributed from the improvement of its biodegradation in cw media and it is considered its highly biodegradable characteristics among the studied omps during the summer season mres of dep became higher than yearly average at 58 3 74 3 and 80 3 respectively the presence of a high do level 1 7 2 7 mg l in cw media during summer also provided a positive impact on aerobic dep biodegradation for dbp fig 1b influent concentration avg 428 μg l was reduced to 319 5 μg l 168 7μg l and 112 2 μg l during 3 years operation with average mre of 51 8 66 4 and 72 5 respectively it was reported that dbp was removed through initial adsorption to cw media and subsequently biodegraded by microorganisms efficiently 19 higher removals of dbp were observed during the summer season during the 1st year operation but there was no significant difference between the seasons during the subsequent years the positive impact of warmer temperatures on dbp removals for vsf cw attributed to elevated biological activities was reported 34 the absence of rainfall and a higher degree of evapotranspiration thus yielding higher omp concentrations during the summer season could also affect its mres nevertheless the seasonal influence became diminished in the 2nd and 3rd years as the cw media and plant growth became more mature leading to a more stabilized environment for phenolic compounds mres of 2 6 dtbp were varied seasonally and averaged at 58 7 64 5 69 5 during the 1st 2nd and 3rd years fig 1c the bht removals were at a similar level at 58 7 68 7 and 67 1 respectively fig 1d their mres were higher achieved in summer dry season or elevated temperature condition similar to those reported in the literatures 23 25 35 previous research 25 suggested that warm climate provided a large amount of humate which can adsorb phenolic compounds meanwhile biodegradation was reported as the predominant removal mechanisms of micro pollutants 23 in the case of more hydrophobic pae dehp their influent concentrations were found highest avg 1 625 μg l and varied significantly among the operating years fig 1e after the treatment its effluent concentrations were highly detected at 1697 7 μg l during the 1st year but gradually reduced to 681 9 and 531 4 μg l in the 2nd and 3rd year overall moderate mre was achieved at 39 8 60 1 and 57 9 respectively dehp had a strong tendency to adsorb on the solid surface initially and biodegradation may also be occurring allowing regeneration of adsorption sites 36 in this study lower dehp removals were observed during the 1st year as the adsorption was only the predominant removal mechanism in cw media there was also a large fluctuation in its removals among the seasons being highest in summer as the influent concentrations were raised to a much higher level up to 3 600 μg l in the subsequent years the gradual development of biofilm enhanced its mres to a higher level mostly between 60 80 and the seasonal variation was much reduced even though the influent concentrations were still highly fluctuating during the summer season of the 2nd year as the influent concentrations were maintained more stable during the 3rd year the highest mre of 84 5 was achieved during its summer season comparing between all the studied compounds it was found that hssf cw could remove phenolic compounds 2 6 dtbp bht and hydrophilic phthalates dep dbp better than hydrophobic dehp during the 1st year operation this is in agreement with other short term study suggesting that poor removal of dehp was due to the presence of long ester chains in its molecular structure 17 however this study reveals that dehp removals could be much improved during long term operation as the cw became more mature and became at the same level as other omps moreover this study revealed that the operation under no plant harvesting condition did not adversely influence microbial omp degrading activities it was evidenced by increasing treatment efficiencies over time which is in agreement with those report in previous study 17 fig 2 shows the relationship between omps loading rate and their removals in cw generally higher omp loading rates led to better removal efficiencies for dep hssf cw could remove only 19 2 and 48 at its loading rates of less than 0 001 g m2 d 17 37 but they were as high as 74 1 at the loading rate of 0 05 g m2 d in this study there are similar trends for other compounds however vsf could remove omps better than hssf especially dbp which was removed up to 97 34 due to higher oxygen availability the removal of dehp in this study was also found higher than those reported in previous studies 17 37 3 4 accumulation of omps in media and plant the omp removal capacities of short term day 141 and long term day 785 operated media through adsorption and biodegradation were investigated in batch experiments the adsorptive removals of short term operated media were found to be 84 7 μg g for dep 113 6 μg g for dbp 140 4 μg g for 2 6 dtbp 154 4 μg g for bht and 156 4 μg g for dehp respectively table 2 these adsorption capacities were reduced to 61 5 μg g for dep 65 6 μg g for dbp 89 4 μg g for 2 6 dtbp 109 6 μg g for bht and 139 5 μg g for dehp during long term operation the reduced capacities were ranging from 11 for dehp to 42 for dbp the adsorption capacities of media varied depending on the hydrophobicity properties of omps being lowest for dep and highest for dehp the adsorptive removal was the main responsible for omp removals during the initial period for dep and dbp nevertheless the biodegradation became the predominated mechanism for all omps during long term operation the increase in biodegradation capacities of omps was found varied from 40 dehp to 115 2 6 dtbp during the operation the adsorbed amount of omps in cw media was found at a low level the maximum content of dep dbp 2 6 dtbp bht and dehp accumulated in cw media after 3 years operation was 0 072 0 083 1 954 2 819 and 14 926 μg g respectively in comparison to their adsorption capacities table 3 dep and dbp accumulation were found almost negligible 0 4 whereas they were at very low levels 2 8 for 2 6 dtbp and bht the only noticeable accumulation of dehp was observed but still accounted for only 10 7 of the adsorption capabilities of media these results suggested that the media did not become exhausted with omp adsorption and it could be sustainably operated in the long term it was anticipated that microbial activities of matured media have been developed for effective biodegradation and removal of the adsorbed omps omp accumulation was also found at a low level in the plant their content in shoot samples were 0 047 μg dep g 5 703 μg dbp g 2 516 μg 2 6 dtbp g and 3 249 μg bht g with highest content observed for dehp at 29 410 μg g for dep dbp and 2 6 dtbp the accumulation in root was less than shoot by 2 3 5 5 2 3 3 2 and 1 8 2 9 times whereas the root had a higher content of bht and dehp by 1 8 30 and 1 3 4 9 times respectively the hydrophobic compounds and their sorption to plant roots is likely influenced by the lipid content with the roots containing higher lipid content may preferentially accumulate hydrophobic compounds 37 from these results tfs were determined as 2 43 4 58 for dep 2 30 3 24 for dbp 1 78 2 77 for 2 6 dtbp 0 33 0 54 for bht and 0 20 0 75 dehp the tfs of omps with smaller molecular size dep dbp were found higher than those with larger molecules bht dehp which indicated that dep and dbp were easily transported from roots to shoots whereas dehp is mainly adsorbed and retained in roots 38 the fate of omp removals in cw during the whole operation period is summarized in table 3 it was found that most omps were mainly removed through biodegradation nevertheless the degree of its predomination varied among the studied omps dep and dbp were mostly removed with adsorption play a very minor role in their removals 2 1 meanwhile adsorptive removal of dehp accounted for up to 35 in the total removal for all omps their removals via plant uptake were low 2 3 5 microbial communities in cw media the morphology of the media surface examined by sem suggested the gradual development of biofilm along the operation period the pcr dgge profiles of microorganisms found on cw media on day 216 1st year and day 1031 3rd year are presented in fig 3 the presence of omp degrading bacteria i e burkholderia sp dechloromonas sp and rhodobacter sp 39 were confirmed during the 1st year operation moreover the biodegradation of omps has been attributed to the increased activity of ammonia monooxygenases amo that are present in nitrifying bacteria include ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob i e nitrosospira and aob bacterium 40 the plant could stimulate growth and enhance bacteria specialized for the degradation of the aromatic compounds 41 after 3 years there were additional omp degrading microbial species detected i e dechloromonas aromatica pseudomonas putida pseudomonas aeruginosa ralstonia sp rhodococcus sp rhodococcus rhodochrous sphingomonas sp and xanthomonas sp 39 42 whereas burkholderia sp and rhodococcus sp were retained in the microbial communities among them sphingomonas sp and rhodococcus rhodochrous 39 43 were reported on their dehp biodegradability which supported an observation dehp biodegradation improvement of long term operated cw media the h index of omp degrading microorganisms was also increasing from 0 480 at 1st year to 1 632 in 3rd year indicating the development of more diverse omp degrading microbial communities in the cw media during long term operation 4 conclusion the hssf cw with typha sp was successfully applied to the treatment of municipal landfill leachate under non harvested condition for 3 years in tropical climate moderate mass removals of organic micro pollutants i e 74 7 for dep 72 5 for dbp 69 5 for 2 6 dtbp 67 1 for bht and 57 9 for dehp were achieved when the media became matured highest removals were observed during summer season the biodegradation capacities of omps helped improving 8 4 21 7 of their removals over the operation period as microbial communities were developed in the media plant uptake and media adsorption contributed lowly to the removals of hydrophilic compounds dep dbp 2 6 dtbp and bht while only dehp was found adsorbed but biodegraded in the long term resulted in low level accumulation 10 of maximum adsorption capacities in media dehp degrading microbial consortium including sphingomonas sp and rhodococcus sp were well developed in mature cw media long term operation of hssf cw under no plant harvesting condition in tropical climate could develop microenvironments supporting the achievement of sustainable omp removals from landfill leachate declaration

92 of di water flux on water flushing long term studies showed excellent stability and membrane flux recovery on flushing thus membranes with scs exhibit high degree of resistance for heavily fouling stabilized oil water emulsions with high oil content these membranes exhibit excellent potential for further large scale development and for wide range of applications keywords mixed matrix membranes sulphonated carbon soot stabilized oil water emulsion oil removal 1 introduction large amounts of oily wastewater is discharged every day in industrial processes in chemical petrochemical textile food metal processing industries the direct discharge of such wastewater is a reason for impairment of environmental and public health 1 besides environmental and health hazards the rising water crisis is also a potential driving force for the recovery of water from waste streams traditional oil water treatment methods like mechanical separation skimming air flotation coagulation settling can be used for separation of oil water mixtures but are ineffective for separation of stabilized oil water emulsions especially when the droplet sizes are in sub micron range ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf have emerged as processes for efficient separation of stabilized oil water emulsions polysulfone is commonly used in ultrafiltration membranes due its good thermal and mechanical properties inert nature and chemical resistance however polysulfone is susceptible to fouling that severely reduce membrane permeate flux necessitate chemical cleaning and decrease membrane life 2 4 the oil water emulsion separation process in uf and mf membrane operations is based on size exclusion larger droplets are excluded from the fine pores in the membranes due to differential wetting characteristics of the membrane an oil droplet has to overcome additional capillary forces to enter a hydrophilic non wetted pore wenzel s theory of wettability indicates a smooth surface is likely to exhibit higher wettability most polymers used in synthesis of membranes such as polysulfone are hydrophobic with preferential affinity towards oil which gives rise to severe fouling during oil water emulsion separations during filtration rejected oil droplets accumulate on the membrane surface and over time may overcome capillary forces to deposit in the pores causing pore blockage hydrophilic surfaces on the other hand are naturally antifouling as the oil droplets cannot adhere on a hydrophilic membrane surface a hydrophobic surface that excludes water and allows transport of oil is also appropriate however the higher viscosity of oil as well as higher intrinsic resistance of a hydrophilic surface to oil over that of hydrophobic surface towards water make hydrophilic materials more efficient for oil water separations previous studies on modification of membranes for improving hydrophilicity have used two approaches a use of surface modifications 5 6 and b blending of various hydrophilic additives and fillers 7 to improve fouling resistance surface modification is more beneficial for protein and other natural organic matter fouling rather than oil water separations since the pores themselves may remain hydrophobic after surface treatment and any oil that enters the pores and gets adsorbed will cause further fouling the surface coating adds one of more manufacturing steps and increase the cost of the membranes additionally antifouling coatings may also get eroded over time necessitating re treatment alternatively use of hydrophilic additives during membrane synthesis improves surface as well as bulk hydrophilicity additives reported for improving anti fouling properties include macromolecules 8 12 inorganic nanoparticles 3 13 21 carbon nanomaterials 4 22 23 inorganic nanomaterials are more effective than polymeric additives however most inorganic nanomaterials are expensive to produce and frequently require use of organometallic precursors which may be toxic carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide are unique since chemical modification is readily possible however both carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide are expensive bulk manufacture of graphene oxide requires use of high amount of oxidizing agents such as kmno4 or kclo3 in addition to large amount of h2so4 and hno3 24 while hazardous reducing agents such as nabh4 hydrazine hydrate are used to synthesize reduced graphene oxide 25 activated carbon is green inexpensive and readily available carbon material but it is difficult to obtain in nanoparticle form and is not as effective antifouling additive as carbon nanomaterials in macroparticle polymer ultrafiltration composite membranes 26 27 carbon soot on the other hand is naturally formed in nanoparticle form with sizes between 10 80 nm 28 one disadvantage of soot obtained from combustion phenomena contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons some of which are mutagens or carcinogens however studies have confirmed that no pah were detected in the soots from candle wax 29 soot is however naturally superhydrophobic 30 candle soot is hydrophobic with very few oxygen functionality hierarchical morphology with nanoscale roughness when water droplet in contact with soot creates nano sized air gap giving high contact angle and superhydrophobic surface however if the surface becomes hydrophilic the composite interface between solid liquid and air may become unstable and lead to transition to homogeneous interface which is wetting of the surface 31 we therefore derivatized carbon by addition of sulphonic acid groups in a one pot reaction by reacting candle soot with benzenediazonium sulphonate in presence of hypophosphorus acid to give sulphonated carbon soot scs benzenediazonium sulphonate

polysulfone beads under continuous stirring at 60 c for 24 h the dope solutions were then degassed by sonication for 1 h and were left undisturbed for 24 h dope solution were spread on glass plate

estimated by measuring the di water flux the fouled membrane flux and the di water permeate flux recovered after simple flushing permeation experiments were performed using a crossflow permeation cell with an effective membrane area of 10 cm2 at a transmembrane pressure of 1 bar the amount of permeate collected was measured using a weighing balance connected to a computer for automated data

characterization of candle soot and sulphonated candle soot candle soot collected on a stainless steel plate over candle wax flame was sulphonated using in situ generated 4 benzenediazonium sulphonate as shown in scheme in fig 1 a sulphonation was evident on dispersion of candle soot sulphonated candle soot in water candle soot contains limited number of oxygen or heteroatom containing functional groups and is hydrophobic carbon soot deposited from incomplete combustion of paraffin did not disperse in water fig 1 b however candle soot became hydrophilic on sulphonation and dispersed readily in water as shown in fig 1 b indicating hydrophilization the suspension of sulphonated candle soot was stable and did not settle in over 3 weeks fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir of candle soot before and after sulphonation was performed to identify the change in functional groups in the carbon matrix after sulphonation fig 2 the spectra of candle soot does not display many peaks the spectra of sulphonated carbon soot showed peaks at 3520 cm 1 and 3305 cm 1 attributed to hydroxyl groups the peak at 1339 cm 1 can be attributed to so2 asymmetric stretching while the peaks at 1124 5 cm 1 and 1196 cm 1 are due to so2 symmetric stretching the peaks at 1009 cm 1 and 1035 cm 1 correspond to s o stretching the peaks corresponding to c s stretching are found between 555 5 cm 1 and 685 cm 1 confirming sulphonation the elemental composition of scs was estimated using edx analysis giving 9 4 wt sulphur and 14 1 wt oxygen in the matrix esi fig s1 sem analysis revealed spherical candle soot particles of approximate diameter 66 nm while the particle size of scs was approximately 51 nm esi fig s2 bet surface area of the candle soot increased from 81 m2 g to 94 m2 g after sulphonation however the average pore diameter and the pore volume of the soot decreased from 6 nm to 3 nm and 0 52 cm3 g to 0 15 cm3 g after sulphonation respectively the decrease in the pore diameter is likely due to effect of functionalization additionally the evaporation of water during drying after sulphonation may also have contributed to collapse in pores 3 2 characterization of membranes membrane dope solutions were prepared by blending candle soot and sulphonated candle soot with polysulphone in nmp using pvp of average molecular weight of 5 kda as pore forming agent and are shown in table 1 blending of carbon materials in proportion greater than 1 w w solution presented difficulties during homogenization of membrane dope solutions pure polysulfone polymer film will get fouled due to oil proteins and hydrophobic moieties during usage and an increase in the hydrophilicity will minimize fouling during those separations contact angle study of the membranes is presented in fig 3 addition of unmodified candle soot increased the contact angle from 45 for psf pvp control membrane to 55 for cs 0 25 membrane indicating a decrease in hydrophilic character of the membrane on the other hand addition of scs to the membrane matrix increased hydrophilicity of the membranes the contact angle of the membranes decreased with increasing scs content scs 1 0 membranes with 1 sulphonated candle soot in the membrane matrix displayed the lowest contact angle of 31 surface energy δgmw of the synthesized membranes was estimated from the modified form of young dupre equation eq 3 and is presented in table 1 hydrophobic surfaces have lower surface energy while surfaces with higher surface energy are readily wetted by water a more wetting surface with have a higher value of interfacial surface energy the surface energy of cs 0 25 membranes was lowest among the membranes synthesized owing to hydrophobic matrix psf membrane has higher surface energy than cs 0 25 the addition of sulphonated soot resulted in an increase in surface energy as the amount of sulphonated candle soot increased in the dope solution the surface free energy increased scs 1 0 membrane surface had highest surface energy thus addition of hydrophilic matrix increased the surface energy of the membrane and increasing the content of hydrophilic matrix to 1 wt membrane dope solution gave scs 1 0 membranes with highest surface energy and therefore highest wettability overall porosity ε was estimated by measuring the water uptake of the membrane as shown in table 1 presence of sulphonated candle soot in the dope solution enhanced the porosity of the membranes the porosity increased with an increase in the concentration of the sulphonated candle soot from 24 in psf membrane to 35 7 for scs 1 0 membrane during phase inversion mixing of solvent and anti solvent occurs creating instabilities about which the polymer precipitates the presence of insoluble matrices such as carbon soot and sulphonated carbon soot act as nucleation sites for faster precipitation of polymer increase in amount of matrix increases the number of nucleation sites giving membrane with large number of smaller pores and therefore the membranes exhibit higher flux along with good rejection higher porosity commonly results in membranes with lower tensile strength on addition of cs the tensile strength of the membranes increased by about 10 while the addition of scs to the membrane matrix decreased the tensile strength by about 33 and 25 for scs 0 5 and scs 1 0 membranes respectively table 1 in addition to higher porosity the reason for decrease in tensile strength might be due to dissimilar nature of polysulfone and sulphonated candle soot that may have created inhomogeneities in the membrane matrix during phase inversion sem images of the surface of the membranes are presented in fig 4 the surface of the membranes is slightly rough with nearly circular pores for psf the surface of cs 0 25 is rough with presence of very few pores in contrast with the surface of scs 0 25 which shows much higher surface porosity the surface morphology of scs 0 5 scs 0 75 and scs 1 0 was similar to that of scs 0 25 sem images of the cross section of the membranes are also shown in fig 4 the membrane cross sections show rich hierarchical pore structure typical of phase inversion membranes the structure is asymmetric with relatively finely porous top layer while the polymer immediately below the top layer show finger like elongated pores which further transform in to large voids the polymer enclosing the voids and pores is also finely porous afm images of the membranes are shown in fig 4 the root mean square roughness of the surface was estimated from afm topographic information and is presented in table 1 the membranes were quite smooth with the values of the roughness being lower than 100 nm control membrane of psf pvp showed a rms roughness of only 27 6 nm which marginally decreased when carbon soot was added the addition of carbon soot also decreased the contact angle in contrast addition of scs increased surface roughness the roughness increased as the amount of scs in the polymer matrix increased except in the case of 0 75 scs membranes for reasons unknown the roughness observed was lowered higher roughness combined with lower water contact angle resulted in surfaces with high surface energy which increased hydrophilicity 3 3 permeation and fouling characteristics of synthesized membranes the performance of the synthesized membranes was studied for recovery of water from diesel water d w emulsions the membranes were first subjected to bubble point test to identify any defects the membranes studied did not give a bubble point until 10 bar therefore were considered to be free of pin hole defects the membranes were characterized for their di water flux rejection of diesel as well as for the recovery of membrane performance upon flushing with water fig 5 shows the comparison of the di water flux 5 d w emulsion flux and the recovered water flux of psf cs 0 25 scs 0 5 and scs 1 0 membranes pure water flux is shown in the first part of fig 5 the membranes were compacted initially and di water flux was measured subsequently after 2000s of steady flux the feed solution was switched from di water to 5 diesel in water emulsion stabilized by triton x100 the variation of flux during filtration of d w emulsion is shown in the second part of the fig 5 under section emulsion after about 7000 s of emulsion filtration the fouled membranes were flushed with water to remove any diesel adsorbed on the membrane top layer for 10 min at zero transmembrane pressure the feed was then switched to di water again and the permeate flux was monitored at 1 bar transmembrane pressure fig 5 section di water after flushing and is represented as recovered flux the di water flux of scs 0 25 was lowest followed by flux of cs 0 25 and psf while scs 1 0 exhibited highest flux that was about 80 higher than unmodified psf diesel in water emulsion flux of psf cs 0 25 and scs 0 25 was almost the same while that of scs 1 0 was about 100 higher than that of psf both psf cs 0 25 and scs 0 25 got fouled quickly and the flux remained almost constant on the other hand scs 1 0 membranes showed a gradual decrease of flux over approximately 7000 s of 5 d w emulsion filtration other membranes studied had almost reached a steady state within first 1000s of d w emulsion filtration while the permeate flux of d w emulsion showed a decline for scs 1 0 membranes and did not reach a steady state even after 7000 s of crossflow filtration this behaviour provides an evidence of anti fouling property of the scs 1 0 membranes on flushing the membranes with di water a recovery of 36 in the di water permeate flux over fouled flux is obtained for psf cs 0 25 and scs 0 25 while 60 increase in the permeate flux was obtained for scs 1 0 membranes the recovered di water permeate flux of scs 1 0 membranes was 2 35 fold larger compared to that of the control psf membrane after flushing the permeate flux on recovery for cs 0 25 appeared to achieve a steady state at a value that was slightly less than half of the pure water flux of cs 0 25 however other membranes exhibited very gradual decline in di water flux upon flushing the decline was more pronounced in flux of scs 1 0 the decline in di water flux after flushing may be due to irreversible fouling of the membrane by diesel during diesel water emulsion separations the emulsion may remain stable or may break as water is removed if the emulsion remains stable the diesel droplets accumulate near the membrane surface forming a concentration polarization layer on the other hand if the emulsion breaks oil droplets merge forming larger droplets the large and small droplets could either be swept away or could come in contact with the membrane surface forming a film causing fouling the pores of ultrafiltration membrane are much larger than the molecules in diesel and if the pores of the membrane are not hydrophilic oil film and droplets will enter the membrane pores leading to internal fouling however if the membrane pores are hydrophilic capillary forces have to be overcome before oil can enter the pores therefore hydrophilic membranes will display higher fouling resistance to oil fouling during emulsion separation the average particle size of d w emulsions was about 240 nm and is much higher than the pores of the membrane we observed that the emulsion droplet size decreased from an average droplet diameter of 5 5 μm before the beginning of the filtration to about 1 3 μm after the filtration figure s3 higher normalized recovered flux indicated that diesel droplets remained on the surface and did not permeate the pores of the membrane these droplets were swept away during flushing giving a refreshed membrane surface the rejection of d w emulsion was estimated from toc analysis of permeate and diluted feed solutions psf and cs 0 25 exhibited diesel rejection of 97 and 98 respectively while scs containing membranes displayed greater than 99 7 rejection fig 6 since diesel did not permeate the membrane pores the rejection of scs membranes was substantially higher than cs 0 25 and psf membranes presence of minor amount of organic carbon in permeate was likely due to triton x100 that may have dissolved in water and come out in permeate lower rejection of diesel from psf and cs 0 25 membranes signify that some pores were hydrophobic enough to allow ingress of diesel in permeate a comparison of average di water flux 5 d w emulsion flux and recovered di water flux after water flushing and rejection of diesel is plotted in fig 6 di water flux of the membranes with scs content less than 0 75 lower than that of unmodified polysulphone membranes hydrophobic cs 0 25 membranes had lower flux than psf for reasons unclear the flux of scs 0 25 membranes was lower than that of cs 0 25 di water flux increased with increasing scs content with maximum flux displayed by scs 1 0 membranes the permeate flux dropped substantially during filtration of 5 d w emulsion fouled flux was lowest for psf membranes followed by cs 0 25 membranes the fouled flux increased with increase in the of scs in the membrane matrix with the scs 1 0 membranes exhibiting maximum flux which was 240 psf membrane flux on flushing with water the flux of all the membranes recovered to certain extent diesel interacts strongest with candle soot over other materials used in membrane synthesis and likewise cs 0 25 membranes showed lowest improvement in recovered flux indicating that the hydrophobic cs 0 25 membranes with candle soot matrix was fouled intensely 72 of unfouled pure water flux was recovered by simple flushing of scs 1 0 containing membranes was much better than 56 and 49 obtained for psf and cs 0 25 membranes respectively thus incorporation of hydrophilized sulphonated the hydrophilisation of candle soot in membrane matrix leads to development of fouling resistant membranes the effect was more pronounced at high scs concentration the effect of hydrophilicity is apparent when comparing the intrinsic reversible and irreversible resistances of the membranes shown in fig 7 a the intrinsic membrane resistance decreases with increasing scs content while the reversible membrane resistance is very high for cs 0 25 followed by psf membranes scs containing membranes exhibit lower irreversible resistance and among those scs 0 75 membranes had the lowest resistance fig 7b shows a plot of normalized recovered flux plotted against the di water flux a higher flux as well as higher recovered flux is desirable for a membrane for separation of fouling mixtures relatively hydrophobic membranes psf and cs 0 25 are near the bottom left corner indicating poor permeate flux as well as high fouling tendencies while scs 1 0 membrane bore highest flux as well as good recovery in permeate flux after fouling scs 1 0 membranes display higher porosity lower contact angle higher flux higher rejection as well as higher normalized recovered flux more hydrophilic pores combined with more porous scs 1 0 membranes gave highest water permeability j w j f as well as high rejection of diesel increased hydrophilicity on addition of sulphonated candle soot particles also manifested as higher normalized recovered flux as the hydrophobic suspended particles diesel droplets are easily removed from the membrane surface during water flushing most studies that report higher normalized recovered flux have performed fouling studies with much lower oil concentrations 1 while we report flux as high as 156 lmh bar with 5 d w emulsion with over 92 recovery of flux on water flushing 35 36 the performance of scs 1 0 membranes was evaluated for highly fouling feed of 50 diesel water emulsion in addition to 5 diesel water emulsion table 2 the fouling due to 50 diesel water emulsion was significant with resulting long term average fouled flux of about 10 lmh bar the recovered flux was actually lower on flushing the membrane with water which was surprising if is likely that during flushing with water any residual diesel in the membrane got entrenched in the pores exacerbating fouling surfactants or other chemical cleaning agents may be needed to clean such heavily fouled membrane however there have been no other studies reporting such high fouled flux for extreme fouling 50 diesel water emulsion with over 99 98 rejection the reversibility of fouling was also evaluated by carrying out periodic membrane cleaning with flushing during flushing transmembrane pressure was relieved feed was switched to di water and passed over the membrane any layer formed on the membrane due to concentration polarization or external fouling is likely to be flushed away fouling layer that is strongly bound to the membrane will not be removed by flushing the effect of periodic cleaning by water flushing on permeate flux of scs 1 0 membranes was studied and was compared with psf membranes the membranes were subjected to filtration of 5 diesel water emulsion for 20 min followed by forward flushing with di water for 1 min psf membranes quickly become irreversibly fouled during the filtration the flux recovered by flushing psf membranes is minimal giving almost constant flux over 8000 s of filtration as shown in fig 8 scs 1 0 membranes display much larger recovery in the permeate flux after washing over psf membranes scs 1 0 membranes do get fouled gradually with permeate flux decreasing with each successive cycle however the permeate flux recovers to almost the same value on flushing the decline in permeate flux recovery is about 9 over 8000 s therefore scs 1 0 membranes display much higher resistance to irreversible fouling over psf membranes and that the performance can be boosted by simple flushing for a short time 4 conclusion in this work we have synthesized robust hydrophilized polysulfone membranes blending inexpensive particles obtained from candle soot candle soot particles were sulphonated in a one pot reaction and then mixed with polysulphone to give hydrophilic membranes a comparison of effect of sulphonation of candle soot on membrane properties was also carried out the results revealed improved hydrophilic character along with decreased membrane resistance both membrane permeability as well as rejection was improved on addition of sulphonated candle soot in the membrane matrix addition of 1 of sulphonated candle soot resulted in membranes that showed about 1 8 fold increase in water permeability and approximately 2 5 fold improvement in diesel water emulsion flux with greater than 99 7 rejection of diesel scs psf mixed matrix membranes also demonstrated outstanding flux recovery as high as 93 on flushing with deionized water summarizing we have developed a high flux robust polysulfone mixed matrix ultrafiltration membrane with candle soot obtained from candle soot an abundant and inexpensive material which was modified in a single step the synthesized membrane displays outstanding fouling resistance with high degree of reversible fouling that can be reversed by simple flushing with deionized water therefore synthesized membranes will find wide application in separations involving fouling feeds declaration of

13786,severe fouling is observed during water recovery from oil in water emulsions mixed matrix membranes include hydrophilic additives such as metal oxide nanoparticles decrease fouling tendencies however most metal oxide nanoparticles are either expensive or synthesized from hazardous precursors candle soot is an inexpensive source of almost monodisperse carbon nanoparticles but it is

92 of di water flux on water flushing long term studies showed excellent stability and membrane flux recovery on flushing thus membranes with scs exhibit high degree of resistance for heavily fouling stabilized oil water emulsions with high oil content these membranes exhibit excellent potential for further large scale development and for wide range of applications keywords mixed matrix membranes sulphonated carbon soot stabilized oil water emulsion oil removal 1 introduction large amounts of oily wastewater is discharged every day in industrial processes in chemical petrochemical textile food metal processing industries the direct discharge of such wastewater is a reason for impairment of environmental and public health 1 besides environmental and health hazards the rising water crisis is also a potential driving force for the recovery of water from waste streams traditional oil water treatment methods like mechanical separation skimming air flotation coagulation settling can be used for separation of oil water mixtures but are ineffective for separation of stabilized oil water emulsions especially when the droplet sizes are in sub micron range ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf have emerged as processes for efficient separation of stabilized oil water emulsions polysulfone is commonly used in ultrafiltration membranes due its good thermal and mechanical properties inert nature and chemical resistance however polysulfone is susceptible to fouling that severely reduce membrane permeate flux necessitate chemical cleaning and decrease membrane life 2 4 the oil water emulsion separation process in uf and mf membrane operations is based on size exclusion larger droplets are excluded from the fine pores in the membranes due to differential wetting characteristics of the membrane an oil droplet has to overcome additional capillary forces to enter a hydrophilic non wetted pore wenzel s theory of wettability indicates a smooth surface is likely to exhibit higher wettability most polymers used in synthesis of membranes such as polysulfone are hydrophobic with preferential affinity towards oil which gives rise to severe fouling during oil water emulsion separations during filtration rejected oil droplets accumulate on the membrane surface and over time may overcome capillary forces to deposit in the pores causing pore blockage hydrophilic surfaces on the other hand are naturally antifouling as the oil droplets cannot adhere on a hydrophilic membrane surface a hydrophobic surface that excludes water and allows transport of oil is also appropriate however the higher viscosity of oil as well as higher intrinsic resistance of a hydrophilic surface to oil over that of hydrophobic surface towards water make hydrophilic materials more efficient for oil water separations previous studies on modification of membranes for improving hydrophilicity have used two approaches a use of surface modifications 5 6 and b blending of various hydrophilic additives and fillers 7 to improve fouling resistance surface modification is more beneficial for protein and other natural organic matter fouling rather than oil water separations since the pores themselves may remain hydrophobic after surface treatment and any oil that enters the pores and gets adsorbed will cause further fouling the surface coating adds one of more manufacturing steps and increase the cost of the membranes additionally antifouling coatings may also get eroded over time necessitating re treatment alternatively use of hydrophilic additives during membrane synthesis improves surface as well as bulk hydrophilicity additives reported for improving anti fouling properties include macromolecules 8 12 inorganic nanoparticles 3 13 21 carbon nanomaterials 4 22

not as effective antifouling additive as carbon nanomaterials in macroparticle polymer ultrafiltration composite membranes 26 27 carbon soot on the other hand is naturally formed in nanoparticle form with sizes between 10 80 nm 28 one disadvantage of soot obtained from combustion phenomena contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons some of which are mutagens or carcinogens however studies have confirmed that no pah were detected in the soots from candle wax 29 soot is however naturally superhydrophobic 30 candle soot is hydrophobic with very few oxygen functionality hierarchical morphology with nanoscale roughness when water droplet in contact with soot creates nano sized air gap giving high contact angle and superhydrophobic surface however if the surface becomes hydrophilic the composite interface between solid liquid and air may become unstable and lead to transition to homogeneous interface which is wetting of the surface 31 we therefore derivatized carbon by addition of

estimated by measuring the di water flux the fouled membrane flux and the di water permeate flux recovered after simple flushing permeation experiments were performed using a crossflow permeation cell with an effective membrane area of 10 cm2 at a transmembrane pressure of 1 bar the amount of permeate collected was measured using a weighing balance connected to a computer for automated data

characterization of candle soot and sulphonated candle soot candle soot collected on a stainless steel plate over candle wax flame was sulphonated using in situ generated 4 benzenediazonium sulphonate as shown in scheme in fig 1 a sulphonation was evident on dispersion of candle soot sulphonated candle soot in water candle soot contains limited number of oxygen or heteroatom containing functional groups and is hydrophobic carbon soot deposited from incomplete combustion of paraffin did not disperse in water fig 1 b however candle soot became hydrophilic on sulphonation and dispersed readily in water as shown in fig 1 b indicating hydrophilization the suspension of sulphonated candle soot was stable and did not settle in over 3 weeks fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir of candle soot before and after sulphonation was performed to identify the change in functional groups in the carbon matrix after sulphonation fig 2 the spectra of candle soot does not display many peaks the spectra of sulphonated carbon soot showed peaks at 3520 cm 1 and 3305 cm 1 attributed to hydroxyl groups the peak at 1339 cm 1 can be attributed to so2 asymmetric stretching while the peaks at 1124 5 cm 1 and 1196 cm 1 are due to so2 symmetric stretching the peaks at 1009 cm 1 and 1035 cm 1 correspond to s o stretching the peaks corresponding to c s stretching are found between 555 5 cm 1 and 685 cm 1 confirming sulphonation the elemental composition of scs was estimated using edx analysis giving 9 4 wt sulphur and 14 1 wt oxygen in the matrix esi fig s1 sem analysis revealed spherical candle soot particles of approximate diameter 66 nm while the particle size of scs was approximately 51 nm esi fig s2 bet surface area of the candle soot increased from 81 m2 g to 94 m2 g after sulphonation however the average pore diameter and the pore volume of the soot decreased from 6 nm to 3 nm and 0 52 cm3 g to 0 15 cm3 g after sulphonation respectively the decrease in the pore diameter is likely due to effect of functionalization additionally the evaporation of water during drying after sulphonation may also have contributed to collapse in pores 3 2 characterization of membranes membrane dope solutions were prepared by blending candle soot and sulphonated candle soot with polysulphone in nmp using pvp of average molecular weight of 5 kda as pore forming agent and are shown in table 1 blending of carbon materials in proportion greater than 1 w w solution presented difficulties during homogenization of membrane dope solutions pure polysulfone polymer film will get fouled due to oil proteins and hydrophobic moieties during usage and an increase in the hydrophilicity will minimize fouling during those separations contact angle study of the membranes is presented in fig 3 addition of unmodified candle soot increased the contact angle from 45 for psf pvp control membrane to 55 for cs 0 25 membrane indicating a decrease in hydrophilic character of the membrane on the other hand addition of scs to the membrane matrix increased hydrophilicity of the membranes the contact angle of the membranes decreased with increasing scs content scs 1 0 membranes with 1 sulphonated candle soot in the membrane matrix displayed the lowest contact angle of 31 surface energy δgmw of the synthesized membranes was estimated from the modified form of young dupre equation eq 3 and is presented in table 1 hydrophobic surfaces have lower surface energy while surfaces with higher surface energy are readily wetted by water a more wetting surface with have a higher value of interfacial surface energy the surface energy of cs 0 25 membranes was lowest among the membranes synthesized owing to hydrophobic matrix psf membrane has higher surface energy than cs 0 25 the addition of sulphonated soot resulted in an increase in surface energy as the amount of sulphonated candle soot increased in the dope solution the surface free energy increased scs 1 0 membrane surface had highest surface energy thus addition of hydrophilic matrix increased the surface energy of the membrane and increasing the content of hydrophilic matrix to 1 wt membrane dope solution gave scs 1 0 membranes with highest surface energy and therefore highest wettability overall porosity ε was estimated by measuring the water uptake of the membrane as shown in table 1 presence of sulphonated candle soot in the dope solution enhanced the porosity of the membranes the porosity increased with an increase in the concentration of the sulphonated candle soot from 24 in psf membrane to 35 7 for scs 1 0 membrane during phase inversion mixing of solvent and anti solvent occurs creating instabilities about which the polymer precipitates the presence of insoluble matrices such as carbon soot and sulphonated carbon soot act as nucleation sites for faster precipitation of polymer increase in amount of matrix increases the number of nucleation sites giving membrane with large number of smaller pores and therefore the membranes exhibit higher flux along with good rejection higher porosity commonly results in membranes with lower tensile strength on addition of cs the tensile strength of the membranes increased by about 10 while the addition of scs to the membrane matrix decreased the tensile strength by about 33 and 25 for scs 0 5 and scs 1 0 membranes respectively table 1 in addition to higher porosity the reason for decrease in tensile strength might be due to dissimilar nature of polysulfone and sulphonated candle soot that may have created inhomogeneities in the membrane matrix during phase inversion sem images of the surface of the membranes are presented in fig 4 the surface of the membranes is slightly rough with nearly circular pores for psf the surface of cs 0 25 is rough with presence of very few pores in contrast with the surface of scs 0 25 which shows much higher surface porosity the surface morphology of scs 0 5 scs 0 75 and scs 1 0 was similar to that of scs 0 25 sem images of the cross section of the membranes are also shown in fig 4 the membrane cross sections show rich hierarchical pore structure typical of phase inversion membranes the structure is asymmetric with relatively finely porous top layer while the polymer immediately below the top layer show finger like elongated pores which further transform in to large voids the polymer enclosing the voids and pores is also finely porous afm images of the membranes are shown in fig 4 the root mean square roughness of the surface was estimated from afm topographic information and is presented in table 1 the membranes were quite smooth with the values of the roughness being lower than 100 nm control membrane of psf pvp showed a rms roughness of only 27 6 nm which marginally decreased when carbon soot was added the addition of carbon soot also decreased the contact angle in contrast addition of scs increased surface roughness the roughness increased as the amount of scs in the polymer matrix increased except in the case of 0 75 scs membranes for reasons unknown the roughness observed was lowered higher roughness combined with lower water contact angle resulted in surfaces with high surface energy which increased hydrophilicity 3 3 permeation and fouling characteristics of synthesized membranes the performance of the synthesized membranes was studied for recovery of water from diesel water d w emulsions the membranes were first subjected to bubble point test to identify any defects the membranes studied did not give a bubble point until 10 bar therefore were considered to be free of pin hole defects the membranes were characterized for their di water flux rejection of diesel as well as for the recovery of membrane performance upon flushing with water fig 5 shows the comparison of the di water flux 5 d w emulsion flux and the recovered water flux of psf cs 0 25 scs 0 5 and scs 1 0 membranes pure water flux is shown in the first part of fig 5 the membranes were compacted initially and di water flux was measured subsequently after 2000s of steady flux the feed solution was switched from di water to 5 diesel in water emulsion stabilized by triton x100 the variation of flux during filtration of d w emulsion is shown in the second part of the fig 5 under section emulsion after about 7000 s of emulsion filtration the fouled membranes were flushed with water to remove any diesel adsorbed on the membrane top layer for 10 min at zero transmembrane pressure the feed was then switched to di water again and the permeate flux was monitored at 1 bar transmembrane pressure fig 5 section di water after flushing and is represented as recovered flux the di water flux of scs 0 25 was lowest followed by flux of cs 0 25 and psf while scs 1 0 exhibited highest flux that was about 80 higher than unmodified psf diesel in water emulsion flux of psf cs 0 25 and scs 0 25 was almost the same while that of scs 1 0 was about 100 higher than that of psf both psf cs 0 25 and scs 0 25 got fouled quickly and the flux remained almost constant on the other hand scs 1 0 membranes showed a gradual decrease of flux over approximately 7000 s of 5 d w emulsion filtration other membranes studied had almost reached a steady state within first 1000s of d w emulsion filtration while the permeate flux of d w emulsion showed a decline for scs 1 0 membranes and did not reach a steady state even after 7000 s of crossflow filtration this behaviour provides an evidence of anti fouling property of the scs 1 0 membranes on flushing the membranes with di water a recovery of 36 in the di water permeate flux over fouled flux is obtained for psf cs 0 25 and scs 0 25 while 60 increase in the permeate flux was obtained for scs 1 0 membranes the recovered di water permeate flux of scs 1 0 membranes was 2 35 fold larger compared to that of the control psf membrane after flushing the permeate flux on recovery for cs 0 25 appeared to achieve a steady state at a value that was slightly less than half of the pure water flux of cs 0 25 however other membranes exhibited very gradual decline in di water flux upon flushing the decline was more pronounced in flux of scs 1 0 the decline in di water flux after flushing may be due to irreversible fouling of the membrane by diesel during diesel water emulsion separations the emulsion may remain stable or may break as water is removed if the emulsion remains stable the diesel droplets accumulate near the membrane surface forming a concentration polarization layer on the other hand if the emulsion breaks oil droplets merge forming larger droplets the large and small droplets could either be swept away or could come in contact with the membrane surface forming a film causing fouling the pores of ultrafiltration membrane are much larger than the molecules in diesel and if the pores of the membrane are not hydrophilic oil film and droplets will enter the membrane pores leading to internal fouling however if the membrane pores are hydrophilic capillary forces have to be overcome before oil can enter the pores therefore hydrophilic membranes will display higher fouling resistance to oil fouling during emulsion separation the average particle size of d w emulsions was about 240 nm and is much higher than the pores of the membrane we observed that the emulsion droplet size decreased from an average droplet diameter of 5 5 μm before the beginning of the filtration to about 1 3 μm after the filtration figure s3 higher normalized recovered flux indicated that diesel droplets remained on the surface and did not permeate the pores of the membrane these droplets were swept away during flushing giving a refreshed membrane surface the rejection of d w emulsion was estimated from toc analysis of permeate and diluted feed solutions psf and cs 0 25 exhibited diesel rejection of 97 and 98 respectively while scs containing membranes displayed greater than 99 7 rejection fig 6 since diesel did not permeate the membrane pores the rejection of scs membranes was substantially higher than cs 0 25 and psf membranes presence of minor amount of organic carbon in permeate was likely due to triton x100 that may have dissolved in water and come out in permeate lower rejection of diesel from psf and cs 0 25 membranes signify that some pores were hydrophobic enough to allow ingress of diesel in permeate a comparison of average di water flux 5 d w emulsion flux and recovered di water flux after water flushing and rejection of diesel is plotted in fig 6 di water flux of the membranes with scs content less than 0 75 lower than that of unmodified polysulphone membranes hydrophobic cs 0 25 membranes had lower flux than psf for reasons unclear the flux of scs 0 25 membranes was lower than that of cs 0 25 di water flux increased with increasing scs content with maximum flux displayed by scs 1 0 membranes the permeate flux dropped substantially during filtration of 5 d w emulsion fouled flux was lowest for psf membranes followed by cs 0 25 membranes the fouled flux increased with increase in the of scs in the membrane matrix with the scs 1 0 membranes exhibiting maximum flux which was 240 psf membrane flux on flushing with water the flux of all the membranes recovered to certain extent diesel interacts strongest with candle soot over other materials used in membrane synthesis and likewise cs 0 25 membranes showed lowest improvement in recovered flux indicating that the hydrophobic cs 0 25 membranes with candle soot matrix was fouled intensely 72 of unfouled pure water flux was recovered by simple flushing of scs 1 0 containing membranes was much better than 56 and 49 obtained for psf and cs 0 25 membranes respectively thus incorporation of hydrophilized sulphonated the hydrophilisation of candle soot in membrane matrix leads to development of fouling resistant membranes the effect was more pronounced at high scs concentration the effect of hydrophilicity is apparent when comparing the intrinsic reversible and irreversible resistances of the membranes shown in fig 7 a the intrinsic membrane resistance decreases with increasing scs content while the reversible membrane resistance is very high for cs 0 25 followed by psf membranes scs containing membranes exhibit lower irreversible resistance and among those scs 0 75 membranes had the lowest resistance fig 7b shows a plot of normalized recovered flux plotted against the di water flux a higher flux as well as higher recovered flux is desirable for a membrane for separation of fouling mixtures relatively hydrophobic membranes psf and cs 0 25 are near the bottom left corner indicating poor permeate flux as well as high fouling tendencies while scs 1 0 membrane bore highest flux as well as good recovery in permeate flux after fouling scs 1 0 membranes display higher porosity lower contact angle higher flux higher rejection as well as higher normalized recovered flux more hydrophilic pores combined with more porous scs 1 0 membranes gave highest water permeability j w j f as well as high rejection of diesel increased hydrophilicity on addition of sulphonated candle soot particles also manifested as higher normalized recovered flux as the hydrophobic suspended particles diesel droplets are easily removed from the membrane surface during water flushing most studies that report higher normalized recovered flux have performed fouling studies with much lower oil concentrations 1 while we report flux as high as 156 lmh bar with 5 d w emulsion with over 92 recovery of flux on water flushing 35 36 the performance of scs 1 0 membranes was evaluated for highly fouling feed of 50 diesel water emulsion in addition to 5 diesel water emulsion table 2 the fouling due to 50 diesel water emulsion was significant with resulting long term average fouled flux of about 10 lmh bar the recovered flux was actually lower on flushing the membrane with water which was surprising if is likely that during flushing with water any residual diesel in the membrane got entrenched in the pores exacerbating fouling surfactants or other chemical cleaning agents may be needed to clean such heavily fouled membrane however there have been no other studies reporting such high fouled flux for extreme fouling 50 diesel water emulsion with over 99 98 rejection the reversibility of fouling was also evaluated by carrying out periodic membrane cleaning with flushing during flushing transmembrane pressure was relieved feed was switched to di water and passed over the membrane any layer formed on the membrane due to concentration polarization or external fouling is likely to be flushed away fouling layer that is strongly bound to the membrane will not be removed by flushing the effect of periodic cleaning by water flushing on permeate flux of scs 1 0 membranes was studied and was compared with psf membranes the membranes were subjected to filtration of 5 diesel water emulsion for 20 min followed by forward flushing with di water for 1 min psf membranes quickly become irreversibly fouled during the filtration the flux recovered by flushing psf membranes is minimal giving almost constant flux over 8000 s of filtration as shown in fig 8 scs 1 0 membranes display much larger recovery in the permeate flux after washing over psf membranes scs 1 0 membranes do get fouled gradually with permeate flux decreasing with each successive cycle however the permeate flux recovers to almost the same value on flushing the decline in permeate flux recovery is about 9 over 8000 s therefore scs 1 0 membranes display much higher resistance to irreversible fouling over psf membranes and that the performance can be boosted by simple flushing for a short time 4 conclusion in this work we have synthesized robust hydrophilized polysulfone membranes blending inexpensive particles obtained from candle soot candle soot particles were sulphonated in a one pot reaction and then mixed with polysulphone to give hydrophilic membranes a comparison of effect of sulphonation of candle soot on membrane properties was also carried out the results revealed improved hydrophilic character along with decreased membrane resistance both membrane permeability as well as rejection was improved on addition of sulphonated candle soot in the membrane matrix addition of 1 of sulphonated candle soot resulted in membranes that showed about 1 8 fold increase in water permeability and approximately 2 5 fold improvement in diesel water emulsion flux with greater than 99 7 rejection of diesel scs psf mixed matrix membranes also demonstrated outstanding flux recovery as high as 93 on flushing with deionized water summarizing we have developed a high flux robust polysulfone mixed matrix ultrafiltration membrane with candle soot obtained from candle soot an abundant and inexpensive material which was modified in a single step the synthesized membrane displays outstanding fouling resistance with high degree of reversible fouling that can be reversed by simple flushing with deionized water therefore synthesized membranes will find wide application in separations involving fouling feeds declaration of

introduction as drinking water quality standards being improved through government legislation and regulations and people s requirements for good quality and safe water ensuring the consistent safety of drinking water quality is that many scientists and technologists focus on recently as one of the new green technologies ultrafiltration technology has been widely applied to conventional or advanced drinking water treatment pre membrane pretreatment technology combined with ultrafiltration technology is now being increasingly considered as a new strategy 1 but membrane fouling is the main bottleneck hindering its practical application consequently the approach to reduce membrane fouling and restore good membrane filtration performance has always been a research issue in the field of membrane technologies 2 3 during the process of drinking water treatment ultrafiltration is often combined with other processes which not only improves the removal efficiency of pollutants in the ultrafiltration membrane mechanism but also reduces the rate of membrane fouling caused by pollutants in the water treatment process 4 5 chemically enhanced backwash ceb is an effective approach for reducing membrane fouling i e adding chemical agents in the online hydraulic backwashing of membranes ceb combines physical and chemical cleaning methods to maintain membrane flux and prevent the formation of membrane contaminants 6 however chemically enhanced backwash byproducts cebbps are produced during the ceb process most of them are volatile halogenated hydrocarbons vhoc and haloacetic acids haas 7 and the trihalomethanes thms in volatile halogenated hydrocarbons and haas can cause potential harm to human health 8 nowadays to protect public health human health risk assessment is necessary and meaningful for wastewater treatment especially for drinking water treatment considering that the disinfection of these by products produced during the ceb process will affect the quality of the membrane effluent more attention should be paid to the water quality safety in this study the membrane cleaning operation system was optimized by using the response surface methodology coupled with the interactions of various ceb parameters bd rc bi bf on the cleaning impact of different combined processes furthermore with the ceb optimal cleaning parameter mode a health risk assessment of

9698 respectively the adjusted r2 of the regression equation for al uf pac uf and ozone uf were 0 5409 0 9674 0 9395 respectively the analysis of variance regression and confidence analysis results were displayed in table 4 the results showed that the models of al uf pac uf and ozone uf had significant adaptability p 0 05 and the four cleaning parameters wielded an obvious influence on k the lack of fit was not significant f 0 05 which indicated the other factors exerted only a small level of small interference thus the quadratic models of the combined processes obtained by response surface methodology are feasible 20 the influence of the first order and quadratic terms in the model equation was significant suggesting that a complex linear relationship existed between various factors and response values for the al uf table 4 summarizes the impact of the four factors on the interaction of k as follows ad bc ab ac bd cd among them the influence of ad and bc was more significant the order of influence of single factors on k was as follows d a c b that is the order of influence of the cleaning parameters on the ceb cleaning effect is backwash flux bf backwash duration bd backwash interval bi reagent concentration rc similarly the order of the four factor interactions of k for the pac uf is ac bc cd and the order of effect of the cleaning parameters on the recovery of membrane flux is rc bi bf bd in the ozone uf the order of the four factor interactions affecting the k is cd ab ac and the order of influence of single factor interactionon membrane fouling is bd bi rc bf as shown in table 4 the p values of single factor in the three combined processes are all more than 100 times smaller than that of four factor interaction thus there is a significant difference in the amount of influence of single factor cleaning parameters and four factor interaction this specifically refers to the performances that different combined processes conduct the cleaning process 3 1 2 impact analysis of interaction based on the above results the interaction response surface diagrams of factors for different combined processes were obtained respectively the influence of the interaction of two factors on the k could be specifically analyzed and then the range of optimum ceb cleaning parameters values of the combined process was determined fig 1 illustrates the response surface of interactions between bd and bf ad bi and rc bc on k in the combined process of al uf it could be seen from fig 1 a that the value of k varied parabolically with the change of bf and bd within the experimental value range when bd was 4 min and bf was 20 l m2 h 1 the k value was then minimized meanwhile fig 1 b shows that the response surface changed parabolically with the increase in rc when rc was 14 mg l 1 25 mg l 1 the k value would reach a minimum regardless of whether bi increased or decreased therefore high or low level influencing factors are not conducive to reducing the k value rational adjustment of ceb cleaning parameters under multi factor conditions can achieve effective mitigation of membrane fouling according to the above results the final optimization scheme is bd 4 min rc 29 mg l 1 bi 60 min bf 23 l m2 h 1 fig 2 reveals the response surface of interactions between bd and bi ac rc and bi bc bi and bf cd on k in the combined process of pac uf fig 2 a shows that within the range of test values k tended to be a minimum when bd was 5 9 min 6 3 min and bi was in the range of 60 min 90 min moreover fig 2 b illustrates the parabolic trend of k as rc increased and k reached a minimum when rc was 55 mg l 1 to 75 mg l 1 as shown in fig 2 c k decreased as bf increased and when bf was 35 l m2 h 1 to 40 l m2 h 1 k reached the minimum value meanwhile within that interval bi exerted virtually no effect on the value of k in order to ensure the effectiveness of membrane cleaning when using the combined process of pac uf the best solution for ceb cleaning parameters is bd 6 min rc 69 mg l 1 bi 60 min bf 40 l m2 h 1 the response surfaces for the interactions of bi and bf cd bd and bi ac rc and bd ab on k in the combined process of ozone uf are depicted in fig 3 fig 3 a shows that the k changed parabolically with the change of bd and bi where the value of k can be minimized when bf is 7 min 15 min and bi is 60 min 130 min similarly fig 3 b indicated that the membrane cleaning effect was best when bd was 2 5 min 3 min and bi was 60 min 90 min fig 3 c shows that the response surface was the lowest when bd was 2 min 3 min and rc was in the range of 28 mg l 1 40 mg l 1 according to the experimental results the optimal ceb scheme for the combined process of ozone uf is bd 2 5 min rc 40 mg l 1 bi 93 min bf 15 l m2 h 1 3 2 health risk assessment of cebbps the results for the detection of the cebbps concentration the non carcinogenic health risk hi and carcinogenic health risk ri of byproducts in effluent of each combined process based on the optimal cleaning parameters are shown in table 5 the results show that the concentration of cebbps in the effluent of the pac uf process was higher than that in the al uf process this is because the former had a longer backwash duration higher reagent concentration and larger backwash flux which resulted in a higher amount of cleaning agent into the reactor during the ceb than that in the al uf process however as shown in fig 4 the concentration of cebbps in the ozone uf process effluent was as high as 424 21 μg l 1 which was much higher than that of al uf 46 31 μg l 1 and pac uf 172 94 μg l 1 this indicates that the ozone s control of organic matter is less than that of coagulation and adsorption in the three pretreatment processes the haas accounted for more than 80 of cebbps in the effluent of combined processes indicating that haas were the main byproducts in the effluent after ceb moreover table 5 shows that haas in cebbps of the three combined processes led to higher non carcinogenic risk while vhoc12 and thms posed less risk which was directly related to the smaller concentration of vhoc in the effluent the hi of the three combined process cebbps was less than 1 indicating that with optimal ceb parameters the concentration level of cebbps in the combined process effluent do not pose a non carcinogenic risk through drinking or skin absorption in this paper the carcinogenic risk levels of various types of cebbps in the al uf and pac uf processes were less than 1 00 10 5 and their ri levels of haas 1 38 10 6 6 68 10 6 were close to the total levels of cebbps 1 40 10 6 6 78 10 6 thus the cebbps concentrations of the two combined processes do not pose a carcinogenic risk however although the lcr level of each type of cebbps in the ozone uf process effluent was less than 1 00 10 5 the ri levels of haas and cebbps were all greater than 1 00 10 5 consequently the effluent after ceb in this combined process may entail carcinogenic risks the risk level caused by haas accounts for more than 95 which proves haas in the effluent of ozone uf are the main factors that pose potential carcinogenic risks to the human body since the non carcinogenic and concentration risks of ozone uf effluent are higher than the other two combined processes its potential health risks of water quality should be noted to ensure water quality safety the concentration of cebbps in ozone uf effluent could be reduced by sludge removal after backwashing adjusting the operating parameters or combining with other processes electro fenton photocatalysis etc 4 conclusions the following summary was made on the basis of the research findings in this study firstly based on the single factor test the response surface methodology was used to study the interaction between the cleaning parameters bd bi rc bf in the ceb process the mathematical model developed for the cleaning parameters concerning the membrane pressure difference growth rate k was obtained and the optimization model was proved to be reliable according to the quadratic response surface models the optimal ceb cleaning parameters for the three combined processes were obtained secondly with the optimal ceb parameters the total concentration of cebbps in the effluent of al uf pac uf and ozone uf processes increased in turn which was due to the different operating parameters of the three combined processes and the different levels of effectiveness of the pretreatment process on organic matter the main byproducts in the ceb effluent of each combined process were haas thirdly the health risk assessment showed that the cebbps of al uf and pac uf process did not emerge as non carcinogenic or carcinogenic risks through drinking or skin absorption however the cebbps of the ozone uf combined process had potential carcinogenic risks and both types of risk values were higher than the first two combined processes moreover the risks were mainly owing to haas in future more attention should be paid to the potential water quality health risks of the ozone uf effluent it is necessary to continue working on developing an efficient and effective process with good operating parameters or adding other processes so that the concentration of cebbps in the effluent can be reduced declaration of competing interest the authors report no

introduction as drinking water quality standards being improved through government legislation and regulations and people s requirements for good quality and safe water ensuring the consistent safety of drinking water quality is that many scientists and technologists focus on recently as one of the new green technologies ultrafiltration technology has been widely applied to conventional or advanced drinking water treatment pre membrane pretreatment technology combined with ultrafiltration technology is now being increasingly considered as a new strategy 1 but membrane fouling is the main bottleneck hindering its practical application consequently the approach to reduce membrane fouling and restore good membrane filtration performance has always been a research issue in the field of membrane technologies 2 3 during the process of drinking water treatment ultrafiltration is often combined with other processes which not only improves the removal efficiency of pollutants in the ultrafiltration membrane mechanism but also reduces the rate of membrane fouling caused by pollutants in the water treatment process 4 5 chemically enhanced backwash ceb is an effective approach for reducing membrane fouling i e adding chemical agents in the online hydraulic backwashing of membranes ceb combines physical and chemical cleaning methods to maintain membrane flux and prevent the formation of membrane contaminants 6 however chemically enhanced backwash byproducts cebbps are produced during the ceb process most of them are volatile halogenated hydrocarbons vhoc and haloacetic acids haas 7 and the trihalomethanes thms in volatile halogenated hydrocarbons and haas can cause potential harm to human health 8 nowadays to protect public health human health risk assessment is necessary and meaningful for wastewater treatment especially for drinking water treatment considering that the disinfection of these by products produced during the ceb process will affect the quality

was 2 min 3 min and rc was in the range of 28 mg l 1 40 mg l 1 according to the experimental results the optimal ceb scheme for the combined process of ozone uf is bd 2 5 min rc 40 mg l 1 bi 93 min bf 15 l m2 h 1 3 2 health risk assessment of cebbps the results for the detection of the cebbps concentration the non carcinogenic health risk hi and carcinogenic health risk ri of byproducts in effluent of each combined process based on the optimal cleaning parameters are shown in table 5 the results show that the concentration of cebbps in the effluent of the pac uf process was higher than that in the al uf process this is because the former had a longer backwash duration higher reagent concentration and larger backwash flux which resulted in a higher amount of cleaning agent into the reactor during the ceb than that in the al uf process however as shown in fig 4 the concentration of cebbps in the ozone uf process effluent was as high as 424 21 μg l 1 which was much higher than that of al uf 46 31 μg l 1 and pac uf 172 94 μg l 1 this indicates that the ozone s control of organic matter is less than that of coagulation and adsorption in the three pretreatment processes the haas accounted for more than 80 of cebbps in the effluent of combined processes indicating that haas were the main byproducts in the effluent after ceb moreover table 5 shows that haas in cebbps of the three combined processes led to higher non carcinogenic risk while vhoc12 and thms posed less risk which was directly related to the smaller concentration of vhoc in the effluent the hi of the three combined process cebbps was less than 1 indicating that with optimal ceb parameters the concentration level of cebbps in the combined process effluent do not pose a non carcinogenic risk through drinking or skin absorption in this paper the carcinogenic risk levels of various types of cebbps in the al uf and pac uf processes were less than 1 00 10 5 and their ri levels of haas 1 38 10 6 6 68 10 6 were close to the total levels of cebbps 1 40 10 6 6 78 10 6 thus the cebbps concentrations of the two combined processes do not pose a carcinogenic risk however although the lcr level of each type of cebbps in the ozone uf process effluent was less than 1 00 10 5 the ri levels of haas and cebbps were all greater than 1 00 10 5 consequently the effluent after ceb in this combined process may entail carcinogenic risks the risk level caused by haas accounts for more than 95 which proves haas in the effluent of ozone uf are the main factors that pose potential carcinogenic risks to the human body since the non carcinogenic and concentration risks of ozone uf effluent are higher than the other two combined processes its potential health risks of water quality should be noted to ensure water quality safety the concentration of cebbps in ozone uf effluent could be reduced by sludge removal after backwashing adjusting the operating parameters or combining with other processes electro fenton photocatalysis etc 4 conclusions the following summary was made on the basis of the research findings in this study firstly based on the single factor test the response surface methodology was used to study the interaction between the cleaning parameters bd bi rc bf in the ceb process the mathematical model developed for the cleaning parameters concerning the membrane pressure difference growth rate k was obtained and the optimization model was proved to be reliable according to the quadratic response surface models the optimal ceb cleaning parameters for the three combined processes were obtained secondly with the optimal ceb parameters the total concentration of cebbps in the effluent of al uf pac uf and ozone uf processes increased in turn which was due to the different operating parameters of the three combined processes and the different levels of effectiveness of the pretreatment process on organic matter the main byproducts in the ceb effluent of each combined process were haas thirdly the health risk assessment showed that the cebbps of al uf and pac uf process did not emerge as non carcinogenic or carcinogenic risks through drinking or skin absorption however the cebbps of the ozone uf combined process had potential carcinogenic risks and both types of risk values were higher than the first two combined processes moreover the risks were mainly owing to haas in future more attention should be paid to the potential water quality health risks of the ozone uf effluent it is necessary to continue working on developing an efficient and effective process with good operating parameters or adding other processes so that the concentration of cebbps in the effluent can be reduced declaration of competing interest the authors report no

13788,in this work the efficiency of micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf was evaluated for the recovery of polyphenols and polysaccharides from winery wastewaters ww using a cationic surfactant esterquat firstly the critical micellar concentration cmc of esterquat was determined at three ph levels and the membrane was characterized besides the effect of several operating variables surfactant concentration solution ph the complexity of the solution and the solution concentration on polyphenols and polysaccharides rejection percentages r was investigated as well as the understanding of the fouling mechanism dependent on solution ph the highest rejection efficiency was obtained for a surfactant concentration of 5 5 cmc regarding the influence of initial ph it was observed that the initial permeate flux decreases significantly with the increase of the ph value from the fitting of classical hermia s models to the experimental data of the flux against time it was found that the fouling mechanism is characterized by the complete pore blocking for all the tested ph values the polyphenols rejection increased with the ph up to 5 0 but at higher ph values a lower r value was

introduction the wine industry is one of the most relevant socio economic activities in the world 1 and in 2019 there was a production of 290 million hl of wine 2 however there are several environmental challenges associated with winemaking activity such as a large amount of wastewater and the production of massive quantities of wastes in a short period of time due to its associated seasonality 1 3 4 the winery wastewaters ww are the result of various washing operations at the different stages of winemaking 3 6 commonly most of ww are discharged into municipal sewage treatment plants or used to irrigate the agricultural land however these types of practices have an enormous negative impact on the environment leading to degradation of soil and crop damage due to the high organic load low ph and high content of phytotoxic and anti bacterial substances 3 7 9 the high organic load of ww is attributed among other compounds to the presence of polyphenols and polysaccharides 10 11 polyphenols have been known for their excellent antioxidant properties thus recently different wastes have become an attractive natural source of phenolic compounds for the food pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries 12 13 the polysaccharides released from the degradation of the pectin present in the cell walls of grapes can also be used as a substrate for biological processes due to their low toxicity and high biodegradability 1 5 considering the ww composition this type of effluent becomes an important source of natural phenolic compounds and polysaccharides in the last decades polysaccharides have been recovered mainly by chromatography techniques and anion exchange methods 10 while the recovery of phenolic compounds recovery from wastes has been performed through extractions namely solvent extraction supercritical fluid extraction and freeze drying 13 15 however these techniques are recognized for their high operating costs and in the case of the extraction methods for the use of large amounts of solvents compared with traditional separation methods membrane technology such as microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro has become a promising technology for the recovery of value added compounds from a liquid matrix 16 18 ro and nf are suitable techniques for the retention of low molecular weight molecules such as polyphenols however these processes are characterized by a low permeate flux and high cake formation and membrane fouling making this an expensive method for the recovery of value added products 13 16 ultrafiltration has been widely explored to recover and separate polyphenols and polysaccharides while very low molecular weight polysaccharides can permeate the membrane which causes a low degree of separation between phenolic compounds and polysaccharides 4 10 16 17 micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf has been explored as alternative membrane technology for the recovery of phenolic compounds from wastewaters 13 16 meuf is based on mixing the solute containing stream with a surfactant in concentrations above its critical micellar concentration cmc the micelle formation allows the solubilization of certain organic compounds due to the size of the micelles they can be rejected by the membrane allowing the retention of the organic compounds associated with them in this case phenolic compounds 19 however most of the surfactants are discharged in the sewage after their use causing some serious environmental issues on the contrary due to their environmentally friendly properties esterquats have become a promising alternative in order to substitute some common cationic surfactants 20 21 thus meuf using an esterquat as a cationic surfactant might be an alternative to overcome the above mentioned limitations of conventional uf despite the mentioned advantages low pressure simple operation and high separation efficiency the use of surfactants can cause a decrease in the permeate flux as a result of membrane fouling 22 according to the literature a possible approach to describe the membrane fouling is based on four distinct mechanisms pore constriction cake formation intermediate blocking and complete blocking 23 24 this approach was used in the present study to model the meuf experiments to gain insights into the best operating conditions and how to overcome scale up restrictions 22 recently meuf has been applied to separate different organic compounds and contaminants 25 28 for example meuf was applied to olive mill wastewaters and the results revealed the potential of this membrane technology regarding the recovery of phenolic compounds 13 16 however to the best of our knowledge micellar enhanced ultrafiltration has not been explored for the recovery of phenolic compounds from winery wastewaters therefore the present work aims to study the efficiency of meuf for the separation of phenolic compounds and polysaccharides from winery wastewater the influence and the optimization of some operating parameters such as the cationic surfactant concentration ph matrix complexity and solute concentration on the rejection separation coefficient as well as the effect of ph on the membrane fouling were investigated through model solutions finally the optimum operating conditions were applied in the micellar enhanced ultrafiltration of real winery wastewater to the best of our knowledge no similar study to this work has been carried out with the objective of maximizing the selective recovery of polysaccharides and phenolic compounds through the micellar enhanced ultrafiltration process testing not only model solutions but also wastewater from real wineries 2 materials and methods 2 1 winery wastewater and chemicals in this study winery wastewater ww from the production of red wine was collected in a local producer the center region of portugal and frozen until further use based on the ww characterization four model solutions were prepared to assess important factors influencing the meuf process 100 mg l 1 gallic acid solution ga 250 mg l 1 of glucose glc 100 mg l 1 gallic acid and 250 mg l 1 glucose solution ga glc and a mixture of phenolic acids 50 mg l 1 of gallic acid 25 mg l 1 of vanillic acid 25 mg l 1 of protocatechuic acid and 250 mg l 1 of glucose mpa glc the model solution components such as gallic acid 98 vanillic acid 97 protocatechuic acid 97 and glucose 99 were supplied by alfa aesar acros organics sigma aldrich and scharlab respectively the cationic surfactant esterquat sodium hydroxide 99 and hydrochloric acid 37 were purchased respectively from panreac eka chemicals and fisher chemical 2 2 surface tension measurements different concentration levels of surfactant solutions 10 100 mg l 1 were prepared by dissolving the surfactant esterquat in double distilled water millipore and tested the surface tension measurements were performed at room temperature with a krüss processor tensiometer k100 germany using the ring method these measurements allowed the determination of the critical micelle concentration cmc 2 3 micellar enhanced ultrafiltration experiments micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf experiments were carried out at room temperature near to 20 c in a 200 ml stirred ultrafiltration cell represented in fig 1 amicon 8200 millipore usa an ultrafiltration flat sheet polyethersulfone membrane of 10 kda nadir up010 p germany and with an effective area s of 28 7 cm2 was used the feed solutions were mixed and homogenized before each meuf experiment stirring was set at 100 rpm and the transmembrane pressure was regulated with a manometer and set to 4 bar the membrane separation efficiency for the recovery of phenolic compounds from the feed solution was evaluated through the rejection coefficient r described by the following equation 1 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp and cf are the concentrations of the compounds of interest in the permeate and feed streams respectively the ph control of the solution was conducted using 0 1 m hcl or naoh as required after each test the membranes were cleaned with a 5 w v ultrasil solution and the permeability determined to guarantee the same conditions in successive tests the hydraulic membrane permeability lp and the membrane resistance rm were determined through eqs 2 and 3 29 2 l p j 0 δp 3 r m 1 l p μ 0 where μ0 is the dynamic viscosity of the water at room temperature 1 10 3 pa s the fouling mechanism during the meuf of ga was evaluated through hermia s models these models were developed for dead end filtration at constant pressure and are based on the following equation 23 24 4 d 2 t dv 2 k dt dv m where k is the constant kinetics parameter and m is the constant associated with the fouling mechanism m 0 cake filtration m 3 2 pore constriction m 1 intermediate blocking and m 2 complete blocking 2 4 analytical techniques chemical oxygen demand cod was determined according to standard methods 30 total phenolic concentration tph was quantified following the folin ciocalteu method 31 using gallic acid as a standard the phenol sulfuric acid method 32 was utilized to determine the total polysaccharides concentration tps using glucose as a standard uv vis measurements were carried out using a pg instruments t6 uv vis spectrophotometer england at 765 nm and 490 nm for tph and tps determination respectively the conductivity and ph measurements of the samples were assessed with a consort c1020 multi parameter analyser belgium 3 results and discussion 3 1 winery wastewater characterization the physico chemical properties of interest in the winery wastewater ww are summarized in table 1 along with the portuguese legal limits for discharge industrial wastewaters in natural water bodies ww is characterized by an acidic ph 3 4 which is the consequence of the organic acids formed during the wine fermentation stage 33 the organic load is about 9125 mg o2 l 1 and is a result of the presence of ethanol sugars and polyphenols in these wastewaters 33 indeed the ww is rich in phenolic compounds 98 5 6 2 mg l 1 and polysaccharides 247 7 2 9 mg l 1 which have great potential for further valorization table 1 shows that not only ph of ww is out of the legally acceptable range but also cod and phenols are much higher than the legal threshold acceptable for an effluent discharge to the natural water courses in case that the effluent from a winery plant is treated in a domestic wastewater treatment plant wwtp the threshold of cod is 125 mg o2 l 1 although ww composition is variable depending on several factors such as the season type of wine and the train of operations similar ww characteristics have been reported in the literature 33 34 3 2 cmc empirical determination of the selected surfactant the critical micelle concentration cmc of the cationic surfactant esterquat in water at three ph levels 2 0 5 0 and 8 0 was determined through surface tension measurements the variation of the surface tension with the concentration of the surfactant is illustrated in fig 2 the cmc is determined from the intersection between the linear regression of the two regions pre and post cmc 35 as can be observed in fig 2 the cmc of esterquat is lower in an acidic medium ph 2 0 which means that a lower surfactant concentration is needed to form micelles the cmc obtained in this study at ph 5 0 and 8 0 54 8 and 54 0 mg l 1 respectively are similar to the values reported using distilled water 13 it is important to note that esterquat is an environmentally friendly cationic surfactant in which an ester bond is located between the quaternary ammonium groups head and the hydrocarbon tail 20 under alkaline conditions the ester groups due to the adjacent quaternary ammonium group become extremely susceptible to hydrolysis 36 as a consequence the stability of esterquat becomes extremely dependent on the medium ph where higher stability is found at acidic ph as stable condition favors the micelle formation the cmc is expected to be lower less surfactant is required at acidic conditions 20 36 37 3 3 membrane characterization the distilled water permeation flux j0 was measured and plotted in fig 3 as a function of the transmembrane pressure δp a linear correlation r2 0 9953 between j0 and δp can be observed in this study when the ultrafiltration was conducted with distilled water an lp of 42 09 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was calculated which is similar to the value indicated by the manufacturer of the membrane 50 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the membrane resistance determined was 8 55 1012 m 1 before each experiment the membrane was always submitted to a cleaning step and the permeability lp was determined to ensure the same initial experimental conditions 3 4 micellar enhanced ultrafiltration of winery wastewater in the first stage the meuf studies involved not only the analysis of the effect of the surfactant concentration on the rejection of gallic acid but also the effect of ph on the membrane fouling mechanism and the rejection coefficient then synthetic solutions of multi component were considered to analyze the effect of the concentration aiming to recover polyphenols the study ends by testing a real effluent in particular to assess the efficiency of the polyphenols and polysaccharides separation 3 4 1 effect of cationic surfactant concentration the effect of the esterquat concentrations 0 1 3 5 5 and 10 cmc on the rejection r of total phenolic content present in ga solution at four ph levels 2 0 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 was studied and the results are summarized in fig 4 in the case of the ga ultrafiltration without surfactant 0 cmc it was observed that the rejection is very low between 3 6 and 6 2 at all the four ph levels studied these results were expected since the molecular weight of gallic acid 170 g mol 1 is significantly lower than the membrane cut off 10 kda resulting in an easier transport of the solute through the membrane which leads to a low solute rejection once the surfactant concentration is equal to the critical micellar concentration 1cmc it is possible to observe an increase in the solute rejection but this effect is more pronounced for the ga solution at ph 5 0 increasing from 6 2 to 29 1 than for the other ph levels the results show the benefit of meuf compared to the conventional uf regarding the removal of phenolic compounds however a reduction in the permeate flow of 68 from 154 to 49 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was observed with the addition of the cationic surfactant due to the fouling phenomenon other studies also reported by similar results 13 16 due to the higher surfactant concentration in the feed there is an increase in the number of micelles leading to a higher solubility of the solute in the micelles 13 16 in fact in all tests it is possible to verify that the rejection reaches the maximum at a concentration of 5 5 cmc therefore 5 5 cmc was considered the optimal surfactant concentration among those studied and was applied in the subsequent experiments 3 4 2 effect of initial ph in this study the fouling mechanism is responsible for the flux decline during the meuf of ga and this phenomenon was evaluated through hermia s models to evaluate the ph effect on the fouling mechanism three ph levels were tested 3 0 5 0 and 9 0 at constant surfactant concentration 5 5 cmc the results are shown in fig 5 and the model s parameters are summarized in table 2 the results show that ph has a great influence on the flux values of ga through the membrane as can be seen in fig 5 the initial permeate flux decreases significantly with the increase of the solution ph in fact there is a reduction of 86 in the permeate flux when the ph changes from 3 0 to 5 0 the reduction of the permeate flux is directly associated with an increase in the fouling of the membrane according to boussu et al 38 the fouling is affected by both solution ph and surfactant nature in the case of a cationic surfactant the least fouling is observed at low ph as the present study suggests although the permeate flux is greatly affected by the solution ph the observed fouling mechanism is the same as can be seen in table 2 the complete pore blocking describes perfectly r2 1 0000 the fouling mechanism of all meuf experiments the optimized values found of parameter kcb are 53 1 19 9 and 19 2 h 1 for ph 3 0 5 0 and 9 0 respectively the kcb value decreases inversely with the increase in membrane pore blockage when the ph changes from 3 0 to 5 0 the surfactant micelles could be deposited on the membrane surface or even into its pores causing complete blocking an effective cleaning method is a key factor when it comes to process efficiency and membrane durability furthermore the solution ph can affect the solubility of natural phenolic compounds in surfactant micelles 16 and consequently the meuf efficiency thus several experiments were performed with ph adjustments from ph 2 0 to ph 9 0 of the ga solution with a surfactant concentration of 5 5 cmc the results obtained are shown in fig 6 the results demonstrate a low rejection coefficient 20 at ph 2 0 3 0 and 4 0 while a significant increase in r occurs at ph 5 0 according to radalla 39 the gallic acid has the first dissociation constant at ph 4 1 were a proton from the carboxylic group cooh is ionized which may contribute to enhance the interaction with the cationic surfactant polar head above ph 6 0 the r values start to decrease from 59 3 30 8 analogous results have been reported 13 16 the maximum rejection coefficient 60 2 was reached at ph 5 0 and therefore considered in subsequent experiments similar rejection coefficients were reported in works where a cationic surfactant was used 40 3 4 3 effect of multi component solutions as the objective of this study is to optimize the performance of the meuf to be further applied to a real effluent with a complex matrix it is necessary to evaluate the effect of this complexity in the rejection coefficient of phenolic compounds accordingly as already mentioned in section 2 1 in addition to the ga solution three other solutions glc ga glc and mpa glc were tested at 4 bar of transmembrane pressure at ph 5 0 and with a concentration of 5 5 esterquat cmc the results are depicted in fig 7 in fig 7 is evident that the glucose glc rejection coefficient is significantly lower when compared to the rejection of gallic acid ga contrary to what happened with the ga solution when the uf of the glc solution was performed it was possible to observe that the effect of the addition of surfactant was almost insignificant r changes from 7 to 9 with 0cmc and 5 5cmc respectively indicating that the glucose does not dissolve into the surfactant micelles in fact the results of the ga glc meuf showed that the phenolic rejection coefficient is essentially the same 59 9 whereas a slight decrease occurs in the r of glucose 5 0 the results demonstrate that the presence of glucose does not have a negative impact on the recovery of phenolic compounds therefore the surfactant mainly interacts with the polyphenols these results also reveal that is possible to successfully separate the two components the meuf experiments of a mixture of phenolic acids gallic vanillic and protocatechuic and glucose mpa glc resulted in a lower phenolic rejection r 52 2 and a slightly higher glucose rejection 9 9 when compared to the results obtained for the ga glc solution this lower rejection rate shows that the interaction between the surfactant and the polyphenols is also dependent on the chemical nature of these compounds the degree of hydrophobicity of the phenolic compounds determines their solubilization in the esterquat micelles causing different rejection values indeed purkait et al 19 demonstrated that such interactions are dependent on the ionic characteristics of phenolic compounds thus it is possible to conclude that the degree of separation between phenolic compounds and glucose decreases with the increase of the matrix complexity 3 4 4 effect of the solution concentration the effects of the initial concentration of mpa glc on the phenolic and glucose rejection coefficient were studied under the optimal condition determined in the previous sections with the results shown in fig 8 both phenolic acids and glucose retentions decrease as the concentration in the feed solution increases similar results were observed in other studies 19 since micelle concentration is constant in the feed 5 5cmc the solubilization capacity of the micelles is also constant the addition of solute in the feed above the solubilization capacity of the micelles will result in a higher insolubilized solute concentration leading to a higher concentration of solute in the permeate reducing the observed retention 19 the results show a higher separation when the feed solution is composed of 50 mg l 1 of phenolic acids and 125 mg l 1 of glucose where r is 78 1 and 19 5 for phenolic compounds and glucose respectively the optimal conditions determined in the previous sections for model solutions 4 bar 5 5cmc ph 5 0 and the solute concentration were applied to ww real winery wastewater to assess the efficiency of the polyphenols and polysaccharides separation the main results are summarized in table 3 the treatment of real winery wastewater by meuf resulted in a high decrease of tph and tps which means high r thus the initial organic load in the permeate also reduces about 80 of the initial cod indeed polyphenols and polysaccharides are the main contributors to the organic load of ww 33 34 the rejection coefficient of the phenolic compounds is 78 3 which is similar to the values obtained for the model solutions 78 1 however there is an increase in the rejection coefficient of polysaccharides 47 3 compared to the value previously obtained 19 5 this increase in retention occurs due to the presence of high molecular weight polysaccharides 180 260 kda in ww 41 when compared to the cut off of the membrane 10 kda to obtain a greater separation between polyphenols and polysaccharides conventional ultrafiltration must be carried out before meuf the conventional uf will allow the permeation of phenolic compounds and the retention of the high molecular weight polysaccharides the micellar enhanced ultrafiltration of a wastewater from a wine industry exhibited interesting results when it comes to the recovery of phenolic compounds in fact the obtained results are within the range reported by others when using other common technologies in various types wastewaters table 4 for valorization purposes of the phenolic compounds as bioactive agents the retentate of the meuf process should be subjected to downstream operations which necessarily include fractionation and purifications steps initially the recovery of the surfactant for reuse allowing the separation of a mixture of polyphenols must be carried out thus the precipitation of the surfactant can be promoted using for example a calcium salt under appropriate conditions the micelles sequester calcium ions releasing the phenolic species resulting in the precipitation of the surfactant in order to fractionate the phenolic mixture some selective ion exchange resins can be applied the selective recovery of the target phenols is achieved in the elution step of the resins through suitable solvents 3 4 5 techno economic assessment of meuf the practical application of the studied technology requires an evaluation of its techno economic viability when tested at industrial scale meuf process must be scaled up by maintaining constant the permeate volume to membrane surface area ratio membrane material and pore size and filtrate pressure a configuration with multiple membrane modules in series should be employed for the processing of large amounts of wastewater the process economy depends on the following costs i membrane fabrication cost ii scale up investment involving pumps valves energy consumption and depreciation cost and 3 operational costs including maintenance and utility costs the membrane fouling causing periodic cleanings and its replacement is a significant limitation to the economic viability of the large scale process another important limitation is the surfactant recovery that can be reused in the filtration process there are still economic and environmental issues to be overcome for the use of the mef technique in large scale applications 4 conclusions this work showed that the rejection of polyphenols and polysaccharides from simulated winery wastewater ww by meuf is affected by some operating variables cationic surfactant concentration ph composition of ww the rejection of gallic acid ga was maximum for 5 5 cmc of the surfactant esterquat the ph has a significant effect on the initial flux and a reduction of 86 was observed when it increased from 3 0 to 5 0 the fouling mechanism was characterized by the complete pore blocking model ga rejection increased with an increase of ph up to 5 which was considered the optimal value the rejection of ga was not affected by the presence of glucose and its separation is feasible through meuf however the degree of separation between phenolic compounds and glucose depends on the matrix complexity the results for real ww showed a rejection of 78 3 for phenolic compounds and 47 3 for polysaccharides the work demonstrated that meuf is a promisor approach for the valorization of ww declaration of competing

phenolic compounds from wastewaters 13 16 meuf is based on mixing the solute containing stream with a surfactant in concentrations above its critical micellar concentration cmc the micelle formation allows the solubilization of certain organic compounds due to the size of the micelles they can be rejected by the membrane allowing the retention of the organic compounds associated with them in this case phenolic compounds 19 however most of the surfactants are discharged in the sewage after their use causing some serious environmental issues on the contrary due to their environmentally friendly properties esterquats have become a promising alternative in order to substitute some common cationic surfactants 20 21 thus meuf using an esterquat as a cationic surfactant might be an alternative to overcome the above mentioned limitations of conventional uf despite the mentioned advantages low pressure simple operation and high separation efficiency the use of surfactants can cause a decrease in the permeate flux as a result of membrane fouling 22 according to the literature a possible approach to describe the membrane fouling is based on four distinct mechanisms pore constriction cake formation intermediate blocking and complete blocking 23 24 this approach was used in the present study to model the meuf experiments to gain insights into the best operating conditions and how to overcome scale up restrictions 22 recently meuf has been applied to separate different organic compounds and contaminants 25 28 for example meuf was applied to olive mill wastewaters and the results revealed the potential of this membrane technology regarding the recovery of phenolic compounds 13 16 however to the best of our knowledge micellar enhanced ultrafiltration has not been explored for the recovery of phenolic compounds from winery wastewaters therefore the present work aims to study the efficiency of meuf for the separation of phenolic compounds and polysaccharides from winery wastewater the influence and the optimization of some operating parameters such as the cationic surfactant concentration ph matrix complexity and solute concentration on the rejection separation coefficient as well as the effect of ph on the membrane fouling were investigated through model solutions finally the optimum operating conditions were applied in the micellar enhanced ultrafiltration of real winery wastewater to the best of our knowledge no similar study to this work has been carried out with the objective of maximizing the selective recovery of polysaccharides and phenolic compounds through the micellar enhanced ultrafiltration process testing not only model solutions but also wastewater from real wineries 2 materials and methods 2 1 winery wastewater and chemicals in this study winery wastewater ww from the production of red wine was collected in a local producer the center region of portugal and frozen until further use based on the ww characterization four model solutions were prepared to assess important factors influencing the meuf process 100 mg l 1 gallic acid solution ga 250 mg l 1 of glucose glc 100 mg l 1 gallic acid and 250 mg l 1 glucose solution ga glc and a mixture of phenolic acids 50 mg l 1 of gallic acid 25 mg l 1 of vanillic acid 25 mg l 1 of protocatechuic acid and 250 mg l 1 of glucose mpa glc the model solution components such as gallic acid 98 vanillic acid 97 protocatechuic acid 97 and glucose 99 were supplied by alfa aesar acros organics sigma aldrich and scharlab respectively the cationic surfactant esterquat sodium hydroxide 99 and hydrochloric acid 37 were purchased respectively from panreac eka chemicals and fisher chemical 2 2 surface tension measurements different concentration levels of surfactant solutions 10 100 mg l 1 were prepared by dissolving the surfactant esterquat in double distilled water millipore and tested the surface tension measurements were performed at room temperature with a krüss processor tensiometer k100 germany using the ring method these measurements allowed the determination of the critical micelle concentration cmc 2 3 micellar enhanced ultrafiltration experiments micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf experiments were carried out at room temperature near to 20 c in a 200 ml stirred ultrafiltration cell represented in fig 1 amicon 8200 millipore usa an ultrafiltration flat sheet polyethersulfone membrane of 10 kda nadir up010 p germany and with an effective area s of 28 7 cm2 was used the feed solutions were mixed and homogenized before each meuf experiment stirring was set at 100 rpm and the transmembrane pressure was regulated with a manometer and set to 4 bar the membrane separation efficiency for the recovery of phenolic compounds from the feed solution was evaluated through the rejection coefficient r described by the following equation 1 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp and cf are the concentrations of the compounds of interest in the permeate and feed streams respectively the ph control of the solution was conducted using 0 1 m hcl or naoh as required after each test the membranes were cleaned with a 5 w v ultrasil solution and the permeability determined to guarantee the same conditions in successive tests the hydraulic membrane permeability lp and the membrane resistance rm were determined through eqs 2 and 3 29 2 l p j 0 δp 3 r m 1 l p μ 0 where μ0 is the dynamic viscosity of the water at room temperature 1 10 3 pa s the fouling mechanism during the meuf of ga was evaluated through hermia s models these models were developed for dead end filtration at constant pressure and are based on the following equation 23 24 4 d 2 t dv 2 k dt dv m where k is the constant kinetics parameter and m is the constant associated with the fouling mechanism m 0 cake filtration m 3 2 pore constriction m 1 intermediate blocking and m 2 complete blocking 2 4 analytical techniques chemical oxygen demand cod was determined according to standard methods 30 total phenolic concentration tph was quantified following the folin ciocalteu method 31 using gallic acid as a standard the phenol sulfuric acid method 32 was utilized to determine the total polysaccharides concentration tps using glucose as a standard uv vis measurements were carried out using a pg instruments t6 uv vis spectrophotometer england at 765 nm and 490 nm for tph and tps determination respectively the conductivity and ph measurements of the samples were assessed with a consort c1020 multi parameter analyser belgium 3 results and discussion 3 1 winery wastewater characterization the physico chemical properties of interest in the winery wastewater ww are summarized in table 1 along with the portuguese legal limits for discharge industrial wastewaters in natural water bodies ww is characterized by an acidic ph 3 4 which is the consequence of the organic acids formed during the wine fermentation stage 33 the organic load is about 9125 mg o2 l 1 and is a result of the presence of ethanol sugars and polyphenols in these wastewaters 33 indeed the ww is rich in phenolic compounds 98 5 6 2 mg l 1 and polysaccharides 247 7 2 9 mg l 1 which have great potential for further valorization table 1 shows that not only ph of ww is out of the legally acceptable range but also cod and phenols are much higher than the legal threshold acceptable for an effluent discharge to the natural water courses in case that the effluent from a winery plant is treated in a domestic wastewater treatment plant wwtp the threshold of cod is 125 mg o2 l 1 although ww composition is variable depending on several factors such as the season type of wine and the train of operations similar ww characteristics have been reported in the literature 33 34 3 2 cmc empirical determination of the selected surfactant the critical micelle concentration cmc of the cationic surfactant esterquat in water at three ph levels 2 0 5 0 and 8 0 was determined through surface tension measurements the variation of the surface tension with the concentration of the surfactant is illustrated in fig 2 the cmc is determined from the intersection between the linear regression of the two regions pre and post cmc 35 as can be observed in fig 2 the cmc of esterquat is lower in an acidic medium ph 2 0 which means that a lower surfactant concentration is needed to form micelles the cmc obtained in this study at ph 5 0 and 8 0 54 8 and 54 0 mg l 1 respectively are similar to the values reported using distilled water 13 it is important to note that esterquat is an environmentally friendly cationic surfactant in which an ester bond is located between the quaternary ammonium groups head and the hydrocarbon tail 20 under alkaline conditions the ester groups due to the adjacent quaternary ammonium group become extremely susceptible to hydrolysis 36 as a consequence the stability of esterquat becomes extremely dependent on the medium ph where higher stability is found at acidic ph as stable condition favors the micelle formation the cmc is expected to be lower less surfactant is required at acidic conditions 20 36 37 3 3 membrane characterization the distilled water permeation flux j0 was measured and plotted in fig 3 as a function of the transmembrane pressure δp a linear correlation r2 0 9953 between j0 and δp can be observed in this study when the ultrafiltration was conducted with distilled water an lp of 42 09 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was calculated which is similar to the value indicated by the manufacturer of the membrane 50 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the membrane resistance determined was 8 55 1012 m 1 before each experiment the membrane was always submitted to a cleaning step and the permeability lp was determined to ensure the same initial experimental conditions 3 4 micellar enhanced ultrafiltration of winery wastewater in the first stage the meuf studies involved not only the analysis of the effect of the surfactant concentration on the rejection of gallic acid but also the effect of ph on the membrane fouling mechanism and the rejection coefficient then synthetic solutions of multi component were considered to analyze the effect of the concentration aiming to recover polyphenols the study ends by testing a real effluent in particular to assess the efficiency of the polyphenols and polysaccharides separation 3 4 1 effect of cationic surfactant concentration the effect of the esterquat concentrations 0 1 3 5 5 and 10 cmc on the rejection r of total phenolic content present in ga solution at four ph levels 2 0 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 was studied and the results are summarized in fig 4 in the case of the ga ultrafiltration without surfactant 0 cmc it was observed that the rejection is very low between 3 6 and 6 2 at all the four ph levels studied these results were expected since the molecular weight of gallic acid 170 g mol 1 is significantly lower than the membrane cut off 10 kda resulting in an easier transport of the solute through the membrane which leads to a low solute rejection once the surfactant concentration is equal to the critical micellar concentration 1cmc it is possible to observe an increase in the solute rejection but this effect is more pronounced for the ga solution at ph 5 0 increasing from 6 2 to 29 1 than for the other ph levels the results show the benefit of meuf compared to the conventional uf regarding the removal of phenolic compounds however a reduction in the permeate flow of 68 from 154 to 49 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was observed with the addition of the cationic surfactant due to the fouling phenomenon other studies also reported by similar results 13 16 due to the higher surfactant concentration in the feed there is an increase in the number of micelles leading to a higher solubility of the solute in the micelles 13 16 in fact in all tests it is possible to verify that the rejection reaches the maximum at a concentration of 5 5 cmc therefore 5 5 cmc was considered the optimal surfactant concentration among those studied and was applied in the subsequent experiments 3 4 2 effect of initial ph in this study the fouling mechanism is responsible for the flux decline during the meuf of ga and this phenomenon was evaluated through hermia s models to evaluate the ph effect on the fouling mechanism three ph levels were tested 3 0 5 0 and 9 0 at constant surfactant concentration 5 5 cmc the results are shown in fig 5 and the model s parameters are summarized in table 2 the results show that ph has a great influence on the flux values of ga through the membrane as can be seen in fig 5 the initial permeate flux decreases significantly with the increase of the solution ph in fact there is a reduction of 86 in the permeate flux when the ph changes from 3 0 to 5 0 the reduction of the permeate flux is directly associated with an increase in the fouling of the membrane according to boussu et al 38 the fouling is affected by both solution ph and surfactant nature in the case of a cationic surfactant the least fouling is observed at low ph as the present study suggests although the permeate flux is greatly affected by the solution ph the observed fouling mechanism is the same as can be seen in table 2 the complete pore blocking describes perfectly r2 1 0000 the fouling mechanism of all meuf experiments the optimized values found of parameter kcb are 53 1 19 9 and 19 2 h 1 for ph 3 0 5 0 and 9 0 respectively the kcb value decreases inversely with the increase in membrane pore blockage when the ph changes from 3 0 to 5 0 the surfactant micelles could be deposited on the membrane surface or even into its pores causing complete blocking an effective cleaning method is a key factor when it comes to process efficiency and membrane durability furthermore the solution ph can affect the solubility of natural phenolic compounds in surfactant micelles 16 and consequently the meuf efficiency thus several experiments were performed with ph adjustments from ph 2 0 to ph 9 0 of the ga solution with a surfactant concentration of 5 5 cmc the results obtained are shown in fig 6 the results demonstrate a low rejection coefficient 20 at ph 2 0 3 0 and 4 0 while a significant increase in r occurs at ph 5 0 according to radalla 39 the gallic acid has the first dissociation constant at ph 4 1 were a proton from the carboxylic group cooh is ionized which may contribute to enhance the interaction with the cationic surfactant polar head above ph 6 0 the r values start to decrease from 59 3 30 8 analogous results have been reported 13 16 the maximum rejection coefficient 60 2 was reached at ph 5 0 and therefore considered in subsequent experiments similar rejection coefficients were reported in works where a cationic surfactant was used 40 3 4 3 effect of multi component solutions as the objective of this study is to optimize the performance of the meuf to be further applied to a real effluent with a complex matrix it is necessary to evaluate the effect of this complexity in the rejection coefficient of phenolic compounds accordingly as already mentioned in section 2 1 in addition to the ga solution three other solutions glc ga glc and mpa glc were tested at 4 bar of transmembrane pressure at ph 5 0 and with a concentration of 5 5 esterquat cmc the results are depicted in fig 7 in fig 7 is evident that the glucose glc rejection coefficient is significantly lower when compared to the rejection of gallic acid ga contrary to what happened with the ga solution when the uf of the glc solution was performed it was possible to observe that the effect of the addition of surfactant was almost insignificant r changes from 7 to 9 with 0cmc and 5 5cmc respectively indicating that the glucose does not dissolve into the surfactant micelles in fact the results of the ga glc meuf showed that the phenolic rejection coefficient is essentially the same 59 9 whereas a slight decrease occurs in the r of glucose 5 0 the results demonstrate that the presence of glucose does not have a negative impact on the recovery of phenolic compounds therefore the surfactant mainly interacts with the polyphenols these results also reveal that is possible to successfully separate the two components the meuf experiments of a mixture of phenolic acids gallic vanillic and protocatechuic and glucose mpa glc resulted in a lower phenolic rejection r 52 2 and a slightly higher glucose rejection 9 9 when compared to the results obtained for the ga glc solution this lower rejection rate shows that the interaction between the surfactant and the polyphenols is also dependent on the chemical nature of these compounds the degree of hydrophobicity of the phenolic compounds determines their solubilization in the esterquat micelles causing different rejection values indeed purkait et al 19 demonstrated that such interactions are dependent on the ionic characteristics of phenolic compounds thus it is possible to conclude that the degree of separation between phenolic compounds and glucose decreases with the increase of the matrix complexity 3 4 4 effect of the solution concentration the effects of the initial concentration of mpa glc on the phenolic and glucose rejection coefficient were studied under the optimal condition determined in the previous sections with the results shown in fig 8 both phenolic acids and glucose retentions decrease as the concentration in the feed solution increases similar results were observed in other studies 19 since micelle concentration is constant in the feed 5 5cmc the solubilization capacity of the micelles is also constant the addition of solute in the feed above the solubilization capacity of the micelles will result in a higher insolubilized solute concentration leading to a higher concentration of solute in the permeate reducing the observed retention 19 the results show a higher separation when the feed solution is composed of 50 mg l 1 of phenolic acids and 125 mg l 1 of glucose where r is 78 1 and 19 5 for phenolic compounds and glucose respectively the optimal conditions determined in the previous sections for model solutions 4 bar 5 5cmc ph 5 0 and the solute concentration were applied to ww real winery wastewater to assess the efficiency of the polyphenols and polysaccharides separation the main results are summarized in table 3 the treatment of real winery wastewater by meuf resulted in a high decrease of tph and tps which means high r thus the initial organic load in the permeate also reduces about 80 of the initial cod indeed polyphenols and polysaccharides are the main contributors to the organic load of ww 33 34 the rejection coefficient of the phenolic compounds is 78 3 which is similar to the values obtained for the model solutions 78 1 however there is an increase in the rejection coefficient of polysaccharides 47 3 compared to the value previously obtained 19 5 this increase in retention occurs due to the presence of high molecular weight polysaccharides 180 260 kda in ww 41 when compared to the cut off of the membrane 10 kda to obtain a greater separation between polyphenols and polysaccharides conventional ultrafiltration must be carried out before meuf the conventional uf will allow the permeation of phenolic compounds and the retention of the high molecular weight polysaccharides the micellar enhanced ultrafiltration of a wastewater from a wine industry exhibited interesting results when it comes to the recovery of phenolic compounds in fact the obtained results are within the range reported by others when using other common technologies in various types wastewaters table 4 for valorization purposes of the phenolic compounds as bioactive agents the retentate of the meuf process should be subjected to downstream operations which necessarily include fractionation and purifications steps initially the recovery of the surfactant for reuse allowing the separation of a mixture of polyphenols must be carried out thus the precipitation of the surfactant can be promoted using for example a calcium salt under appropriate conditions the micelles sequester calcium ions releasing the phenolic species resulting in the precipitation of the surfactant in order to fractionate the phenolic mixture some selective ion exchange resins can be applied the selective recovery of the target phenols is achieved in the elution step of the resins through suitable solvents 3 4 5 techno economic assessment of meuf the practical application of the studied technology requires an evaluation of its techno economic viability when tested at industrial scale meuf process must be scaled up by maintaining constant the permeate volume to membrane surface area ratio membrane material and pore size and filtrate pressure a configuration with multiple membrane modules in series should be employed for the processing of large amounts of wastewater the process economy depends on the following costs i membrane fabrication cost ii scale up investment involving pumps valves energy consumption and depreciation cost and 3 operational costs including maintenance and utility costs the membrane fouling causing periodic cleanings and its replacement is a significant limitation to the economic viability of the large scale process another important limitation is the surfactant recovery that can be reused in the filtration process there are still economic and environmental issues to be overcome for the use of the mef technique in large scale applications 4 conclusions this work showed that the rejection of polyphenols and polysaccharides from simulated winery wastewater ww by meuf is affected by some operating variables cationic surfactant concentration ph composition of ww the rejection of gallic acid ga was maximum for 5 5 cmc of the surfactant esterquat the ph has a significant effect on the initial flux and a reduction of 86 was observed when it increased from 3 0 to 5 0 the fouling mechanism was characterized by the complete pore blocking model ga rejection increased with an increase of ph up to 5 which was considered the optimal value the rejection of ga was not affected by the presence of glucose and its separation is feasible through meuf however the degree of separation between phenolic compounds and glucose depends on the matrix complexity the results for real ww showed a rejection of 78 3 for phenolic compounds and 47 3 for polysaccharides the work demonstrated that meuf is a promisor approach for the valorization of ww declaration of competing

13789,silver silver oxide nanoparticles agnps is one of the most effective inorganic compounds that acts as an antibacterial agent against escherichia coli e coli bacteria in this study bio silver or silver oxide bio agnps was synthesised from the seeds and peels of the parkia speciosa p speciosa plant a green reducing agent the seeds and peels were extracted separately via facile methods using a solution of silver nitrate agno3 the seeds were soaked and peels mixed with the agno3 solution the resulting bio agnps were then incorporated into polysulfone psf membranes at different weight percentages 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 1 0 wt the results showed that the psf mixed matrix membrane mmm with 1 0 wt of p speciosa peel derived bio agnps pp1 0 had the most optimum properties with a smaller crystallite size of 51 60 nm an average diameter of finger like cavities of 15 23 μm the smallest mean pore size of 10 20 nm and the highest surface roughness of 39 90 nm pp1 0 was also found to be highly hydrophilic since it had the lowest contact angle 63 30 which was corroborated by the highest hydroxyl oh peak 3454 21 cm 1 seen during fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy analysis pp1

inhibition ring this proved that pp1 0 had the potential to be applied as an antibacterial membrane for water separation keywords p speciosa bio agnps psf mixed matrix membrane water separation antibacterial 1 introduction polysulfone psf membrane is an ultrafiltration membrane used in wastewater treatment 1 4 psf membranes provide high purification and are a convenient reverse osmosis water pre treatment option 5 in addition to possessing excellent thermal and mechanical properties as well as superior chemical resistance 6 however the adsorption of colloidal particles and dissolved solids on the membrane s surface and in its pores cause fouling a costly phenomenon affecting a wide range of industrial sectors such as water cooling towers drinking water systems and wastewater treatment 1 due to hydrophobic interactions van der waals attractions hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions some of the foulants are adsorbed by the membrane s surface 7 this results in pore narrowing pore blocking and cake formation inside the membrane 6 hence improving the hydrophilicity of the psf membrane is of the highest priority as it affects its performance the addition of inorganic nanoparticles such as silver ag silver peroxide ago titanium dioxide tio2 aluminium oxide al2o3 zirconium oxide zro2 and silicon dioxide sio2 in the membrane matrix helps mitigate against fouling and improves membrane separation 8 9 of these additives silver nanoparticles agnps have been most widely used to disinfect medical devices home appliances and in water treatment 10 apart from possessing exceptional optical thermal and electrical properties agnps are hypoallergenic and non toxic as well its antibacterial properties promise excellent potential in the manufacturing of mixed matrix membranes mmms the rapidly progressing field of nanoparticle green synthesis further improves the potential of synthesising agnps from naturally sourced reduction agents such as plant leaves bacteria fungi and enzymes 11 12 plant extracts are a successful reduction agent for bio agnp synthesis 13 17 since they are rich in amide phenols carbonyl compounds and flavonoids 13 18 19 a reduction agent is a chemical compound that reduces ions in the original solution the growth and size of nanoparticles are later controlled using a capping agent therefore bio agnps in combination with silver nitrate agno3 is considered a promising plant based reducing agent alternative parkia speciosa p speciosa extract is a good reducing agent since it contains active organic compounds such as flavonoids 5 6 wt phenols 50 85 wt tannins and saponins which play a vital role in reducing metal ions and capping bio agnps 16 20 22 even though p speciosa smells foul it is still considered a good reducing agent option for the green synthesis of bio agnps for psf membranes 23 24 we have previously conducted studies on the synthesis of bio agnps from extracts of p speciosa pods seeds and leaves our studies concluded that p speciosa leaf derived bio agnps had the best psf mmm performance in terms of water permeation flux 393 3 19 7 l m 2 h 1 and repulsion of humic acid 98 6 4 9 with the lowest internal resistance 7 9 0 4 1012 m 1 and the formation of a large antibacterial inhibition ring 4 5 mm however the concentration of the extract was limited to 1 0 wt 23 therefore the objective of this study was to synthesise bio agnps from the seeds and peels of the p speciosa plant then mix them in different weight percentages in psf dope solutions during the fabrication process the structural properties morphology mean pore radius surface roughness chemical interactions and contact angles of each mmm was then analysed finally the performance of the mmms was investigated via several techniques 2 material and methods 2 1 green synthesis of bio agnps the seeds and peels of the p speciosa plant were collected near universiti tun hussein onn malaysia the specimens were then washed separately in distilled water before drying in an oven over a few days to remove contaminants each p speciosa seed and pod was ground individually and found to weigh approximately 4 0 g each

honeywell fluka the mixed solutions were then incubated overnight in the dark to minimise the risk of agno3 photo activation the solutions were then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 20 min impurities were removed by dissolving and washing the samples in distilled water before drying in a 40 c oven fig s1 illustrates the method of bio agnps synthesis from the seeds and peels of the p speciosa plant 2 2 fabrication of psf bio agnps mmms psf pellets udel p 1700 were dried in a 60 c oven for 1 h before being dissolved in n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp emplura solvent at 60 c for 4 h under vigorous stirring a pore forming agent polyethylene glycol 400 mw peg 400 r m chemicals was added to each of the synthesised bio agnps that had been extracted from both the seeds and peels of the p speciosa plant this mixed extract was then incorporated at different concentrations 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 1 0 wt into separate psf dope solutions each solution was continuously stirred for 30 min until a homogeneous solution formed bubbles were released from the psf dope solutions by placing the bottles in an electrostatic machine for 1 h and leaving it for 30 min afterwards a thickness ranging from 100 to 120 μm was maintained during the membrane casting process phase inversion was performed by separately immersing each mmm into a coagulation bath of distilled water after drying for 48 h the thin flat mmms were detached from the glass and labelled according to their specific compositions as tabulated in table s1 2 3 characterisation of psf bio agnps mmms the structural properties of the mmms were

that 21 of the most intense ag and ago peaks in the mmms occurred at 2θ this confirmed that the bio agnps were pure fig 1 a and b the existence of a cubic structure for ag with a jcpds file number of 00 004 0783 and a monoclinic structure for ago with a jcpds file number of 00 043 1038 in the mmms were in accordance with a previous study on the effects of agnps on psf ultrafiltration membranes 8 the higher diffraction pattern intensity of mmms with peel derived bio agnps showed that p speciosa peels were a stronger reduction agent compared to its seeds these findings were similar to previous studies that investigated using other stems stalks or other hard shelled plant extracts that contained high concentrations of reduction compounds 25 26 3 2 morphology and topography of psf bio agnp mmms cross sectional morphology is another important aspect to focus on since it affects separation performance the mmms showed asymmetrical microstructures dense tops well defined structures with long and straight finger like extensions porous void structures at the sublayers of the membranes and suppressed micro voids at the bottoms this tallied closely with the composition of the psf solutions with different bio agnp weight percentages 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 1 0 wt during the precipitation process and from which part of the p speciosa plant the bio agnps had been synthesised fig 2 ai to ii the fast diffusional exchange of the nmp solvent in the non solvent coagulation bath during phase inversion caused instantaneous de mixing and formation of the porous membrane 27 however a difference was still observed in the average diameters of the finger like cavities fig 3 a this was because these values depended on bio agnp weight percentages and the part of the p speciosa plant that was used during bio agnp synthesis in the membranes the unmodified p0 membrane had the lowest average diameter of finger like cavities 3 84 μm as shown in figs 2 ai 3a a d and table s1 meanwhile the diameter of the finger like cavities decreased as the bio agnp weight percentages in mmms increased as presented in figs 2 bi ii and 3a a d and table s1 the highest peel derived bio agnp weight percentage of 1 0 wt pp1 0 yielded the lowest average diameter of finger like cavities at 15 23 μm meanwhile the highest seed derived bio agnp weight percentage of 1 0 wt ps1 0 yielded the lowest average diameter of finger like cavities at 14 00 μm this proved that the average diameter of finger like cavities strongly correlated with bio agnp weight percentage and the part of the p speciosa plant that was used to synthesise the bio agnps the faster diffusional exchange of nmp in water during the phase inversion process of ps0 1 can also be related to the average diameter of finger like cavities faster de mixing would form the smallest finger like cavities although pp0 1 had a small average diameter of finger like cavities it still performed better since it had higher hydrophilicity smaller contact angle compared to ps0 1 this is further discussed in section 3 3 additionally the combination of a small average diameter of finger like cavities and the hydrophobic nature of ps0 1 was unable to enhance its morphological properties the cross sections of the mmms were similar to the morphology of psf mixed with silver graphene oxide ag go in the sense that hydrophilic nanomaterials had been mixed with hydrophobic polymeric membrane matrices 4 an elemental analysis showed the presence of ag and ago in pp1 0 and ps1 0 fig 2 eiii and iiii the topography and surface roughness of the mmms were examined via afm fig 3b the brightest regions highest points of porous membrane surface increased proportionally with increasing ra as the bio agnp weight percentage increased fig 3b a d and table s1 the valleys or pore entrances were denoted by the darkest regions which show where the membrane was less dense and had a smoother surface both these conditions occurred as a consequence of thorough mixing between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic bio agnps derived from p speciosa peels and seeds with psf during mmm fabrication of the psf mmms pp1 0 had the highest ra 39 90 nm fig 3b biv and b d pp1 0 also had the roughest surface due to its tendency to embed in the outer surface of the membrane making it coarser 23 however pp1 0 did not suffer any deficiencies as it still depended on the physical properties of the peels and the hydrophilic hydrophobic nature of the mmm which will be discussed further in section 3 3 psfs mixed with seed derived bio agnps also experienced a similar trend of increasing ra as the bio agnp weight percentage increased however the ra was much lower than that of psf mixed with peel derived bio agnp ps1 0 had the lowest ra 10 17 fig 3b civ and 3b d the smoother surface was attributed to the effect of seed derived bio agnps which is amphiphilic in nature due to the physical properties of the seeds themselves 10 thus these membranes tend to be hydrophobic resulting in a smoother surface overall the addition of bio agnps improved the topography and surface roughness of the membranes compared to the p0 membrane 3 3 chemical interaction and hydrophilicity of psf bio agnp mmms the chemical interactions that occurred in the psf bio agnp mmms were analysed using ftir spectroscopy for the purposes of this study ftir analysis was only conducted on mmms with the highest bio agnp weight percentage 1 0 wt in contrast the lower bio agnp weight percentages 0 1 0 3 0 5 wt did not affect the interactions between psf and bio agnps presenting only as small shifts in all ftir peaks the broad hydroxyl oh peak vibration ranges between 3600 cm 1 and 3000 cm 1 in pp1 0 were more noticeable compared to p0 and ps1 0 figure s2 other ftir peaks also shifted but not as noticeably as the oh peaks shown in table s2 this demonstrated that the hydrogen bond phenol and terpenoid as a reduction and capping agent of the peel derived bio agnps was the main contributor of the chemical interactions this directly correlated with the results of the contact angle 23 the absence of carbonyl co bio agnp peaks at 1696 cm 1 in pp1 0 also confirmed that peel derived bio agnps had mixed well in the psf matrices in comparison to the small co bio agnp peak seen at 1680 78 cm 1 in ps1 0 the contact angles of psf bio agnp mmms corresponded with the chemical interactions the contact angles decreased as the peel derived bio agnp weight percentages increased in the mmms fig 4 a d fig 4 biv and 4 d show the lowest contact angle 63 30 in pp1 0 this confirmed that pp1 0 was hydrophilic and correlated with the large stretching vibrations of the oh peak 3454 21 cm 1 in fig s2 it was suggested that pp1 0 had greater interaction with water the ability of pp1 0 to absorb a large quantity of water in order to become hydrophilic corresponds to the physical properties of p speciosa peels hence the contact angle of pp1 0 also decreased however inverse correlations were seen in psf mmms impregnated with seed derived bio agnp fig 4 c and d the contact angle increased proportionally with bio agnp weight percentages ps1 0 had the highest contact angle 81 90 as shown in fig 5 civ and 5 d this was corroborated by small shifts in the ftir peak for oh at 3068 07 cm 1 and co peak at 1680 78 cm 1 compared to pp1 0 the physically hard and sticky properties of the seeds themselves contributed to the hydrophobic nature of seed derived bio agnps 3 4 physical properties of psf bio agnp mmms the mean pore size of all mmms decreased as bio agnp weight percentages increased fig 4 e and table s1 the dissimilar average diameter of finger like cavities and mean pore size occurred due to different calculation methods the average diameter of finger like cavities was measured directly by imagej software while the mean pore size was calculated using the guerout elford ferry technique which takes into consideration factors such as water viscosity membrane thickness volume of permeated water per unit time effective area of the membrane and operational pressure the mean pore size of psf mixed with peel derived bio agnp was lower particularly for pp1 0 which was attributed to the formation of smaller finger like cavities during phase inversion however pp1 0 still performed better than psf mixed with seed derived bio agnp due to higher hydrophilicity peel derived bio agnp mmms tended to increase water separation performance compared to the hydrophobic ps1 0 3 5 water filtration leaching of bio agnps and antibacterial activity pwf was conducted to determine the volume of water passing through psf bio agnp mmms pwf increased as bio agnp weight percentages increased fig 5 a and table s1 pp1 0 had the highest pwf 327 73 l m 2 h 1 the higher surface roughness of psf mixed with the hydrophilic peel derived bio agnps provided a more effective water molecule permeation pathway 28 29 however the pwf of mmms impregnated with seed derived bio agnps was slightly lower due to the membrane properties discussed in sections 3 2 3 4 the higher hydrophobicity and lower surface roughness of the membranes also led to lower pwf contribution by seed derived bio agnps agglomeration was found to have occurred in and on the surface of the membranes ha rejection increased from 47 47 to 67 21 as the weight percentage of peel derived bio agnp increased as shown in fig 5 b and table s1 the higher surface roughness tended to form ha precipitation on the surface of the membrane and lower the percentage of rejection since the psf mixed with peel derived bio agnp was hydrophilic in nature and was supported by physical cleaning backwashing in the real application it had potential and relevance of use 30 31 clean water and air assisted the physical cleaning process as illustrated in figure s3 although the rejection of psf mixed with seed derived bio agnp mmms was higher due to low surface roughness up to 98 99 the other performance results such as normalised flux ratio total membrane resistance and leaching of bio agnps into water warrant consideration for the purposes of this study only on a few samples were selected for total ha permeate ﬂux analysis based on their pwf and rejection results the normalised flux ratio decreased gradually and proportionally with time fig 5 c and d pp1 0 had the lowest normalised flux ratio 0 68 compared to p0 0 71 and ps1 0 0 70 this was due to pp1 0 s average diameter and shape of its finger like cavities surface roughness hydrophilicity and mean pore radius the slightly larger and uniform cylindrical pore configuration of pp0 5 and pp1 0 were less prone to fouling compared to the smaller average diameter of finger like cavities and hydrophobic nature of ps0 5 ps1 0 and p0 this was because it is harder for foulants to be deposited in these kinds of pores 32 filtration performance was quantitatively analysed by plotting the total resistance rt of individual mmms figs 5 e f and table s1 this was calculated using eq s 6 to 9 ps0 5 had the highest rt value 12 00 1012 m 1 followed by ps1 0 10 6 1012 m 1 this can be attributed to the mmm properties discussed in sections 3 2 3 4 meanwhile pp0 5 had a rt value of 7 21 1012 m 1 followed by pp1 0 with 6 76 1012 m 1 although p0 had the lowest rt value 5 44 1012 m 1 indicating that it had lower resistance and ha precipitation formation on the surface the properties and performance of p0 were still lower compared to pp1 0 and ps1 0 therefore among these membranes pp1 0 s rt value of 6 76 1012 m 1 was still considered reasonable the amount of bio agnp leaching from the psf bio agnp mmms was also investigated under both static storage and filtration conditions to estimate the rate of bio agnp leaching from selected mmms p0 pp1 0 and ps1 0 pp1 0 and ps1 0 were selected since they contained the highest amounts of bio agnps while p0 served as a control sample p0 did not experience any leaching since it did not contain any bio agnps table s1 bio agnp leaching from ps1 0 under static storage 1 13 μg l and after filtration 3 85 μg l was higher compared to pp1 0 in static storage 0 09 μg l and after filtration 1 56 μg l due to the properties of ps1 0 s mmm under static storage conditions less bio agnps leached from both pp1 0 and ps1 0 since bio agnp dissolution halted when dissolved oxygen was consumed during closed storage conditions bio agnp leaching from pp1 0 was lower than the 2 00 mg l found to have leached in previous studies on agnps dispersed in psf mmms these results demonstrate that the bio agnp morphology obtained in our previous study 24 did not have any obvious effects on bio agnp leaching during membrane storage so long as dissolved oxygen was limited e g closed storage and without replacing the storage water 33 meanwhile during membrane filtration bio agnps leaching was accelerated due to the continuous supply of dissolved oxygen from water during filtration 33 thus the bio agnps in ps1 0 tend to release and contribute to higher leaching during filtration the agglomeration of bio agnps due to the small average diameter and shape of finger like cavities lowered ps1 0 s surface roughness and hydrophobicity compared to bio agnp leaching in pp1 0 in contrast the large average diameter and shape of finger like cavities higher surface roughness and hydrophilicity of pp1 0 enables it to retain bio agnps in its mmm hence this condition can reduce bio agnp leaching even with a continuous supply of dissolved oxygen from water during filtration with regards to antibacterial activity against e coli the absence of an inhibition ring around the p0 membrane confirmed that there was no interaction against e coli as shown in fig 5 g meanwhile inhibition rings began to form around pp1 0 and ps1 0 as shown in fig 5 h and i respectively ps1 0 formed the widest inhibition ring 17 93 mm2 around its mmm table s1 this was attributed to the higher hydrophobicity and surface roughness of its mmm which enabled it to disrupt interaction with e coli although pp1 0 s inhibition ring was slightly narrower 16 34 mm2 it still possessed optimum properties and performed well in general our inhibition ring findings were comparable with an earlier study by al aani et al 34 which successfully formed inhibition ring diameters ranging between 15 20 and 19 70 mm against e coli additionally a structural analysis by hu et al 33 claims that the existence of an ag lattice plane 1 1 1 shows stronger antibacterial activity this is similar with the xrd results obtained in our study 4 conclusion the effect of bio silver nanoparticles bio agnps derived from the peels and seeds of the p speciosa plant at different weight percentages wt in polysulfone psf bio agnps mixed matrix membranes mmms was successfully analysed in terms of properties and performance structural analyses proved that the mmms contained bio agnps that had been synthesised from p speciosa peels and seeds the properties and performance of mmms increased as bio agnp wt increased from 0 1 to 1 0 the optimum properties of pp1 0 increased pure water flux pwf reduced internal resistance rt reduced the rate of bio agnp leaching into water during filtration and increased the diameter of the antibacterial inhibition ring against e coli this proved that the addition of bio agnps improved the ability of psf mmms to act as an antibacterial water separator declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgement

13789,silver silver oxide nanoparticles agnps is one of the most effective inorganic compounds that acts as an antibacterial agent against escherichia coli e coli bacteria in this study bio silver or silver oxide bio agnps was synthesised from the seeds and peels of the parkia speciosa p speciosa plant a green reducing agent the seeds and peels were extracted separately via facile methods using a solution of silver nitrate agno3 the seeds were soaked and peels mixed with the agno3 solution the resulting bio agnps were then incorporated into polysulfone psf membranes at different weight percentages 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 1 0 wt the results showed that the psf mixed matrix membrane mmm with 1 0 wt of p speciosa peel derived bio agnps pp1 0 had the most optimum properties with a smaller crystallite size of 51 60 nm an average diameter of finger like cavities of 15 23 μm the smallest mean pore size of 10 20 nm and the highest surface roughness of 39 90 nm pp1 0 was also found to be highly hydrophilic since it had the lowest contact angle 63 30 which was corroborated by the highest hydroxyl oh peak 3454 21 cm 1 seen during fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy analysis pp1 0 also had the highest water permeation flux 327 73 l m 2 h 1 lowest rejection rate 67 21 lowest bio agnp leaching after water filtration 1 56 μg l and the formation of a 16 34 mm2 antibacterial inhibition ring this proved that pp1 0 had the potential to be applied as an antibacterial membrane for water separation keywords p speciosa bio agnps psf mixed matrix membrane water separation antibacterial 1 introduction polysulfone psf membrane is an ultrafiltration membrane used in wastewater treatment 1 4 psf membranes provide high purification and are a convenient reverse osmosis water pre treatment option 5 in addition to possessing excellent thermal and mechanical properties as well as superior chemical resistance 6 however the adsorption of colloidal particles and dissolved solids on the membrane s surface and in its pores cause fouling a costly phenomenon affecting a wide range of industrial sectors such as water cooling towers drinking water systems and wastewater treatment 1 due to hydrophobic interactions van der waals attractions hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions some of the foulants are adsorbed by the membrane s surface 7 this results in pore narrowing pore blocking and cake formation inside the membrane 6 hence improving the hydrophilicity of the psf membrane is of the highest priority as it affects its performance the addition of inorganic nanoparticles such as silver ag silver peroxide ago titanium dioxide tio2 aluminium oxide al2o3 zirconium oxide zro2 and silicon dioxide sio2 in the membrane matrix helps mitigate against fouling and improves membrane separation 8 9 of these additives silver nanoparticles agnps have been most widely used to disinfect medical devices home appliances and in water treatment 10 apart from possessing exceptional optical thermal and electrical properties agnps are hypoallergenic and non toxic as well its antibacterial properties promise excellent potential in the manufacturing of mixed matrix membranes mmms the rapidly progressing field of nanoparticle green synthesis further improves the potential of synthesising agnps from naturally sourced reduction agents such as plant leaves bacteria fungi and enzymes 11 12 plant extracts are a successful reduction agent for bio agnp synthesis 13 17 since they are rich in amide phenols carbonyl compounds and flavonoids 13 18 19 a reduction agent is a chemical compound that reduces ions in the original solution the growth and size of nanoparticles are later controlled using a capping agent therefore bio agnps in combination with silver nitrate agno3 is considered a promising plant based reducing agent alternative parkia speciosa p speciosa extract is a good reducing agent since it contains active organic compounds such as flavonoids 5 6 wt phenols 50 85 wt tannins and saponins which play a vital role in reducing metal ions and capping bio agnps 16 20 22 even though p speciosa smells foul it is still considered a good reducing agent option for the green synthesis of bio agnps for psf membranes 23 24 we have previously conducted studies on the synthesis of bio agnps from extracts of p speciosa pods seeds and leaves our studies concluded that p speciosa leaf derived bio agnps had the best psf mmm performance in terms of water permeation flux 393 3 19 7 l m 2 h 1 and repulsion of humic acid 98 6 4 9 with the lowest internal resistance 7 9 0 4 1012 m 1 and the formation of a large antibacterial inhibition ring 4 5 mm however the concentration of the extract was limited to 1 0 wt 23 therefore the objective of this study was to synthesise bio agnps from the seeds and peels of the p speciosa plant then mix them in different weight percentages in psf dope solutions during the fabrication process the structural properties morphology mean pore radius surface roughness chemical interactions and contact angles of each mmm was then analysed finally the performance of the mmms was investigated via several techniques 2 material and methods 2 1 green synthesis of bio agnps the seeds and peels of the p speciosa plant were collected near universiti tun hussein onn malaysia the specimens were then washed separately in distilled water before drying in an oven over a few days to remove contaminants each p speciosa seed and pod was ground individually and found to weigh approximately 4 0 g each the raw materials were then separately immersed in ethanol merck 70 v v at a 1 8 ratio for a few days before filtering 19 extracts were then obtained via centrifugation the collected crude extracts were dried in an oven over a few days before being mixed with distilled water at a 1 100 ratio 10 0 ml of each of the extracts was mixed with 90 0 ml of 5 0 mm of agno3 reduction agent solution honeywell fluka the mixed solutions were then incubated overnight in the dark to minimise the risk of agno3 photo activation the solutions were then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 20 min impurities were removed by dissolving and washing the samples in distilled water before drying in a 40 c oven fig s1 illustrates the method of bio agnps synthesis from the seeds and peels of the p speciosa plant 2 2 fabrication of psf bio agnps mmms psf pellets udel p 1700 were dried in a 60 c oven for 1 h before being dissolved in n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp emplura solvent at 60 c for 4 h under vigorous stirring a pore forming agent polyethylene glycol 400 mw peg 400 r m chemicals was added to each of the synthesised bio agnps that had been extracted from both the seeds and peels of the p speciosa plant this mixed extract was then incorporated at different concentrations 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 1 0 wt into separate psf dope solutions each solution was continuously stirred for 30 min until a homogeneous solution formed bubbles were released from the psf dope solutions by placing the bottles in an electrostatic machine for 1 h and leaving it for 30 min afterwards a thickness ranging from 100 to 120 μm was maintained during the membrane casting process phase inversion was performed by separately immersing each mmm into a coagulation bath of distilled water after drying for 48 h the thin flat mmms were detached from the glass and labelled according to their specific compositions as tabulated in table s1 2 3 characterisation of psf bio agnps mmms the structural properties of the mmms were characterised via x ray diffraction xrd bruker advanced x ray solutions d8 at the following settings operating voltage 45 kv current 40 ma monochromatic radiation cu kα with λ 1 5406 å 2θ 10 90 and step increment rate 0 05 min the xrd results were further examined using eva software and compared to data from the joint committee on powder diffraction standards jcpds database field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem jeol jsm 7600f was used to characterise the cross sectional morphology of the mmms at 10 kv each membrane was cut into a 1 cm 5 cm rectangle and soaked in liquid nitrogen it was then sputtered using rolled gold at a thickness of 150 nm before being mounted onto an fesem stage imagej software was used to measure the diameter of each membrane s finger like structure and an elemental analysis was conducted using the energy dispersive x ray diffraction edx technique atomic force microscopy afm xe series park systems was used to determine the topography and surface roughness of the each mmm at specific 1 cm2 areas the micrograph was captured using the afm s tapping mode for air under ambient atmospheric conditions each membrane was scanned three times to determine its arithmetical average of the absolute values of mean roughness ra the chemical interactions of each mmm was examined using attenuated total reflection ftir atr ftir perkinelmer spectroscopy between wavenumbers 4000 cm 1 and 600 cm 1 contact angle tests were performed using a video contact angle vca optima system the goniometer sessile drop method was used to quantify the level of edge indicating hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity 1 μm of water was dropped on each membrane s surface then the contact angle was observed and recorded the mean pore size rm of each mmm was

while the rejection and fouling of each membrane was tested using a permeability testing each mmm was cut into a circle with a surface area of 2 8 cm2 with a knife and attached to a membrane cell the pwf test was performed with a specific pressure of 5 bar until the flow of distilled water became steady the pwf and rejection values were determined at a pressure of 2 bar at 10 minute intervals and calculated as follows eq 2 2 j q a δ t where j is the pwf l m 2 h 1 q is the volume of permeated water a is the effective membrane surface area m2 and δt is the permeation time hours the rejection

transferred into a membrane permeability testing unit for the rejection test the rejection rate was measured using the ha solution concentration of 0 2 g l 1 at a pressure of 2 bar ha rejection was

a permeate sample collected every 10 min the concentration polarisation cp layer was removed by washing the membranes with deionised di water for 10 min the cake layer was then removed by flushing with tap water for another 10 min throughout both removal processes the jwf was measured again at 30 min intervals and labelled jc ms 1 this was followed by the removal of foulant adsorption

into a 2 cm 2 cm square and immersed in 25 c distilled water for 24 h the samples were removed from the immersion water bath static storage and filtered for further analysis during permeability testing samples of the filtered solutions were analysed in order to measure bio agnp leaching the analytical range of the solution was extended from ppt parts per trillion to ppm parts per million antibacterial activity against escherichia coli e coli was chosen since this bacterium is normally present in the nom of real wastewater a 50 0 mm diameter was punched out of each mmm and placed in a media culture to be incubated in a 37 c oven the reaction against e coli was observed after 24 h 3 result and discussion 3 1 structural properties of psf bio agnp mmms xrd diffraction patterns showed that 21 of the most intense ag and ago peaks in the mmms occurred at 2θ this confirmed that the bio agnps were pure fig 1 a and b the existence of a cubic structure for ag with a jcpds file number of 00 004 0783 and a monoclinic structure for ago with a jcpds file number of 00 043 1038 in the mmms were in accordance with a previous study on the effects of agnps on psf ultrafiltration membranes 8 the higher diffraction pattern intensity of mmms with peel derived bio agnps showed that p speciosa peels were a stronger reduction agent compared to its seeds these findings were similar to previous studies that investigated using other stems stalks or other hard shelled plant extracts that contained high concentrations of reduction compounds 25 26 3 2 morphology and topography of psf bio agnp mmms cross sectional morphology is another important aspect to focus on since it affects separation performance the mmms showed asymmetrical microstructures dense tops well defined structures with long and straight finger like extensions porous void structures at the sublayers of the membranes and suppressed micro voids at the bottoms this tallied closely with the composition of the psf solutions with different bio agnp weight percentages 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 1 0 wt during the precipitation process and from which part of the p speciosa plant the bio agnps had been synthesised fig 2 ai to ii the fast diffusional exchange of the nmp solvent in the non solvent coagulation bath during phase inversion caused instantaneous de mixing and formation of the porous membrane 27 however a difference was still observed in the average diameters of the finger like cavities fig 3 a this was because these values depended on bio agnp weight percentages and the part of the p speciosa plant that was used during bio agnp synthesis in the membranes the unmodified p0 membrane had the lowest average diameter of finger like cavities 3 84 μm as shown in figs 2 ai 3a a d and table s1 meanwhile the diameter of the finger like cavities decreased as the bio agnp weight percentages in mmms increased as presented in figs 2 bi ii and 3a a d and table s1 the highest peel derived bio agnp weight percentage of 1 0 wt pp1 0 yielded the lowest average diameter of finger like cavities at 15 23 μm meanwhile the highest seed derived bio agnp weight percentage of 1 0 wt ps1 0 yielded the lowest average diameter of finger like cavities at 14 00 μm this proved that the average diameter of finger like cavities strongly correlated with bio agnp weight percentage and the part of the p speciosa plant that was used to synthesise the bio agnps the faster diffusional exchange of nmp in water during the phase inversion process of ps0 1 can also be related to the average diameter of finger like cavities faster de mixing would form the smallest finger like cavities although pp0 1 had a small average diameter of finger like cavities it still performed better since it had higher hydrophilicity smaller contact angle compared to ps0 1 this is further discussed in section 3 3 additionally the combination of a small average diameter of finger like cavities and the hydrophobic nature of ps0 1 was unable to enhance its morphological properties the cross sections of the mmms were similar to the morphology of psf mixed with silver graphene oxide ag go in the sense that hydrophilic nanomaterials had been mixed with hydrophobic polymeric membrane matrices 4 an elemental analysis showed the presence of ag and ago in pp1 0 and ps1 0 fig 2 eiii and iiii the topography and surface roughness of the mmms were examined via afm fig 3b the brightest regions highest points of porous membrane surface increased proportionally with increasing ra as the bio agnp weight percentage increased fig 3b a d and table s1 the valleys or pore entrances were denoted by the darkest regions which show where the membrane was less dense and had a smoother surface both these conditions occurred as a consequence of thorough mixing between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic bio agnps derived from p speciosa peels and seeds with psf during mmm fabrication of the psf mmms pp1 0 had the highest ra 39 90 nm fig 3b biv and b d pp1 0 also had the roughest surface due to its tendency to embed in the outer surface of the membrane making it coarser 23 however pp1 0 did not suffer any deficiencies as it still depended on the physical properties of the peels and the hydrophilic hydrophobic nature of the mmm which will be discussed further in section 3 3 psfs mixed with seed derived bio agnps also experienced a similar trend of increasing ra as the bio agnp weight percentage increased however the ra was much lower than that of psf mixed with peel derived bio agnp ps1 0 had the lowest ra 10 17 fig 3b civ and 3b d the smoother surface was attributed to the effect of seed derived bio agnps which is amphiphilic in nature due to the physical properties of the seeds themselves 10 thus these membranes tend to be hydrophobic resulting in a smoother surface overall the addition of bio agnps improved the topography and surface roughness of the membranes compared to the p0 membrane 3 3 chemical interaction and hydrophilicity of psf bio agnp mmms the chemical interactions that occurred in the psf bio agnp mmms were analysed using ftir spectroscopy for the purposes of this study ftir analysis was only conducted on mmms with the highest bio agnp weight percentage 1 0 wt in contrast the lower bio agnp weight percentages 0 1 0 3 0 5 wt did not affect the interactions between psf and bio agnps presenting only as small shifts in all ftir peaks the broad hydroxyl oh peak vibration ranges between 3600 cm 1 and 3000 cm 1 in pp1 0 were more noticeable compared to p0 and ps1 0 figure s2 other ftir peaks also shifted but not as noticeably as the oh peaks shown in table s2 this demonstrated that the hydrogen bond phenol and terpenoid as a reduction and capping agent of the peel derived bio agnps was the main contributor of the chemical interactions this directly correlated with the results of the contact angle 23 the absence of carbonyl co bio agnp peaks at 1696 cm 1 in pp1 0 also confirmed that peel derived bio agnps had mixed well in the psf matrices in comparison to the small co bio agnp peak seen at 1680 78 cm 1 in ps1 0 the contact angles of psf bio agnp mmms corresponded with the chemical interactions the contact angles decreased as the peel derived bio agnp weight percentages increased in the mmms fig 4 a d fig 4 biv and 4 d show the lowest contact angle 63 30 in pp1 0 this confirmed that pp1 0 was hydrophilic and correlated with the large stretching vibrations of the oh peak 3454 21 cm 1 in fig s2 it was suggested that pp1 0 had greater interaction with water the ability of pp1 0 to absorb a large quantity of water in order to become hydrophilic corresponds to the physical properties of p speciosa peels hence the contact angle of pp1 0 also decreased however inverse correlations were seen in psf mmms impregnated with seed derived bio agnp fig 4 c and d the contact angle increased proportionally with bio agnp weight percentages ps1 0 had the highest contact angle 81 90 as shown in fig 5 civ and 5 d this was corroborated by small shifts in the ftir peak for oh at 3068 07 cm 1 and co peak at 1680 78 cm 1 compared to pp1 0 the physically hard and sticky properties of the seeds themselves contributed to the hydrophobic nature of seed derived bio agnps 3 4 physical properties of psf bio agnp mmms the mean pore size of all mmms decreased as bio agnp weight percentages increased fig 4 e and table s1 the dissimilar average diameter of finger like cavities and mean pore size occurred due to different calculation methods the average diameter of finger like cavities was measured directly by imagej software while the mean pore size was calculated using the guerout elford ferry technique which takes into consideration factors such as water viscosity membrane thickness volume of permeated water per unit time effective area of the membrane and operational pressure the mean pore size of psf mixed with peel derived bio agnp was lower particularly for pp1 0 which was attributed to the formation of smaller finger like cavities during phase inversion however pp1 0 still performed better than psf mixed with seed derived bio agnp due to higher hydrophilicity peel derived bio agnp mmms tended to increase water separation performance compared to the hydrophobic ps1 0 3 5 water filtration leaching of bio agnps and antibacterial activity pwf was conducted to determine the volume of water passing through psf bio agnp mmms pwf increased as bio agnp weight percentages increased fig 5 a and table s1 pp1 0 had the highest pwf 327 73 l m 2 h 1 the higher surface roughness of psf mixed with the hydrophilic peel derived bio agnps provided a more effective water molecule permeation pathway 28 29 however the pwf of mmms impregnated with seed derived bio agnps was slightly lower due to the membrane properties discussed in sections 3 2 3 4 the higher hydrophobicity and lower surface roughness of the membranes also led to lower pwf contribution by seed derived bio agnps agglomeration was found to have occurred in and on the surface of the membranes ha rejection increased from 47 47 to 67 21 as the weight percentage of peel derived bio agnp increased as shown in fig 5 b and table s1 the higher surface roughness tended to form ha precipitation on the surface of the membrane and lower the percentage of rejection since the psf mixed with peel derived bio agnp was hydrophilic in nature and was supported by physical cleaning backwashing in the real application it had potential and relevance of use 30 31 clean water and air assisted the physical cleaning process as illustrated in figure s3 although the rejection of psf mixed with seed derived bio agnp mmms was higher due to low surface roughness up to 98 99 the other performance results such as normalised flux ratio total membrane resistance and leaching of bio agnps into water warrant consideration for the purposes of this study only on a few samples were selected for total ha permeate ﬂux analysis based on their pwf and rejection results the normalised flux ratio decreased gradually and proportionally with time fig 5 c and d pp1 0 had the lowest normalised flux ratio 0 68 compared to p0 0 71 and ps1 0 0 70 this was due to pp1 0 s average diameter and shape of its finger like cavities surface roughness hydrophilicity and mean pore radius the slightly larger and uniform cylindrical pore configuration of pp0 5 and pp1 0 were less prone to fouling compared to the smaller average diameter of finger like cavities and hydrophobic nature of ps0 5 ps1 0 and p0 this was because it is harder for foulants to be deposited in these kinds of pores 32 filtration performance was quantitatively analysed by plotting the total resistance rt of individual mmms figs 5 e f and table s1 this was calculated using eq s 6 to 9 ps0 5 had the highest rt value 12 00 1012 m 1 followed by ps1 0 10 6 1012 m 1 this can be attributed to the mmm properties discussed in sections 3 2 3 4 meanwhile pp0 5 had a rt value of 7 21 1012 m 1 followed by pp1 0 with 6 76 1012 m 1 although p0 had the lowest rt value 5 44 1012 m 1 indicating that it had lower resistance and ha precipitation formation on the surface the properties and performance of p0 were still lower compared to pp1 0 and ps1 0 therefore among these membranes pp1 0 s rt value of 6 76 1012 m 1 was still considered reasonable the amount of bio agnp leaching from the psf bio agnp mmms was also investigated under both static storage and filtration conditions to estimate the rate of bio agnp leaching from selected mmms p0 pp1 0 and ps1 0 pp1 0 and ps1 0 were selected since they contained the highest amounts of bio agnps while p0 served as a control sample p0 did not experience any leaching since it did not contain any bio agnps table s1 bio agnp leaching from ps1 0 under static storage 1 13 μg l and after filtration 3 85 μg l was higher compared to pp1 0 in static storage 0 09 μg l and after filtration 1 56 μg l due to the properties of ps1 0 s mmm under static storage conditions less bio agnps leached from both pp1 0 and ps1 0 since bio agnp dissolution halted when dissolved oxygen was consumed during closed storage conditions bio agnp leaching from pp1 0 was lower than the 2 00 mg l found to have leached in previous studies on agnps dispersed in psf mmms these results demonstrate that the bio agnp morphology obtained in our previous study 24 did not have any obvious effects on bio agnp leaching during membrane storage so long as dissolved oxygen was limited e g closed storage and without replacing the storage water 33 meanwhile during membrane filtration bio agnps leaching was accelerated due to the continuous supply of dissolved oxygen from water during filtration 33 thus the bio agnps in ps1 0 tend to release and contribute to higher leaching during filtration the agglomeration of bio agnps due to the small average diameter and shape of finger like cavities lowered ps1 0 s surface roughness and hydrophobicity compared to bio agnp leaching in pp1 0 in contrast the large average diameter and shape of finger like cavities higher surface roughness and hydrophilicity of pp1 0 enables it to retain bio agnps in its mmm hence this condition can reduce bio agnp leaching even with a continuous supply of dissolved oxygen from water during filtration with regards to antibacterial activity against e coli the absence of an inhibition ring around the p0 membrane confirmed that there was no interaction against e coli as shown in fig 5 g meanwhile inhibition rings began to form around pp1 0 and ps1 0 as shown in fig 5 h and i respectively ps1 0 formed the widest inhibition ring 17 93 mm2 around its mmm table s1 this was attributed to the higher hydrophobicity and surface roughness of its mmm which enabled it to disrupt interaction with e coli although pp1 0 s inhibition ring was slightly narrower 16 34 mm2 it still possessed optimum properties and performed well in general our inhibition ring findings were comparable with an earlier study by al aani et al 34 which successfully formed inhibition ring diameters ranging between 15 20 and 19 70 mm against e coli additionally a structural analysis by hu et al 33 claims that the existence of an ag lattice plane 1 1 1 shows stronger antibacterial activity this is similar with the xrd results obtained in our study 4 conclusion the effect of bio silver nanoparticles bio agnps derived from the peels and seeds of the p speciosa plant at different weight percentages wt in polysulfone psf bio agnps mixed matrix membranes mmms was successfully analysed in terms of properties and performance structural analyses proved that the mmms contained bio agnps that had been synthesised from p speciosa peels and seeds the properties and performance of mmms increased as bio agnp wt increased from 0 1 to 1 0 the optimum properties of pp1 0 increased pure water flux pwf reduced internal resistance rt reduced the rate of bio agnp leaching into water during filtration and increased the diameter of the antibacterial inhibition ring against e coli this proved that the addition of bio agnps improved the ability of psf mmms to act as an antibacterial water separator declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgement
