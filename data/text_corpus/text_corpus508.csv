2540,this paper provides a fuzzy methodology based on calculating the hydrological return period discharge and the resistance load theory for designing an ogee spillway in a diversion dam hence the uncertainties of rainfall intensity catchment runoff coefficient and spillway discharge coefficient are endowed with triangular fuzzy numbers tfns describing possible values the uncertain parameters may have to do so the rational formula and later the spillway discharge equation are analyzed here to obtain the fuzzy products of the peak runoff and spillway discharge capacity on the basis that both must match the risk is calculated using the difference between the obtained fuzzy product quantities with three fuzzy arithmetic operations it is observed that the standard approximation closely tracks the result of the alpha cut exact method providing a time saving tool for fuzzy calculations since the return period t and risk of failure are related quantities the spillway dimensions are calculated for several recurrence intervals assuming risk equal to 1 t then the fuzzy approach is compared with the conventional return period approach for the design of an ogee crest in three experimental catchments in iran with adequate historical data the result indicates that the fuzzy technique outperforms the conventional return period approach for designing an ogee spillway obtaining an average 29 larger spillway dimension in all case studies beyond that the fuzzy procedure is applied to another catchment with short rainfall runoff data which is impossible to implement the conventional return period method for the hydrologic design of an ogee spillway keywords hydrologic uncertainty triangular fuzzy number rainfall runoff data diversion work return period approach data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction many catastrophic dam failure events due to overtopping over the past centuries proved that conventional procedure fails to work accurately abrishamchi et al 2003 marengo 2006 the traditional design approaches of hydro system infrastructure are classified into four categories tung et al 2006 in the first method the hydro system is designed based on its capability to withstand previous historical flood events cœur and lang 2008 li et al 2020 the second approach is widely used globally for hydrological design in which the design discharge is determined based on frequency analysis of annual peak flow records read and vogel 2015 stedinger 2000 vogel and castellarin 2017 in an appropriate return period however when the historical data is scarce or it is impossible to know the probability distribution of the input data this method is not particularly helpful benson 1960 besides in the return period approach a unique probability distribution is selected as the best fitting distribution rezazadeh baghal and khodashenas 2022 but due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation the peak flood series may follow different or various probability distribution functions salas et al 2013 stedinger et al 1993 contrary to the historical event based and return period approaches the risk based and optimal risk based approaches consider the inherent hydrologic uncertainties afshar et al 2009 tung and bao 1990 tung and mays 1981 however to develop these two models a knowledge of the probability distributions of the resistance and load random components variables is required which is not readily available in literature these two random components are assumed to follow normal or triangular probability distributions for instance afshar et al 1994 presented an optimization model in a river diversion work that incorporates the dimensions of the system component and the diversion design flood uncertainties with triangular and normal probability distributions respectively karamouz et al 2018 assumed that the resistance and load random components have a standard normal distribution but this assumption cannot always be taken for granted several fuzzy approaches have been proposed in hydraulic and hydrologic modeling to overcome the limitations of probabilistic methods particularly with fuzzy numbers for instance yang et al 2013 used tfns for flood risk evaluation and response measures analysis li et al 2018 obtained the risk degree of flash floods by implementing trapezoidal fuzzy numbers huang et al 2010 presented a coupling fuzzy vertex analysis technique for hydrological modeling associated with imprecise information maskey et al 2004 combined a fuzzy set theory with a genetic algorithm for propagating the precipitation uncertainty through a deterministic rainfall runoff routing model for flood forecasting nasseri et al 2014 proposed a new fuzzy arithmetic operator based on the fuzzy extension principle for assessing uncertainty in two monthly water balance models ghorbani mooselu et al 2019 employed a fuzzy transformation method to address the uncertainty in flood flow rate for the stepped spillway design maroufpoor et al 2019 explored a newly developed artificial intelligence model for simulating soil moisture content with the aim of a hybrid adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system with the grey wolf optimizer algorithm the return period and risk of failure are related quantities salas et al 2013 the risk based design approaches mainly incorporate this concept using the well known load resistance theory also the fuzzy risk approach implements the load resistance theory as well which was first introduced by shrestha et al 1990 to assess the reliability of a flood levee structure since then the fuzzy approach for assessing the risk of a hydro system has received increasing attention for instance su and wen 2013 assumed resistance force and load as fuzzy numbers to conduct a fuzzy risk model for the instability risk assessment of gravity dams rezazadeh baghal and khodashenas 2022 used the fuzzy risk concept to optimize the design of a rectangular canal where fuzzy numbers represent the load and resistance obtained from the rational formula and manning equation respectively again rezazadeh baghal and khodashenas 2022 assessed the risk of flooding in a storm sewer with the load and resistance theory and the hydrological return period discharge implementing the fuzzy alpha cut principle and the monte carlo simulation all rainfall runoff models and in the broader sense hydrologic models follow the load and resistance theory as well drawing the attention of many researchers in recent two decades chang and chen 2001 chang et al 2017 cheng et al 2002 özelkan and duckstein 2001 for instance chang et al 2018 used the self adaptive fuzzy inference network for the rainfall runoff modeling zhou et al 2019 proposed a recurrent adaptive network based fuzzy inference system embedded with the genetic algorithm capturing the features of the non stationary process between rainfall and runoff series for making multi step ahead flood forecasts jacquin and shamseldin 2006 explored the application of the takagi sugeno fuzzy inference system to rainfall runoff modeling to describe the non linear relationship between rainfall as an input and runoff as an output ashrafi et al 2017 implemented a neuro fuzzy model for forecasting rainfall runoff and river routing in basins with limited data morales et al 2021 introduced a self identification neuro fuzzy inference model to reduce the uncertainty of the rainfall and runoff lags and the number of membership functions required in a fuzzy system diversion dams provide and regulate water by diverting water from a river into an irrigation canal and may serve to flood control purposes diversion dams have been widely used globally but staggeringly few resources on the risk based design of diversion dams are available in the literature for instance afshar and mariño 1990 proposed a model to incorporate the uncertainty of the flood magnitude estimation for the optimal design of spillway capacity abrishamchi et al 2003 considered hydrological uncertainties involved in the flood routing process to estimate flood magnitude and then integrated them into an optimization model for spillway design alongside the above methods this study provides a state of the art fuzzy risk based design technique for designing an ogee spillway contrary to the probabilistic risk based approach the proposed fuzzy technique does not need the probability distribution of the involved uncertain random parameters also unlike the conventional return period method the long series of the annual peak flood records is not required in the introduced fuzzy method beyond that this paper s results indicate that the conventional return period method underestimates the spillway dimension in addition the entire uncertain hydraulic and hydrologic parameters involved in designing an ogee spillway in a diversion dam as the other gap in the available literature are put in focus here furthermore this study proves if the approximation technique is to select for the fuzzy arithmetic operation the result of the standard approximation method is closely tracking the output of the alpha cut principle this kind of comparison is absent in the current literature the fuzzy theory is used here to study risk in designing spillways based on calculating the hydrological return period discharge so the rational formula and later the discharge rate formula for an ogee spillway are analyzed here using triangular fuzzy numbers to obtain the fuzzy products of the peak runoff and spillway discharge capacity since both fuzzy products must match the risk is calculated using the difference between their quantities as the integral of the negative portion to the entire area of their difference fuzzy membership functions are applied to all parameters in rational and spillway discharge equations except the basin area which is constant here then the required spillway dimension is calculated for several recurrence intervals assuming risk annual exceedance probability equal to 1 t in which t is the return period then the fuzzy methodology and traditional return period method are applied to three case studies in iran surrounded by synoptic weather stations with adequate annual peak flow records and then the results of the two techniques are compared in the final step the fuzzy methodology is applied to design an ogee spillway in another case study in iran suffering from a poor historical record as a mere nine rainfall runoff data is available hence this paper is structured as described in fig 1 2 general concept of triangular fuzzy numbers a triangular fuzzy number a can be defined as a a b c where a b and c denote its lower medium and upper number in which an inequality of a b c must be satisfied a fuzzy number a is a triangular fuzzy number tfn if its membership function μ a is given by 1 μ a x 0 x a x c x a b a a x b c x c b b x c 2 1 description left and right l r representation for fuzzy number a fuzzy number a is a generalized l r type fuzzy number if its membership function is given by 2 μ a x l a 1 x α a 1 α x a 1 1 a 1 x a 2 r x a 2 β a 2 x a 2 β where a 1 a 2 are the shoulders of a the support of a is a 1 α a 2 β as depicted in fig 2 with a 1 a 2 and l x r x 1 x the l r fuzzy number in eq 2 becomes a triangular fuzzy number 3 fuzzy risk technique based on approximated arithmetic operation under the nonlinear operation of fuzzy multiplication and division tfns are not invariant since the result of these operations is a polynomial membership function the approximation methods are linear approximation for fuzzy multiplication and division and only approximate the actual result by the triangular shape for fuzzy arithmetic operations two approximation methods named standard approximation and the l r type fuzzy number introduced first by dubois and prade 1980 are implemented here 3 1 fuzzy risk product based on the l r fuzzy type the fuzzy risk product may define as being the difference between the two fuzzy number products representing the resistance q r lr and the load q l lr respectively the l r type of the fuzzy risk product is defined as 3 z lr q r lr q l lr the risk may be defined as the integral of the negative portion of z lr to the entire area of the fuzzy risk product in the task of spillway design the load and resistance are defined based on the rational formula and spillway discharge equation the two uncertain parameters in the rational formula are rainfall intensity and catchment runoff coefficient represented by tfns the rational formula is obtained as below 4 ql 1 3 6 c f c i a where ql peak flow m3 s c runoff coefficient i rainfall intensity mm h a drainage area km2 and c f is the runoff coefficient adjustment factor the value of c f is listed in table 1 the discharge over an ogee spillway is given by equation 5 qr c d l h 3 2 qr discharge m3 s c d discharge coefficient l effective length of crest m and h actual head of the spillway m the uncertain parameter in the spillway discharge equation is the discharge coefficient represented by tfn hence the aim of this research is to obtain the spillway dimension when c d c and i are uncertain parameters based on eq 3 the l r type fuzzy risk product m3 s is given as below 6 z lr l h 3 2 c d 2 a 3 6 c f c 2 i 2 l h 3 2 c d 2 c d 1 a 3 6 c f c 2 i 2 i 1 c f i 2 c 3 c 2 l h 3 2 c d 3 c d 2 a 3 6 c f c 2 i 3 i 2 i 2 c f c 2 c 1 where cd c d 1 c d 2 c d 3 c c 1 c 2 c 3 and i i 1 i 2 i 3 are triangular fuzzy numbers hence the limit values z 1 z 3 and the most likely value z 2 of the triangular fuzzy risk product are obtained as below 7 z lr z 1 l h 3 2 c d 2 a 3 6 c f c 2 i 2 l h 3 2 c d 2 c d 1 a 3 6 c f c 2 i 2 i 1 i 2 c f c 3 c 2 z 2 l h 3 2 c d 2 a 3 6 c f c 2 i 2 z 3 l h 3 2 c d 2 a 3 6 c f c 2 i 2 l h 3 2 c d 3 c d 2 a 3 6 c f c 2 i 3 i 2 i 2 c f c 2 c 1 since the membership function for the fuzzy risk product in eq 6 is linear having the three points of the triangular fuzzy number at hand eq 7 the value of negative z lr and the fuzzy risk value is readily calculatable as shown in fig 3 3 2 fuzzy risk product based on the standard approximation based on standard approximation arithmetic operations giachetti and young 1997 the approximated triangular fuzzy risk product m3 s is given as below 8

points of this triangle eq 8 gives the risk value 4 fuzzy risk product based on an analytical arithmetic operation in the alpha cut arithmetic operation calculations are made for α 0 1 to drive a parabolic curve representing the actual product based on the alpha cut arithmetic operations chaira 2019 the actual fuzzy risk product is given as below 9 z α q r α q l α l h 3 2 c d 1 c d 2 c d 1 α a

y 1 c d 1 c d 2 2 p 2 2 c 3 c d 1 i 2 c d 2 i 2 2 i 3 c 2 c d 2 i 3 c d 1 i 3 2 i 2 p c f a 3 6 c 3 i 2 c 2 i 3 2 c f 2 a 2 3 6 2 14 y 2 c d 2 c d 3 2 p 2 2 c 2 c d 2 i 1 c d 3 i 1 2 i 2 c 1 c d 3 i 2

a c f 3 3 6 c 3 i 2 c 2 i 3 c 1 i 2 c 2 i 1 hence based on eqs 9 12 and 15 the fuzzy risk is obtained as shown in fig 4 16 risk 1 f o r z 2 0 0 5 α 3 3 6 s 3 3 6 p c d 1 α 2 α c d 2 i 3 3 2 α 2 α i 2

the risk value obtained by the alpha cut principle is mathematically complex and needs cumbersome calculation 5 overview of the study areas the fuzzy theory is used here to study risk in designing spillways of four sites the first two sites have adequate runoff rainfall and annual peak flow data which is appropriate for implementing both the conventional return period and fuzzy approaches the third site has suitable annual peak runoff data but only four rainfall runoff records related to historical flood events are available the last study area has only limited rainfall runoff recorded impeding the usage of the return period approach for calculating the design discharge so only the fuzzy methodology is implemented here to obtain the spillway dimension 5 1 case studies 1 2 the first study area is the firizi catchment fig 5 extending from 3630 126 to 3623 95 and from 59 2 2 to 58 49 3 and the second site is al basin fig 6 located from 3638 979 to 3658 445 and from 5939 875 to 5928 561 which is a part of the kardeh dam s catchment both sites are located near mashhad known as the second largest city in iran and the center of the khorasan razavi province according to köppen geiger s climate classification system two study locations have a bsk cold and semi arid climate the firizi and al basin areas are 283 km2 and 437 km2 respectively based on the reports of meteorological stations the firizi and al study areas receive approximately 430 mm and 374 mm of annual precipitation in addition the average slope of the firizi and al basins is 11 4 and 44 2 while their main river slope is 6 3 and 2 31 the firizi and al main river length is 22 7 km and 46 8 km respectively since 1985 the runoff data and its corresponding rainfall hyetographs have been recorded in hydrometric stations and several synoptic weather stations surrounding and inside both study areas the spillway length in the frizi and al catchments is restricted between 60 m and 80 m and between 55 m and 65 m respectively due to topographic limitations 5 2 case study 3 the tamar catchment is a part of the gorganroud river basin located in golestan province iran which is extended from the northwest of khorasan province to the caspian sea on its eastern side from 3725 155 to 3747 795 and from 5529 606 to 564 784 the basin area is 1524 km2 and its average slope is 19 5 also the main river length is 117 km and its average slope is 1 7 the suitable spillway length in this site is between 140 and 160 m fig 7 shows the study area and the location of the hydrometric station 5 3 case study 4 kaleh vellayat catchment fig 8 extends from 3659 26 to 3654 25 and from 58 5 6 to 5734 3 this basin covers an area of 723 km2 the outlet of the study area is very close to esfarayen city about 20 km known as the third largest city in the khorasan shomali province north of iran according to köppen and geiger s climate classification system the study area has a cold semi arid bsk climate based on the reports of meteorological stations esfarayen city received an approximation of 247 1 mm of annual precipitation also the average slope of the basin and the main river is 14 and 1 respectively the main river length is 62 7 km the hydrometric station is placed at the basin outlet to measure runoff from the study area due to topographic conditions the spillway length is limited between 80 and 100 m 6 description of the selected uncertain parameters the uncertain parameters involved in the rational formula and spillway discharge equation in both study areas are discussed as below 6 1 basin area a since the catchment area naturally is not uncertain it is considered a single valued fixed parameter here 6 2 runoff coefficient adjustment factor c f this parameter value is connected to the selection of storm recurrence interval as listed in table 1 so it is not considered as an uncertain parameter here 6 3 runoff coefficient c the tfn representing the runoff coefficient is calculated based on available rainfall records including 11 and 23 records that contributed to annual peak discharge for case studies 1 and 2 respectively and only four rainfall events related to historical flood events for case study 3 also the tfn c is determined based on short rainfall runoff data for case study 4 tables 2 to 5 provide rainfall runoff scenarios in each site highlighting the runoff coefficient c obtained from each rainfall event so the limit interval of the tfn c is equal to the minimum and maximum value of the obtained runoff coefficients in each case study in addition the most likely value of the tfn c is the mean value of the calculated runoff coefficient fig 9 provides the tfn representing the runoff coefficients contributed to each study area 6 4 rainfall intensity i the maximum flood discharge occurs when the rainfall duration is equal to the time of concentration of the basin the time of concentration is given as below yen et al 1983 17 t c 1 2 nl s 0 5 0 6 where n is manning s roughness coefficient of the catchment l is the mainstream s length and s is the average slope of the main water line the parameters contributed in eq 17 were illustrated in the overview study areas section for each study area the accepted range for manning s n in catchment scale for both sites may vary between 0 03 and 0 07 benson and dalrymple 1967 marcus et al 1992 considering the lower and upper limits for sandy soil and mountain streams with large boulders respectively so based on eq 17 the limit interval and the most likely value when manning s n is equal to 0 05 of time of concentrations for each study area is obtained then available idf curves are implemented to calculate tfns representing the rainfall intensities mm h in three recurrence intervals as listed in table 6 6 5 spillway discharge coefficient c d the non dimensional coefficient of discharge c d is obtained from the expression 18 q 2 3 c d l 2 g h 3 the range of variation of c d is from 0 578 corresponding to the broad crested spillway to 0 75 corresponding to the highest attainable value without exceeding permissible sub atmospheric pressures on the ogee crest khatsuria 2004 hence the limit values of the tfn representing the coefficient of discharge are 0 578 and 0 75 regarding an ogee crest spillway since the upstream pool of the diversion dam can fully accumulate with sediment spillway approach depth becomes almost zero the spillway discharge coefficient can reduce to 0 578 equal to the discharge coefficient of a board crest spillway moreover the upstream pool accumulated sediment level is changing erratically during flood events so the mean of the limit values 0 578 and 0 75 is considered the most likely value of tfn c d fig 10 shows the tfn c d in an ogee crest 7 conventional return period method for spillway design flood frequency analysis based on serially annual peak flow data is the first step of the return period method for spillway design estimating peak flow magnitude for the selected recurrence interval the annual peak flows for case studies 1 to 3 are listed in tables 7 to 9 then after the calculation of the spillway dimension an extra height is added to the maximum upstream pool water surface this freeboard recompenses the uncertainty related to several parameters i e the method of estimating floods reduction of spillway discharge capacity due to debris and other unforeseen future events associated with upstream and downstream development typically for considering freeboard in spillway design an empirical relationship is used consisting of a function of depth of flow d and average flow velocity v as below fb m v m s and d m 19 fb 0 6096 0 03714 v d 1 3 8 results 8 1 design discharge based on the return period approach for case studies 1 to 3 the hyfran plus computer program is used here to fit the suitable statistical distribution s of the data listed in tables 7 to 9 considering 95 confidence limits based on bayesian and akaike information criteria the gamma distribution obtained the best fit for 25 50 and 100 year recurrence intervals in both study areas 1 2 it is observed that the annual maximum flow data in the tamar study area follow the lognormal distribution the design discharges are listed in table 10 fig 11 a shows the required dimension of the ogee spillway based on the fuzzy methodology exact method and the conventional return period technique in various risk values 1 2 and 4 corresponding to 100 50 25 year recurrence intervals in case study 1 moreover the result of the fuzzy theory for spillway design based on three arithmetic operations alpha cut l r fuzzy type standard approximation as well as the return period approach is depicted in fig 11b 11c and 11d and tabulated in table 11 for 25 4 risk 50 2 risk and 100 1 risk year recurrence intervals in case study 1 8 2 fuzzy methodology vs return period method for the ogee crest design it is observed that the conventional return period method underestimates the required spillway dimensions compared to the fuzzy methodology for various recurrence intervals in the first three case studies and by increasing the return period their difference becomes more significant for instance for 25 and 100 year recurrence intervals in case study 1 the difference between the required ogee height in a 60 m spillway length in fuzzy and return period methods is 0 479 m and 1 085 m respectively the reason is by increasing the recurrence interval the freeboard s value only changes slightly increasing from 0 684 m to 0 704 m for 60 m spillway length in the two return periods 25 and 100 year return periods moreover by increasing the spillway length the difference between the fuzzy and conventional return period methods decreased gradually for instance in 80 m spillway length and 25 and 100 year recurrence intervals in case study 1 the differences in the required spillway height between the fuzzy and conventional approaches are decreased to 0 288 m and 0 786 m also the results of the fuzzy technique and the return period method for the ogee spillway design of case study 2 fig 12 and its corresponding table 12 and case study 3 table 13 provide a similar trend obtaining a larger spillway dimension when the fuzzy technique is implemented for instance in case study 3 in which only four rainfall runoff records of historical flood events are available the fuzzy methodology calculates the spillway height about 32 on average more than the return period technique 8 3 error analysis of fuzzy arithmetic operators for spillway design the error of the two approximation methods at a given alpha level is the difference between approximated membership function and the actual one obtained by the alpha cut method the principal source of error between approximation and analytical techniques is the difference between the straight line approximation and the exact polynomial shape of fuzzy products the result of standard approximation in spillway design is very close to the analytical solution overestimating to a maximum 0 01 m ogee crest height when its length is 60 m the errors of the l r fuzzy type are more significant than the standard approximation method underestimating the spillway heights to a maximum of 0 111 m 0 141 m and 0 167 m in 25 50 and 100 year recurrence intervals when the spillway length is 60 m to illustrate the superiority of the standard approximation method over the l r fuzzy type the peak runoff fuzzy product with three arithmetic operation methods in the 25 year recurrence interval based on tfn c and tfn i in case study 1 is shown in fig 13 a it is observed that the maximum error in the l r fuzzy type arithmetic operation is at its base points shifted to the left of the exact method s curve moreover the maximum error in standard approximation arithmetic operation occurs when α 0 5 moving to the left right of the alpha cut curve means the amount of load peak runoff magnitude is underestimated overestimated and it explains why the l r fuzzy type and the standard approximation methods for arithmetic operation underestimate and overestimate the spillway dimension respectively since only two tfns tfn c and tfn i are multiplied to obtain the actual peak runoff fuzzy product the rational formula the highest power of alpha the degree of nonlinearity is two so the multiplication of a fuzzy product by another tfn results in a higher alpha power hypothetically consider three parameters involved in the rational formula c i and cf as triangular fuzzy numbers cf was a fixed parameter for calculating the peak runoff fuzzy product in eqs 7 8 and 16 if the power of alpha increased the error associated with the two approximation methods increased slightly as shown in fig 13b the maximum and mean horizontal distances between the curve and the two lines in fig 13a and 13b is tabulated in table 14 8 4 case study 4 this site kaleh vellayat catchment suffers from poor historical records as only nine rainfall runoff data for a mere five water year are available as listed in table 5 since the annual peak flood magnitude is not recorded here the fuzzy methodology based on the hydrological return period discharge is implemented to design the ogee crest hence the required ogee crest dimensions for 25 50 and 100 year recurrence intervals 4 2 and 1 risk respectively are illustrated in fig 14 and table 15 9 discussion the conventional return period method requires a series of consecutive annual peak flow data to estimate peak flow magnitude for the selected recurrence interval but for many reasons such as a lack of historical data this method is not particularly helpful moreover through frequency analysis of the annual peak flow data the result may fit several probability distributions or sometimes it is impossible to find any probability distribution these limitations and deficiencies privileged the fuzzy methodology for spillway design requiring at least three rainfall runoff data related to storm events the fuzzy approach for the spillway design was investigated with the data of three case studies in iran with adequate annual peak runoff values and the corresponding rainfall data given our finding the conventional return period method underestimates the required spillway dimension proving that the available standard criteria need reconsideration hence the superiorities of the proposed fuzzy methodology over the conventional method for ogee crest spillway design are twofold first the fuzzy technique obtains a larger spillway dimension proving that the return period method fails to work appropriately second when the historical record annual peak flood is scarce and it is impossible to estimate the design flood with the probabilistic criteria the fuzzy technique is privileged requiring at least three rainfall runoff data to perform the ogee crest design as we confront in the kaleh vellayat catchment case study 4 normally the hydrologic design of a spillway is merely based on a single random variable known as the annual peak discharge in other words the traditional return period approach does not include the runoff coefficient which can vary in each rainfall scenario but the proposed fuzzy technique is based on analyzing the rational formula considering the limit interval of the runoff coefficient as a result the traditional method fails to consider the climate change condition in which the upper limit of the runoff coefficient and the rainfall intensity may increase significantly regarding the ogee spillway discharge capacity the traditional design criterion is to consider a relatively fixed amount about 0 75 for the spillway discharge coefficient but due to the presence of debris and other mechanisms this coefficient may decrease during a flood event however a freeboard is added as an extra height of the spillway representing all uncertainties involved in the hydraulic and hydrologic uncertainties but this study proved that by increasing the recurrence interval from 25 year to 100 year freeboard only increases less than 3 on the other hand the fuzzy methodology incorporates any possible values of the spillway discharge coefficient with a triangular fuzzy number changing between 0 578 representing a broad crest spillway and 0 75 during a flood event besides the fuzzy technique with the alpha cut principle leads to the introduction of a cumbersome equation for the risk value calculation eq 16 so two approximation methods for the fuzzy operation are implemented here to reduce the calculation time it is observed that outputs of the standard approximation for the fuzzy arithmetic operation closely track the result of the alpha cut method and its error is significantly lower than the l r fuzzy type technique the exact difference between the three fuzzy arithmetic operations is mutable things changing with recurrence intervals and spillway dimension thus in the task of spillway design the standard approximation for arithmetic operation preserves acceptable accuracy providing a time saving tool for practicing engineers the proposed fuzzy methodology has the following limitations first at least three rainfall runoff data related to flood events are required second the rainfall intensity is assumed to be uniform throughout experimental catchments over the time of concentration and finally some parameters in the rational and spillway discharge equations are constant here i e the runoff coefficient adjustment factor but they may experience changes during a flood event in addition to these limitations this research only focuses on spillways in river diversion work hence investigating the results of this research on storage dams is highly recommended and is left for further studies also only triangular fuzzy numbers representing each uncertain parameter are implemented here thus comprehensive research for investigating the other type of fuzzy numbers such as the trapezoidal and gaussian membership functions remains ahead of work for future investigation besides the climate change effect on hydrologic parameters such as rainfall intensity and runoff coefficient is not considered here so future studies should focus on the consequence of climate change on these parameters in this paper due to topographic conditions spillway length is limited to an interval in each case study then the required spillway height intervals for three recurrence intervals are obtained so optimizing the spillway dimension with fuzzy techniques has not been pursued here and is left behind for future work 10 summary the estimation of discharge and the capacity to convey that discharge are core activities for spillway design however these two components are subjected to hydrologic and hydraulic uncertainties so a new fuzzy methodology is introduced here for an ogee spillway design in a diversion dam considering those two kinds of uncertain components since the return period and risk of failure are related quantities the fuzzy methodology is applied here to study risk based on the hydrological return period discharge the uncertainties related to hydraulic and hydrologic parameters including the rainfall intensity catchment runoff coefficient and spillway discharge coefficient are endowed with triangular fuzzy numbers representing all possible values of the uncertain parameters may have then the rational formula and later the discharge rate equation for an ogee spillway are analyzed here using triangular fuzzy numbers to obtain the fuzzy products of the peak runoff and spillway discharge capacity on the basis that both must match the risk is calculated using the difference between both tfns quantities via three various fuzzy arithmetic operations then for three recurrence intervals 25 50 and 100 years the spillway dimension is obtained assuming risk annual exceedance probability equal to 1 t in which t is the return period for instance for a 100 year recurrence interval 1 risk in case study 1 the required spillway height varies between 2 714 m and 2 24 m corresponding to the spillway length interval limited between 60 and 80 m the results of this study in case study 1 indicate that the return period method fails to design an ogee crest accurately underestimating around 78 68 and 62 less than the required spillway dimensions obtained from the fuzzy theory in 25 50 and 100 years intervals respectively given our finding for calculating the fuzzy product of peak runoff using rational formula the standard approximation for arithmetic operations closely tracks the alpha cut analytical technique overestimating only 0 11 m3 s for the condition stated in case study 1 this paper methodology is performed for spillway design in two other study areas in iran indicating that the fuzzy technique calculates the spillway height 25 and 31 on average more than the conventional return period method for the al and tamar study areas respectively 11 conclusions a new fuzzy approach for spillway design is introduced here which is appropriate for basins with short rainfall runoff records beyond that though this study proves that the fuzzy technique outperforms the conventional return period approach for designing an ogee spillway obtaining a larger spillway dimension also the conventional method does not consider efficiently the uncertainty involved in hydraulic and hydrologic parameters underestimation of uncertainty related to hydrologic model parameters e g spillway discharge coefficient during a flood event leads to a poor design of a hydraulic structure to convey design discharge and demonstrating why many catastrophic dam failure events over the past century occurred due to insufficient infrastructure capacity contrary to the return period approach the proposed fuzzy framework for spillway design focuses on the catchment s runoff coefficient providing a state of the art technique for assessing climate change conditions nevertheless the proposed fuzzy method is restricted by the presence of idf curves and at least three rainfall runoff data provided that only three rainfall runoff events corresponding to historical flood events are available this method represents a promising approach for spillway design which is a potential direction for future research besides if the fuzzy approach is to implement for spillway design this study illustrated that the standard approximation for fuzzy arithmetic operation provides a time saving tool while preserving acceptable accuracy for calculations data availability statement all data models and code generated or used during the study appear in the submitted article the available data is listed in tables 2 to 8 credit

2540,this paper provides a fuzzy methodology based on calculating the hydrological return period discharge and the resistance load theory for designing an ogee spillway in a diversion dam hence the uncertainties of rainfall intensity catchment runoff coefficient and spillway discharge coefficient are endowed with triangular fuzzy numbers tfns describing possible values the uncertain parameters may have to do so the rational formula and later the spillway discharge equation are analyzed here to obtain the fuzzy products of the peak runoff and spillway discharge capacity on the basis that both must match the risk is calculated using the difference between the obtained fuzzy product quantities with three fuzzy arithmetic operations it is observed that the standard approximation closely tracks the result of the alpha cut exact method providing a time saving tool for fuzzy calculations since the return period t and risk of failure are related quantities the spillway dimensions are calculated for several recurrence intervals assuming risk equal to 1 t then the fuzzy approach is compared with the conventional return period approach for the design of an ogee crest in three experimental catchments in iran with adequate historical data the result indicates that the fuzzy technique outperforms the conventional return period approach for designing an ogee spillway obtaining an average 29 larger spillway dimension in all case studies beyond that the fuzzy procedure is applied to another catchment with short rainfall runoff data which is impossible to implement the conventional return period method for the hydrologic design of an ogee spillway keywords hydrologic uncertainty triangular fuzzy number rainfall runoff data diversion work return period approach data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction many catastrophic dam failure events due to overtopping over the past centuries proved that conventional procedure fails to work accurately abrishamchi et al 2003 marengo 2006 the traditional design approaches of hydro system infrastructure are classified into four categories tung et al 2006 in the first method the hydro system is designed based on its capability to withstand previous historical flood events cœur and lang 2008 li et al 2020 the second approach is widely used globally for hydrological design in which the design discharge is determined based on frequency analysis of annual peak flow records read and vogel 2015 stedinger 2000 vogel and castellarin 2017 in an appropriate return period however when the historical data is scarce or it is impossible to know the probability distribution of the input data this method is not particularly helpful benson 1960 besides in the return period approach a unique probability distribution is selected as the best fitting distribution rezazadeh baghal and khodashenas 2022 but due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation the peak flood series may follow different or various probability distribution functions salas et al 2013 stedinger et al 1993 contrary to the historical event based and return period approaches the risk based and optimal risk based approaches consider the inherent hydrologic uncertainties afshar et al 2009 tung and bao 1990 tung and mays 1981 however to develop these two models a knowledge of the probability distributions of the resistance and load random components variables is required which is not readily available in literature these two random components are assumed to follow normal or triangular probability distributions for instance afshar et al 1994 presented an optimization model in a river diversion work that incorporates the dimensions of the system component and the diversion design flood uncertainties with triangular and normal probability distributions respectively karamouz et al 2018 assumed that the resistance and load random components have a standard normal distribution but this assumption cannot always be taken for granted several fuzzy approaches have been proposed in hydraulic and hydrologic modeling to overcome the limitations of probabilistic methods particularly with fuzzy numbers for instance yang et al 2013 used tfns for flood risk evaluation and response measures analysis li et al 2018 obtained the risk degree of flash floods by implementing trapezoidal fuzzy numbers huang et al 2010 presented a coupling fuzzy vertex analysis technique for hydrological modeling associated with imprecise information maskey et al 2004 combined a fuzzy set theory with a genetic algorithm for propagating the precipitation uncertainty through a deterministic rainfall runoff routing model for flood forecasting nasseri et al 2014 proposed a new fuzzy arithmetic operator based on the fuzzy extension principle for assessing uncertainty in two monthly water balance models ghorbani mooselu et al 2019 employed a fuzzy transformation method to address the uncertainty in flood flow rate for the stepped spillway design maroufpoor et al 2019 explored a newly developed artificial intelligence model for simulating soil moisture content with the aim of a hybrid adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system with the grey wolf optimizer algorithm the return period and risk of failure are related quantities salas et al 2013 the risk based design approaches mainly incorporate this concept using the well known load resistance theory also the fuzzy risk approach implements the load resistance theory as well which was first introduced by shrestha et al 1990 to assess the reliability of a flood levee structure since then the fuzzy approach for assessing the risk of a hydro system has received increasing attention for instance su and wen 2013 assumed resistance force and load as fuzzy numbers to conduct a fuzzy risk model for the instability risk assessment of gravity dams rezazadeh baghal and khodashenas 2022 used the fuzzy risk concept to optimize the design of a rectangular canal where fuzzy numbers represent the load and resistance obtained from the rational formula and manning equation respectively again rezazadeh baghal and khodashenas 2022 assessed the risk of flooding in a storm sewer with the load and resistance theory and the hydrological return period discharge implementing the fuzzy alpha cut principle and the monte carlo simulation all rainfall runoff models and in the broader sense hydrologic models follow the load and resistance theory as well drawing the attention of many researchers in recent two decades chang and chen 2001 chang et al 2017 cheng et al 2002 özelkan and duckstein 2001 for instance chang et al 2018 used the self adaptive fuzzy inference network for the rainfall runoff modeling zhou et al 2019 proposed a recurrent adaptive network based fuzzy inference system embedded with the genetic algorithm capturing the features of the non stationary process between rainfall and runoff series for making multi step ahead flood forecasts jacquin and shamseldin 2006 explored the application of the takagi sugeno fuzzy inference system to rainfall runoff modeling to describe the non linear relationship between rainfall as an input and runoff as an output ashrafi et al 2017 implemented a neuro fuzzy model for forecasting rainfall runoff and river routing in basins with limited data morales et al 2021 introduced a self identification neuro fuzzy inference model to reduce the uncertainty of the rainfall and runoff lags and the number of membership functions required in a fuzzy system diversion dams provide and regulate water by diverting water from a river into an irrigation canal and may serve to flood control purposes diversion dams have been widely used globally but staggeringly few resources on the risk based design of diversion dams are available in the literature for instance afshar and mariño 1990 proposed a model to incorporate the uncertainty of the flood magnitude estimation for the optimal design of spillway capacity abrishamchi et al 2003 considered hydrological uncertainties involved in the flood routing process to estimate flood magnitude and then integrated them into an optimization model for spillway design alongside the above methods this study provides a state of the art fuzzy risk based design technique for designing an ogee spillway contrary to the probabilistic risk based approach the proposed fuzzy technique does not need the probability distribution of the involved uncertain random parameters also unlike the conventional return period method the long series of the annual peak flood records is not required in the introduced fuzzy method beyond that this paper s results indicate that the conventional return period method underestimates the spillway dimension in addition the entire uncertain hydraulic and hydrologic parameters involved in designing an ogee spillway in a diversion dam as the other gap in the available literature are put in focus here furthermore this study proves if the approximation technique is to select for the fuzzy arithmetic operation the result of the standard approximation method is closely tracking the output of the alpha cut principle this kind of comparison is absent in the current literature the fuzzy theory is used here to study risk in designing spillways based on calculating the hydrological return period discharge so the rational formula and later the discharge rate formula for an ogee spillway are analyzed here using triangular fuzzy numbers to obtain the fuzzy products of the peak runoff and spillway discharge capacity since both fuzzy products must match the risk is calculated using the difference between their quantities as the integral of the negative portion to the entire area of their difference fuzzy membership functions are applied to all parameters in rational and spillway discharge equations except the basin area which is constant here then the required spillway dimension is calculated for several recurrence intervals assuming risk annual exceedance probability equal to 1 t in which t is the return period then the fuzzy methodology and traditional return period method are applied to three case studies in iran surrounded by synoptic weather stations with adequate annual peak flow records and then the results of the two techniques are compared in the final step the fuzzy methodology is applied to design an ogee spillway in another case study in iran suffering from a poor historical record as a mere nine rainfall runoff data is available hence this paper is structured as described in fig 1 2 general concept of triangular fuzzy numbers a triangular fuzzy number a can be defined as a a b c where a b and c denote its lower medium and upper number in which an inequality of a b c must be satisfied a fuzzy number a is a triangular fuzzy number tfn if its membership function μ a is given by 1 μ a x 0 x a x c x a b a a x b c x c b b x c 2 1 description left and right l r representation for fuzzy number a fuzzy number a is a generalized l r type fuzzy number if its membership function is given by 2 μ a x l a 1 x α a 1 α x a 1 1 a 1 x a 2 r x a 2 β a 2 x a 2 β where a 1 a 2 are the shoulders of a the support of a is a 1 α a 2 β as depicted in fig 2 with a 1 a 2 and l x r x 1 x the l r fuzzy number in eq 2 becomes a triangular fuzzy number 3 fuzzy risk technique based on approximated arithmetic operation under the nonlinear operation of fuzzy multiplication and division tfns are not invariant since the result of these operations is a polynomial membership function the approximation methods are linear approximation for fuzzy multiplication and division and only approximate the actual result by the triangular shape for fuzzy arithmetic operations two approximation methods named standard approximation and the l r type fuzzy number introduced first by dubois and prade 1980 are implemented here 3 1 fuzzy risk product based on the l r fuzzy type the fuzzy risk product may define as being the difference between the two fuzzy number products representing the resistance q r lr and the load q l lr respectively the l r type of the fuzzy risk product is defined as 3 z lr q r lr q l lr the risk may be defined as the integral of the negative portion of z lr to the entire area of the fuzzy risk product in the task of spillway design the load and resistance are defined based on the rational formula and spillway discharge equation the two uncertain parameters in the rational formula are rainfall intensity and catchment runoff coefficient represented by tfns the rational formula is obtained as below 4 ql 1 3 6 c f c i a where ql peak flow m3 s c runoff coefficient i rainfall intensity mm h a drainage area km2 and c f is the runoff coefficient adjustment factor the value of c f is listed in table 1 the discharge over an ogee spillway is given by equation 5 qr c d l h 3 2 qr discharge m3 s c d discharge coefficient l effective length of crest m and h actual head of the spillway m the uncertain parameter in the spillway discharge equation is the discharge coefficient represented by tfn hence the aim of this research is to obtain the spillway dimension when c d c and i are uncertain parameters based on eq 3 the l r type fuzzy risk product m3 s is given as below 6 z lr l h 3 2 c d 2 a 3 6 c f c 2 i 2 l h 3 2 c d 2 c d 1 a 3 6 c f c 2 i 2 i 1 c f i 2 c 3 c 2 l h 3 2 c d 3 c d 2 a 3 6 c f c 2 i 3 i 2 i 2 c f c 2 c 1 where cd c d 1 c d 2 c d 3 c c 1 c 2 c 3 and i i 1 i 2 i 3 are triangular fuzzy numbers hence the limit values z 1 z 3 and the most likely value z 2 of the triangular fuzzy risk product are obtained as below 7 z lr z 1 l h 3 2 c d 2 a 3 6 c f c 2 i 2 l h 3 2 c d 2 c d 1 a 3 6 c f c 2 i 2 i 1 i 2 c f c 3 c 2 z 2 l h 3 2 c d 2 a 3 6 c f c 2 i 2 z 3 l h 3 2 c d 2 a 3 6 c f c 2 i 2 l h 3 2 c d 3 c d 2 a 3 6 c f c 2 i 3 i 2 i 2 c f c 2 c 1 since the membership function for the fuzzy risk product in eq 6 is linear having the three points of the triangular fuzzy number at hand eq 7 the value of negative z lr and the fuzzy risk value is readily calculatable as shown in fig 3 3 2 fuzzy risk product based on the standard approximation based on standard approximation arithmetic operations giachetti and young 1997 the approximated triangular fuzzy risk product m3 s is given as below 8 z sp q r sp q l sp c d 1 l h 3 2 a 3 6 c f c 3 i 3 c d 2 l h 3 2 a 3 6 c f c 2 i 2 c d 3 l h 3 2 a 3 6 c f c 1 i 1 similarly the membership function of standard approximation is a triangle so three points of this triangle eq 8 gives the risk value 4 fuzzy risk product based on an analytical arithmetic operation in the alpha cut arithmetic operation calculations are made for α 0 1 to drive a parabolic curve representing the actual product based on the alpha cut arithmetic operations chaira 2019 the actual fuzzy risk product is given as below 9 z α q r α q l α l h 3 2 c d 1 c d 2 c d 1 α a

y 1 c d 1 c d 2 2 p 2 2 c 3 c d 1 i 2 c d 2 i 2 2 i 3 c 2 c d 2 i 3 c d 1 i 3 2 i 2 p c f a 3 6 c 3 i 2 c 2 i 3 2 c f 2 a 2 3 6 2 14 y 2 c d 2 c d 3 2 p 2 2 c 2 c d 2 i 1 c d 3 i 1 2 i 2 c 1 c d 3 i 2

a c f 3 3 6 c 3 i 2 c 2 i 3 c 1 i 2 c 2 i 1 hence based on eqs 9 12 and 15 the fuzzy risk is obtained as shown in fig 4 16 risk 1 f o r z 2 0 0 5 α 3 3 6 s 3 3 6 p c d 1 α 2 α c d 2 i 3 3 2 α 2 α i 2

the risk value obtained by the alpha cut principle is mathematically complex and needs cumbersome calculation 5 overview of the study areas the fuzzy theory is used here to study risk in designing spillways of four sites the first two sites have adequate runoff rainfall and annual peak flow data which is appropriate for implementing both the conventional return period and fuzzy approaches the third site has suitable annual peak runoff data but only four rainfall runoff records related to historical flood events are available the last study area has only limited rainfall runoff recorded impeding the usage of the return period approach for calculating the design discharge so only the fuzzy methodology is implemented here to obtain the spillway dimension 5 1 case studies 1 2 the first study area is the firizi catchment fig 5 extending from 3630 126 to 3623 95 and from 59 2 2 to 58 49 3 and the second site is al basin fig 6 located from 3638 979 to 3658 445 and from 5939 875 to 5928 561 which is a part of the kardeh dam s catchment both sites are located near mashhad known as the second largest city in iran and the center of the khorasan razavi province according to köppen geiger s climate classification system two study locations have a bsk cold and semi arid climate the firizi and al basin areas are 283 km2 and 437 km2 respectively based on the reports of meteorological stations the firizi and al study areas receive approximately 430 mm and 374 mm of annual precipitation in addition the average slope of the firizi and al basins is 11 4 and 44 2 while their main river slope is 6 3 and 2 31 the firizi and al main river length is 22 7 km and 46 8 km respectively since 1985 the runoff data and its corresponding rainfall hyetographs have been recorded in hydrometric stations and several synoptic weather stations surrounding and inside both study areas the spillway length in the frizi and al catchments is restricted between 60 m and 80 m and between 55 m and 65 m respectively due to topographic limitations 5 2 case study 3 the tamar catchment is a part of the gorganroud river basin located in golestan province iran which is extended from the northwest of khorasan province to the caspian sea on its eastern side from 3725 155 to 3747 795 and from 5529 606 to 564 784 the basin area is 1524 km2 and its average slope is 19 5 also the main river length is 117 km and its average slope is 1 7 the suitable spillway length in this site is between 140 and 160 m fig 7 shows the study area and the location of the hydrometric station 5 3 case study 4 kaleh vellayat catchment fig 8 extends from 3659 26 to 3654 25 and from 58 5 6 to 5734 3 this basin covers an area of 723 km2 the outlet of the study area is very close to esfarayen city about 20 km known as the third largest city in the khorasan shomali province north of iran according to köppen and geiger s climate classification system the study area has a cold semi arid bsk climate based on the reports of meteorological stations esfarayen city received an approximation of 247 1 mm of annual precipitation also the average slope of the basin and the main river is 14 and 1 respectively the main river length is 62 7 km the hydrometric station is placed at the basin outlet to measure runoff from the study area due to topographic conditions the spillway length is limited between 80 and 100 m 6 description of the selected uncertain parameters the uncertain parameters involved in the rational formula and spillway discharge equation in both study areas are discussed as below 6 1 basin area a since the catchment area naturally is not uncertain it is considered a single valued fixed parameter here 6 2 runoff coefficient adjustment factor c f this parameter value is connected to the selection of storm recurrence interval as listed in table 1 so it is not considered as an uncertain parameter here 6 3 runoff coefficient c the tfn representing the runoff coefficient is calculated based on available rainfall records including 11 and 23 records that contributed to annual peak discharge for case studies 1 and 2 respectively and only four rainfall events related to historical flood events for case study 3 also the tfn c is determined based on short rainfall runoff data for case study 4 tables 2 to 5 provide rainfall runoff scenarios in each site highlighting the runoff coefficient c obtained from each rainfall event so the limit interval of the tfn c is equal to the minimum and maximum value of the obtained runoff coefficients in each case study in addition the most likely value of the tfn c is the mean value of the calculated runoff coefficient fig 9 provides the tfn representing the runoff coefficients contributed to each study area 6 4 rainfall intensity i the maximum flood discharge occurs when the rainfall duration is equal to the time of concentration of the basin the time of concentration is given as below yen et al 1983 17 t c 1 2 nl s 0 5 0 6 where n is manning s roughness coefficient of the catchment l is the mainstream s length and s is the average slope of the main water line the parameters contributed in eq 17 were illustrated in the overview study areas section for each study area the accepted range for manning s n in catchment scale for both sites may vary between 0 03 and 0 07 benson and dalrymple 1967 marcus et al 1992 considering the lower and upper limits for sandy soil and mountain streams with large boulders respectively so based on eq 17 the limit interval and the most likely value when manning s n is equal to 0 05 of time of concentrations for each study area is obtained then available idf curves are implemented to calculate tfns representing the rainfall intensities mm h in three recurrence intervals as listed in table 6 6 5 spillway discharge coefficient c d the non dimensional coefficient of discharge c d is obtained from the expression 18 q 2 3 c d l 2 g h 3 the range of variation of c d is from 0 578 corresponding to the broad crested spillway to 0 75 corresponding to the highest attainable value without exceeding permissible sub atmospheric pressures on the ogee crest khatsuria 2004 hence the limit values of the tfn representing the coefficient of discharge are 0 578 and 0 75 regarding an ogee crest spillway since the upstream pool of the diversion dam can fully accumulate with sediment spillway approach depth becomes almost zero the spillway discharge coefficient can reduce to 0 578 equal to the discharge coefficient of a board crest spillway moreover the upstream pool accumulated sediment level is changing erratically during flood events so the mean of the limit values 0 578 and 0 75 is considered the most likely value of tfn c d fig 10 shows the tfn c d in an ogee crest 7 conventional return period method for spillway design flood frequency analysis based on serially annual peak flow data is the first step of the return period method for spillway design estimating peak flow magnitude for the selected recurrence interval the annual peak flows for case studies 1 to 3 are listed in tables 7 to 9 then after the calculation of the spillway dimension an extra height is added to the maximum upstream pool water surface this freeboard recompenses the uncertainty related to several parameters i e the method of estimating floods reduction of spillway discharge capacity due to debris and other unforeseen future events associated with upstream and downstream development typically for considering freeboard in spillway design an empirical relationship is used consisting of a function of depth of flow d and average flow velocity v as below fb m v m s and d m 19 fb 0 6096 0 03714 v d 1 3 8 results 8 1 design discharge based on the return period approach for case studies 1 to 3 the hyfran plus computer program is used here to fit the suitable statistical distribution s of the data listed in tables 7 to 9 considering 95 confidence limits based on bayesian and akaike information criteria the gamma distribution obtained the best fit for 25 50 and 100 year recurrence intervals in both study areas 1 2 it is observed that the annual maximum flow data in the tamar study area follow the lognormal distribution the design discharges are listed in table 10 fig 11 a shows the required dimension of the ogee spillway based on the fuzzy methodology exact method and the conventional return period technique in various risk values 1 2 and 4 corresponding to 100 50 25 year recurrence intervals in case study 1 moreover the result of the fuzzy theory for spillway design based on three arithmetic operations alpha cut l r fuzzy type standard approximation as well as the return period approach is depicted in fig 11b 11c and 11d and tabulated in table 11 for 25 4 risk 50 2 risk and 100 1 risk year recurrence intervals in case study 1 8 2 fuzzy methodology vs return period method for the ogee crest design it is observed that the conventional return period method underestimates the required spillway dimensions compared to the fuzzy methodology for various recurrence intervals in the first three case studies and by increasing the return period their difference becomes more significant for instance for 25 and 100 year recurrence intervals in case study 1 the difference between the required ogee height in a 60 m spillway length in fuzzy and return period methods is 0 479 m and 1 085 m respectively the reason is by increasing the recurrence interval the freeboard s value only changes slightly increasing from 0 684 m to 0 704 m for 60 m spillway length in the two return periods 25 and 100 year return periods moreover by increasing the spillway length the difference between the fuzzy and conventional return period methods decreased gradually for instance in 80 m spillway length and 25 and 100 year recurrence intervals in case study 1 the differences in the required spillway height between the fuzzy and conventional approaches are decreased to 0 288 m and 0 786 m also the results of the fuzzy technique and the return period method for the ogee spillway design of case study 2 fig 12 and its corresponding table 12 and case study 3 table 13 provide a similar trend obtaining a larger spillway dimension when the fuzzy technique is implemented for instance in case study 3 in which only four rainfall runoff records of historical flood events are available the fuzzy methodology calculates the spillway height about 32 on average more than the return period technique 8 3 error analysis of fuzzy arithmetic operators for spillway design the error of the two approximation methods at a given alpha level is the difference between approximated membership function and the actual one obtained by the alpha cut method the principal source of error between approximation and analytical techniques is the difference between the straight line approximation and the exact polynomial shape of fuzzy products the result of standard approximation in spillway design is very close to the analytical solution overestimating to a maximum 0 01 m ogee crest height when its length is 60 m the errors of the l r fuzzy type are more significant than the standard approximation method underestimating the spillway heights to a maximum of 0 111 m 0 141 m and 0 167 m in 25 50 and 100 year recurrence intervals when the spillway length is 60 m to illustrate the superiority of the standard approximation method over the l r fuzzy type the peak runoff fuzzy product with three arithmetic operation methods in the 25 year recurrence interval based on tfn c and tfn i in case study 1 is shown in fig 13 a it is observed that the maximum error in the l r fuzzy type arithmetic operation is at its base points shifted to the left of the exact method s curve moreover the maximum error in standard approximation arithmetic operation occurs when α 0 5 moving to the left right of the alpha cut curve means the amount of load peak runoff magnitude is underestimated overestimated and it explains why the l r fuzzy type and the standard approximation methods for arithmetic operation underestimate and overestimate the spillway dimension respectively since only two tfns tfn c and tfn i are multiplied to obtain the actual peak runoff fuzzy product the rational formula the highest power of alpha the degree of nonlinearity is two so the multiplication of a fuzzy product by another tfn results in a higher alpha power hypothetically consider three parameters involved in the rational formula c i and cf as triangular fuzzy numbers cf was a fixed parameter for calculating the peak runoff fuzzy product in eqs 7 8 and 16 if the power of alpha increased the error associated with the two approximation methods increased slightly as shown in fig 13b the maximum and mean horizontal distances between the curve and the two lines in fig 13a and 13b is tabulated in table 14 8 4 case study 4 this site kaleh vellayat catchment suffers from poor historical records as only nine rainfall runoff data for a mere five water year are available as listed in table 5 since the annual peak flood magnitude is not recorded here the fuzzy methodology based on the hydrological return period discharge is implemented to design the ogee crest hence the required ogee crest dimensions for 25 50 and 100 year recurrence intervals 4 2 and 1 risk respectively are illustrated in fig 14 and table 15 9 discussion the conventional return period method requires a series of consecutive annual peak flow data to estimate peak flow magnitude for the selected recurrence interval but for many reasons such as a lack of historical data this method is not particularly helpful moreover through frequency analysis of the annual peak flow data the result may fit several probability distributions or sometimes it is impossible to find any probability distribution these limitations and deficiencies privileged the fuzzy methodology for spillway design requiring at least three rainfall runoff data related to storm events the fuzzy approach for the spillway design was investigated with the data of three case studies in iran with adequate annual peak runoff values and the corresponding rainfall data given our finding the conventional return period method underestimates the required spillway dimension proving that the available standard criteria need reconsideration hence the superiorities of the proposed fuzzy methodology over the conventional method for ogee crest spillway design are twofold first the fuzzy technique obtains a larger spillway dimension proving that the return period method fails to work appropriately second when the historical record annual peak flood is scarce and it is impossible to estimate the design flood with the probabilistic criteria the fuzzy technique is privileged requiring at least three rainfall runoff data to perform the ogee crest design as we confront in the kaleh vellayat catchment case study 4 normally the hydrologic design of a spillway is merely based on a single random variable known as the annual peak discharge in other words the traditional return period approach does not include the runoff coefficient which can vary in each rainfall scenario but the proposed fuzzy technique is based on analyzing the rational formula considering the limit interval of the runoff coefficient as a result the traditional method fails to consider the climate change condition in which the upper limit of the runoff coefficient and the rainfall intensity may increase significantly regarding the ogee spillway discharge capacity the traditional design criterion is to consider a relatively fixed amount about 0 75 for the spillway discharge coefficient but due to the presence of debris and other mechanisms this coefficient may decrease during a flood event however a freeboard is added as an extra height of the spillway representing all uncertainties involved in the hydraulic and hydrologic uncertainties but this study proved that by increasing the recurrence interval from 25 year to 100 year freeboard only increases less than 3 on the other hand the fuzzy methodology incorporates any possible values of the spillway discharge coefficient with a triangular fuzzy number changing between 0 578 representing a broad crest spillway and 0 75 during a flood event besides the fuzzy technique with the alpha cut principle leads to the introduction of a cumbersome equation for the risk value calculation eq 16 so two approximation methods for the fuzzy operation are implemented here to reduce the calculation time it is observed that outputs of the standard approximation for the fuzzy arithmetic operation closely track the result of the alpha cut method and its error is significantly lower than the l r fuzzy type technique the exact difference between the three fuzzy arithmetic operations is mutable things changing with recurrence intervals and spillway dimension thus in the task of spillway design the standard approximation for arithmetic operation preserves acceptable accuracy providing a time saving tool for practicing engineers the proposed fuzzy methodology has the following limitations first at least three rainfall runoff data related to flood events are required second the rainfall intensity is assumed to be uniform throughout experimental catchments over the time of concentration and finally some parameters in the rational and spillway discharge equations are constant here i e the runoff coefficient adjustment factor but they may experience changes during a flood event in addition to these limitations this research only focuses on spillways in river diversion work hence investigating the results of this research on storage dams is highly recommended and is left for further studies also only triangular fuzzy numbers representing each uncertain parameter are implemented here thus comprehensive research for investigating the other type of fuzzy numbers such as the trapezoidal and gaussian membership functions remains ahead of work for future investigation besides the climate change effect on hydrologic parameters such as rainfall intensity and runoff coefficient is not considered here so future studies should focus on the consequence of climate change on these parameters in this paper due to topographic conditions spillway length is limited to an interval in each case study then the required spillway height intervals for three recurrence intervals are obtained so optimizing the spillway dimension with fuzzy techniques has not been pursued here and is left behind for future work 10 summary the estimation of discharge and the capacity to convey that discharge are core activities for spillway design however these two components are subjected to hydrologic and hydraulic uncertainties so a new fuzzy methodology is introduced here for an ogee spillway design in a diversion dam considering those two kinds of uncertain components since the return period and risk of failure are related quantities the fuzzy methodology is applied here to study risk based on the hydrological return period discharge the uncertainties related to hydraulic and hydrologic parameters including the rainfall intensity catchment runoff coefficient and spillway discharge coefficient are endowed with triangular fuzzy numbers representing all possible values of the uncertain parameters may have then the rational formula and later the discharge rate equation for an ogee spillway are analyzed here using triangular fuzzy numbers to obtain the fuzzy products of the peak runoff and spillway discharge capacity on the basis that both must match the risk is calculated using the difference between both tfns quantities via three various fuzzy arithmetic operations then for three recurrence intervals 25 50 and 100 years the spillway dimension is obtained assuming risk annual exceedance probability equal to 1 t in which t is the return period for instance for a 100 year recurrence interval 1 risk in case study 1 the required spillway height varies between 2 714 m and 2 24 m corresponding to the spillway length interval limited between 60 and 80 m the results of this study in case study 1 indicate that the return period method fails to design an ogee crest accurately underestimating around 78 68 and 62 less than the required spillway dimensions obtained from the fuzzy theory in 25 50 and 100 years intervals respectively given our finding for calculating the fuzzy product of peak runoff using rational formula the standard approximation for arithmetic operations closely tracks the alpha cut analytical technique overestimating only 0 11 m3 s for the condition stated in case study 1 this paper methodology is performed for spillway design in two other study areas in iran indicating that the fuzzy technique calculates the spillway height 25 and 31 on average more than the conventional return period method for the al and tamar study areas respectively 11 conclusions a new fuzzy approach for spillway design is introduced here which is appropriate for basins with short rainfall runoff records beyond that though this study proves that the fuzzy technique outperforms the conventional return period approach for designing an ogee spillway obtaining a larger spillway dimension also the conventional method does not consider efficiently the uncertainty involved in hydraulic and hydrologic parameters underestimation of uncertainty related to hydrologic model parameters e g spillway discharge coefficient during a flood event leads to a poor design of a hydraulic structure to convey design discharge and demonstrating why many catastrophic dam failure events over the past century occurred due to insufficient infrastructure capacity contrary to the return period approach the proposed fuzzy framework for spillway design focuses on the catchment s runoff coefficient providing a state of the art technique for assessing climate change conditions nevertheless the proposed fuzzy method is restricted by the presence of idf curves and at least three rainfall runoff data provided that only three rainfall runoff events corresponding to historical flood events are available this method represents a promising approach for spillway design which is a potential direction for future research besides if the fuzzy approach is to implement for spillway design this study illustrated that the standard approximation for fuzzy arithmetic operation provides a time saving tool while preserving acceptable

2541,the relationship between snowmelt and spring streamflow is changing under warming temperatures and diminishing snowpack at the same time the hydrologic connectivity across catchment landscape elements such as snowpack and surface wetlands can play a critical role in controlling the routing of snowmelt to streams the role of hydrologic connectivity is important in headwater regions of the continental northern latitudes where catchments have low topographic relief and seasonally frozen ground nevertheless the effects of soil frost on the sequence timing and magnitudes of hydrologic events that drive the movement of water from a snowpack to a stream are not fully understood therefore we examine two questions first what is the flowpath that snow melt and precipitation from spring rain events takes to generate spring streamflow and second what hydrologic climatic or landscape variables exert the most control on the magnitude of streamflow here we use long term hydrological records from the two reference basins at the marcell experimental forest in northern minnesota to analyze the cascading effects across precipitation snow water table elevation soil frost and streamflow in peatland dominated headwater catchments we identify a sequence of fill and spill effects across the landscape that control the timing of spring streamflow generation then we use stepwise regression to show that soil frost is a key supporting predictor for both the magnitude of streamflow in the spring as it adds significantly to the predictive power of precipitation and water table elevation our results highlight the importance of recognizing the role of soil frost when present on the partitioning of snowmelt between overland runoff and water table recharge during the critical snowmelt period as well as the later partitioning between evapotranspiration and subsurface flows keywords peatlands streamflow generation long term data snow data availability published data sources are made available at the end of the document 1 introduction in snow dominated seasonally frozen catchments spring streamflow timing and magnitude have been affected by a warming winter climate for instance estimates have shown that over the last century spring streamflow peaks have shifted earlier by 4 5 to 8 6 days in the northern hemisphere hodgkins and dudley 2006 and 8 7 to 14 3 days in the north central united states ryberg et al 2016 these shifts in streamflow responses partially result from decreases in snow pack size ford et al 2020 including shifts in precipitation from snow to rain decreasing snowfall fraction or the portion of precipitation falling in the form of snow within a single catchment has been shown to lead to earlier spring streamflow peaks barnett et al 2005 as well as decreases in mean annual streamflow berghuijs et al 2014 foster et al 2016 however the influence of snow fraction on streamflow can be complicated by the direct effects of warming air temperature on the rate of snowmelt faster snowmelt rates which can occur when spring warming arrives earlier have been shown to lead to larger spring streamflow peaks and increased runoff and flood risk trujillo and molotch 2014 at the same time warming temperatures can also increase surface energy and evapotranspiration later in the spring which can have a counteracting effect that decreases streamflow badger et al 2021 even so the relative importance of snow fraction versus temperature driven land surface evaporative loss on streamflow remains unclear with studies showing that either could serve as a dominant driver of streamflow in different future climate scenarios foster et al 2016 therefore the complex interactions among climate snow and hydrological processes as the spring progresses remains an open research question the climatic effects on streamflow are mediated by the hydrologic connectivity on the landscape which is controlled by a range of surface and subsurface storage components that accelerate or inhibit the flow pathways connecting water as precipitation inputs to streamflow pringle 2003 for instance snow water equivalent swe the total amount of water stored in a snowpack represents a temporary storage of precipitation in a frozen state on the land surface until it is released during the spring as snowmelt this storage behavior temporarily halts the flow of water until it becomes available in liquid form again musselman et al 2021 as such the timing of snow disappearance and the duration of snowmelt period exhibit strong influence on snowmelt runoff streamflow peaks and overall water availability in the spring the relationships between snowmelt and streamflow are commonly studied in sites monitored using the snotel network in the western united states leuthold et al 2021 heldmyer et al 2021 trujillo and molotch 2014 where due to the well defined surface topography and bedrock geology in mountainous regions the flow path from snowmelt to streamflow is fairly direct schneider and molotch 2016 surface wetlands represents another storage for precipitation surface wetlands may occur in areas of low topographic relief and water within wetlands is stored until the water table elevation wte increases over a threshold elevation causing overland flow or lateral flow out of the wetland the wte to streamflow relationship is often the focus in studies on geographically isolated wetlands which demonstrate clear connectivity among precipitation wte and surface runoff cohen et al 2016 golden et al 2016 verry et al 2011 in geographically isolated wetlands the wte is the most important predictor of landscape connectivity because it determines the level of isolation between the wetland and its surrounding surface water bodies winter and labaugh 2003 as the height of the water table rises above the wetland surface levels the excess water flows over the landscape to a surrounding stream demonstrating the fill and spill flow dynamics characteristic of hydrologic storage mechanisms cohen et al 2016 winter and labaugh 2003 mcdonnell et al 2021 leibowitz and vining 2003 despite the importance of snowpack and wetlands in determining the connectivity to and therefore timing and magnitude of streamflow these near surface storage components have rarely been studied together especially in conjunction with another important landscape driver soil frost in areas of seasonally frozen ground air temperature snow and soil moisture content control frost depths which influence the snowmelt partitioning between overland flow and subsurface recharge aygün et al 2019 verry et al 2011 frozen ground restricts the infiltration of snowmelt and water table recharge thereby increasing surface runoff zhao and gray 1999 kane and stein 1983 the combined effects of rising winter temperatures and shrinking snowpack will also reduce the frost layer resulting in an overall increase in the rate of groundwater recharge due to earlier snow melt and higher infiltration rates jyrkama and sykes 2007 the importance of frost is dependent on a diverse range of factors some of which are difficult to predict or remain uncertain while frost is more likely to affect streamflow in small catchments cold climates and forested land cover can limit the effects frost has on streamflow ala aho et al 2021 for example a soil frost model developed using data from a catchment in northern sweden showed no clear effect of soil frost on either the timing or magnitude of streamflow runoff this lack of connection between frost and streamflow was likely due to limited frost occurrence frost formed in only slightly more than half the years or because the frost often had thawed before spring melt and streamflow onset lindström et al 2002 in contrast at a site in southern switzerland only 25 35 of the melt water infiltrated into the soil in a winter with thin snowpack and thick frost layer compared to 90 100 in a different winter that had a deep snowpack and thin frost layer bayard et al 2005 as the effect of frost is variable across catchments and its presence can greatly affect spring runoff it is important to consider that first soil frost can be quite heterogeneous across the landscape a variability that is not captured in soil profile studies zhao and gray 1999 kane and stein 1983 second soil frost varies from year to year depending on winter climate and precipitation capturing these spatial and temporal variations is key to better understanding the relationship between soil frost and streamflow generation in this study we use long term climatological and hydrological data to show a clear cascade of hydrological connectivity throughout the landscape and to determine the relative strengths of climatic and land surface variable in predicting annual streamflow trends peatlands provide an ideal environment in which to study interacting surface and subsurface flows in the spring snowmelt season the majority of peatlands are located in northern latitudes where seasonal soil frost is becoming more dynamic under climate change as soils transition from permanently frozen to seasonally frozen soils bridgham et al 2013 additionally wetlands including peatlands are the single largest natural source of methane contributing about a third of total global emissions gorham 1991 with methane emissions from peatlands strongly controlled by seasonal water table dynamics and snowmelt dynamics feng et al 2020 therefore it is critical to understand how the increasingly dynamic frost conditions will impact wetland water table and by consequence the role that peatlands play in both global and regional methane budgets regionally headwater streams and wetlands provide innumerable ecosystem services including regulating streamflow responses and improving downstream water quality colvin et al 2019 alexander et al 2007 this critical hydrological landscape provides the ideal location to examine the effects of shifting spring hydrologic cascades on the wider network of low relief catchments we focus on relationships among climate hydrology and landscape elements by examining two questions related to hydrologic connectivity in snow dominated low relief peatland catchments how do snow frost and surface wetlands mediate the flow paths from precipitation to spring streamflow and what hydrologic climatic or landscape variables most control the magnitude of streamflow as the effect of frost is variable across catchments and its presence can greatly affect spring runoff it is important to consider that first soil frost can be quite heterogeneous across the landscape a variability that is not captured in soil profile studies zhao and gray 1999 kane and stein 1983 second soil frost varies from year to year depending on winter climate and precipitation in this study we will examine these questions in two peatland catchments at the marcell experimental forest mef in northern minnesota usa using statistical approaches applied to the analysis of long term datasets by focusing on two watersheds with long data records we contribute new findings to both unresolved complexities of the importance of soil frost in forested catchments and expand upon existing soil profile event scale and modeling soil frost studies we first parameterize the processes that occur in the spring season by extracting key hydrological events from the long term time series and analyze the timing across each of these events through ranking then we use stepwise regression to identify the importance of winter and spring season variables for predicting annual streamflow together answers to these questions will illustrate the importance of considering soil frost in headwater catchments 2 methodology 2 1 site description our catchments are located within the usda forest service marcell experimental forest mef lat 47 31 52 n long 93 28 07 w near grand rapids minnesota usa the mef sits on the climatic transition region between areas of seasonally frozen ground and northern boreal regions and has six peatland dominated catchments that have been under long term observation since 1961 sebestyen et al 2011 the s2 and s5 research catchments are reference basins with central peatlands surrounded by upland forests on mineral soils records for these sites include hydrologic meteorological and water chemistry data sebestyen et al 2021b minnesota climate is strongly continental with warm humid summers and cold dry winters from 1961 to 2019 mean annual temperature at the catchments was 3 5 c sebestyen et al 2021b average annual temperature has been increasing by 0 4 c per decade since 1961 with the majority of the warming occurring over the winter months 37 january to march 0 7 c per decade annual precipitation averages 79 cm with one third of precipitation falling in the form of snow sebestyen et al 2021b snow cover in the peatland starts in late october and november and usually lasts until march or april of the following year there has been no change over time in maximum snow water equivalent under coniferous and open areas but significant decline under deciduous covers sebestyen et al 2011 2 1 1 south unit s2 bog the s2 watershed has a total size of 9 7 ha which is made up of a 3 2 ha domed peatland encircled by upland forests the upland vegetation is dominated by aspen populus tremuloides populus grandidentata stands the peatland is covered by black spruce picea mariana and sphagnum mosses the bog topography is characterized by a slightly domed peat surface rising 18 cm at its peak with a presumed parallel peatland water table richardson et al 2010 there is a streamflow outlet elevation of 420 m above sea level measurements of the peatland wte are taken near the highest elevation of the bog using a stripchart recorder and daily maximum water table is recorded sebestyen et al 2011 streamstage is measured using a v notch weir and strip chart recorder at the south west end of the catchment verry et al 2018 for data and metadata winter snow and frost depth were measured biweekly from 1962 to 2021 starting in february and continuing through snow disappearance sebestyen et al 2021a for data and metadata in s2 snow and frost measurements were taken biweekly on two upland snow courses in aspen stands and one bog snow course in a black spruce stand 2 1 2 north unit s5 bog s5 is a larger peatland on the north unit of the marcell experimental forest that is 52 6 ha in size and contains five small satellite peatlands that drain into a central peatland that is 6 1 ha the s5 uplands are have some older growth and more diverse with species of aspen white cedar thuja occidentalis white spruce picea glauca balsam fir abies balsamea pine pinus strobus pinus resinosa pinus banksiana and mixed hardwoods with an average stand age of 100 years bog water table elevations are measured in a similar way as in s2 using stripchart recorders to monitor a central peatland well streamstage is measured using a v notch weir at the northeast corner of the watershed similar to the s2 watershed snow depth swe and frost depth measurements are taken biweekly in s5 beginning in february and continue through snow disappearance there are four snow courses in s5 one in an upland clearing with the s5 meteorological station one in the bog and two in the uplands sebestyen et al 2011 2021b 2 1 3 forestry sciences laboratory grand rapids mn to increase the temporal resolution and coverage of the snow course data from the mef we used supplemental data with a longer record from the usda forest service grand rapids forestry sciences laboratory lat 47 14 9 2 n long 93 31 41 9 w approximately 48 km south of the mef here precipitation snow inputs and snow depth are all taken daily from 1915 precipitation and 1948 snow inputs depth onwards a correlation between precipitation inputs at the two sites is shown in fig s1 in grand rapids the mean annual temperature from 1950 to 2020 was 4 5 c and precipitation was 71 cm snow depth data from 1974 1989 were missing most of the daily values and so these years were removed from the analysis 2 2 characterizing the timing and magnitude of hydrological events we first identified hydrological events in the winter and spring periods and derived metrics characterizing two key aspects of these events magnitude and timing in the water year defined here as october 1st to september 30th these standardized metrics can be used to compare hydrological events across multiple years 1995 2020 and detect trends over time we focused on the winter to spring seasonal transition because this transition is a period of high flow that often contributes the most to the annual streamflow yield the metrics for the snowpack dataset were calculated based on the triangle method used by trujillo and molotch 2014 for swe data the method which was developed to identify key snow appearance disappearance and peak values for snowpacks in the western united states has not been applied to snow depth data in minnesota before however annual snow depth time series from grand rapids demonstrate a similar triangle structure so we anticipated that the method will be effective for our needs here we applied the triangle method to the grand rapids snow depth data to derive snowpack metrics for both the s2 and s5 catchments the mef snowpack data were not used for these metrics because the biweekly data did not have high enough temporal resolution implementing this method involved identifying three key dates in the snow season the date of snow appearance doa the date of peak snow depth dop and the date of snow disappearance dod the doa and dod values for each water year were determined to be the first and last non zero value of snow depth with a seven day buffer to control any erratic early or late season snow events to determine the dop that best approximates the transition between snow accumulation and ablation it was necessary to identify first all potential peaks and then investigate the fit to a triangular function for snow depth evolution to do so the find peaks function from the scipy signal package in python 3 8 virtanen et al 2020 was used to first identify all potential peak values between the timing of the 10th and 90th percentile of snow accumulation to ensure the detected snowpack peak occurred near the middle of the snow season which had snow depths above half the annual mean then each of the potential peaks was used to simulate snow depth using a triangular function where snow depth increases linearly from doa to the date of potential peak then decreases linearly until it reaches zero at dod each of these fits with its corresponding dop was then compared to the measured snow depth data using a nonparametric mann kendall test for monotonic trends the dop whose corresponding fit resulted in the highest correlation coefficient against measured snow depth was selected for that year the snow depth at dop was also identified as well as the duration and rates of the accumulation and melt periods for the wte metrics we observed that the spring recharge period begins with a typically annual low value right before the spring climb to a seasonal high fig 1 for measuring the magnitude of the spring climb the overall duration of the recharge period and total wte recharge of the season were also identified the find peaks function was again used to select possible dates for the seasonal wte trough and peak during the spring recharge period for each of the several possible trough peak pairs identified the mann kendall test was again used to compare a linear function of wte recharge generated against the measured data the pair with the highest correlation was selected for the timing metrics and their wte values were recorded the spring streamflow timing metrics were selected as the maximum value of the first major peak of the spring season and the timing of first nonzero value as the onset of spring streamflow the magnitude of the first spring streamflow peak was also recorded due to the limited resolution i e biweekly frost data from the mef sites we only identified the maximum frost depth value and date of maximum 2 3 rank and correlational analysis each timing metric across the data record was examined for annual trends using linear regression across each water year october 1st september 30th this analysis included examining six timing metrics to quantify spring seasonal hydrology the peak snow depth s p e a k the date of snow disappearance s d o d the date of wte trough w t r o u g h the date of wte peak w p e a k the date of streamflow onset q o n s e t and the date of the first streamflow peak q p e a k a correlation analysis was used to examine the relationships between the timings of each of the same six variables of interest for each year the day of the water year in which these events occurred was recorded in a list and used to rank each of the variables e g if the maximum wte occurred first among the six events in water year 2012 then it was given rank 1 the ranks for each event were then averaged across all years 2 4 multivariate regression we used multiple regression to examine the interactions among hydrological and climatological variables in controlling streamflow generation in the spring and throughout the year a stepwise multiple regression model was built to predict the magnitude of total annual streamflow from a set of site dependent and shared precipitation variables a total of six predictor variables were used air temperature x a v g t e m p snowpack depth x s n o w p e a k max annual frost thickness x m f t average annual wte x w t e total annual precipitation x t o t p r e c i p and an indicator to designate either the s2 or s5 watershed i w a t e r s h e d table 1 all data used in this model is site specific a random sampling of 60 of the years 1995 2020 were used for the stepwise analysis this subset was then used to build sub multiple regression models using different combinations of the predictor variables using a stepwise analysis each model tested was a subset of the full model which contains all the predictor variables and all potential combinations of interaction terms here p is the power set or all combinations of the interaction term 1 y f l o w β 0 p β i j k l x i s n o w p e a k x j m f t x k w t e i l w a t e r s h e d β 2 x a v g t e m p β 3 x t o t p r e c i p a total of 668 sub models were constructed from the full model shown in eq 1 for each model a second order bias corrected akaike s information criterion aicc was used to compare predictive capacity and the models with lower aicc δ aicc 2 were taken as candidate models burnham et al 2011 δ aicc is the difference between the aicc value of the best fit model and the model of interest a model with a similar goodness of fit to the best fit model will have a minimized δ aicc each candidate model was then used to predict the remaining 40 of the data set and validated for linearity constant variance and normality in addition each model was given a weight w i which is the probability of the model given the data burnham et al 2011 w i is computed as the likelihood of a given model over the total number of models and can be read as the probability of model i is w i for each predictor variable these weights were summed across the sub models containing that particular predictor variable to obtain the overall relative importance of each variable this process was then repeated 1000 times with a different random sampling of years for each candidate model to determine an expected range of rmse this processes was repeated to predict the magnitude of the first spring streamflow peak q p e a k which is outlined in the supplementary materials to further evaluate the results from the variable importance analysis a separate dominance analysis was run to determine the independent effects of each predictor variable within the best fit model budescu 1993 murray and conner 2009 this method allowed us to consider the amount of variation in the annual streamflow data that is explained by each individual predictor variable while removing any covariance between predictors it is a metric of the relative explanatory power of each variable within a single model this dominance analysis is different then the step wise regression model analysis which determines variable importance between models the dominance analysis was run using all of the data not only the 60 random sampling 3 results total annual streamflow normalized by respective catchment areas decreased in s2 at a rate of 1 9 cm per water year over 25 years p 0 005 1995 2020 and in s5 at a rate of 2 9 cm per water year also over 25 years p 0 05 fig 2a the decrease in annual streamflow occurred despite no statistically significant changes in snowfall fraction p 0 69 fig 2b annual precipitation p 0 331 snowfall inputs p 0 829 or winter air temperature p 0 47 fig 2c there was an increase in mean annual air temperature of 0 4 c per decade p 0 0005 sebestyen et al 2011 but annual streamflow across multiple years shows no statistically significant correlation with mean annual air temperature p 0 775 average annual wte in the s2 peatland decreased at a rate of 4 cm decade p 0 002 with the trough wte decreasing at a slightly faster rate of 6 5 cm decade p 0 066 3 1 streamflow generation results from the signal processing of hydrological data showed a consistent sequence of events as water traveled from the snowpack through the landscape to generate streamflow fig 3 shows the relationship between the streamflow and wte in s2 and s5 first there is a clear wte threshold that dictates the initiation of streamflow in both s2 and s5 fig 3a b which demonstrates the surface water storage must first be filled before it spills into the stream there is also a direct and statistically significant relationship between the timing of peak wte and the first streamflow peak in both catchments across years fig 3c d fig 4 shows the ranked estimates for the timing of each hydrological event for 2013 top panel and for all years of record bottom panel when averaged across years and catchments dates of s p e a k w t r o u g h q o n s e t s d o d w p e a k and q p e a k occurred sequentially with mean dates of 135 156 166 170 187 and 190 respectively dates for wte trough w t r o u g h and peak w p e a k were similar in s2 and s5 with s5 showing more variation in trough dates and less variation in peak dates than s2 streamflow onset q o n s e t in s5 typically occurred later than in s2 and with much higher temporal variation mean 164 7 and 168 sd of 14 8 and 21 7 respectively date of first streamflow peak q p e a k was similar for both catchments 190 4 and 190 1 respectively while there is a clear sequence of events during spring the timing for most of the individual events is not correlated with the exception of q p e a k and w t r o u g h as shown in fig 3 for instance the timing of peak snow the timing of the wte trough and the timing of streamflow onset are not correlated fig s4 3 2 relative impacts of landscape controls on streamflow the stepwise regression model eq 1 was used to determine the relative explanatory power of each hydrological and climatological input variable on annual streamflow select model candidates smallest values of δ aicc for predicting the total annual flow are shown in table 2 the base model was ranked last of the 668 models with the highest δ aicc also listed are k the degrees of freedom in the selected model and w i or the probability of the model given the data of the metrics shown in table 2 the value of w i or weight is the most important as it shows the probability that of all of the models considered that model is the best model for making predictions each model in table 2 shows zero mean and standardized residuals but all of the candidate models also show a slight increasing trend in the variance as a function of the residuals which may violate the constant variance assumption the direction of the increase is not consistent using cook s distance 1 distance 0 5 discharge in model 3 for year 2013 and s2 was identified as an outlier cook 2000 all other models show no outliers the remaining validation years were then used to predict values of total annual flow and compare to the observed flows from the same year sample plots of these values are shown in fig 5 frost was an important predictor in the summed weights for each of the predictor variables fig 5 the individual variables top four rows showed the highest importance with maximum frost thickness being the most highly weighted variable with a weight of 0 98 out of a possible normalized score of 1 meaning that frost had the most additive predictive power when present in a model mean frost thickness in s2 was 5 7 cm with a range of 0 to 36 cm 1995 2020 in s5 mean frost thickness is 10 5 cm with a range of 0 to 42 cm the date of maximum frost at s5 occurred later in the season when compared to s2 and when ranked with other spring variables occurred last total annual precipitation was ranked as the second most important predictor variable however when the dominance analysis is used on the top model y f l o w 1 only 12 3 of the total variance explained by the model is explained by the maximum frost thickness 49 4 of the total variance is explained by the water table elevation 26 by precipitation and 12 3 by the frost thickness and water table interaction term when regression was also applied to predict the magnitude at q p e a k shown in tables s1 and s2 of the supplementary materials snow depth was the most highly weighted variable 0 971 followed closely by maximum frost depth 0 923 within the top weighted model however it was the snow depth and catchment interaction term that was describing the majority of the variance 42 9 followed by catchment 34 8 maximum frost thickness 17 5 and then snow depth 4 8 as a result while frost may have a large weight when each model is considered as a whole during the step wise regression analysis frost is not always the most important variable within each model see fig 6 additionally of the models tested with only a single predictor the model with wte had the most predictive power with a δ aicc of 14 25 followed successively by the models with the catchment indicator δ aicc 15 25 average annual temperature δ aicc 25 11 total annual precipitation δ aicc 26 03 maximum frost thickness δ aicc 29 58 and finally peak snow depth δ aicc 31 38 catchment indicator is high in these rankings because of the high correlation between catchment and average wte this result and the results from the dominance analysis suggest that frost is not the singular best indicator of streamflow but is an important predictor in the context of other better streamflow predictors like precipitation and wte from the candidate models it is important to note the interchangeability of wte and catchment because the average wte in s2 is lower than s5 421 m vs 423 m wte acts as a pseudo indicator variable for catchment but there is a slight dominance of wte over catchment for example the top two models in table 2 are the same components other than the presence of either x w t e variables in y f l o w 1 or i w a t e r s h e d in y f l o w 2 additionally x w t e has a slightly higher weight than i w a t e r s h e d fig 5 4 discussion we examined the interactions among climatological and hydrological drivers of streamflow in snow dominated catchments using long term data from two headwater catchments at the marcell experimental forest in northern minnesota s2 and s5 our analysis showed that the annual streamflow decreased between 1995 and 2017 with s5 decreasing at a faster rate than s2 in fact s5 has shown little to no streamflow out of the peatland in the last 4 years of the record these declining streamflow trends showed a small significant correlation p 0 044 with maximum annual snowpack fig s3 but no significant correlation with various other climatic variables such as snowfall fraction fig 2b and winter air temperature fig 2c this lack of correlation suggests that the observed changes in streamflow must be considered in conjunction with other land surface drivers one possible driver may be an increase in evapotranspiration caused by increases in surface energy and air temperature badger et al 2021 however there is no correlation between air temperature and streamflow p 0 5 which means that while increasing evapotranspiration is still a possible cause it likely is not the whole explanation we could not perform direct analysis with respect to et since direct measurements of et are not available instead we hypothesize that the decrease in streamflow is a result of the shifts in both hydrological connectivity within the wetlands and how this connectivity regulates the streamflow generation processes by exploring the role of other climatological and hydrological drivers within the peatland catchments our results illustrate the complex relationships between snow water table elevations and streamflow as well as the important role of soil frost in controlling these relations 4 1 hydrologic connectivity our results show that within peatland catchments there is a clear connection between wte and streamflow where the shift in peak wte towards later in the spring induces a parallel shift in the first streamflow peak fig 3 this coupling between wte and streamflow highlights the importance of hydrological connectivity within this system due to the elevated wte in the spring compared to the rest of the year fig 1 this coupling also identifies the spring season as the most important part of the year for dictating annual streamflow magnitude this hydrologic connectivity is also supported by the ranking analysis from fig 4 which gives the sequence of events that lead to streamflow generation from the snowpack fig 4 the first event in the ordering is the timing of the peak snowpack indicating the beginning of the snow melt season the second event is the timing of the lowest point in the wte the trough which precedes recharge there is a delay between these first two events potentially due to peatland storage the refreezing of water into the snowpack as it melts heldmyer et al 2021 ripening of the snowpack or sublimation of snow back to the atmosphere once the water has begun reaching the peatland water table the ranking scheme indicates that the water table then acts as a secondary storage system until streamflow initiates streamflow onset is then initiated only after the wte rises above a threshold relative to the outlet stream elevation fig 3a b the date of frost disappearance was excluded from this ranking because of the low data resolution for frost depth so the timing of soil frost in relation to water table recharge and streamflow onset is unknown past studies that have found no dependence between frost and streamflow timing have shown this is likely due to the frost thawing before recharge begins lindström et al 2002 while other sites that have shown dependence between streamflow and soil frost have identified rapid streamflow response when precipitation is falling on frozen snow free ground shanley and chalmers 1999 for our results to be put into context of these previous studies higher frequency soil frost monitoring is needed 4 2 explanatory power of soil frost although the role of soil frost disappearance timing remains uncertain the stepwise multiple regression model built to predict streamflow from both climatological and hydrological variables demonstrated a strong dependence on soil frost thickness the five best performing models for streamflow each contains a combination of frost thickness water table elevation catchment air temperature and total annual precipitation peak snowpack depth at the mef is not selected as an important predictive variable in these top models which was unexpected given that past studies commonly use swe to predict streamflow bayard et al 2005 ryberg et al 2016 however in our case snow depth may not capture the same temporal variability in snow density as swe limiting the ability to predict spring streamflow from snow depth maximum frost thickness is the most highly weighted predictor variable when compared to all other possible predictors with weight defined in section 2 4 this result runs counter to the expectation that precipitation or snowpack the more commonly used predictors for streamflow would have the most weight total annual precipitation was the second highest weighted predictor followed by both wte and catchment however it is important to note two things first when each of the predictor variables are used to predict streamflow on their own maximum frost thickness has the second lowest explanatory power second within the best model for streamflow frost was only describing 12 of the total model variance similar to snowpack soil frost is not present every year and therefore should not be directly relied upon to solely predict streamflow instead in areas where frost may appear it should be considered as an important driver of streamflow generation and a supporting predictor for streamflow amount this result is not unexpected given the wealth of data showing the influence of soil frost on infiltration in both modeled soil columns zhao and gray 1999 and catchments on short time scales 3 years shanley and chalmers 1999 nevertheless it reinforces the idea that frost is an important hydrologic factor even across long time scales additionally while many of these analyses have looked at the effects of soil frost on infiltration or streamflow ala aho et al 2021 bayard et al 2005 lindström et al 2002 our results show how these effects extend to streamflow lateral dynamics and connective fluxes across the catchment specifically in areas where the season of frozen ground overlaps with the spring recharge season as does in much of northern north america soil frost is sometimes a dominant factor affecting both the timing and magnitude of recharge and streamflow in forested catchments while it is unclear why soil frost seems to be particularly influential in our studied catchments compared to forested catchments aho et al 2021 one reason may be that the perched water table may make peatlands more susceptible to higher frost contents in the upper ground layers higher frost content in the upper layers would cause more drastic restrictions in infiltration and a larger fraction of snowmelt being routed to streamflow 4 3 applications to water balance partitioning the presence of increased soil frost depth is generally known to either limit the infiltration of water to the water table making the recharge and baseflow processes slower and delaying streamflow initiation or limit recharge altogether and cause rapid streamflow generation through overland flow ala aho et al 2021 fuss et al 2016 shanley and chalmers 1999 these processes dictate the division of water between that which is available to plants for transpiration and that which flows to streams while the effects of different plant cover types soil types and snow cover distributions on water partitioning have been studied hammond et al 2019 the coupled effects of soil frost on partitioning are still understudied in this section we present several hypotheses and preliminary results to illustrate how frost could control snowmelt partitioning in the mef catchments the decoupled timing between snowpack melt and streamflow initiation implies that there may be an influence of frost on this partitioning in both s2 and s5 fig 7 shows a depiction of how different snowfall and winter temperature scenarios may dictate i the depth of the frost layer and ii the partitioning of swe for spring streamflow and evapotranspiration in each proposed scenario data from the s2 and s5 catchments 1995 2020 have been divided into each of four winter temperature and snowfall scenarios years with winter temperatures above the average are considered warmer winter and years with snowfall totals above the average are considered more snowfall and vice versa scenario a shows the baseline conditions at the mef where there is more snowfall and colder winter temperatures compared to future projected conditions in this scenario a large snowpack and colder temperatures result in a lower maximum frost thickness compared to a deeper frost depth in scenario b see light blue boxplots in upper row where there is little snow and less insulation or the thin frost layer in c where there are warmer temperatures because of the deeper snowpacks scenarios a and c will have more water available than in scenarios b and d respectively fig 7 dark blue areas in the arrows snow water equivalent represents the amount of water that is available to recharge soil storage or runoff to spring streamflow thus less swe can result in a reduction in overall streamflow water availability barnett et al 2005 fig 7a to b or c to d purple arrows and boxplots additionally the depth of soil frost may control the partitioning of swe over two steps first by controlling the amount of soil water availability in early spring and then the amount of soil water taken up by evapotranspiration in the late spring in the first stage the presence of frost limits early snowmelt infiltration and enhances surface runoff to streamflow but we hypothesize that a reduction in vertical drainage may also increase saturation in the top part of the peat soil column in the second stage transpiration is assumed to start only after the ground has thawed and after leaf out mellander et al 2006 here because the melting of the frost layer depends on the insulation effects of snow snow also plays a role in determining the timing of transpiration onset therefore the magnitude of spring evapotranspiration will depend both on the timing of soil frost disappearance and the amount of soil frost for example in scenario a there is a large amount of water available in the snowpack and because of the deep frost layer coupled with the deep snowpack more of the water is lost to overland flow due to inhibited infiltration and delayed transpiration onset therefore q in a q in c and et in a et in c despite the same snowfall inputs however comparing scenario b to a there is a thicker frost layer as confirmed by the mef data but a larger fraction of the available water is directed towards evapotranspiration because the frost layer melts out more quickly due to the small snowpack leaving more time for transpiration in the spring this is reflected in the data from s2 and s5 which respectively show a lower amount of annual streamflow in scenario b compared to scenario a there is also a lot more variation in the data during the years with less snowfall likely due a patchy snow cover this redistribution of soil water storage towards earlier spring evapotranspiration with deep frost and little snowfall could lead to overall increases in the evaporative fraction of meltwater inputs we can see that if winter temperatures increase and snowfall rates stay constant a c there may actually be overall increase in evapotranspiration at the expense of streamflow if winter temperatures remain constant but snowfall decreases a b the rates of evapotranspiration may remain relatively constant despite the decrease in water availability because of the shift in partitioning due to frost if there are simultaneous increases in temperature and decreases in snowfall a d the partition remains relatively the same accordingly we could observe decreases in both evapotranspiration rates and overland runoff therefore it is important to consider the interactions of snow frost and water table dynamics when determining swe partitioning in headwater catchments like the mef 5 conclusions our results demonstrated the hydrologic connectivity between the snowpack water table frost and streamflow during the winter spring transition and highlights the importance of frost in streamflow generation in peatlands this research shows that in the context of catchment management it is important to monitor the snow pack and the frost layer together the interactions between snow and frost give a more holistic understanding of streamflow generation these interactions need to be properly accounted for in hydrological and land surface models so that we can improve our abilities to predict long term catchment response to environmental change and improve water management 6 open research all data used in this paper is accessible online at the following locations mef precipitation sebestyen s d d t

2541,the relationship between snowmelt and spring streamflow is changing under warming temperatures and diminishing snowpack at the same time the hydrologic connectivity across catchment landscape elements such as snowpack and surface wetlands can play a critical role in controlling the routing of snowmelt to streams the role of hydrologic connectivity is important in headwater regions of the continental northern latitudes where catchments have low topographic relief and seasonally frozen ground nevertheless the effects of soil frost on the sequence timing and magnitudes of hydrologic events that drive the movement of water from a snowpack to a stream are not fully understood therefore we examine two questions first what is the flowpath that snow melt and precipitation from spring rain events takes to generate spring streamflow and second what hydrologic climatic or landscape variables exert the most control on the magnitude of streamflow here we use long term hydrological records from the two reference basins at the marcell experimental forest in northern minnesota to analyze the cascading effects across precipitation snow water table elevation soil frost and streamflow in peatland dominated headwater catchments we identify a sequence of fill and spill effects across the landscape that control the timing of spring streamflow generation then we use stepwise regression to show that soil frost is a key supporting predictor for both the magnitude of streamflow in the spring as it adds significantly to the predictive power of precipitation and water table elevation our results highlight the importance of recognizing the role of soil frost when present on the partitioning of snowmelt between overland runoff and water table recharge during the critical snowmelt period as well as the later partitioning between evapotranspiration and subsurface flows keywords peatlands streamflow generation long term data snow data availability published data sources are made available at the end of the document 1 introduction in snow dominated seasonally frozen catchments spring streamflow timing and magnitude have been affected by a warming winter climate for instance estimates have shown that over the last century spring streamflow peaks have shifted earlier by 4 5 to 8 6 days in the northern hemisphere hodgkins and dudley 2006 and 8 7 to 14 3 days in the north central united states ryberg et al 2016 these shifts in streamflow responses partially result from decreases in snow pack size ford et al 2020 including shifts in precipitation from snow to rain decreasing snowfall fraction or the portion of precipitation falling in the form of snow within a single catchment has been shown to lead to earlier spring streamflow peaks barnett et al 2005 as well as decreases in mean annual streamflow berghuijs et al 2014 foster et al 2016 however the influence of snow fraction on streamflow can be complicated by the direct effects of warming air temperature on the rate of snowmelt faster snowmelt rates which can occur when spring warming arrives earlier have been shown to lead to larger spring streamflow peaks and increased runoff and flood risk trujillo and molotch 2014 at the same time warming temperatures can also increase surface energy and evapotranspiration later in the spring which can have a counteracting effect that decreases streamflow badger et al 2021 even so the relative importance of snow fraction versus temperature driven land surface evaporative loss on streamflow remains unclear with studies showing that either could serve as a dominant driver of streamflow in different future climate scenarios foster et al 2016 therefore the complex interactions among climate snow and hydrological processes as the spring progresses remains an open research question the climatic effects on streamflow are mediated by the hydrologic connectivity on the landscape which is controlled by a range of surface and subsurface storage components that accelerate or inhibit the flow pathways connecting water as precipitation inputs to streamflow pringle 2003 for instance snow water equivalent swe the total amount of water stored in a snowpack represents a temporary storage of precipitation in a frozen state on the land surface until it is released during the spring as snowmelt this storage behavior temporarily halts the flow of water until it becomes available in liquid form again musselman et al 2021 as such the timing of snow disappearance and the duration of snowmelt period exhibit strong influence on snowmelt runoff streamflow peaks and overall water availability in the spring the relationships between snowmelt and streamflow are commonly studied in sites monitored using the snotel network in the western united states leuthold et al 2021 heldmyer et al 2021 trujillo and molotch 2014 where due to the well defined surface topography and bedrock geology in mountainous regions the flow path from snowmelt to streamflow is fairly direct schneider and molotch 2016 surface wetlands represents another storage for precipitation surface wetlands may occur in areas of low topographic relief and water within wetlands is stored until the water table elevation wte increases over a threshold elevation causing overland flow or lateral flow out of the wetland the wte to streamflow relationship is often the focus in studies on geographically isolated wetlands which demonstrate clear connectivity among precipitation wte and surface runoff cohen et al 2016 golden et al 2016 verry et al 2011 in geographically isolated wetlands the wte is the most important predictor of landscape connectivity because it determines the level of isolation between the wetland and its surrounding surface water bodies winter and labaugh 2003 as the height of the water table rises above the wetland surface levels the excess water flows over the landscape to a surrounding stream demonstrating the fill and spill flow dynamics characteristic of hydrologic storage mechanisms cohen et al 2016 winter and labaugh 2003 mcdonnell et al 2021 leibowitz and vining 2003 despite the importance of snowpack and wetlands in determining the connectivity to and therefore timing and magnitude of streamflow these near surface storage components have rarely been studied together especially in conjunction with another important landscape driver soil frost in areas of seasonally frozen ground air temperature snow and soil moisture content control frost depths which influence the snowmelt partitioning between overland flow and subsurface recharge aygün et al 2019 verry et al 2011 frozen ground restricts the infiltration of snowmelt and water table recharge thereby increasing surface runoff zhao and gray 1999 kane and stein 1983 the combined effects of rising winter temperatures and shrinking snowpack will also reduce the frost layer resulting in an overall increase in the rate of groundwater recharge due to earlier snow melt and higher infiltration rates jyrkama and sykes 2007 the importance of frost is dependent on a diverse range of factors some of which are difficult to predict or remain uncertain while frost is more likely to affect streamflow in small catchments cold climates and forested land cover can limit the effects frost has on streamflow ala aho et al 2021 for example a soil frost model developed using data from a catchment in northern sweden showed no clear effect of soil frost on either the timing or magnitude of streamflow runoff this lack of connection between frost and streamflow was likely due to limited frost occurrence frost formed in only slightly more than half the years or because the frost often had thawed before spring melt and streamflow onset lindström et al 2002 in contrast at a site in southern switzerland only 25 35 of the melt water infiltrated into the soil in a winter with thin snowpack and thick frost layer compared to 90 100 in a different winter that had a deep snowpack and thin frost layer bayard et al 2005 as the effect of frost is variable across catchments and its presence can greatly affect spring runoff it is important to consider that first soil frost can be quite heterogeneous across the landscape a variability that is not captured in soil profile studies zhao and gray 1999 kane and stein 1983 second soil frost varies from year to year depending on winter climate and precipitation capturing these spatial and temporal variations is key to better understanding the relationship between soil frost and streamflow generation in this study we use long term climatological and hydrological data to show a clear cascade of hydrological connectivity throughout the landscape and to determine the relative strengths of climatic and land surface variable in predicting annual streamflow trends peatlands provide an ideal environment in which to study interacting surface and subsurface flows in the spring snowmelt season the majority of peatlands are located in northern latitudes where seasonal soil frost is becoming more dynamic under climate change as soils transition from permanently frozen to seasonally frozen soils bridgham et al 2013 additionally wetlands including peatlands are the single largest natural source of methane contributing about a third of total global emissions gorham 1991 with methane emissions from peatlands strongly controlled by seasonal water table dynamics and snowmelt dynamics feng et al 2020 therefore it is critical to understand how the increasingly dynamic frost conditions will impact wetland water table and by consequence the role that peatlands play in both global and regional methane budgets regionally headwater streams and wetlands provide innumerable ecosystem services including regulating streamflow responses and improving downstream water quality colvin et al 2019 alexander et al 2007 this critical hydrological landscape provides the ideal location to examine the effects of shifting spring hydrologic cascades on the wider network of low relief catchments we focus on relationships among climate hydrology and landscape elements by examining two questions related to hydrologic connectivity in snow dominated low relief peatland catchments how do snow frost and surface wetlands mediate the flow paths from precipitation to spring streamflow and what hydrologic climatic or landscape variables most control the magnitude of streamflow as the effect of frost is variable across catchments and its presence can greatly affect spring runoff it is important to consider that first soil frost can be quite heterogeneous across the landscape a variability that is not captured in soil profile studies zhao and gray 1999 kane and stein 1983 second soil frost varies from year to year depending on winter climate and precipitation in this study we will examine these questions in two peatland catchments at the marcell experimental forest mef in northern minnesota usa using statistical approaches applied to the analysis of long term datasets by focusing on two watersheds with long data records we contribute new findings to both unresolved complexities of the importance of soil frost in forested catchments and expand upon existing soil profile event scale and modeling soil frost studies we first parameterize the processes that occur in the spring season by extracting key hydrological events from the long term time series and analyze the timing across each of these events through ranking then we use stepwise regression to identify the importance of winter and spring season variables for predicting annual streamflow together answers to these questions will illustrate the importance of considering soil frost in headwater catchments 2 methodology 2 1 site description our catchments are located within the usda forest service marcell experimental forest mef lat 47 31 52 n long 93 28 07 w near grand rapids minnesota usa the mef sits on the climatic transition region between areas of seasonally frozen ground and northern boreal regions and has six peatland dominated catchments that have been under long term observation since 1961 sebestyen et al 2011 the s2 and s5 research catchments are reference basins with central peatlands surrounded by upland forests on mineral soils records for these sites include hydrologic meteorological and water chemistry data sebestyen et al 2021b minnesota climate is strongly continental with warm humid summers and cold dry winters from 1961 to 2019 mean annual temperature at the catchments was 3 5 c sebestyen et al 2021b average annual temperature has been increasing by 0 4 c per decade since 1961 with the majority of the warming occurring over the winter months 37 january to march 0 7 c per decade annual precipitation averages 79 cm with one third of precipitation falling in the form of snow sebestyen et al 2021b snow cover in the peatland starts in late october and november and usually lasts until march or april of the following year there has been no change over time in maximum snow water equivalent under coniferous and open areas but significant decline under deciduous covers sebestyen et al 2011 2 1 1 south unit s2 bog the s2 watershed has a total size of 9 7 ha which is made up of a 3 2 ha domed peatland encircled by upland forests the upland vegetation is dominated by aspen populus tremuloides populus grandidentata stands the peatland is covered by black spruce picea mariana and sphagnum mosses the bog topography is characterized by a slightly domed peat surface rising 18 cm at its peak with a presumed parallel peatland water table richardson et al 2010 there is a streamflow outlet elevation of 420 m above sea level measurements of the peatland wte are taken near the highest elevation of the bog using a stripchart recorder and daily maximum water table is recorded sebestyen et al 2011 streamstage is measured using a v notch weir and strip chart recorder at the south west end of the catchment verry et al 2018 for data and metadata winter snow and frost depth were measured biweekly from 1962 to 2021 starting in february and continuing through snow disappearance sebestyen et al 2021a for data and metadata in s2 snow and frost measurements were taken biweekly on two upland snow courses in aspen stands and one bog snow course in a black spruce stand 2 1 2 north unit s5 bog s5 is a larger peatland on the north unit of the marcell experimental forest that is 52 6 ha in size and contains five small satellite peatlands that drain into a central peatland that is 6 1 ha the s5 uplands are have some older growth and more diverse with species of aspen white cedar thuja occidentalis white spruce picea glauca balsam fir abies balsamea pine pinus strobus pinus resinosa pinus banksiana and mixed hardwoods with an average stand age of 100 years bog water table elevations are measured in a similar way as in s2 using stripchart recorders to monitor a central peatland well streamstage is measured using a v notch weir at the northeast corner of the watershed similar to the s2 watershed snow depth swe and frost depth measurements are taken biweekly in s5 beginning in february and continue through snow disappearance there are four snow courses in s5 one in an upland clearing with the s5 meteorological station one in the bog and two in the uplands sebestyen et al 2011 2021b 2 1 3 forestry sciences laboratory grand rapids mn to increase the temporal resolution and coverage of the snow course data from the mef we used supplemental data with a longer record from the usda forest service grand rapids forestry sciences laboratory lat 47 14 9 2 n long 93 31 41 9 w approximately 48 km south of the mef here precipitation snow inputs and snow depth are all taken daily from 1915 precipitation and 1948 snow inputs depth onwards a correlation between precipitation inputs at the two sites is shown in fig s1 in grand rapids the mean annual temperature from 1950 to 2020 was 4 5 c and precipitation was 71 cm snow depth data from 1974 1989 were missing most of the daily values and so these years were removed from the analysis 2 2 characterizing the timing and magnitude of hydrological events we first identified hydrological events in the winter and spring periods and derived metrics characterizing two key aspects of these events magnitude and timing in the water year defined here as october 1st to september 30th these standardized metrics can be used to compare hydrological events across multiple years 1995 2020 and detect trends over time we focused on the winter to spring seasonal transition because this transition is a period of high flow that often contributes the most to the annual streamflow yield the metrics for the snowpack dataset were calculated based on the triangle method used by trujillo and molotch 2014 for swe data the method which was developed to identify key snow appearance disappearance and peak values for snowpacks in the western united states has not been applied to snow depth data in minnesota before however annual snow depth time series from grand rapids demonstrate a similar triangle structure so we anticipated that the method will be effective for our needs here we applied the triangle method to the grand rapids snow depth data to derive snowpack metrics for both the s2 and s5 catchments the mef snowpack data were not used for these metrics because the biweekly data did not have high enough temporal resolution implementing this method involved identifying three key dates in the snow season the date of snow appearance doa the date of peak snow depth dop and the date of snow disappearance dod the doa and dod values for each water year were determined to be the first and last non zero value of snow depth with a seven day buffer to control any erratic early or late season snow events to determine the dop that best approximates the transition between snow accumulation and ablation it was necessary to identify first all potential peaks and then investigate the fit to a triangular function for snow depth evolution to do so the find peaks function from the scipy signal package in python 3 8 virtanen et al 2020 was used to first identify all potential peak values between the timing of the 10th and 90th percentile of snow accumulation to ensure the detected snowpack peak occurred near the middle of the snow season which had snow depths above half the annual mean then each of the potential peaks was used to simulate snow depth using a triangular function where snow depth increases linearly from doa to the date of potential peak then decreases linearly until it reaches zero at dod each of these fits with its corresponding dop was then compared to the measured snow depth data using a nonparametric mann kendall test for monotonic trends the dop whose corresponding fit resulted in the highest correlation coefficient against measured snow depth was selected for that year the snow depth at dop was also identified as well as the duration and rates of the accumulation and melt periods for the wte metrics we observed that the spring recharge period begins with a typically annual low value right before the spring climb to a seasonal high fig 1 for measuring the magnitude of the spring climb the overall duration of the recharge period and total wte recharge of the season were also identified the find peaks function was again used to select possible dates for the seasonal wte trough and peak during the spring recharge period for each of the several possible trough peak pairs identified the mann kendall test was again used to compare a linear function of wte recharge generated against the measured data the pair with the highest correlation was selected for the timing metrics and their wte values were recorded the spring streamflow timing metrics were selected as the maximum value of the first major peak of the spring season and the timing of first nonzero value as the onset of spring streamflow the magnitude of the first spring streamflow peak was also recorded due to the limited resolution i e biweekly frost data from the mef sites we only identified the maximum frost depth value and date of maximum 2 3 rank and correlational analysis each timing metric across the data record was examined for annual trends using linear regression across each water year october 1st september 30th this analysis included examining six timing metrics to quantify spring seasonal hydrology the peak snow depth s p e a k the date of snow disappearance s d o d the date of wte trough w t r o u g h the date of wte peak w p e a k the date of streamflow onset q o n s e t and the date of the first streamflow peak q p e a k a correlation analysis was used to examine the relationships between the timings of each of the same six variables of interest for each year the day of the water year in which these events occurred was recorded in a list and used to rank each of the variables e g if the maximum wte occurred first among the six events in water year 2012 then it was given rank 1 the ranks for each event were then averaged across all years 2 4 multivariate regression we used multiple regression to examine the interactions among hydrological and climatological variables in controlling streamflow generation in the spring and throughout the year a stepwise multiple regression model was built to predict the magnitude of total annual streamflow from a set of site dependent and shared precipitation variables a total of six predictor variables were used air temperature x a v g t e m p snowpack depth x s n o w p e a k max annual frost thickness x m f t average annual wte x w t e total annual precipitation x t o t p r e c i p and an indicator to designate either the s2 or s5 watershed i w a t e r s h e d table 1 all data used in this model is site specific a random sampling of 60 of the years 1995 2020 were used for the stepwise analysis this subset was then used to build sub multiple regression models using different combinations of the predictor variables using a stepwise analysis each model tested was a subset of the full model which contains all the predictor variables and all potential combinations of interaction terms here p is the power set or all combinations of the interaction term 1 y f l o w β 0 p β i j k l x i s n o w p e a k x j m f t x k w t e i l w a t e r s h e d β 2 x a v g t e m p β 3 x t o t p r e c i p a total of 668 sub models were constructed from the full model shown in eq 1 for each model a second order bias corrected akaike s information criterion aicc was used to compare predictive capacity and the models with lower aicc δ aicc 2 were taken as candidate models burnham et al 2011 δ aicc is the difference between the aicc value of the best fit model and the model of interest a model with a similar goodness of fit to the best fit model will have a minimized δ aicc each candidate model was then used to predict the remaining 40 of the data set and validated for linearity constant variance and normality in addition each model was given a weight w i which is the probability of the model given the data burnham et al 2011 w i is computed as the likelihood of a given model over the total number of models and can be read as the probability of model i is w i for each predictor variable these weights were summed across the sub models containing that particular predictor variable to obtain the overall relative importance of each variable this process was then repeated 1000 times with a different random sampling of years for each candidate model to determine an expected range of rmse this processes was repeated to predict the magnitude of the first spring streamflow peak q p e a k which is outlined in the supplementary materials to further evaluate the results from the variable importance analysis a separate dominance analysis was run to determine the independent effects of each predictor variable within the best fit model budescu 1993 murray and conner 2009 this method allowed us to consider the amount of variation in the annual streamflow data that is explained by each individual predictor variable while removing any covariance between predictors it is a metric of the relative explanatory power of each variable within a single model this dominance analysis is different then the step wise regression model analysis which determines variable importance between models the dominance analysis was run using all of the data not only the 60 random sampling 3 results total annual streamflow normalized by respective catchment areas decreased in s2 at a rate of 1 9 cm per water year over 25 years p 0 005 1995 2020 and in s5 at a rate of 2 9 cm per water year also over 25 years p 0 05 fig 2a the decrease in annual streamflow occurred despite no statistically significant changes in snowfall fraction p 0 69 fig 2b annual precipitation p 0 331 snowfall inputs p 0 829 or winter air temperature p 0 47 fig 2c there was an increase in mean annual air temperature of 0 4 c per decade p 0 0005 sebestyen et al 2011 but annual streamflow across multiple years shows no statistically significant correlation with mean annual air temperature p 0 775 average annual wte in the s2 peatland decreased at a rate of 4 cm decade p 0 002 with the trough wte decreasing at a slightly faster rate of 6 5 cm decade p 0 066 3 1 streamflow generation results from the signal processing of hydrological data showed a consistent sequence of events as water traveled from the snowpack through the landscape to generate streamflow fig 3 shows the relationship between the streamflow and wte in s2 and s5 first there is a clear wte threshold that dictates the initiation of streamflow in both s2 and s5 fig 3a b which demonstrates the surface water storage must first be filled before it spills into the stream there is also a direct and statistically significant relationship between the timing of peak wte and the first streamflow peak in both catchments across years fig 3c d fig 4 shows the ranked estimates for the timing of each hydrological event for 2013 top panel and for all years of record bottom panel when averaged across years and catchments dates of s p e a k w t r o u g h q o n s e t s d o d w p e a k and q p e a k occurred sequentially with mean dates of 135 156 166 170 187 and 190 respectively dates for wte trough w t r o u g h and peak w p e a k were similar in s2 and s5 with s5 showing more variation in trough dates and less variation in peak dates than s2 streamflow onset q o n s e t in s5 typically occurred later than in s2 and with much higher temporal variation mean 164 7 and 168 sd of 14 8 and 21 7 respectively date of first streamflow peak q p e a k was similar for both catchments 190 4 and 190 1 respectively while there is a clear sequence of events during spring the timing for most of the individual events is not correlated with the exception of q p e a k and w t r o u g h as shown in fig 3 for instance the timing of peak snow the timing of the wte trough and the timing of streamflow onset are not correlated fig s4 3 2 relative impacts of landscape controls on streamflow the stepwise regression model eq 1 was used to determine the relative explanatory power of each hydrological and climatological input variable on annual streamflow select model candidates smallest values of δ aicc for predicting the total annual flow are shown in table 2 the base model was ranked last of the 668 models with the highest δ aicc also listed are k the degrees of freedom in the selected model and w i or the probability of the model given the data of the metrics shown in table 2 the value of w i or weight is the most important as it shows the probability that of all of the models considered that model is the best model for making predictions each model in table 2 shows zero mean and standardized residuals but all of the candidate models also show a slight increasing trend in the variance as a function of the residuals which may violate the constant variance assumption the direction of the increase is not consistent using cook s distance 1 distance 0 5 discharge in model 3 for year 2013 and s2 was identified as an outlier cook 2000 all other models show no outliers the remaining validation years were then used to predict values of total annual flow and compare to the observed flows from the same year sample plots of these values are shown in fig 5 frost was an important predictor in the summed weights for each of the predictor variables fig 5 the individual variables top four rows showed the highest importance with maximum frost thickness being the most highly weighted variable with a weight of 0 98 out of a possible normalized score of 1 meaning that frost had the most additive predictive power when present in a model mean frost thickness in s2 was 5 7 cm with a range of 0 to 36 cm 1995 2020 in s5 mean frost thickness is 10 5 cm with a range of 0 to 42 cm the date of maximum frost at s5 occurred later in the season when compared to s2 and when ranked with other spring variables occurred last total annual precipitation was ranked as the second most important predictor variable however when the dominance analysis is used on the top model y f l o w 1 only 12 3 of the total variance explained by the model is explained by the maximum frost thickness 49 4 of the total variance is explained by the water table elevation 26 by precipitation and 12 3 by the frost thickness and water table interaction term when regression was also applied to predict the magnitude at q p e a k shown in tables s1 and s2 of the supplementary materials snow depth was the most highly weighted variable 0 971 followed closely by maximum frost depth 0 923 within the top weighted model however it was the snow depth and catchment interaction term that was describing the majority of the variance 42 9 followed by catchment 34 8 maximum frost thickness 17 5 and then snow depth 4 8 as a result while frost may have a large weight when each model is considered as a whole during the step wise regression analysis frost is not always the most important variable within each model see fig 6 additionally of the models tested with only a single predictor the model with wte had the most predictive power with a δ aicc of 14 25 followed successively by the models with the catchment indicator δ aicc 15 25 average annual temperature δ aicc 25 11 total annual precipitation δ aicc 26 03 maximum frost thickness δ aicc 29 58 and finally peak snow depth δ aicc 31 38 catchment indicator is high in these rankings because of the high correlation between catchment and average wte this result and the results from the dominance analysis suggest that frost is not the singular best indicator of streamflow but is an important predictor in the context of other better streamflow predictors like precipitation and wte from the candidate models it is important to note the interchangeability of wte and catchment because the average wte in s2 is lower than s5 421 m vs 423 m wte acts as a pseudo indicator variable for catchment but there is a slight dominance of wte over catchment for example the top two models in table 2 are the same components other than the presence of either x w t e variables in y f l o w 1 or i w a t e r s h e d in y f l o w 2 additionally x w t e has a slightly higher weight than i w a t e r s h e d fig 5 4 discussion we examined the interactions among climatological and hydrological drivers of streamflow in snow dominated catchments using long term data from two headwater catchments at the marcell experimental forest in northern minnesota s2 and s5 our analysis showed that the annual streamflow decreased between 1995 and 2017 with s5 decreasing at a faster rate than s2 in fact s5 has shown little to no streamflow out of the peatland in the last 4 years of the record these declining streamflow trends showed a small significant correlation p 0 044 with maximum annual snowpack fig s3 but no significant correlation with various other climatic variables such as snowfall fraction fig 2b and winter air temperature fig 2c this lack of correlation suggests that the observed changes in streamflow must be considered in conjunction with other land surface drivers one possible driver may be an increase in evapotranspiration caused by increases in surface energy and air temperature badger et al 2021 however there is no correlation between air temperature and streamflow p 0 5 which means that while increasing evapotranspiration is still a possible cause it likely is not the whole explanation we could not perform direct analysis with respect to et since direct measurements of et are not available instead we hypothesize that the decrease in streamflow is a result of the shifts in both hydrological connectivity within the wetlands and how this connectivity regulates the streamflow generation processes by exploring the role of other climatological and hydrological drivers within the peatland catchments our results illustrate the complex relationships between snow water table elevations and streamflow as well as the important role of soil frost in controlling these relations 4 1 hydrologic connectivity our results show that within peatland catchments there is a clear connection between wte and streamflow where the shift in peak wte towards later in the spring induces a parallel shift in the first streamflow peak fig 3 this coupling between wte and streamflow highlights the importance of hydrological connectivity within this system due to the elevated wte in the spring compared to the rest of the year fig 1 this coupling also identifies the spring season as the most important part of the year for dictating annual streamflow magnitude this hydrologic connectivity is also supported by the ranking analysis from fig 4 which gives the sequence of events that lead to streamflow generation from the snowpack fig 4 the first event in the ordering is the timing of the peak snowpack indicating the beginning of the snow melt season the second event is the timing of the lowest point in the wte the trough which precedes recharge there is a delay between these first two events potentially due to peatland storage the refreezing of water into the snowpack as it melts heldmyer et al 2021 ripening of the snowpack or sublimation of snow back to the atmosphere once the water has begun reaching the peatland water table the ranking scheme indicates that the water table then acts as a secondary storage system until streamflow initiates streamflow onset is then initiated only after the wte rises above a threshold relative to the outlet stream elevation fig 3a b the date of frost disappearance was excluded from this ranking because of the low data resolution for frost depth so the timing of soil frost in relation to water table recharge and streamflow onset is unknown past studies that have found no dependence between frost and streamflow timing have shown this is likely due to the frost thawing before recharge begins lindström et al 2002 while other sites that have shown dependence between streamflow and soil frost have identified rapid streamflow response when precipitation is falling on frozen snow free ground shanley and chalmers 1999 for our results to be put into context of these previous studies higher frequency soil frost monitoring is needed 4 2 explanatory power of soil frost although the role of soil frost disappearance timing remains uncertain the stepwise multiple regression model built to predict streamflow from both climatological and hydrological variables demonstrated a strong dependence on soil frost thickness the five best performing models for streamflow each contains a combination of frost thickness water table elevation catchment air temperature and total annual precipitation peak snowpack depth at the mef is not selected as an important predictive variable in these top models which was unexpected given that past studies commonly use swe to predict streamflow bayard et al 2005 ryberg et al 2016 however in our case snow depth may not capture the same temporal variability in snow density as swe limiting the ability to predict spring streamflow from snow depth maximum frost thickness is the most highly weighted predictor variable when compared to all other possible predictors with weight defined in section 2 4 this result runs counter to the expectation that precipitation or snowpack the more commonly used predictors for streamflow would have the most weight total annual precipitation was the second highest weighted predictor followed by both wte and catchment however it is important to note two things first when each of the predictor variables are used to predict streamflow on their own maximum frost thickness has the second lowest explanatory power second within the best model for streamflow frost was only describing 12 of the total model variance similar to snowpack soil frost is not present every year and therefore should not be directly relied upon to solely predict streamflow instead in areas where frost may appear it should be considered as an important driver of streamflow generation and a supporting predictor for streamflow amount this result is not unexpected given the wealth of data showing the influence of soil frost on infiltration in both modeled soil columns zhao and gray 1999 and catchments on short time scales 3 years shanley and chalmers 1999 nevertheless it reinforces the idea that frost is an important hydrologic factor even across long time scales additionally while many of these analyses have looked at the effects of soil frost on infiltration or streamflow ala aho et al 2021 bayard et al 2005 lindström et al 2002 our results show how these effects extend to streamflow lateral dynamics and connective fluxes across the catchment specifically in areas where the season of frozen ground overlaps with the spring recharge season as does in much of northern north america soil frost is sometimes a dominant factor affecting both the timing and magnitude of recharge and streamflow in forested catchments while it is unclear why soil frost seems to be particularly influential in our studied catchments compared to forested catchments aho et al 2021 one reason may be that the perched water table may make peatlands more susceptible to higher frost contents in the upper ground layers higher frost content in the upper layers would cause more drastic restrictions in infiltration and a larger fraction of snowmelt being routed to streamflow 4 3 applications to water balance partitioning the presence of increased soil frost depth is generally known to either limit the infiltration of water to the water table making the recharge and baseflow processes slower and delaying streamflow initiation or limit recharge altogether and cause rapid streamflow generation through overland flow ala aho et al 2021 fuss et al 2016 shanley and chalmers 1999 these processes dictate the division of water between that which is available to plants for transpiration and that which flows to streams while the effects of different plant cover types soil types and snow cover distributions on water partitioning have been studied hammond et al 2019 the coupled effects of soil frost on partitioning are still understudied in this section we present several hypotheses and preliminary results to illustrate how frost could control snowmelt partitioning in the mef catchments the decoupled timing between snowpack melt and streamflow initiation implies that there may be an influence of frost on this partitioning in both s2 and s5 fig 7 shows a depiction of how different snowfall and winter temperature scenarios may dictate i the depth of the frost layer and ii the partitioning of swe for spring streamflow and evapotranspiration in each proposed scenario data from the s2 and s5 catchments 1995 2020 have been divided into each of four winter temperature and snowfall scenarios years with winter temperatures above the average are considered warmer winter and years with snowfall totals above the average are considered more snowfall and vice versa scenario a shows the baseline conditions at the mef where there is more snowfall and colder winter temperatures compared to future projected conditions in this scenario a large snowpack and colder temperatures result in a lower maximum frost thickness compared to a deeper frost depth in scenario b see light blue boxplots in upper row where there is little snow and less insulation or the thin frost layer in c where there are warmer temperatures because of the deeper snowpacks scenarios a and c will have more water available than in scenarios b and d respectively fig 7 dark blue areas in the arrows snow water equivalent represents the amount of water that is available to recharge soil storage or runoff to spring streamflow thus less swe can result in a reduction in overall streamflow water availability barnett et al 2005 fig 7a to b or c to d purple arrows and boxplots additionally the depth of soil frost may control the partitioning of swe over two steps first by controlling the amount of soil water availability in early spring and then the amount of soil water taken up by evapotranspiration in the late spring in the first stage the presence of frost limits early snowmelt infiltration and enhances surface runoff to streamflow but we hypothesize that a reduction in vertical drainage may also increase saturation in the top part of the peat soil column in the second stage transpiration is assumed to start only after the ground has thawed and after leaf out mellander et al 2006 here because the melting of the frost layer depends on the insulation effects of snow snow also plays a role in determining the timing of transpiration onset therefore the magnitude of spring evapotranspiration will depend both on the timing of soil frost disappearance and the amount of soil frost for example in scenario a there is a large amount of water available in the snowpack and because of the deep frost layer coupled with the deep snowpack more of the water is lost to overland flow due to inhibited infiltration and delayed transpiration onset therefore q in a q in c and et in a et in c despite the same snowfall inputs however comparing scenario b to a there is a thicker frost layer as confirmed by the mef data but a larger fraction of the available water is directed towards evapotranspiration because the frost layer melts out more quickly due to the small snowpack leaving more time for transpiration in the spring this is reflected in the data from s2 and s5 which respectively show a lower amount of annual streamflow in scenario b compared to scenario a there is also a lot more variation in the data during the years with less snowfall likely due a patchy snow cover this redistribution of soil water storage towards earlier spring evapotranspiration with deep frost and little snowfall could lead to overall increases in the evaporative fraction of meltwater inputs we can see that if winter temperatures increase and snowfall rates stay constant a c there may actually be overall increase in evapotranspiration at the expense of streamflow if winter temperatures remain constant but snowfall decreases a b the rates of evapotranspiration may remain relatively constant despite the decrease in water availability because of the shift in partitioning due to frost if there are simultaneous increases in temperature and decreases in snowfall a d the partition remains relatively the same accordingly we could observe decreases in both evapotranspiration rates and overland runoff therefore it is important to consider the interactions of snow frost and water table dynamics when determining swe partitioning in headwater catchments like the mef 5 conclusions our results demonstrated the hydrologic connectivity between the snowpack water table frost and streamflow during the winter spring transition and highlights the importance of frost in streamflow generation in peatlands this research shows that in the context of catchment management it is important to monitor the snow pack and the frost layer together the interactions between snow and frost give a more holistic understanding of streamflow generation these interactions need to be properly accounted for in hydrological and land surface models so that we can improve our abilities to predict long term catchment response to environmental change and improve water management 6 open research all data used in this paper is accessible online at the following locations mef precipitation sebestyen s d d t

2542,soil erosion sediment yield and sediment transport associated with flash flooding in arid regions result in reservoir storage losses decreased infiltration high evaporation rates and degradation of downstream channels however the lack of observational data from wadi systems and an empirical formula to compute sediment yield has hindered reservoir trapping evaluation maintenance and management therefore this research aimed to estimate the annual soil loss in the upstream catchment area of a reservoir based on the revised universal soil loss equation rusle with a remote sensing dataset the sediment trapped in the assarin dam reservoir in oman was estimated by coupling unmanned aerial vehicle uav surveys with photogrammetry analysis to assess the reservoir siltation among the previous sediment trapping events seven sets of field observation data were collected to investigate the relationship between soil loss at the catchment scale and sediment deposition volumes in the reservoir the rusle method was applied to estimate soil erosion using independent factors such as rainfall erosivity soil erodibility topography cover management and conservation practices a remote sensing dataset and geographic information system gis environments were used to analyse the quantitative and spatial distribution of the rusle parameters two drone surveys were conducted over the reservoir before and after a flash flood the trapped sediment volume was estimated to be approximately 9 075 m3 11 343 ton per event representing approximately 1 26 of the total reservoir capacity this computed volume was validated using measurements from monitored sediment scale bars sited throughout the assarin dam reservoir yielding an accuracy of 79 from the rusle results the annual soil erosion was estimated to be 196 599 ton ha yr 1 of which approximately 5 8 was trapped in the reservoir spatial temporal variability in the rainfall patterns and the corresponding runoff discharges led to high sediment delivery at the outlet of the basin after analysing available data from previous field surveys in oman a new formula for estimating the sediment yield in wadi assarin was developed the results of this research which represent the first of their type in the middle east and north africa mena region can support reservoir management practices and show that uav based photogrammetry is suitable for measuring trapped sediment volumes keywords reservoir sedimentation uav arid region wadi sediment delivery ratio data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction although flash floods are essential sources of groundwater recharge they are also highly destructive natural disasters in the middle east and north africa mena al mamari et al 2019 therefore retention dams have been constructed to intercept these surface flows and prevent them from draining into the sea or the desert abdel fattah et al 2016 the critical issue associated with such dams worldwide is reservoir sedimentation which is controlled by geological hydraulic and hydrological factors george et al 2017 in particular high intensity and long duration rainfall events in arid regions cause extreme weathering of the land surface malmon et al 2007 and dry environments commonly exhibit steep and bare surface landforms and landscapes thus increasing sediment production in these regions moreover flash floods in dry areas can be severe and can influence sediment dynamics and sediment transport elçi et al 2007 dam reservoirs and downstream channels suffer from several problems as a result of sedimentation such as storage capacity losses reservoir bed clogging and channel degradation furthermore dam conditions in arid regions differ from those in humid areas specifically the weathering processes resulting from high temperatures strong winds drought and rainfall erosivity directly impact reservoir sedimentation accordingly the soil bulk density increases with decreasing infiltration al ismaily et al 2013 therefore floodwater is stored in a reservoir for only a short period weeks before being released to groundwater recharge downstream of the dam without considering sediment transport prathapar and bawain 2014 in oman the original storage capacity of the al khoud reservoir amounting to 11 6 million cubic metres decreased by more than 30 due to sedimentation between 1985 and 2015 al saqri et al 2016 moreover the international commission on large dams icold 2009 reported that many mena countries will experience high reservoir sedimentation volumes by 2050 however observed sedimentation data are unavailable in most mena regions many of which lack sediment gauging stations consequently measuring the amount of sediment in a reservoir is an integral component of dam operation and water resource management accordingly this study aims to assess the performance of a potential sediment management technique in a wadi catchment however quantifying sediment yield is challenging and our scientific understanding of sediment yields in arid environments remains incomplete due to the lack of observed data and in depth research the direct and indirect techniques for measuring sedimentation in reservoirs differ from those in perennial and ephemeral streams the typical monitoring methods of sedimentation in river systems involve bathymetric measurements using instruments such as an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp and multibeam and single beam sonar miranda 2021 asthana and khare 2022 in ephemeral streams two main common monitoring techniques have been used in dry environments to estimate reservoir siltation first sediment scale bars have been utilized in dry reservoirs saber et al 2019 these scale bars are distributed throughout a reservoir and provide local point measurements which are then averaged and multiplied by the basin area of the reservoir to estimate the volume of trapped sediment second multiple topographic surveys using total station measurements have been conducted to measure the amount of sediment deposited in dam reservoirs before and after floods however while this technique provides data on suspended and bedload materials that are more reliable and quantifiable than those from sediment scale bar surveys adongo et al 2020 shiferaw and abebe 2021 this method requires more time and is limited to the survey area encompassing the measurement points several tools have been developed to predict soil erosion and sediment yields including sediment rating curves tebbi et al 2012 numerical models and regional sediment yield estimates renard and lane n d ghernaout and remini 2014 dutta 2016 bulti 2021 and the trap efficiency of reservoirs brune 1953 understanding soil loss at the catchment scale is vital for arranging and planning mitigation structures and managing sedimentation in existing reservoirs in an investigation into soil conservation three main variables for soil erosion were identified cook 1937 this study found that the potential of rainfall erosivity runoff and the index of soil protectivity by plant cover had a more significant impact on soil erosion wischmeier and smith 1978 developed an empirical soil loss equation the universal soil loss equation usle to estimate soil erosion using erosion variable factors under specific conditions however a limitation of the usle method is the prediction of the spatial distribution of soil erosion at the watershed scale the revised universal soil loss equation rusle developed for soil losses at the catchment scale is straightforward and applicable to integration with geographic information system gis environments renard 1997 kirurhika et al 2011 studied soil erosion in india and found that approximately 0 16 ton km yr 1 occurred furthermore 10 was deposited in reservoirs and 29 was transported to the sea soil erosion prediction in arid regions is challenging due to climatic and hydrological variations previous research has investigated soil loss in wadi systems and found high soil erosion levels of 40 ton km yr 1 using the rusle method elhag et al 2022 additionally several studies have integrated the rusle model with high resolution sensors to map and monitor soil erosion eniyew et al 2021 kulimushi et al 2021 the sediment yield in wadi channels at any location in the catchment results from soil erosion in gullies transport deposition and other erosion processes in the channels the susceptibility of soil to erosion can increase due to various factors such as soil characteristics ostovari et al 2022 slope processes guerra et al 2017 and drainage area wasson 1994 in addition to the rainfall pattern integrating rainfall runoff and sediment transport models has become a principal tool for water resource assessment however this method depends on the data availability and hydrological responses of each subbasin according to the rainfall variability sediment yields in the saudi arabian wadi system were reported in the first model which was derived using the general dimensional analysis method şen 2014 satellite remote sensing methods have been widely used to detect geomorphological changes in combination with field measurements although open source remotely sensed data typically have a coarse resolution yousefi et al 2021 in recent years the ground based lidar technique has been widely used with high accuracy to generate digital elevation models dems or scan 3d objects in combination with photogrammetry analysis however the lidar technique is costly and more effective for local scale investigations rogers et al 2020 the use of unmanned aerial systems uass with photogrammetry analysis can yield high spatial coverage good accessibility and high accuracy salach et al 2018 these concepts vary depending on the condition and scale of the research area developments in remote sensing have led to relatively inexpensive and rapidly deployable devices such as unmanned aerial vehicles uavs with which erosion and deposition processes can be mapped and quantified at increasingly fine spatial resolutions at present empirical algorithms are continuously being transferred from existing remote sensing technologies to uavs considering that monitoring and investigating the transport of sediment require accurate high resolution spatial data representing the earth s surface clapuyt et al 2016 uavs also called drones and photogrammetric processing techniques allow very high resolution river data to be acquired nearly effortlessly other geoscientific applications of photogrammetry techniques include the detection of fluvial changes in a river system tamminga et al 2015 and geomorphic observations of a landslide tsunetaka et al 2020 combining these techniques could provide an economical and rapid solution for monitoring reservoir sedimentation in arid regions therefore this research aimed to estimate soil loss upstream of a reservoir catchment using the rusle approach and its association with trapped sediment in the reservoir the volume of sediment trapped in a dam reservoir was quantified with acceptable and representative values by using multitemporal drone and field surveys combined with photogrammetric analysis with the total volume of sedimentation being estimated using the level of sediment measured with sediment scale bars the workflow of the multitemporal topographic surveys conducted herein required the acquisition of considerable data and the implementation of numerous postprocessing steps finally a sediment yield formula is proposed based on an analysis of the available data 2 study area the study area is the assarin dam located southeast of muscat 2571416 15 m n 660927 40 m e the capital of oman fig 1 the assarin dam was constructed in 2011 after an extreme tropical cyclone named gonu caused severe damage to the infrastructure and property in the region usually dams in wadi systems are built for multiple functions such as flood control groundwater recharge and water storage the assarin dam reservoir has a capacity of 0 72 million cubic metres and a catchment area of 81 km2 8 100 ha ministry of regional municipalities water 2012 the catchment is geologically underlain by numerous sedimentary rock formations and features a valley with steep slopes at elevations ranging from 1000 m to more than 1300 m above the mean sea level moraetis et al 2020 in oman sediments trapped in dam reservoirs are irregularly removed by excavation without measurement or monitoring systems within the upstream catchment of the dam reservoir no monitoring data were available therefore precipitation satellite data were used 3 materials and methodology the methodology combined different approaches from field measurements remote sensing analysis hydrological and rusle models to assess reservoir siltation and estimate the sediment yield from the catchment in the wadi basin fig 2 shows the proposed flowchart of the detailed methodological approaches suitable for the wadi basins in arid areas further details for each approach are described in the following subsections for instance in section 3 1 the rusle and five different factors namely rainfall erosivity r soil erodibility k slope length and steepness ls cover management c and practice management p are introduced to estimate the average annual soil erosion in the catchment additionally a field investigation and drone survey were performed to understand the reservoir siltation and quantify the sediment yield as described in sections 3 2 3 3 and 3 4 moreover the extreme events that caused flash floods and transported sediment deposited in the reservoir were computed finally the sediment delivery ratio is determined from the sediment measured from the field surveys and the gross erosion per unit area is calculated with the rusle 3 1 rusle the rusle method to predict soil erosion has been widely used for estimating annual soil loss at the watershed scale using independent factors based on the gasemt database approximately 507 studies and investigations have used the rusle method borrelli et al 2021 the rusle has been used in various dry environments such as jordan farhan and nawaiseh 2015 egypt elnashar et al 2021 algeria melalih and mazour 2021 and iraq and iran allafta and opp 2022 the rusle equation yields the soil erosion per unit area in unit time which is expressed as 1 a r k l s c p where r is the rainfall erosivity factor mj mm h 1 ha 1 yr 1 k is the soil erodibility factor ton ha h ha mj 1 mm 1 ls is the slope length and steepness factor dimensionless c is the cover management factor and p is the conservation practice dimensionless all of which are factors used for the estimation of the average annual soil loss a ton ha yr 1 the raster layers of rainfall erosivity and soil erodibility were calculated and extracted from the google earth engine gee wang and zhao 2020 islam 2022 3 1 1 data sources and processing 3 1 1 1 rainfall erosivity factor r due to the lack of observed hydrological data and the nonhomogeneous spatial distributions of ground stations in most of the wadi systems in arid environments a satellite precipitation dataset was used to determine the rainfall erosivity therefore the monthly precipitation dataset with a downscaled 1 0 km2 resolution from sm2rain ascat was applied to calculate the r factor over the catchment area in eq 2 wischmeier and smith 1978 2 r 1 73 10 1 5 l o g p m 2 p a 0 08188 where r is the rainfall erosivity in mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 pm is the monthly precipitation mm and pa is the yearly precipitation mm the accuracy of the satellite precipitation dataset was investigated and tested with regional observation data in iran which neighbours oman to the north and the results showed that sm2rain ascat had better accuracy than persian ccs and cmorph with root square mean errors rmses of 2 4 mm 4 36 mm and 28 83 mm respectively eini et al 2021 the annual average rainfall in the reservoir catchment was 104 mm in total seven significant flood events were recorded in wadi assarin from 2011 to 2019 ranging from 27 4 to 134 4 mm with rainfall intensities ranging from 2 6 to 6 7 mm hr at the nearest available gauge station to the catchment fig 10a these rainfall intensities over bare land in arid regions cause high erosivity due to the kinetic energy of raindrops additionally the shear stress induced by flash floods passing over dry channel beds increases sediment transport from the drainage network to the reservoir azab et al 2021 the available data from the surrounding catchments demonstrate that the reservoir in the wadi assarin is exposed to one extreme flash flood per year which was confirmed by pedon analysis 3 1 1 2 soil erodibility k the k factor represents the resistance of soil to erosion from the impacts of kinetic energy from raindrops this factor depends on the soil structure texture organic content and porosity the soilgrids250 m dataset was used to estimate the soil texture sand clay and silt content and organic carbon content to compute the k factor using eq 3 sharpley and williams 1990 hengl et al 2017 3 k 0 2 0 3 e x p 0 0256 s a n 1 s i l 100 1 0 25 c l a cla e x p 3 72 2 95 c l a where san sil and cla are the percentages of sand silt and clay respectively the k factor was calculated using eq 3 in gee 3 1 1 3 topography factor ls the ls factor represents the topographical effect on soil erosion based on slope length and steepness which can accelerate the effects of rainfall the ls factor includes the flow accumulation and slope degree determined from the dem with a 5 metre resolution national survey authority oman the ls was calculated using eq 4 moore et al 1991 4 ls 0 4 1 flowaccmulation c e l l s i z e 22 13 0 4 sin s l o p e 0 0896 1 3 where l and s describe slope length and steepness dimensionless flow accumulation represents the cumulative upslope of cells that contribute to flow for a particular cell cell size equals the size of the grid cell and sine slope equals the sin of the slope angle in degrees 3 1 1 4 cover management factor c the impacts of land cover and plant management upstream of the reservoir catchment are very limited the ndvi was obtained from landsat 8 satellite images using red and near infrared wavebands and the c factor was estimated with the following equation durigon et al 2014 5 c 0 1 n d v i 1 2 where ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index 3 1 1 4 1 management practice factor p overall no central conservation practice in the target study area affects the hydrodynamics of flash floods in previous research a p value of 1 was assumed for all watersheds in arid regions gaubi et al 2017 3 2 sediment yield runoff relationship in the wadi system developing empirical approaches and charts for specific conditions and regions is essential for obtaining and understanding these phenomena the lack of observational data is the major challenge in evaluating the sediment yield in arid regions kantoush et al 2022 conducted field surveys to estimate the trapped sediments in the assarin dam reservoir for different periods using the sediment scale bar and gis environments the discharge of the watershed was simulated by using the rainfall runoff inundation rri model without dams to calibrate and validate the model with the downstream gauging station their results which included drone measurements were compared with predicted sediment yield values from the sediment yield model developed by şen 2014 for another wadi system the empirical model in eq 6 was used only for comparative purposes the model identified and analysed the sediment yield in the wadi system using physical relations and the calculation of some correlated variables in the catchment with homogeneous dimensions the four most significant variables were selected to develop the following sediment yield equation 6 s y 0 0001 s q a where sy is the sediment yield s is the mean channel slope dimensionless q is the discharge m3 s and a is the catchment area km2 the sediment yield was estimated for several subcatchments upstream of the wadi jizan dam in southwestern saudi arabia 3 3 field survey and photogrammetry in this study field and drone surveys were conducted to estimate the volume of sediment trapped in a wadi system reservoir in an arid region the spillway and sluice gate of the assarin dam are located in the high stage which reduces the vulnerability of fine and coarse sediment transport from the reservoir to the downstream channel additionally the water was stored in the reservoir for more than two weeks before being released downstream to promote the groundwater recharge process the flash flood that occurred between field surveys in the wadi assarin filled the dam reservoir without a spillway therefore it can be assumed that the trapped sediment is equal to the sediment yield a total of 19 sediment scale bars pegs were installed throughout the reservoir based on the bed elevation to measure sediment deposition during the construction of the assarin dam fig 3 b the sediment scale bars were installed with two different post heights eleven bars located near the dam have a height of 1 5 m while the other 8 bars have a height of 1 m to investigate the siltation in the reservoir and determine the sediment volume two drone surveys were conducted in the dam reservoir one on 17 march 2019 yielding 223 images and one on 25 august 2019 yielding 430 images the readings from sediment scale bars reveal the variance in the distribution of sediment deposits across the reservoir due to previous flash floods which eroded the reservoir bed before the sediments were retained by the dam body fig 3 a shows the sediment bar readings obtained in two periods before and after a flood event and their corresponding locations throughout the dam reservoir a total of 15 ground control points gcps were sited around the study area at different elevations on stable topographic formations e g painted hard rocks fig 3 b the gcps were measured by real time kinematic global navigation satellite system rtk gnss receivers combined with leica viva gs14 and leica viva cs15 field controllers fig 3 the horizontal and vertical accuracies of the rtk gnss positioning data were approximately 0 01 m and 0 02 m respectively moreover three reference marks postdating the construction of the dam were used in the photogrammetric analysis a dji phantom 4 camera with a resolution of 5472 3648 pixels was used to acquire overhead aerial photographs in this research drone missions were conducted over the reservoir during two field surveys in march 2019 and august 2019 a flash flood occurred between these field surveys enabling us to detect and quantify the changes induced by the sediment deposited during the event using image based techniques with uav derived and scale bar measured values the drone maintained an average altitude of 80 m above the ground surface during flight most of the acquired images were considered to have covered each gcp at least twice in this application two approaches were utilized to quantify and measure the volume of trapped sediment first inverse distance weighting idw interpolation was used to generate raster layers by comparing the sediment scale values collected during the two field surveys with the dems generated via photogrammetric processing idw interpolation which depends on a linear combination of weighted distance samples has been reported to be reliably accurate rishikeshan et al 2014 polat uysal and toprak 2015 arseni et al 2019 the measurements from the nineteen sediment scale bars were input to apply idw interpolation to the selected polygons for the dam reservoir using the spatial analyst toolbox in arcgis 10 8 second the images acquired in the two survey periods were analysed using the commercial software product agisoft metashape initially all high accuracy photos were aligned based on the register alignment received from the simultaneity of a global positioning system gps device in the uav with the default settings namely a key point limit of 40 000 and a tie point limit of 4000 the alignment settings were chosen from the agisoft metashape professional user manual version 1 6 5 with the spatial accuracy increasing from 10 to 1000 m these parameters were selected based on the investigations performed by nesbit nesbit and hugenholtz 2019 for high relief landscapes the collected gcp data were imported and relocated to correct erroneous changes and the cameras were calibrated to the original georeferenced data by using the optimize cameras function then dense point clouds were generated using high quality aggressive depth filtering which previous research has conclusively shown improves the point cloud data density tinkham and swayze 2021 and previous studies have indicated that various point cloud density parameters significantly impact the quality of the results in this study the dense point cloud model was constructed based on overlapping images 50 with the distance between images ranging from 10 to 20 m capable of recognizing matching points tie points finally dems were generated for march 2019 and august 2019 from the dense point clouds at resolutions of 0 09 m and 0 03 m per pixel respectively the reservoir zone was extracted using a similar boundary layer and cell resolution 0 09 m pixel to identify the geomorphological changes between the two survey periods fig 3 seven flash flood events and associated siltation in the reservoir were conducted to assess the interrelation between sediment yield rainfall intensity and flow discharges several monitoring techniques were used for quantifying reservoir sedimentation volumes which were reported by kantoush et al 2022 and based on uav photogrammetry and sediment scale bars before and after floods table 1 summarizes the dates of the flash flood events and computed sediment deposited volumes and weight considering the sediment bulk density of 1 250 kg m3 3 4 data postprocessing large volumes of nutrients and debris are transported in floodwaters and settle in dam reservoirs therefore vegetation such as small shrubs is common in reservoir areas resulting in a point cloud that poorly represents the surface in this study image analysis functions were used to remove unwanted objects including vegetation from the generated dems by computing the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and using the results to identify shrubs in aerial photos then a masking function was applied to exclude pixels containing ndvi values within a defined range from the dems finally the pixels containing no data in the dems were filled based on a combination of plane fitting and idw interpolation techniques with extensive interpolation by using the elevation void fill function raster function template editor in arcgis 10 8 as an alternative we tested the classification option in agisoft photoscan by removing the vegetation cover from the dense point cloud before the dems were generated and similar results were obtained in this method we used the mask shape created by the ndvi to classify the dense point clouds by shape after completing these steps dems of differences dods were used to quantify the volume of sediment trapped in the dam reservoir the basic concept of this method involves differencing the georeferenced dems obtained in two different periods with the resulting raster representing the morphological changes between the two periods cândido et al 2020 the total volume of sediment was computed by multiplying the deposit thickness by the pixel area 4 results 4 1 estimated soil loss the r factor is a function of the distribution of the annual rainfall the minimum and maximum r values were 43 and 90 mj mm ha 1 yr 1 respectively fig 4 a a higher r value was present at high and steep topography in the southern part of the catchment fig 4b shows that the k factor ranged from 0 30 to 0 34 with a mean value of 0 32 the highest soil erodibility was found near the downstream area and along the central part of the catchment which corresponds to the sedimentary surface the distribution of the ls factor ranged from 0 to 40 and the ls value was higher in the southern and northeastern parts of the catchment fig 4c the contribution of the c factor to soil erosion was very minimal with values between 0 042 and 0 052 because the study area is mountainous and is located in the uppermost parts of the basin the soil loss map showed a high correspondence to the pattern of the r and ls factor maps fig 4d the slope steepness and length were responsible for increasing the overland runoff and concentration time thereby increasing soil erosion the computed soil loss in the assarin catchment ranged from zero in the plain area to over 40 ton ha yr 1 with an average annual soil loss of approximately 19 6599 ton ha yr 1 the soil erosion scale upstream of the reservoir catchment was very severe compared to the catchment size therefore the implementation of conservation measures is required in efforts to reduce the erosion process in such areas moreover the selection of suitable sites for dam locations should be considered nearest to the production source of sediment in such mountainous areas of arid regions 4 2 estimated sediment delivery ratio sdr the field measurement data of trapped sediment in the reservoir can be exploited to investigate the relationship between soil erosion and sediment delivery in the basin therefore the sdr values were determined based on the ratio between a different observed scale of sediment yield data and the annual averaged soil loss the sdr of the upstream reservoir catchment varied from 0 020 to 0 058 with an average of 0 033 indeed the sediment delivery strongly corresponded to the hydrological runoff processes in the catchment fig 5 shows a linear relationship between the sdr and the total discharge with a strong positive coefficient of correlation r2 equal to 0 88 as a result the effective runoff is responsible for transporting large amounts of eroded soil from the eroding portions of the catchment to the outlet sediment yield 4 3 idw and dem uncertainties idw analysis depends mainly on the sample value density and distribution in the target area to represent the morphological changes however the primary source of idw uncertainty in this study was the resolution of the scale bars in the dam reservoir on the other hand photogrammetric analysis based on uav derived images was conducted with dense point clouds containing more than 45 million data points and dems were generated for both periods using the workflow shown in fig 6 the dems representing both periods were extracted at a 0 09 m resolution the two drone surveys had only minor differences with regard to their spatial coverage their view of the outer periphery of the study area and their distance from the target zones fig 7 the orthomosaic photographs demonstrate that some zones in the main channel were scoured and affected by flash floods in march 2019 as shown in fig 7a this process occurred during low discharge at which time sediment that had been transported during the previous event settled in the deltaic area upstream of the dam additionally the drone surveys showed the area of excavated sediments that farmers used for agricultural practices fig 7b during the field survey we found depression springs near the dam structure these springs eroded nearby sediments at depths of 10 to 15 cm one instance of which is shown in fig 8 a moreover the exposed terrain surface of the dam reservoir following drying was impacted by extreme weathering causing the sediment to consolidate and resulting in cracking and high bulk densities as shown in fig 8b and 8c the uncertainties on the x y and z axes in the photogrammetric results were calculated using the analysis tools in agisoft photoscan the average errors derived from the root mean square error rmse were approximately 8 and 6 mm for the gcp z axes in march 2019 and august 2019 respectively however some errors occurred due to the lack of gcps in the centre of the reservoir the rmses obtained at the gcp locations and the error estimates for the x y and z axes are shown in table 2 4 4 digital elevation model of differences dod the volumetric change in trapped sediment was detected using multiple overlapping dems by determining the changes in elevation for the same pixels in the reservoir bed between the two periods the dod algorithm was processed in a raster calculator in arcmap 10 8 to measure the morphological changes between the data obtained in the two survey periods additionally the geomorphic change detection tool gcd v7 2 was used to detect the variations between the two dems wheaton et al 2009 özcan and özcan 2021 in this study dems were generated for the two field surveys included in this analysis to estimate the volumes of trapped sediment with an identical cell resolution 0 09 m using esri s arcgis fig 9 dods were then computed from these generated dems by subtracting dem aug 2019 from dem mar 2019 generated dems pre and postflood with the same extent to estimate the net change in the sediment volume the total volume of trapped sediment obtained by the structure from motion sfm technique 9075 m3 was higher than that obtained by the conventional method 7688 m3 mentioned previously in the introduction the idw interpolation result was computed to be 10829 m3 without considering erosion effects comparing the results obtained with the dod and idw approaches reveals that both methods yielded similar ranges for the estimated volume of trapped sediment however a possible explanation for these results is that the scale bar levels were interpolated with idw from a homogeneous elevation whereas in reality all the measured elevations varied therefore the idw results should be considerably different from the volumes of trapped sediment measured by the drone surveys these measurements were produced following a rainfall event with a mean rainfall intensity of 6 7 mm hr 4 5 validation of dods this study s procedures were validated by comparing the differences in the measured sediment elevations between the two periods with those at the same measurement points in the generated dems fig 10 a the maximum elevation difference was 3 cm among the 19 scale bar sites distributed throughout the dam reservoir additionally a significant positive correlation r2 0 82 was found between the sediment elevation changes measured by the sediment scale bars and those determined using the sfm technique fig 10b the scale of sediment accumulation and the rapid increase in sediment deposition near the dam are serious problems that cause the reservoir capacity to drop instantaneously reducing the dam s ability to retain floodwater and protect downstream areas resulting in degradation of the downstream channel bed indeed the morphological characteristics of the reservoir bed should be considered in wadi systems due to the important impacts of the sediment distribution on the efficacy of flood mitigation structures and reservoir capacities as shown in cross sections 1 and 2 a large volume of sediment accumulated on the left side of the reservoir due to differences in elevation and flow in the main channel that occurred during the rising phase of the flash flood fig 11 c1 c2 these sediment deposits were between approximately 10 and 25 cm thick however cross sections 3 and 4 show the erosion process in the upstream area of the reservoir which may have also been affected by the rising phase of the flash flood fig 11 c3 c4 additionally cross section 1 shows smaller erosion zones on both sides of the cross section that were eroded by the water released from the dam reservoir moreover the meandering channel upstream of the dam experienced increased sediment erosion and the sediments from this channel were later deposited close to the dam saber et al 2022 conducted pedon analysis in the assarin dam using the hydrometer method he found that in 2 pedons near the dam the soil texture of the top 1st layer was silty followed by a coarse sandy loam layer with a bulk density of approximately 1 250 kg m3 these findings suggest that drone surveys can be used to construct and inspect sediment elevation curves representing reservoir sedimentation by using data from surveys conducted before and after storms that cause flash floods in this study we estimated the volume of sediment trapped in the wadi assarin catchment in 2019 quantifying the volume of trapped sediment can help explain complex sediment transport mechanisms in catchments 5 discussion 5 1 sediment yield in relation to rainfall intensity quantifying the sediment yield in wadi systems based on monitoring and modelling methods is limited in previous research studies the sediment depth thickness measured from the march 2019 survey represents the total sediment deposition in the dam reservoir since the dam was constructed in 2011 which is equal to the values reported by kantoush et al 2022 the trapped sediment volume based on the sediment scale bar level and idw method between the march 2019 survey and the original reservoir bed was estimated to be approximately 36 270 m3 the flash flood magnitude in the dry wadi channel reflects the rainfall regime fig 12 a shows the rainfall depth values and their corresponding intensities for event durations the available rainfall data showed that rainfall intensities higher than 4 mm hr caused a large amount of erosion and sediment transport conversely rainfall intensities ranging between 2 5 and 3 7 mm hr produced low sediment yields the sediment yield increased with increasing rainfall intensity fig 12b the temporal variation in the intensity of different events is a major factor that impacts the sediment yield in dry environments it has been demonstrated that soil loss increases as the intensity increases from 3 to 5 mm hr ziadat and taimeh 2013 fig 12b shows a positive correlation between the generated sediment yield and the effectiveness of rainfall intensity the soil lost from the watershed due to erosion is transported through the drainage network and temporarily deposited in various stages and locations the estimated annual soil losses from the reservoir watershed equal 196 599 ton ha yr 1 of which approximately 5 8 is trapped in the reservoir based on the drone measurements and 94 0 of the eroded sediment is redeposited in the basin these trapped sediments accumulate over time with the occurrence of flood events 5 2 sediment yield in relation to runoff flow discharge the hydrological responses in the assarin watershed under various rainfall intensities runoff levels and sediment yields were collected over 7 years of monitoring the seven years of existing measured values for the trapped sediments in the assarin reservoir and the runoff discharge were positively correlated with an r2 equal to 0 8 normally obtaining a correlation between runoff discharge and sediment yield during a flood is challenging especially in arid regions the sediment yield data show a relationship between runoff discharge and sediment yield under various flow magnitudes that is a high flow rate yielded the most sediment fig 13 shows the general relationship between the two combined datasets the equation developed by şen 2014 and the observed data in wadi assarin to determine the influence of runoff on sediment yield the observed data trend demonstrates a similar pattern to the developed equation values however this trend is supported by the regular drainage basin size and slope the variations in the eroded sediment volumes from the watershed with runoff discharges can be explained by the rainfall erosivity factor that increases with an increase in intensity and flow rate 5 3 sediment yield monitoring techniques the performance of the digital photogrammetry was validated using point data collected from the 19 sediment scale bars measured in the field using the analysis tools in agisoft photoscan the average rmses were approximately 8 and 6 mm for the gcp z axes in march 2019 and august 2019 respectively these errors could not be considered purely white noise and the correlation was thus modelled empirically each flight required approximately 2 5 hr for the survey and data postprocessing took almost 12 hr the two flights were performed at an average flight altitude of 80 m this research demonstrates that combining digital photogrammetry with uav reconnaissance is a fast and inexpensive way to retrieve the data needed for these applications nevertheless the method utilized herein suffers from some problems first and foremost from a regulatory point of view the ordinances regarding the flying of drones are becoming increasingly restrictive and special authorization is often needed in fact piloting a uav requires a special flying licence in many countries moreover the orography of the surveyed area could represent a further limitation despite these drawbacks the main advantages of drone surveys over traditional topographic surveys become quite evident during the surveying phase drone surveys are faster less expensive and less laborious from a hydrological point of view sedimentation represents a vital issue for dry reservoirs since it reduces the regulation capacities and volumes of reservoirs thus calculating the volume of trapped sediment is necessary for restoring the capacity of a reservoir and financially planning for dam maintenance the volume of trapped sediment was estimated to be approximately 9075 m3 representing approximately 1 26 of the total reservoir capacity this computed volume was validated using the data observed from the monitored sediment scale bars within the assarin dam reservoir resulting in a 79 accuracy these insights which can support reservoir sustainability and sediment management research indicate that photogrammetric techniques utilizing uav derived imagery represent a suitable solution for determining the volume of trapped sediment within a reservoir 6 conclusion this study assesses reservoir sedimentation in arid region wadi assarin oman and analyses the average soil losses at the catchment scale by combining various methodological approaches based on advanced monitoring techniques and hydrological and empirical models the proposed relationship between the spatial distribution of soil loss at the catchment scale and trapped sediment in a dam reservoir is presented the rusle method has shown potential for predicting soil loss in wadi systems using a gis environment and satellite remote sensing data the total estimated soil loss according to the rusle was 196 599 ton ha yr 1 the rainfall erosivity and topography pattern were matched with the soil loss distribution in the target catchment the spatial temporal variability in rainfall patterns and the corresponding runoff discharges lead to high sediment delivery at the outlet of the basin in addition we calculated the volume of trapped sediment in a dry reservoir the assarin dam reservoir located outside muscat oman using data from two uav based photogrammetric field surveys conducted on 17 march 2019 and 25 august 2019 before and after a flash flood event respectively the trapped sediment volume was estimated to be approximately 9 075 m3 representing approximately 1 26 of the total reservoir capacity in comparison interpolation yielded a value of 10829 m3 with caveats this volume represents approximately 5 8 of the total eroded sediment lost from the catchment area the sdr results for the seven events ranged from 2 to 5 8 the sediment yield from wadi assarin generally increased as runoff discharge increased with the model developed by şen 2014 and observed datasets matching both degrees and trends in the mena region most of the basins are ungauged therefore the adoption of a statistical model and investigation are important to understand the soil erosion and sedimentation processes credit authorship contribution statement

2542,soil erosion sediment yield and sediment transport associated with flash flooding in arid regions result in reservoir storage losses decreased infiltration high evaporation rates and degradation of downstream channels however the lack of observational data from wadi systems and an empirical formula to compute sediment yield has hindered reservoir trapping evaluation maintenance and management therefore this research aimed to estimate the annual soil loss in the upstream catchment area of a reservoir based on the revised universal soil loss equation rusle with a remote sensing dataset the sediment trapped in the assarin dam reservoir in oman was estimated by coupling unmanned aerial vehicle uav surveys with photogrammetry analysis to assess the reservoir siltation among the previous sediment trapping events seven sets of field observation data were collected to investigate the relationship between soil loss at the catchment scale and sediment deposition volumes in the reservoir the rusle method was applied to estimate soil erosion using independent factors such as rainfall erosivity soil erodibility topography cover management and conservation practices a remote sensing dataset and geographic information system gis environments were used to analyse the quantitative and spatial distribution of the rusle parameters two drone surveys were conducted over the reservoir before and after a flash flood the trapped sediment volume was estimated to be approximately 9 075 m3 11 343 ton per event representing approximately 1 26 of the total reservoir capacity this computed volume was validated using measurements from monitored sediment scale bars sited throughout the assarin dam reservoir yielding an accuracy of 79 from the rusle results the annual soil erosion was estimated to be 196 599 ton ha yr 1 of which approximately 5 8 was trapped in the reservoir spatial temporal variability in the rainfall patterns and the corresponding runoff discharges led to high sediment delivery at the outlet of the basin after analysing available data from previous field surveys in oman a new formula for estimating the sediment yield in wadi assarin was developed the results of this research which represent the first of their type in the middle east and north africa mena region can support reservoir management practices and show that uav based photogrammetry is suitable for measuring trapped sediment volumes keywords reservoir sedimentation uav arid region wadi sediment delivery ratio data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction although flash floods are essential sources of groundwater recharge they are also highly destructive natural disasters in the middle east and north africa mena al mamari et al 2019 therefore retention dams have been constructed to intercept these surface flows and prevent them from draining into the sea or the desert abdel fattah et al 2016 the critical issue associated with such dams worldwide is reservoir sedimentation which is controlled by geological hydraulic and hydrological factors george et al 2017 in particular high intensity and long duration rainfall events in arid regions cause extreme weathering of the land surface malmon et al 2007 and dry environments commonly exhibit steep and bare surface landforms and landscapes thus increasing sediment production in these regions moreover flash floods in dry areas can be severe and can influence sediment dynamics and sediment transport elçi et al 2007 dam reservoirs and downstream channels suffer from several problems as a result of sedimentation such as storage capacity losses reservoir bed clogging and channel degradation furthermore dam conditions in arid regions differ from those in humid areas specifically the weathering processes resulting from high temperatures strong winds drought and rainfall erosivity directly impact reservoir sedimentation accordingly the soil bulk density increases with decreasing infiltration al ismaily et al 2013 therefore floodwater is stored in a reservoir for only a short period weeks before being released to groundwater recharge downstream of the dam without considering sediment transport prathapar and bawain 2014 in oman the original storage capacity of the al khoud reservoir amounting to 11 6 million cubic metres decreased by more than 30 due to sedimentation between 1985 and 2015 al saqri et al 2016 moreover the international commission on large dams icold 2009 reported that many mena countries will experience high reservoir sedimentation volumes by 2050 however observed sedimentation data are unavailable in most mena regions many of which lack sediment gauging stations consequently measuring the amount of sediment in a reservoir is an integral component of dam operation and water resource management accordingly this study aims to assess the performance of a potential sediment management technique in a wadi catchment however quantifying sediment yield is challenging and our scientific understanding of sediment yields in arid environments remains incomplete due to the lack of observed data and in depth research the direct and indirect techniques for measuring sedimentation in reservoirs differ from those in perennial and ephemeral streams the typical monitoring methods of sedimentation in river systems involve bathymetric measurements using instruments such as an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp and multibeam and single beam sonar miranda 2021 asthana and khare 2022 in ephemeral streams two main common monitoring techniques have been used in dry environments to estimate reservoir siltation first sediment scale bars have been utilized in dry reservoirs saber et al 2019 these scale bars are distributed throughout a reservoir and provide local point measurements which are then averaged and multiplied by the basin area of the reservoir to estimate the volume of trapped sediment second multiple topographic surveys using total station measurements have been conducted to measure the amount of sediment deposited in dam reservoirs before and after floods however while this technique provides data on suspended and bedload materials that are more reliable and quantifiable than those from sediment scale bar surveys adongo et al 2020 shiferaw and abebe 2021 this method requires more time and is limited to the survey area encompassing the measurement points several tools have been developed to predict soil erosion and sediment yields including sediment rating curves tebbi et al 2012 numerical models and regional sediment yield estimates renard and lane n d ghernaout and remini 2014 dutta 2016 bulti 2021 and the trap efficiency of reservoirs brune 1953 understanding soil loss at the catchment scale is vital for arranging and planning mitigation structures and managing sedimentation in existing reservoirs in an investigation into soil conservation three main variables for soil erosion were identified cook 1937 this study found that the potential of rainfall erosivity runoff and the index of soil protectivity by plant cover had a more significant impact on soil erosion wischmeier and smith 1978 developed an empirical soil loss equation the universal soil loss equation usle to estimate soil erosion using erosion variable factors under specific conditions however a limitation of the usle method is the prediction of the spatial distribution of soil erosion at the watershed scale the revised universal soil loss equation rusle developed for soil losses at the catchment scale is straightforward and applicable to integration with geographic information system gis environments renard 1997 kirurhika et al 2011 studied soil erosion in india and found that approximately 0 16 ton km yr 1 occurred furthermore 10 was deposited in reservoirs and 29 was transported to the sea soil erosion prediction in arid regions is challenging due to climatic and hydrological variations previous research has investigated soil loss in wadi systems and found high soil erosion levels of 40 ton km yr 1 using the rusle method elhag et al 2022 additionally several studies have integrated the rusle model with high resolution sensors to map and monitor soil erosion eniyew et al 2021 kulimushi et al 2021 the sediment yield in wadi channels at any location in the catchment results from soil erosion in gullies transport deposition and other erosion processes in the channels the susceptibility of soil to erosion can increase due to various factors such as soil characteristics ostovari et al 2022 slope processes guerra et al 2017 and drainage area wasson 1994 in addition to the rainfall pattern integrating rainfall runoff and sediment transport models has become a principal tool for water resource assessment however this method depends on the data availability and hydrological responses of each subbasin according to the rainfall variability sediment yields in the saudi arabian wadi system were reported in the first model which was derived using the general dimensional analysis method şen 2014 satellite remote sensing methods have been widely used to detect geomorphological changes in combination with field measurements although open source remotely sensed data typically have a coarse resolution yousefi et al 2021 in recent years the ground based lidar technique has been widely used with high accuracy to generate digital elevation models dems or scan 3d objects in combination with photogrammetry analysis however the lidar technique is costly and more effective for local scale investigations rogers et al 2020 the use of unmanned aerial systems uass with photogrammetry analysis can yield high spatial coverage good accessibility and high accuracy salach et al 2018 these concepts vary depending on the condition and scale of the research area developments in remote sensing have led to relatively inexpensive and rapidly deployable devices such as unmanned aerial vehicles uavs with which erosion and deposition processes can be mapped and quantified at increasingly fine spatial resolutions at present empirical algorithms are continuously being transferred from existing remote sensing technologies to uavs considering that monitoring and investigating the transport of sediment require accurate high resolution spatial data representing the earth s surface clapuyt et al 2016 uavs also called drones and photogrammetric processing techniques allow very high resolution river data to be acquired nearly effortlessly other geoscientific applications of photogrammetry techniques include the detection of fluvial changes in a river system tamminga et al 2015 and geomorphic observations of a landslide tsunetaka et al 2020 combining these techniques could provide an economical and rapid solution for monitoring reservoir sedimentation in arid regions therefore this research aimed to estimate soil loss upstream of a reservoir catchment using the rusle approach and its association with trapped sediment in the reservoir the volume of sediment trapped in a dam reservoir was quantified with acceptable and representative values by using multitemporal drone and field surveys combined with photogrammetric analysis with the total volume of sedimentation being estimated using the level of sediment measured with sediment scale bars the workflow of the multitemporal topographic surveys conducted herein required the acquisition of considerable data and the implementation of numerous postprocessing steps finally a sediment yield formula is proposed based on an analysis of the available data 2 study area the study area is the assarin dam located southeast of muscat 2571416 15 m n 660927 40 m e the capital of oman fig 1 the assarin dam was constructed in 2011 after an extreme tropical cyclone named gonu caused severe damage to the infrastructure and property in the region usually dams in wadi systems are built for multiple functions such as flood control groundwater recharge and water storage the assarin dam reservoir has a capacity of 0 72 million cubic metres and a catchment area of 81 km2 8 100 ha ministry of regional municipalities water 2012 the catchment is geologically underlain by numerous sedimentary rock formations and features a valley with steep slopes at elevations ranging from 1000 m to more than 1300 m above the mean sea level moraetis et al 2020 in oman sediments trapped in dam reservoirs are irregularly removed by excavation without measurement or monitoring systems within the upstream catchment of the dam reservoir no monitoring data were available therefore precipitation satellite data were used 3 materials and methodology the methodology combined different approaches from field measurements remote sensing analysis hydrological and rusle models to assess reservoir siltation and estimate the sediment yield from the catchment in the wadi basin fig 2 shows the proposed flowchart of the detailed methodological approaches suitable for the wadi basins in arid areas further details for each approach are described in the following subsections for instance in section 3 1 the rusle and five different factors namely rainfall erosivity r soil erodibility k slope length and steepness ls cover management c and practice management p are introduced to estimate the average annual soil erosion in the catchment additionally a field investigation and drone survey were performed to understand the reservoir siltation and quantify the sediment yield as described in sections 3 2 3 3 and 3 4 moreover the extreme events that caused flash floods and transported sediment deposited in the reservoir were computed finally the sediment delivery ratio is determined from the sediment measured from the field surveys and the gross erosion per unit area is calculated with the rusle 3 1 rusle the rusle method to predict soil erosion has been widely used for estimating annual soil loss at the watershed scale using independent factors based on the gasemt database approximately 507 studies and investigations have used the rusle method borrelli et al 2021 the rusle has been used in various dry environments such as jordan farhan and nawaiseh 2015 egypt elnashar et al 2021 algeria melalih and mazour 2021 and iraq and iran allafta and opp 2022 the rusle equation yields the soil erosion per unit area in unit time which is expressed as 1 a r k l s c p where r is the rainfall erosivity factor mj mm h 1 ha 1 yr 1 k is the soil erodibility factor ton ha h ha mj 1 mm 1 ls is the slope length and steepness factor dimensionless c is the cover management factor and p is the conservation practice dimensionless all of which are factors used for the estimation of the average annual soil loss a ton ha yr 1 the raster layers of rainfall erosivity and soil erodibility were calculated and extracted from the google earth engine gee wang and zhao 2020 islam 2022 3 1 1 data sources and processing 3 1 1 1 rainfall erosivity factor r due to the lack of observed hydrological data and the nonhomogeneous spatial distributions of ground stations in most of the wadi systems in arid environments a satellite precipitation dataset was used to determine the rainfall erosivity therefore the monthly precipitation dataset with a downscaled 1 0 km2 resolution from sm2rain ascat was applied to calculate the r factor over the catchment area in eq 2 wischmeier and smith 1978 2 r 1 73 10 1 5 l o g p m 2 p a 0 08188 where r is the rainfall erosivity in mj mm ha 1h 1 yr 1 pm is the monthly precipitation mm and pa is the yearly precipitation mm the accuracy of the satellite precipitation dataset was investigated and tested with regional observation data in iran which neighbours oman to the north and the results showed that sm2rain ascat had better accuracy than persian ccs and cmorph with root square mean errors rmses of 2 4 mm 4 36 mm and 28 83 mm respectively eini et al 2021 the annual average rainfall in the reservoir catchment was 104 mm in total seven significant flood events were recorded in wadi assarin from 2011 to 2019 ranging from 27 4 to 134 4 mm with rainfall intensities ranging from 2 6 to 6 7 mm hr at the nearest available gauge station to the catchment fig 10a these rainfall intensities over bare land in arid regions cause high erosivity due to the kinetic energy of raindrops additionally the shear stress induced by flash floods passing over dry channel beds increases sediment transport from the drainage network to the reservoir azab et al 2021 the available data from the surrounding catchments demonstrate that the reservoir in the wadi assarin is exposed to one extreme flash flood per year which was confirmed by pedon analysis 3 1 1 2 soil erodibility k the k factor represents the resistance of soil to erosion from the impacts of kinetic energy from raindrops this factor depends on the soil structure texture organic content and porosity the soilgrids250 m dataset was used to estimate the soil texture sand clay and silt content and organic carbon content to compute the k factor using eq 3 sharpley and williams 1990 hengl et al 2017 3 k 0 2 0 3 e x p 0 0256 s a n 1 s i l 100 1 0 25 c l a cla e x p 3 72 2 95 c l a where san sil and cla are the percentages of sand silt and clay respectively the k factor was calculated using eq 3 in gee 3 1 1 3 topography factor ls the ls factor represents the topographical effect on soil erosion based on slope length and steepness which can accelerate the effects of rainfall the ls factor includes the flow accumulation and slope degree determined from the dem with a 5 metre resolution national survey authority oman the ls was calculated using eq 4 moore et al 1991 4 ls 0 4 1 flowaccmulation c e l l s i z e 22 13 0 4 sin s l o p e 0 0896 1 3 where l and s describe slope length and steepness dimensionless flow accumulation represents the cumulative upslope of cells that contribute to flow for a particular cell cell size equals the size of the grid cell and sine slope equals the sin of the slope angle in degrees 3 1 1 4 cover management factor c the impacts of land cover and plant management upstream of the reservoir catchment are very limited the ndvi was obtained from landsat 8 satellite images using red and near infrared wavebands and the c factor was estimated with the following equation durigon et al 2014 5 c 0 1 n d v i 1 2 where ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index 3 1 1 4 1 management practice factor p overall no central conservation practice in the target study area affects the hydrodynamics of flash floods in previous research a p value of 1 was assumed for all watersheds in arid regions gaubi et al 2017 3 2 sediment yield runoff relationship in the wadi system developing empirical approaches and charts for specific conditions and regions is essential for obtaining and understanding these phenomena the lack of observational data is the major challenge in evaluating the sediment yield in arid regions kantoush et al 2022 conducted field surveys to estimate the trapped sediments in the assarin dam reservoir for different periods using the sediment scale bar and gis environments the discharge of the watershed was simulated by using the rainfall runoff inundation rri model without dams to calibrate and validate the model with the downstream gauging station their results which included drone measurements were compared with predicted sediment yield values from the sediment yield model developed by şen 2014 for another wadi system the empirical model in eq 6 was used only for comparative purposes the model identified and analysed the sediment yield in the wadi system using physical relations and the calculation of some correlated variables in the catchment with homogeneous dimensions the four most significant variables were selected to develop the following sediment yield equation 6 s y 0 0001 s q a where sy is the sediment yield s is the mean channel slope dimensionless q is the discharge m3 s and a is the catchment area km2 the sediment yield was estimated for several subcatchments upstream of the wadi jizan dam in southwestern saudi arabia 3 3 field survey and photogrammetry in this study field and drone surveys were conducted to estimate the volume of sediment trapped in a wadi system reservoir in an arid region the spillway and sluice gate of the assarin dam are located in the high stage which reduces the vulnerability of fine and coarse sediment transport from the reservoir to the downstream channel additionally the water was stored in the reservoir for more than two weeks before being released downstream to promote the groundwater recharge process the flash flood that occurred between field surveys in the wadi assarin filled the dam reservoir without a spillway therefore it can be assumed that the trapped sediment is equal to the sediment yield a total of 19 sediment scale bars pegs were installed throughout the reservoir based on the bed elevation to measure sediment deposition during the construction of the assarin dam fig 3 b the sediment scale bars were installed with two different post heights eleven bars located near the dam have a height of 1 5 m while the other 8 bars have a height of 1 m to investigate the siltation in the reservoir and determine the sediment volume two drone surveys were conducted in the dam reservoir one on 17 march 2019 yielding 223 images and one on 25 august 2019 yielding 430 images the readings from sediment scale bars reveal the variance in the distribution of sediment deposits across the reservoir due to previous flash floods which eroded the reservoir bed before the sediments were retained by the dam body fig 3 a shows the sediment bar readings obtained in two periods before and after a flood event and their corresponding locations throughout the dam reservoir a total of 15 ground control points gcps were sited around the study area at different elevations on stable topographic formations e g painted hard rocks fig 3 b the gcps were measured by real time kinematic global navigation satellite system rtk gnss receivers combined with leica viva gs14 and leica viva cs15 field controllers fig 3 the horizontal and vertical accuracies of the rtk gnss positioning data were approximately 0 01 m and 0 02 m respectively moreover three reference marks postdating the construction of the dam were used in the photogrammetric analysis a dji phantom 4 camera with a resolution of 5472 3648 pixels was used to acquire overhead aerial photographs in this research drone missions were conducted over the reservoir during two field surveys in march 2019 and august 2019 a flash flood occurred between these field surveys enabling us to detect and quantify the changes induced by the sediment deposited during the event using image based techniques with uav derived and scale bar measured values the drone maintained an average altitude of 80 m above the ground surface during flight most of the acquired images were considered to have covered each gcp at least twice in this application two approaches were utilized to quantify and measure the volume of trapped sediment first inverse distance weighting idw interpolation was used to generate raster layers by comparing the sediment scale values collected during the two field surveys with the dems generated via photogrammetric processing idw interpolation which depends on a linear combination of weighted distance samples has been reported to be reliably accurate rishikeshan et al 2014 polat uysal and toprak 2015 arseni et al 2019 the measurements from the nineteen sediment scale bars were input to apply idw interpolation to the selected polygons for the dam reservoir using the spatial analyst toolbox in arcgis 10 8 second the images acquired in the two survey periods were analysed using the commercial software product agisoft metashape initially all high accuracy photos were aligned based on the register alignment received from the simultaneity of a global positioning system gps device in the uav with the default settings namely a key point limit of 40 000 and a tie point limit of 4000 the alignment settings were chosen from the agisoft metashape professional user manual version 1 6 5 with the spatial accuracy increasing from 10 to 1000 m these parameters were selected based on the investigations performed by nesbit nesbit and hugenholtz 2019 for high relief landscapes the collected gcp data were imported and relocated to correct erroneous changes and the cameras were calibrated to the original georeferenced data by using the optimize cameras function then dense point clouds were generated using high quality aggressive depth filtering which previous research has conclusively shown improves the point cloud data density tinkham and swayze 2021 and previous studies have indicated that various point cloud density parameters significantly impact the quality of the results in this study the dense point cloud model was constructed based on overlapping images 50 with the distance between images ranging from 10 to 20 m capable of recognizing matching points tie points finally dems were generated for march 2019 and august 2019 from the dense point clouds at resolutions of 0 09 m and 0 03 m per pixel respectively the reservoir zone was extracted using a similar boundary layer and cell resolution 0 09 m pixel to identify the geomorphological changes between the two survey periods fig 3 seven flash flood events and associated siltation in the reservoir were conducted to assess the interrelation between sediment yield rainfall intensity and flow discharges several monitoring techniques were used for quantifying reservoir sedimentation volumes which were reported by kantoush et al 2022 and based on uav photogrammetry and sediment scale bars before and after floods table 1 summarizes the dates of the flash flood events and computed sediment deposited volumes and weight considering the sediment bulk density of 1 250 kg m3 3 4 data postprocessing large volumes of nutrients and debris are transported in floodwaters and settle in dam reservoirs therefore vegetation such as small shrubs is common in reservoir areas resulting in a point cloud that poorly represents the surface in this study image analysis functions were used to remove unwanted objects including vegetation from the generated dems by computing the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and using the results to identify shrubs in aerial photos then a masking function was applied to exclude pixels containing ndvi values within a defined range from the dems finally the pixels containing no data in the dems were filled based on a combination of plane fitting and idw interpolation techniques with extensive interpolation by using the elevation void fill function raster function template editor in arcgis 10 8 as an alternative we tested the classification option in agisoft photoscan by removing the vegetation cover from the dense point cloud before the dems were generated and similar results were obtained in this method we used the mask shape created by the ndvi to classify the dense point clouds by shape after completing these steps dems of differences dods were used to quantify the volume of sediment trapped in the dam reservoir the basic concept of this method involves differencing the georeferenced dems obtained in two different periods with the resulting raster representing the morphological changes between the two periods cândido et al 2020 the total volume of sediment was computed by multiplying the deposit thickness by the pixel area 4 results 4 1 estimated soil loss the r factor is a function of the distribution of the annual rainfall the minimum and maximum r values were 43 and 90 mj mm ha 1 yr 1 respectively fig 4 a a higher r value was present at high and steep topography in the southern part of the catchment fig 4b shows that the k factor ranged from 0 30 to 0 34 with a mean value of 0 32 the highest soil erodibility was found near the downstream area and along the central part of the catchment which corresponds to the sedimentary surface the distribution of the ls factor ranged from 0 to 40 and the ls value was higher in the southern and northeastern parts of the catchment fig 4c the contribution of the c factor to soil erosion was very minimal with values between 0 042 and 0 052 because the study area is mountainous and is located in the uppermost parts of the basin the soil loss map showed a high correspondence to the pattern of the r and ls factor maps fig 4d the slope steepness and length were responsible for increasing the overland runoff and concentration time thereby increasing soil erosion the computed soil loss in the assarin catchment ranged from zero in the plain area to over 40 ton ha yr 1 with an average annual soil loss of approximately 19 6599 ton ha yr 1 the soil erosion scale upstream of the reservoir catchment was very severe compared to the catchment size therefore the implementation of conservation measures is required in efforts to reduce the erosion process in such areas moreover the selection of suitable sites for dam locations should be considered nearest to the production source of sediment in such mountainous areas of arid regions 4 2 estimated sediment delivery ratio sdr the field measurement data of trapped sediment in the reservoir can be exploited to investigate the relationship between soil erosion and sediment delivery in the basin therefore the sdr values were determined based on the ratio between a different observed scale of sediment yield data and the annual averaged soil loss the sdr of the upstream reservoir catchment varied from 0 020 to 0 058 with an average of 0 033 indeed the sediment delivery strongly corresponded to the hydrological runoff processes in the catchment fig 5 shows a linear relationship between the sdr and the total discharge with a strong positive coefficient of correlation r2 equal to 0 88 as a result the effective runoff is responsible for transporting large amounts of eroded soil from the eroding portions of the catchment to the outlet sediment yield 4 3 idw and dem uncertainties idw analysis depends mainly on the sample value density and distribution in the target area to represent the morphological changes however the primary source of idw uncertainty in this study was the resolution of the scale bars in the dam reservoir on the other hand photogrammetric analysis based on uav derived images was conducted with dense point clouds containing more than 45 million data points and dems were generated for both periods using the workflow shown in fig 6 the dems representing both periods were extracted at a 0 09 m resolution the two drone surveys had only minor differences with regard to their spatial coverage their view of the outer periphery of the study area and their distance from the target zones fig 7 the orthomosaic photographs demonstrate that some zones in the main channel were scoured and affected by flash floods in march 2019 as shown in fig 7a this process occurred during low discharge at which time sediment that had been transported during the previous event settled in the deltaic area upstream of the dam additionally the drone surveys showed the area of excavated sediments that farmers used for agricultural practices fig 7b during the field survey we found depression springs near the dam structure these springs eroded nearby sediments at depths of 10 to 15 cm one instance of which is shown in fig 8 a moreover the exposed terrain surface of the dam reservoir following drying was impacted by extreme weathering causing the sediment to consolidate and resulting in cracking and high bulk densities as shown in fig 8b and 8c the uncertainties on the x y and z axes in the photogrammetric results were calculated using the analysis tools in agisoft photoscan the average errors derived from the root mean square error rmse were approximately 8 and 6 mm for the gcp z axes in march 2019 and august 2019 respectively however some errors occurred due to the lack of gcps in the centre of the reservoir the rmses obtained at the gcp locations and the error estimates for the x y and z axes are shown in table 2 4 4 digital elevation model of differences dod the volumetric change in trapped sediment was detected using multiple overlapping dems by determining the changes in elevation for the same pixels in the reservoir bed between the two periods the dod algorithm was processed in a raster calculator in arcmap 10 8 to measure the morphological changes between the data obtained in the two survey periods additionally the geomorphic change detection tool gcd v7 2 was used to detect the variations between the two dems wheaton et al 2009 özcan and özcan 2021 in this study dems were generated for the two field surveys included in this analysis to estimate the volumes of trapped sediment with an identical cell resolution 0 09 m using esri s arcgis fig 9 dods were then computed from these generated dems by subtracting dem aug 2019 from dem mar 2019 generated dems pre and postflood with the same extent to estimate the net change in the sediment volume the total volume of trapped sediment obtained by the structure from motion sfm technique 9075 m3 was higher than that obtained by the conventional method 7688 m3 mentioned previously in the introduction the idw interpolation result was computed to be 10829 m3 without considering erosion effects comparing the results obtained with the dod and idw approaches reveals that both methods yielded similar ranges for the estimated volume of trapped sediment however a possible explanation for these results is that the scale bar levels were interpolated with idw from a homogeneous elevation whereas in reality all the measured elevations varied therefore the idw results should be considerably different from the volumes of trapped sediment measured by the drone surveys these measurements were produced following a rainfall event with a mean rainfall intensity of 6 7 mm hr 4 5 validation of dods this study s procedures were validated by comparing the differences in the measured sediment elevations between the two periods with those at the same measurement points in the generated dems fig 10 a the maximum elevation difference was 3 cm among the 19 scale bar sites distributed throughout the dam reservoir additionally a significant positive correlation r2 0 82 was found between the sediment elevation changes measured by the sediment scale bars and those determined using the sfm technique fig 10b the scale of sediment accumulation and the rapid increase in sediment deposition near the dam are serious problems that cause the reservoir capacity to drop instantaneously reducing the dam s ability to retain floodwater and protect downstream areas resulting in degradation of the downstream channel bed indeed the morphological characteristics of the reservoir bed should be considered in wadi systems due to the important impacts of the sediment distribution on the efficacy of flood mitigation structures and reservoir capacities as shown in cross sections 1 and 2 a large volume of sediment accumulated on the left side of the reservoir due to differences in elevation and flow in the main channel that occurred during the rising phase of the flash flood fig 11 c1 c2 these sediment deposits were between approximately 10 and 25 cm thick however cross sections 3 and 4 show the erosion process in the upstream area of the reservoir which may have also been affected by the rising phase of the flash flood fig 11 c3 c4 additionally cross section 1 shows smaller erosion zones on both sides of the cross section that were eroded by the water released from the dam reservoir moreover the meandering channel upstream of the dam experienced increased sediment erosion and the sediments from this channel were later deposited close to the dam saber et al 2022 conducted pedon analysis in the assarin dam using the hydrometer method he found that in 2 pedons near the dam the soil texture of the top 1st layer was silty followed by a coarse sandy loam layer with a bulk density of approximately 1 250 kg m3 these findings suggest that drone surveys can be used to construct and inspect sediment elevation curves representing reservoir sedimentation by using data from surveys conducted before and after storms that cause flash floods in this study we estimated the volume of sediment trapped in the wadi assarin catchment in 2019 quantifying the volume of trapped sediment can help explain complex sediment transport mechanisms in catchments 5 discussion 5 1 sediment yield in relation to rainfall intensity quantifying the sediment yield in wadi systems based on monitoring and modelling methods is limited in previous research studies the sediment depth thickness measured from the march 2019 survey represents the total sediment deposition in the dam reservoir since the dam was constructed in 2011 which is equal to the values reported by kantoush et al 2022 the trapped sediment volume based on the sediment scale bar level and idw method between the march 2019 survey and the original reservoir bed was estimated to be approximately 36 270 m3 the flash flood magnitude in the dry wadi channel reflects the rainfall regime fig 12 a shows the rainfall depth values and their corresponding intensities for event durations the available rainfall data showed that rainfall intensities higher than 4 mm hr caused a large amount of erosion and sediment transport conversely rainfall intensities ranging between 2 5 and 3 7 mm hr produced low sediment yields the sediment yield increased with increasing rainfall intensity fig 12b the temporal variation in the intensity of different events is a major factor that impacts the sediment yield in dry environments it has been demonstrated that soil loss increases as the intensity increases from 3 to 5 mm hr ziadat and taimeh 2013 fig 12b shows a positive correlation between the generated sediment yield and the effectiveness of rainfall intensity the soil lost from the watershed due to erosion is transported through the drainage network and temporarily deposited in various stages and locations the estimated annual soil losses from the reservoir watershed equal 196 599 ton ha yr 1 of which approximately 5 8 is trapped in the reservoir based on the drone measurements and 94 0 of the eroded sediment is redeposited in the basin these trapped sediments accumulate over time with the occurrence of flood events 5 2 sediment yield in relation to runoff flow discharge the hydrological responses in the assarin watershed under various rainfall intensities runoff levels and sediment yields were collected over 7 years of monitoring the seven years of existing measured values for the trapped sediments in the assarin reservoir and the runoff discharge were positively correlated with an r2 equal to 0 8 normally obtaining a correlation between runoff discharge and sediment yield during a flood is challenging especially in arid regions the sediment yield data show a relationship between runoff discharge and sediment yield under various flow magnitudes that is a high flow rate yielded the most sediment fig 13 shows the general relationship between the two combined datasets the equation developed by şen 2014 and the observed data in wadi assarin to determine the influence of runoff on sediment yield the observed data trend demonstrates a similar pattern to the developed equation values however this trend is supported by the regular drainage basin size and slope the variations in the eroded sediment volumes from the watershed with runoff discharges can be explained by the rainfall erosivity factor that increases with an increase in intensity and flow rate 5 3 sediment yield monitoring techniques the performance of the digital photogrammetry was validated using point data collected from the 19 sediment scale bars measured in the field using the analysis tools in agisoft photoscan the average rmses were approximately 8 and 6 mm for the gcp z axes in march 2019 and august 2019 respectively these errors could not be considered purely white noise and the correlation was thus modelled empirically each flight required approximately 2 5 hr for the survey and data postprocessing took almost 12 hr the two flights were performed at an average flight altitude of 80 m this research demonstrates that combining digital photogrammetry with uav reconnaissance is a fast and inexpensive way to retrieve the data needed for these applications nevertheless the method utilized herein suffers from some problems first and foremost from a regulatory point of view the ordinances regarding the flying of drones are becoming increasingly restrictive and special authorization is often needed in fact piloting a uav requires a special flying licence in many countries moreover the orography of the surveyed area could represent a further limitation despite these drawbacks the main advantages of drone surveys over traditional topographic surveys become quite evident during the surveying phase drone surveys are faster less expensive and less laborious from a hydrological point of view sedimentation represents a vital issue for dry reservoirs since it reduces the regulation capacities and volumes of reservoirs thus calculating the volume of trapped sediment is necessary for restoring the capacity of a reservoir and financially planning for dam maintenance the volume of trapped sediment was estimated to be approximately 9075 m3 representing approximately 1 26 of the total reservoir capacity this computed volume was validated using the data observed from the monitored sediment scale bars within the assarin dam reservoir resulting in a 79 accuracy these insights which can support reservoir sustainability and sediment management research indicate that photogrammetric techniques utilizing uav derived imagery represent a suitable solution for determining the volume of trapped sediment within a reservoir 6 conclusion this study assesses reservoir sedimentation in arid region wadi assarin oman and analyses the average soil losses at the catchment scale by combining various methodological approaches based on advanced monitoring techniques and hydrological and empirical models the proposed relationship between the spatial distribution of soil loss at the catchment scale and trapped sediment in a dam reservoir is presented the rusle method has shown potential for predicting soil loss in wadi systems using a gis environment and satellite remote sensing data the total estimated soil loss according to the rusle was 196 599 ton ha yr 1 the rainfall erosivity and topography pattern were matched with the soil loss distribution in the target catchment the spatial temporal variability in rainfall patterns and the corresponding runoff discharges lead to high sediment delivery at the outlet of the basin in addition we calculated the volume of trapped sediment in a dry reservoir the assarin dam reservoir located outside muscat oman using data from two uav based photogrammetric field surveys conducted on 17 march 2019 and 25 august 2019 before and after a flash flood event respectively the trapped sediment volume was estimated to be approximately 9 075 m3 representing approximately 1 26 of the total reservoir capacity in comparison interpolation yielded a value of 10829 m3 with caveats this volume represents approximately 5 8 of the total eroded sediment lost from the catchment area the sdr results for the seven events ranged from 2 to 5 8 the sediment yield from wadi assarin generally increased as runoff discharge increased with the model developed by şen 2014 and observed datasets matching both degrees and trends in the mena region most of the basins are ungauged therefore the adoption of a statistical model and investigation are important to understand the soil erosion and sedimentation processes credit authorship contribution statement

2543,with the accelerated climate change the selection of globe warming related drought monitoring tools is vitally significant to select the most suitable multi source precipitation product for drought monitoring this study comprehensively evaluated the performance of 7 latest version of multi source precipitation estimate products mpes including persiann cdr chirps era5 merra2 aphrodite gpcc and mswep and compared their drought monitoring applicability combined with gleam potential evapotranspiration etp product based on the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei during 1983 2015 over china the spei estimated by the china monthly precipitation analysis product cpap was used as the reference to assess their performance in addition the drought area ratio frequency duration and intensity were analyzed based on the multi threshold run theory the results showed that 1 the precision of mpes was higher in eastern china but lower in western china and the overall accuracy of mpes summarized as 4 levels from top to end respectively was gpcc and aphrodite merra2 and mswep chirps and persiann cdr as well as era5 gleam etp performed well in eastern china but poor in western china with large underestimations 2 the applicability of mpes in drought monitoring was regional specific low in parts of northwest desert and qinghai tibet plateau but high in other areas the accuracy of estimated spei for most mpes dropped with expanding timescale in most sub regions among of mpes gpcc product comprehensively performed best in drought monitoring 3 drought events occurring in northern china were usually with larger area ratio lower frequency and longer duration than other regions drought events had an exacerbating trend in southeastern china overall

drought is one of the most universal and destructive natural hazards which can impose considerable adverse impacts on economic growth agricultural production social stability and even human survival wang et al 2018 lai et al 2019 heydari alamdarloo et al 2020 in recent years climate change and human activities have been exacerbating the frequency intensity duration and spatial extent of drought disasters cook et al 2014 trenberth et al 2014 wang et al 2018 china with its sophisticated climatic conditions large population fragile ecosystem and soaring economy is sensitive to climate change and drought disasters ju et al 2013 wu et al 2020 bai et al 2021 to guard against and mitigate drought caused damage it is of a huge significance for china to monitor and track the evolution of drought characters more accurately especially for spatial pattern bayissa et al 2015 bayissa et al 2017 li et al 2020 drought is commonly classified as four categories meteorological agricultural hydrologic and socio economic drought in accordance with their hydrological cycle process society 1997 wu et al 2016 the meteorological drought is the most predominant one which is a crucial natural trigger of the other three kinds of drought nasrollahi et al 2018 west et al 2019 alamdarloo et al 2021 the meteorological drought monitoring mainly depends on drought indices which contain the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1968 the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 the effective drought index edi byun and wilhite 1999 the z index yao et al 2007 and spei vicente serrano et al 2010 etc among of these spei was proposed by incorporating etp estimates into the structure of spi estimates of etp were closely related to the temperature variability which can be affected by global warming continuous global warming also contributes considerably to the occurrence and intensity of drought by enhancing evapotranspiration kim and rhee 2016 thus spei with a relatively brief calculation flexible scales and the consideration of the effect of global warming has been the first choice for drought monitoring wang et al 2017a zhang et al 2018 bai et al 2020 however traditional spei index is commonly computed in site scale since its key components are mainly derived from meteorological stations whose placement is seriously limited by geographic and economic elements ma et al 2021 it is too vulnerable to sufficiently reflect large scale dynamic drought information wang et al 2019 although spatial interpolation can compensate for this it still introduces non negligible errors wang et al 2017b nowadays an increasing number of high resolution multi source meteorological products have been available particularly for evapotranspiration and precipitation liu et al 2019 ma et al 2021 and it is possible for them to be applied in the calculation of spei recently there were numerous related researches which have been conducted around the world to explore the utility of high resolution products for drought detection but they generally focused on satellite based datasets and less studies have comprehensively assessed the different types of datasets containing gauge based reanalysis based as well as merged products shrestha et al 2017 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 bai et al 2020 brito et al 2020 it is necessary to compare the capabilities of diverse product varieties in drought monitoring since each of them holds their own superiorities due to unique approaches of the data acquirement and disposal though wei et al 2021 compared seventeen satellite reanalysis and gauge based precipitation products for drought monitoring across mainland china the study period was from june 2000 to december 2019 less than 30 years of record which was not enough to support the climate analysis and it also neglected the merged products as well as the effect of evapotranspiration previous studies have assessed the application of high resolution products in drought monitoring usually regarding precipitation as the only factor and they were prone to use drought indexes like spi z score and so on which ignores the effect of evapotranspiration for instance bayissa et al 2017 used z score to evaluate the application of satellite based precipitation datasets in meteorological drought monitoring for the upper blue nile basin in ethiopia zambrano et al 2017 explored the drought monitoring function of satellite derived products in chile based on spi alijanian et al 2019 applied spi to compare the reflection of spatiotemporal drought based on the artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr and multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep products over iran they have not evaluated how the drought index calculations would be affected by considering evapotranspiration despite a few of them took it in account they either selected pdsi inferior to spei as drought index like zhong et al 2018 or merely evaluated one kind of products performance like jiang et al 2021 in addition some of them estimated evapotranspiration only used the traditional penman monteith method such as bai et al 2020 in a plenty of studies assessing the drought monitoring utility of precipitation products the capability of precipitation datasets to reflect the drought characters particularly for drought frequency duration and intensity has hardly been discussed for instance wang et al 2019 conducted the drought evaluation of the climate prediction center morphing technique satellite precipitation data in the yellow river basin based on gridded spei only comparing it with interpolated meteorological station spei xu et al 2019 evaluated the accuracy of mswep v2 1 and its performance for drought monitoring over china by validating its estimate accuracy of spi and comparing it with three typical drought events without discussing their drought characters lai et al 2019 monitored hydrological drought using persiann cdr and climate hazards group infrared chirps precipitation data based on the standardized streamflow index and validated them in grid based xinanjiang hydrological model but it also neglected the comparison of drought characters however it is necessary for precipitation products to correctly diagnose drought characters in drought monitoring since a majority of drought monitoring tools would be adopted in drought evolution analysis to narrow these gaps our research aimed at digging out and comparing the global warming related drought monitoring characters of 7 latest high quality and long term mpes containing persiann cdr chirps the fifth generation the european center for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis for the global climate era5 modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra2 asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources aphrodite global precipitation climatology centre gpcc and mswep combined with the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam etp products based on spei method our main objectives were 1 to assess the precision and applicability of all candidate precipitation products and gleam etp product in china s mainland and its sub regions 2 to investigate the meteorological drought monitoring applicability of 7 mpes combined with gleam etp dataset based on spei in diverse sub regions and timescales and pick out the comprehensively optimal mpes 3 to analyze drought characters drought area ratio frequency duration and intensity detected by optimal mpes together with gleam etp product using multi threshold run theory the results give more valuable references to sort out more suitable products for drought monitoring 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area china s mainland is located on the west shore of the pacific ocean with the typical three ladder landscape due to fluctuations of elevation longitude and altitude the temperature differs a lot in china especially during monsoon season li et al 2018 resulting from the vast discrepancies in topography and climate china is divided to 7 sub regions according to the general climate conditions and elevations yao et al 2020 table 1 fig 1 a 2 2 data collection in this study seven highly used satellite reanalysis gauge based and merged precipitation datasets and gleam evapotranspiration product were selected for meteorological drought monitoring in addition cpap precipitation product and station observed meteorological data contributing to the calculation of etp were utilized as the observation data to coordinate the length of all data records the study period was from january 1983 to december 2015 all datasets without existing monthly scale products are cumulated to the monthly timescale 2 2 1 observation data cpap was selected as the observation precipitation data considering the limitation of data accessibility it has been frequently used as a reference of dataset assessment in china owing to its dense sites and strict quality control of source data bai et al 2020 wei et al 2021 this dataset was a set of grid based precipitation product with a spatial resolution of 0 5 which generated based on approximately 2400 precipitation gauges across the mainland china and thin plate splines method was featured for interpolation shen et al 2010 the spatial distribution of average monthly precipitation from cpap was shown in fig 1b it was available to public and can be download in china meteorological administration http www cma gov cn the observed etp data was estimated by allen s et al 1998 penman monteith equation and related meteorological data mean maximum and minimum air temperature t max and

mean etp 0 in china was exhibited in fig 1d 2 2 2 multi source precipitation estimate products satellite based precipitation products adopted in this study were precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using persiann cdr and chirps datasets persiann cdr precipitation estimate was produced by the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing university of california irvine using persiann algorithm on gridded satellite infrared data b1 in this product the nonlinear regression parameters of the ann model were trained and remained fixed to eliminate the need for passive active microwave observations braithwaite et al 2015 data are available at the website of https www ncei noaa gov products climate data records precipitation persiann chirps was developed for the early warning purpose like seasonal drought monitoring by the u s geological survey and the climate hazard group of the university of california funk et al 2015b it focused on combining models of terrain induced precipitation enhancement with interpolated station data and leveraging new resources of satellite observations precipitation estimates from national aeronautics and space administration nasa and national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa to build high resolution 0 05 0 05 gridded precipitation climatology to remove systematic bias there were already two versions of chirps products and the latest version chirps v2 0 was selected for this study downloaded at https chg geog ucsb edu data chirps for reanalysis based precipitation products era5 and merra2 datasets were selected for the study era5 was the latest version atmospheric reanalysis products produced by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts providing hourly climate data with estimates of uncertainty it combined numerous historical observations into global estimates using state of the art models and data assimilation systems now it has nearly replaced the european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis interim datasets and enhanced in resolution hersbach et al 2020 the datasets could be acquired on the climate data store and the website is https cds climate copernicus eu merra2 was released by nasa s global modeling and assimilation office to supersede the original merra dataset which made a vast improvement in the assimilation system and combined nasa s ozone profile observations it was the first long term global reanalysis to assimilate space based observations of aerosols and represent their interactions with other physical processes in the climate system gelaro et al 2017 the datasets were shared on the nasa website https disc gsfc nasa gov with respect to gauge based precipitation products aphrodite and gpcc datasets were utilized in this study aphrodite products were created based on data collected at 5 000 12 000 stations which represented 2 3 4 5 times the data provided by the global telecommunication system network the aphrodite project has considerably enhanced precipitation depiction performance around the himalayas southeast asia and mountainous regions of the middle east yatagai et al 2012 the aphro v1101 datasets for monsoon asia were prepared for the study it could download at the website of https aphrodite st hirosaki u ac jp download gpcc precipitation datasets were built on about 85 000 observation sites around the world including meteorological observation sites hydrological monitoring sites and sites collected from climate research unit global historical climatology network food and agriculture organization of the united nations data products and some region datasets schneider et al 2020 the spheremap interpolation method was used to obtain the global terrestrial gridded precipitation dataset becker et al 2013 the latest gpcc version 2020 product was collected for the study from https climate data guide ucar edu climate data the merged precipitation product chosen for this study was mswep dataset it was generated by integrating the advantages of gauge satellite and reanalysis based precipitation with specific weights for each grid cell the weights assigned to gauge based estimates were calculated based on the site network density while they assigned to satellite based and reanalysis estimates were determined by their performance comparisons on nearby sites it introduced catchment average precipitation from stream flow observations at 13 762 stations over the globe to correct bias beck et al 2019 the latest version mswep v2 8 dataset was used in this study https www gloh2o org mswep the detail information of spatial and temporal resolution coverage periods and reference of mpes was summarized in table 2 2 2 3 gleam dataset gleam has a set of algorithms that separately estimated the different components of terrestrial evaporation based on the precipitation temperature and other data monitored by satellites gleam products include soil evaporation root zone soil moisture interception loss actual evaporation potential evapotranspiration and other total 10 datasets which could be applied to analyze the temporal and spatial changes of land evapotranspiration drought characteristics and soil moisture characteristics in a large range miralles et al 2010 the potential evapotranspiration dataset was derived from priestley taylor formula based on near surface air temperature and radiation from multiple satellite and reanalysis datasets the latest gleam v3 5a potential evapotranspiration product with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and temporal resolution of month was chosen for this study to estimate the etp devoted to the computation of spei which spanned the 41 year period from january 1980 to december 2020 martens et al 2017 all gleam products are available from the website of https www gleam eu 2 3 computation of spei the computation of multi scalar spei is based on the differences between precipitation and etp namely water deficit d vicente serrano et al 2010 the accumulation of water deficit d is estimated by 3 x i j k l 13 k j 12 d i l 1 l 1 l j d i 1 i f j k x i j k l j k 1 j d i 1 i f j k where x i j k is accumulation of d in the jth month of the ith year at the k month timescale d i l di l is d value in the lth month of the ith year javed et al 2020 wu et al 2020 the three parameter log logistic probability distribution has been proved to be the best distribution for d series by comparing the fitness of six candidate probability density functions in china yao et al 2020 the d is normalized into a three parameter log logistic probability distribution and the spei values are obtained 4 f x 1 α x y β 1 5 p 1 f x 6 w 2 ln p i f p 0 5 2 ln 1 p i f p 0 5 7 spei w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2

drought severity classification refers to table 3 ayantobo et al 2018 2019 the spei at 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 month timescales were computed in the r package spei the cpap and et p 0 based spei is denoted as spei0 hereafter and the seven sets of mpes and gleam based spei time series were denoted as speir speir would be compared to spei0 at the same timescales 2 4 metrics for product evaluation and speir validation to evaluate the performance of mpes as well as gleam etp product and validate the reliability of speir in denoting drought conditions in china s mainland cpap precipitation product et0 and spei0 were used as benchmark five metrics namely coefficient of determination r2 relative bias rb root mean square error rmse the kling gupta efficiency kge and detection rate pod served as evaluation and validation indexes taking the spei as an example five metrics were calculated as follows 8 r 2 i 1 n spei r i spei r spei 0 i spei 0 2 i 1 n spei r i spei r 2 i 1 n spei 0 i spei 0 2 9 rb i 1 n spei r i i 1 n spei 0 i 1 100 10 rmse 1 n i 1 n spei r i spei 0 i 2 11 kge 1 r spe i 0 s p e i r 1 2 spe i r spe i 0 1 2 σ spe i r spei r σ spe i 0 spei 0 1 2 12 pod d 1 1 d 1 1 d 1 0 where n is the length of spei time series speir i and spei0 i are the ith speir and spei0 series spei r and spei 0 are average values of speir and spei0 series r spe i 0 s p e i r is the correlation coefficient of spei0 and speir series σ spe i 0 and σ spe i r are the standard deviation of speir and spei0 series the subscripts 0 and 1 means without and with drought events d 1 1 represents the number of drought events detected by both speir and spei0 series d 1 0 and d 0 1 indicates the number of drought events only detected by spei0 or speir respectively besides speir similar evaluation of the performance for mpes and gleam etp product could be referred to equations 8 to 12 the r2 rb rmse kge and pod values ranged between 0 1 1 1 0 1 and 0 1 respectively the larger the values of r 2 and pod or the smaller the values of rmse and absolute values of rb were the better performance the speir mpes or gleam etp product would show the kge indice could balance the effect of the correlation coefficient and bias and give a comprehensive assessment the more the value of kge is close to 1 the better the products performed when kge value is 0 6 and 0 the results can be respectively considered well and acceptable in our study 2 5 drought event identification the optimized multi thresholds run theory proposed by he et al 2016 was adopted in this study to identify the drought events based on spei this approach removed messy minor drought events and combined strong drought events with short intervals to adequately and reasonably characterize long term patterns of droughts the drought monitoring metric spei was used in the run theory and three thresholds r0 the threshold for pooling adjacent drought events r1 the drought occurrence threshold and r2 the threshold for removing minor drought events for diagnosing drought events were set to 0 5 0 5 and 1 respectively the main steps for drought events identification are as follows in terms of fig 2 1 the value of monthly spei below r1 indicates drought occurrence according to threshold r1 six typical drought events a b c d e and f during the study period would be preliminarily screened 2 after the preliminarily screening in step 1 minor drought events which are only last for 1 month and without reaching the threshold r2 such as event a in the example shown in fig 2 should be removed after that there would be five typical events remained b c d e and f 3 when two drought adjacent events are with an interval of 1 month and without attaining the threshold r0 such as events b and c in fig 2 these two events should be combined into one drought event hence four kinds of drought events b c d e and f are eventually identified 2 6 drought characters statistics drought area ratio annual drought frequency average drought duration and average drought intensity were summarized in this study to exhibit drought characters for each sub region drought area ratio was estimated by counting the number ratio of all drought grids spei 1 and all grids in sub region for each grid according to drought identification results during the study periods based on the run theory annual drought frequency was the times of drought events per year average drought duration and intensity were the mean duration and intensity of all drought events diagnosed during the study period for every drought event the drought duration and intensity were denoted as dt and di respectively and the calculation formula of them were as follows 13 d t t 1 t 0 14 d i i t 0 t 1 spei i d t where t0 and t1 represents the start and end time of drought event speii is the value of spei in the ith month 3 results 3 1 evaluation of mpes and gleam the performance of mpes and gleam etp were assessed over china s mainland using the statistical index r2 rb and kge the spatial distributions of 3 metrics were mapped in fig 3 generally mpes data were close to cpap values in magnitude and spatial variations in most regions r2 0 8 20 rb 20 and kge 0 8 except in qinghai tibetan plateau and northwest desert wherein there were sparse stations arid or semi arid climate and complicate terrain comparing the comprehensive performance of 7 mpes over china s mainland 2 gauge based precipitation products gpcc and aphrodite exhibited higher accuracy than other products the merged precipitation dataset mswep and reanalysis based product merra2 were also in relatively better accordance with cpap the era5 showed the worst performance with obvious overestimations in most regions rb 20 the remaining 2 satellite based precipitation products persiann cdr and chirps performed moderately though they had a worse performance than other products except era5 in qinghai tibetan plateau and northwest desert gleam etp data showed very high correlations with the computed etp 0 data in 90 grids of china s mainland r2 0 8 though relatively large underestimations were found in the western china rb 20 overall gleam etp values had a good agreement with etp 0 in eastern china but relatively worse performance in western china on the basis of the grid cells the assessment index r2 rb and kge values for mpes and gleam etp product in diverse sub regions were displayed in the boxplot fig 4 and the mean of them were also calculated in the table 4 the results showed that 1 in general mpes universally showed a relatively worse performance with a large variation range of r2 rb and kge values and poor average in sub region i and iii compared with other sub regions 2 among of mpes era5 performed worst in all sub regions particularly in sub region i where the average value of rb reached up to 104 8 satellite based persiann cdr and chirps exhibited a relative poor precision than others except era5 chirps with relative low rb values were slightly better than persiann cdr product especially in sub region i reanalysis based merra2 and merged mswep showed the approximate applicability in all sub regions which was better than the datasets mentioned above gauge based gpcc and aphridote demonstrated the optimal performance in all sub regions except i and iii respectively in addition gpcc had a relative lower average kge value 0 47 in sub region iii mainly attributed to interference of local outlier 3 as for gleam etp product the r2 values for all sub regions were very high even in sub region iii average r2 0 85 however the rb values in most sub regions were poor especially in the western china wherein main scope of rb was from 20 to 50 according to the kge values the performance of gleam etp product in eastern china was well with mean kge values higher than 0 6 and in western china was poor but acceptable with kge values less than 0 6 but 0 in sub region iii gleam etp product performed relatively terrible with a kge value nearly close to 0 since there was a comparatively obvious underestimation due to the input data and methods of gleam martens et al 2017 q q plot is useful to visually evaluate the accuracy of estimated products among different quantities to facilitate assessing the performance of the mpes and gleam etp products at low values the log log coordinates for values of the monthly precipitation and etp in 7 sub regions and china s mainland were applied to plot q q graphs in fig 5 for low precipitation values less than 10 mm persiann cdr and gpcc datasets underestimated precipitation in sub regions ii iv vi and vii where the overestimation occurred for other mpes especially chirps and era5 overestimated precipitation more significantly in sub regions except iii and all sub regions respectively for precipitation values within 10 100 mm all mpes except era5 were well consistent with cpap in all sub regions for high precipitation values 100 mm all mpes showed a slight underestimation in sub region i while era5 as well as gpcc exhibited a little overestimation in sub region iii gleam etp product generally underestimated etp 0 for low and mid etp 0 values less than 100 mm in all sub regions particularly in sub region vi and vii while it performed well for high etp 0 100 mm in almost all sub regions in spite of a little underestimation occurring in sub region i ii and iii since the input of net radiation was negative in winter and the related data in gleam mainly came from satellite monitoring there was a negative deviation of low intensity etp r in high humid regions overall the accuracy of mpes and gleam could generally guarantee reliability in china s mainland especially in eastern sub regions 3 2 comparison of speir and spei0 the drought monitoring utility of mpes combined with gleam etp product could be assessed by comparing speir values with spei0 spatial distributions of r2 rmse and pod values of speir versus spei0 at 1 month timescale were mapped in fig 6 and the mean values of them for 7 sub regions and china s mainland were also computed in table 5 the results demonstrated that 1 all mpes had higher performance in eastern china wetter but lower in western china drier 2 the spatial difference of r 2 was more obvious in china than that of rmse and pod especially in western regions 3 there was a generally increasing area of larger r2 pod and smaller rmse blue regions corresponding to products of persiann cdr chirps era5 mswep merra2 aphrodite and gpcc which indicated that the speir values calculated based on gpcc precipitation combined with gleam etp products agreed the best with spei0 the spatial distribution of the r2 rmse and pod values at the 3 6 9 12 and 24 month timescales were generally similar with that of 1 month timescale and would not be described in details for each sub region and china s mainland frequency confusion matrices of the drought classification for 1 month speir versus spei0 from january 1983 to december 2015 were drawn in fig 7 to assess the drought classification performance of mpes in terms of the table 3 the depths of colored matrices indicated the frequencies of months in diverse drought levels overall all mpes performed worse in sub regions i ii and iii wherein they frequently underestimated the drought severity than other regions gauge based gpcc and aphridote as well as merged mswep showed top three accuracy of dividing drought conditions in turn in most sub regions satellite based persiann cdr and chirps tended to underrate the moderate drought 1 5 spei 1 in all sub regions especially for chirps reanalysis based era5 and merra2 always overestimated the severe drought 2 spei 1 5 in sub regions vi v and vi to evaluate the performance of mpes in computing speir at different timescales two metrics r2 rmse of speir versus spei0 at the 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 month timescales in 7 sub regions and china s mainland were illustrated in fig 8 in addition the pod index was also demonstrated in figure s 6 the bars with various colors and textures respectively represented diverse mpes whose length characterized the values size the results explained that the drought monitoring performance of mpes was susceptible to timescales the precision of speir and ability of drought events detection dropped as the expanding timescale particularly obvious for merra2 especially in sub region vi and vii and secondly evident for aphrodite and era5 but slightly affected for gpcc mswep persiann cdr and chirps in sub region i and iii the performance of most mpes were more sensitive to the timescale but era5 was very stable in general gauge based gpcc merged product mswep reanalysis based era5 and satellite based persiann cdr were almost unaffected by timescale in all sub regions 3 3 historical drought cases study for optimal mpes according to the results of section 3 1 and 3 2 gpcc product was the comprehensively optimal choice for drought monitoring to further validate the drought monitoring ability of gpcc product in reflecting the spatial and temporal performance referring to typically historical drought events the study selected two typical drought affected regions based on zhong et al 2018 bai et al 2020 and wei et al 2021 for historically typical drought events study there were continuous drought events in huang huai hai plain and southwest china respectively during 1999 2000 and 2009 2010 wherein the drought was most severe in may 2000 and march 2010 in turn wei et al 2004 barriopedro et al 2012 the temporal fluctuation of 12 month spei and drought area ratio spei12 1 based on cpap and gpcc compared with historical drought events shown as red bars in huang huai hai plain and southwest china was displayed in the fig 9 the results demonstrated that 1 there was a well consistency in temporal variations of spei calculated by cpap and gpcc whether in huang huai hai plain or southwest china with r2 0 9 and rmse around 0 2 2 temporal changes of drought area ratio estimated by gpcc showed a high agreement with it estimated by cpap also in both two areas with r2 0 9 and rmse 0 1 3 both spei and drought area ratio estimated by gpcc successfully captured the drought events occurred in huang huai hai plain and southwest china respectively in may 2000 and march 2010 therefore gpcc product can monitor drought temporal changes and capture drought events well to further compared the spatial variation characters of spei based on gpcc and cpap spatial distributions of 12 month spei based on gpcc and cpap in specific months in two typically historical drought regions were exhibited in fig 10 the results indicated that 1 gpcc product could roughly capture the spatial core and range of two drought events though there were still some differences in drought classification 2 the spei based on gpcc demonstrated a brilliant spatial consistency with spei0 in huang huai hai plain with r2 0 8 and rmse 0 4 table 6 though the spatial performance of spei based on gpcc in southwest china wasn t as excellent as it in huang huai hai plain it was still well with r2 0 6 and rmse 0 5 table 6 3 the spei based on gpcc could accurately detect the occurrence of most drought events with pod 0 8 in both two areas table 6 in summary gpcc product performed well in reflecting the spatial distribution of drought monitoring 3 4 drought characteristics based on optimal mpes gpcc product was selected as the optimal mpes for drought monitoring relying on above results and would be used to analyze drought characteristics in 7 sub regions and china s mainland the drought area ratio annual drought frequency as well as average drought duration and intensity based on the spei estimated by gpcc were summarized to reflect the drought characteristics in 7 sub regions and china s mainland and the 12 month spei were selected for annual study the temporal variations of drought area ratio spei12 1 based on gpcc product in 7 sub regions during january1983 december 2015 were drawn in fig 11 the min average and max values of drought area ratio in 7 sub regions were summarized in table 7 the results showed that 1 the variations of drought area ratio implied an increasing trend in sub regions vi and vii fig 11 2 there were more periods with the occurrence of high drought area ratio 0 5 in sub regions i ii iv and v fig 11 3 although the mean values of the drought area ratio in all sub regions were close to each other around 0 17 there were higher max values of the drought area ratio in sub regions i ii iv and v table 7 overall drought in southeastern china had an increasing trend and there was a high tendency for widespread drought in northern china the spatial distribution of average annual drought frequency duration and intensity estimated by 12 month spei based on gpcc product during january 1983 december 2015 over china s mainland were shown in fig 12 and statistics were listed in table 7 the results explained that 1 average annual drought frequency was higher in northern china than it in southern china fig 12 a the values of it based on grids were range from 0 18 to 0 64 and averaged around 0 35 times per year in china its min average and max values in sub regions v vi and vii were relatively higher than other regions 2 on the contrary average drought duration was longer in northern china than it in southern china fig 12 b and its min average and values in sub region i ii iii and iv were higher than other areas table 7 the range and mean value of average drought duration were respectively 5 43 33 5 and 11 36 months in china table 7 3 average drought intensity values were more than 1 26 and less than 0 76 their mean values in 7 sub regions were very close and around 1 in summary the drought events in northern china were usually with lower frequency longer duration and similar intensity than them in southern china 4 discussions 4 1 the discrepancy of precipitation products the precipitation products derived from various sources and disposed in diverse algorithms were distinguished in their accuracy and thus will affect their drought monitoring performance trenberth et al 2014 beck et al 2017 sun et al 2018 explained that satellite based and gauged based products were more adept in catching spatial as well as temporal characteristics respectively and the reanalysis based products have a moderate spatial and temporal depiction performance compared with those two similar conclusions were also reached in this study and it was found that the drought monitoring performance of precipitation datasets depended on their types as well in addition different precipitation products had unique spatial and temporal resolution as well as the range and length of time series ma et al 2021 wei et al 2021 for instance satellite based precipitation datasets were usually with high spatiotemporal resolution and wide coverage but short length of time series due to its late development though gauge based precipitation products were universally with high accuracy table 4 their spatial coverage and resolution would be limited due to the displacement and number of in situ stations schneider et al 2020 yatagai et al 2012 nevertheless not all of precipitation particularly for those with limited data length less than 30 years were adapted for drought monitoring especially for the computation of drought indexes like spi and spei since at least 30 years of data records were compulsorily required in climatic studies giles 2005 lai et al 2019 in addition datasets have been constantly updated funk et al 2015a huffman et al 2019 hersbach et al 2020 the relatively older ones had either obviously coarse resolution or good substitutes xie et al 2003 uppala et al 2005 ma et al 2021 overall all of factors mentioned above would affect the applicability of precipitation products for drought monitoring not absolutely depending on their accuracy compared to observed precipitation 4 2 the regionality of mpes for drought monitoring drought monitoring performance of mpes was region specific owing to the unique weather geographical environment in diverse sub regions in arid and semi arid areas sub regions i ii and iii all mpes performed relatively poor their performance was especially worst for arid sub region i with dryer climate and secondly worst for semi arid sub region iii with special terrains and few in situ stations jiang et al 2021 among of mpes satellite based products persiann cdr and chirps performed worst with r2 rmse and pod around 0 3 0 9 and 0 4 in table 5 due to multiple influences such as algorithm defect aerosol and insufficient error correction datasets kim et al 2017 ma et al 2021 gauge based products gpcc and aphrodite showed best performance than other mpes with r2 rmse and pod around 0 4 0 8 and 0 5 in table 5 though they were also affected by finite number of in situ stations and compared to aphrodite whose performance obviously dropped with expanding timescales gpcc was more stable whose applicability was hardly affected by time scales fig 8 and s 6 in addition although reanalysis based product merra2 slightly outperformed than merged product mswep according to metrics in table 5 merra2 was more susceptible to timescales and mswep was more suitable for large timescales drought monitoring fig 8 and s 6 in semi humid and humid areas sub regions iv v vi and vii all mpes exhibited a higher drought monitoring utility most of them performed relatively better in humid sub regions vi and vii than in semi humid sub regions iv and v table 5 gauge based products gpcc and aphrodite held the optimal applicability of drought monitoring both in humid and semi humid regions since their datasets derived from observed stations which were abundant in these areas schneider et al 2020 yatagai et al 2012 as for the influence of timescales the gpcc dataset was still very stable but aphrodite product was more sensitive fig 8 and s 6 satellite based products chirps and persiann cdr performed worst respectively in semi humid and humid sub regions their drought monitoring performance was still reduced by increasing timescales fig 8 and s 6 contrary to results in arid regions merged product mswep surpassed reanalysis based product merra2 in humid and semi humid regions mswep product was also more stable to timescales than merra2 overall gpcc product was more recommended for drought monitoring in all sub regions for various timescales 4 3 evapotranspiration for drought monitoring evapotranspiration was a critical element for inducing drought and intensifying drought severity verified by numerous studies sheffield et al 2012 dai 2013 otkin et al 2016 since as the trigger of drought water shortage not only relies on the water input like precipitation but also crucially depends on the potential evapotranspiration which receives water from terrestrial water stores affecting water availability on land surfaces and could further enhance vegetation water stress under low soil moisture zampieri et al 2009 vicente serrano et al 2018 the methods for the estimation of evapotranspiration were various though penman monteith was an accurate and traditional method for the estimation of evapotranspiration frequently used in most drought monitoring studies zhong et al 2018 jiang et al 2021 there were also some limitations for it particular in the availability coverage and resolution of data materials needed recently there were numerous evapotranspiration products available such as the north american land data assimilation system nldas simplified surface energy balance operational ssebop the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis i e mod16 and gleam etc martens et al 2017 among of them the satellite derived gleam evapotranspiration products were quite suitable for the estimation of evapotranspiration applied in drought monitoring which comprehensively had better accuracy longer time series wider coverage and higher resolution than other evapotranspiration products miralles et al 2016 martens et al 2017 vicente serrano et al 2018 nevertheless there were still some non negligible errors in gleam products which were more obvious in the western china there still uncertainties in the drought monitoring performance based on gleam and mpes due to the offsetability of errors from them and our results showed that the drought monitoring performance of mpes combined with gleam etp was differed with the accuracy of itself 4 4 the diagnosis of drought characteristics the drought characteristics analysis was one of the significant destinations of drought monitoring xu et al 2015 he et al 2016 and whether data used for drought monitoring could reflect the drought characters correctly was essential the selection of drought event diagnosis methods may affect the results of drought detection traditional approach adopted to detect drought events was usually based on one threshold which may not fully capture the characteristics of long term drought to make up for this deficiency he et al 2016 proposed multi threshold run theory which could avoid a long lasting drought events being divided into a number of minor droughts by a short wet events and more reasonable for drought events diagnosis this study utilized multi threshold run theory to diagnose drought events and analyzed drought characters reflected by mpes combined with gleam etp based on spei and results indicated that not all mpes with high performance of spei estimation accuracy and historical drought events detection could also capture the drought characters well above all there were also some limitations for the study since the density of stations affect the accuracy of precipitation datasets satgé et al 2020 tang et al 2020 the validation in western china should be conducted in various methods in addition drought characters and precipitation products performance were season dependent xu et al 2015 darand et al 2017 the drought monitoring performance of all precipitation products for diverse season was worth to discuss in detail though gleam products were with obvious errors in western china the correlation between it and evapotranspiration calculated by penman monteith equation were pretty high which indicated a great potential for gleam to estimate evapotranspiration more accurately 5 conclusions this study evaluated the drought monitoring performance of 7 mpes containing satellite persiann cdr and chirps reanalysis era5 and merra2 gauge aphrodite and gpcc based and merged mswep precipitation products combined with gleam etp dataset based on spei in 7 sub regions over china s mainland from january 1983 and december 2015 the spei calculated by cpap precipitation product and etp estimated by penman monteith equation and related meteorological data were regard as an observed reference main conclusions were summarized as follows 1 all monthly mpes performed better in eastern china and worse in western china among of mpes the accuracy could be divided into 4 levels from high to low first to fourth levels were gpcc and aphrodite merra2 and mswep chirps and persiann cdr as well as era5 in turn the performance of gleam etp product was well in southern china but poor in northwest desert inner mongolia grassland area and qinghai tibet plateau due to a relatively larger underestimation 2 the drought monitoring applicability of all mpes was regional specific low in parts of northwest desert and qinghai tibet plateau and high in other sub regions it was also susceptible to the timescales of spei and dropped as the expanding timescale among of mpes gpcc product performed comprehensively best than others in drought monitoring in china it was also able to capture the temporal and spatial variation of drought events well 3 in northern china drought events usually have large area ratio longer duration and lower frequency however these characteristics in southern china performed opposite to it in addition the drought in eastern china had an increasing trend in general gauge based precipitation datasets ultimately were the optimal selection for drought monitoring based on spei combined with gleam etp data in the case of ignoring the limitation of spatial and temporal resolution periods and coverage especially for gpcc product these results may give some pertinent suggestions for the selection of data in globe warming related drought study particularly in

2543,with the accelerated climate change the selection of globe warming related drought monitoring tools is vitally significant to select the most suitable multi source precipitation product for drought monitoring this study comprehensively evaluated the performance of 7 latest version of multi source precipitation estimate products mpes including persiann cdr chirps era5 merra2 aphrodite gpcc and mswep and compared their drought monitoring applicability combined with gleam potential evapotranspiration etp product based on the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei during 1983 2015 over china the spei estimated by the china monthly precipitation analysis product cpap was used as the reference to assess their performance in addition the drought area ratio frequency duration and intensity were analyzed based on the multi threshold run theory the results showed that 1 the precision of mpes was higher in eastern china but lower in western china and the overall accuracy of mpes summarized as 4 levels from top to end respectively was gpcc and aphrodite merra2 and mswep chirps and persiann cdr as well as era5 gleam etp performed well in eastern china but poor in western china with large underestimations 2 the applicability of mpes in drought monitoring was regional specific low in parts of northwest desert and qinghai tibet plateau but high in other areas the accuracy of estimated spei for most mpes dropped with expanding timescale in most sub regions among of mpes gpcc product comprehensively performed best in drought monitoring 3 drought events occurring in northern china were usually with larger area ratio lower frequency and longer duration than other regions drought events had an exacerbating trend in southeastern china overall

drought is one of the most universal and destructive natural hazards which can impose considerable adverse impacts on economic growth agricultural production social stability and even human survival wang et al 2018 lai et al 2019 heydari alamdarloo et al 2020 in recent years climate change and human activities have been exacerbating the frequency intensity duration and spatial extent of drought disasters cook et al 2014 trenberth et al 2014 wang et al 2018 china with its sophisticated climatic conditions large population fragile ecosystem and soaring economy is sensitive to climate change and drought disasters ju et al 2013 wu et al 2020 bai et al 2021 to guard against and mitigate drought caused damage it is of a huge significance for china to monitor and track the evolution of drought characters more accurately especially for spatial pattern bayissa et al 2015 bayissa et al 2017 li et al 2020 drought is commonly classified as four categories meteorological agricultural hydrologic and socio economic drought in accordance with their hydrological cycle process society 1997 wu et al 2016 the meteorological drought is the most predominant one which is a crucial natural trigger of the other three kinds of drought nasrollahi et al 2018 west et al 2019 alamdarloo et al 2021 the meteorological drought monitoring mainly depends on drought indices which contain the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1968 the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 the effective drought index edi byun and wilhite 1999 the z index yao et al 2007 and spei vicente serrano et al 2010 etc among of these spei was proposed by incorporating etp estimates into the structure of spi estimates of etp were closely related to the temperature variability which can be affected by global warming continuous global warming also contributes considerably to the occurrence and intensity of drought by enhancing evapotranspiration kim and rhee 2016 thus spei with a relatively brief calculation flexible scales and the consideration of the effect of global warming has been the first choice for drought monitoring wang et al 2017a zhang et al 2018 bai et al 2020 however traditional spei index is commonly computed in site scale since its key components are mainly derived from meteorological stations whose placement is seriously limited by geographic and economic elements ma et al 2021 it is too vulnerable to sufficiently reflect large scale dynamic drought information wang et al 2019 although spatial interpolation can compensate for this it still introduces non negligible errors wang et al 2017b nowadays an increasing number of high resolution multi source meteorological products have been available particularly for evapotranspiration and precipitation liu et al 2019 ma et al 2021 and it is possible for them to be applied in the calculation of spei recently there were numerous related researches which have been conducted around the world to explore the utility of high resolution products for drought detection but they generally focused on satellite based datasets and less studies have comprehensively assessed the different types of datasets containing gauge based reanalysis based as well as merged products shrestha et al 2017 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 bai et al 2020 brito et al 2020 it is necessary to compare the capabilities of diverse product varieties in drought monitoring since each of them holds their own superiorities due to unique approaches of the data acquirement and disposal though wei et al 2021 compared seventeen satellite reanalysis and gauge based precipitation products for drought monitoring across mainland china the study period was from june 2000 to december 2019 less than 30 years of record which was not enough to support the climate analysis and it also neglected the merged products as well as the effect of evapotranspiration previous studies have assessed the application of high resolution products in drought monitoring usually regarding precipitation as the only factor and they were prone to use drought indexes like spi z score and so on which ignores the effect of evapotranspiration for instance bayissa et al 2017 used z score to evaluate the application of satellite based precipitation datasets in meteorological drought monitoring for the upper blue nile basin in ethiopia zambrano et al 2017 explored the drought monitoring function of satellite derived products in chile based on spi alijanian et al 2019 applied spi to compare the reflection of spatiotemporal drought based on the artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr and multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep products over iran they have not evaluated how the drought index calculations would be affected by considering evapotranspiration despite a few of them took it in account they either selected pdsi inferior to spei as drought index like zhong et al 2018 or merely evaluated one kind of products performance like jiang et al 2021 in addition some of them estimated evapotranspiration only used the traditional penman monteith method such as bai et al 2020 in a plenty of studies assessing the drought monitoring utility of precipitation products the capability of precipitation datasets to reflect the drought characters particularly for drought frequency duration and intensity has hardly been discussed for instance wang et al 2019 conducted the drought evaluation of the climate prediction center morphing technique satellite precipitation data in the yellow river basin based on gridded spei only comparing it with interpolated meteorological station spei xu et al 2019 evaluated the accuracy of mswep v2 1 and its performance for drought monitoring over china by validating its estimate accuracy of spi and comparing it with three typical drought events without discussing their drought characters lai et al 2019 monitored hydrological drought using persiann cdr and climate hazards group infrared chirps precipitation data based on the standardized streamflow index and validated them in grid based xinanjiang hydrological model but it also neglected the comparison of drought characters however it is necessary for precipitation products to correctly diagnose drought characters in drought monitoring since a majority of drought monitoring tools would be adopted in drought evolution analysis to narrow these gaps our research aimed at digging out and comparing the global warming related drought monitoring characters of 7

retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra2 asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources aphrodite global precipitation climatology centre gpcc and mswep combined with the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam etp products based on spei method our main objectives were 1 to assess the precision and applicability of all candidate precipitation products and gleam etp product in china s mainland and its sub regions 2 to investigate the meteorological drought monitoring applicability of 7 mpes combined with gleam etp dataset based on spei in diverse sub regions and timescales and pick out the comprehensively optimal mpes 3 to analyze drought characters drought area ratio frequency duration and intensity detected by optimal mpes together with gleam etp product using multi threshold run theory the results give more valuable references to sort out more suitable products for drought monitoring 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area china s mainland is located on the west shore of the pacific ocean with the typical three ladder landscape due to fluctuations of elevation longitude and altitude the temperature differs a lot in china especially during monsoon season li et al 2018 resulting from the vast discrepancies in topography and climate china is divided to 7 sub regions according to the general climate conditions and elevations yao et al 2020 table 1 fig 1 a 2 2 data collection in this study seven highly used satellite reanalysis gauge based and merged precipitation datasets and gleam evapotranspiration product were selected for meteorological drought monitoring in addition cpap precipitation product and station observed meteorological data contributing to the calculation of etp were utilized as the observation data to coordinate the length of all data records the study period was from january 1983 to december 2015 all datasets without existing monthly scale products are cumulated to the monthly timescale 2 2 1 observation data cpap was selected as the observation precipitation data considering the limitation of data accessibility it has been frequently used as a reference of dataset assessment in china owing to its dense sites and strict quality control of source data bai et al 2020 wei et al 2021 this dataset was a set of grid based precipitation product with a spatial resolution of 0 5 which generated based on approximately 2400 precipitation gauges across the mainland china and thin plate splines method was featured for interpolation shen et al 2010 the spatial distribution of average monthly precipitation from cpap was shown in fig 1b it was available to public and can be download in china meteorological

mean etp 0 in china was exhibited in fig 1d 2 2 2 multi source precipitation estimate products satellite based precipitation products adopted in this study were precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using persiann cdr and chirps datasets persiann cdr precipitation estimate was produced by the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing university of california irvine using persiann algorithm on gridded satellite infrared data b1 in this product the nonlinear regression parameters of the ann model were trained and remained fixed to eliminate the need for passive active microwave observations braithwaite et al 2015 data are available at the website of https www ncei noaa gov products climate data records precipitation persiann chirps was developed for the early warning purpose like seasonal drought monitoring by the u s geological survey and the climate hazard group of the university of california funk et al 2015b it focused on combining models of terrain induced precipitation enhancement with interpolated station data and leveraging new resources of satellite observations precipitation estimates from national aeronautics and space administration nasa and national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa to build high resolution 0 05 0 05 gridded precipitation climatology to remove systematic bias there were already two versions of chirps

was mswep dataset it was generated by integrating the advantages of gauge satellite and reanalysis based precipitation with specific weights for each grid cell the weights assigned to gauge based estimates were calculated based on the site network density while they assigned to satellite based and reanalysis estimates were determined by their performance comparisons on nearby sites it introduced catchment average precipitation from stream flow observations at 13 762 stations over the globe to correct bias beck et al 2019 the latest version mswep v2 8 dataset was used in this study https www gloh2o org mswep the detail information of spatial and temporal resolution coverage periods and reference of mpes was summarized in table 2 2 2 3 gleam dataset gleam has a set of algorithms that separately estimated the different components of terrestrial evaporation based on the precipitation temperature and other data monitored by satellites gleam products include soil evaporation root zone soil moisture interception loss actual evaporation potential evapotranspiration and other total 10 datasets which could be applied to analyze the temporal and spatial changes of land evapotranspiration drought characteristics and soil moisture characteristics in a large range miralles et al 2010 the potential evapotranspiration dataset was derived from priestley taylor formula based on near surface air temperature and radiation from multiple satellite and reanalysis datasets the latest gleam v3 5a potential evapotranspiration product with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and temporal resolution of month was chosen for this study to estimate the etp devoted to the computation of spei which spanned the 41 year period from january 1980 to december 2020 martens et al 2017 all gleam products are available from the website of https www gleam eu 2 3 computation of spei the computation of multi scalar spei is based on the differences between precipitation and etp namely water deficit d vicente serrano et al 2010 the accumulation of water deficit d is estimated by 3 x i j k l 13 k j 12 d i l 1 l 1 l j d i 1 i f j k x i j k l j k 1 j d i 1 i f j k where x i j k is accumulation of d in the jth month of the ith year at the k month timescale d i l di l is d value in the lth month of the ith year javed et al 2020 wu et al 2020 the three parameter log logistic probability distribution has been proved to be the best distribution for d series by comparing the fitness of six candidate probability density functions in china yao et al 2020 the d is normalized into a three parameter log logistic probability distribution and the spei values are obtained 4 f x 1 α x y β 1 5 p 1 f x 6 w 2 ln p i f p 0 5 2 ln 1 p i f p 0 5 7 spei w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2

drought severity classification refers to table 3 ayantobo et al 2018 2019 the spei at 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 month timescales were computed in the r package spei the cpap and et p 0 based spei is denoted as spei0 hereafter and the seven sets of mpes and gleam based spei time series were denoted as speir speir would be compared to spei0 at the same timescales 2 4 metrics for product evaluation and speir validation to evaluate the performance of mpes as well as gleam etp product and validate the reliability of speir in denoting drought conditions in china s mainland cpap precipitation product et0 and spei0 were used as benchmark five metrics namely coefficient of determination r2 relative bias rb root mean square error rmse the kling gupta efficiency kge and detection rate pod served as evaluation and validation indexes taking the spei as an example five metrics were calculated as follows 8 r 2 i 1 n spei r i spei r spei 0 i spei 0 2 i 1 n spei r i spei r 2 i 1 n spei 0 i spei 0 2 9

coefficient of spei0 and speir series σ spe i 0 and σ spe i r are the standard deviation of speir and spei0 series the subscripts 0 and 1 means without and with drought events d 1 1 represents the number of drought events detected by both speir and spei0 series d 1 0 and d 0 1 indicates the number of drought events only detected by spei0 or speir respectively besides speir similar evaluation of the performance for mpes and gleam etp product could be referred to equations 8 to 12 the r2 rb rmse kge and pod values ranged between 0 1 1 1 0 1 and 0 1 respectively the larger the values of r 2 and pod or the smaller the values of rmse and absolute values of rb were the better performance the speir mpes or gleam etp product would show the kge indice could balance the effect of the correlation coefficient and bias and give a comprehensive assessment the more the value of kge is close to 1 the better the products performed when kge value is 0 6 and 0 the results can be respectively considered well and acceptable in our study 2 5 drought event identification the optimized multi thresholds run theory proposed by he et al 2016 was adopted in this study to identify the drought events based on spei this approach removed messy minor drought events and combined strong drought events with short intervals to adequately and reasonably characterize long term patterns of droughts the drought monitoring metric spei was used in the run theory and three thresholds r0 the threshold for pooling adjacent drought events r1 the drought occurrence threshold and r2 the threshold for removing minor drought events for diagnosing drought events were set to 0 5 0 5 and 1 respectively the main steps for drought events identification are as follows in terms of fig 2 1 the value of monthly spei below r1 indicates drought occurrence according to threshold r1 six typical drought events a b c d e and f during the study period would be preliminarily screened 2 after the preliminarily screening in step 1 minor drought events which are only last for 1 month and without reaching the threshold r2 such as event a in the example shown in fig 2 should be removed after that there would be five typical events remained b c d e and f 3 when two drought adjacent events are with an interval of 1 month and without attaining the threshold r0 such as events b and c in fig 2 these two events should be combined into one drought event hence four kinds of drought events b c d e and f are eventually identified 2 6 drought characters statistics drought area ratio annual drought frequency average drought duration and average drought intensity were summarized in this study to exhibit drought characters for each sub region drought area ratio was estimated by counting the number ratio of all drought grids spei 1 and all grids in sub region for each grid according to drought identification results during the study periods based on the run theory annual drought frequency was the times of drought events per year average drought duration and intensity were the mean duration and intensity of all drought events diagnosed during the study period for every drought event the drought duration and intensity were denoted as dt and di respectively and the calculation formula of them were as follows 13 d t t 1 t 0 14 d i i t 0 t 1 spei i d t where t0 and t1 represents the start and end time of drought event speii is the value of spei in the ith month 3 results 3 1 evaluation of mpes and gleam the performance of mpes and gleam etp were assessed over china s mainland using the statistical index r2 rb and kge the spatial distributions of 3 metrics were mapped in fig 3 generally mpes data were close to cpap values in magnitude and spatial variations in most regions r2 0 8 20 rb 20 and kge 0 8 except in qinghai tibetan plateau and northwest desert wherein there were sparse stations arid or semi arid climate and complicate terrain comparing the comprehensive performance of 7 mpes over china s mainland 2 gauge based precipitation products gpcc and aphrodite exhibited higher accuracy than other products the merged precipitation dataset mswep and reanalysis based product merra2 were also in relatively better accordance with cpap the era5 showed the worst performance with obvious overestimations in most regions rb 20 the remaining 2 satellite based precipitation products persiann cdr and chirps performed moderately though they had a worse performance than other products except era5 in qinghai tibetan plateau and northwest desert gleam etp data showed very high correlations with the computed etp 0 data in 90 grids of china s mainland r2 0 8 though relatively large underestimations were found in the western china rb 20 overall gleam etp values had a good agreement with etp 0 in eastern china but relatively worse performance in western china on the basis of the grid cells the assessment index r2 rb and kge values for mpes and gleam etp product in diverse sub regions were displayed in the boxplot fig 4 and the mean of them were also calculated in the table 4 the results showed that 1 in general mpes universally showed a relatively worse performance with a large variation range of r2 rb and kge values and poor average in sub region i and iii compared with other sub regions 2 among of mpes era5 performed worst in all sub regions particularly in sub region i where the average value of rb reached up to 104 8 satellite based persiann cdr and chirps exhibited a relative poor precision than others except era5 chirps with relative low rb values were slightly better than persiann cdr product especially in sub region i reanalysis based merra2 and merged mswep showed the approximate applicability in all sub regions which was better than the datasets mentioned above gauge based gpcc and aphridote demonstrated the optimal performance in all sub regions except i and iii respectively in addition gpcc had a relative lower average kge value 0 47 in sub region iii mainly attributed to interference of local outlier 3 as for gleam etp product the r2 values for all sub regions were very high even in sub region iii average r2 0 85 however the rb values in most sub regions were poor especially in the western china wherein main scope of rb was from 20 to 50 according to the kge values the performance of gleam etp product in eastern china was well with mean kge values higher than 0 6 and in western china was poor but acceptable with kge values less than 0 6 but 0 in sub region iii gleam etp product performed relatively terrible with a kge value nearly close to 0 since there was a comparatively obvious underestimation due to the input data and methods of gleam martens et al 2017 q q plot is useful to visually evaluate the accuracy of estimated products among different quantities to facilitate assessing the performance of the mpes and gleam etp products at low values the log log coordinates for values of the monthly precipitation and etp in 7 sub regions and china s mainland were applied to plot q q graphs in fig 5 for low precipitation values less than 10 mm persiann cdr and gpcc datasets underestimated precipitation in sub regions ii iv vi and vii where the overestimation occurred for other mpes especially chirps and era5 overestimated precipitation more significantly in sub regions except iii and all sub regions respectively for precipitation values within 10 100 mm all mpes except era5 were well consistent with cpap in all sub regions for high precipitation values 100 mm all mpes showed a slight underestimation in sub region i while era5 as well as gpcc exhibited a little overestimation in sub region iii gleam etp product generally underestimated etp 0 for low and mid etp 0 values less than 100 mm in all sub regions particularly in sub region vi and vii while it performed well for high etp 0 100 mm in almost all sub regions in spite of a little underestimation occurring in sub region i ii and iii since the input of net radiation was negative in winter and the related data in gleam mainly came from satellite monitoring there was a negative deviation of low intensity etp r in high humid regions overall the accuracy of mpes and gleam could generally guarantee reliability in china s mainland especially in eastern sub regions 3 2 comparison of speir and spei0 the drought monitoring utility of mpes combined with gleam etp product could be assessed by comparing speir values with spei0 spatial distributions of r2 rmse and pod values of speir versus spei0 at 1 month timescale were mapped in fig 6 and the mean values of them for 7 sub regions and china s mainland were also computed in table 5 the results demonstrated that 1 all mpes had higher performance in eastern china wetter but lower in western china drier 2 the spatial difference of r 2 was more obvious in china than that of rmse and pod especially in western regions 3 there was a generally increasing area of larger r2 pod and smaller rmse blue regions corresponding to products of persiann cdr chirps era5 mswep merra2 aphrodite and gpcc which indicated that the speir values calculated based on gpcc precipitation combined with gleam etp products agreed the best with spei0 the spatial distribution of the r2 rmse and pod values at the 3 6 9 12 and 24 month timescales were generally similar with that of 1 month timescale and would not be described in details for each sub region and china s mainland frequency confusion matrices of the drought classification for 1 month speir versus spei0 from january 1983 to december 2015 were drawn in fig 7 to assess the drought classification performance of mpes in terms of the table 3 the depths of colored matrices indicated the frequencies of months in diverse drought levels overall all mpes performed worse in sub regions i ii and iii wherein they frequently underestimated the drought severity than other regions gauge based gpcc and aphridote as well as merged mswep showed top three accuracy of dividing drought conditions in turn in most sub regions satellite based persiann cdr and chirps tended to underrate the moderate drought 1 5 spei 1 in all sub regions especially for chirps reanalysis based era5 and merra2 always overestimated the severe drought 2 spei 1 5 in sub regions vi v and vi to evaluate the performance of mpes in computing speir at different timescales two metrics r2 rmse of speir versus spei0 at the 1 3 6 9 12 and 24 month timescales in 7 sub regions and china s mainland were illustrated in fig 8 in addition the pod index was also demonstrated in figure s 6 the bars with various colors and textures respectively represented diverse mpes whose length characterized the values size the results explained that the drought monitoring performance of mpes was susceptible to timescales the precision of speir and ability of drought events detection dropped as the expanding timescale particularly obvious for merra2 especially in sub region vi and vii and secondly evident for aphrodite and era5 but slightly affected for gpcc mswep persiann cdr and chirps in sub region i and iii the performance of most mpes were more sensitive to the timescale but era5 was very stable in general gauge based gpcc merged product mswep reanalysis based era5 and satellite based persiann cdr were almost unaffected by timescale in all sub regions 3 3 historical drought cases study for optimal mpes according to the results of section 3 1 and 3 2 gpcc product was the comprehensively optimal choice for drought monitoring to further validate the drought monitoring ability of gpcc product in reflecting the spatial and temporal performance referring to typically historical drought events the study selected two typical drought affected regions based on zhong et al 2018 bai et al 2020 and wei et al 2021 for historically typical drought events study there were continuous drought events in huang huai hai plain and southwest china respectively during 1999 2000 and 2009 2010 wherein the drought was most severe in may 2000 and march 2010 in turn wei et al 2004 barriopedro et al 2012 the temporal fluctuation of 12 month spei and drought area ratio spei12 1 based on cpap and gpcc compared with historical drought events shown as red bars in huang huai hai plain and southwest china was displayed in the fig 9 the results demonstrated that 1 there was a well consistency in temporal variations of spei calculated by cpap and gpcc whether in huang huai hai plain or southwest china with r2 0 9 and rmse around 0 2 2 temporal changes of drought area ratio estimated by gpcc showed a high agreement with it estimated by cpap also in both two areas with r2 0 9 and rmse 0 1 3 both spei and drought area ratio estimated by gpcc successfully captured the drought events occurred in huang huai hai plain and southwest china respectively in may 2000 and march 2010 therefore gpcc product can monitor drought temporal changes and capture drought events well to further compared the spatial variation characters of spei based on gpcc and cpap spatial distributions of 12 month spei based on gpcc and cpap in specific months in two typically historical drought regions were exhibited in fig 10 the results indicated that 1 gpcc product could roughly capture the spatial core and range of two drought events though there were still some differences in drought classification 2 the spei based on gpcc demonstrated a brilliant spatial consistency with spei0 in huang huai hai plain with r2 0 8 and rmse 0 4 table 6 though the spatial performance of spei based on gpcc in southwest china wasn t as excellent as it in huang huai hai plain it was still well with r2 0 6 and rmse 0 5 table 6 3 the spei based on gpcc could accurately detect the occurrence of most drought events with pod 0 8 in both two areas table 6 in summary gpcc product performed well in reflecting the spatial distribution of drought monitoring 3 4 drought characteristics based on optimal mpes gpcc product was selected as the optimal mpes for drought monitoring relying on above results and would be used to analyze drought characteristics in 7 sub regions and china s mainland the drought area ratio annual drought frequency as well as average drought duration and intensity based on the spei estimated by gpcc were summarized to reflect the drought characteristics in 7 sub regions and china s mainland and the 12 month spei were selected for annual study the temporal variations of drought area ratio spei12 1 based on gpcc product in 7 sub regions during january1983 december 2015 were drawn in fig 11 the min average and max values of drought area ratio in 7 sub regions were summarized in table 7 the results showed that 1 the variations of drought area ratio implied an increasing trend in sub regions vi and vii fig 11 2 there were more periods with the occurrence of high drought area ratio 0 5 in sub regions i ii iv and v fig 11 3 although the mean values of the drought area ratio in all sub regions were close to each other around 0 17 there were higher max values of the drought area ratio in sub regions i ii iv and v table 7 overall drought in southeastern china had an increasing trend and there was a high tendency for widespread drought in northern china the spatial distribution of average annual drought frequency duration and intensity estimated by 12 month spei based on gpcc product during january 1983 december 2015 over china s mainland were shown in fig 12 and statistics were listed in table 7 the results explained that 1 average annual drought frequency was higher in northern china than it in southern china fig 12 a the values of it based on grids were range from 0 18 to 0 64 and averaged around 0 35 times per year in china its min average and max values in sub regions v vi and vii were relatively higher than other regions 2 on the contrary average drought duration was longer in northern china than it in southern china fig 12 b and its min average and values in sub region i ii iii and iv were higher than other areas table 7 the range and mean value of average drought duration were respectively 5 43 33 5 and 11 36 months in china table 7 3 average drought intensity values were more than 1 26 and less than 0 76 their mean values in 7 sub regions were very close and around 1 in summary the drought events in northern china were usually with lower frequency longer duration and similar intensity than them in southern china 4 discussions 4 1 the discrepancy of precipitation products the precipitation products derived from various sources and disposed in diverse algorithms were distinguished in their accuracy and thus will affect their drought monitoring performance trenberth et al 2014 beck et al 2017 sun et al 2018 explained that satellite based and gauged based products were more adept in catching spatial as well as temporal characteristics respectively and the reanalysis based products have a moderate spatial and temporal depiction performance compared with those two similar conclusions were also reached in this study and it was found that the drought monitoring performance of precipitation datasets depended on their types as well in addition different precipitation products had unique spatial and temporal resolution as well as the range and length of time series ma et al 2021 wei et al 2021 for instance satellite based precipitation datasets were usually with high spatiotemporal resolution and wide coverage but short length of time series due to its late development though gauge based precipitation products were universally with high accuracy table 4 their spatial coverage and resolution would be limited due to the displacement and number of in situ stations schneider et al 2020 yatagai et al 2012 nevertheless not all of precipitation particularly for those with limited data length less than 30 years were adapted for drought monitoring especially for the computation of drought indexes like spi and spei since at least 30 years of data records were compulsorily required in climatic studies giles 2005 lai et al 2019 in addition datasets have been constantly updated funk et al 2015a huffman et al 2019 hersbach et al 2020 the relatively older ones had either obviously coarse resolution or good substitutes xie et al 2003 uppala et al 2005 ma et al 2021 overall all of factors mentioned above would affect the applicability of precipitation products for drought monitoring not absolutely depending on their accuracy compared to observed precipitation 4 2 the regionality of mpes for drought monitoring drought monitoring performance of mpes was region specific owing to the unique weather geographical environment in diverse sub regions in arid and semi arid areas sub regions i ii and iii all mpes performed relatively poor their performance was especially worst for arid sub region i with dryer climate and secondly worst for semi arid sub region iii with special terrains and few in situ stations jiang et al 2021 among of mpes satellite based products persiann cdr and chirps performed worst with r2 rmse and pod around 0 3 0 9 and 0 4 in table 5 due to multiple influences such as algorithm defect aerosol and insufficient error correction datasets kim et al 2017 ma et al 2021 gauge based products gpcc and aphrodite showed best performance than other mpes with r2 rmse and pod around 0 4 0 8 and 0 5 in table 5 though they were also affected by finite number of in situ stations and compared to aphrodite whose performance obviously dropped with expanding timescales gpcc was more stable whose applicability was hardly affected by time scales fig 8 and s 6 in addition although reanalysis based product merra2 slightly outperformed than merged product mswep according to metrics in table 5 merra2 was more susceptible to timescales and mswep was more suitable for large timescales drought monitoring fig 8 and s 6 in semi humid and humid areas sub regions iv v vi and vii all mpes exhibited a higher drought monitoring utility most of them performed relatively better in humid sub regions vi and vii than in semi humid sub regions iv and v table 5 gauge based products gpcc and aphrodite held the optimal applicability of drought monitoring both in humid and semi humid regions since their datasets derived from observed stations which were abundant in these areas schneider et al 2020 yatagai et al 2012 as for the influence of timescales the gpcc dataset was still very stable but aphrodite product was more sensitive fig 8 and s 6 satellite based products chirps and persiann cdr performed worst respectively in semi humid and humid sub regions their drought monitoring performance was still reduced by increasing timescales fig 8 and s 6 contrary to results in arid regions merged product mswep surpassed reanalysis based product merra2 in humid and semi humid regions mswep product was also more stable to timescales than merra2 overall gpcc product was more recommended for drought monitoring in all sub regions for various timescales 4 3 evapotranspiration for drought monitoring evapotranspiration was a critical element for inducing drought and intensifying drought severity verified by numerous studies sheffield et al 2012 dai 2013 otkin et al 2016 since as the trigger of drought water shortage not only relies on the water input like precipitation but also crucially depends on the potential evapotranspiration which receives water from terrestrial water stores affecting water availability on land surfaces and could further enhance vegetation water stress under low soil moisture zampieri et al 2009 vicente serrano et al 2018 the methods for the estimation of evapotranspiration were various though penman monteith was an accurate and traditional method for the estimation of evapotranspiration frequently used in most drought monitoring studies zhong et al 2018 jiang et al 2021 there were also some limitations for it particular in the availability coverage and resolution of data materials needed recently there were numerous evapotranspiration products available such as the north american land data assimilation system nldas simplified surface energy balance operational ssebop the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis i e mod16 and gleam etc martens et al 2017 among of them the satellite derived gleam evapotranspiration products were quite suitable for the estimation of evapotranspiration applied in drought monitoring which comprehensively had better accuracy longer time series wider coverage and higher resolution than other evapotranspiration products miralles et al 2016 martens et al 2017 vicente serrano et al 2018 nevertheless there were still some non negligible errors in gleam products which were more obvious in the western china there still uncertainties in the drought monitoring performance based on gleam and mpes due to the offsetability of errors from them and our results showed that the drought monitoring performance of mpes combined with gleam etp was differed with the accuracy of itself 4 4 the diagnosis of drought characteristics the drought characteristics analysis was one of the significant destinations of drought monitoring xu et al 2015 he et al 2016 and whether data used for drought monitoring could reflect the drought characters correctly was essential the selection of drought event diagnosis methods may affect the results of drought detection traditional approach adopted to detect drought events was usually based on one threshold which may not fully capture the characteristics of long term drought to make up for this deficiency he et al 2016 proposed multi threshold run theory which could avoid a long lasting drought events being divided into a number of minor droughts by a short wet events and more reasonable for drought events diagnosis this study utilized multi threshold run theory to diagnose drought events and analyzed drought characters reflected by mpes combined with gleam etp based on spei and results indicated that not all mpes with high performance of spei estimation accuracy and historical drought events detection could also capture the drought characters well above all there were also some limitations for the study since the density of stations affect the accuracy of precipitation datasets satgé et al 2020 tang et al 2020 the validation in western china should be conducted in various methods in addition drought characters and precipitation products performance were season dependent xu et al 2015 darand et al 2017 the drought monitoring performance of all precipitation products for diverse season was worth to discuss in detail though gleam products were with obvious errors in western china the correlation between it and evapotranspiration calculated by penman monteith equation were pretty high which indicated a great potential for gleam to estimate evapotranspiration more accurately 5 conclusions this study evaluated the drought monitoring performance of 7 mpes containing satellite persiann cdr and chirps reanalysis era5 and merra2 gauge aphrodite and gpcc based and merged mswep precipitation products combined with gleam etp dataset based on spei in 7 sub regions over china s mainland from january 1983 and december 2015 the spei calculated by cpap precipitation product and etp estimated by penman monteith equation and related meteorological data were regard as an observed reference main conclusions were summarized as follows 1 all monthly mpes performed better in eastern china and worse in western china among of mpes the accuracy could be divided into 4 levels from high to low first to fourth levels were gpcc and aphrodite merra2 and mswep chirps and persiann cdr as well as era5 in turn the performance of gleam etp product was well in southern china but poor in northwest desert inner mongolia grassland area and qinghai tibet plateau due to a relatively larger underestimation 2 the drought monitoring applicability of all mpes was regional specific low in parts of northwest desert and qinghai tibet plateau and high in other sub regions it was also susceptible to the timescales of spei and dropped as the expanding timescale among of mpes gpcc product performed comprehensively best than others in drought monitoring in china it was also able to capture the temporal and spatial variation of drought events well 3 in northern china drought events usually have large area ratio longer duration and lower frequency however these characteristics in southern china performed opposite to it in addition the drought in eastern china had an increasing trend in general gauge based precipitation datasets ultimately were the optimal selection for drought monitoring based on spei combined with gleam etp data in the case of ignoring the limitation of spatial and temporal resolution periods and coverage especially for gpcc product these results may give some pertinent suggestions for the selection of data in globe warming related drought study particularly in

2544,understanding the variability and predominant drivers of water level fluctuations in large water bodies is critical for the development of proactive mitigation plans in the nearshore zone here for the first time we reconstructed the individual and collective influence of the atlantic multi decadal oscillation pacific decadal oscillation region 3 4 of el niño southern oscillation and north atlantic oscillation on lake huron michigan s water budget components including water levels over lake precipitation evaporation runoff and river flow rates over a 115 year period conducting wavelet spectral analysis on the reconstructed impact of large scale climate oscillations revealed the emergence of quasi periodic and non stationary fluctuations along with frequency shifts in hydrological variables highlighting their increasingly stronger signature on water levels after 1980 after removing the atmospheric teleconnection effects the residual hydrological time series provided evidence of gradual changes in runoff and river flow rates and their relationships with precipitation reflecting the effects of intensifying anthropogenic activities on the regional water cycle over the past decades considering the uncertainty pertaining to the magnitude and frequency of atmospheric teleconnections in a changing climate the findings of our study can offer a new perspective in our

huron erie and ontario fig 1 collectively form the largest unfrozen freshwater body in the world holding 18 of earth s freshwater supply anderson et al 2021 straddling more than 1600 km of international border between the united states and canada the great lakes are of strategic importance as they provide about 254 6 billion liters of water per day for a variety of industrial agricultural municipal uses and support recreational and commercial shipping industries in the north american continent assel et al 2004 the great lakes have experienced water level fluctuations wlfs greater than the magnitudes registered in many marine coastal areas over the past century gronewold et al 2013 gronewold and stow 2014 large wlfs in the great lakes significantly influence human welfare and prosperity gained from industrial and commercial activities within the surrounding watersheds lamon and stow 2010 low water levels have detrimental impact on hydropower generation tourism sport fishing and shipping industries by hindering transportation and reducing navigational access to docks piers and recreational harbors in shallow areas assel et al 2004 polderman and pryor 2004 in contrast high water levels result in increased erosion of coastal bluffs enhanced dredging costs and inundation of nearshore areas leading to significant property and infrastructure damages lamon and stow 2010 gronewold and stow 2014 viewed from this perspective understanding the interactions among climatic and hydrologic drivers can substantially benefit the design of adaptive management actions to mitigate the impacts of extreme wlfs on communities surrounding the great lakes a great deal of scholarship published over the past two decades polderman and pryor 2004 sellinger et al 2008 hanrahan et al 2009 2010 2014 watras et al 2014 dogan 2016 attempted to identify the annual inter annual near decadal and inter decadal wlf cycles in the great lakes region and determine their relationships with climate oscillations particularly el niño southern oscillation enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and north atlantic oscillation nao several other studies reported significant impacts of enso pdo amo and nao on the hydrology of the upper mid east north american region schulte et al 2016 tan et al 2016 schillerberg and tian 2020 nigam and sengupta 2021 which could ultimately influence wlfs in the great lakes nevertheless the majority of these studies were based on either linear correlation analysis between hydrological variables and climate oscillations or spectral analyses using fourier or nonparametric multi taper methods cohn and robinson 1975 polderman and pryor 2004 changnon 2004 sellinger et al 2008 hanrahan et al 2009 2010 2014 given that these methods are designed to analyze stationary signals they cannot characterize the evolution of transient and non stationary periodicities in hydrological variables over time even more so despite the increasing awareness regarding the interactions among climate oscillations prior studies have mainly focused on the direct effects of individual climate oscillations or the impact of pairs of climate oscillations on hydrological variables ghanbari and bravo 2008 schulte et al 2016 tan et al 2016 nigam and sengupta 2021 trivariate wavelet coherence methodologies i e coherence between a targeted variable and two independent predictors recently adopted in hydroclimatic studies postulate orthogonality between the pairs of predictors considered mihanović et al 2009 hu and si 2016 su et al 2019 which limits their applicability to assess the impact of more than two climate oscillations with potential cross correlations at a time on a targeted hydrological variable alongside the direct and synergistic effects of multiple climate oscillations a wide range of anthropogenic activities can also contribute to the complexity of regional water budgets alterations chawla and mujumdar 2015 there is compelling evidence that anthropogenic activities such as land use land cover lulc changes flow diversion groundwater over extraction and construction of dams flow locks flood control facilities can alter the regional hydrological cycle adnan and atkinson 2011 wang et al 2013 wang et al 2020 in particular lulc changes related to agricultural expansion burning activities deforestation landscape changes on grazing lands and urbanization can significantly influence the magnitude and relative importance of evapotranspiration runoff infiltration groundwater recharge base flow conditions which in turn collectively result in increased flood volumes and peak runoff flow rates sajikumar and remya 2015 sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 hence disentangling the tightly intertwined impact of climate oscillations and anthropogenic activities requires the use of advanced methodologies that can characterize non stationary wlf patterns and shed light on their evolving response to hydrological drivers the present study introduces a state of the art methodology to investigate the nature and underlying drivers of quasi periodic and nonstationary fluctuations of water budget components i e lake water levels over lake precipitation evaporation runoff and river inflow in lake huron michigan lhm over the course of 115 years viewing the variability of hydrological time series as the sum of the effects of large scale atmospheric oscillations regional processes and episodic short term events we first attempt to evaluate the significance of teleconnections between global climate oscillations amo pdo nao and region 3 4 of enso or nino3 4 and hydrological variables the effects of the four climate oscillations on water budget components are then reconstructed while the residual difference between original and reconstructed time series largely encompasses the periodicities driven by regional hydrological processes or alterations induced by anthropogenic activities on the lhm s drainage basin both reconstructed and residual components of the variables pertaining to the water budget are subjected to two dimensional wavelet spectral analysis in order to characterize their shifts and frequency evolution in response to regional and global scale forcing factors over the past century the multiple and partial wavelet coherence strategies presented here overcome the limitations of typically used signal processing methods as they can effectively identify non orthogonal relationships among multiple climate oscillations and hydrological variables at different scales and frequencies hu and si 2016 2021 2 methods 2 1 study site this study focuses on lhm which with a total surface area of 117 000 km2 is considered the largest freshwater impoundment by area on the earth surface fig 1 lakes huron and michigan with maximum depths of 229 m and 281 m dogan 2016 respectively are essentially a single waterbody as they are connected through the 8 km wide and 37 m deep straits of mackinac thereby experiencing approximately equal surface water levels the primary inflow to the lhm system is from st marys river downstream of lake superior and the main outflows are the st clair river which conveys water to lake erie and chicago diversion the latter is the largest and best known out of basin diversion of the great lakes that transfers water from lake michigan to the upper mississippi river basin water flow in st marys river has been regulated through the construction of flow locks in the 1850s 1880s and 1890s followed by dredging and gravel removal between 1908 and 1924 to enable ships to travel between lake superior and the lower great lakes a new lock was constructed in 1943 and two existing locks were also rebuilt in 1968 and 1987 to increase their capacities nevertheless lhm is still the least regulated water body among the great lakes argyilan and forman 2003 and thus could be considered a sensitive proxy to capture the signature of large scale climate oscillations regional hydrologic processes and anthropogenic activities in the great lakes 2 2 data monthly averaged water level over lake precipitation inflow from st

fluctuations in monthly values of water budget components the cwt is performed through the convolution of a discrete time series with a scaled and translated version of a wavelet function ψ the present study used the morlet wavelet function for wavelet analyses defined as torrence and compo 1998 1 ψ η π 1 4 e i ω η e η 2 2 where η and ω are nondimensional time and frequency parameters respectively the present study used the morlet wavelet function with ω 6 which is recommended for the analysis of geophysical time series the cwt for a discrete time series x 1 with a length of n x 1 h h 1 n is defined as grinsted et al 2004 2 w x 1 s n δ t s n 1 n x n ψ n n δ t s where δ t is a uniform timestep s is the scale of the morlet wavelet and η s t the wavelet power at a given scale and time is then given by w x1 s n 2 the statistical significance at 95 confidence level of wavelet powers at different frequencies and scales were tested using a red noise null hypothesis grinsted et al 2004 it is worth noting that cwt has potential edge artifacts hence a cone of influence coi needs to be defined for cwt of a time series more information regarding the coi could be found in grinsted et al 2004 wavelet coherence analysis determines the scales and periodicities at which hydrological variables and climate oscillations follow similar fluctuation patterns wavelet coherence also computes the phase relationship between two time series at different frequencies and scales bivariate wavelet coherence between the two time series of x 1 and y 1 is defined as grinsted et al 2004 3 r n 2 s s s 1 w n x 1 y 1 s 2 s s 1 w n x 1 s 2 s s 1 w n y 1 s 2 where and s is a smoothing operator and w n x 1 y 1 s is the cross wavelet transform i e the product of the wavelet transform of x 1 and the complex conjugate of the wavelet transform of y 1 for a phase θ and period π the phase lag is given by λθ π schulte et al 2016 the statistical significance of wavelet coherence at 95 confidence level was tested using the monte carlo method through generation of a large number of synthetic data pairs with a red noise lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient equivalent to the two input time series more information regarding wavelet coherence can be found in grinsted et al 2004 global wavelet coherence between two time series g c s at a given scale s i e time averaged representation of wavelet coherence was calculated as schulte et al 2016 4 g c s w x 1 y 1 s 2 n 1 n w n x 1 2 n 1 n w n y 1 2 statistical significance of gc s was computed using monte carlo methods following the technique developed by schulte et al 2016 similar to bivariate wavelet coherence multiple wavelet coherence could be defined based on a matrix of auto and cross wavelet power spectra the matrix representation of smoothed auto and cross wavelet power spectra for multiple predictor variables x x 1 x 2 xq can be written as hu and si 2016 5 w x x s n w x 1 x 1 s n w x 1 x 2 s n w x 1 x q s n w x 2 x 1 s n w x 2 x 2 s n w x 2 x q s n w x q x 1 s n w x q x 2 s n w x q x q s n where wxi xj s n is the smoothed auto or cross wavelet power spectra when i j or i j respectively the matrix of smoothed cross wavelet power spectra between response variable y and multiple predictor variables x can be written as hu and si 2016 6 w y x s n w y x 1 s n w y x 2 s n w y x q s n multiple wavelet coherence between the response variable y and multiple predictor variables x can be defined as hu and si 2016 7 r y x 2 s n w y x s n w x x s n 1 w y x s n w y y s n where denotes the complex conjugate the wavelet phase between the response variable y and a predictor variable x 1 can be calculated as hu and si 2016 8 ϕ s n tan 1 im w y x 1 s n re w y x 1 s n where im and re denote the imaginary and real parts of w y x 1 s n respectively more information regarding multiple wavelet coherence could be found in hu and si 2016 similarly the complex partial wavelet coherence between the response variable y and multiple predictor variables x excluding multiple variables z z 1 z 2 zq γy x z s n could be calculated as 9 γ y x z s n 1 r y x z 2 s n γ y x s n 1 r y z 2 s n 1 r x z 2 s n where dictates the excluding variable r 2 y x z and γy x can be calculated as hu and si 2021 10 r y x z 2 s n w y z s n w z z s n 1 w x z s n w y x s n 11 γ y x s n w y x s n w y y s n w x x s n the squared partial wavelet coherence referred as partial wavelet coherence in the results section ρ 2 y x z s n can be calculated as hu and si 2021 12 ρ y x z 2 s n 1 r y x z 2 s n 2 r y x 2 s n 1 r y z 2 s n 1 r x z 2 s n in order to reconstruct the effects of individual or multiple climate oscillations on a particular hydrological variable first the wavelet or multiple wavelet coherence between the climate oscillation s and the target water budget variable was calculated and subsequently the elements of wavelet coherence matrix at which the wavelet multiple wavelet coherence was not statistically significant 95 confidence level were set to zero the rationale for this assumption was that when the wavelet coherence values for certain scales and frequencies did not falsify the null hypothesis then the response and predictor variable s were assumed to be independent schulte et al 2016 finally the time series reflecting the effects of climate oscillation s on a hydrological variable xrec was reconstructed as follows 13 x 1 r e c inv r sig 2 s n w x 1 s n where inv denotes the inverse wavelet transform and r 2 sig s n is the wavelet coherence matrix with non significant elements set to zero the residual component of hydrological variable x1 res reflecting the influence of basin scale processes on the hydrological variable was calculated as 14 x 1 r e s x 1 x 1 r e c it is worth noting that our approach could be used to reconstruct the teleconnection impacts of multiple climate oscillations on a targeted hydrological variable nevertheless considering the data availability for the different climate oscillation indices over the 1900 2015 period the current study focused on the concurrent teleconnection effects of amo pdo nino3 4 and nao even though recent studies have reported evidence that other climate oscillations e g northern annular mode arctic oscillation index nam ao ghanbari and bravo 2008 suriano and leathers 2017 may display a discernible effect on the water levels in the great lakes region the flowchart of the wavelet analysis conducted in this study is shown in fig 2 finally the non parametric mann kendall statistical test mann 1945 kendall 1975 was used to assess the significance of trends in wlfs and hydrological variables the magnitudes of the slopes for the respective trends were determined using sen s method sen 1968 our wavelet analysis was conducted using matlab https www mathworks com products matlab html 3 results 3 1 lake water level fluctuations wavelet coherence between climate oscillations and wlfs was suggestive of intermittent influences of amo pdo and nao on the annual water level fluctuation cycle fig 3 a b d and their effects were found to be statistically significant using the global coherence analysis i e significance of overall coherence throughout the study period fig 3e interestingly the coherence between climate oscillations and water levels have been stronger and more consistent at the interdecadal cycles in particular amo and nao showed statistically significant 95 confidence level coherences with the water levels at 24 and 36 yr periodicities respectively fig 3a d e although a significant portion of the corresponding areas falls outside of the cone of influence wavelet coherence between pdo and lake water levels also showed a significant 24 yr cycle from 1910 to 1985 fig 3b both pdo and nino3 4 displayed significant 12 yr coherent cycles with water levels from 1900 to 1940 but a new 11 year coherent cycle has emerged between nino3 4 and water levels from the 1960s and thereafter fig 3c overall nao was found to be the most influential climate oscillation with statistically significant global coherence at annual near decadal and interdecadal periodicities accounting for 34 of the total variance in recorded wlfs table 1 we also evaluated the presence of non orthogonal interactions among the four climate oscillations examined by conducting cross and partial wavelet coherence analysis our results revealed strong interactions among the climate oscillations particularly for near decadal and interdecadal periodicities fig s1 in supporting information consequently after controlling for the pdo effects the partial wavelet coherence between amo and water levels did not show statistically significant coherence for the 24 yr cycle from 1900 to 1983 fig s2 counter to the registered statistically significant coherence between the two original variables fig 3a similarly compared to wavelet coherences shown in fig 3d the partial wavelet coherence between nao and water levels after accounting for the pdo effects did not show statistically significant coherence for the 12 yr cycle during 1905 1928 fig s2 suggestive of an interplay between nao and pdo hence nonorthogonalities interactions among climate oscillations should be taken into account when evaluating the effects of atmospheric teleconnections on wlfs or hydrological variables we also conducted a multiple wavelet coherence to evaluate the collective influence of amo pdo nino3 4 and nao on water levels over time fig 3f as a general pattern the influence of climate oscillations on wlfs particularly on near decadal periodicities has increased after 1980 overall our analyses demonstrated that the four climate oscillations could collectively account for 52 of the water level variance in lhm the magnitudes of multiple wavelet coherence at statistically significant instances see fig 3f were subsequently used to reconstruct the collective influence of the climate oscillations on wlfs subtracting the reconstructed wlfs induced by climate oscillations from the raw water level records yielded a residual time series predominantly reflecting the direct influence of the regional hydrological processes on wlfs both the reconstructed influence of climate oscillations and residual time series of water level fluctuations were subjected to continuous wavelet transform cwt to evaluate the evolution of their quasi periodic and non stationary fluctuation cycles over time fig 4 a b for the purpose of detecting trends and associated variability the 1 yr and 5 yr moving averages of raw fig 4c reconstructed fig 4d and residual fig 4e water level time series were also calculated based on their respective monthly values similar to the aforementioned results the cwt of the reconstructed influence of climate oscillations on water level fluctuations revealed an intermittent appearance of an annual cycle fig 4a which has remained significant from 2000 and thereafter see also small amplitude annual fluctuations at the right end of fig 4d the cwt also signified the presence of a 36 yr cycle from 1920 to early 1990s although high wavelet powers have been sustained throughout the study period indicating the persistence of a 36 yr fluctuation cycle in the wlf patterns the occurrence of the 36 yr cycle is likely due to the influence of nao to the wlf patterns as both 2d coherence and global wavelet coherence analyses indicated statistically significant coherence between nao and water levels for the 36 yr fluctuation cycle fig 3d e moreover the reconstructed time series has established a significant near decadal or 10 to 12 year cycle since 1980 with a tendency to shift to shorter cycles in more recent years overall the establishment of the new near decadal cycles along with the persistence of the annual cycle after 2000 is suggestive of increased influence of global climate oscillations on high frequency wlfs in lhm lake water level records fig 4c and residual time series fig 4e which presumably reflects the response of the lake to the regional hydrology consistently displayed annual fluctuation patterns throughout the study period see the corresponding gray lines likewise the wavelet power spectra for the residual time series show a statistically significant annual fluctuation cycle throughout the study period fig 4b the annual wlfs manifest the seasonal variations in lake water budget due to inflow over lake precipitation runoff over lake evaporation and outflow the lake water level typically decreases due to increased evaporation during fall and early winter and then gradually increases as spring freshet generates high runoff volumes in addition to the annual cycle the residual water level time series shows a significant interannual cycle which has evolved from an 8 yr to a 5 yr cycle between 1920s and 1990s indicating that regional hydrological variations have increased the frequency of interannual wlfs the residual water level time series has also experienced a significant decreasing trend since mid 1970 which has become more intense after the mid 1980s fig 4e this decreasing trend similarly reflects the gradual change in the regional water budget during the same period 3 2 hydrological variables 3 2 1 precipitation similar to lake water levels the collective effects of climate oscillations on precipitation have been mostly registered on near decadal to interdecadal cycles whereas their influence on the annual precipitation cycle has only been intermittent fig 5 a amo was found to be the most influential climate oscillation table 1 with discernible anti phase 21 yr and 10 yr coherent cycles with precipitation during the 1900 1955 and 1985 2015 periods respectively fig s3a nao displayed a discernible interdecadal 36 yr effect throughout the study period fig s3d characterized by globally significant coherences at this periodicity fig 5b overall the four climate oscillations account for 28 of the precipitation variability table 1 wavelet power spectra for the reconstructed influence of climate oscillations on precipitation suggest an intermittent appearance of a distinct annual cycle fig 5c high wavelet powers were also obtained for the 36 yr precipitation cycle particularly since 1939 when the wavelet powers have become statistically significant fig 5c amo pdo and nino3 4 had clear effects on the interdecadal precipitation cycles fig s3a b c however both individual and global wavelet coherence plots indicated that nao has had the greatest influence on the 36 yr precipitation cycle fig s3d and 5b respectively even though a significant portion of the corresponding sector falls outside the cone of influence except for the sporadic emergence of inter annual precipitation cycles in 1950s and 1980s the wavelet power spectra for the residual time series mostly show a nearly consistent annual cycle fig 5d the 36 yr precipitation cycle detected with the cwt of reconstructed precipitation signals fig 5c effectively suggests the presence of a low frequency sinusoidal pattern fig 5f contributing to a slightly increasing precipitation trend from mid 1960s to mid 1970s followed by a decrease from mid 1970 to late 1980s and again an increasing trend during the 1990s and 2000s since 1990 the raw precipitation data display an increasing trend of 0 5 mm year 1 the most prominent fluctuation pattern for the residual precipitation time series is a nearly consistent annual cycle fig 5d and g the cwt analysis of the residual precipitation time series also revealed an occasional emergence of high wavelet powers albeit not statistically significant according to fig 5d for a 6 year cycle 3 2 2 inflows the multiple wavelet coherence analysis between the four climate oscillations and inflow suggests that their influence is mainly registered with the interdecadal 25 to 30 yr inflow fluctuation cycles fig 6 a intermittent but statistically significant coherences were detected between climate oscillations and inflow for annual and interannual 4 yr cycles fig 6a and s4 which are also reflected in the results of global coherence analysis fig 6b amo and pdo have established interdecadal 25 yr and near decadal 10 yr coherence cycles with inflow since late 1950s and mid 1980s fig s4 respectively overall the four climate oscillations could collectively account for 32 of the registered variance of inflow fluctuations table 1 wavelet power spectra for the reconstructed inflow time series signified the occurrence of annual and inter annual cycles during the study period fig 6c high wavelet powers started to appear in mid 1980s for a 10 yr cycle which have become statistically significant since the mid 1990s see also evidence of a nearly decadal oscillation at the right end of fig 6f the latter fluctuation cycle likely stems from the influence of pdo owing to a strong in phase coherence registered during the same period fig s4 wavelet power spectra for the residual inflow time series consistently show high values for the annual cycle fig 6d by contrast despite the relatively high wavelet powers for interannual and near decadal fluctuation cycles in the residual inflow signal such fluctuation cycles were not found to be statistically significant fig 6d inflows from st marys river have experienced a decreasing trend from late 1960s early 1970s to late 2000s followed by a rapid increase thereafter mostly due to the influence of climate oscillations compare fig 6e and 6f the residual inflow which reflects the effects of regional hydrological and anthropogenic variations on the river inflow also shows a statistically significant decreasing trend with a slope approximately equal to 0 19 mm year 1 since the late 1960s when again the maximum residual inflow values were registered fig 6g the wavelet coherence analysis between residual precipitation and residual inflow signals also showed a gradual increase in periodicity from 3 yr to 5 and 8 yr coherent cycles between the early 1900s and late 1940s followed by a gradual merge of coherent periodicities to a 6 yr cycle in the late 1960s a signal that prevailed until the early 2000s fig s5 thus removing the impact of atmospheric teleconnections on inflow fluctuations allowed identifying the signature of regional scale precipitation patterns gradual changes in residual inflow fluctuation cycles reduced flow rates and differential response to precipitation changes over the past several decades particularly during the construction and later operation of major hydraulic structures e g flow locks reflect the impact of basin scale drivers on st marys inflow rates which subsequently influence the wlfs 3 2 3 runoff similar to the rest of the hydrological variables climate oscillations have mostly influenced the near decadal 12 yr and interdecadal 36 yr runoff fluctuations cycles fig 7 a in particular wavelet coherence analysis revealed the evolution of an anti phase interdecadal relationship between pdo and runoff gradually shifting from a 30 yr to a 21 yr cycle between the 1900s and 2010s fig s6 which was also signified by the global coherence plot fig 7b similarly significant anti phase coherence relationships between runoff and amo and nino3 4 were detected for 30 and 36 yr cycles from 1900 to mid 1960s fig s6 coherence between climate oscillations and the annual runoff cycle has been intermittent fig 7a b and s6 but has become stronger since 2003 indicating the increasing influence of climate oscillations on the annual runoff cycle see also fig 7c overall the four climate oscillations could collectively account for 30 of runoff fluctuations table 1 in addition to an intermittent annual fluctuation cycle wavelet power spectra for the reconstructed influence of climate oscillations on runoff show near decadal and interdecadal periodicities which have gradually declined since the late 1930s and 1970s respectively fig 7c the reappearance of high wavelet powers for the near decadal cycle after the mid 1980s fig 7c as well as the establishment of high wavelet coherences between runoff and pdo nino3 4 nao and to some extent amo for interannual and near decadal scales in the mid 1990s or later fig s6 reinforce our point regarding the altered influence of climatic forcing on runoff to evaluate the interplay between runoff and regional hydrological processes the residual runoff time series was subjected to cwt fig 7d wavelet power spectra plausibly indicated a strong annual cycle in the residual runoff time series in addition consistently high wavelet powers were also obtained for a sub annual 6 month runoff cycle the reason for the appearance of both annual and sub annual cycles stems from the occurrence of two runoff peaks during the calendar year the maximum seasonal runoff typically occurs in early spring due to spring freshet which subsequently decreases during the summer and increases again in late fall partly associated with a reduced overland evapotranspiration music et al 2015 seasonal runoff again decreases in winter since seasonal precipitation are mostly in the form of snow and thus generate relatively lower runoff volumes similar to the cycles observed for the residual wlfs fig 4b the wavelet power analysis of the residual runoff time series provides evidence albeit not statistically significant of an 8 year cycle in the mid 1920s that has evolved to a 5 year in the 1990s fig 7d interestingly cross wavelet spectral analysis between residual water level and residual runoff signals showed high cross wavelet powers for the same interannual periodicities fig s7 which highlights the resemblance between wlf and runoff patterns or in other words periods of distinct influence of runoff on interannual wlfs in lhm substantial lulc changes have occurred in the region influencing the lhm watershed hydrology over the past several decades fig 1 for instance agricultural land and urban developments represented 31 8 and 7 1 of lake michigan s drainage basin in 2010 noaa 2013 respectively similarly large forested areas in the lake huron basin particularly in the southern parts have been primarily converted to croplands and at a smaller scale to sparse urban developments lamp 2015 since the 1950s a wide range of flood mitigation facilities have been constructed in the region notably the intense rainstorms in september 1986 see also fig 7e causing millions of dollars of damages to michigan and southern ontario accelerated the construction of such facilities brown et al 1997 carmichael et al 2020 wavelet coherence analysis between residual precipitation and residual runoff also shows a coherent in phase 5 yr cycle and intermittent coherences for shorter interannual annual and sub annual cycles whereas the interdecadal coherence between residual precipitation and residual runoff were weaker between the mid 1970s and mid 1990s fig s8 overall our results suggest that combined effects of anthropogenic activities and lulc changes in the lhm watershed have resulted in a gradual decrease of interannual fluctuation periods or increase of interannual frequencies in runoff thus notwithstanding the impact of human interventions to reduce the likelihood of flooding events with multidecadal return periods gradually dissipating multidecadal cycle in fig s8 the frequency of interannual occurrence of high runoff volumes tends to increase fig 7d which in turn influences wlfs in lhm figs s7 and 3h analysis of the reconstructed influence of climate oscillations on runoff shows an emergence of annual fluctuations since 2000 fig 7f but no specific trend was detected in the reconstructed runoff time series in contrast both total and residual runoff have experienced a decreasing trend since 1986 fig 6g which reflects the response of surface runoff to human induced changes in the hydrological cycle over the past few decades 3 2 4 evaporation wavelet coherence analysis between climate oscillations and evaporation during the 1950 2015 period underscored their increasing influence particularly amo pdo and nao on the annual evaporation cycle since the mid 1980s fig 8 a b and s9a b d significant interannual coherences between amo nino 3 4 and evaporation were also manifested between the mid 1980s and 2000s fig s9a c as well as a near decadal one between nao and evaporation since the early 1990s fig s9d the associated effects are also reflected in the multiple wavelet coherence analysis fig 8a nevertheless given that the latter coherence between nao and evaporation is relatively recent it has not been detected as statistically significant in the global significance analysis fig 8b note that extensive areas with evidence of higher coherence on fig s9d are mostly out of the cone of influence overall the four climate oscillations approximately account for 52 of the variance in the evaporation time series with amo and pdo having the greatest contribution table 1 wavelet power spectral analysis for the reconstructed influence of climate oscillations on evaporation showed a significant 1 yr fluctuation cycle in the late 1950s which re emerged in the late 1970s and again since the mid 1980s with increasing wavelet power fig 8c given the limited length of the evaporation time series i e from 1950 to 2015 coherence and wavelet spectral analyses of interdecadal periodicities were not possible wavelet power spectra for the residual evaporation time series reflecting the potential impact of regional scale processes suggest a significant annual evaporation cycle throughout the study period fig 8d the latter persistence of high wavelet powers for the residual evaporation annual cycle with cwt analysis is also manifested as discernible annual fluctuations in monthly values of total and residual evaporation see gray dotted lines in fig 8e and g the increased influence of climate oscillations on the 1 yr reconstructed evaporation cycle since the mid 1980s fig 8c can also be seen by the corresponding time series gray dotted line in fig 8f 4 discussion considering the profound economic implications of extreme water levels in the great lakes the influence of global climate oscillations on the hydrological cycle and wlfs has received a great deal of attention cohn and robinson 1975 polderman and pryor 2004 gronewold and stow 2014 hanrahan et al 2014 watras et al 2014 nevertheless the focal point of previous studies has been on pairwise relationships between individual climate oscillations and hydrological variables of interest without explicit consideration of the likelihood of confounding effects by the rest predictors to address this knowledge gap our analysis used a two pronged wavelet coherence framework to account for the non orthogonality among multiple climate oscillations before assessing their direct impacts on variables pertaining to the water budget in doing so we were able to discern patterns of significant covariance among the large scale climate oscillations which can in turn magnify offset their individual effects on the hydrological cycle and lake water levels given also the documented disparity among the current coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 cmip3 and phase 5 cmip5 climate models regarding the atmospheric teleconnection changes from region to region shah et al 2022 the results of the present study are highly relevant for the long term planning of the shoreline against the implications of water level variability recent cwt and wavelet coherence analysis signified the presence of 1 8 12 and 36 yr wlf periodicities in lhm between 1860 and 2015 cheng et al 2021 the same study highlighted the role of runoff and evaporation as the primary predictors for seasonal variability of monthly water level differential followed by precipitation river inflows and outflows building upon these findings the present analysis revealed an increasing influence of climate oscillations on the annual precipitation and evaporation cycles since the late 1970s the emergence of high wavelet power for the decadal inflow cycle after the 1980s the gradual dissipation of interdecadal runoff cycle just after the 1970s followed by the emergence of high wavelet power for a near decadal runoff cycle which could have collectively led to the establishment of a near decadal 12 yr wlf cycle in lhm these findings underscore the increasing influence of large scale climate oscillations on the regional hydrologic budget since the early 1980s our coherence analysis suggests that amo pdo and nino3 4 have primarily influenced the interannual to near decadal wlf oscillations nearly anti phase relationships fig 3a c while nao has shaped the interdecadal climate oscillations a nearly in phase relationship in fig 3d also compare the 5 yr moving averages in fig 4c and s10 given the influence of precipitation on runoff and river inflows within a basin reconstructing the impacts of climate oscillations on precipitation variability can improve our predictive capacity of lake water levels in this regard the establishment of a 36 yr precipitation cycle fig 5a and s11 primarily due to nao fig 5b and s3 in the early 1940s followed by its amplification due to the synergistic influence of nino3 4 in the 1960s fig s3 is suggestive of a clear causal linkage between climate oscillations and long term precipitation trends the above average precipitation in 1940s and later in 1970s due to the influence of the 36 yr climate driven precipitation cycle fig s11 triggered increased runoff fig 7e and inflows fig 6e to the lake resulting in a marked increase of lake water levels during the corresponding periods fig 4c likewise below average precipitations in the late 1980s and 1990s fig s11 gradually reduced the lake water levels fig 4c considering that the latest peak of the 36 yr climate driven precipitation cycle occurred in 2010 fig s11 above average precipitation was expected to occur until approximately the end of the 2010s inducing elevated lake water levels and will likely be followed by reduced precipitations after 2020 thereby creating conditions conducive to reduced water levels evaporation typically displays strong annual periodicity and can distinctly shape the water budget seasonality but its impact on wlfs at interannual scales is typically considered minimal cheng et al 2021 nevertheless if we inspect the monthly evaporation data we can infer that gradual shifts occur in the seasonal hydrological cycle over the past few decades for example the average over lake evaporation between june and october has increased by 3 31 mm since 1986 fig s12 and the same trend holds for the annual over lake evaporation minima with a statistically significant increase of 0 17 mm year 1 fig s13 warmer temperatures have also resulted in a statistically significant decrease of the maximum lake ice cover by 0 55 per year since 1974 fig s14 the latter trends could also have important implications for winter evaporation see also deviations of the evaporation in february from the global mean fig s12 when the highest rates occur largely owing to unstable air conditions generated by lake water temperatures higher than air temperatures javed et al 2019 shah et al 2022 comparisons of monthly runoff values between 1915 and 1986 and 1987 2015 show a statistically significant runoff increase during late fall and winter months november february and in contrast a distinct decrease in the spring march may fig s15 hence it could be inferred that precipitation during late fall to winter may have gradually shifted from snow to rain and consequently reduced the magnitude of the spring freshet these results are consistent with recent findings in the area that report an increase in the minimum annual winter air temperature in southern and central ontario since the 1950s javed et al 2019 shah et al 2022 leading to the prevalence of more frequent conditions of rain precipitation during the cold season in the great lakes basin modelling work has suggested that surface runoff may change from a bimodal delivery pattern quiescent period followed by intense spring freshet in cold winters to an intermittent water export during warm winters reflective of a meteorological forcing and subsequent tributary response observed during any other time of the year while these predictions are corroborated by recent empirical evidence other hypotheses further suggest that elevated winter air temperature could increase surface permeability as opposed to an impermeable frozen surface resulting in a greater potential for infiltration and or groundwater recharge and thus creating conditions that are not necessarily conducive to an increase in runoff and or erosion javed et al 2019 shah et al 2022 even more so recent evidence suggests that the aforementioned gradual shifts of the hydrological cycle can be further amplified by short term weather variations in the form of more intense precipitation events although the granularity of our analysis is not sufficient to consolidate trends in hydrologic extremes the nonstationary conditions arising from climate change may facilitate aberrant weather conditions by magnifying the severity of within season droughts altering seasonal evapotranspiration increasing the intensity of 30 min or 24 hr storms and ultimately leading to episodes of excessive runoff and flooding especially in urbanized settings shah et al 2022 5 conclusions the present study offered insights into the evolution of quasi state and non stationary fluctuations in lmh s water budget variables and disentangled the impact of teleconnections of climate oscillations from basin scale hydrological processes in the great lakes region our results indicated that the effects of climate oscillations on lake water budget are mostly registered at inter annual to inter decadal scales specifically in reconstructing the role of the global climate oscillations we found an increasing influence on the annual precipitation and evaporation cycles an emergence of high wavelet power for the decadal inflow cycle a gradual dissipation of interdecadal runoff cycle followed by the emergence of high wavelet power for a near decadal runoff cycle which could have collectively evolved into a near decadal 12 yr water level fluctuation cycle in lake huron michigan thus consistent with existing predictions and empirical evidence that global warming not only drives thermodynamic changes related to latent and sensible heat transfer but can also change atmospheric circulation patterns our results provide evidence of an increasing influence of the large scale climate oscillations on the regional hydrologic budget over the past few decades after removing the atmospheric teleconnection effects the residual hydrological time series suggest gradual changes in runoff and river flow rates and their relationships with precipitation reflecting the effects of intensifying anthropogenic activities urbanization agriculture flood control on the regional water cycle the identified importance of the teleconnection effects should be factored in alongside the gradual shifts or episodic short term variations in the seasonal hydrological cycle due to climate change or human induced urbanization agriculture changes in the landscape we thus predict that lhm will be subjected to a wider range of water level fluctuations with profound implications for the human environment system equilibrium particularly in the nearshore zone in light of the presented evidence of increased transmissivity of the signals of large scale atmospheric teleconnections along with the recent advancements of our understanding of the hydrologic impacts of urbanization and agriculture we believe the establishment of reliable tools to forecast water level variability is more critical than ever before in this regard given the influence of precipitation on runoff and river inflows the reconstruction of the impacts of climate oscillations on precipitation can improve our predictive capacity of lake wlfs it is important to bear in mind though that any modelling tool should include a margin of safety with the predictive statements drawn to account for the increasing

for the first time we reconstructed the individual and collective influence of the atlantic multi decadal oscillation pacific decadal oscillation region 3 4 of el niño southern oscillation and north atlantic oscillation on lake huron michigan s water budget components including water levels over lake precipitation evaporation runoff and river flow rates over a 115 year period conducting wavelet spectral analysis on the reconstructed impact of large scale climate oscillations revealed the emergence of quasi periodic and non stationary fluctuations along with frequency shifts in hydrological variables highlighting their increasingly stronger signature on water levels after 1980 after removing the atmospheric teleconnection effects the residual hydrological time series provided evidence of gradual changes in runoff and river flow rates and their relationships with precipitation reflecting the effects of intensifying anthropogenic activities on the regional water cycle over the past decades considering the uncertainty pertaining to the magnitude and frequency of atmospheric teleconnections in a changing climate the findings of our study can offer a new perspective in our understanding of the drivers of water level variability along the shoreline and or the navigability of shallow waters in the great lakes keywords lake water budget extreme water levels lake huron michigan climate oscillations climate change adaptive management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the laurentian great lakes comprising lakes superior michigan huron erie and ontario fig 1 collectively form the largest unfrozen freshwater body in the world holding 18 of earth s freshwater supply anderson et al 2021 straddling more than 1600 km of international border between the united states and canada the great lakes are of strategic importance as they provide about 254 6 billion liters of water per day for a variety of industrial agricultural municipal uses and support recreational and commercial shipping industries in the north american continent assel et al 2004 the great lakes have experienced water level fluctuations wlfs greater than the magnitudes registered in many marine coastal areas over the past century gronewold et al 2013 gronewold and stow 2014 large wlfs in the great lakes significantly influence human welfare and prosperity gained from industrial and commercial activities within the surrounding watersheds lamon and stow 2010 low water levels have detrimental impact on hydropower generation tourism sport fishing and shipping industries by hindering transportation and reducing navigational access to docks piers and recreational harbors in shallow areas assel et al 2004 polderman and pryor 2004 in contrast high water levels result in increased erosion of coastal bluffs enhanced dredging costs and inundation of nearshore areas leading to significant property and infrastructure damages lamon and stow 2010 gronewold and stow 2014 viewed from this perspective understanding the interactions among climatic and hydrologic drivers can substantially benefit the design of adaptive management actions to mitigate the impacts of extreme wlfs on communities surrounding the great lakes a great deal of scholarship published over the past two decades polderman and pryor 2004 sellinger et al 2008 hanrahan et al 2009 2010 2014 watras et al 2014 dogan 2016 attempted to identify the annual inter annual near decadal and inter decadal wlf cycles in the great lakes region and determine their relationships with climate oscillations particularly el niño southern oscillation enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and north atlantic oscillation nao several other studies reported significant impacts of enso pdo amo and nao on the hydrology of the upper mid east north american region schulte et al 2016 tan et al 2016 schillerberg and tian 2020 nigam and sengupta 2021 which could ultimately influence wlfs in the great lakes nevertheless the majority of these studies were based on either linear correlation analysis between hydrological variables and climate oscillations or spectral analyses using fourier or nonparametric multi taper methods cohn and robinson 1975 polderman and pryor 2004 changnon 2004 sellinger et al 2008 hanrahan et al 2009 2010 2014 given that these methods are designed to analyze stationary signals they cannot characterize the evolution of transient and non stationary periodicities in hydrological variables over time even more so despite the increasing awareness regarding the interactions among climate oscillations prior studies have mainly focused on the direct effects of individual climate oscillations or the impact of pairs of climate oscillations on hydrological variables ghanbari and bravo 2008 schulte et al 2016 tan et al 2016 nigam and sengupta 2021 trivariate wavelet coherence methodologies i e coherence between a targeted variable and two independent predictors recently adopted in hydroclimatic studies postulate orthogonality between the pairs of predictors considered mihanović et al 2009 hu and si 2016 su et al 2019 which limits their applicability to assess the impact of more than two climate oscillations with potential cross correlations at a time on a targeted hydrological variable alongside the direct and synergistic effects of multiple climate oscillations a wide range of anthropogenic activities can also contribute to the complexity of regional water budgets alterations chawla and mujumdar 2015 there is compelling evidence that anthropogenic activities such as land use land cover lulc changes flow diversion groundwater over extraction and construction of dams flow locks flood control facilities can alter the regional hydrological cycle adnan and atkinson 2011 wang et al 2013 wang et al 2020 in particular lulc changes related to agricultural expansion burning activities deforestation landscape changes on grazing lands and urbanization can significantly influence the magnitude and relative importance of evapotranspiration runoff infiltration groundwater recharge base flow conditions which in turn collectively result in increased flood volumes and peak runoff flow rates sajikumar and remya 2015 sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 hence disentangling the tightly intertwined impact of climate oscillations and anthropogenic activities requires the use of advanced methodologies that can characterize non stationary wlf patterns and shed light on their evolving response to hydrological drivers the present study introduces a state of the art methodology to investigate the nature and underlying drivers of quasi periodic and nonstationary fluctuations of water budget components i e lake water levels over lake precipitation evaporation runoff and river inflow in lake huron michigan lhm over the course of 115 years viewing the variability of hydrological time series as the sum of the effects of large scale atmospheric oscillations regional processes and episodic short term events we first attempt to evaluate the significance of teleconnections between global climate oscillations amo pdo nao and region 3 4 of enso or nino3 4 and hydrological variables the effects of the four climate oscillations on water budget components are then reconstructed while the residual difference between original and reconstructed time series largely encompasses the periodicities driven by regional hydrological processes or alterations induced by anthropogenic activities on the lhm s drainage basin both reconstructed and residual components of the variables pertaining to the water budget are subjected to two dimensional wavelet spectral analysis in order to characterize their shifts and frequency evolution in response to regional and global scale forcing factors over the past century the multiple and partial wavelet coherence strategies presented here overcome the limitations of typically used signal processing methods as they can effectively identify non orthogonal relationships among multiple climate oscillations and hydrological variables at different scales and frequencies hu and si 2016 2021 2 methods 2 1 study site this study focuses on lhm which with a total surface area of 117 000 km2 is considered the largest freshwater impoundment by area on the earth surface fig 1 lakes huron and michigan with maximum depths of 229 m and 281 m dogan 2016 respectively are essentially a single waterbody as they are connected through the 8 km wide and 37 m deep straits of mackinac thereby experiencing approximately equal surface water levels the primary inflow to the lhm system is from st marys river downstream of lake superior and the main outflows are the st clair river which conveys water to lake erie and chicago diversion the latter is the largest and best known out of basin diversion of the great lakes that transfers water from lake michigan to the upper mississippi river basin water flow in st marys river has been regulated through the construction of flow locks in the 1850s 1880s and 1890s followed by dredging and gravel removal between 1908 and 1924 to enable ships to travel between lake superior and the lower great lakes a new lock was constructed in 1943 and two existing locks were also rebuilt in 1968 and 1987 to increase their capacities nevertheless lhm is still the least regulated water body among the great lakes argyilan and forman 2003 and thus could be considered a sensitive proxy to capture the signature of large scale climate oscillations regional hydrologic processes and anthropogenic activities in the great lakes 2 2 data monthly averaged water level over lake precipitation inflow from st

nalcms database https www cec org north american land change monitoring system 2 3 wavelet analysis the present study used continuous wavelet transform cwt to detect quasi periodic and non stationary fluctuations in monthly values of water budget components the cwt is performed through the convolution of a discrete time series with a scaled and translated version of a wavelet function ψ the present study used the morlet wavelet function for wavelet analyses defined as torrence and compo 1998 1 ψ η π 1 4 e i ω η e η 2 2 where η and ω are nondimensional time and frequency parameters respectively the present study used the morlet wavelet function with ω 6 which is recommended for the analysis of geophysical time series the cwt for a discrete time series x 1 with a length of n x 1 h h 1 n is defined as grinsted et al 2004 2 w x 1 s n δ t s n 1 n x n ψ n n δ t s where δ t is a uniform timestep s is the scale of the morlet wavelet and η s t the wavelet power at a given scale and time is then given by w x1 s n 2 the statistical significance at 95 confidence level of wavelet powers at different frequencies and scales were tested using a red noise null hypothesis grinsted et al 2004 it is worth noting that cwt has potential edge artifacts hence a cone of influence coi needs to be defined for cwt of a time series more information regarding the coi could be found in grinsted et al 2004 wavelet coherence analysis determines the scales and periodicities at which hydrological variables and climate oscillations follow similar fluctuation patterns wavelet coherence also computes the phase relationship between two time series at different frequencies and scales bivariate wavelet coherence between the two time series of x 1 and y 1 is defined as grinsted et al 2004 3 r n 2 s s s 1 w n x 1 y 1 s 2 s s 1 w n x 1 s 2 s s 1 w n y 1 s 2 where and s is a smoothing operator and w n x 1 y 1 s is the cross wavelet transform i e the product of the wavelet transform of x 1 and the complex conjugate of the wavelet transform of y 1 for a phase θ and period π the phase lag is given by λθ π schulte et al 2016 the statistical significance of wavelet coherence at 95 confidence level was tested using the monte carlo method through generation of a large number of synthetic data pairs with a red noise lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient equivalent to the two input time series more information regarding wavelet coherence can be found in grinsted et al 2004 global wavelet coherence between two time series g c s at a given scale s i e time averaged representation of wavelet coherence was calculated as schulte et al 2016 4 g c s w x 1 y 1 s 2 n 1 n w n x 1 2 n 1 n w n y 1 2 statistical significance of gc s was computed using monte carlo methods following the technique developed by schulte et al 2016 similar to bivariate wavelet coherence multiple wavelet coherence could be defined based on a matrix of auto and cross wavelet power spectra the matrix representation of smoothed auto and cross wavelet power spectra for multiple predictor variables x x 1 x 2 xq can be written as hu and si 2016 5 w x x s n w x 1 x 1 s n w x 1 x 2 s n w x 1 x q s n w x 2 x 1 s n w x 2 x 2 s n w x 2 x q s n w x q x 1 s n w x q x 2 s n w x q x q s n where wxi xj s n is the smoothed auto or cross wavelet power spectra when i j or i j respectively the matrix of smoothed cross wavelet power spectra between response variable y and multiple predictor variables x can be written as hu and si 2016 6 w y x s n w y x 1 s n w y x 2 s n w y x q s n multiple wavelet coherence between the response variable y and multiple predictor variables x can be defined as hu and si 2016 7 r y x 2 s n w y x s n w x x s n 1 w y x s n w y y s n where denotes the complex conjugate the wavelet phase between the response variable y and a predictor variable x 1 can be calculated as hu and si 2016 8 ϕ s n tan 1 im w y x 1 s n re w y x 1 s n where im and re denote the imaginary and real parts of w y x 1 s n respectively more information regarding multiple wavelet coherence could be found in hu and si 2016 similarly the complex partial wavelet coherence between the response variable y and multiple predictor variables x excluding multiple variables z z 1 z 2 zq γy x z s n could be calculated as 9 γ y x z s n 1 r y x z 2 s n γ y x s n 1 r y z 2 s n 1 r x z 2 s n where dictates the excluding variable r 2 y x z and γy x can be calculated as hu and si 2021 10 r y x z 2 s n w y z s n w z z s n 1 w x z s n w y x s n 11 γ y x s n w y x s n w y y s n w x x s n the squared partial wavelet coherence referred as partial wavelet coherence in the results section ρ 2 y x z s n can be calculated as hu and si 2021 12 ρ y x z 2 s n 1 r y x z 2 s n 2 r y x 2 s n 1 r y z 2 s n 1 r x z 2 s n in order to reconstruct the effects of individual or multiple climate oscillations on a particular hydrological variable first the wavelet or multiple wavelet coherence between the climate oscillation s and the target water budget variable was calculated and subsequently the elements of wavelet coherence matrix at which the wavelet multiple wavelet coherence was not statistically significant 95 confidence level were set to zero the rationale for this assumption was that when the wavelet coherence values for certain scales and frequencies did not falsify the null hypothesis then the response and predictor variable s were assumed to be independent schulte et al 2016 finally the time series reflecting the effects of climate oscillation s on a hydrological variable xrec was reconstructed as follows 13 x 1 r e c inv r sig 2 s n w x 1 s n where inv denotes the inverse wavelet transform and r 2 sig s n is the wavelet coherence matrix with non significant elements set to zero the residual component of hydrological variable x1 res reflecting the influence of basin scale processes on the hydrological variable was calculated as 14 x 1 r e s x 1 x 1 r e c it is worth noting that our approach could be used to reconstruct the teleconnection impacts of multiple climate oscillations on a targeted hydrological variable nevertheless considering the data availability for the different climate oscillation indices over the 1900 2015 period the current study focused on the concurrent teleconnection effects of amo pdo nino3 4 and nao even though recent studies have reported evidence that other climate oscillations e g northern annular mode arctic oscillation index nam ao ghanbari and bravo 2008 suriano and leathers 2017 may display a discernible effect on the water levels in the great lakes region the flowchart of the wavelet analysis conducted in this study is shown in fig 2 finally the non parametric mann kendall statistical test mann 1945 kendall 1975 was used to assess the significance of trends in wlfs and hydrological variables the magnitudes of the slopes for the respective trends were determined using sen s method sen 1968 our wavelet analysis was conducted using matlab https www mathworks com products matlab html 3 results 3 1 lake water level fluctuations wavelet coherence between climate oscillations and wlfs was suggestive of intermittent influences of amo pdo and nao on the annual water level fluctuation cycle fig 3 a b d and their effects were found to be statistically significant using the global coherence analysis i e significance of overall coherence throughout the study period fig 3e interestingly the coherence between climate oscillations and water levels have been stronger and more consistent at the interdecadal cycles in particular amo and nao showed statistically significant 95 confidence level coherences with the water levels at 24 and 36 yr periodicities respectively fig 3a d e although a significant portion of the corresponding areas falls outside of the cone of influence wavelet coherence between pdo and lake water levels also showed a significant 24 yr cycle from 1910 to 1985 fig 3b both pdo and nino3 4 displayed significant 12 yr coherent cycles with water levels from 1900 to 1940 but a new 11 year coherent cycle has emerged between nino3 4 and water levels from the 1960s and thereafter fig 3c overall nao was found to be the most influential climate oscillation with statistically significant global coherence at annual near decadal and interdecadal periodicities accounting for 34 of the total variance in recorded wlfs table 1 we also evaluated the presence of non orthogonal interactions among the four climate oscillations examined by conducting cross and partial wavelet coherence analysis our results revealed strong interactions among the climate oscillations particularly for near decadal and interdecadal periodicities fig s1 in supporting information consequently after controlling for the pdo effects the partial wavelet coherence between amo and water levels did not show statistically significant coherence for the 24 yr cycle from 1900 to 1983 fig s2 counter to the registered statistically significant coherence between the two original variables fig 3a similarly compared to wavelet coherences shown in fig 3d the partial wavelet coherence between nao and water levels after accounting for the pdo effects did not show statistically significant coherence for the 12 yr cycle during 1905 1928 fig s2 suggestive of an interplay between nao and pdo hence nonorthogonalities interactions among climate oscillations should be taken into account when evaluating the effects of atmospheric teleconnections on wlfs or hydrological variables we also conducted a multiple wavelet coherence to evaluate the collective influence of amo pdo nino3 4 and nao on water levels over time fig 3f as a general pattern the influence of climate oscillations on wlfs particularly on near decadal periodicities has increased after 1980 overall our analyses demonstrated that the four climate oscillations could collectively account for 52 of the water level variance in lhm the magnitudes of multiple wavelet coherence at statistically significant instances see fig 3f were subsequently used to reconstruct the collective influence of the climate oscillations on wlfs subtracting the reconstructed wlfs induced by climate oscillations from the raw water level records yielded a residual time series predominantly reflecting the direct influence of the regional hydrological processes on wlfs both the reconstructed influence of climate oscillations and residual time series of water level fluctuations were subjected to continuous wavelet transform cwt to evaluate the evolution of their quasi periodic and non stationary fluctuation cycles over time fig 4 a b for the purpose of detecting trends and associated variability the 1 yr and 5 yr moving averages of raw fig 4c reconstructed fig 4d and residual fig 4e water level time series were also calculated based on their respective monthly values similar to the aforementioned results the cwt of the reconstructed influence of climate oscillations on water level fluctuations revealed an intermittent appearance of an annual cycle fig 4a which has remained significant from 2000 and thereafter see also small amplitude annual fluctuations at the right end of fig 4d the cwt also signified the presence of a 36 yr cycle from 1920 to early 1990s although high wavelet powers have been sustained throughout the study period indicating the persistence of a 36 yr fluctuation cycle in the wlf patterns the occurrence of the 36 yr cycle is likely due to the influence of nao to the wlf patterns as both 2d coherence and global wavelet coherence analyses indicated statistically significant coherence between nao and water levels for the 36 yr fluctuation cycle fig 3d e moreover the reconstructed time series has established a significant near decadal or 10 to 12 year cycle since 1980 with a tendency to shift to shorter cycles in more recent years overall the establishment of the new near decadal cycles along with the persistence of the annual cycle after 2000 is suggestive of increased influence of global climate oscillations on high frequency wlfs in lhm lake water level records fig 4c and residual time series fig 4e which presumably reflects the response of the lake to the regional hydrology consistently displayed annual fluctuation patterns throughout the study period see the corresponding gray lines likewise the wavelet power spectra for the residual time series show a statistically significant annual fluctuation cycle throughout the study period fig 4b the annual wlfs manifest the seasonal variations in lake water budget due to inflow over lake precipitation runoff over lake evaporation and outflow the lake water level typically decreases due to increased evaporation during fall and early winter and then gradually increases as spring freshet generates high runoff volumes in addition to the annual cycle the residual water level time series shows a significant interannual cycle which has evolved from an 8 yr to a 5 yr cycle between 1920s and 1990s indicating that regional hydrological variations have increased the frequency of interannual wlfs the residual water level time series has also experienced a significant decreasing trend since mid 1970 which has become more intense after the mid 1980s fig 4e this decreasing trend similarly reflects the gradual change in the regional water budget during the same period 3 2 hydrological variables 3 2 1 precipitation similar to lake water levels the collective effects of climate oscillations on precipitation have been mostly registered on near decadal to interdecadal cycles whereas their influence on the annual precipitation cycle has only been intermittent fig 5 a amo was found to be the most influential climate oscillation table 1 with discernible anti phase 21 yr and 10 yr coherent cycles with precipitation during the 1900 1955 and 1985 2015 periods respectively fig s3a nao displayed a discernible interdecadal 36 yr effect throughout the study period fig s3d characterized by globally significant coherences at this periodicity fig 5b overall the four climate oscillations account for 28 of the precipitation variability table 1 wavelet power spectra for the reconstructed influence of climate oscillations on precipitation suggest an intermittent appearance of a distinct annual cycle fig 5c high wavelet powers were also obtained for the 36 yr precipitation cycle particularly since 1939 when the wavelet powers have become statistically significant fig 5c amo pdo and nino3 4 had clear effects on the interdecadal precipitation cycles fig s3a b c however both individual and global wavelet coherence plots indicated that nao has had the greatest influence on the 36 yr precipitation cycle fig s3d and 5b respectively even though a significant portion of the corresponding sector falls outside the cone of influence except for the sporadic emergence of inter annual precipitation cycles in 1950s and 1980s the wavelet power spectra for the residual time series mostly show a nearly consistent annual cycle fig 5d the 36 yr precipitation cycle detected with the cwt of reconstructed precipitation signals fig 5c effectively suggests the presence of a low frequency sinusoidal pattern fig 5f contributing to a slightly increasing precipitation trend from mid 1960s to mid 1970s followed by a decrease from mid 1970 to late 1980s and again an increasing trend during the 1990s and 2000s since 1990 the raw precipitation data display an increasing trend of 0 5 mm year 1 the most prominent fluctuation pattern for the residual precipitation time series is a nearly consistent annual cycle fig 5d and g the cwt analysis of the residual precipitation time series also revealed an occasional emergence of high wavelet powers albeit not statistically significant according to fig 5d for a 6 year cycle 3 2 2 inflows the multiple wavelet coherence analysis between the four climate oscillations and inflow suggests that their influence is mainly registered with the interdecadal 25 to 30 yr inflow fluctuation cycles fig 6 a intermittent but statistically significant coherences were detected between climate oscillations and inflow for annual and interannual 4 yr cycles fig 6a and s4 which are also reflected in the results of global coherence analysis fig 6b amo and pdo have established interdecadal 25 yr and near decadal 10 yr coherence cycles with inflow since late 1950s and mid 1980s fig s4 respectively overall the four climate oscillations could collectively account for 32 of the registered variance of inflow fluctuations table 1 wavelet power spectra for the reconstructed inflow time series signified the occurrence of annual and inter annual cycles during the study period fig 6c high wavelet powers started to appear in mid 1980s for a 10 yr cycle which have become statistically significant since the mid 1990s see also evidence of a nearly decadal oscillation at the right end of fig 6f the latter fluctuation cycle likely stems from the influence of pdo owing to a strong in phase coherence registered during the same period fig s4 wavelet power spectra for the residual inflow time series consistently show high values for the annual cycle fig 6d by contrast despite the relatively high wavelet powers for interannual and near decadal fluctuation cycles in the residual inflow signal such fluctuation cycles were not found to be statistically significant fig 6d inflows from st marys river have experienced a decreasing trend from late 1960s early 1970s to late 2000s followed by a rapid increase thereafter mostly due to the influence of climate oscillations compare fig 6e and 6f the residual inflow which reflects the effects of regional hydrological and anthropogenic variations on the river inflow also shows a statistically significant decreasing trend with a slope approximately equal to 0 19 mm year 1 since the late 1960s when again the maximum residual inflow values were registered fig 6g the wavelet coherence analysis between residual precipitation and residual inflow signals also showed a gradual increase in periodicity from 3 yr to 5 and 8 yr coherent cycles between the early 1900s and late 1940s followed by a gradual merge of coherent periodicities to a 6 yr cycle in the late 1960s a signal that prevailed until the early 2000s fig s5 thus removing the impact of atmospheric teleconnections on inflow fluctuations allowed identifying the signature of regional scale precipitation patterns gradual changes in residual inflow fluctuation cycles reduced flow rates and differential response to precipitation changes over the past several decades particularly during the construction and later operation of major hydraulic structures e g flow locks reflect the impact of basin scale drivers on st marys inflow rates which subsequently influence the wlfs 3 2 3 runoff similar to the rest of the hydrological variables climate oscillations have mostly influenced the near decadal 12 yr and interdecadal 36 yr runoff fluctuations cycles fig 7 a in particular wavelet coherence analysis revealed the evolution of an anti phase interdecadal relationship between pdo and runoff gradually shifting from a 30 yr to a 21 yr cycle between the 1900s and 2010s fig s6 which was also signified by the global coherence plot fig 7b similarly significant anti phase coherence relationships between runoff and amo and nino3 4 were detected for 30 and 36 yr cycles from 1900 to mid 1960s fig s6 coherence between climate oscillations and the annual runoff cycle has been intermittent fig 7a b and s6 but has become stronger since 2003 indicating the increasing influence of climate oscillations on the annual runoff cycle see also fig 7c overall the four climate oscillations could collectively account for 30 of runoff fluctuations table 1 in addition to an intermittent annual fluctuation cycle wavelet power spectra for the reconstructed influence of climate oscillations on runoff show near decadal and interdecadal periodicities which have gradually declined since the late 1930s and 1970s respectively fig 7c the reappearance of high wavelet powers for the near decadal cycle after the mid 1980s fig 7c as well as the establishment of high wavelet coherences between runoff and pdo nino3 4 nao and to some extent amo for interannual and near decadal scales in the mid 1990s or later fig s6 reinforce our point regarding the altered influence of climatic forcing on runoff to evaluate the interplay between runoff and regional hydrological processes the residual runoff time series was subjected to cwt fig 7d wavelet power spectra plausibly indicated a strong annual cycle in the residual runoff time series in addition consistently high wavelet powers were also obtained for a sub annual 6 month runoff cycle the reason for the appearance of both annual and sub annual cycles stems from the occurrence of two runoff peaks during the calendar year the maximum seasonal runoff typically occurs in early spring due to spring freshet which subsequently decreases during the summer and increases again in late fall partly associated with a reduced overland evapotranspiration music et al 2015 seasonal runoff again decreases in winter since seasonal precipitation are mostly in the form of snow and thus generate relatively lower runoff volumes similar to the cycles observed for the residual wlfs fig 4b the wavelet power analysis of the residual runoff time series provides evidence albeit not statistically significant of an 8 year cycle in the mid 1920s that has evolved to a 5 year in the 1990s fig 7d interestingly cross wavelet spectral analysis between residual water level and residual runoff signals showed high cross wavelet powers for the same interannual periodicities fig s7 which highlights the resemblance between wlf and runoff patterns or in other words periods of distinct influence of runoff on interannual wlfs in lhm substantial lulc changes have occurred in the region influencing the lhm watershed hydrology over the past several decades fig 1 for instance agricultural land and urban developments represented 31 8 and 7 1 of lake michigan s drainage basin in 2010 noaa 2013 respectively similarly large forested areas in the lake huron basin particularly in the southern parts have been primarily converted to croplands and at a smaller scale to sparse urban developments lamp 2015 since the 1950s a wide range of flood mitigation facilities have been constructed in the region notably the intense rainstorms in september 1986 see also fig 7e causing millions of dollars of damages to michigan and southern ontario accelerated the construction of such facilities brown et al 1997 carmichael et al 2020 wavelet coherence analysis between residual precipitation and residual runoff also shows a coherent in phase 5 yr cycle and intermittent coherences for shorter interannual annual and sub annual cycles whereas the interdecadal coherence between residual precipitation and residual runoff were weaker between the mid 1970s and mid 1990s fig s8 overall our results suggest that combined effects of anthropogenic activities and lulc changes in the lhm watershed have resulted in a gradual decrease of interannual fluctuation periods or increase of interannual frequencies in runoff thus notwithstanding the impact of human interventions to reduce the likelihood of flooding events with multidecadal return periods gradually dissipating multidecadal cycle in fig s8 the frequency of interannual occurrence of high runoff volumes tends to increase fig 7d which in turn influences wlfs in lhm figs s7 and 3h analysis of the reconstructed influence of climate oscillations on runoff shows an emergence of annual fluctuations since 2000 fig 7f but no specific trend was detected in the reconstructed runoff time series in contrast both total and residual runoff have experienced a decreasing trend since 1986 fig 6g which reflects the response of surface runoff to human induced changes in the hydrological cycle over the past few decades 3 2 4 evaporation wavelet coherence analysis between climate oscillations and evaporation during the 1950 2015 period underscored their increasing influence particularly amo pdo and nao on the annual evaporation cycle since the mid 1980s fig 8 a b and s9a b d significant interannual coherences between amo nino 3 4 and evaporation were also manifested between the mid 1980s and 2000s fig s9a c as well as a near decadal one between nao and evaporation since the early 1990s fig s9d the associated effects are also reflected in the multiple wavelet coherence analysis fig 8a nevertheless given that the latter coherence between nao and evaporation is relatively recent it has not been detected as statistically significant in the global significance analysis fig 8b note that extensive areas with evidence of higher coherence on fig s9d are mostly out of the cone of influence overall the four climate oscillations approximately account for 52 of the variance in the evaporation time series with amo and pdo having the greatest contribution table 1 wavelet power spectral analysis for the reconstructed influence of climate oscillations on evaporation showed a significant 1 yr fluctuation cycle in the late 1950s which re emerged in the late 1970s and again since the mid 1980s with increasing wavelet power fig 8c given the limited length of the evaporation time series i e from 1950 to 2015 coherence and wavelet spectral analyses of interdecadal periodicities were not possible wavelet power spectra for the residual evaporation time series reflecting the potential impact of regional scale processes suggest a significant annual evaporation cycle throughout the study period fig 8d the latter persistence of high wavelet powers for the residual evaporation annual cycle with cwt analysis is also manifested as discernible annual fluctuations in monthly values of total and residual evaporation see gray dotted lines in fig 8e and g the increased influence of climate oscillations on the 1 yr reconstructed evaporation cycle since the mid 1980s fig 8c can also be seen by the corresponding time series gray dotted line in fig 8f 4 discussion considering the profound economic implications of extreme water levels in the great lakes the influence of global climate oscillations on the hydrological cycle and wlfs has received a great deal of attention cohn and robinson 1975 polderman and pryor 2004 gronewold and stow 2014 hanrahan et al 2014 watras et al 2014 nevertheless the focal point of previous studies has been on pairwise relationships between individual climate oscillations and hydrological variables of interest without explicit consideration of the likelihood of confounding effects by the rest predictors to address this knowledge gap our analysis used a two pronged wavelet coherence framework to account for the non orthogonality among multiple climate oscillations before assessing their direct impacts on variables pertaining to the water budget in doing so we were able to discern patterns of significant covariance among the large scale climate oscillations which can in turn magnify offset their individual effects on the hydrological cycle and lake water levels given also the documented disparity among the current coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 cmip3 and phase 5 cmip5 climate models regarding the atmospheric teleconnection changes from region to region shah et al 2022 the results of the present study are highly relevant for the long term planning of the shoreline against the implications of water level variability recent cwt and wavelet coherence analysis signified the presence of 1 8 12 and 36 yr wlf periodicities in lhm between 1860 and 2015 cheng et al 2021 the same study highlighted the role of runoff and evaporation as the primary predictors for seasonal variability of monthly water level differential followed by precipitation river inflows and outflows building upon these findings the present analysis revealed an increasing influence of climate oscillations on the annual precipitation and evaporation cycles since the late 1970s the emergence of high wavelet power for the decadal inflow cycle after the 1980s the gradual dissipation of interdecadal runoff cycle just after the 1970s followed by the emergence of high wavelet power for a near decadal runoff cycle which could have collectively led to the establishment of a near decadal 12 yr wlf cycle in lhm these findings underscore the increasing influence of large scale climate oscillations on the regional hydrologic budget since the early 1980s our coherence analysis suggests that amo pdo and nino3 4 have primarily influenced the interannual to near decadal wlf oscillations nearly anti phase relationships fig 3a c while nao has shaped the interdecadal climate oscillations a nearly in phase relationship in fig 3d also compare the 5 yr moving averages in fig 4c and s10 given the influence of precipitation on runoff and river inflows within a basin reconstructing the impacts of climate oscillations on precipitation variability can improve our predictive capacity of lake water levels in this regard the establishment of a 36 yr precipitation cycle fig 5a and s11 primarily due to nao fig 5b and s3 in the early 1940s followed by its amplification due to the synergistic influence of nino3 4 in the 1960s fig s3 is suggestive of a clear causal linkage between climate oscillations and long term precipitation trends the above average precipitation in 1940s and later in 1970s due to the influence of the 36 yr climate driven precipitation cycle fig s11 triggered increased runoff fig 7e and inflows fig 6e to the lake resulting in a marked increase of lake water levels during the corresponding periods fig 4c likewise below average precipitations in the late 1980s and 1990s fig s11 gradually reduced the lake water levels fig 4c considering that the latest peak of the 36 yr climate driven precipitation cycle occurred in 2010 fig s11 above average precipitation was expected to occur until approximately the end of the 2010s inducing elevated lake water levels and will likely be followed by reduced precipitations after 2020 thereby creating conditions conducive to reduced water levels evaporation typically displays strong annual periodicity and can distinctly shape the water budget seasonality but its impact on wlfs at interannual scales is typically considered minimal cheng et al 2021 nevertheless if we inspect the monthly evaporation data we can infer that gradual shifts occur in the seasonal hydrological cycle over the past few decades for example the average over lake evaporation between june and october has increased by 3 31 mm since 1986 fig s12 and the same trend holds for the annual over lake evaporation minima with a statistically significant increase of 0 17 mm year 1 fig s13 warmer temperatures have also resulted in a statistically significant decrease of the maximum lake ice cover by 0 55 per year since 1974 fig s14 the latter trends could also have important implications for winter evaporation see also deviations of the evaporation in february from the global mean fig s12 when the highest rates occur largely owing to unstable air conditions generated by lake water temperatures higher than air temperatures javed et al 2019 shah et al 2022 comparisons of monthly runoff values between 1915 and 1986 and 1987 2015 show a statistically significant runoff increase during late fall and winter months november february and in contrast a distinct decrease in the spring march may fig s15 hence it could be inferred that precipitation during late fall to winter may have gradually shifted from snow to rain and consequently reduced the magnitude of the spring freshet these results are consistent with recent findings in the area that report an increase in the minimum annual winter air temperature in southern and central ontario since the 1950s javed et al 2019 shah et al 2022 leading to the prevalence of more frequent conditions of rain precipitation during the cold season in the great lakes basin modelling work has suggested that surface runoff may change from a bimodal delivery pattern quiescent period followed by intense spring freshet in cold winters to an intermittent water export during warm winters reflective of a meteorological forcing and subsequent tributary response observed during any other time of the year while these predictions are corroborated by recent empirical evidence other hypotheses further suggest that elevated winter air temperature could increase surface permeability as opposed to an impermeable frozen surface resulting in a greater potential for infiltration and or groundwater recharge and thus creating conditions that are not necessarily conducive to an increase in runoff and or erosion javed et al 2019 shah et al 2022 even more so recent evidence suggests that the aforementioned gradual shifts of the hydrological cycle can be further amplified by short term weather variations in the form of more intense precipitation events although the granularity of our analysis is not sufficient to consolidate trends in hydrologic extremes the nonstationary conditions arising from climate change may facilitate aberrant weather conditions by magnifying the severity of within season droughts altering seasonal evapotranspiration increasing the intensity of 30 min or 24 hr storms and ultimately leading to episodes of excessive runoff and flooding especially in urbanized settings shah et al 2022 5 conclusions the present study offered insights into the evolution of quasi state and non stationary fluctuations in lmh s water budget variables and disentangled the impact of teleconnections of climate oscillations from basin scale hydrological processes in the great lakes region our results indicated that the effects of climate oscillations on lake water budget are mostly registered at inter annual to inter decadal scales specifically in reconstructing the role of the global climate oscillations we found an increasing influence on the annual precipitation and evaporation cycles an emergence of high wavelet power for the decadal inflow cycle a gradual dissipation of interdecadal runoff cycle followed by the emergence of high wavelet power for a near decadal runoff cycle which could have collectively evolved into a near decadal 12 yr water level fluctuation cycle in lake huron michigan thus consistent with existing predictions and empirical evidence that global warming not only drives thermodynamic changes related to latent and sensible heat transfer but can also change atmospheric circulation patterns our results provide evidence of an increasing influence of the large scale climate oscillations on the regional hydrologic budget over the past few decades after removing the atmospheric teleconnection effects the residual hydrological time series suggest gradual changes in runoff and river flow rates and their relationships with precipitation reflecting the effects of intensifying anthropogenic activities urbanization agriculture flood control on the regional water cycle the identified importance of the teleconnection effects should be factored in alongside the gradual shifts or episodic short term variations in the seasonal hydrological cycle due to climate change or human induced urbanization agriculture changes in the landscape we thus predict that lhm will be subjected to a wider range of water level fluctuations with profound implications for the human environment system equilibrium particularly in the nearshore zone in light of the presented evidence of increased transmissivity of the signals of large scale atmospheric teleconnections along with the recent advancements of our understanding of the hydrologic impacts of urbanization and agriculture we believe the establishment of reliable tools to forecast water level variability is more critical than ever before in this regard given the influence of precipitation on runoff and river inflows the reconstruction of the impacts of climate oscillations on precipitation can improve our predictive capacity of lake wlfs it is important to bear in mind though that any modelling tool should include a margin of safety with the predictive statements drawn to account for the increasing
