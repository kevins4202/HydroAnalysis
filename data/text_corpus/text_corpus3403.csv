17015,the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 has been a public health emergency of international concern although sars cov 2 is considered to be mainly transmitted by inhalation of contaminated droplets and aerosols sars cov 2 is also detected in human feces and to a less extent in urine and in raw wastewaters to date viral rna only suggesting that other routes of infection may exist monitoring sars cov 2 genomes in wastewaters has been proposed as a complementary approach for tracing the dynamics of virus transmission within human population connected to wastewater network the understanding on sars cov 2 transmission through wastewater surveillance the development of epidemic modeling and the evaluation of sars cov 2 transmission from contaminated wastewater are largely limited by our knowledge on viral rna genome persistence and virus infectivity preservation in such an environment using an integrity based rt qpcr assay this study led to the discovery that sars cov 2 rna can persist under several forms in wastewaters which provides important information on the presence of sars cov 2 in raw wastewaters and associated risk assessment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sars cov 2 particle integrity quantification wastewater infectious risk 1 introduction coronaviruses covs belong to coronaviridae a large family of enveloped single stranded positive rna viruses covs are usually considered as moderate pathogens for humans four of them 229e nl63 oc43 hku1 are responsible for seasonal common cold or mild respiratory infections however three novel and highly pathogenic covs recently emerged in human population causing severe zoonotic diseases i e severe acute respiratory syndrome sars peiris et al 2003 middle east respiratory syndrome mers zaki et al 2012 and more recently coronavirus disease 19 covid 19 sars cov 2 the etiological agent of covid 19 huang et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 is responsible for a pandemic that caused more than 400 million cases and nearly 3 million deaths so far john hopkins university data by april 13 2021 although sars cov 2 transmission mainly occurs by direct transmission through inhalation of contaminated respiratory droplets aerosols or surfaces world health organization 2020a the potential for alternative transmission pathway should be investigated indeed large amounts of viral rna have been identified in human stools from infected patients presenting with severe covid 19 symptoms which occasionally led to the isolation of infectious virus from feces chen et al 2020 holshue et al 2020 huang et al 2020 lescure et al 2020 pan et al 2020 tang et al 2020 wang et al 2020 wölfel et al 2020 wu et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 sars cov 2 can also be detected in stools from asymptomatic pre and mild symptomatic carriers with a largely unknown prevalence du et al 2020 park et al 2020 this may reflect sars cov 2 replication in the gut luz et al 2020 accordingly high levels of viral rna have been detected in wastewaters in different countries and potential cases of transmission via wastewater have been reported yeo et al 2020a yuan et al 2020 in addition to the risk of exposure for sewage workers wastewaters containing potentially infectious sars cov 2 may enter the aquatic environment via wastewater discharge thus potentially resulting in pollution of surface waters kumar et al 2021 2020 naddeo and liu 2020 rimoldi et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020a and to a lesser extent groundwaters even if infectious sars cov 2 were not able to be isolated from wastewater on cell culture rimoldi et al 2020 such a pollution by infectious viruses could locally affect the quality of water resources used for the production of water intended to human consumption moreover the detection of sars cov 2 genome in treated effluents of wastewater treatment plant could cause problems for agricultural activities through the reuse of treated wastewater or the spreading of sludge if the virus could remained partially infectious or if its infectivity could not be evaluated balboa et al 2021 consequently the contamination of wastewater by sars cov 2 could raise the same concerns as human seasonal enteric viruses okoh et al 2010 the monitoring of sars cov 2 genomes in raw wastewater was successfully used for estimating the dynamics of viral pandemic in population linked to a wastewater network medema et al 2020 nemudryi et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 sebastien wurtzer et al 2020 however many questions remain to be answered to better assess the risk of transmission of sars cov 2 through wastewaters elsamadony et al 2021 lodder and de roda husman 2020 indeed rt qpcr protocoles that are currently used can not distinguish between partial or full length virion associated or free viral genomes prevost et al 2016 it is commonly admitted that enveloped viruses are less persistent in hydric matrices and less resistant to inactivation treatments than naked viruses world health organization 2020b gundy and collaborators showed that human seasonal coronavirus survival in tap water and wastewater was strongly reduced compared to poliovirus the survival ranged from days to weeks depending on the virus type of water and temperature casanova et al 2009 casanova and weaver 2015 gundy et al 2009 an experimental study showed that sars cov 1 stability under an infectious form was only 2 days at 20 c but 14 days at 4 c wang et al 2005 so far only a few studies investigated sars cov 2 stability on solid surfaces chin et al 2020 van doremalen et al 2020 or in water matrix bivins et al 2020 while the decay of sars cov 2 infectivity appears to be different according to the nature of matrix these studies reported an important impact of the heat on the virus infectivity moreover they suggested that sars cov 2 could be more persistent than other coronaviruses seasonal and epidemic cov and more resistant in environmental conditions such as temperature humidity sunlight exposure or on various surfaces aboubakr et al 2020 van doremalen et al 2020 conversely risk assessment for sars cov 2 was mainly based on results obtained for other coronaviruses or for sars cov 2 surrogates enteric viruses or bacteriophage indicators rosa et al 2020 silverman and boehm 2020 ye et al 2016 so far despite the presence of sars cov 2 rna in raw wastewaters no infectious virus was isolated from the same samples suggesting that the detection of viral rna overestimated the risk of infection or resulting from methodological limitations for cultivating sars cov 2 on cell culture from such samples rimoldi et al 2020 the present work intended to evaluate sars cov 2 stability both under an infectious form or by quantifying viral rna in wastewaters we first demonstrated that sars cov 2 rna can be quantified without significant loss in wastewaters samples for up to 7 days at 4 c or 20 c suggesting that viral rna is largely protected from environmental degradation this led us to combine cell culture isolation and integrity based rt qpcr assay to investigate the status of viral rna in wastewater samples prevost et al 2016 we propose that sars cov 2 genomes can exist under three different states at least genomic rna protected within an infectious particle genomic rna protected in a non infectious structure free total or partial genomic rna sars cov 2 persistence and integrity were compared to an enteric virus coxsackievirus b5 that is commonly found in feces and wastewater the analysis of 87 raw wastewater samples collected from april to july 2020 in paris area confirmed that total viral rna can be detected under both a protected and an unprotected form 2 material and methods 2 1 virus stock preparation coxsackievirus b5 cv b5 atcc vr 185 was cultivated on confluent monolayer cultures of buffalo

for 1 hour at 4 c using a xpn80 coulter beckman ultracentrifuge equipped with a swing rotor sw41ti viral pellets were resuspended in 200μl of pbs 1x buffer as previsouly described wurtzer et al 2020 2 3 spiking assays five raw wastewater samples were collected in july 2020 in different wwtp and scored negative for sars cov 2 and enterovirus detection by rt qpcr these 24h old samples were centrifugated at 4 000 xg for 15min for removing the largest particles and supernatants were filtered through membrane with 0 45µm porosity low protein binding durapore membrane slhvm25ns millex germany the filtrates were stored at 4 c and used within the following 24h cv b5 or sars cov 2 were spiked in the filtrated samples virus titration was immediately done after spiking or after incubation at 4 c or 20 c for the indicated period of time as a control spiking experiments were done in dmem virus infectivity virus integrity and viral rna detection were assessed after incubation by endpoint dilution assay pmaxx treatment coupled to rt qpcr and rt qpcr respectively 2 4 virus quantification by endpoint dilution assay infectious viruses cv b5 and sars cov 2 were titrated by standard 10 fold dilutions in 96 well plates on vero e6 cells atcc crl 1586 105 cells per well with twelve replicates per dilution after a 6 day incubation cytopathic effects were observed and

removal kit zymoresearch according the manufacturer s instructions for handling larger volumes 2 6 3 viral rna titration the oligonucleotides and amplification conditions used herein have been previously described by corman al for the detection of sars cov 2 genome corman et al 2020 and by wurtzer al for the detection of enterovirus genome wurtzer et al 2014 the amplifications were done using fast virus 1 step master mix 4x lifetechnologies detection and quantification were carried on the gene e for sars cov 2 and 5 utr for enterovirus positive results for sars cov 2 were confirmed by amplification of viral rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp ip4 set world health organization 2020c and nucleoprotein n1 set genes center for disease control and prevention 2020 an internal positive control ipc was added to evaluate the presence of residual inhibitors the ipc consists in a plasmid containing beta acting gene flanked by enterovirus specific primers wurtzer et al 2014 briefly a sample was considered as inhibited when the cq of ipc was increased by at least 2 cycles this value corresponded to 2xsd of the cq value in control condition the detection limit was estimated to be around 10 genome units per amplification reaction the quantification was performed using a standard curve based on full length amplicon cloned into pcr2 1 plasmid invitrogen 452640 amplification reaction and fluorescence detection were performed on viia7 real time pcr system lifetechnologies 2 7 statistical analysis and plots all statistical analysis and plots were done using graphpad prism 9 0 software for comparison based on spiked samples fig 2 the quantifications were compared between the different conditions using one way anova and tukey s multiple comparisons test comparisons between total viral rna vrna measured by rt qpcr and protected rna prna measured by pmaxx rt qpcr fig 4a were performed using wilcoxson matched pair test and comparisons of ratio prna vrna fig 4b were tested using kruskal wallis test and dunn s multiple comparisons test 3 results 3 1 stability of total viral rna vrna in wastewater samples the quantification of sars cov 2 genome highlights the importance to provide convenient tools to distinguish free viral rna and virion associated rna as a first approach to evaluate the concentration of infectious virus particle in matrix from which sars cov 2 is technically difficult to isolate such as stools or wastewaters since viral genomes are protected by viral proteins and surrounded by a cell derived enveloped in infectious particles we assumed that we could distinguish between free and protected viral genomes using an integrity rt qpcr based assay briefly two 100ml raw wastewater samples were collected by the 3rd sample s1 and the 7th sample s2 of april 2020 in greater paris area a period when sars cov 2 genomes were easily detected wurtzer et al 2020b samples were analyzed less than 24h after the time of the sampling day 0 the rest of each sample was split into 2 parts and stored at 4 c or 20 c for 10 days and 12 days respectively total sars cov 2 viral rna vrna and protected viral rna prna were quantified by rt qpcr and pmaxx rt qpcr respectively as shown on fig 1 less than 10 of the total viral rna was under a protected form sars cov 2 vrna and prna concentrations were relatively stable for 7 s1 and 12 s2 days respectively at 4 c while they were slighly less stable when stored at 20 c as control of pmaxx pretreatment efficacy 6 raw wastewater samples negative for sars cov 2 genome by rt qpcr were collected half was autoclaved at 121 c for 20 minutes eleven milliliters were concentrated by ultracentrifugation as previously described wurtzer et al 2020 and all concentrates 200µl were immediately seeded using the same quantity of sars cov 2 rna purified from cell culture surpernatant and stored on ice concentrates were incubated with pmaxx and sars cov 2 rna genomes were detected according to the described protocol purified rna was strongly and quickly degraded in raw wastewater samples whereas it was detected in autoclaved samples as expected the pmaxx pretreatment induced a strong reduction of rna detection 3 log in autoclaved samples p 0 01 for detection of both e and rdrp genes supplementary data rna reduction was also significantly observed in raw samples when rna input remained sufficient for being assessed 3 2 comparing coxsackievirus b5 and sars cov 2 persistence in raw wastewater infectious enteric viruses are commonly found in wastewaters but the ability of enveloped virus like sars cov 2 to persist under an infectious form is still debated to address this question the persistence of sars cov 2 in raw wastewater was compared to that of coxsackievirus b5 cv b5 using three different indicators namely the quantification of vrna prna and infectious particles tcid50 five raw wastewater samples that were negative for sars cov 2 and enterovirus genome by rt qpcr data not shown were used the detection of infectious virus vrna and prna was performed after spiking each sample with infectious sars cov 2 or cv b5 cv b5 vrna and prna were quantified at similar concentrations in raw wastewaters ww or in cell culture medium dmem when analysis was done immediately after spiking control or after 24h incubation at 4 c or 20 c fig 2a b this result was expected since cv b5 particles were purified to homogeneity on sucrose gradient which efficiently separates encapsidated rna from free rna infectivity of cv b5 was not significantly altered after 24h incubation at 4 c while it only sightly decreased 1 log after a 24h incubation at 20 c fig 2c one ww sample dramatically affected the virus infectivity 2 log the significance could not be statistically assessed strikingly prna was only 10 of total vrna for sars cov 2 suggesting that unpurified sars cov 2 preparation contains only a minor part of intact particles this result was further confirmed by the relatively low level of the infectivity of the viral stock fig 2f as before prna was highly stable whereas sars cov 2 total vrna partly decreased over time in all conditions fig 2d and e as importantly sars cov 2 infectivity was strongly 3 log or moderately 1 log reduced in 3 out of 5 ww samples and 2 over 5 samples respectively the decrease in tcid50 was about 1 log in all samples after a 24h incubation at 4 c since no similar observation was made on samples containing dmem this suggested that sars cov 2 infectivity is strongly reduced in wastewaters likely depending of their chemical and or microbial composition fig 2f 3 3 temperature based inactivation revealed different status for viral rna temperature is known to affect viruses in the environment albeit to very different extent bertrand et al 2012 heat inactivation is commonly used for studying virus survival in water in low temperature range 50 c the inactivation of naked viruses mainly comes from the denaturation of capsids waldman et al 2020 2017 however little is known concerning enveloped viruses therefore we intended to evaluate more precisely the effect of temperature on sars cov 2 using cv b5 as a control for this purpose we first exposed samples spiked with infectious sars cov 2 and cv b5 to increasing temperature for 10 minutes then we evaluated the effect of the treatment on infectious particles or total rna stability vrna viral genome protection was evaluated as before by an integrity rt qpcr based assay prna cv b5 infectivity was preserved up to 42 c and then dramatically decreased up to 70 c as previously described by waldman and co authors waldman et al 2017 prna and vrna were stable up to 50 and 70 c respectively in culture medium although prna decreased at a lower temperature in wastewater fig 3a in the same conditions sars cov 2 viability was not significantly affected until 42 c a marked reduction in infectivity was observed both in wastewaters and culture medium that was not related with a decrease in vrna nor prna fig 3b in both culture medium and wastewater samples reduction of vrna paralleled prna reduction although reduction in vrna and prna was stronger in wastewater sample altogether all these experiments indicated that sars cov 2 viral genomes could exist under three different forms at least protected within infectious particles protected within non infectious particles or in a ribonucleoprotein complex and as free unprotected viral rna 3 4 estimating the relative proportion of protected vs unprotected sars cov 2 genomes in raw wastewater total and protected viral rna were quantified in 87 raw wastewater samples that were collected from april to july 2020 in greater paris area vrna and prna concentrations ranged from 1 4 103 to 5 2 106 gu l and from 0 7 103 to 1 8 106 gu l respectively fig 4a total viral rna were significantly higher than protected rna in each sample p 0 0001 the prna vrna ratio was comprised between 0 and 100 with a median value of 20 1 in wastewater samples with vrna concentrations 100 000 n 39 and 100 000 gu l n 22 the median ratio was 29 6 max 99 3 and 28 1 max 100 respectively this ratio was significantly lower in samples with low genome concentration n 26 10 000 gu l median ratio 0 max 18 8 compared to 100 000 gu l and 100 000 gu l samples p 0 015 and p 0 006 respectively fig 4b 4 discussion wastewater based epidemiology has been widely used over the world for monitoring the spreading of sars cov 2 ahmed et al 2020a medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020 in human populations as well as other waterborne viruses such as poliovirus world health organization 2003 and other enteric viruses prevost et al 2015 a large panel of methods has been developed with various performances sars cov 2 is detected in the feces of about 50 of infected people mainly with no or moderate symptoms lescure et al 2020 pan et al 2020 tang et al 2020 it has been proposed that the presence of sars cov 2 genomes in raw wastewater could reflect the virus excreted by infected people whether they are symptomatic or not it is of upmost importance to confirm this assumption in order to propose mathematical models that could correlate viral load in wastewaters with other individual epidemiological parameters modeling viral dynamics greatly depends on the quality of the analysis but also on the half life of total viral rna in raw wastewater in this study we showed that total viral rna vrna concentration in raw wastewater was stable for at least 7 days provided that the samples were stored at 4 c until analysis which is in agreement with previous work bivins et al 2020 ahmed and coworkers reported a comparable decrease of vrna over 7 days about 0 6 log and 1 3 log at 4 c and 25 c respectively in seeded raw wastewaters ahmed et al 2020b importantly freezing water samples had a negative impact on the relevance of the measurement data not shown at least in our protocol such a delay is important to be taken into consideration to organize campaigns from the sampling to the analysis including transportation to specialized laboratories although our study was performed on a limited number of samples the results suggested that vrna concentration was not dramatically affected by the composition of wastewater samples over 24h incubation time a period of time that is compatible with the travel of the viral genomes from emission of human feces to raw wastewater sampling at the inlet of wwtp as importantly sars cov 2 vrna detection was unaffected in a range of temperature comprised between 4 c and at least 40 c altogether these results suggested that the measurement of sars cov 2 vrna concentration in wastewater is a relevant indicator of the effective level of the viral genomes excreted by infected people that is only moderately affected by temperature and travel time the detection of sars cov 2 genomes in stools and subsequently in wastewaters raises several other important concerns concerning the risk of transmission rt qpcr assays have been designed to detect specific regions of the viral genomes whatever the quantified rna is extracted from infectious particle or not therefore these approaches provide an obvious overestimate of the effective concentration of infectious viral particles within stools and wastewaters even though sewage is an unsanitary environment for many reasons sewers and operators of wastewater treatment plant worried about the occupational risk of infection by sars cov 2 as recently underlined by who world health organization 2020a sars cov 2 is a respiratory virus whose main routes of transmission are respiratory inhalation of contaminated droplets and aerosols and contact with contaminated surfaces however if sars cov 2 infection via contaminated wastewater was not unambiguously demonstrated this possibility cannot be ruled out yeo et al 2020b to that respect let us note that genetic evidences and case clustering led yuan and coworkers to suggest that sewage may be a possible transmission vehicle for sars cov 2 gormley 2020 kang et al 2020 yuan et al 2020 enveloped viruses were commonly thought to be less resistant than naked viruses due to the possible presence of detergent and other chemical agents that may degrade viral envelop raw wastewater might be highly detrimental to the persistence of infectious sars cov 2 particles trials have been done unsuccessfully in order to isolate and cultivate sars cov 2 from fresh wastewater samples rimoldi et al 2020 meaning that sars cov 2 might be simply non infectious or that cell culture system was not adapted for such highly chemically or microbiologically contaminated samples cashdollar and wymer 2013 efforts for concentrating and isolating infectious viruses from hydric environment are usually successful for naked virus that are less sensitive to chemicals in this study infectious sars cov 2 was spiked in negative wastewater samples and viable viruses were quantified up to 24 hours without pretreatment of sample before cultivation whereas such an exposure only mildly affected coxsackievirus b5 viability sars cov 2 infectivity was clearly affected at 20 c depending on the nature of the sample these results are in agreement with previous work bivins et al 2020 we brought here additional evidences that sample temperature had a strong impact on virus viability since the sars cov 2 infectivity was not significantly modified at 4 c for 24h whereas it is slightly affected at 20 c both viruses infectivity was fully preserved up to 42 c for shorter incubation times 10min in all conditions infectious virus persisted up to 24 hours at least in wastewater samples previous studies reported that infectious sars cov 2 could persist for up to 28 days on various supports glass plastic or stainless steel for example riddell et al 2020 van doremalen et al 2020 an effect of temperature on viral infectivity was already reported when virus was adsorbed on solid surfaces riddell et al 2020 or in transportation medium chin et al 2020 more recently bivins and collaborators brought first elements to evaluate sars cov 2 viability in wastewaters and provided evidences that sars cov 2 viral rna persisted for longer period of time than infectious particles bivins et al 2020 the present study confirmed that evaluating total vrna widely overestimated the number of infectious particles within wastewaters nevertheless the relatively long persistence of sars cov 2 genomes was surprising with regards to its supposed fragility compared to surrogates whether the regions that are amplified by rt qpcr came from total or partial genomes cannot be assessed by such assays a tool for assessing the integrity of naked virus particles already showed that genome of naked rna viruses can be protected from degradation by the capsid a structure that remains non permeable to intercalating dye our comparative study on sars cov 2 and cv b5 demonstrated that viral genomes can be found in multiple states i e infectious protected non infectious protected and unprotected forms unpublished data and a recent study showed that such dyes ethidium monoazide or propidium monoazide targeted secondary structures within single stranded rna hairpins or ires for picornaviruses puente et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2018 in addition previous study showed that capsid integrity is lost at 42 c for cv b5 with a maximum access of sybr green ii to viral rna at 50 c waldman et al 2017 in the case of coronaviruses a lipid layer protects the rna genome that is closely associated to nucleoproteins the lipid layer is probably very labile in wastewater which may contain detergent residues for example and unstable at high temperature nonetheless integrity measurements showed that vrna remained protected from intercalating dye up to 70 c incubation in wastewater and up to 90 c in control condition these results suggested other structures such as viral nucleoriboproteic complex resulting from strong interactions between nucleoproteins and viral rna may limit access of the dye to sars cov 2 rna in addition to the viral envelop purified rna without nucleoproteins was shortly degraded in raw wastewater confirming the role of ribonucleoproteic complex in the persistence of sars cov 2 rna it is to note that sars cov 2 and cv b5 shared a similar profil of sensitivity to temperature although sars cov 2 genome appeared to be better protected than cv b5 genomes this assay was used on a large panel of samples confirming that less than 30 of the viral genomes on the average were under a protected form in wastewater samples randazzo and colleagues have proposed to add a surfactant for improving the efficiency of pmaxx pretreatment in wastewater samples puente et al 2020 randazzo et al 2018 our estimation of viral genome protected in wastewater could be further refined considering that infectious particles correspond only to a subfraction of protected genomes as illustrated by spiking experiments it can be considered that risk assement for viral infection through wastewaters should be better evaluated using an integrity based assay if systematic cell culture isolation cannot be done the results suggested also that the infectious risk could be mitigated by heat exposure encountered during the sludge hygienization for example such a technique could also be used to evaluate the relative fraction of protected genomes in other matrix such as in sputums or stools of infected patients or for other enveloped viruses such as influenza virus chan et al 2009 hirose 2016 5 conclusion sars cov 2 rna genome quantification in raw wastewaters has been proposed as an efficient way to monitor the dynamics of covid 19 within populations however the detection of sars cov 2 rna genomes by rt qpcr in raw wastewaters raises important questions concerning sars cov 2 stability and risk assessment using an integrity based rt qpcr the present results demonstrated that sars cov 2 genomes can be found in three different states in wastewater at least i e infectious protected non infectious protected and non protected forms evidences show that some protected forms are associated with the long term persistence of viral rna in wastewaters which may have important consequences for risk assessment since conventional rt qpcr largely overestimated the presence of infectious viruses the present study demonstrated that integrity based rt qpcr would allow to better estimate the risk of contamination through wastewaters in addition it may also be useful to detect viral particles in other complex matrices such as sludges and stools in which isolating infectious viruses is often technically challenging authors

al 2020 park et al 2020 this may reflect sars cov 2 replication in the gut luz et al 2020 accordingly high levels of viral rna have been detected in wastewaters in different countries and potential cases of transmission via wastewater have been reported yeo et al 2020a yuan et al 2020 in addition to the risk of exposure for sewage workers wastewaters containing potentially infectious sars cov 2 may enter the aquatic environment via wastewater discharge thus potentially resulting in pollution of surface waters kumar et al 2021 2020 naddeo and liu 2020 rimoldi et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020a and to a lesser extent groundwaters even if infectious sars cov 2 were not able to be isolated from wastewater on cell culture rimoldi et al 2020 such a pollution by infectious viruses could locally affect the quality of water resources used for the production of water intended to human consumption moreover the detection of sars cov 2 genome in treated effluents of wastewater treatment plant could cause problems for agricultural activities through the reuse of treated wastewater or the spreading of sludge if the virus could remained partially infectious or if its infectivity could not be evaluated balboa et al 2021 consequently the contamination of wastewater by sars cov 2 could raise the same concerns as human seasonal enteric viruses okoh et al 2010 the monitoring of sars cov 2 genomes in raw wastewater was successfully used for estimating the dynamics of viral pandemic in population linked to a wastewater network medema et al 2020 nemudryi et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 sebastien wurtzer et al 2020 however many questions remain to be answered to better assess the risk of transmission of sars cov 2 through wastewaters elsamadony et al 2021 lodder and de roda husman 2020 indeed rt qpcr protocoles that are currently used can not distinguish between partial or full length virion associated or free viral genomes prevost et al 2016 it is commonly admitted that enveloped viruses are less persistent in hydric matrices and less resistant to inactivation treatments than naked viruses world health organization 2020b gundy and collaborators showed that human seasonal coronavirus survival in tap water and wastewater was strongly reduced compared to poliovirus the survival ranged from days to weeks depending on the virus type of water and temperature casanova et al 2009 casanova and weaver 2015 gundy et al 2009 an experimental study showed that sars cov 1 stability under an infectious form was only 2 days at 20 c but 14 days at 4 c wang et al 2005 so far only a few studies investigated sars cov 2 stability on solid surfaces chin et al 2020 van doremalen et al 2020 or in water matrix bivins et al 2020 while the decay of sars cov 2 infectivity appears to be different according to the nature of matrix these studies reported an important impact of the heat on the virus infectivity moreover they suggested that sars cov 2 could be more persistent than other coronaviruses seasonal and epidemic cov and more resistant in environmental conditions such as temperature humidity sunlight exposure or on various surfaces aboubakr et al 2020 van doremalen et al 2020 conversely risk assessment for sars cov 2 was mainly based on results obtained for other coronaviruses or for sars cov 2 surrogates enteric viruses or bacteriophage indicators rosa et al 2020 silverman and boehm 2020 ye et al 2016 so far despite the presence of sars cov 2 rna in raw wastewaters no infectious virus was isolated from the same samples suggesting that the detection of viral rna overestimated the risk of infection or resulting from methodological limitations for cultivating sars cov 2 on cell culture from such samples rimoldi et al 2020 the present work intended to evaluate sars cov 2 stability both under an infectious form or by quantifying viral rna in wastewaters we first demonstrated that sars cov 2 rna can be quantified without significant loss in wastewaters samples for up to 7 days at 4 c or 20 c suggesting that viral rna is largely protected from environmental degradation this led us to combine cell culture isolation and integrity based rt qpcr assay to investigate the status of viral rna in wastewater samples prevost et al 2016 we propose that sars cov 2 genomes can exist under three different states at least genomic rna protected within an infectious particle genomic rna protected in a non infectious structure free total or partial genomic rna sars cov 2 persistence and integrity were compared to an enteric virus coxsackievirus b5 that is commonly found in feces and wastewater the analysis of 87 raw wastewater samples collected from april to july 2020 in paris area confirmed that total viral rna can be detected under both a protected and an unprotected form 2 material and methods 2 1 virus stock preparation coxsackievirus b5 cv b5 atcc vr 185 was cultivated on confluent monolayer cultures of buffalo

for 1 hour at 4 c using a xpn80 coulter beckman ultracentrifuge equipped with a swing rotor sw41ti viral pellets were resuspended in 200μl of pbs 1x buffer as previsouly described wurtzer et al 2020 2 3 spiking assays five raw wastewater samples were collected in july 2020 in different wwtp and scored negative for sars cov 2 and enterovirus detection by rt qpcr these 24h old samples were centrifugated at 4 000 xg for 15min for removing the largest particles and supernatants were filtered through membrane with 0 45µm porosity low protein binding durapore membrane slhvm25ns millex germany the filtrates were stored at 4 c and used within the following 24h cv b5 or sars cov 2 were spiked in the filtrated samples virus titration was immediately done after spiking or after incubation at 4 c or 20 c for the indicated period of time as a control spiking experiments were done in dmem virus infectivity virus integrity and viral rna detection were assessed after incubation by endpoint dilution assay pmaxx treatment coupled to rt qpcr and rt qpcr respectively 2 4 virus quantification by endpoint dilution assay infectious viruses cv b5 and sars cov 2 were titrated by

extracted as follow 2 6 viral rna detection 2 6 1 spiking assays the spiked samples were lysed by adding two volumes of trizol lifetechnologies and extracted using qiasymphony dsp pathogen kit on a

previously described by corman al for the detection of sars cov 2 genome corman et al 2020 and by wurtzer al for the detection of enterovirus genome wurtzer et al 2014 the amplifications were done using fast virus 1 step master mix 4x lifetechnologies detection and quantification were carried on the gene e for sars cov 2 and 5 utr for enterovirus positive results for sars cov 2 were confirmed by amplification of viral rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp ip4 set world health organization 2020c and nucleoprotein n1 set genes center for disease control and prevention 2020 an internal positive control ipc was added to evaluate the presence of residual inhibitors the ipc consists in a plasmid containing beta acting gene flanked by enterovirus specific primers wurtzer et al 2014 briefly a sample was considered as inhibited when the cq of ipc was increased by at least 2 cycles this value corresponded to 2xsd of the cq value in control condition the detection limit was estimated to be around 10 genome units per amplification reaction the quantification was performed using a standard curve based on full length amplicon cloned into pcr2 1 plasmid invitrogen 452640 amplification reaction and fluorescence detection were performed on viia7 real time pcr system lifetechnologies 2 7 statistical analysis and plots all statistical analysis and plots were done using graphpad prism 9 0 software for comparison based on spiked samples fig 2 the quantifications were compared between the different conditions using one way anova and tukey s multiple comparisons test comparisons between total viral rna vrna measured by rt qpcr and protected rna prna measured by pmaxx rt qpcr fig 4a were performed using wilcoxson matched pair test and comparisons of ratio prna vrna fig 4b were tested using kruskal wallis test and dunn s multiple comparisons test 3 results 3 1 stability of total viral rna vrna in wastewater samples the quantification of sars cov 2 genome highlights the importance to provide convenient tools to distinguish free viral rna and virion associated rna as a first approach to evaluate the concentration of infectious virus particle in matrix from which sars cov 2 is technically difficult to isolate such as stools or wastewaters since viral genomes are protected by viral proteins and surrounded by a cell derived enveloped in infectious particles we assumed that we could distinguish between free and protected viral genomes using an integrity rt qpcr based assay briefly two 100ml raw wastewater samples were collected by the 3rd sample s1 and the 7th sample s2 of april 2020 in greater paris area a period when sars cov 2 genomes were easily detected wurtzer et al 2020b samples were analyzed less than 24h after the time of the sampling day 0 the rest of each sample was split into 2 parts and stored at 4 c or 20 c for 10 days and 12 days respectively total sars cov 2 viral rna vrna and protected viral rna prna were quantified by rt qpcr and pmaxx rt qpcr respectively as shown on fig 1 less than 10 of the total viral rna was under a protected form sars cov 2 vrna and prna concentrations were relatively stable for 7 s1 and 12 s2 days respectively at 4 c while they were slighly less stable when stored at 20 c as control of pmaxx pretreatment efficacy 6 raw wastewater samples negative for sars cov 2 genome by rt qpcr were collected half was autoclaved at 121 c for 20 minutes eleven milliliters were concentrated by ultracentrifugation as previously described wurtzer et al 2020 and all concentrates 200µl were immediately seeded using the same quantity of sars cov 2 rna purified from cell culture surpernatant and stored on ice concentrates were incubated with pmaxx and sars cov 2 rna genomes were detected according to the described protocol purified rna was strongly and quickly degraded in raw wastewater samples whereas it was detected in autoclaved samples as expected the pmaxx pretreatment induced a strong reduction of rna detection 3 log in autoclaved samples p 0 01 for detection of both e and rdrp genes supplementary data rna reduction was also significantly observed in raw samples when rna input remained sufficient for being assessed 3 2 comparing coxsackievirus b5 and sars cov 2 persistence in raw wastewater infectious enteric viruses are commonly found in wastewaters but the ability of enveloped virus like sars cov 2 to persist under an infectious form is still debated to address this question the persistence of sars cov 2 in raw wastewater was compared to that of coxsackievirus b5 cv b5 using three different indicators namely the quantification of vrna prna and infectious particles tcid50 five raw wastewater samples that were negative for sars cov 2 and enterovirus genome by rt qpcr data not shown were used the detection of infectious virus vrna and prna was performed after spiking each sample with infectious sars cov 2 or cv b5 cv b5 vrna and prna were quantified at similar concentrations in raw wastewaters ww or in cell culture medium dmem when analysis was done immediately after spiking control or after 24h incubation at 4 c or 20 c fig 2a b this result was expected since cv b5 particles were purified to homogeneity on sucrose gradient which efficiently separates encapsidated rna from free rna infectivity of cv b5 was not significantly altered after 24h incubation at 4 c while it only sightly decreased 1 log after a 24h incubation at 20 c fig 2c one ww sample dramatically affected the virus infectivity 2 log the significance could not be statistically assessed strikingly prna was only 10 of total vrna for sars cov 2 suggesting that unpurified sars cov 2 preparation contains only a minor part of intact particles this result was further confirmed by the relatively low level of the infectivity of the viral stock fig 2f as before prna was highly stable whereas sars cov 2 total vrna partly decreased over time in all conditions fig 2d and e as importantly sars cov 2 infectivity was strongly 3 log or moderately 1 log reduced in 3 out of 5 ww samples and 2 over 5 samples respectively the decrease in tcid50 was about 1 log in all samples after a 24h incubation at 4 c since no similar observation was made on samples containing dmem this suggested that sars cov 2 infectivity is strongly reduced in wastewaters likely depending of their chemical and or microbial composition fig 2f 3 3 temperature based inactivation revealed different status for viral rna temperature is known to affect viruses in the environment albeit to very different extent bertrand et al 2012 heat inactivation is commonly used for studying virus survival in water in low temperature range 50 c the inactivation of naked viruses mainly comes from the denaturation of capsids waldman et al 2020 2017 however little is known concerning enveloped viruses therefore we intended to evaluate more precisely the effect of temperature on sars cov 2 using cv b5 as a control for this purpose we first exposed samples spiked with infectious sars cov 2 and cv b5 to increasing temperature for 10 minutes then we evaluated the effect of the treatment on infectious particles or total rna stability vrna viral genome protection was evaluated as before by an integrity rt qpcr based assay prna cv b5 infectivity was preserved up to 42 c and then dramatically decreased up to 70 c as previously described by waldman and co authors waldman et al 2017 prna and vrna were stable up to 50 and 70 c respectively in culture medium although prna decreased at a lower temperature in wastewater fig 3a in the same conditions sars cov 2 viability was not significantly affected until 42 c a marked reduction in infectivity was observed both in wastewaters and culture medium that was not related with a decrease in vrna nor prna fig 3b in both culture medium and wastewater samples reduction of vrna paralleled prna reduction although reduction in vrna and prna was stronger in wastewater sample altogether all these experiments indicated that sars cov 2 viral genomes could exist under three different forms at least protected within infectious particles protected within non infectious particles or in a ribonucleoprotein complex and as free unprotected viral rna 3 4 estimating the relative proportion of protected vs unprotected sars cov 2 genomes in raw wastewater total and protected viral rna were quantified in 87 raw wastewater samples that were collected from april to july 2020 in greater paris area vrna and prna concentrations ranged from 1 4 103 to 5 2 106 gu l and from 0 7 103 to 1 8 106 gu l respectively fig 4a total viral rna were significantly higher than protected rna in each sample p 0 0001 the prna vrna ratio was comprised between 0 and 100 with a median value of 20 1 in wastewater samples with vrna concentrations 100 000 n 39 and 100 000 gu l n 22 the median ratio was 29 6 max 99 3 and 28 1 max 100 respectively this ratio was significantly lower in samples with low genome concentration n 26 10 000 gu l median ratio 0 max 18 8 compared to 100 000 gu l and 100 000 gu l samples p 0 015 and p 0 006 respectively fig 4b 4 discussion wastewater based epidemiology has been widely used over the world for monitoring the spreading of sars cov 2 ahmed et al 2020a medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020 in human populations as well as other waterborne viruses such as poliovirus world health organization 2003 and other enteric viruses prevost et al 2015 a large panel of methods has been developed with various performances sars cov 2 is detected in the feces of about 50 of infected people mainly with no or moderate symptoms lescure et al 2020 pan et al 2020 tang et al 2020 it has been proposed that the presence of sars cov 2 genomes in raw wastewater could reflect the virus excreted by infected people whether they are symptomatic or not it is of upmost importance to confirm this assumption in order to propose mathematical models that could correlate viral load in wastewaters with other individual epidemiological parameters modeling viral dynamics greatly depends on the quality of the analysis but also on the half life of total viral rna in raw wastewater in this study we showed that total viral rna vrna concentration in raw wastewater was stable for at least 7 days provided that the samples were stored at 4 c until analysis which is in agreement with previous work bivins et al 2020 ahmed and coworkers reported a comparable decrease of vrna over 7 days about 0 6 log and 1 3 log at 4 c and 25 c respectively in seeded raw wastewaters ahmed et al 2020b importantly freezing water samples had a negative impact on the relevance of the measurement data not shown at least in our protocol such a delay is important to be taken into consideration to organize campaigns from the sampling to the analysis including transportation to specialized laboratories although our study was performed on a limited number of samples the results suggested that vrna concentration was not dramatically affected by the composition of wastewater samples over 24h incubation time a period of time that is compatible with the travel of the viral genomes from emission of human feces to raw wastewater sampling at the inlet of wwtp as importantly sars cov 2 vrna detection was unaffected in a range of temperature comprised between 4 c and at least 40 c altogether these results suggested that the measurement of sars cov 2 vrna concentration in wastewater is a relevant indicator of the effective level of the viral genomes excreted by infected people that is only moderately affected by temperature and travel time the detection of sars cov 2 genomes in stools and subsequently in wastewaters raises several other important concerns concerning the risk of transmission rt qpcr assays have been designed to detect specific regions of the viral genomes whatever the quantified rna is extracted from infectious particle or not therefore these approaches provide an obvious overestimate of the effective concentration of infectious viral particles within stools and wastewaters even though sewage is an unsanitary environment for many reasons sewers and operators of wastewater treatment plant worried about the occupational risk of infection by sars cov 2 as recently underlined by who world health organization 2020a sars cov 2 is a respiratory virus whose main routes of transmission are respiratory inhalation of contaminated droplets and aerosols and contact with contaminated surfaces however if sars cov 2 infection via contaminated wastewater was not unambiguously demonstrated this possibility cannot be ruled out yeo et al 2020b to that respect let us note that genetic evidences and case clustering led yuan and coworkers to suggest that sewage may be a possible transmission vehicle for sars cov 2 gormley 2020 kang et al 2020 yuan et al 2020 enveloped viruses were commonly thought to be less resistant than naked viruses due to the possible presence of detergent and other chemical agents that may degrade viral envelop raw wastewater might be highly detrimental to the persistence of infectious sars cov 2 particles trials have been done unsuccessfully in order to isolate and cultivate sars cov 2 from fresh wastewater samples rimoldi et al 2020 meaning that sars cov 2 might be simply non infectious or that cell culture system was not adapted for such highly chemically or microbiologically contaminated samples cashdollar and wymer 2013 efforts for concentrating and isolating infectious viruses from hydric environment are usually successful for naked virus that are less sensitive to chemicals in this study infectious sars cov 2 was spiked in negative wastewater samples and viable viruses were quantified up to 24 hours without pretreatment of sample before cultivation whereas such an exposure only mildly affected coxsackievirus b5 viability sars cov 2 infectivity was clearly affected at 20 c depending on the nature of the sample these results are in agreement with previous work bivins et al 2020 we brought here additional evidences that sample temperature had a strong impact on virus viability since the sars cov 2 infectivity was not significantly modified at 4 c for 24h whereas it is slightly affected at 20 c both viruses infectivity was fully preserved up to 42 c for shorter incubation times 10min in all conditions infectious virus persisted up to 24 hours at least in wastewater samples previous studies reported that infectious sars cov 2 could persist for up to 28 days on various supports glass plastic or stainless steel for example riddell et al 2020 van doremalen et al 2020 an effect of temperature on viral infectivity was already reported when virus was adsorbed on solid surfaces riddell et al 2020 or in transportation medium chin et al 2020 more recently bivins and collaborators brought first elements to evaluate sars cov 2 viability in wastewaters and provided evidences that sars cov 2 viral rna persisted for longer period of time than infectious particles bivins et al 2020 the present study confirmed that evaluating total vrna widely overestimated the number of infectious particles within wastewaters nevertheless the relatively long persistence of sars cov 2 genomes was surprising with regards to its supposed fragility compared to surrogates whether the regions that are amplified by rt qpcr came from total or partial genomes cannot be assessed by such assays a tool for assessing the integrity of naked virus particles already showed that genome of naked rna viruses can be protected from degradation by the capsid a structure that remains non permeable to intercalating dye our comparative study on sars cov 2 and cv b5 demonstrated that viral genomes can be found in multiple states i e infectious protected non infectious protected and unprotected forms unpublished data and a recent study showed that such dyes ethidium monoazide or propidium monoazide targeted secondary structures within single stranded rna hairpins or ires for picornaviruses puente et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2018 in addition previous study showed that capsid integrity is lost at 42 c for cv b5 with a maximum access of sybr green ii to viral rna at 50 c waldman et al 2017 in the case of coronaviruses a lipid layer protects the rna genome that is closely associated to nucleoproteins the lipid layer is probably very labile in wastewater which may contain detergent residues for example and unstable at high temperature nonetheless integrity measurements showed that vrna remained protected from intercalating dye up to 70 c incubation in wastewater and up to 90 c in control condition these results suggested other structures such as viral nucleoriboproteic complex resulting from strong interactions between nucleoproteins and viral rna may limit access of the dye to sars cov 2 rna in addition to the viral envelop purified rna without nucleoproteins was shortly degraded in raw wastewater confirming the role of ribonucleoproteic complex in the persistence of sars cov 2 rna it is to note that sars cov 2 and cv b5 shared a similar profil of sensitivity to temperature although sars cov 2 genome appeared to be better protected than cv b5 genomes this assay was used on a large panel of samples confirming that less than 30 of the viral genomes on the average were under a protected form in wastewater samples randazzo and colleagues have proposed to add a surfactant for improving the efficiency of pmaxx pretreatment in wastewater samples puente et al 2020 randazzo et al 2018 our estimation of viral genome protected in wastewater could be further refined considering that infectious particles correspond only to a subfraction of protected genomes as illustrated by spiking experiments it can be considered that risk assement for viral infection through wastewaters should be better evaluated using an integrity based assay if systematic cell culture isolation cannot be done the results suggested also that the infectious risk could be mitigated by heat exposure encountered during the sludge hygienization for example such a technique could also be used to evaluate the relative fraction of protected genomes in other matrix such as in sputums or stools of infected patients or for other enveloped viruses such as influenza virus chan et al 2009 hirose 2016 5 conclusion sars cov 2 rna genome quantification in raw wastewaters has been proposed as an efficient way to monitor the dynamics of covid 19 within populations however the detection of sars cov 2 rna genomes by rt qpcr in raw wastewaters raises important questions concerning sars cov 2 stability and risk assessment using an integrity based rt qpcr the present results demonstrated that sars cov 2 genomes can be found in three different states in wastewater at least i e infectious protected non infectious protected and non protected forms evidences show that some protected forms are associated with the long term persistence of viral rna in wastewaters which may have important consequences for risk assessment since conventional rt qpcr largely overestimated the presence of infectious viruses the present study demonstrated that integrity based rt qpcr would allow to better estimate the risk of contamination through wastewaters in addition it may also be useful to detect viral particles in other complex matrices such as sludges and stools in which isolating infectious viruses is often technically challenging authors

17016,extracellular polymeric substances eps existent in anaerobic sludge proves to be a barrier for sludge liquefaction and biomass lysis efficiency hence eps deaggregation heightens the surface area for the subsequent pretreatment thereby uplifting the sludge disintegration and biomethanation rate this review documents the role of eps and its components which inhibits sludge hydrolysis and also the various phase separated pretreatment methods available with its disintegration mechanism to enhance the biomass lysis and methane production rate it also illustrates the effects of phase separated pretreatment on the sludge disintegration rate which embodies two phases floc disruption and cell lysis accompanied by their computation through biomethane potential assay and fermentation analysis comprehensively additionally energy balance study and cost analysis requisite for successful implementation of a proposed phase separated pretreatment on a pilot scale level and their challenges are also reviewed overall this paper documents the potency of phase separated pretreatment for full scale approach keywords extracellular polymeric substances biomass lysis biomethane production energy balance cost analysis 1 introduction enormous amount of waste activated sludge was emanating from wastewater treatment plant wwtps are stabilized extensively through aerobic and anaerobic digestion ad here ad is weighed down as a dynamic method considering its green energy recovery in the form of biogas in a profitable manner however hydrolytic and acidogenic phases plays a transitional role in the bioconversion of was to biogas wherein hydrolysis is premeditated as a hindering aspect in ad this warrants an admissible sludge pretreatment method prior to ad which stimulates the sludge disintegration rate kavitha et al 2016a in recent times numerous pretreatment methods have been recorded by legion of researchers such as physical thermal and microwave ebenezer et al 2015a kavitha et al 2018 2016b yan et al 2013 mechanical ultrasonication and disperser banu et al 2018a gayathri et al 2015 kavitha et al 2016c 2016d 2014a chemical acid alkali and ozone banu et al 2012 kannah et al 2017a kavitha et al 2015a advanced oxidation process aop sharmila et al 2017 biological enzyme and microbes kavitha et al 2017b yang et al 2010 kannah et al 2020 and combinative disintegrations banu et al 2018b kannah et al 2017b kavitha et al 2015b 2017a have been employed to augment sludge biodegradation these methods cause a fissure in cell walls of sludge biomass which emancipates the strongly bound organic materials from the cell in house into the aqueous phase soluble extracellular polymeric substance eps existent in sludge matrix plays a vital role in curbing the accessibility of substrates for sludge disintegration whereas release of eps actuates the surface area exposure for the microbial cell disintegration process in a prominent manner merrylin et al 2014 eps are highly composed of extracellular biopolymers such as protein carbohydrates lipid humic and nucleic acids the concentration of biopolymer may vary with respect to certain environmental factors during formation of biosolids eps it act as a protective layer of the intracellular compounds present in the biosolids it forms a complex net structure with plenty of water that reduces biosolids dewatering capacity eps which binds over the surface of biosolids limits the hydrolysis which directly affects the anaerobic biodegradability therefore removal of eps from biosolids prior to ad will be more effective in enhancing the anaerobic biodegradability and biogas yield the anaerobic biodegradability assay is found to be an advantageous method for critical evaluation of biogas production among diverse substrates which gets amplified by an assortment of pretreatment methods available lately packyam et al 2015 on the other hand the eps removal from biosolids significantly reduces pretreatment input energy and accelerates the biosolids liquefaction which indirectly supports the profitable output yield besides the energy demand of a process should be at least counterbalanced by the volume of methane produced which in turn necessitates an energy balance and economic assessment to ascertain the practicability of implementing the pretreatment process in a massive scale therefore extraction of eps prior to sludge pretreatment is found to be imperative in heightening the process efficiency the speed and extent of liquefaction curtailment of cost and also contracts the time consumed during the process kavitha et al 2020a accordingly the two step disintegration phase separation process which consists of floc disintegration fd and cell lysis cl phase conceptualized by tiehm et al 2001 and show et al 2007 was utilized to study the solubilization rate the disruption of floc matrix solubilizes the intercellular organic components and is utilized as substrates by microbes present in sludge biomass and strengthens the sludge pretreatment process the passive hydrolysis of particulate organics in ad caps the disintegration rate of biosolids which necessitates pretreatment process prior to ad an integral function of pretreatment is to agitate the eps matrix thereby ousting the available intercellular components into the aqueous phase thus quickening the organic solids conversion rate and increase the methane productivity volume so far very limited literatures are available reporting phase separated sludge pretreatment process and this review gives an encyclopedic insight of the process this review mainly focus on understanding the mechanism of eps formation and the biopolymer that cause hindrance towards biosolids hydrolysis considering the above facts the review concerning the role of eps in sludge matrix importance of eps removal different techniques employed for eps disruption techno economic aspect of eps removal prior to pretreatment of biosolids were discussed comprehensively 2 extracellular polymeric substances eps in sludge biomass 2 1 role of eps in sludge matrix eps which is a fundamental component in biofilms contributes to about 50 to 80 w w of total biofilms weight which is ascertained through various electron microscopy techniques meng et al 2016 at present a proportionate amount of reviews is available demonstrating the constructive and adverse aspects of eps in sludge biomass which influence the performance of biological wastewater treatment systems salama et al 2016 sheng et al 2010 eps have a paramount impact on the physicochemical properties of sludge biomass such as structure surface charge flocculation settling properties stability adhesion dewatering properties hydrophobicity hydrophilicity and adsorption ability presence of multivalent cations in eps plays an immense role on sludge biomass structure thereby influencing their flocculation rate li et al 2012 eps are amphoteric to certain extent as it embodies profuse amount of charged functional groups and non polar groups e g aromatics aliphatic in proteins and hydrophobic region in polysaccharides besides the hydrophobic regions in eps yields to organic pollutants adsorption as an augmented hydrophobicity in general brings about better flocculation shi et al 2017 the dewatering potentiality of activated sludge was found to improve with an upsurge in eps content owing to its lower shear sensitivity and reduced degree of dispersion on the contrary a magnified eps level was not favorable for substrate mass transfer by virtue of the decrease in permeability of anaerobic sludge granules sheng et al 2010 plus eps are scrutinized as an imperative intermediary in the adhesion of bacteria to the sludge surface in the course of biofilm formation upholding the structural integrity of biofilms and consequently leads to the overall stability of biofilm withal several studies have reported that sludge settling bioflocculation and dewatering properties offers a huge correlation with eps components and its spatial distribution additionally dna and protein contents in eps have an affirmatory relationship with sludge volume index svi in comparison to polysaccharides peng et al 2014 zhang et al 2015a according to spatial distribution eps can be classified depending on the extraction methods as soluble eps and bound eps soluble eps comprises of soluble macromolecules colloids and slimes that can voluntarily move amidst the surrounding liquor and sludge flocs while bound eps comprising capsule polymers gelatin coacervates loose polymers and attached organic compounds firmly adheres to cells and form a discrete cover layer yu etal 2009 the various constituents of soluble and bound eps instigated variation in the metal biosorption activity and organic pollutant binding capacity furthermore bound epss are subdivided into loosely bound epss lb epss and tightly bound epss tb epss which forms a dynamic double layer structure yu et al 2008 tsai et al 2008 found that large molecules mw 20000da in tb eps were protein like substances of high aromaticity which amounted to 22 of the total dissolved organic carbon doc as to lb eps likewise yu et al 2009 reported that the tb eps extracted from sludge displayed huge amount of macromolecules content 330 1200 kda and trivalent cation in comparison to other fractions which delivers larger flocculating rate to kaolin suspensions thus variant eps components demonstrate a specific role which chiefly serves as an influential function of eps and microbial aggregates in a study by zhao et al 2015 lb eps had an outstanding effect on sludge flocculation sludge settling and dewaterability characteristic as to the tb eps and thus improving potentiality of cell cell interactions conjointly nutritional parameters such as c n ratio serve as an influential parameter in the activated sludge systems and have a significant impact on the nature and eps matter present in sludge biomass ye et al 2011 along these lines eps plays a crucial role in sludge granulation and couples cells through ion bridging interaction hydrophobic interaction and polymer entanglement which intensifies the formation of sludge granules sheng et al 2010 concisely eps has a definitive influence on sludge properties and are profoundly interconnected which creates a great impact on the performance of activated sludge systems 2 2 components of extracellular polymers and its hindrance towards hydrolysis sludge biomass is built up of diverse microbes that are susceptible to environmental conditions like temperature organic load etc there by altering the physical chemical and biological properties of activated sludge as for this reason the flocculation mechanisms of as are considered to be complex as to colloidal particles the intermolecular interaction theories such as polymer bridging derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory hydrophobic interactions multivalent bridging theory and steric interactions elucidates the binding of sludge biomass elaborately li and yu 2014 whilst the classical dlvo theory and extended dlvo theory which is based on colloid and surface chemistry illustrates the cell to cell interactions and bio flocculation process it suggests energy assessment owing to the overlying of electric double layers generally repulsion and the vander waals energy typically attraction in terms of inter particle distance additionally lewis acid base interactions were taken into consideration in extended dlvo theory according to this theory sludge cells support one another as they advance closer and cause a decline in the double layer thickness furthermore the repulsion between particles also contracts and thus concedes short range attractive forces to bolster sludge aggregation liu et al 2010 2008 the aforesaid dlvo theory and multivalent bridging theory are strongly associated to cations since multivalent cations can bridge eps and thereby reduces the effect of negative charges on the as surface wilén et al 2008 usually divalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 play a crucial role in bioflocculation process and keeps the cations adhesive to eps in a three dimensional matrix other significant inter particle forces consist of hydrogen bonds thermodynamic forces covalent bonds etc the extended dlvo theory could quantify the non bioparticles still it has a definite application in bioaggregates particularly when eps expulsion influences the cell surface characteristics moreover gelation divalent cation bridging and lectin binding have been extensively probed relative to the mechanism of cell aggregation which are physico chemical interactions involving the production and function of eps ding et al 2015 likewise the hydrophobicity of the cell surface was partially due to the hydrophobic portion of eps macromolecules besides the above mentioned theories accentuate the significance of eps since they stockpile on the cell surface initially and gets engaged in sludge flocs interactions and subsequently used to analyze the physical and chemical characteristics of as typically production of eps by microorganisms seems to occur by diverse mechanisms which is inclusive of secretion degradation cell death and adsorption of environmental substances in wastewater treatment systems sun et al 2016 eps are thus construed as high molecular weight polymers generated by microorganisms that are placed either on microbial cell surfaces or in the enclosing environment the properties of eps components extracted had preeminent impact on certain functions of sludge biomass they have been proclaimed as heterogeneous structure characterized by distinct aspects such as extraction and characterization methods utilized sludge type process parameter culture and growth conditions basuvaraj et al 2015 and fig 1 illustrates the structure and formation of sludge flocs a few researchers have documented that the effect of substrate greatly influences the biosynthesis and composition of eps existent in the surface of biosolids the two major substrates such as carbon source in terms of cod concentration and nitrogen plays an essential role in biosynthesis of eps nouha et al 2018 eps typically consist of proteins polysaccharides humic like substances uronic acids nucleic acids and lipids geyik et al 2016 have reported the difference in concentration of protein and carbohydrates which influences eps hydrophobicity and is correlated with the substrate provided to the microbial communities the greatest part of eps comprises of carbohydrates exo polysaccharides which are chiefly linear or branched long molecules embodies either homo polysaccharides or hetero polysaccharides howbeit most exo polysaccharides found in eps are hetero polysaccharides like glucose mannose and n acetylgalactosamine pertaining to amalgamation of neutral and charged sugar residues further organic or inorganic matter existence alters the physical and biological properties of eps flemming and wingender 2010 distinctively polysaccharide owing to the accretion of few functional groups such as carboxyl ecoo plays a major role in cell aggregation which gets enhanced due to the multivalent ions present in them yin et al 2015 pan et al 2010 have reported that the eps and protein plays a different functional role during formation of biosolids and extraction of eps the eps fills the gap between the biosolids to form stable floc or aggregates the eps matrixes act as a multiuse functional part of microbial communities which includes binding agents protective layer which indicates stability of biosolids and its physiology next to polysaccharides another important extracellular polymers such as protein plays a vital role in the formation of biosolids eps yin et al 2015 according to zhang et al 2015b the concentration of protein in waste activated sludge and anaerobic granular sludge depends on hydrophobic interactions and elevated the aggregation of microbial activity in biosolids the proteins originated from internal and external surface of biosolids has different molecular functions based on their catalytic activity and binding activity the protein found in the outer surface of the biosolids tends to increase the floc binding capacity apart from the authentic form of polysaccharides and proteins those molecules existent in hybrid form in the course of covalent bonds and their configuration and structure have proven to have disseminated effects on the formation and stability of microbial aggregates bourven et al 2015 extracellular dna edna serve as a decisive factor to establish the three dimensional structure of biofilms thereby providing structural integrity to the eps matrix also it clouted the zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter of bacterial cell and the cell surface hydrophobicity moreover the thermodynamic analyses stated that edna brought about affirmative acid base interaction accountable for bacterial aggregation and adhesion to surface in conjunction with biofilm formation das et al 2011 extracellular lipids with surface active properties have substantiated to safeguard bacteria from strong surface tension of adjacent water in the surface environment thus accelerating the bacterial growth on solid surfaces flemming and wingender 2010 3 phase separated pretreatments of sludge and its disintegration mechanism as aforestated phase separated pretreatment incorporates deaggregation of eps matrix as it hinders the accessibility of intracellular organic matter for the consequent pretreatment thereby augmenting the biosolids disintegration rate variant phase separated pretreatment signifies diverse disintegration mechanism employed to liquefy the particulate organics existent in biosolids and provokes biogas generation and highlighted in table 1 most commonly thermal and free nitrous acids fna method of eps extraction is followed by many researcher wu et al 2018 wang et al 2017 antonelli et al 2011 have reported that the thermal eps extraction enhance the sludge hydrolysis release eps and reduced sludge viscosity which improves the biosolids dewatering and digestibility zhang et al 2015c have documented that the fna method of eps extraction is renewable and low cost chemical which also accelerates the biosolids biodegradability it also stimulate the production of volatile fatty acid from ad of biosolids fig 2 illustrates the mechanism of eps removal using different pretreatment methods while fig 3 depicts the mechanism of various pretreatment methods which are discussed comprehensively in the forthcoming sections 3 1 chemical induced biological pretreatments chemical induced biological pretreatment is carried out by usage of chemical such as acid alkalis or oxidants as deflocculating agent in advance to bacterial disintegration with the desideratum of amplifying the sludge solubilization rate and biogas volume kavitha et al 2015c the monovalent sodium and divalent cation particularly magnesium and calcium are coupled with eps matrix are detached by ion exchange thereby mitigating the floc strength and stimulates floc disruption kavitha et al 2015a found out an optimal dosage of 0 03 g g ss of nacl liberated the intracellular components into liquid medium and effectuated maximum sludge liquefaction rate of 23 when succeeded by bacterial disaggregation likewise ph plays a vital role in bacterial growth and inclusion of chemical escalates sludge ionic strength no significant impact on ph was seen on usage of cacl2 as deflocculating agent because the bacteria adopted for pretreatment maintained an optimum ph of 6 5 throughout the study kavitha et al 2015d conversely sodium dodecyl sulfate sds ameliorates sludge ph to alkaline condition and necessitates adjusting ph to optimal conditions for attaining efficient liquefaction rate in the sub sequential bacterial pretreatment this was found to be in congruent with ushani et al 2018 where sodium thiosulphate sts when employed as a deflocculating agent aided with protease secreting bacterial pretreatment affirmed a greater scod release 22 and lofty methane production also chemical deflocculation strengthened the sludge enzymatic activity and functions as enzyme effectors in sludge particle bringing about higher disintegration rate it has been proclaimed that deflocculating agents used namely citric acid mgcl2 sds and mgso4at low dosage acted as enzyme activator whilst at higher dosage they enacted to be enzyme inhibitor thereby contributing to increased solubilization rate gayathri et al 2015 kavitha et al 2016c 2015c 2014b ushani et al 2017 3 2 physiochemical induced biological pretreatments physical pretreatment method such as thermal and microwave which when combined with chemical disintegration deflocculates the eps thereby increasing the surface area requisite for the succeeding biological pretreatment thus they lead to an enhancement in the sludge solubilization rate biological disintegration garners low energy for pretreatment analogous to other pretreatment methods physical mechanical for cell lysis and can be carried out using commercially available enzymes biosurfactant and antibiotics due to their pricey nature cultured bacterial strains are put to use which attests to be cost effective studies have revealed that thermo chemical pre treatment at temperatures nearly lower than 80 c accrued an efficacious sludge solubilization kavitha et al 2014a 2015b low temperature thermo chemical lttc treatment was adopted by kavitha et al 2017b for eps disaggregation tailed by bacterial pretreatment it was proclaimed that lttc pretreatment had a significant impact on eps fractionation which induced solubilization of the lb eps and tb eps into liquid medium at a minimal thermo chemical energy of 0 06 kj l antibiotic secreting bacteria asb was exploited for cell lysis as it rifts apart the peptidoglycan layer and proteins confined in the sludge cell membrane and liberates the accessible intercellular components into the liquid phase withal floc deaggregation by lttc plummet the ph value from 8 to 6 8 fomenting a favorable condition for cell lysis by asb and attained an effectual sludge disintegration rate 3 3 solar photo catalysis induced biological pretreatment in the midst of advanced oxidation processes aop s available solar photo catalysis process chiefly adopted for waste water treatment is lately used in sludge pretreatment studies banu et al 2008 liu et al 2014 the catalyst employed can be used under suspension or immobilized during pretreatment process solar photo catalysis is mediated with bacterial disintegration to enhance the biodegradability of sludge biomass and proves to be an economical one tio2 used as photo catalyst for eps disruption admitted into the sludge clings onto the eps surface and gets agitated and forms hydroxyl ions due to solar radiation liu et al 2013 on the grounds of the above photo catalytic reaction eps deflocculation at tio2 dosage of 0 03 g g ss discharges the intracellular components with negligible cell lysis up to 15 min irradiation time into the aqueous phase elevating liquefaction level of the succeeding biological pretreatment sharmila et al 2015 moreover the impact of sludge enzymatic activity by solar photo catalysis interceded by tio2was imperative as the enzymes entrapped within the sludge biosolids curtails the amplitude of sludge disintegration oxidization of the detached sludge flocs into co2elevates the discharge rate of enmeshed enzymes until 15min of irradiation time furthermore a fall in enzyme level was seen beyond the optimal time in view of mineralization of liberated enzymes by the oxidative radical liu et al 2013 sharmila et al 2015 moreover phase separation by tio2 induced biosurfactant secreting bacterial pretreatment attained a liquefaction rate of 22 9 a similar solubilization rate was accomplished when a thin filmed tio2 layer was employed prior to bacterial pretreatment sharmila et al 2017 3 4 chemical induced mechanical pretreatments considering the extensive amount of energy dissipated by mechanical pretreatments namely ultrasonication and disperser parity between energy and sludge disintegration efficiency demands a suitable pretreatment in the form of phase separation chemicals like acid alkali surfactants and oxidation reagents applied to pretreatment attacks the eps cell wall releasing the soluble organic matter and hydrolytic enzymes confined in sludge matrix thereby magnifying the sludge solubilization rate of the consecutive pretreatment cell lysis brought out by mechanical pretreatment such as sonication and disperser enforces cavitational forces which propagates hydrodynamic shear forces to solubilize the particulate organic matter the particles thus liberated during eps deaggregation causes an increase in the sludge disintegration and methane production rate a synergistic effect was observed when chemo mediated ultrasonication pretreatment was employed to attain an accelerated sludge solubilization rate at an optimal specific energy input sei of 171 9 kj kg ts gayathri et al 2015 here cation binding agent like citric acid disrupts the eps which bridges the divalent cations ca2 and mg2 liberating the intracellular components into the liquid medium hence the subsequent sonication pretreatment elevates the accessibility of bacterial cell for sludge biodegradation due to hydro mechanical shear forces generated by ultrasonic irradiation at an optimal sonic pretreatment time of 1 min contrarily eps solubilization induced a slump in ph value due to acid synthesis during chemo mediated sonic pretreatment which contradicted kavitha et al 2015d diversely sds used for floc disruption ebbs the surface tension of the sludge medium which is counteracted by the tantamount of cavitational forces emanated by disperser pretreatment this further intensifies the sludge liquefaction rate 26 and biomethanation at an energy input of 5013 kj kg ts devi et al 2014 3 5 mechanical induced biological pretreatment mechanical pretreatment namely disperser and ultrasonication occurs under various mechanical action such as shear stress turbulence thrust and cavitational forces the said mechanical actions were held responsible for breaking down the large sized particulate matter into soluble matter thus enhancing the surface area of contact for the sub sequential biological pretreatment eps existent on surface of sludge biosolids are disaggregated using disperser prior to bacterial pretreatment operates on stator rotor principle owing to the expeditious force and infinitesimal space amidst rotor and stator cavitational forces are developed which segregates the soluble eps from sludge biomass and transfers it into the liquid medium banu et al 2018a moreover mechanical pretreatment decreases the sludge ph value as the disassociated liquefying organics undergo hydrolysis or evolution of acidic compounds kavitha et al 2017b withal no such occurrences were detected during the study as the pretreatment was carried out at moderate conditions at a low sei of 9 5 kj kg ts the ph value declined from 6 8 to 6 45 and was found favorable for the succeeding bacterial pretreatment in addition the enzymatic action of the inoculated bacteria causes a fissure in the cell wall releasing the soluble organics into the liquid phase and achieved a higher biomass lysate liquefaction rate of 22 4 3 6 chemical induced physical pretreatments elimination of the eps present in the peripheral layer of sludge biomass liberated the intracellular organics and enzymes into the liquid medium which brings about a protraction in surface area for the consequential physical pretreatment eps deaggregation further admits direct infiltration of microwaves into the sludge cells which shorten the treatment time this led to proliferation in the potency of microwave liquefaction rate amidst the available chemical methods cation binding agents testifies to be effective for eps disassociation as it ousts out the coalesced divalent cations which scales down the energy expenditure when subjected to the posterior physical pretreatment zeolite a chelating agent utilized by banu et al 2019 ensued maximal eps disassociation of 93 at 0 04 g g ss dosage by virtue of its water adsorbing capacity this evoked congenital heat severing the sludge cell walls thereby releasing the intracellular components which ameliorates the sludge biodegradability rate thus zeolite mediated microwave pretreatment ze mwp negotiated a maximum cod solubilization rate of 42 8 at a sei of 16 200 kj kg ts resulting in an upsurge in biomethanation production value in an equivalent study by eswari et al 2017 lower dosage of oxidant like h2o2 1 0 g g ss was sufficient for oh radical engenderment which was found efficacious for eps deaggregation of sludge flocs under acidic ph conditions facilitating methanogenesis additionally it curbs the energy expenditure during the ensuing microwave pretreatment mp furthermore a larger solubilization rate 46 6 was obtained in h2o2 mediated microwave pretreatment at a lower sei of 10 810 kj kg ts akin to the combined pretreatment by eswari et al 2016 where sei of 18 600 kj kg ts was requisite for attaining maximal liquefaction 3 7 mechanical induced physical pretreatments as stated earlier ejection of eps residing on the surface of sludge biosolids heightens the diffusion efficiency of microwaves physical pretreatment endorsing high cell biomass lysate rate thus eps removal curtails the energy disbursed for enhancing the sludge disintegration and methane potential rate disaggregation of eps by mechanical methods like sonication applies acoustic cavitational phenomenon emanating hydroxyl radicals which infiltrates the cell wall emancipating the soluble intracellular molecules into the liquid phase prior to microwave pretreatment kavitha et al 2018 tyagi et al 2014 cell disintegration by microwave pretreatment is interceded by the thermal effect generated by the microwaves permeates the sludge cell wall this rifts apart the hydrogen bond and as a consequence contributes to a rise in the sludge liquefaction rate likewise sei plays an integral role in physical mechanical pretreatment which has an aftereffect on the sludge solubilization rate a study by kavitha et al 2018 revealed that ultrasonic mediated microwave pretreatment ummp accomplished a higher sludge liquefaction rate 33 2 at a lower sei of 16 700 kj kg ts with enhanced biomethanation level 3 8 mechanical induced chemical pretreatments as known earlier phase separation pretreatment embodies eps disaggregation pursued by cell biomass lysate for achieving a competent sludge disintegration of sludge biomass eps prevalent on the peripheral of sludge flocs amasses bound epss in the form of lb epss and tb epss as a double layered structure this bound eps curbs the diffusion of intracellular hydrolytic enzymes for the consequent pretreatment contracting the performance of sludge solubilization and biomethanation potency cho et al 2012 mechanical pretreatment such as sonication disperser are used to disrupt the eps stratum which improves the solubility rate of particulate organics into the aqueous phase ozonation another mode of chemical pretreatment degenerates into hydroxyl radical and infiltrates through the biosolids sheath revealing the liquefiable organics susceptible for sludge biodegradation cesaro and belgiorno 2013 this method is generally used with mechanical pretreatment to curtail the energy demand a study by kannah et al 2017a explored the impact of disperser mediated ozone pretreatment dop for phase separation disperser pretreatment operates on the principle of rotor stator effect which induces tenacious shear stress and thrust on the sludge biosolids furthermore this effectuates dissolution of soluble eps at a lower rpm 3000rpm with 30s treatment time into the supernatant phase with trivial biomass lysate further eps stratification was also assayed at the optimal rpm which divulged that maximal emulsifiable bound eps occurred at 30s dispersion pretreatment time this when superseded by ozonation pretreatment brought about proficient biomass disintegration at lower ozone dosage of 0 014 go3 g ss akin to the aforestated study packyam et al 2015 employed ultrasonication supervened by ozonation pretreatment was found to be cogent for phase separation with reduced sei 76 4 log1 88 kj kg ts also the above phase separation pretreatment process cuts down the ozone dosage which improved the sludge biodegradability rate and biomethane potential 3 9 advanced oxidation process aop induced mechanical pretreatments aop namely fenton process leverages short reaction time as to other processes such as ultraviolet and solar photo catalysis method addition of fenton reagent to sludge biomass brings forth a vicious cyclic reaction amid fe2 and h2o2which actuated chemical oxidation stimulating hydroxyl radicals plus the eps present in sludge surface gets severed facilitating the liquefiable organics into liquid medium kavitha et al 2016e besides lower dosage of fenton reagent was found to be propitious as higher quantity accumulates ferrous ion concentration in biosolids kavitha et al 2016a affirmed in their study that 0 2 g g ss fe2 with 0 8 g g ss of h2o2 of fenton reagent successfully deflocculated eps with treatment time of 5min further when pursued by ultrasonication for effective cell lysis pretreatment dissevers the cell membrane of biosolids as a result of the hydro mechanical shear forces brought about by bubble implosion and attained a high sludge liquefaction rate of 34 4 bettering the performance of methane generation 4 effect of phase separated pretreatment on sludge characteristics and its evaluation as aforesaid in the previous section phase separated pretreatment encompasses deflocculation and cell lysis stage and its effects on a range of parameters are summated in the subsequent section and also tabulated in table 2 4 1 cod liquefaction scod release was used as indicant parameter to gauge the sludge solubilization rate relatively by numerous researchers hence it was used to assess the sludge disintegration efficiency in phase separated pretreatment studies in chemo mediated bacterial pretreatment scod rate was found to elevate 21 4 up to a treatment time of 42h owing to the riddance of eps by mgcl2 this instigates the enzymes secreting bacteria to discharge the intracellular compounds entrapped in the cell wall as to the flocculated one 10 5 kavitha et al 2015c the scod rate ceased aftermath of 42h in flocculated and deflocculated sludge to 2 9 and 4 3 as the inoculated bacterial strain exploits the soluble organic matter released also lower ozone dosage 0 014 go3 g ss was utilized to procure high scod rate 32 8 during cell disintegration in disperser induced ozone pretreatment this tested out to be beneficial compared to ozone pretreatment 0 042 go3 g ss carried out solely kannah et al 2017a this was further attributed to the disintegration of larger size sludge particles which enlarge the surface area and offers easier admittance for ozone to strike tian et al 2015 a prominent decline in scod level was seen when the dosage exceeds the above limit in view of ozone oxidation plus specific energy input plays a vital role in energy intensive treatment process such as microwave and thermal in a comparable study sludge deflocculation effectuated by sodium tri polyphosphate stpp prior to microwave pretreatment emanated a surge in cod solubilization rate 28 when subjected to diverse microwave irradiation ebenezer et al 2015a besides maximum cod liquefaction rate was noted at a minimal sei of 14 000 kj kg which proved quite profitable when compared to mw pretreatment done single handedly where higher specific energy were used to attain the corresponding cod liquefaction rate ariunbaatar et al 2014 at sei farther to 45 000 kj kg ts a decline in scod value was espied owing to the sectional vaporization of sludge organics further studies by kavitha et al 2016a confirmed that sole ultrasonication pretreatment 18936 9 kj kg ts requisites specific energy input sei about 29 times more than that required by fenton mediated ultrasonication pretreatment process 641 kj kg ts to acquire 30 cod solubilization rate as a result of the total energy being depleted on cell lysis fenton mediation sonic pretreatment displayed a rise in scod level whereas in sole ultrasonic pretreatment certain amount of se was dissipated towards eps detachment causing a decline in scod these findings discernibly illustrate a significant distinction between deflocculated and flocculated sludge in terms of cod liquefaction rate 4 2 solids reduction solids reduction is often correlated with cod liquefaction to be used as another fundamental index to measure the efficiency of sludge disintegration solids reduction is requisite in a liquefaction process as it deduces the sludge disintegration of non biodegradable organic matter into liquefiable organic matter tian et al 2015 solids reduction was found maximal 17 14 in sludge deflocculated by cacl2 prior to bacterial pretreatment up to treatment time of 42h than sole bacterially pretreated sludge 13 57 kavitha et al 2015d the results were the consequence of the combinative effect of floc disintegration and biosurfactant activity of inoculated bacterial strain beyond 42h solids reduction was found to be equable as the cultural action of inoculated strain obtained saturation stage likewise a collateral study by kavitha et al 2015a detected an enhancement in solids reduction 26 at the end of 42h when deflocculated by nacl prior to bacterial pretreatment from the above research outcome it can be inferred that solids reduction during bacterial pretreatment ensue a dual phase progression viz phase 1 rapid disintegration stage 0 to 42 h and phase 2 passivedisintegration stage 48 to 84 h furthermore sei plays a prominent role which proliferate the efficiency of phase separated pretreatment banu et al 2018a rate of solids reduction percentage was examined in both sonicated sd and fenton induced sonicated sludge fsd with gradual rise in sei at both phases kavitha et al 2016a a paramount solids reduction was seen in fsd 25 as to sd 16 at sei of about 641 kj kg ts as anticipated in phase 1 eps disaggregation by fenton in sludge biomass acts as a precursor to ultrasonic pretreatment and heightened the potency of solids reduction additionally to accomplish the aforesaid maximum solids reduction sd sludge requisites sei that surpasses optimum sei value also phase 2 delineates a stable solids reduction percentage as diminutive quantity of solids remnant existed in the sludge biomass correspondingly sludge deflocculated by disperser prior to mw pretreatment 17 33 draws out a higher solids liquefaction rate in phase 1 the liquefaction rate obtained when correlated with lone mw pretreatment was 9 3 up to sei of 18 000 kj kg ts while phase 2 observed only a slender rise in solids reduction level in spite of higher sei it was then disclosed that tremendous increase in mw sei had only a trivial impact on solids liquefaction rate kavitha et al 2016b conjointly the solids reduction rate attained in phase separated pretreatment were found superior to than that obtained by tian et al 2015 in the course of sole sonication 38 3 solids reduction and ultrasonic combined ozone post treatment 42 1 solids reduction 4 3 biopolymers liquefaction proficiency of sludge solubilization efficiency is also valuated based on intracellular biopolymer liquefaction rate such as protein and carbohydrate encapsulated within the cell wall which significantly contributes towards biomethane enhancement akin to the cod liquefaction and solids reduction trend biopolymer liquefaction also pursues a comparable profile which is condensed to rapid solubilization and passive degradation phase during bacterial disintegration a study by kavitha et al 2015d compared the soluble protein and carbohydrate release rate amidst sludge deflocculated by cacl2 preceding to bacterial pretreatment lone bacterially pretreated sludge and control though there was a gradual increment in both protein and carbohydrate concentration up to a disintegration time of 42h there was a drastic fall in the release rate beyond it as foreseen in the above liquefaction parameters deflocculated sludge exhibited maximum biopolymer release in comparison with flocculated sludge because of floc disruption by cacl2 while the successive bacterial pretreatment leads to escalation of the biopolymer release level thereby boosting the cell lysis rate the results of the biopolymer concentration obtained were persistent with the findings by ushani et al 2017 attained during bacterial disintegration the decline in biopolymer concentration after 42h was the result of disaggregation of the soluble protein and carbohydrate into peptides amino acids and simple sugars yang et al 2010 in an analogous phase separated study disperser induced ozone pretreatment dop demonstrated exemplary protein 1896 8 mg l and carbohydrate release 675 2 mg l at minimal ozone dosage of 0 014 go3 g ss as to the ozone pretreatment op where maximal protein 1251 2 mg l and carbohydrate 386 8 mg l level was obtained only at a higher dosage level of 0 042 go3 g ss kannah et al 2017a this was accredited to the fact that eps deflocculation by disperser engendered the ozone to permeate into sludge biomass unleashing the intracellular biopolymer component into the aqueous medium in conjunction with the above findings it can be seen that protein release rate surpasses the release level of carbohydrate this was conformed to the fact that readily soluble carbohydrates were liberated along with proteins as glycol proteins through sludge solubilization kavitha et al 2020a in addition to this li et al 2013 have reported that the concentration of biopolymer obtained by phase separated pretreatment protein 4 4 mg l and polysaccharides 136 mg l is relatively higher than the individual pretreatment protein 2 2 mg l and polysaccharides 72 mg l of sludge the increasing profile of biopolymer exposes the noteworthy of phase separated pretreatment 4 4 sludge enzyme activity hydrolytic enzymes such as protease and amylase that are entrapped in sludge flocs play a pivotal role in hydrolyzing the complex macromolecules existent in sludge biosolids lin and li 2018 thus it is imperative to emancipate these intracellular enzymes into the aqueous medium through eps deaggregation brought about by phase separated pretreatment this in turn intensifies the sludge disintegration rate customarily protease is liable for rupturing the peptide bonds of protein whereas amylase is held accountable for the dissolution of polysaccharides like carbohydrates kavitha et al 2013 an amplified protease and amylase activity 0 17 u ml and 0 14 u ml was detected in a disperser mediated bacterially pretreated sludge up to 42 h this was due to the compiled activity of eps expulsion which unleashes the hydrolytic enzymes enmeshed in sludge flocs and the enzymes secreted by the inoculated bacteria banu et al 2018a this was further affirmed in a analogous study by kavitha et al 2015c where eps disruption by mgcl2 followed by bacterial pretreatment observed a rise in the protease and amylase activity in short eps disaggregation stimulated by phase separated pretreatment has a significant impact on the exoneration of intracellular enzymes present on sludge cell walls and thereby proves to be beneficial for sludge disintegration xiao et al 2017 have documented that the microbes exploited during extracellular electron transfer eet results in biomass productivity and communication exchange with peripheral environments or with different cells each and every microbial cell is enclosed and adheres together by transparent adhesion fluid which is referred as eps liang et al 2021 have studied the effect of electron transfer and interaction between extracellular electron transfer and enzyme activity eet is directed by groups of electron transfer microbes in which humic substances is considered as an electron acceptor to oxidize biodegradable organic fraction it also utilized for the microbial growth energy generation and supports development of new humic substances the concentration of humus substances is the most important factor that governs the electron exchange capacity and biosolids enzyme activity currently the study on electron transfer of humic substance is a remarkable field of research the humus is the considered as an electron acceptor and redox mediator during digestion processes it also accelerates the activity of enzyme involved in the redox reaction particularly the hydrolytic bacteria which promotes the digestibility of organic biosolids and simultaneously degradation of recalcitrant compounds occurs it was documented that the addition of additives and pretreatment to the biosolids energetically enhances the hydrolysis and increase the accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfa concentration during ad 4 5 evaluation of phase separated pretreatments 4 5 1 biochemical methane potential assay bmp assay the vitality of employing phase separated pretreatment to uplift the anaerobic biodegradability of sludge biosolids was accomplished by conducting biochemical methane potential assay bmp generally bmp is delineated as the maximal methane volume generated per g of vs substrate symbolizing the biodegradability potency of sludge the outcome of bmp assays relies upon diverse parameters namely temperature pressure inoculum to substrate ratio isr substrate preferred stirring and composition of flush gas wang 2016 a diploid curve is pursued for methane generation which is found pertinent with the bacterial growth curve and assorted as lag phase exponential phase and flattening phase kavitha et al 2015d the methane yield of sludge biosolids can be indirectly gauged by the cod liquefaction rate jingura and kamusoko 2017 the initial biomethane yield was found to be low at the time of acclimatization in the sludge an augment rise in methane yield was evident at the exponential stage whilst disaggregated sludge ultrasonically mediated microwave pretreated sludge proffered a heightened methane production rate of 0 2 l g cod as to aggregated one microwave pretreated sludge which showed 0 078 l g cod this was attributed to the surge in the solubilization rate of particulate organic matter into the liquid medium and resorted to as substrate by the methanogens thereby boosting its biomethanation value furthermore methane volume increased during the treatment and was characterized in terms of cod thus 0 8114g of cod extracted in deagglomerated pretreated sludge was approximal to the methane transmuted all along the pretreatment process kavitha et al 2018 concurrently the liquefied cod retrieved in the course of anaerobic digestion pares down the acidogenesis which in turn curtails the methanogenesis in conjunction with the preceding statement extrication of eps unveils the biopolymers existent in the sludge biomass to the acidogenic biomass which eventually hydrolyzes the solubilized intracellular organic matter ousted into the aqueous phase this generates a substantial amount of vfa thus accelerating the rate of biomethanation kavitha et al 2015c this result was congruent to the one obtained by kavitha et al 2016b while using disperser mediated microwave pretreatment likewise a harsh pretreatment condition renders indocile compounds to hinder the permutation of soluble organic matter into methane kim et al 2013 this was affirmed by eswari et al 2017 where the biomethanation value of h2o2 mediated microwave pretreatment elevated up to 85 6 whilst microwave pretreatment showed up 76 under optimal treatment conditions conclusively a surpassing biomethanation yield was noteworthy in phase separated pretreatment when correlated with microwave disintegration coupled with h2o2 acidic sludge pretreatment eswari et al 2016 4 5 2 assessment of hydrolysis and acidogenesis acidification also known as fermentation is a transitional process which transpires during anaerobic fermentation and metamorphoses the hydrolyzed organics into amassment of vfa the engendered acidified products namely short chain fatty acids like acetic acid propionic acid etc co2 h2 are made available to the anaerobic methanogens present in the sludge biomass which subsequently enhances the methane yield moreover the end product of vfa which originates by hydrolysis and acidogenesis during acidogenic fermentation brings out minuscule quantity of vfa sludge pretreatment therefore quickens the hydrolysis rate and decreases the macromolecules existent in the sludge matrix to micro molecules concomitantly by the extracellular hydrolytic enzyme of acidogens eps overlying sludge biosolids matrix embeds the intracellular organic matter available to the microbes for cell disintegration along these lines kavitha et al 2015c interpreted that eps which holds up the biopolymer components are detached from the sludge cell wall by the aid of mgcl2 and ejects them into the liquid medium this resulted in vfa accretion which when employed in succession with bacterial pretreatment as a result of eps deflocculation the concentration of vfa was found to be higher in chemo mediated bacterially pretreated sludge 640 mg l when compared to bacterially pretreated 345 mg l and control 55 mg l similarly another researcher devi et al 2014 have reported after 72 h of anaerobic fermentation a highest vfa yield of 700 mg l 350 mg l and 60 mg l was obtained from deaggregated sludge followed by disperser pretreatment disperser pretreatment alone and control respectively 4 6 economics and scale up of phase separated pretreatments despite the demand to aggrandize the proficiency of biomethanation through phase separated pretreatment by an array of lab scale approaches a techno economic valuation is indispensable for extensive usage of the technology economic analysis thus aids as the guidance to comprehend the factual reasons and the source of cost in an energy process moreover the energy outcome proliferated as methane and heat have got to be superior to the input energy requisite in a phase separated pretreatment which upholds the expediency and viability of the proffered method 4 6 1 energy balances the applicability and like lines of a sludge pretreatment process to be implemented at pilot scale level generally complies with the heightened volume of biogas yield and solids reduction along these lines a thorough energy analysis on the energy expended and procured during the liquefaction process is imperative to decipher a befitting phase separated pretreatment pretreatment methods such as sonication dispersion high pulse electric field ozonation microwave etc employs electricity as a synergist to effectuate the sludge liquefaction process broadly sludge pumping mechanical stirring exploited for deaggregation pretreatment and anaerobic digestion are laid out as energy expended howbeit biomethane produced are intended as energy procured in the course of phase separated pretreatment the energy spent is calculated as per the work of kavitha et al 2020b and kannah et al 2021 and the equation given is below 1 es p t v ts where es is the energy spent kwh kg p is the power consumed kw t is the pretreatment time h v is the volume of substrate sample m3 and ts is the total solid concentration of sample kg m3 moreover cod liquefaction rate was used as the criterion for deducing the energetic and economic feasibility of a sludge disintegration process in a study by kannah et al 2017a dop requisites lessened amount of energy 247 35 kwh ton to retrieve 20 cod solubilization rate as to the op 412 42 kwh ton this insinuated the fact that a substantial quantity of energy was resorted to eps disaggregation together with an equivalent amount of energy procured as biomethane correspondingly the energy procured as methane 616 kwh to attain 30 biomass lysis was proclaimed to be equitable in the course of microwave mw and zeolite mediated microwave ze mw pretreatment study whilst mw pretreatment demanded a twofold energy expenditure to obtain the aforesaid lysis level banu et al 2019 in addition to the above energy ratio beyond 1 and an affirmatory net energy production is vital for bringing forth an energy efficient phase separated pretreatment the energy ratio is the ratio of total output energy energy gain during ad in the form of biogas to total input energy energy spent to produce biogas which includes deflocculation pretreatment pumping and ad energy the equation of energy ratio is given in fig 4 kavitha et al 2019 accomplished a positive net energy and energy ratio 20 5 kwh ton and 1 04 during fragmented anaerobic granules bacterial pretreatment fag bp as to the bacterial pretreatment 307 2 kwh ton and 0 4 nevertheless a section of energy was famished at the time of eps deaggregation and it could be counterpoised by the volume of methane procured thereby depicting the energetic competency of fag bp these results were found consistent by kavitha et al 2018 where ummp divulged the energy ratio to be 1 08 and accomplished an affirmative net energy contrarily a negative net energy was accomplished when eps was disaggregated by sodium citrate and preceded by immobilized tio2 thin film pretreatment process while it resulted in a 85 net energy savings than the flocculated one sharmila et al 2019 plus the desideratum of energy by thermal pretreatments takes into account the temperature endorsed all along the pretreatment and the energy expended is calculated as per the work of kannah et al 2019 and the equation is given below 2 te m sh tfi tin where te is the thermal energy of biomass kj sh is the specific heat of biomass for example sludge 4 2 kj kg c m is the mass of biomass kg tin is the initial temperature of biomass c and tfiis the final temperature of biomass c a detailed energy analysis of disperser deflocculation and ultrasonic pretreatment of biosolids elucidated in this section is further depicted in fig 4 furthermore the heat recovered by cooling down the pretreated sludge at the same time is calculated as per the work of banu et al 2018d and the equation is given below 3 hr m sh tp tin m sh tp td where hr is the heat energy recovered from biomass kj sh is the specific heat of biomass 4 2 kj kg c m is the mass of biomass kg tp is the pretreatment temperature c td is the digestion temperature c and ɸ is the efficiency of heat exchanger an energetic probe on lttc phase separated pretreatment revealed a positive net energy profit of 48 26kwh ton owing to the eps disruption at an optimal temperature of 60 c additionally mass balancing was carried out to gauge the sludge reduction potential of the preferential phase separated pretreatment at pilot scale level banu et al 2020 attained a 47 8 of solids reduction in the course of anaerobic digestion of tio2embedded chitosan thin film tctf mediated bacterially pretreated sludge while the net solids disposal amounted to about 693 75kg ton which was superior to the flocculated sludge as a consequence eps fractionation cuts down the quantity of sludge to be cast off thereby narrowing down the landfill disposal cost also the energy analysis of different phase separated pretreatment methods is tabulated in table 3 the energy analysis is carried out based on experimental conditions of banu et al 2018a and kavitha et al 2020a for disperser deflocculation and ultrasonic pretreatment the flow rate of pretreated biosolids to anaerobic digestion is fixed as 100 m3 d 4 2 m3 h the energy required per day for deflocculation ultrasonic pretreatment solids pumping and energy demand in ad is calculated as 96 5952 2 15 and 175 kwh d respectively therefore the total input energy tie is calculated to be 6225 15 kwh d and the total output energy toe is calculated as 767 85 kwh d then the net energy is obtained as 5457 30 kwh ve indicates energy loss however the toe is less than tie in this case phase separated pretreatment for direct ultrasonic pretreatment to achieve 25 cod solubilization it demands high input energy when compared with previous case kavitha et al 2016a 4 6 2 cost evaluation along with the energy and mass balance investigation a comprehensive study on cost benefits of the contemplated phase separated pretreatment is crucial before enforcing it at a pilot scale level discrete costs like sludge biosolids disposal cost operational cost inclusive of chemical and energy cost and the disposal cost of sludge biosolids reduced after treatment were probed to assess the practicability of the adopted pretreatment method in view of this energy cost biomethane and cost of biosolids abatement were envisaged as profitable cost gain whereas chemical cost and leftover biosolids cost after treatment were conceded to be nonprofit loss in accordance with a study by kavitha et al 2015c the energy cost for one kwh was recorded to be 0 23 and sludge biosolids disposal cost was noted to be 0 28 kg solids banu et al 2019 found that the net profit cost of zeolite microwave pretreated ze mwp sludge 26 ton of ss surpassed the microwave mw pretreated sludge 27 ton of ss and proved to be beneficial equivalently a profitable net cost of 107 74 was taped in a tctf induced bacterially pretreated sludge with an energy ratio of 1 04 banu et al 2020 which outperformed the net profit cost 2 6 ton of sludge incurred by an analogous phase separated bp study ushani et al 2018 and also the net profit 83 39 ton of sludge obtained through combinative pretreatment of alkaline and microwave by chi et al 2011 4 7 future perspectives the current encyclopedic review gives an overall insight about how deflocculation of eps influences the pretreatment efficiency thereby augmenting the biomethanation production and sludge disintegration rate nonetheless a plausible experimental study should be carried out to figure out the presence of objectionable compounds during a pretreatment process recently many researchers have focused their research in discovering a cost effective solution to reduce the heavy metal contamination associated with wastewater treatment and biosolids management gupta and diwan 2017 have reviewed about the possibility and technique associated with heavy metal ions for eps disruption typically there are several expensive techniques followed widely for eps disruption and heavy metal removal such as ultrasonication filtration nano ultra electrodialysis chemical coagulation precipitation and ion exchange even though these techniques are effective they cause certain adverse effect on environment by generating toxic and harmful by product inorder to safeguard the environment from these adverse effects an interesting biological approach was studied by cui et al 2020 in their study the authors have checked the possibility of biosorption mechanism of metal ions on eps disruption as a result highest adsorption efficiency of 95 94 and 78 were achieved for lead cadmium and nickel eps disruption respectively another researcher hu et al 2021 have documented that the simultaneous heavy metal removal and eps disruption enhances the sludge dewatering capacity they studied the effect of fe ii coupled with electro oxidation technology to achieve excellent dewatering performance and higher sludge stability in addition to this the authors have stated that an increase in the heavy metal removal percentage indicates the stability of the dewatered sludge and its effectiveness in eps disruption and fragmentation of sludge floc additionally a valuable quantification strategy should be figured out while adopting a method calibrating its adverse facets likewise was engaged for phase separated pretreatments is subjective to digestion in batch scale process thereupon effect of phase separated sludge pretreatment on semi continuous continuous digesters should be thoroughly probed and if possible in a pilot scale level in the near future 5 conclusion in a nutshell this review explores the role of eps in curbing the hydrolysis rate necessitating its removal for subsequent pretreatment in a protracted manner also it catalogues the disintegration mechanism of discrete phase separated pretreatment technology employed and its impact on sludge characteristics plus the assessment of the technique through bmp assays was fermentation and techno economic analysis affirmed that eps deflocculation prior to the subsequent pretreatment elevated the sludge disintegration efficiency and biomethane production rate however an appropriate explanation is vital to waive out the aforesaid challenges for full scale implementation of a specific phase separated pretreatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this review article acknowledgements this work was supported by the department of biotechnology india

17016,extracellular polymeric substances eps existent in anaerobic sludge proves to be a barrier for sludge liquefaction and biomass lysis efficiency hence eps deaggregation heightens the surface area for the subsequent pretreatment thereby uplifting the sludge disintegration and biomethanation rate this review documents the role of eps and its components which inhibits sludge hydrolysis and also the various phase separated pretreatment methods available with its disintegration mechanism to enhance the biomass lysis and methane production rate it also illustrates the effects of phase separated pretreatment on the sludge disintegration rate which embodies two phases floc disruption and cell lysis accompanied by their computation through biomethane potential assay and fermentation analysis comprehensively additionally energy balance study and cost analysis requisite for successful implementation of a proposed phase separated pretreatment on a pilot scale level and their challenges are also reviewed overall this paper documents the potency of phase separated pretreatment for full scale approach keywords extracellular polymeric substances biomass lysis biomethane production energy balance cost analysis 1 introduction enormous amount of waste activated sludge was emanating from wastewater treatment plant wwtps are stabilized extensively through aerobic and anaerobic digestion ad here ad is weighed down as a dynamic method considering its green energy recovery in the form of biogas in a profitable manner however hydrolytic and acidogenic phases plays a transitional role in the bioconversion of was to biogas wherein hydrolysis is premeditated as a hindering aspect in ad this warrants an admissible sludge pretreatment method prior to ad which stimulates the sludge disintegration rate kavitha et al 2016a in recent times numerous pretreatment methods have been recorded by legion of researchers such as physical thermal and microwave ebenezer et al 2015a kavitha et al 2018 2016b yan et al 2013 mechanical ultrasonication and disperser banu et al 2018a gayathri et al 2015 kavitha et al 2016c 2016d 2014a chemical acid alkali and ozone banu et al 2012 kannah et al 2017a kavitha et al 2015a advanced oxidation process aop sharmila et al 2017 biological enzyme and microbes kavitha et al 2017b yang et al 2010 kannah et al 2020 and combinative disintegrations banu et al 2018b kannah et al 2017b kavitha et al 2015b 2017a have been employed to augment sludge biodegradation these methods cause a fissure in cell walls of sludge biomass which emancipates the strongly bound organic materials from the cell in house into the aqueous phase soluble extracellular polymeric substance eps existent in sludge matrix plays a vital role in curbing the accessibility of substrates for sludge disintegration whereas release of eps actuates the surface area exposure for the microbial cell disintegration process in a prominent manner merrylin et al 2014 eps are highly composed of extracellular biopolymers such as protein carbohydrates lipid humic and nucleic acids the concentration of biopolymer may vary with respect to certain environmental factors during formation of biosolids eps it act as a protective layer of the intracellular compounds present in the biosolids it forms a complex net structure with plenty of water that reduces biosolids dewatering capacity eps which binds over the surface of biosolids limits the hydrolysis which directly affects the anaerobic biodegradability therefore removal of eps from biosolids prior to ad will be more effective in enhancing the anaerobic biodegradability and biogas yield the anaerobic biodegradability assay is found to be an advantageous method for critical evaluation of biogas production among diverse substrates which gets amplified by an assortment of pretreatment methods available lately packyam et al 2015 on the other hand the eps removal from biosolids significantly reduces pretreatment input energy and accelerates the biosolids liquefaction which indirectly supports the profitable output yield besides the energy demand of a process should be at least counterbalanced by the volume of methane produced which in turn necessitates an energy balance and economic assessment to ascertain the practicability of implementing the pretreatment process in a massive scale therefore extraction of eps prior to sludge pretreatment is found to be imperative in heightening the process efficiency the speed and extent of liquefaction curtailment of cost and also contracts the time consumed during the process kavitha et al 2020a accordingly the two step disintegration phase separation process which consists of floc disintegration fd and cell lysis cl phase conceptualized by tiehm et al 2001 and show et al 2007 was utilized to study the solubilization rate the disruption of floc matrix solubilizes the intercellular organic components and is utilized as substrates by microbes present in sludge biomass and strengthens the sludge pretreatment process the passive hydrolysis of particulate organics in ad caps the disintegration rate of biosolids which necessitates pretreatment process prior to ad an integral function of pretreatment is to agitate the eps matrix thereby ousting the available intercellular components into the aqueous phase thus quickening the organic solids conversion rate and increase the methane productivity volume so far very limited literatures are available reporting phase separated sludge pretreatment process and this review gives an encyclopedic insight of the process this review mainly focus on understanding the mechanism of eps formation and the biopolymer that cause hindrance towards biosolids hydrolysis considering the above facts the review concerning the role of eps in sludge matrix importance of eps removal different techniques employed for eps disruption techno economic aspect of eps removal prior to pretreatment of biosolids were discussed comprehensively 2 extracellular polymeric substances eps in sludge biomass 2 1 role of eps in sludge matrix eps which is a fundamental component in biofilms contributes to about 50 to 80 w w of total biofilms weight which is ascertained through various electron microscopy techniques meng et al 2016 at present a proportionate amount of reviews is available demonstrating the constructive and adverse aspects of eps in sludge biomass which influence the performance of biological wastewater treatment systems salama et al 2016 sheng et al 2010 eps have a paramount impact on the physicochemical properties of sludge biomass such as structure surface charge flocculation settling properties stability adhesion dewatering properties hydrophobicity hydrophilicity and adsorption ability presence of multivalent cations in eps plays an immense role on sludge biomass structure thereby influencing their flocculation rate li et al 2012 eps are amphoteric to certain extent as it embodies profuse amount of charged functional groups and non polar groups e g aromatics aliphatic in proteins and hydrophobic region in polysaccharides besides the hydrophobic regions in eps yields to organic pollutants adsorption as an augmented hydrophobicity in general brings about better flocculation shi et al 2017 the dewatering potentiality of activated sludge was found to improve with an upsurge in eps content owing to its lower shear sensitivity and reduced degree of dispersion on the contrary a magnified eps level was not favorable for substrate mass transfer by virtue of the decrease in permeability of anaerobic sludge granules sheng et al 2010 plus eps are scrutinized as an imperative intermediary in the adhesion of bacteria to the sludge surface in the course of biofilm formation upholding the structural integrity of biofilms and consequently leads to the overall stability of biofilm withal several studies have reported that sludge settling bioflocculation and dewatering properties offers a huge correlation with eps components and its spatial distribution additionally dna and protein contents in eps have an affirmatory relationship with sludge volume index svi in comparison to polysaccharides peng et al 2014 zhang et al 2015a according to spatial distribution eps can be classified depending on the extraction methods as soluble eps and bound eps soluble eps comprises of soluble macromolecules colloids and slimes that can voluntarily move amidst the surrounding liquor and sludge flocs while bound eps comprising capsule polymers gelatin coacervates loose polymers and attached organic compounds firmly adheres to cells and form a discrete cover layer yu etal 2009 the various constituents of soluble and bound eps instigated variation in the metal biosorption activity and organic pollutant binding capacity furthermore bound epss are subdivided into loosely bound epss lb epss and tightly bound epss tb epss which forms a dynamic double layer structure yu et al 2008 tsai et al 2008 found that large molecules mw 20000da in tb eps were protein like substances of high aromaticity which amounted to 22 of the total dissolved organic carbon doc as to lb eps likewise yu et al 2009 reported that the tb eps extracted from sludge displayed huge amount of macromolecules content 330 1200 kda and trivalent cation in comparison to other fractions which delivers larger flocculating rate to kaolin suspensions thus variant eps components demonstrate a specific role which chiefly serves as an influential function of eps and microbial aggregates in a study by zhao et al 2015 lb eps had an outstanding effect on sludge flocculation sludge settling and dewaterability characteristic as to the tb eps and thus improving potentiality of cell cell interactions conjointly nutritional parameters such as c n ratio serve as an influential parameter in the activated sludge systems and have a significant impact on the nature and eps matter present in sludge biomass ye et al 2011 along these lines eps plays a crucial role in sludge granulation and couples cells through ion bridging interaction hydrophobic interaction and polymer entanglement which intensifies the formation of sludge granules sheng et al 2010 concisely eps has a definitive influence on sludge properties and are profoundly interconnected which creates a great impact on the performance of activated sludge systems 2 2 components of extracellular polymers and its hindrance towards hydrolysis sludge biomass is built up of diverse microbes that are susceptible to environmental conditions like temperature organic load etc there by altering the physical chemical and biological properties of activated sludge as for this reason the flocculation mechanisms of as are considered to be complex as to colloidal particles the intermolecular interaction theories such as polymer bridging derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory hydrophobic interactions multivalent bridging theory and steric interactions elucidates the binding of sludge biomass elaborately li and yu 2014 whilst the classical dlvo theory and extended dlvo theory which is based on colloid and surface chemistry illustrates the cell to cell interactions and bio flocculation process it suggests energy assessment owing to the overlying of electric double layers generally repulsion and the vander waals energy typically attraction in terms of inter particle distance additionally lewis acid base interactions were taken into consideration in extended dlvo theory according to this theory sludge cells support one another as they advance closer and cause a decline in the double layer thickness furthermore the repulsion between particles also contracts and thus concedes short range attractive forces to bolster sludge aggregation liu et al 2010 2008 the aforesaid dlvo theory and multivalent bridging theory are strongly associated to cations since multivalent cations can bridge eps and thereby reduces the effect of negative charges on the as surface wilén et al 2008 usually divalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 play a crucial role in bioflocculation process and keeps the cations adhesive to eps in a three dimensional matrix other significant inter particle forces consist of hydrogen bonds thermodynamic forces covalent bonds etc the extended dlvo theory could quantify the non bioparticles still it has a definite application in bioaggregates particularly when eps expulsion influences the cell surface characteristics moreover gelation divalent cation bridging and lectin binding have been extensively probed relative to the mechanism of cell aggregation which are physico chemical interactions involving the production and function of eps ding et al 2015 likewise the hydrophobicity of the cell surface was partially due to the hydrophobic portion of eps macromolecules besides the above mentioned theories accentuate the significance of eps since they stockpile on the cell surface initially and gets engaged in sludge flocs interactions and subsequently used to analyze the physical and chemical characteristics of as typically production of eps by microorganisms seems to occur by diverse mechanisms which is inclusive of secretion degradation cell death and adsorption of environmental substances in wastewater treatment systems sun et al 2016 eps are thus construed as high molecular weight polymers generated by microorganisms that are placed either on microbial cell surfaces or in the enclosing environment the properties of eps components extracted had preeminent impact on certain functions of sludge biomass they have been proclaimed as heterogeneous structure characterized by distinct aspects such as extraction and characterization methods utilized sludge type process parameter culture and growth conditions basuvaraj et al 2015 and fig 1 illustrates the structure and formation of sludge flocs a few researchers have documented that the effect of substrate greatly influences the biosynthesis and composition of eps existent in the surface of biosolids the two major substrates such as carbon source in terms of cod concentration and nitrogen plays an essential role in biosynthesis of eps nouha et al 2018 eps typically consist of proteins polysaccharides humic like substances uronic acids nucleic acids and lipids geyik et al 2016 have reported the difference in concentration of protein and carbohydrates which influences eps hydrophobicity and is correlated with the substrate provided to the microbial communities the greatest part of eps comprises of carbohydrates exo polysaccharides which are chiefly linear or branched long molecules embodies either homo polysaccharides or hetero polysaccharides howbeit most exo polysaccharides found in eps are hetero polysaccharides like glucose mannose and n acetylgalactosamine pertaining to amalgamation of neutral and charged sugar residues further organic or inorganic matter existence alters the physical and biological properties of eps flemming and wingender 2010 distinctively polysaccharide owing to the accretion of few functional groups such as carboxyl ecoo plays a major role in cell aggregation which gets enhanced due to the multivalent ions present in them yin et al 2015 pan et al 2010 have reported that the eps and protein plays a different functional role during formation of biosolids and extraction of eps the eps fills the gap between the biosolids to form stable floc or aggregates the eps matrixes act as a multiuse functional part of microbial communities which includes binding agents protective layer which indicates stability of biosolids and its physiology next to polysaccharides another important extracellular polymers such as protein plays a vital role in the formation of biosolids eps yin et al 2015 according to zhang et al 2015b the concentration of protein in waste activated sludge and anaerobic granular sludge depends on hydrophobic interactions and elevated the aggregation of microbial activity in biosolids the proteins originated from internal and external surface of biosolids has different molecular functions based on their catalytic activity and binding activity the protein found in the outer surface of the biosolids tends to increase the floc binding capacity apart from the authentic form of polysaccharides and proteins those molecules existent in hybrid form in the course of covalent bonds and their configuration and structure have proven to have disseminated effects on the formation and stability of microbial aggregates bourven et al 2015 extracellular dna edna serve as a decisive factor to establish the three dimensional structure of biofilms thereby providing structural integrity to the eps matrix also it clouted the zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter of bacterial cell and the cell surface hydrophobicity moreover the thermodynamic analyses stated that edna brought about affirmative acid base interaction accountable for bacterial aggregation and adhesion to surface in conjunction with biofilm formation das et al 2011 extracellular lipids with surface active properties have substantiated to safeguard bacteria from strong surface tension of adjacent water in the surface environment thus accelerating the bacterial growth on solid surfaces flemming and wingender 2010 3 phase separated pretreatments of sludge and its disintegration mechanism as aforestated phase separated pretreatment incorporates deaggregation of eps matrix as it hinders the accessibility of intracellular organic matter for the consequent pretreatment thereby augmenting the biosolids disintegration rate variant phase separated pretreatment signifies diverse disintegration mechanism employed to liquefy the particulate organics existent in biosolids and provokes biogas generation and highlighted in table 1 most commonly thermal and free nitrous acids fna method of eps extraction is followed by many researcher wu et al 2018 wang et al 2017 antonelli et al 2011 have reported that the thermal eps extraction enhance the sludge hydrolysis release eps and reduced sludge viscosity which improves the biosolids dewatering and digestibility zhang et al 2015c have documented that the fna method of eps extraction is renewable and low cost chemical which also accelerates the biosolids biodegradability it also stimulate the production of volatile fatty acid from ad of biosolids fig 2 illustrates the mechanism of eps removal using different pretreatment methods while fig 3 depicts the mechanism of various pretreatment methods which are discussed comprehensively in the forthcoming sections 3 1 chemical induced biological pretreatments chemical induced biological pretreatment is carried out by usage of chemical such as acid alkalis or oxidants as deflocculating agent in advance to bacterial disintegration with the desideratum of amplifying the sludge solubilization rate and biogas volume kavitha et al 2015c the monovalent sodium and divalent cation particularly magnesium and calcium are coupled with eps matrix are detached by ion exchange thereby mitigating the floc strength and stimulates floc disruption kavitha et al 2015a found out an optimal dosage of 0 03 g g ss of nacl liberated the intracellular components into liquid medium and effectuated maximum sludge liquefaction rate of 23 when succeeded by bacterial disaggregation likewise ph plays a vital role in bacterial growth and inclusion of chemical escalates sludge ionic strength no significant impact on ph was seen on usage of cacl2 as deflocculating agent because the bacteria adopted for pretreatment maintained an optimum ph of 6 5 throughout the study kavitha et al 2015d conversely sodium dodecyl sulfate sds ameliorates sludge ph to alkaline condition and necessitates adjusting ph to optimal conditions for attaining efficient liquefaction rate in the sub sequential bacterial pretreatment this was found to be in congruent with ushani et al 2018 where sodium thiosulphate sts when employed as a deflocculating agent aided with protease secreting bacterial pretreatment affirmed a greater scod release 22 and lofty methane production also chemical deflocculation strengthened the sludge enzymatic activity and functions as enzyme effectors in sludge particle bringing about higher disintegration rate it has been proclaimed that deflocculating agents used namely citric acid mgcl2 sds and mgso4at low dosage acted as enzyme activator whilst at higher dosage they enacted to be enzyme inhibitor thereby contributing to increased solubilization rate gayathri et al 2015 kavitha et al 2016c 2015c 2014b ushani et al 2017 3 2 physiochemical induced biological pretreatments physical pretreatment method such as thermal and microwave which when combined with chemical disintegration deflocculates the eps thereby increasing the surface area requisite for the succeeding biological pretreatment thus they lead to an enhancement in the sludge solubilization rate biological disintegration garners low energy for pretreatment analogous to other pretreatment methods physical mechanical for cell lysis and can be carried out using commercially available enzymes biosurfactant and antibiotics due to their pricey nature cultured bacterial strains are put to use which attests to be cost effective studies have revealed that thermo chemical pre treatment at temperatures nearly lower than 80 c accrued an efficacious sludge solubilization kavitha et al 2014a 2015b low temperature thermo chemical lttc treatment was adopted by kavitha et al 2017b for eps disaggregation tailed by bacterial pretreatment it was proclaimed that lttc pretreatment had a significant impact on eps fractionation which induced solubilization of the lb eps and tb eps into liquid medium at a minimal thermo chemical energy of 0 06 kj l antibiotic secreting bacteria asb was exploited for cell lysis as it rifts apart the peptidoglycan layer and proteins confined in the sludge cell membrane and liberates the accessible intercellular components into the liquid phase withal floc deaggregation by lttc plummet the ph value from 8 to 6 8 fomenting a favorable condition for cell lysis by asb and attained an effectual sludge disintegration rate 3 3 solar photo catalysis induced biological pretreatment in the midst of advanced oxidation processes aop s available solar photo catalysis process chiefly adopted for waste water treatment is lately used in sludge pretreatment studies banu et al 2008 liu et al 2014 the catalyst employed can be used under suspension or immobilized during pretreatment process solar photo catalysis is mediated with bacterial disintegration to enhance the biodegradability of sludge biomass and proves to be an economical one tio2 used as photo catalyst for eps disruption admitted into the sludge clings onto the eps surface and gets agitated and forms hydroxyl ions due to solar radiation liu et al 2013 on the grounds of the above photo catalytic reaction eps deflocculation at tio2 dosage of 0 03 g g ss discharges the intracellular components with negligible cell lysis up to 15 min irradiation time into the aqueous phase elevating liquefaction level of the succeeding biological pretreatment sharmila et al 2015 moreover the impact of sludge enzymatic activity by solar photo catalysis interceded by tio2was imperative as the enzymes entrapped within the sludge biosolids curtails the amplitude of sludge disintegration oxidization of the detached sludge flocs into co2elevates the discharge rate of enmeshed enzymes until 15min of irradiation time furthermore a fall in enzyme level was seen beyond the optimal time in view of mineralization of liberated enzymes by the oxidative radical liu et al 2013 sharmila et al 2015 moreover phase separation by tio2 induced biosurfactant secreting bacterial pretreatment attained a liquefaction rate of 22 9 a similar solubilization rate was accomplished when a thin filmed tio2 layer was employed prior to bacterial pretreatment sharmila et al 2017 3 4 chemical induced mechanical pretreatments considering the extensive amount of energy dissipated by mechanical pretreatments namely ultrasonication and disperser parity between energy and sludge disintegration efficiency demands a suitable pretreatment in the form of phase separation chemicals like acid alkali surfactants and oxidation reagents applied to pretreatment attacks the eps cell wall releasing the soluble organic matter and hydrolytic enzymes confined in sludge matrix thereby magnifying the sludge solubilization rate of the consecutive pretreatment cell lysis brought out by mechanical pretreatment such as sonication and disperser enforces cavitational forces which propagates hydrodynamic shear forces to solubilize the particulate organic matter the particles thus liberated during eps deaggregation causes an increase in the sludge disintegration and methane production rate a synergistic effect was observed when chemo mediated ultrasonication pretreatment was employed to attain an accelerated sludge solubilization rate at an optimal specific energy input sei of 171 9 kj kg ts gayathri et al 2015 here cation binding agent like citric acid disrupts the eps which bridges the divalent cations ca2 and mg2 liberating the intracellular components into the liquid medium hence the subsequent sonication pretreatment elevates the accessibility of bacterial cell for sludge biodegradation due to hydro mechanical shear forces generated by ultrasonic irradiation at an optimal sonic pretreatment time of 1 min contrarily eps solubilization induced a slump in ph value due to acid synthesis during chemo mediated sonic pretreatment which contradicted kavitha et al 2015d diversely sds used for floc disruption ebbs the surface tension of the sludge medium which is counteracted by the tantamount of cavitational forces emanated by disperser pretreatment this further intensifies the sludge liquefaction rate 26 and biomethanation at an energy input of 5013 kj kg ts devi et al 2014 3 5 mechanical induced biological pretreatment mechanical pretreatment namely disperser and ultrasonication occurs under various mechanical action such as shear stress turbulence thrust and cavitational forces the said mechanical actions were held responsible for breaking down the large sized particulate matter into soluble matter thus enhancing the surface area of contact for the sub sequential biological pretreatment eps existent on surface of sludge biosolids are disaggregated using disperser prior to bacterial pretreatment operates on stator rotor principle owing to the expeditious force and infinitesimal space amidst rotor and stator cavitational forces are developed which segregates the soluble eps from sludge biomass and transfers it into the liquid medium banu et al 2018a moreover mechanical pretreatment decreases the sludge ph value as the disassociated liquefying organics undergo hydrolysis or evolution of acidic compounds kavitha et al 2017b withal no such occurrences were detected during the study as the pretreatment was carried out at moderate conditions at a low sei of 9 5 kj kg ts the ph value declined from 6 8 to 6 45 and was found favorable for the succeeding bacterial pretreatment in addition the enzymatic action of the inoculated bacteria causes a fissure in the cell wall releasing the soluble organics into the liquid phase and achieved a higher biomass lysate liquefaction rate of 22 4 3 6 chemical induced physical pretreatments elimination of the eps present in the peripheral layer of sludge biomass liberated the intracellular organics and enzymes into the liquid medium which brings about a protraction in surface area for the consequential physical pretreatment eps deaggregation further admits direct infiltration of microwaves into the sludge cells which shorten the treatment time this led to proliferation in the potency of microwave liquefaction rate amidst the available chemical methods cation binding agents testifies to be effective for eps disassociation as it ousts out the coalesced divalent cations which scales down the energy expenditure when subjected to the posterior physical pretreatment zeolite a chelating agent utilized by banu et al 2019 ensued maximal eps disassociation of 93 at 0 04 g g ss dosage by virtue of its water adsorbing capacity this evoked congenital heat severing the sludge cell walls thereby releasing the intracellular components which ameliorates the sludge biodegradability rate thus zeolite mediated microwave pretreatment ze mwp negotiated a maximum cod solubilization rate of 42 8 at a sei of 16 200 kj kg ts resulting in an upsurge in biomethanation production value in an equivalent study by eswari et al 2017 lower dosage of oxidant like h2o2 1 0 g g ss was sufficient for oh radical engenderment which was found efficacious for eps deaggregation of sludge flocs under acidic ph conditions facilitating methanogenesis additionally it curbs the energy expenditure during the ensuing microwave pretreatment mp furthermore a larger solubilization rate 46 6 was obtained in h2o2 mediated microwave pretreatment at a lower sei of 10 810 kj kg ts akin to the combined pretreatment by eswari et al 2016 where sei of 18 600 kj kg ts was requisite for attaining maximal liquefaction 3 7 mechanical induced physical pretreatments as stated earlier ejection of eps residing on the surface of sludge biosolids heightens the diffusion efficiency of microwaves physical pretreatment endorsing high cell biomass lysate rate thus eps removal curtails the energy disbursed for enhancing the sludge disintegration and methane potential rate disaggregation of eps by mechanical methods like sonication applies acoustic cavitational phenomenon emanating hydroxyl radicals which infiltrates the cell wall emancipating the soluble intracellular molecules into the liquid phase prior to microwave pretreatment kavitha et al 2018 tyagi et al 2014 cell disintegration by microwave pretreatment is interceded by the thermal effect generated by the microwaves permeates the sludge cell wall this rifts apart the hydrogen bond and as a consequence contributes to a rise in the sludge liquefaction rate likewise sei plays an integral role in physical mechanical pretreatment which has an aftereffect on the sludge solubilization rate a study by kavitha et al 2018 revealed that ultrasonic mediated microwave pretreatment ummp accomplished a higher sludge liquefaction rate 33 2 at a lower sei of 16 700 kj kg ts with enhanced biomethanation level 3 8 mechanical induced chemical pretreatments as known earlier phase separation pretreatment embodies eps disaggregation pursued by cell biomass lysate for achieving a competent sludge disintegration of sludge biomass eps prevalent on the peripheral of sludge flocs amasses bound epss in the form of lb epss and tb epss as a double layered structure this bound eps curbs the diffusion of intracellular hydrolytic enzymes for the consequent pretreatment contracting the performance of sludge solubilization and biomethanation potency cho et al 2012 mechanical pretreatment such as sonication disperser are used to disrupt the eps stratum which improves the solubility rate of particulate organics into the aqueous phase ozonation another mode of chemical pretreatment degenerates into hydroxyl radical and infiltrates through the biosolids sheath revealing the liquefiable organics susceptible for sludge biodegradation cesaro and belgiorno 2013 this method is generally used with mechanical pretreatment to curtail the energy demand a study by kannah et al 2017a explored the impact of disperser mediated ozone pretreatment dop for phase separation disperser pretreatment operates on the principle of rotor stator effect which induces tenacious shear stress and thrust on the sludge biosolids furthermore this effectuates dissolution of soluble eps at a lower rpm 3000rpm with 30s treatment time into the supernatant phase with trivial biomass lysate further eps stratification was also assayed at the optimal rpm which divulged that maximal emulsifiable bound eps occurred at 30s dispersion pretreatment time this when superseded by ozonation pretreatment brought about proficient biomass disintegration at lower ozone dosage of 0 014 go3 g ss akin to the aforestated study packyam et al 2015 employed ultrasonication supervened by ozonation pretreatment was found to be cogent for phase separation with reduced sei 76 4 log1 88 kj kg ts also the above phase separation pretreatment process cuts down the ozone dosage which improved the sludge biodegradability rate and biomethane potential 3 9 advanced oxidation process aop induced mechanical pretreatments aop namely fenton process leverages short reaction time as to other processes such as ultraviolet and solar photo catalysis method addition of fenton reagent to sludge biomass brings forth a vicious cyclic reaction amid fe2 and h2o2which actuated chemical oxidation stimulating hydroxyl radicals plus the eps present in sludge surface gets severed facilitating the liquefiable organics into liquid medium kavitha et al 2016e besides lower dosage of fenton reagent was found to be propitious as higher quantity accumulates ferrous ion concentration in biosolids kavitha et al 2016a affirmed in their study that 0 2 g g ss fe2 with 0 8 g g ss of h2o2 of fenton reagent successfully deflocculated eps with treatment time of 5min further when pursued by ultrasonication for effective cell lysis pretreatment dissevers the cell membrane of biosolids as a result of the hydro mechanical shear forces brought about by bubble implosion and attained a high sludge liquefaction rate of 34 4 bettering the performance of methane generation 4 effect of phase separated pretreatment on sludge characteristics and its evaluation as aforesaid in the previous section phase separated pretreatment encompasses deflocculation and cell lysis stage and its effects on a range of parameters are summated in the subsequent section and also tabulated in table 2 4 1 cod liquefaction scod release was used as indicant parameter to gauge the sludge solubilization rate relatively by numerous researchers hence it was used to assess the sludge disintegration efficiency in phase separated pretreatment studies in chemo mediated bacterial pretreatment scod rate was found to elevate 21 4 up to a treatment time of 42h owing to the riddance of eps by mgcl2 this instigates the enzymes secreting bacteria to discharge the intracellular compounds entrapped in the cell wall as to the flocculated one 10 5 kavitha et al 2015c the scod rate ceased aftermath of 42h in flocculated and deflocculated sludge to 2 9 and 4 3 as the inoculated bacterial strain exploits the soluble organic matter released also lower ozone dosage 0 014 go3 g ss was utilized to procure high scod rate 32 8 during cell disintegration in disperser induced ozone pretreatment this tested out to be beneficial compared to ozone pretreatment 0 042 go3 g ss carried out solely kannah et al 2017a this was further attributed to the disintegration of larger size sludge particles which enlarge the surface area and offers easier admittance for ozone to strike tian et al 2015 a prominent decline in scod level was seen when the dosage exceeds the above limit in view of ozone oxidation plus specific energy input plays a vital role in energy intensive treatment process such as microwave and thermal in a comparable study sludge deflocculation effectuated by sodium tri polyphosphate stpp prior to microwave pretreatment emanated a surge in cod solubilization rate 28 when subjected to diverse microwave irradiation ebenezer et al 2015a besides maximum cod liquefaction rate was noted at a minimal sei of 14 000 kj kg which proved quite profitable when compared to mw pretreatment done single handedly where higher specific energy were used to attain the corresponding cod liquefaction rate ariunbaatar et al 2014 at sei farther to 45 000 kj kg ts a decline in scod value was espied owing to the sectional vaporization of sludge organics further studies by kavitha et al 2016a confirmed that sole ultrasonication pretreatment 18936 9 kj kg ts requisites specific energy input sei about 29 times more than that required by fenton mediated ultrasonication pretreatment process 641 kj kg ts to acquire 30 cod solubilization rate as a result of the total energy being depleted on cell lysis fenton mediation sonic pretreatment displayed a rise in scod level whereas in sole ultrasonic pretreatment certain amount of se was dissipated towards eps detachment causing a decline in scod these findings discernibly illustrate a significant distinction between deflocculated and flocculated sludge in terms of cod liquefaction rate 4 2 solids reduction solids reduction is often correlated with cod liquefaction to be used as another fundamental index to measure the efficiency of sludge disintegration solids reduction is requisite in a liquefaction process as it deduces the sludge disintegration of non biodegradable organic matter into liquefiable organic matter tian et al 2015 solids reduction was found maximal 17 14 in sludge deflocculated by cacl2 prior to bacterial pretreatment up to treatment time of 42h than sole bacterially pretreated sludge 13 57 kavitha et al 2015d the results were the consequence of the combinative effect of floc disintegration and biosurfactant activity of inoculated bacterial strain beyond 42h solids reduction was found to be equable as the cultural action of inoculated strain obtained saturation stage likewise a collateral study by kavitha et al 2015a detected an enhancement in solids reduction 26 at the end of 42h when deflocculated by nacl prior to bacterial pretreatment from the above research outcome it can be inferred that solids reduction during bacterial pretreatment ensue a dual phase progression viz phase 1 rapid disintegration stage 0 to 42 h and phase 2 passivedisintegration stage 48 to 84 h furthermore sei plays a prominent role which proliferate the efficiency of phase separated pretreatment banu et al 2018a rate of solids reduction percentage was examined in both sonicated sd and fenton induced sonicated sludge fsd with gradual rise in sei at both phases kavitha et al 2016a a paramount solids reduction was seen in fsd 25 as to sd 16 at sei of about 641 kj kg ts as anticipated in phase 1 eps disaggregation by fenton in sludge biomass acts as a precursor to ultrasonic pretreatment and heightened the potency of solids reduction additionally to accomplish the aforesaid maximum solids reduction sd sludge requisites sei that surpasses optimum sei value also phase 2 delineates a stable solids reduction percentage as diminutive quantity of solids remnant existed in the sludge biomass correspondingly sludge deflocculated by disperser prior to mw pretreatment 17 33 draws out a higher solids liquefaction rate in phase 1 the liquefaction rate obtained when correlated with lone mw pretreatment was 9 3 up to sei of 18 000 kj kg ts while phase 2 observed only a slender rise in solids reduction level in spite of higher sei it was then disclosed that tremendous increase in mw sei had only a trivial impact on solids liquefaction rate kavitha et al 2016b conjointly the solids reduction rate attained in phase separated pretreatment were found superior to than that obtained by tian et al 2015 in the course of sole sonication 38 3 solids reduction and ultrasonic combined ozone post treatment 42 1 solids reduction 4 3 biopolymers liquefaction proficiency of sludge solubilization efficiency is also valuated based on intracellular biopolymer liquefaction rate such as protein and carbohydrate encapsulated within the cell wall which significantly contributes towards biomethane enhancement akin to the cod liquefaction and solids reduction trend biopolymer liquefaction also pursues a comparable profile which is condensed to rapid solubilization and passive degradation phase during bacterial disintegration a study by kavitha et al 2015d compared the soluble protein and carbohydrate release rate amidst sludge deflocculated by cacl2 preceding to bacterial pretreatment lone bacterially pretreated sludge and control though there was a gradual increment in both protein and carbohydrate concentration up to a disintegration time of 42h there was a drastic fall in the release rate beyond it as foreseen in the above liquefaction parameters deflocculated sludge exhibited maximum biopolymer release in comparison with flocculated sludge because of floc disruption by cacl2 while the successive bacterial pretreatment leads to escalation of the biopolymer release level thereby boosting the cell lysis rate the results of the biopolymer concentration obtained were persistent with the findings by ushani et al 2017 attained during bacterial disintegration the decline in biopolymer concentration after 42h was the result of disaggregation of the soluble protein and carbohydrate into peptides amino acids and simple sugars yang et al 2010 in an analogous phase separated study disperser induced ozone pretreatment dop demonstrated exemplary protein 1896 8 mg l and carbohydrate release 675 2 mg l at minimal ozone dosage of 0 014 go3 g ss as to the ozone pretreatment op where maximal protein 1251 2 mg l and carbohydrate 386 8 mg l level was obtained only at a higher dosage level of 0 042 go3 g ss kannah et al 2017a this was accredited to the fact that eps deflocculation by disperser engendered the ozone to permeate into sludge biomass unleashing the intracellular biopolymer component into the aqueous medium in conjunction with the above findings it can be seen that protein release rate surpasses the release level of carbohydrate this was conformed to the fact that readily soluble carbohydrates were liberated along with proteins as glycol proteins through sludge solubilization kavitha et al 2020a in addition to this li et al 2013 have reported that the concentration of biopolymer obtained by phase separated pretreatment protein 4 4 mg l and polysaccharides 136 mg l is relatively higher than the individual pretreatment protein 2 2 mg l and polysaccharides 72 mg l of sludge the increasing profile of biopolymer exposes the noteworthy of phase separated pretreatment 4 4 sludge enzyme activity hydrolytic enzymes such as protease and amylase that are entrapped in sludge flocs play a pivotal role in hydrolyzing the complex macromolecules existent in sludge biosolids lin and li 2018 thus it is imperative to emancipate these intracellular enzymes into the aqueous medium through eps deaggregation brought about by phase separated pretreatment this in turn intensifies the sludge disintegration rate customarily protease is liable for rupturing the peptide bonds of protein whereas amylase is held accountable for the dissolution of polysaccharides like carbohydrates kavitha et al 2013 an amplified protease and amylase activity 0 17 u ml and 0 14 u ml was detected in a disperser mediated bacterially pretreated sludge up to 42 h this was due to the compiled activity of eps expulsion which unleashes the hydrolytic enzymes enmeshed in sludge flocs and the enzymes secreted by the inoculated bacteria banu et al 2018a this was further affirmed in a analogous study by kavitha et al 2015c where eps disruption by mgcl2 followed by bacterial pretreatment observed a rise in the protease and amylase activity in short eps disaggregation stimulated by phase separated pretreatment has a significant impact on the exoneration of intracellular enzymes present on sludge cell walls and thereby proves to be beneficial for sludge disintegration xiao et al 2017 have documented that the microbes exploited during extracellular electron transfer eet results in biomass productivity and communication exchange with peripheral environments or with different cells each and every microbial cell is enclosed and adheres together by transparent adhesion fluid which is referred as eps liang et al 2021 have studied the effect of electron transfer and interaction between extracellular electron transfer and enzyme activity eet is directed by groups of electron transfer microbes in which humic substances is considered as an electron acceptor to oxidize biodegradable organic fraction it also utilized for the microbial growth energy generation and supports development of new humic substances the concentration of humus substances is the most important factor that governs the electron exchange capacity and biosolids enzyme activity currently the study on electron transfer of humic substance is a remarkable field of research the humus is the considered as an electron acceptor and redox mediator during digestion processes it also accelerates the activity of enzyme involved in the redox reaction particularly the hydrolytic bacteria which promotes the digestibility of organic biosolids and simultaneously degradation of recalcitrant compounds occurs it was documented that the addition of additives and pretreatment to the biosolids energetically enhances the hydrolysis and increase the accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfa concentration during ad 4 5 evaluation of phase separated pretreatments 4 5 1 biochemical methane potential assay bmp assay the vitality of employing phase separated pretreatment to uplift the anaerobic biodegradability of sludge biosolids was accomplished by conducting biochemical methane potential assay bmp generally bmp is delineated as the maximal methane volume generated per g of vs substrate symbolizing the biodegradability potency of sludge the outcome of bmp assays relies upon diverse parameters namely temperature pressure inoculum to substrate ratio isr substrate preferred stirring and composition of flush gas wang 2016 a diploid curve is pursued for methane generation which is found pertinent with the bacterial growth curve and assorted as lag phase exponential phase and flattening phase kavitha et al 2015d the methane yield of sludge biosolids can be indirectly gauged by the cod liquefaction rate jingura and kamusoko 2017 the initial biomethane yield was found to be low at the time of acclimatization in the sludge an augment rise in methane yield was evident at the exponential stage whilst disaggregated sludge ultrasonically mediated microwave pretreated sludge proffered a heightened methane production rate of 0 2 l g cod as to aggregated one microwave pretreated sludge which showed 0 078 l g cod this was attributed to the surge in the solubilization rate of particulate organic matter into the liquid medium and resorted to as substrate by the methanogens thereby boosting its biomethanation value furthermore methane volume increased during the treatment and was characterized in terms of cod thus 0 8114g of cod extracted in deagglomerated pretreated sludge was approximal to the methane transmuted all along the pretreatment process kavitha et al 2018 concurrently the liquefied cod retrieved in the course of anaerobic digestion pares down the acidogenesis which in turn curtails the methanogenesis in conjunction with the preceding statement extrication of eps unveils the biopolymers existent in the sludge biomass to the acidogenic biomass which eventually hydrolyzes the solubilized intracellular organic matter ousted into the aqueous phase this generates a substantial amount of vfa thus accelerating the rate of biomethanation kavitha et al 2015c this result was congruent to the one obtained by kavitha et al 2016b while using disperser mediated microwave pretreatment likewise a harsh pretreatment condition renders indocile compounds to hinder the permutation of soluble organic matter into methane kim et al 2013 this was affirmed by eswari et al 2017 where the biomethanation value of h2o2 mediated microwave pretreatment elevated up to 85 6 whilst microwave pretreatment showed up 76 under optimal treatment conditions conclusively a surpassing biomethanation yield was noteworthy in phase separated pretreatment when correlated with microwave disintegration coupled with h2o2 acidic sludge pretreatment eswari et al 2016 4 5 2 assessment of hydrolysis and acidogenesis acidification also known as fermentation is a transitional process which transpires during anaerobic fermentation and metamorphoses the hydrolyzed organics into amassment of vfa the engendered acidified products namely short chain fatty acids like acetic acid propionic acid etc co2 h2 are made available to the anaerobic methanogens present in the sludge biomass which subsequently enhances the methane yield moreover the end product of vfa which originates by hydrolysis and acidogenesis during acidogenic fermentation brings out minuscule quantity of vfa sludge pretreatment therefore quickens the hydrolysis rate and decreases the macromolecules existent in the sludge matrix to micro molecules concomitantly by the extracellular hydrolytic enzyme of acidogens eps overlying sludge biosolids matrix embeds the intracellular organic matter available to the microbes for cell disintegration along these lines kavitha et al 2015c interpreted that eps which holds up the biopolymer components are detached from the sludge cell wall by the aid of mgcl2 and ejects them into the liquid medium this resulted in vfa accretion which when employed in succession with bacterial pretreatment as a result of eps deflocculation the concentration of vfa was found to be higher in chemo mediated bacterially pretreated sludge 640 mg l when compared to bacterially pretreated 345 mg l and control 55 mg l similarly another researcher devi et al 2014 have reported after 72 h of anaerobic fermentation a highest vfa yield of 700 mg l 350 mg l and 60 mg l was obtained from deaggregated sludge followed by disperser pretreatment disperser pretreatment alone and control respectively 4 6 economics and scale up of phase separated pretreatments despite the demand to aggrandize the proficiency of biomethanation through phase separated pretreatment by an array of lab scale approaches a techno economic valuation is indispensable for extensive usage of the technology economic analysis thus aids as the guidance to comprehend the factual reasons and the source of cost in an energy process moreover the energy outcome proliferated as methane and heat have got to be superior to the input energy requisite in a phase separated pretreatment which upholds the expediency and viability of the proffered method 4 6 1 energy balances the applicability and like lines of a sludge pretreatment process to be implemented at pilot scale level generally complies with the heightened volume of biogas yield and solids reduction along these lines a thorough energy analysis on the energy expended and procured during the liquefaction process is imperative to decipher a befitting phase separated pretreatment pretreatment methods such as sonication dispersion high pulse electric field ozonation microwave etc employs electricity as a synergist to effectuate the sludge liquefaction process broadly sludge pumping mechanical stirring exploited for deaggregation pretreatment and anaerobic digestion are laid out as energy expended howbeit biomethane produced are intended as energy procured in the course of phase separated pretreatment the energy spent is calculated as per the work of kavitha et al 2020b and kannah et al 2021 and the equation given is below 1 es p t v ts where es is the energy spent kwh kg p is the power consumed kw t is the pretreatment time h v is the volume of substrate sample m3 and ts is the total solid concentration of sample kg m3 moreover cod liquefaction rate was used as the criterion for deducing the energetic and economic feasibility of a sludge disintegration process in a study by kannah et al 2017a dop requisites lessened amount of energy 247 35 kwh ton to retrieve 20 cod solubilization rate as to the op 412 42 kwh ton this insinuated the fact that a substantial quantity of energy was resorted to eps disaggregation together with an equivalent amount of energy procured as biomethane correspondingly the energy procured as methane 616 kwh to attain 30 biomass lysis was proclaimed to be equitable in the course of microwave mw and zeolite mediated microwave ze mw pretreatment study whilst mw pretreatment demanded a twofold energy expenditure to obtain the aforesaid lysis level banu et al 2019 in addition to the above energy ratio beyond 1 and an affirmatory net energy production is vital for bringing forth an energy efficient phase separated pretreatment the energy ratio is the ratio of total output energy energy gain during ad in the form of biogas to total input energy energy spent to produce biogas which includes deflocculation pretreatment pumping and ad energy the equation of energy ratio is given in fig 4 kavitha et al 2019 accomplished a positive net energy and energy ratio 20 5 kwh ton and 1 04 during fragmented anaerobic granules bacterial pretreatment fag bp as to the bacterial pretreatment 307 2 kwh ton and 0 4 nevertheless a section of energy was famished at the time of eps deaggregation and it could be counterpoised by the volume of methane procured thereby depicting the energetic competency of fag bp these results were found consistent by kavitha et al 2018 where ummp divulged the energy ratio to be 1 08 and accomplished an affirmative net energy contrarily a negative net energy was accomplished when eps was disaggregated by sodium citrate and preceded by immobilized tio2 thin film pretreatment process while it resulted in a 85 net energy savings than the flocculated one sharmila et al 2019 plus the desideratum of energy by thermal pretreatments takes into account the temperature endorsed all along the pretreatment and the energy expended is calculated as per the work of kannah et al 2019 and the equation is given below 2 te m sh tfi tin where te is the thermal energy of biomass kj sh is the specific heat of biomass for example sludge 4 2 kj kg c m is the mass of biomass kg tin is the initial temperature of biomass c and tfiis the final temperature of biomass c a detailed energy analysis of disperser deflocculation and ultrasonic pretreatment of biosolids elucidated in this section is further depicted in fig 4 furthermore the heat recovered by cooling down the pretreated sludge at the same time is calculated as per the work of banu et al 2018d and the equation is given below 3 hr m sh tp tin m sh tp td where hr is the heat energy recovered from biomass kj sh is the specific heat of biomass 4 2 kj kg c m is the mass of biomass kg tp is the pretreatment temperature c td is the digestion temperature c and ɸ is the efficiency of heat exchanger an energetic probe on lttc phase separated pretreatment revealed a positive net energy profit of 48 26kwh ton owing to the eps disruption at an optimal temperature of 60 c additionally mass balancing was carried out to gauge the sludge reduction potential of the preferential phase separated pretreatment at pilot scale level banu et al 2020 attained a 47 8 of solids reduction in the course of anaerobic digestion of tio2embedded chitosan thin film tctf mediated bacterially pretreated sludge while the net solids disposal amounted to about 693 75kg ton which was superior to the flocculated sludge as a consequence eps fractionation cuts down the quantity of sludge to be cast off thereby narrowing down the landfill disposal cost also the energy analysis of different phase separated pretreatment methods is tabulated in table 3 the energy analysis is carried out based on experimental conditions of banu et al 2018a and kavitha et al 2020a for disperser deflocculation and ultrasonic pretreatment the flow rate of pretreated biosolids to anaerobic digestion is fixed as 100 m3 d 4 2 m3 h the energy required per day for deflocculation ultrasonic pretreatment solids pumping and energy demand in ad is calculated as 96 5952 2 15 and 175 kwh d respectively therefore the total input energy tie is calculated to be 6225 15 kwh d and the total output energy toe is calculated as 767 85 kwh d then the net energy is obtained as 5457 30 kwh ve indicates energy loss however the toe is less than tie in this case phase separated pretreatment for direct ultrasonic pretreatment to achieve 25 cod solubilization it demands high input energy when compared with previous case kavitha et al 2016a 4 6 2 cost evaluation along with the energy and mass balance investigation a comprehensive study on cost benefits of the contemplated phase separated pretreatment is crucial before enforcing it at a pilot scale level discrete costs like sludge biosolids disposal cost operational cost inclusive of chemical and energy cost and the disposal cost of sludge biosolids reduced after treatment were probed to assess the practicability of the adopted pretreatment method in view of this energy cost biomethane and cost of biosolids abatement were envisaged as profitable cost gain whereas chemical cost and leftover biosolids cost after treatment were conceded to be nonprofit loss in accordance with a study by kavitha et al 2015c the energy cost for one kwh was recorded to be 0 23 and sludge biosolids disposal cost was noted to be 0 28 kg solids banu et al 2019 found that the net profit cost of zeolite microwave pretreated ze mwp sludge 26 ton of ss surpassed the microwave mw pretreated sludge 27 ton of ss and proved to be beneficial equivalently a profitable net cost of 107 74 was taped in a tctf induced bacterially pretreated sludge with an energy ratio of 1 04 banu et al 2020 which outperformed the net profit cost 2 6 ton of sludge incurred by an analogous phase separated bp study ushani et al 2018 and also the net profit 83 39 ton of sludge obtained through combinative pretreatment of alkaline and microwave by chi et al 2011 4 7 future perspectives the current encyclopedic review gives an overall insight about how deflocculation of eps influences the pretreatment efficiency thereby augmenting the biomethanation production and sludge disintegration rate nonetheless a plausible experimental study should be carried out to figure out the presence of objectionable compounds during a pretreatment process recently many researchers have focused their research in discovering a cost effective solution to reduce the heavy metal contamination associated with wastewater treatment and biosolids management gupta and diwan 2017 have reviewed about the possibility and technique associated with heavy metal ions for eps disruption typically there are several expensive techniques followed widely for eps disruption and heavy metal removal such as ultrasonication filtration nano ultra electrodialysis chemical coagulation precipitation and ion exchange even though these techniques are effective they cause certain adverse effect on environment by generating toxic and harmful by product inorder to safeguard the environment from these adverse effects an interesting biological approach was studied by cui et al 2020 in their study the authors have checked the possibility of biosorption mechanism of metal ions on eps disruption as a result highest adsorption efficiency of 95 94 and 78 were achieved for lead cadmium and nickel eps disruption respectively another researcher hu et al 2021 have documented that the simultaneous heavy metal removal and eps disruption enhances the sludge dewatering capacity they studied the effect of fe ii coupled with electro oxidation technology to achieve excellent dewatering performance and higher sludge stability in addition to this the authors have stated that an increase in the heavy metal removal percentage indicates the stability of the dewatered sludge and its effectiveness in eps disruption and fragmentation of sludge floc additionally a valuable quantification strategy should be figured out while adopting a method calibrating its adverse facets likewise was engaged for phase separated pretreatments is subjective to digestion in batch scale process thereupon effect of phase separated sludge pretreatment on semi continuous continuous digesters should be thoroughly probed and if possible in a pilot scale level in the near future 5 conclusion in a nutshell this review explores the role of eps in curbing the hydrolysis rate necessitating its removal for subsequent pretreatment in a protracted manner also it catalogues the disintegration mechanism of discrete phase separated pretreatment technology employed and its impact on sludge characteristics plus the assessment of the technique through bmp assays was fermentation and techno economic analysis affirmed that eps deflocculation prior to the subsequent pretreatment elevated the sludge disintegration efficiency and biomethane production rate however an appropriate explanation is vital to waive out the aforesaid challenges for full scale implementation of a specific phase separated pretreatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

1 poliovirus is 2 20 norovirus is 10 100 and echovirus type 12 is 3 3 102 pfu yezli and otter 2011 it has been estimated that 65 of the waterborne disease outbreaks associated with groundwater contamination are caused by enteric viruses benedict et al 2017 blackburn et al 2004 brunkard et al 2011 yates et al 1985 viruses are often introduced into the subsurface through sewage and wastewater effluents septic tanks and landfills yates et al 1985 and eventually reach groundwater sources fong et al 2007 gabrieli et al 2009 locas et al 2007 where they pose a potential threat to public health most human viruses have limited viability in the subsurface given residence times regnery et al 2017 sidhu and toze 2012 sidhu et al 2010 and aquifers are often used to polish drinking water through soil aquifer treatment elkayam et al 2018 fox 2020 hermes et al 2019 maliva 2020 morrison et al 2020 managed aquifer recharge mar is a cross cutting technology sprenger et al 2017 that can be used to

fields winter floodwater groundwater and reclaimed water ngwa 2014 nrc 2008 vadose zone recharge wells have been used successfully for many years in scottsdale az using treated recycled water city of scottsdale 2020 contamination of groundwater by stormwater drainage wells has been reported across the u s cadmus 1991 1996 1999 haney et al 1989 michael 1997 orr 1993 usepa 1997 wilde 1994 the microbial risks from mar techniques therefore need to be assessed to ensure adequate protection of groundwater quality and public health microbial risk assessment is an evaluation process to determine the likelihood of adverse human health effects following exposure to pathogenic microorganisms from various sources soller 2009 one of the commonly advocated methods for assessing microbial risks in recycled water systems is static quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra nrmmc ephc ahmc 2006 soller and eisenberg 2008 who 1993 static qmra focuses on estimating the probability of infection to an individual due to a single exposure event soller and eisenberg 2008 the qmra approach requires quantitative input data for pathogen occurrence in the source water and their removal through treatment barriers nrmmc ephc ahmc 2006 who 1993 appropriate quantification of input data and the selection of numerical values for each variable is critical for a successful risk assessment the parameters for qmra include the evaluation of pathogen source concentration an infectious dose of individual pathogen dose response assessment to estimate a risk of response infection illness or death human behavior water consumption pattern and the daily intake volume disease incidence of the local community as well as operational design and performance of the treatment barriers blokker et al 2014 qmrawiki 2014 when mar is used as a treatment barrier and recharge option for groundwater management the parameterization requires an understanding of pathogen transport and removal processes in the aquifer the residence time in an aquifer has been found to play a pivotal role in allowing biological and chemical processes to improve the water quality dillon et al 2003 toze et al 2010 the residence time for a drywell depends on the setback distance between the drywell and a drinking water well city of portland 2008 city of portland 2015 epa 1999 washington state department of ecology 2006 however current regulatory guidelines to protect groundwater quality require an additional separation distance between the bottom of the drywell and the local groundwater table of 1 5 to 13 m city of portland 2008 city of portland 2015 epa 1999 washington state department of ecology 2006 several field and laboratory scale experiments and numerical modeling approaches have been used to study virus removal and assess risk during mar anders and chrysikopoulos 2008 jin and flury 2002 powelson and gerba 1994 stevenson et al 2015 toze et al 2010 conducted an in situ decay study at a mar site and 1 log reduction for rotavirus was calculated as a function of residence time to be 34 days toze et al 2010 however the mar guideline evaluates the effectiveness of aquifer treatment expressed as log reductions to meet the human health based microbial target of 1 10 ⁶ dalys disability adjusted life years 6 log10 per person per year as a function of residence time nrmmc ephc ahmc 2006 page et al 2018 current guidelines for mar have only considered the inactivation of viruses in the liquid phase as a reliable mechanism for virus removal but have neglected irreversible attachment and solid phase inactivation of viruses abu ashour et al 1994 dillon et al 2008 therefore the qmra approach based on liquid phase inactivation of viruses may underestimate the virus removal during mar operations major processes controlling the transport and removal of viruses in porous media are advection dispersion attachment detachment and first order inactivation both liquid and solid phase schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 schijven et al 2002 the rate coefficient for attachment detachment liquid and solid phase inactivation is sensitive to many physicochemical factors such as flow dynamics porous media properties solution chemistry temperature residence time and pathogen physicochemical properties molnar et al 2015 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 the relative importance of these processes will determine the transport potential of viruses at mar sites regnery et al 2017 sidhu et al 2015 toze et al 2010 therefore several physicochemical and environmental factors may need to be optimized to ensure adequate virus removal during mar operations however no previous studies have investigated a range of virus removal parameters and their impact on groundwater quality when assessing the microbial risk from a drywell operation the local hydrogeology and subsurface heterogeneity at a mar site will influence the residence time which in turn affects the groundwater quality subsurface heterogeneity such as stratified or aggregated soils i e low and high conductive soil texture their horizontal and vertical process such as fractures faults macropores cracks and other preferential flow paths distribution and connectivity significantly impacts water flow in the subsurface dagan 2012 gelhar 1986 mantoglou and gelhar 1987 schilling et al 2017 xie et al 2014 yeh et al 1985a yeh et al 1985b our previous studies investigated the influence of stochastic subsurface heterogeneity parameters on cumulative infiltration and recharge volumes early and late arrival times and arrival points from a drywell under constant head conditions sasidharan et al 2019 sasidharan et al 2020 preferential flow paths or high permeable vertical or horizontally extended soil layers arnaud et al 2015 bradford et al 2017 can lead to the early arrival of pathogenic microbes at the water table or nearby drinking water wells therefore an understanding of the influence of subsurface heterogeneity on virus transport during the operation of a drywell is essential when assessing water quality however field scale transport experiments using pathogenic or indicator viruses poses many technical challenges in quantifying flow and transport processes and introduced pathogens create an unacceptable risk to human health therefore previous researchers have mainly conducted column scale virus experiments and inversely determined transport and fate parameters frohnert et al 2014 sasidharan et al 2017 schijven et al 2002 torkzaban et al 2006 this information can subsequently be used in numerical experiments to investigate expected virus behavior at the field scale torkzaban et al 2019 or specific mar sites nevertheless such efforts were not made before for a drywell operation the objective of this study is to demonstrate the application of numerical experiments using hydrus 2d 3d software coupled with column laboratory scale data to understand the influence of subsurface heterogeneity on virus transport where field scale studies are not feasible constant head water flow simulations were conducted to obtain steady state initial conditions in the flow domain to represent the worst case scenario for virus transport additional constant head simulations for virus transport were considered in a drywell to understand the effect of various removal parameters on virus transport under homogenous and different subsurface heterogeneity conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 mathematical model for water flow and virus transport hydrus 2d 3d was used to numerically solve the 2 dimensional axisymmetric form of the richards equation with the van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 unsaturated soil hydraulic functions mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the input parameters initial conditions and boundary conditions employed in these numerical experiments were generally based on results from drywells located in fort irwin ca sasidharan et al 2020 in brief the water level in the fort irwin drywell was continuously monitored using an in situ water level sensor and remote data acquisition techniques the falling head phase of a filling and draining cycle in the drywell during a storm event was selected for further analysis sasidharan et al 2018a sasidharan et al 2020 the observed falling head data from the drywell was used in conjunction with hydrus 2d 3d and the reservoir boundary condition module to inversely optimize the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k s 0 046 m day ¹ and the shape parameter in the soil water retention function α 9 17 m ¹ sasidharan et al 2018a šimůnek et al 2018 the residual soil water content θr 0 043 the saturated soil water content θs 0 39 and the pore size distribution parameter in the soil water retention function n 2 76 were derived from the measured particle size distribution silt clay fraction and the rosetta software schaap et al 2001 segal et al 2009 whereas the tortuosity parameter in the hydraulic conductivity function l was set to 0 5 sasidharan et al 2018b showed in column experiments that a small fraction of the injected virus was reversibly retained and not inactivated and the remaining fraction was irreversibly retained and inactivated on the solid phase a one site retention model did not account for the reversible virus fraction and observed low concentration tailing whereas a model with two kinetic retention sites and separate solid phase inactivation rates was needed to describe this behavior fig s1 two site kinetic retention may occur due to spatial variability in the flow field mass transfer strength of adhesive and retention mechanisms schijven and simunek 2002 in this work the hydrus 2d 3d computer code was used to simulate virus transport from a drywell under various virus removal and subsurface conditions šejna et al 2014 this model solves the two dimensional form of the advection dispersion equation with two kinetic retention sites having different attachment and detachment coefficients and solid phase inactivation rates the aqueous phase and solid phase mass balance equations for this application are given as 1a θ c t x i θ d i j w c x i q i c

2 0 min 1 the same value of μ s was assumed for both sites 1 and 2 according to filtration theory the value of k a is related to the average flow velocity as yao et al 1971 2 k a 3 2 1 n d c α η v

a constant head recharge simulation was conducted for 365 days to achieve steady state flow conditions sasidharan et al 2020 the flow domain and water flow boundary conditions are shown in fig 1 boundaries shown in blue were assigned a no flow boundary condition bc drywell s screened boundaries shown in red are constant head bcs that increase in a linear manner with depth and the green bottom boundary was a free drainage bc note that the free drainage condition assumes that the water table is deeper than 60 m such that the capillary fringe does not impact the simulation results the initial condition ic was specified in terms of the soil water pressure head h x z in this study the final pressure head from a recharge simulation in which the initial condition was set as a constant pressure head of 0 5 m for the entire flow domain sasidharan et al 2020 was imported into hydrus 2d 3d and employed as the initial condition e g fig s2 the steady state flow field i e calculate water contents and fluxes for the virus transport simulations was determined from this ic the flow domain was discretized using a two dimensional triangular finite element mesh with the meshgen tool available within hydrus 2d 3d šejna et al 2014 the mesh was refined such that the size of elements was smaller 0 05 0 25 m near the drywell where infiltration is simulated and the grid size was gradually increased with radial distance from the drywell with a maximum element size of 0 5 0 75 m the quality of the finite element mesh was assessed by ensuring the value of mass balance error reported by hydrus 2d 3d at the end of simulation was always below 1 for water flow and 2 3 for solute transport brunetti et al 2017 the unit of time in the simulations was set in minute and the initial time step was 0 001 min the minimum and maximum time steps were set at 0 0001 min and 1 min respectively the maximum number of iterations was set at 10 the water content tolerance was set at 0 0001 and pressure head tolerance was set at 0 01 m the solute transport boundary conditions are also shown in fig 1 in brief a no flux virus transport boundary condition was assigned to the upper boundary the nodes representing the right and lower left sides of the flow domain were set to no flux boundaries the nodes at z 8 7 to 38 m drywell sidewall and the bottom boundary z 60 m were assigned a third type cauchy mixed or solute flux boundary condition since the solute flux along a boundary is specified this type of boundary condition is mass conservative when the water flux is zero or directed out of the region third type boundary conditions are automatically switched to second type neumann boundary conditions šimunek et al 2012 the initial concentration of viruses at the flow domain was set as zero the initial input concentration of injection water from drywell c0 was set as 1 and the breakthrough curve btc at a specified location on the flow domain was determined as c c0 numerical experiments were conducted using hydrus 2d 3d to determine the appropriate groundwater separation distance for the safe operation of a drywell to minimize groundwater contamination at the water table from a virus that is 50 nm in size steady state water flow occurred in the simulation domain a conservative flow scenario while a 90 day step pulse of viruses was added to the drywell followed by 275 days of virus free water virus btcs were determined at depths of 1 4 6 13 and 22 m below the bottom of the drywell corresponding nodes at the left boundary of the flow domain were selected to represent a monitoring well located next to the drywell fig 1 a range of virus removal parameters was selected to optimize virus transport during the drywell operation tables 1 and 2 show a summary of virus transport and fate parameter combinations employed in all simulations the parameter ranges were selected to encompass reported values in the literature blanc and nasser 1996 bradford et al 2016 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 yahya et al 1993 and justification for inclusion or non inclusion of different transport processes are explained in section s1 1 of the supporting information fig 2 illustrates various virus removal processes in porous media considered in this study 2 2 1 homogeneous domain set i and ii simulations table 1 were conducted assuming a homogeneous domain and hydraulic parameters were measured for the fort irwin ca soil as described in section 2 1 set ia simulations investigated the effect of low values of irreversible attachment by varying α from 0 to 1 10 ³ additional simulations set ib table 1 were conducted to demonstrate the benefit of in situ iron oxide treatment near the drywell on virus removal using higher values of α 0 03 and 0 47 ryan et al 1999 set ii simulations were conducted to illustrate expected virus transport and removal when α 1 10 ⁴ and other fate parameters were considered seven scenarios were considered and are referred to as

influence of subsurface heterogeneity on virus fate from a drywell natural geological processes produce high permeable horizontal lenses and layers in soil texture and preferential water flow pathways in the vertical direction cracks micropores faults and other preferential flow paths the hydrus 2d 3d computer software has an option to generate stochastic distributions of hydraulic conductivity αk and pressure head αh scaling factors using the miller miller similitude approximation miller and miller 1956 the detailed methodology that was used to produce stochastic domains in hydrus 2d 3d is explained in our previous studies sasidharan et al 2019 sasidharan et al 2020 and is only briefly discussed in section s1 2 of the supporting information the following hypothetical combinations of scaling factors with variable σ σ 0 25 0 5 1 when x 1 m and z 0 1 m x x 0 1 1 10 m when σ 1 and z 0 1 m and z z 0 1 1 2 m when σ 1 and x 1 were used in virus transport simulations similar parameter ranges have been measured in the field freeze 1975 sudicky and macquarrie 1989 and employed in published modeling studies for other applications sasidharan et al 2019 sasidharan et al 2020 set iii simulations table 1 considered the detachment scenario for all seven stochastic domains set iv simulation table 1 only considered the detachment and reversible fraction μ s μ l scenarios for stochastic domains x 1 z 2 σ 1 and x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 under steady state flow conditions additional drywell simulations were conducted to demonstrate the application and upscaling of virus parameters obtained from a laboratory scale column to field scale studies set va simulations table 2 were conducted using virus removal parameters taken from saturated sand packed column experiments using bacteriophage prd1 at 20 c sasidharan et al 2018b set vb simulations table 2 were conducted using field scale prd1 removal parameters from a dune recharge site in the netherlands schijven et al 1999 3 result and discussions 3 1 homogeneous soil profiles 3 1 1 set i irreversible attachment numerical experiments were conducted to better understand the transport behavior of a virus from a drywell under steady state water flow conditions virus removal in soils has been reported to be controlled by attachment sasidharan et al 2018b set ia simulations irreversible attachment scenario were therefore conducted to investigate the effect of low levels of α low values of α were employed in these simulations to provide a best case greatest virus transport scenario to assess the potential risk to human health fig 3 a and b show the virus concentration log scale in the flow domain after 90 and 365 days respectively of steady state water flow when fr 0 k d 1 μ l μ s 0 min ¹ and α 0 1 10 ⁵ 1 10 ⁴ and 1 10 ³ note that readers could refer to fig s3 that explains various terms used in a representative btc graph to interpret data easily for all the btcs presented in this manuscript recall that the drywell contained virus for 90 days and then virus free water for another 275 days the highest virus concentration red reached the bottom boundary during the 90 day pulse injection when α 0 however the virus distribution around the drywell rapidly decreased with an increase in α and with the elution time comparison of fig 3a and b due to irreversible attachment note that the virus concentration in the domain pore water was almost completely eliminated after 365 days when α 1 10 ³ fig 4 shows the corresponding virus breakthrough curves btc c c0 on a log scale at depths of 1 4 6 13 and 22 m below the bottom of the drywell the virus concentration was higher than 6 log10 removal at 22 m after 90 days when α 0 1 10 ⁵ and 1 10 ⁴ in comparison the virus concentration was less than 6 log10 at 6 m when α 1 10 ³ however the virus concentration declined to less than 6 log10 after 365 days when α 1 10 ⁵ 1 10 ⁴ and 1 10 ³ the time for this observed decline at 4 m after 90 days pulse varies from 214 15 and 1 day for α 1 10 ⁵ 1 10 ⁴ and 1 10 ³ respectively prolonged concentration tailing was observed in btcs even though detachment was not considered this tailing behavior was more pronounced when the value of α was smaller this occurs because of physical nonequilibrium from the velocity distribution in the flow domain fig s4a in addition k a eq 2 is also a function of the flow velocity johnson et al 2007 shen et al 2010 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 syngouna et al 2017 torkzaban et al 2007 the treatment of soil material with metal oxides such as zero valent iron goethite manganese oxide and iron hydroxide has been found to greatly enhance the removal of microbial pathogens ahammed and meera 2010 kim et al 2008 li et al 2014 therefore set ib simulations were conducted to assess the potential benefit of iron oxide coating of soil adjacent to a drywell on virus removal reported values of α 0 03 and 0 47 for virus removal on iron oxide coated sand were employed for this purpose ryan et al 1999 a 6 log10 virus removal was obtained around the drywell within 1 5 m and 0 43 m in the horizontal and vertical direction respectively when α 0 47 fig s5a and within 1 9 m and 0 43 m when α 0 03 fig s5b these distances are much smaller than those shown in other simulation scenarios in this paper these results suggest that incorporating ex situ treatment and or in situ treatment zones into drywell designs may be needed to ensure that recharge water from a drywell is of acceptable microbial quality additional research is warranted to address this issue 3 1 2 set ii reversible attachment virus removal in the soil below a drywell depends on other parameters besides α set ii simulations were conducted to illustrate the expected transport and removal behavior when α 1 10 ⁴ and other virus fate parameters f r k d 1 μ l and μ s were varied fig 5 a f shows the virus btcs on a log scale at depths of 1 4 6 13 and 22 m below the bottom of the drywell when considering detachment liquid inactivation solid phase inactivation reversible fraction reversible fraction μ l and reversible fraction μ l μ s scenarios respectively figs s6a s6f show the corresponding virus concentration log scale in the flow domain after 90 and 365 days respectively note that all set ii simulations were nearly identical to the irreversible attachment scenario fig s6a for the first 90 days of virus injection in this case results were controlled by the same value of α 1 10 ⁴ in contrast pronounced differences occur after virus injection stopped and elution continued 90 days low levels of virus concentration tailing can occur during this time interval as a result of slow detachment k d 1 1 10 ⁵ m min ¹ and subsequent migration of viruses note that nonequilibrium viral mass transfer plays a larger role in concentration tailing fig 5a than physical nonequilibrium fig 4c when α 1 10 ⁴ the concentration tailing level and slope depend on the presence of liquid and solid phase inactivation and the fraction of reversible sites in general liquid fig 5b and especially solid phase fig 5c inactivation reduce the level and slope of concentration tailing in comparison to no inactivation fig 5a higher levels and less steep slopes of concentration tailing also occur for larger reversible fractions fig 5a b c in comparison to fig 5d e and f respectively the relative importance of concentration tailing also changes with depth the peak concentration of the btc 90 days is greater than the level of concentration tailing at lower depths 90 days in contrast the peak concentration of the btc can sometimes be lower than the level of concentration tailing at greater depths e g fig 5a this occurs because the level of concentration tailing is relatively stable with depth whereas the peak btc concentration strongly decreases with increasing depth due to attachment fig 4 3 2 heterogeneous soil profiles 3 2 1 set iii detachment scenario additional numerical experiments were conducted to better understand the influence of stochastic heterogeneity x 0 1 1 10 z 0 1 1 2 and σ 0 25 0 5 1 on virus transport during drywell operation steady state water flow occurred during these simulations by importing the initial pressure head fig s7 fig 6 shows the virus concentration distribution log scale after 365 days for set iii detachment scenario simulations increasing the x correlation length fig 6a b and c produces a wider distribution in the lateral direction whereas increasing the z correlation length fig 6d and e creates a greater vertical distribution of the virus fig s8 shows the virus btc log scale at 3 m and 22 m for all the stochastic parameter combinations parameters x 1 z 2 σ 1 produced the earliest arrival time and highest concentration at a depth of 22 m whereas parameters x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 resulted in the latest arrival time and lowest concentration among the stochastic parameter combinations fig s8 sasidharan et al 2020 demonstrated that the arrival time of recharge water at the water table highly depends on the stochastic heterogeneity for example the arrival time was 34 days in the x 1 z 2 σ 1 domain 66 days in the x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 domain and 100 days in the x 1 z 0 1 σ 0 25 domain the presence of highly permeable vertical lenses facilitates the faster downward movement of water in contrast the domain with high permeable horizontal lenses has increased water spreading in the lateral direction a small value of σ leads to a more uniform and lower permeability in the domain which takes longer to fill before the wetting front arrives at the bottom boundary besides the velocity distribution is also a function of stochastic parameters that lead to the physical nonequilibrium transport of viruses figs s4b and s4c therefore figs 6 and s8 confirm that the vertical flow path facilitates virus transport in contrast horizontally extended high permeable layers will initially promote the lateral distribution and removal of viruses before the viruses arrive at the water table even when a low detachment rate is present 3 2 2 set iv best case and worst case scenario set iv simulations only considered stochastic domains x 1 z 2 σ 1 and x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 under the worst case detachment and best case reversible fraction μ s μ l removal scenarios fig 7 a c and fig 8 a c show the virus concentration distribution in the x 1 z 2 σ 1 and x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 domains respectively after 365 days similarly fig 7b d and figs 8b d show the corresponding virus btc at depths of 1 4 6 13 and 22 m of the x 1 z 2 σ 1 and x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 domains respectively the virus concentration was above 6 log10 even at a depth of 22 m in both domains in the worst case detachment removal scenario the tail concentration increased due to slow detachment and subsequent migration of viruses in comparison to fig 8b x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 the x 1 z 2 σ 1 domain fig 7b produced rapidly increasing concentration tailing in the deep vadose zone 13 and 22 m due to the presence of higher velocities from permeable vertical lenses for the best case reversible fraction μ s μ l scenario the 6 log10 removal was achieved at a depth of 22 m of the x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 domain over 365 days figs 7d and 8d show that the time required to achieve 6 log10 removal after 90 days pulse at a depth of 13 m was 185 days and 105 days for the x 1 z 2 σ 1 and for x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 flow domains respectively fig 9 shows virus btcs for the worst case fig 9a and b and best case fig 9c and d removal scenarios at a depth of 22 m of the homogeneous and heterogeneous x 1 z 2 σ 1 and x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 domains fig 9a shows that the virus concentration remained 6 log10 for the x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 domain during the first 30 days of simulation whereas the concentration rapidly increased 6 log10 after 30 days fig 9b similarly the virus concentration remained 6 log10 in both homogeneous and x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 domains fig 9c however the concentration was 6 log10 during the 15 90 day injection period and declined rapidly in the homogeneous domain but the concentration always stayed 6 log10 in the x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 stochastic domain 3 2 3 set v real case scenarios sections 3 1 and 3 2 demonstrated the importance of site specific subsurface heterogeneity and virus removal parameters in microbial risk assessment parameters employed in those simulations purposely represent worst case removal scenarios to show the maximum microbial risk potential associated with drywell operation set va simulations were conducted using experimentally measured viral removal parameters to evaluate several real case scenarios using measured model parameters from field scale schijven et al 1999 or column scale sasidharan et al 2018b studies table 2 provides a summary of prd1 removal parameters from these studies used in set va simulations and the separation distance required to achieve a 6 log10 removal a 6 log10 removal of prd1 could be achieved within 1 8 m using column parameters sasidharan et al 2018 whereas 7 9 m was needed when using field scale parameters schijven et al 1999 the difference in the travel distance for the prd1 virus based on both column scale and field scale experiments can be explained by values of α these observations suggest that site specific measurements of virus transport and fate parameters ought to be employed to improve estimates of separation distance and microbial risk for example site specific virus removal parameters could be determined in small scale column studies and then employed in field scale modeling studies that account for site specific hydraulic properties and subsurface heterogeneity this approach would eliminate the need for tedious costly and time consuming experimental determination of virus transport and fate in the field note that virus concentrations for all the presented simulations in this study were collected from a single location at the specified depth fig 1 to represent the monitoring well next to the drywell which is the current common field scale practice worst case scenario in comparison fig s9 compares btcs for virus collected from a single point location one monitoring well with integrated values through the entire free drainage boundary at 22 m below drywell the integrated btc concentration was always lower than the point location consequently the btc for a point located close to the drywell will better predict the risk associated with an early arrival time than an integrated btc even though collecting an integrated btcs for the cone of infiltration of a drywell at a field site is not practical this study points out the benefit of installing and sampling multiple monitoring wells around the cone of infiltration fig s9 such field scale practice will help determine site specific groundwater microbial quality set back distance to drinking water wells and minimize under and overestimation of the risk from a drywell 4 future implications on regulatory standard current regulatory standards for drywells only require 1 5 to 13 m separation distance between the bottom of the drywell and the local groundwater table for various cities across the u s city of portland 2008 city of portland 2015 epa 1999 washington state department of ecology 2006 the results from figs 4 9 s6 s8 s9 and s10 clearly demonstrate that these regulatory standards may sometimes be inadequate to achieve a 6 log10 removal of viruses even at a depth of 22 m below the bottom of a drywell the virus concentration was highly dependent on α during virus injections 90 days but was then controlled by small rates of detachment previous researchers have assumed that the threat from virus detachment was minimal schijven et al 1999 however this study showed that small α and k d values can lead to prolonged migration and release of viruses that can adversely impact groundwater quality even for a deep water table the threat of virus transport will be mitigated for larger α smaller reversible fractions and detachment rates and higher solid and liquid inactivation rates additional research is warranted to better understand and quantify these site specific parameters that contribute to long term concentration tailing this information could be used in mar guidelines and engineering approaches to minimize microbial contamination of groundwater figs 7 and 8 confirm that the separation distance to achieve 6 log10 virus removal is a function of both virus removal parameters and stochastic subsurface heterogeneity at a specific site the presence of a vertically extended lens facilitates the rapid transport of viruses and result in an early arrival at the groundwater table in contrast horizontally extended lenses increase the lateral spreading and the travel time enhancing virus removal by irreversible attachment and solid phase inactivation and limited vertical migration therefore these factors should be considered in microbial risk assessment and separation distance requirements the generalized use of a constant separation distance may overestimate virus removal via vadose zone treatment and potentially lead to groundwater contamination fig 9 indicates that the general assumption of a 1 5 12 m separation distance may not be adequate in some instances and the timing of the water quality monitoring can significantly underestimate the potential future groundwater viral contamination these observations are consistent with reported waterborne disease outbreaks in highly heterogeneous e g fractured and karst subsurface environments borchardt et al 2011 wallender et al 2014 predictions of contaminant transport in stochastic systems mantoglou and gelhar 1987 yeh et al 1985a yeh et al 1985b and simulated variations in recharge arrival times and locations below a drywell sasidharan et al 2020 however we acknowledge that the microbial risk from recharged groundwater to public health depends on various factors such as the exposure pathways volume of injection and microbial concentration frequency of exposure the infectivity of the pathogen setback distance to the drinking water well removal within the treatment train framework and post treatment of recovered water in contrast this study explicitly points out the potential for groundwater contamination when vadose zone treatment is considered as the primary treatment barrier during mar operation 5 conclusions numerical modeling was used to study virus transport from a drywell and the potential risk of groundwater contamination under various virus removal and subsurface heterogeneity scenarios the separation distance between the bottom of the drywell and the bottom of the flow domain to achieve a 6 log10 removal of the virus was typically much larger than the currently recommended guideline of 1 5 to 13 m higher risks of groundwater contamination from prolonged virus concentration tailing in the deep vadose zone occurred for lower values of the sticking efficiency and liquid and solid phase inactivation rates and higher detachment rates and reversible fractions conversely the risk from viruses can be minimized by increasing the sticking efficiency solid phase inactivation and irreversible fraction of the soil around the drywell for example in situ treatment with iron oxide with high sticking efficiency was found to create 6 log10 virus removal within 1 9 m from the drywell sasidharan et al 2017a 2018b demonstrated that up to 4 6 log removal of virus could be achieved by increasing the storage or residence time in a column experiment at 20 c therefore virus risk is also expected to be minimized by transient drywell operation that increases the residence time for irreversible attachment and solid phase inactivation virus transport under transient conditions also involves additional processes under unsaturated conditions such as retention at the air water interface or remobilization during water imbibition therefore transient water flow simulations were not considered in this study but warrants additional research site specific sub surface heterogeneity and hydraulic property will also influence virus transport horizontally extended lenses with high permeability enhance the lateral distribution and removal of the virus conversely vertically extended high permeable lenses such as fractures and preferential flow pathways facilitate virus transport and will result in the rapid arrival of viruses at the groundwater table this research illustrates that site specific virus removal parameters obtained from the field or column scale experiments can be employed in field scale modeling studies to assess risks from virus contamination and determine needed separation distances this same approach and findings are expected to be applicable for other mar systems e g ag mar and infiltration basins as well as for septic tanks and leach fields when vadose zone transport is considered as a treatment barrier credit authorship contribution statement

17017,many arid and semi arid regions of the world face challenges in maintaining the water quantity and quality needs of growing populations a drywell is an engineered vadose zone infiltration device widely used for stormwater capture and managed aquifer recharge to our knowledge no prior studies have quantitatively examined virus transport from a drywell especially in the presence of subsurface heterogeneity axisymmetric numerical experiments were conducted to systematically study virus fate from a drywell for various virus removal and subsurface heterogeneity scenarios under steady state flow conditions from a constant head reservoir subsurface domains were homogeneous or had stochastic heterogeneity with selected standard deviation σ of lognormal distribution in saturated hydraulic conductivity and horizontal x and vertical z correlation lengths low levels of virus concentration tailing can occur even at a separation distance of 22 m from the bottom of the drywell and 6 log10 virus removal was not achieved when a small detachment rate k d 1 1 10 ⁵ min ¹ is present in a homogeneous domain improved virus removal was achieved at a depth of 22 m in the presence of horizontal lenses e g x 10 m z 0 1 m σ 1 that enhanced the lateral movement and distribution of the virus in contrast faster downward movement of the virus with an early arrival time at a depth of 22 m occurred when considering a vertical correlation in permeability x 1 m z 2 m σ 1 therefore the general assumption of a 1 5 12 m separation distance to protect water quality may not be adequate in some instances and site specific microbial risk assessment is essential to minimize risk microbial water quality can potentially be improved by using an in situ soil treatment with iron oxides to increase

microbial risks from mar techniques therefore need to be assessed to ensure adequate protection of groundwater quality and public health microbial risk assessment is an evaluation process to determine the likelihood of adverse human health effects following exposure to pathogenic microorganisms from various sources soller 2009 one of the commonly advocated methods for assessing microbial risks in recycled water systems is static quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra nrmmc ephc ahmc 2006 soller and eisenberg 2008 who 1993 static qmra focuses on estimating the probability of infection to an individual due to a single exposure event soller and eisenberg 2008 the qmra approach requires quantitative input data for pathogen occurrence in the source water and their removal through treatment barriers nrmmc ephc ahmc 2006 who 1993 appropriate quantification of input data and the selection of numerical values for each variable is critical for a successful risk assessment the parameters for qmra include the evaluation of pathogen source concentration an infectious dose of individual pathogen dose response assessment to estimate a risk of response infection illness or death human behavior water consumption pattern and the daily intake volume disease incidence of the local community as well as operational design and performance of the treatment barriers blokker et al 2014 qmrawiki 2014 when mar is used as a treatment barrier and recharge option for groundwater management the parameterization requires an understanding of pathogen transport and removal processes in the aquifer the residence time in an aquifer has been found to play a pivotal role in allowing biological and chemical processes to improve the water quality dillon et al 2003 toze et al 2010 the residence time for a drywell depends on the setback distance between the drywell and a drinking water well city of portland 2008 city of portland 2015 epa 1999 washington state department of ecology 2006 however current regulatory guidelines to protect groundwater quality require an additional separation distance between the bottom of the drywell and the local groundwater table of 1 5 to 13 m city of portland 2008 city of portland 2015 epa 1999 washington state department of ecology 2006 several field and laboratory scale experiments and numerical modeling approaches have been used to study virus removal and assess risk during mar anders and chrysikopoulos 2008 jin and flury 2002 powelson and gerba 1994 stevenson et al 2015 toze et al 2010 conducted an in situ decay study at a mar site and 1 log reduction for rotavirus was calculated as a function of residence time to be 34 days toze et al 2010 however the mar guideline evaluates the effectiveness of aquifer treatment expressed as log reductions to meet the human health based microbial target of 1 10 ⁶ dalys disability adjusted life years 6 log10 per person per year as a function of residence time nrmmc ephc ahmc 2006 page et al 2018 current guidelines for mar have only considered the inactivation of viruses in the liquid phase as a reliable mechanism for virus removal but have neglected irreversible attachment and solid phase inactivation of viruses abu ashour et al 1994 dillon et al 2008 therefore the qmra approach based on liquid phase inactivation of viruses may underestimate the virus removal during mar operations major processes controlling the transport and removal of viruses in porous media are advection dispersion attachment detachment and first order inactivation both liquid and solid phase schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 schijven et al 2002 the rate coefficient for attachment detachment liquid and solid phase inactivation is sensitive to many physicochemical factors such as flow dynamics porous media properties solution chemistry temperature residence time and pathogen physicochemical properties molnar et al 2015 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 the relative importance of these processes will determine the transport potential of viruses at mar sites regnery et al 2017 sidhu et al 2015 toze et al 2010 therefore several physicochemical and environmental factors may need to be optimized to ensure adequate virus removal during mar operations however no previous studies have investigated a range of virus removal parameters and their impact on groundwater quality when assessing the microbial risk from a drywell operation the local hydrogeology and subsurface heterogeneity at a mar site will influence the residence time which in turn affects the groundwater quality subsurface heterogeneity such as stratified or aggregated soils i e low and high conductive soil texture their horizontal and vertical process such as fractures faults macropores cracks and other preferential flow paths distribution and connectivity significantly impacts water flow in the subsurface dagan 2012 gelhar 1986 mantoglou and gelhar 1987 schilling et al 2017 xie et al 2014 yeh et al 1985a yeh et al 1985b our previous studies investigated the influence of stochastic subsurface heterogeneity parameters on cumulative infiltration and recharge volumes early and late arrival times and arrival points from a drywell under constant head conditions sasidharan et al 2019 sasidharan et al 2020 preferential flow paths or high permeable vertical or horizontally extended soil layers arnaud et al 2015 bradford et al 2017 can lead to the early arrival of pathogenic microbes at the water table or nearby drinking water wells therefore an understanding of the influence of subsurface heterogeneity on virus transport during the operation of a drywell is essential when assessing water quality however field scale transport experiments using pathogenic or indicator viruses poses many technical challenges in quantifying flow and transport processes and introduced pathogens create an unacceptable risk to human health therefore previous researchers have mainly conducted column scale virus experiments and inversely determined transport and fate parameters frohnert et al 2014 sasidharan et al 2017 schijven et al 2002 torkzaban et al 2006 this information can subsequently be used in numerical experiments to investigate expected virus behavior at the field scale torkzaban et al 2019 or specific mar sites nevertheless such efforts were not made before for a drywell operation the objective of this study is to demonstrate the application of numerical experiments using hydrus 2d 3d software coupled with column laboratory scale data to understand the influence of subsurface heterogeneity on virus transport where field scale studies are not feasible constant head water flow simulations were conducted to obtain steady state initial conditions in the flow domain to represent the worst case scenario for virus transport additional constant head simulations for virus transport were considered in a drywell to understand the effect of various removal parameters on virus transport under homogenous and different subsurface heterogeneity conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 mathematical model for water flow and virus transport hydrus 2d 3d was used to numerically solve the 2 dimensional axisymmetric form of the richards equation with the van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 unsaturated soil hydraulic functions mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the input parameters initial conditions and boundary conditions employed in these numerical experiments were generally based on results from drywells located in fort irwin ca sasidharan et al 2020 in brief the water level in the fort irwin drywell was continuously monitored using an in situ water level sensor and remote data acquisition techniques the falling head phase of a filling and draining cycle in the drywell during a storm event was selected for further analysis sasidharan et al 2018a sasidharan et al 2020 the observed falling head data from the drywell was used in conjunction with hydrus 2d 3d and the reservoir boundary condition module to inversely optimize the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k s 0 046 m day ¹ and the shape parameter in the soil water retention function α 9 17 m ¹ sasidharan et al 2018a šimůnek et al 2018 the residual soil water content θr 0 043 the saturated soil water content θs 0 39 and the pore size distribution parameter in the soil water retention function n 2 76 were derived from the measured particle size distribution silt clay fraction and the rosetta software schaap et al 2001 segal et al 2009 whereas the tortuosity parameter in the hydraulic conductivity function l was set to 0 5 sasidharan et al 2018b showed in column experiments that a small fraction of the injected virus was reversibly retained and not inactivated and the remaining fraction was irreversibly retained and inactivated on the solid phase a one site retention model did not account for the reversible virus fraction and observed low concentration tailing whereas a model with two kinetic retention sites and separate solid phase inactivation rates was needed to describe this behavior fig s1 two site kinetic retention may occur due to spatial variability in the flow field mass transfer strength of adhesive and retention mechanisms schijven and simunek 2002 in this work the hydrus 2d 3d computer code was used to simulate virus transport from a drywell under various virus removal and subsurface conditions šejna et al 2014 this model solves the two dimensional form of the advection dispersion equation with two kinetic retention sites having different

boundary was a free drainage bc note that the free drainage condition assumes that the water table is deeper than 60 m such that the capillary fringe does not impact the simulation results the initial

hydrus 2d 3d šejna et al 2014 the mesh was refined such that the size of elements was smaller 0 05 0 25 m near the drywell where infiltration is simulated and the grid size was gradually increased with radial distance from the drywell with a maximum element size of 0 5 0 75 m the quality of the finite element mesh was assessed by ensuring the value of mass balance error reported by hydrus 2d 3d at the end of simulation was always below 1 for water flow and 2 3 for solute transport brunetti et al 2017 the unit of time in the simulations was set in minute and the initial time step was 0 001 min the minimum and maximum time steps were set at 0 0001 min and 1 min respectively the maximum number of iterations was set at 10 the water content tolerance was set at 0 0001 and pressure head tolerance was set at 0 01 m the solute transport boundary conditions are also shown in fig 1 in brief a no flux virus transport boundary condition was assigned to the upper boundary the nodes representing the right and lower left sides of the flow domain were set to no flux boundaries the nodes at z 8 7 to 38 m drywell sidewall and the bottom boundary z 60 m were assigned a third type cauchy mixed or solute flux boundary condition since the solute flux along a boundary is specified this type of boundary condition is mass conservative when the water flux is zero or directed out of the region third type boundary conditions are automatically switched to second type neumann boundary conditions šimunek et al 2012 the initial concentration of viruses at the flow domain was set as zero the initial input concentration of injection water from drywell c0 was set as 1 and the breakthrough curve btc at a specified location on the flow domain was determined as c c0 numerical

6 log10 at 6 m when α 1 10 ³ however the virus concentration declined to less than 6 log10 after 365 days when α 1 10 ⁵ 1 10 ⁴ and 1 10 ³ the time for this observed decline at 4 m after 90 days pulse varies from 214 15 and 1 day for α 1 10 ⁵ 1 10 ⁴ and 1 10 ³ respectively prolonged concentration tailing was observed in btcs even though detachment was not considered this tailing behavior was more pronounced when the value of α was smaller this occurs because of physical nonequilibrium from the velocity distribution in the flow domain fig s4a in addition k a eq 2 is also a function of the flow velocity johnson et al 2007 shen et al 2010 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2013 syngouna et al 2017 torkzaban et al 2007 the treatment of soil material with metal oxides such as zero valent iron goethite manganese oxide and iron hydroxide has been found to greatly enhance the removal of microbial pathogens ahammed and meera 2010 kim et al 2008 li et al 2014 therefore set ib simulations were conducted to assess the potential benefit of iron oxide coating of soil adjacent to a drywell on virus removal reported values of α 0 03 and 0 47 for virus removal on iron oxide coated sand were employed for this purpose ryan et al 1999 a 6 log10 virus removal was obtained around the drywell within 1 5 m and 0 43 m in the horizontal and vertical direction respectively when α 0 47 fig s5a and within 1 9 m and 0 43 m when α 0 03 fig s5b these distances are much smaller than those shown in other simulation scenarios in this paper these results suggest that incorporating ex situ treatment and or in situ treatment zones into drywell designs may be needed to ensure that recharge water from a drywell is of acceptable microbial quality additional research is warranted to address this issue 3 1 2 set ii reversible attachment virus removal in the soil below a drywell depends on other parameters besides α set ii simulations were conducted to illustrate the expected transport and removal behavior when α 1 10 ⁴ and other virus fate parameters f r k d 1 μ l and μ s were varied fig 5 a f shows the virus btcs on a log scale at depths of 1 4 6 13 and 22 m below the bottom of the drywell when considering detachment liquid inactivation solid phase inactivation reversible fraction reversible fraction μ l and reversible fraction μ l μ s scenarios respectively figs s6a s6f show the corresponding virus concentration log scale in the flow domain after 90 and 365 days respectively note that all set ii simulations were nearly identical to the irreversible attachment scenario fig s6a for the first 90 days of virus injection in this case results were controlled by the same value of α 1 10 ⁴ in contrast pronounced differences occur after virus injection stopped and elution continued 90 days low levels of virus concentration tailing can occur during this time interval as a result of slow detachment k d 1 1 10 ⁵ m min ¹ and subsequent migration of viruses note that nonequilibrium viral mass transfer plays a larger role in concentration tailing fig 5a than physical nonequilibrium fig 4c when α 1 10 ⁴ the concentration tailing level and slope depend on the presence of liquid and solid phase inactivation and the fraction of reversible sites in general liquid fig 5b and especially solid phase fig 5c inactivation reduce the level and slope of concentration tailing in comparison to no inactivation fig 5a higher levels and less steep slopes of concentration tailing also occur for larger reversible fractions fig 5a b c in comparison to fig 5d e and f respectively the relative importance of concentration tailing also changes with depth the peak concentration of the btc 90 days is greater than the level of concentration tailing at lower depths 90 days in contrast the peak concentration of the btc can sometimes be lower than the level of concentration tailing at greater depths e g fig 5a this occurs because the level of concentration tailing is relatively stable with depth whereas the peak btc concentration strongly decreases with increasing depth due to attachment fig 4 3 2 heterogeneous soil profiles 3 2 1 set iii detachment scenario additional numerical experiments were conducted to better understand the influence of stochastic heterogeneity x 0 1 1 10 z 0 1 1 2 and σ 0 25 0 5 1 on virus transport during drywell operation steady state water flow occurred during these simulations by importing the initial pressure head fig s7 fig 6 shows the virus concentration distribution log scale after 365 days for set iii detachment scenario simulations increasing the x correlation length fig 6a b and c produces a wider distribution in the lateral direction whereas increasing the z correlation length fig 6d and e creates a greater vertical distribution of the virus fig s8 shows the virus btc log scale at 3 m and 22 m for all the stochastic parameter combinations parameters x 1 z 2 σ 1 produced the earliest arrival time and highest concentration at a depth of 22 m whereas parameters x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 resulted in the latest arrival time and lowest concentration among the stochastic parameter combinations fig s8 sasidharan et al 2020 demonstrated that the arrival time of recharge water at the water table highly depends on the stochastic heterogeneity for example the arrival time was 34 days in the x 1 z 2 σ 1 domain 66 days in the x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 domain and 100 days in the x 1 z 0 1 σ 0 25 domain the presence of highly permeable vertical lenses facilitates the faster downward movement of water in contrast the domain with high permeable horizontal lenses has increased water spreading in the lateral direction a small value of σ leads to a more uniform and lower permeability in the domain which takes longer to fill before the wetting front arrives at the bottom boundary besides the velocity distribution is also a function of stochastic parameters that lead to the physical nonequilibrium transport of viruses figs s4b and s4c therefore figs 6 and s8 confirm that the vertical flow path facilitates virus transport in contrast horizontally extended high permeable layers will initially promote the lateral distribution and removal of viruses before the viruses arrive at the water table even when a low detachment rate is present 3 2 2 set iv best case and worst case scenario set iv simulations only considered stochastic domains x 1 z 2 σ 1 and x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 under the worst case detachment and best case reversible fraction μ s μ l removal scenarios fig 7 a c and fig 8 a c show the virus concentration distribution in the x 1 z 2 σ 1 and x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 domains respectively after 365 days similarly fig 7b d and figs 8b d show the corresponding virus btc at depths of 1 4 6 13 and 22 m of the x 1 z 2 σ 1 and x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 domains respectively the virus concentration was above 6 log10 even at a depth of 22 m in both domains in the worst case detachment removal scenario the tail concentration increased due to slow detachment and subsequent migration of viruses in comparison to fig 8b x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 the x 1 z 2 σ 1 domain fig 7b produced rapidly increasing concentration tailing in the deep vadose zone 13 and 22 m due to the presence of higher velocities from permeable vertical lenses for the best case reversible fraction μ s μ l scenario the 6 log10 removal was achieved at a depth of 22 m of the x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 domain over 365 days figs 7d and 8d show that the time required to achieve 6 log10 removal after 90 days pulse at a depth of 13 m was 185 days and 105 days for the x 1 z 2 σ 1 and for x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 flow domains respectively fig 9 shows virus btcs for the worst case fig 9a and b and best case fig 9c and d removal scenarios at a depth of 22 m of the homogeneous and heterogeneous x 1 z 2 σ 1 and x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 domains fig 9a shows that the virus concentration remained 6 log10 for the x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 domain during the first 30 days of simulation whereas the concentration rapidly increased 6 log10 after 30 days fig 9b similarly the virus concentration remained 6 log10 in both homogeneous and x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 domains fig 9c however the concentration was 6 log10 during the 15 90 day injection period and declined rapidly in the homogeneous domain but the concentration always stayed 6 log10 in the x 10 z 0 1 σ 1 stochastic domain 3 2 3 set v real case scenarios sections 3 1 and 3 2 demonstrated the importance of site specific subsurface heterogeneity and virus removal parameters in microbial risk assessment parameters employed in those simulations purposely represent worst case removal scenarios to show the maximum microbial risk potential associated with drywell operation set va simulations were conducted using experimentally measured viral removal parameters to evaluate several real case scenarios using measured model parameters from field scale schijven et al 1999 or column scale sasidharan et al 2018b studies table 2 provides a summary of prd1 removal parameters from these studies used in set va simulations and the separation distance required to achieve a 6 log10 removal a 6 log10 removal of prd1 could be achieved within 1 8 m using column parameters sasidharan et al 2018 whereas 7 9 m was needed when using field scale parameters schijven et al 1999 the difference in the travel distance for the prd1 virus based on both column scale and field scale experiments can be explained by values of α these observations suggest that site specific measurements of virus transport and fate parameters ought to be employed to improve estimates of separation distance and microbial risk for example site specific virus removal parameters could be determined in small scale column studies and then employed in field scale modeling studies that account for site specific hydraulic properties and subsurface heterogeneity this approach would eliminate the need for tedious costly and time consuming experimental determination of virus transport and fate in the field note that virus concentrations for all the presented simulations in this study were collected from a single location at the specified depth fig 1 to represent the monitoring well next to the drywell which is the current common field scale practice worst case scenario in comparison fig s9 compares btcs for virus collected from a single point location one monitoring well with integrated values through the entire free drainage boundary at 22 m below drywell the integrated btc concentration was always lower than the point location consequently the btc for a point located close to the drywell will better predict the risk associated with an early arrival time than an integrated btc even though collecting an integrated btcs for the cone of infiltration of a drywell at a field site is not practical this study points out the benefit of installing and sampling multiple monitoring wells around the cone of infiltration fig s9 such field scale practice will help determine site specific groundwater microbial quality set back distance to drinking water wells and minimize under and overestimation of the risk from a drywell 4 future implications on regulatory standard current regulatory standards for drywells only require 1 5 to 13 m separation distance between the bottom of the drywell and the local groundwater table for various cities across the u s city of portland 2008 city of portland 2015 epa 1999 washington state department of ecology 2006 the results from figs 4 9 s6 s8 s9 and s10 clearly demonstrate that these regulatory standards may sometimes be inadequate to achieve a 6 log10 removal of viruses even at a depth of 22 m below the bottom of a drywell the virus concentration was highly dependent on α during virus injections 90 days but was then controlled by small rates of detachment previous researchers have assumed that the threat from virus detachment was minimal schijven et al 1999 however this study showed that small α and k d values can lead to prolonged migration and release of viruses that can adversely impact groundwater quality even for a deep water table the threat of virus transport will be mitigated for larger α smaller reversible fractions and detachment rates and higher solid and liquid inactivation rates additional research is warranted to better understand and quantify these site specific parameters that contribute to long term concentration tailing this information could be used in mar guidelines and engineering approaches to minimize microbial contamination of groundwater figs 7 and 8 confirm that the separation distance to achieve 6 log10 virus removal is a function of both virus removal parameters and stochastic subsurface heterogeneity at a specific site the presence of a vertically extended lens facilitates the rapid transport of viruses and result in an early arrival at the groundwater table in contrast horizontally extended lenses increase the lateral spreading and the travel time enhancing virus removal by irreversible attachment and solid phase inactivation and limited vertical migration therefore these factors should be considered in microbial risk assessment and separation distance requirements the generalized use of a constant separation distance may overestimate virus removal via vadose zone treatment and potentially lead to groundwater contamination fig 9 indicates that the general assumption of a 1 5 12 m separation distance may not be adequate in some instances and the timing of the water quality monitoring can significantly underestimate the potential future groundwater viral contamination these observations are consistent with reported waterborne disease outbreaks in highly heterogeneous e g fractured and karst subsurface environments borchardt et al 2011 wallender et al 2014 predictions of contaminant transport in stochastic systems mantoglou and gelhar 1987 yeh et al 1985a yeh et al 1985b and simulated variations in recharge arrival times and locations below a drywell sasidharan et al 2020 however we acknowledge that the microbial risk from recharged groundwater to public health depends on various factors such as the exposure pathways volume of injection and microbial concentration frequency of exposure the infectivity of the pathogen setback distance to the drinking water well removal within the treatment train framework and post treatment of recovered water in contrast this study explicitly points out the potential for groundwater contamination when vadose zone treatment is considered as the primary treatment barrier during mar operation 5 conclusions numerical modeling was used to study virus transport from a drywell and the potential risk of groundwater contamination under various virus removal and subsurface heterogeneity scenarios the separation distance between the bottom of the drywell and the bottom of the flow domain to achieve a 6 log10 removal of the virus was typically much larger than the currently recommended guideline of 1 5 to 13 m higher risks of groundwater contamination from prolonged virus concentration tailing in the deep vadose zone occurred for lower values of the sticking efficiency and liquid and solid phase inactivation rates and higher detachment rates and reversible fractions conversely the risk from viruses can be minimized by increasing the sticking efficiency solid phase inactivation and irreversible fraction of the soil around the drywell for example in situ treatment with iron oxide with high sticking efficiency was found to create 6 log10 virus removal within 1 9 m from the drywell sasidharan et al 2017a 2018b demonstrated that up to 4 6 log removal of virus could be achieved by increasing the storage or residence time in a column experiment at 20 c therefore virus risk is also expected to be minimized by transient drywell operation that increases the residence time for irreversible attachment and solid phase inactivation virus transport under transient conditions also involves additional processes under unsaturated conditions such as retention at the air water interface or remobilization during water imbibition therefore transient water flow simulations were not considered in this study but warrants additional research site specific sub surface heterogeneity and hydraulic property will also influence virus transport horizontally extended lenses with high permeability enhance the lateral distribution and removal of the virus conversely vertically extended high permeable lenses such as fractures and preferential flow pathways facilitate virus transport and will result in the rapid arrival of viruses at the groundwater table this research illustrates that site specific virus removal parameters obtained from the field or column scale experiments can be employed in field scale modeling studies to assess risks from virus contamination and determine needed separation distances this same approach and findings are expected to be applicable for other mar systems e g ag mar and infiltration basins as well as for septic tanks and leach fields when vadose zone transport is considered as a treatment barrier credit authorship contribution statement

surfaces using a quartz crystal microbalance mehnaz shams iftaykhairul alam indranil chowdhury department of civil environmental engineering washington state university pullman wa 99164 usa department of civil environmental engineering washington state university pullman wa 99164 usa department of civil environmental engineering washington state university pullman wa 99164 usa corresponding author interactions of nanoscale plastics with natural organic matter nom and silica surfaces were investigated using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring qcm d polyethylene and polystyrene are the most used plastic polymers and most likely to accumulate in the environment and thus their nano scale interactions were investigated in this study deposition and release of polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics were investigated on silica and nom coated surfaces in the presence of different salt types nacl cacl2 mgcl2 and ionic strengths is polyethylene nanoscale plastics showed negligible deposition on silica surface while significant deposition of polystyrene nanoscale plastics was observed on silica surface however both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics showed significant deposition on nom coated surfaces with polystyrene showing higher deposition increased is resulted in greater deposition of both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics on nom coated surfaces due to the functional groups following dlvo theory deposited polyethylene nanoscale plastics on nom coated surfaces can be remobilized whereas deposition of polystyrene nanoscale plastics was irreversible on both silica and nom coated surfaces overall higher deposition of nanoscale plastics on nom coated surfaces indicates that fate and mobility of nanoscale plastics in the environment will be significantly governed by their interactions with nom graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoplastics polyethylene polystyrene natural organic matter qcm d interactions 1 introduction plastic possesses some outstanding properties such as resistance to water high tensile and flexural strengths and low manufacturing and optimization cost scott 1999 however if they are not recycled then these useful features would result in their accumulation in the environment this plastic accumulation is becoming a serious problem all over the world plastics dumped into the environment after usage or from wwtp or drains goes into the rivers and lakes and eventually ends up in oceans through rainfall or wind scott 1999 browne et al 2011 polyethylene a polymer made of long chains of ethylene monomers is one of the most commonly detected plastic in the environment wright et al 2013 gewert et al 2015 it is generally used in grocery bags milk cartons food packaging straws among others due to being strong lightweight and durable thompson et al 2009 andrady 2011 polystyrene plastic is also one of the most commonly used aromatic recalcitrant polymer made from a liquid hydrocarbon monomer styrene that is commercially produced from petroleum scheirs and priddy 2003 ojeda 2013 this plastic is used in the manufacturing process of different items for example plastic laboratory consumables disposable drinking cups and packaging material gausepohl and nießner 2001 it is a highly used and detected plastic in the environment because it is comparatively cheaper than many other plastics and is disposed of after only a single use as they cannot resist heat above 100 c da costa et al 2016 after the usage and disposal into the environment these recalcitrant plastics accumulate and degrade to micro 0 1 5 mm and nanoplastics 100 nm via processes such as chemical mechanical biological processes wright et al 2013 jahnke et al 2017 due to their high surface area these nanoscale plastics can sorb organic pollutants like organochlorine pesticides polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes dioxins and metal besseling et al 2012 rochman et al 2013 this could be toxic to the aquatic organisms and other wildlife that ingests micro or nanoscale plastics moreover despite the high removal of microplastics in some treatment plants talvitie et al 2017 lares et al 2018 bayo et al 2020 large amounts of microplastics still get release into the river due to the high volume of effluent produced as well as the huge loading of plastics that enters the treatment plant alavian et al alavian petroody et al 2020 stated that the high discharge rate of treated effluent 22 000 m3 d results in a total emission of more than 9 3 million microplastics d to the environment similarly another study showed that around 8 trillion microplastics enter the aquatic environment through wwtps rochman et al 2015 some of which can also end up in drinking water tap kosuth et al 2017 cox et al 2019 even though currently the effects of micro or nanoscale plastics on human health remains unknown micro or nanoscale plastics like nanomaterials can penetrate cell barrier and cause cytotoxicity and other metabolic disorder syberg et al 2015 overall plastic pollution and accumulation is a growing concern for human health as well as for environment which necessitates the study of fate and transport of microplastics in the natural aquatic environment previous studies have shown that solution chemistries and presence of nom can influence the fate and transport of different engineered nanomaterials presence of nom can cause nanomaterial stabilization and even lead to the resuspension or redispersion of formed nanomaterial aggregates chowdhury et al 2013 lanphere et al 2014 previous studies have suggested that due to their size and colloidal particulate nature parallels can be drawn between fate research of engineered nanomaterials and microplastics hüffer et al 2017 this observation was assessed in different studies by showing that presence of nom can stabilize micro and nanoscale plastics like engineered nanomaterials cai et al 2018 shams et al 2020 this stabilization was mainly attributed to the steric repulsion caused by nom this can lead to the reduced aggregation reduced deposition and extensive transport of nanoplastics alimi et al 2018 due to the ubiquitous nature of nom sediments and other surfaces i e sand in the natural system could be coated with nom and it could be hypothesized that this could facilitate the attachment of negatively charged nanoscale plastics to these surface and govern their fate and transport behavior philippe and schaumann 2014 ateia et al 2020 so in a potential micro or nanoscale plastics release in the aquatic environment silica or nom coated surfaces can be one of the important factors controlling their fate in the environment however the inherent physical and chemical characteristics of plastics differ from other nanoparticles such as adsorption formation of eco corona biofilm which would affect the interactions of plastics in aquatic environment yet there has been no study on interactions of micro or nanoscale plastics with nom and silica surfaces moreover the release and remobilization of micro or nanoscale plastics deposited on different surfaces can impact the fate of this emerging contaminants in the environment in this study fundamental mechanisms governing interactions deposition and release of polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics with model surfaces common to the environment silica i e sand surface nom coated surfaces were investigated under various salt types nacl cacl2 mgcl2 and ionic strength using qcm d the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring qcm d has been used to characterize nanomaterial deposition onto different model surfaces chen and elimelech 2008 chowdhury et al 2014a qcm d is a sensitive method to measure mass deposition it employs a piezoelectric quartz crystal that oscillates laterally and its resonant frequency and odd overtones change to attached mass moreover qcm d can indicate the rigidity or softness of the deposited material layer to the silica surface by taking the ratio of frequency and dissipation previously researchers have observed the deposition of other nanomaterials on a collector surface in both column experiments and qcm d chowdhury et al 2014a however to the best of our knowledge interactions of nanoscale plastics with qcm d is still unexplored which will help understanding the interactions of these plastics more accurately and predicting their fate and mobility in the environment polyethylene and polystyrene were chosen as model plastics as they are the most widely produced and commonly found plastics lu et al 2009 rao and geckeler 2011 these laboratory experiments can help elucidating the fate and mobility of these nanoscale plastics in the natural environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 nanoscale plastics preparation the stock solution of polyethylene nanoscale plastic was prepared by mixing polyethylene nanospheres 200nm 9900 nm diameter 0 95 g cc density from cospheric llc ca usa beiras et al 2018 with deionized water and 0 1 wt sodium dodecyl sulfate sds strano et al 2003 péron et al 2007 the stock solution of polystyrene latex particles surface functionalized with carboxyl groups was prepared by diluting the original suspension purchased from thermo fisher scientific 4 w v with diameter of 20 nm cai et al 2018 shams et al 2020 both the solutions were prepared in the concentration of 40 mg l 1 and their characterization results are provided in our previous studies as well as in table s1 shams et al 2020 plastics which eventually ends up in aquatic environment might not remain in their pristine condition as they could be coated with surfactants hence the selected nanoscale plastics used in this study are chosen considering these surface modifications in natural aquatic environment 2 2 aquatic chemistry sodium chloride nacl calcium chloride cacl2 2h2o and magnesium chloride mgcl2 6h2o were used at different ionic strength of salt solutions nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 were used as background electrolyte solutions as they are ubiquitous in natural aquatic environments to keep it comparable with the freshwater environment concentrations and previous nanoscale plastics concentration for aggregation 10 80 150 mm nacl 0 1 0 5 1 mm cacl2 and 0 5 1 5 mm mgcl2 were used for the experiments suwannee river humic acid standard iii was used to prepare the 5 mg l 1 toc nom suspension 2 3 qcm d study quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation shift qcm d q sense e4 biolin scientific inc and a silica coated crystal sensor qsx 303 q sense were used to investigate the deposition and release of plastics on different surfaces by observing the frequency and dissipation shift changes in qcm d negative and positive frequency shifts mean deposition and release respectively here frequency and dissipation shifts were observed at the 3rd overtone initially the sensor surface was rinsed with deionized milliq mq water for at least 50 min to achieve a stable baseline 2 4 coating of sensors for plastics deposition on nom coated surface previous protocols were followed figure s1 and s2 chen and elimelech 2008 chowdhury et al 2014b while there is significant knowledge gap of the precise micro and nanoplastics concentration in the environment the selected concentration of 20 mgl 1 has been used to get significant signals in frequency and dissipation shifts in qcm d results were also normalized with favorable conditions at the same concentrations to calculate attachment efficiencies which minimized concentration effects following previous literature chen k l and elimelech m 2008 in brief the experiments were started by flowing deionized water until the normalized frequency value remained 0 3 hz for 10 min to rinse the sensors and achieve a stable baseline stage a chen and elimelech 2008 following hepes buffer in 100 mm nacl solution was flowed for 20 min to equilibrate the system stage b then poly l lysine pll in hepes buffer solution was flowed for 20 min stage c pll was used to create a favorable condition for deposition and release study as both silica and nom are negatively charged pll which is positively charged was used to deposit the negatively charged nom and nanoscale plastics chowdhury et al 2014b alam et al 2018 to remove the unadsorbed pll layer the sensor was rinsed with hepes buffer for 20 min stage d finally to remove the buffer 100 mm nacl solution was flowed for 30 min stage e after stage e 1 mm nacl for 20 min stage f was flowed and then 5 mg l nom in 1 mm nacl was flowed stage g until the stabilization of frequency shift after the pll layer was covered by nom the formed layer of nom was rinsed with 1 mm nacl stage h to remove unadsorbed nom finally the desired electrolyte was flown on the coated sensor until the frequency shift stabilized stage i on this pll coated surface 20 mg l 1 polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics in background electrolyte was deposited by flowing for at least 60 min stage j this was followed by again flowing a background electrolyte solution until again stabilized stage k and then finally deionized water was flown for release study stage l the flow rate was 0 1 ml min which was maintained for all experiments and at all stages for plastics deposition on silica surface stage a was followed by stage f g h and i only figure s3 s4 for favorable conditions silica sensors were coated with pll followed by plastics figures s5 and s6 chowdhury et al 2014a alam et al 2018 stage a to stage e were performed as mentioned in the previous section after stage e background electrolyte solution stage f was flowed until stabilization was achieved polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics 20 mg l 1 in background electrolyte was deposited on the pll coated surface by flowing for at least 60 min stage g this was followed by again flowing a background electrolyte solution until again stabilized stage h and then finally deionized water was flown for release study stage i 3 results and discussion 3 1 interactions of nanoscale plastics with silica surface 3 1 1 influence of ionic strength on deposition figures s3a and s3d show the frequency shift δf3 and dissipation shift δd3 of polyethylene and figures s4a and s4d show frequency shift δf3 and dissipation shift δd3 of polystyrene nanoscale plastics respectively on silica surface as a function of nacl concentration for polyethylene frequency shift is 2 hz regardless of nacl concentration figure s3a this suggests that polyethylene nanoscale plastics showed negligible deposition on the silica surface in the presence of nacl due to electrostatic repulsion between polyethylene nanoscale plastics and bare silica surface deposition is unfavorable at low is as ionic strength is increased 80 mm double layer compression of the polyethylene nanoscale plastics and silica surfaces increased lowering energy barrier in figure s8 which should result in higher deposition of the material on the surface however deposition studies show no deposition on the silica surface figure s3a at 80 mm nacl in qcm d a possible reason for this could be the electrostatic repulsion between nanoscale plastics and silica surfaces and the repulsive hydration force that exists due to the hydrophilic nature of silica valle delgado et al 2005 this insignificant deposition of polyethylene nanoscale plastics on bare silica surface at high ionic strength indicates that polyethylene nanoscale plastics will be highly mobile through silica media including natural sand on the other hand δf3 figure s4a and hence deposition rate rf fig 1 a on silica surface increases with increasing nacl concentration for polystyrene nanospheres as the is increased from 10 mm to 150 mm the electrical double layer compressed resulting in higher deposition of the material on the surface fig 1a table 1 figure s9 unlike polyethylene polystyrene was able to overcome the electrostatic repulsion and the repulsive hydration force between plastic and silica surface due to the surface functionalization of polystyrene attachment efficiency values calculated with the help of favorable deposition in section 5 in si were higher for increased nacl concentration table s3 on the silica surface which follows dlvo theory verwey and overbeek 1948 overbeek 1999a these values imply that the critical deposition concentration cdc of polystyrene nanospheres on the silica surface is higher than 150 mm nacl similar to the values observed in a previous study above 100 mm cai et al 2018 3 1 2 influence of valence on deposition cacl2 and mgcl2 were used to further investigate the deposition of nanoscale plastics on silica surfaces figures s3b s3c shows the δf3 and figure s3e s3f shows δd3 of polyethylene nanoscale plastics on bare silica surface as a function of cacl2 and mgcl2 concentration respectively like nacl frequency shift is 2 hz regardless of cacl2 and mgcl2 concentration figure s3b and s3c this indicates that polyethylene nanoscale plastics will not deposit on the silica surface with increasing ionic strength of cacl2 and mgcl2 as well again due to insufficient deposition during the unfavorable condition the attachment efficiency is zero overall the results suggest that polyethylene nanoscale plastics will be highly mobile through silica media including natural sand even in the presence of divalent ions figures s4b s4c shows the δf3 and figure s4e s4f shows δd3 of polystyrene nanospheres on bare silica surface as a function of cacl2 and mgcl2 concentration respectively for both salts δf3 values increase with is which indicates rf of polystyrene nanospheres increases with is fig 1a which could be due to the compressed electrical double layer edl and surface functionalization of polystyrene decreased edl layer in the presence of divalent cations enables polystyrene plastics surface functional groups to encounter the silica surface hence more deposition unlike polyethylene table 1 however the overall deposition rates for cacl2 and mgcl2 were lower compared to nacl which could be attributed to the bridging ability of ca2 and mg2 ions with polystyrene nanospheres pham et al 2009 gutierrez et al 2010 this causes slow diffusive transport of the long chained bridged polystyrene particles to silica surface and reduces the opportunity of polystyrene nanospheres deposition to the silica surface pham et al 2009 gutierrez et al 2010 attachment efficiency values of cacl2 and mgcl2 table s3 also imply that the cdc of polystyrene nanospheres on the silica surface is higher than 5 mm cacl2 and 5 mm mgcl2 cai et al 2018 3 1 3 dlvo interpretation of nanoscale plastics deposition sphere plate dlvo interaction energy profiles were developed for a better understanding of the interaction between nanoscale plastics and the silica surface and the mechanisms that control these interactions deraguin and landau 1941 verwey and overbeek 1948 dlvo profiles for both nanoscale plastics with silica system in the presence of a monovalent salt nacl are presented in figure s8 and s9 respectively this dlvo interaction energy profiles suggest that at low ionic strength 10 mm nacl repulsive energy barrier will be present s8a s9a and prevent the deposition of both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics on the silica surface consistent with the qcm d measurements when ionic strength is increased the repulsive energy barrier height decreases however a significant amount of energy barrier exists regardless of ionic strength for polyethylene figure s8a for this reason polyethylene deposition is unfavorable on bare silica surface even at a high ionic strength of nacl on the other hand for polystyrene the energy barrier is reduced with the increase in ionic strength figure s9a increasing the deposition of polystyrene moreover the plot of secondary energy minimum figure s9b shows that the depth of secondary minima increases with ionic strength which can also cause deposition wang et al 2012 3 1 4 release study of nanoscale plastics from silica surface to mimic the release of deposited materials due to changes occurring in the natural environment i e rainfall solution chemistry was changed and release of deposited materials from bare silica surfaces was observed in background electrolyte and di water for polyethylene as no deposition was observed 2 hz frequency shift on bare silica surfaces at different ionic strengths of nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 figure s3 no release data is available for the unfavorable condition on the other hand release of the deposited polystyrene was observed from the bare silica surface with increasing is of nacl but not for cacl2 and mgcl2 fig 1b electrical double layer compression in the presence of nacl could have induced higher deposition of polystyrene nanospheres but the attraction is not strong enough to prevent their release overbeek 1999b this release will increase the mobility of nanoscale plastic in the environment in the presence of nacl on the contrary the bridging effect of ca2 and mg2 with polystyrene nanoscale plastics can withstand the release of deposited material layers and hence no release of polystyrene was observed table 1 the overall release trends of polystyrene nanospheres in different salts were nacl mgcl2 cacl2 3 2 interaction of nanoscale plastics with nom coated surfaces 3 2 1 influence of ionic strength on deposition at environmentally relevant conditions nom and nom coated silica surfaces are negatively charged buffle et al 1998 therefore the deposition of polyethylene nanoscale plastics on nom coated silica surface will be unfavorable due to electrostatic repulsion yuan et al 2008 figures s1a and s2a show the frequency profiles of the deposition of polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastic on nom coated surface in the presence of nacl respectively calculated from the frequency profiles rf of both nanoscale plastics increased with increasing is due to reduced electrostatic repulsion with increasing is which follows the dlvo theory fig 2 a and 3 a overbeek 1999a in the presence of nacl the energy barrier between nom and the nanoscale plastics is reduced allowing the functional groups of nom to attach to the material surfaces leenheer 2007 hartono et al 2009 overall higher deposition of both nanoscale plastics on nom coated surface was observed than bare silica surface table 2 indicating that mobility of nanoscale plastics will be governed by their interactions with nom as nom is ubiquitous in natural environment moreover polystyrene will be deposited more than polyethylene due to the surface functionalization carboxyl group of polystyrene and lower energy barrier figure s9a thus mobility of nanoscale plastics will depend on the particle surface functionalization as well 3 2 2 influence of valence on deposition deposition of nanoscale plastics on nom coated surface was investigated as a function of cacl2 and mgcl2 as well figure s1b s1c s2b s2c again the rf values fig 2c 2e 3b 3c and total deposited mass table 2 is higher compared to bare silica surface for both nanoscale plastics as nanoscale plastics deposition on silica surface was found negligible the deposition of both nanoscale plastics increased with increasing is of cacl2 and mgcl2 table 2 this is due to charge screening which follows the dlvo theory overbeek 1999a and a complex formation of nom with divalent ions which can reduce electrostatic and steric effects chowdhury et al 2014b 3 2 3 influence of ionic strength on release deposited polyethylene nanoscale plastics were released from nom coated surface upon the introduction of di water figure s1 stage l which is summarized in table 2 table 2 shows that fractional release of polyethylene nanoscale plastics decreased with increase in ionic strength from 10 to 80 mm nacl around 61 to 14 this is due to the reduction of repulsive force between nom and polyethylene nanoscale plastics with increasing ionic strength elimelech et al 1997 on the other hand release of polystyrene nanospheres from the nom coated surface is negligible figure s2 stage l indicating that deposition of polystyrene particles on nom coated surface is irreversible elimelech et al 2013 negligible release of deposited material indicates that even though polystyrene particles will have high mobility at higher ionic strength 150 mm nacl once the material gets deposited it will not be remobilized in the environment at the presence of nacl 3 2 4 influence of valence on release deposited polyethylene nanoscale plastics showed much lower release from nom coated surface 38 23 for cacl2 and 54 37 for mgcl2 upon flow of di water compared to nacl table 2 increased cacl2 and mgcl2 concentrations reduced the release of polyethylene nanoscale plastics from nom coated surface due to bridging effect fig 2d 2f release of polystyrene nanospheres figure s2 from nom coated surface is negligible for both cacl2 and mgcl2 again indicating that deposited polystyrene nanospheres will not be remobilized in the environment in the presence of both cacl2 and mgcl2 3 3 mechanisms both polyethylene nanoscale plastics and polystyrene nanospheres showed significantly higher deposition on nom coated surfaces compared to bare silica surface the extended conformations of nom create a rough nom surface which can trap plastics in the nom layer chowdhury et al 2014b guo et al 2018 furthermore in the presence of divalent and monovalent ions the energy barrier between negatively charged nom and nanoscale plastics is reduced allowing the functional groups of nom cooh oh etc to attach to the nanoscale plastics hartono et al 2009 shams et al 2020 this indicates that functional groups and surface roughness might be controlling the deposition moreover van der waals force can also influence the deposition zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2020 from figure s8b and s9b it is seen that the secondary energy minimum falls at a separation distance of less than 30 nm this secondary energy minimum is a lower energy barrier which the particles can overcome easily this means that there is no repulsion between both plastics and material surfaces at a distance less than 30 nm in this region van der waals forces dominate alam et al 2018 so the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged nom and negatively charged nanoscale plastics is overcome due to secondary minimum and at that moment van der waals forces dominate which causes the plastic deposition on the surface guo et al 2012 alam et al 2018 4 conclusions the deposition results of both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics on a silica surface for all salt types indicates that plastics will be very mobile through sand in the environment at 10 mm nacl and 1 mm cacl2 which is the typical concentration of monovalent and divalent ions found in natural environment crittenden and montgomery watson 2005 all the results also suggest that transport and deposition of nanoscale plastics will be primarily governed by divalent ions and nom furthermore the results also indicate that both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics have higher interactions with nom coated surfaces than silica surfaces for polyethylene nanoscale plastics these depositions are reversible with the introduction of water which indicates release and remobilization of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in the environment from these surfaces on the contrary deposition of polystyrene nanospheres on nom coated surfaces are irreversible with the introduction of water which indicates lack of remobilization of polystyrene nanoscale plastics in the environment from these surfaces future research is needed on the influence of surface functionalization in the fate and transport of micro and nanoscale plastics in aquatic environment overall results indicate that higher interactions of nanoscale plastics with nom

surfaces using a quartz crystal microbalance mehnaz shams iftaykhairul alam indranil chowdhury department of civil environmental engineering washington state university pullman wa 99164 usa department of civil environmental engineering washington state university pullman wa 99164 usa department of civil environmental engineering washington state university pullman wa 99164 usa corresponding author interactions of nanoscale plastics with natural organic matter nom and silica surfaces were investigated using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring qcm d polyethylene and polystyrene are the most used plastic polymers and most likely to accumulate in the environment and thus their nano scale interactions were investigated in this study deposition and release of polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics were investigated on silica and nom coated surfaces in the presence of different salt types nacl cacl2 mgcl2 and ionic strengths is polyethylene nanoscale plastics showed negligible deposition on silica surface while significant deposition of polystyrene nanoscale plastics was observed on silica surface however both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics showed significant deposition on nom coated surfaces with polystyrene showing higher deposition increased is resulted in greater deposition of both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics on nom coated surfaces due to the functional groups following dlvo theory deposited polyethylene nanoscale plastics on nom coated surfaces can be remobilized whereas deposition of polystyrene nanoscale plastics was irreversible on both silica and nom coated surfaces overall higher deposition of nanoscale plastics on nom coated surfaces indicates that fate and mobility of nanoscale plastics in the environment will be significantly governed by their interactions with nom graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoplastics polyethylene polystyrene natural organic matter qcm d interactions 1 introduction plastic possesses some outstanding properties such as resistance to water high tensile and flexural strengths and low manufacturing and optimization cost scott 1999 however if they are not recycled then these useful features would result in their accumulation in the environment this plastic accumulation is becoming a serious problem all over the world plastics dumped into the environment after usage or from wwtp or drains goes into the rivers and lakes and eventually ends up in oceans through rainfall or wind scott 1999 browne et al 2011 polyethylene a polymer made of long chains of ethylene monomers is one of the most commonly detected plastic in the environment wright et al 2013 gewert et al 2015 it is generally used in grocery bags milk cartons food packaging straws among others due to being strong lightweight and durable thompson et al 2009 andrady 2011 polystyrene plastic is also one of the most commonly used aromatic recalcitrant polymer made from a liquid hydrocarbon monomer styrene that is commercially produced from petroleum scheirs and priddy 2003 ojeda 2013 this plastic is used in the manufacturing process of different items for example plastic laboratory consumables disposable drinking cups and packaging material gausepohl and nießner 2001 it is a highly used and detected plastic in the environment because it is comparatively cheaper than many other plastics and is disposed of after only a single use as they cannot resist heat above 100 c da costa et al 2016 after the usage and disposal into the environment these recalcitrant plastics accumulate and degrade to micro 0 1 5 mm and nanoplastics 100 nm via processes such as chemical mechanical biological processes wright et al 2013 jahnke et al 2017 due to their high surface area these nanoscale plastics can sorb organic pollutants like organochlorine pesticides polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes dioxins and metal besseling et al 2012 rochman et al 2013 this could be toxic to the aquatic organisms and other wildlife that ingests micro or nanoscale plastics moreover despite the high removal of microplastics in some treatment plants talvitie et al 2017 lares et al 2018 bayo et al 2020 large amounts of microplastics still get release into the river due to the high volume of effluent produced as well as the huge loading of plastics that enters the treatment plant alavian et al alavian petroody et al 2020 stated that the high discharge rate of treated effluent 22 000 m3 d results in a total emission of more than 9 3 million microplastics d to the environment similarly another study showed that around 8 trillion microplastics enter the aquatic environment through wwtps rochman et al 2015 some of which can also end up in drinking water tap kosuth et al 2017 cox et al 2019 even though currently the effects of micro or nanoscale plastics on human health remains unknown micro or nanoscale plastics like nanomaterials can penetrate cell barrier and cause cytotoxicity and other metabolic disorder syberg et al 2015 overall plastic pollution and accumulation is a growing concern for human health as well as for environment which necessitates the study of fate and transport of microplastics in the natural aquatic environment previous studies have shown that solution chemistries and presence of nom can influence the fate and transport of different engineered nanomaterials presence of nom can cause nanomaterial stabilization and even lead to the resuspension or redispersion of formed nanomaterial aggregates chowdhury et al 2013 lanphere et al 2014 previous studies have suggested that due to their size and colloidal particulate nature parallels can be drawn between fate research of engineered nanomaterials and microplastics hüffer et al 2017 this observation was assessed in different studies by showing that presence of nom can stabilize micro and nanoscale plastics like engineered nanomaterials cai et al 2018 shams et al 2020 this stabilization was mainly attributed to the steric repulsion caused by nom this can lead to the reduced aggregation reduced deposition and extensive transport of nanoplastics alimi et al 2018 due to the ubiquitous nature of nom sediments and other surfaces i e sand in the natural system could be coated with nom and it could be hypothesized that this could facilitate the attachment of negatively charged nanoscale plastics to these surface and govern their fate and transport behavior philippe and schaumann 2014 ateia et al 2020 so in a potential micro or nanoscale plastics release in the aquatic environment silica or nom coated surfaces can be one of the important factors controlling their fate in the environment however the inherent physical and chemical characteristics of plastics differ from other nanoparticles such as adsorption formation of eco corona biofilm which would affect the interactions of plastics in aquatic environment yet there has been no study on interactions of micro or nanoscale plastics with nom and silica surfaces moreover the release and remobilization of micro or nanoscale plastics deposited on different surfaces can impact the fate of this emerging contaminants in the environment in this study fundamental mechanisms governing interactions deposition and release of polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics with model surfaces common to the environment silica i e sand surface nom coated surfaces were investigated under various salt types nacl cacl2 mgcl2 and ionic strength using qcm d the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring qcm d has been used to characterize nanomaterial deposition onto different model surfaces chen and elimelech 2008 chowdhury et al 2014a qcm d is a sensitive method to measure mass deposition it employs a piezoelectric quartz crystal that oscillates laterally and its resonant frequency and odd overtones change to attached mass moreover qcm d can indicate the rigidity or softness of the deposited material layer to the silica surface by taking the ratio of frequency and dissipation previously researchers have observed the deposition of other nanomaterials on a collector surface in both column experiments and qcm d chowdhury et al 2014a however to the best of our knowledge interactions of nanoscale plastics with qcm d is still unexplored which will help understanding the interactions of these plastics more accurately and predicting their fate and mobility in the environment polyethylene and polystyrene were chosen as model plastics as they are the most widely produced and commonly found plastics lu et al 2009 rao and geckeler 2011 these laboratory experiments can help elucidating the fate and mobility of these nanoscale plastics in the natural environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 nanoscale plastics preparation the stock solution of polyethylene nanoscale plastic was prepared by mixing polyethylene nanospheres 200nm 9900 nm diameter 0 95 g cc density from cospheric llc ca usa beiras et al 2018 with deionized water and 0 1 wt sodium dodecyl sulfate sds strano et al 2003 péron et al 2007 the stock solution of polystyrene latex particles surface functionalized with carboxyl groups was prepared by diluting the original suspension purchased from thermo fisher scientific 4 w v with diameter of 20 nm cai et al 2018 shams et al 2020 both the solutions were prepared in the concentration of 40 mg l 1 and their characterization results are provided in our previous studies as well as in table s1 shams et al 2020 plastics which eventually ends up in aquatic environment might not remain in their pristine condition as they could be coated with surfactants hence the selected nanoscale plastics used in this study are chosen considering these surface modifications in natural aquatic environment 2 2 aquatic chemistry sodium chloride nacl calcium chloride cacl2 2h2o and magnesium chloride mgcl2 6h2o were used at different ionic strength of salt solutions nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 were used as background electrolyte solutions as they are ubiquitous in natural aquatic environments to keep it comparable with the freshwater environment concentrations and previous nanoscale plastics concentration for aggregation 10 80 150 mm nacl 0 1 0 5 1 mm cacl2 and 0 5 1 5 mm mgcl2 were used for the experiments suwannee river humic acid standard iii was used to prepare the 5 mg l 1 toc nom suspension 2 3 qcm d study quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation shift qcm d q sense e4 biolin scientific inc and a silica coated crystal sensor qsx 303 q sense were used to investigate the deposition and release of plastics on different surfaces by observing the frequency and dissipation shift changes in qcm d negative and positive frequency shifts mean deposition and release respectively here frequency and dissipation shifts were observed at the 3rd overtone initially the sensor surface was rinsed with deionized milliq mq water for at least 50 min to achieve a stable baseline 2 4 coating of sensors for plastics deposition on nom coated surface previous protocols were followed figure s1 and s2 chen and elimelech 2008 chowdhury et al 2014b while there is significant knowledge gap of the precise micro and nanoplastics concentration in the environment the selected concentration of 20 mgl 1 has been used to get significant signals in frequency and dissipation shifts in qcm d results were also normalized with favorable conditions at the same concentrations to calculate attachment efficiencies which minimized concentration effects following previous literature chen k l and elimelech m 2008 in brief the experiments were started by flowing deionized water until the normalized frequency value remained 0 3 hz for 10 min to rinse the sensors and achieve a stable baseline stage a chen and elimelech 2008 following hepes buffer in 100 mm nacl solution was flowed for 20 min to equilibrate the system stage b then poly l lysine pll in hepes buffer solution was flowed for 20 min stage c pll was used to create a favorable condition for deposition and release study as both silica and nom are negatively charged pll which is positively charged was used to deposit the negatively charged nom and nanoscale plastics chowdhury et al 2014b alam et al 2018 to remove the unadsorbed pll layer the sensor was rinsed with hepes buffer for 20 min stage d finally to remove the buffer 100 mm nacl solution was flowed for 30 min stage e after stage e 1 mm nacl for 20 min stage f was flowed and then 5 mg l nom in 1 mm nacl was flowed stage g until the stabilization of frequency shift after the pll layer was covered by nom the formed layer of nom was rinsed with 1 mm nacl stage h to remove unadsorbed nom finally the desired electrolyte was flown on the coated sensor until the frequency shift stabilized stage i on this pll coated surface 20 mg l 1 polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics in background electrolyte was deposited by flowing for at least 60 min stage j this was followed by again flowing a background electrolyte solution until again stabilized stage k and then finally deionized water was flown for release study stage l the flow rate was 0 1 ml min which was maintained for all experiments and at all stages for plastics deposition on silica surface stage a was followed by stage f g h and i only figure s3 s4 for favorable conditions silica sensors were coated with pll followed by plastics figures s5 and s6 chowdhury et al 2014a alam et al 2018 stage a to stage e were performed as mentioned in the previous section after stage e background electrolyte solution stage f was flowed until stabilization was achieved polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics 20 mg l 1 in background electrolyte was deposited on the pll coated surface by flowing for at least 60 min stage g this was followed by again flowing a background electrolyte solution until again stabilized stage h and then finally deionized water was flown for release study stage i 3 results and discussion 3 1 interactions of nanoscale plastics with silica surface 3 1 1 influence of ionic strength on deposition figures s3a and s3d show the frequency shift δf3 and dissipation shift δd3 of polyethylene and figures s4a and s4d show frequency shift δf3 and dissipation shift δd3 of polystyrene nanoscale plastics respectively on silica surface as a function of nacl concentration for polyethylene frequency shift is 2 hz regardless of nacl concentration figure s3a this suggests that polyethylene nanoscale plastics showed negligible deposition on the silica surface in the presence of nacl due to electrostatic repulsion between polyethylene nanoscale plastics and bare silica surface deposition is unfavorable at low is as ionic strength is increased 80 mm double layer compression of the polyethylene nanoscale plastics and silica surfaces increased lowering energy barrier in figure s8 which should result in higher deposition of the material on the surface however deposition studies show no deposition on the silica surface figure s3a at 80 mm nacl in qcm d a possible reason for this could be the electrostatic repulsion between nanoscale plastics and silica surfaces and the repulsive hydration force that exists due to the hydrophilic nature of silica valle delgado et al 2005 this insignificant deposition of polyethylene nanoscale plastics on bare silica surface at high ionic strength indicates that polyethylene nanoscale plastics will be highly mobile through silica media including natural sand on the other hand δf3 figure s4a and hence deposition rate rf fig 1 a on silica surface increases with increasing nacl concentration for polystyrene nanospheres as the is increased from 10 mm to 150 mm the electrical double layer compressed resulting in higher deposition of the material on the surface fig 1a table 1 figure s9 unlike polyethylene polystyrene was able to overcome the electrostatic repulsion and the repulsive hydration force between plastic and silica surface due to the surface functionalization of polystyrene attachment efficiency values calculated with the help of favorable deposition in section 5 in si were higher for increased nacl concentration table s3 on the silica surface which follows dlvo theory verwey and overbeek 1948 overbeek 1999a these values imply that the critical deposition concentration cdc of polystyrene nanospheres on the silica surface is higher than 150 mm nacl similar to the values observed in a previous study above 100 mm cai et al 2018 3 1 2 influence of valence on deposition cacl2 and mgcl2 were used to further investigate the deposition of nanoscale plastics on silica surfaces figures s3b s3c shows the δf3 and figure s3e s3f shows δd3 of polyethylene nanoscale plastics on bare silica surface as a function of cacl2 and mgcl2 concentration respectively like nacl frequency shift is 2 hz regardless of cacl2 and mgcl2 concentration figure s3b and s3c this indicates that polyethylene nanoscale plastics will not deposit on the silica surface with increasing ionic strength of cacl2 and mgcl2 as well again due to insufficient deposition during the unfavorable condition the attachment efficiency is zero overall the results suggest that polyethylene nanoscale plastics will be highly mobile through silica media including natural sand even in the presence of divalent ions figures s4b s4c shows the δf3 and figure s4e s4f shows δd3 of polystyrene nanospheres on bare silica surface as a function of cacl2 and mgcl2 concentration respectively for both salts δf3 values increase with is which indicates rf of polystyrene nanospheres increases with is fig 1a which could be due to the compressed electrical double layer edl and surface functionalization of polystyrene decreased edl layer in the presence of divalent cations enables polystyrene plastics surface functional groups to encounter the silica surface hence more deposition unlike polyethylene table 1 however the overall deposition rates for cacl2 and mgcl2 were lower compared to nacl which could be attributed to the bridging ability of ca2 and mg2 ions with polystyrene nanospheres pham et al 2009 gutierrez et al 2010 this causes slow diffusive transport of the long chained bridged polystyrene particles to silica surface and reduces the opportunity of polystyrene nanospheres deposition to the silica surface pham et al 2009 gutierrez et al 2010 attachment efficiency values of cacl2 and mgcl2 table s3 also imply that the cdc of polystyrene nanospheres on the silica surface is higher than 5 mm cacl2 and 5 mm mgcl2 cai et al 2018 3 1 3 dlvo interpretation of nanoscale plastics deposition sphere plate dlvo interaction energy profiles were developed for a better understanding of the interaction between nanoscale plastics and the silica surface and the mechanisms that control these interactions deraguin and landau 1941 verwey and overbeek 1948 dlvo profiles for both nanoscale plastics with silica system in the presence of a monovalent salt nacl are presented in figure s8 and s9 respectively this dlvo interaction energy profiles suggest that at low ionic strength 10 mm nacl repulsive energy barrier will be present s8a s9a and prevent the deposition of both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics on the silica surface consistent with the qcm d measurements when ionic strength is increased the repulsive energy barrier height decreases however a significant amount of energy barrier exists regardless of ionic strength for polyethylene figure s8a for this reason polyethylene deposition is unfavorable on bare silica surface even at a high ionic strength of nacl on the other hand for polystyrene the energy barrier is reduced with the increase in ionic strength figure s9a increasing the deposition of polystyrene moreover the plot of secondary energy minimum figure s9b shows that the depth of secondary minima increases with ionic strength which can also cause deposition wang et al 2012 3 1 4 release study of nanoscale plastics from silica surface to mimic the release of deposited materials due to changes occurring in the natural environment i e rainfall solution chemistry was changed and release of deposited materials from bare silica surfaces was observed in background electrolyte and di water for polyethylene as no deposition was observed 2 hz frequency shift on bare silica surfaces at different ionic strengths of nacl cacl2 and mgcl2 figure s3 no release data is available for the unfavorable condition on the other hand release of the deposited polystyrene was observed from the bare silica surface with increasing is of nacl but not for cacl2 and mgcl2 fig 1b electrical double layer compression in the presence of nacl could have induced higher deposition of polystyrene nanospheres but the attraction is not strong enough to prevent their release overbeek 1999b this release will increase the mobility of nanoscale plastic in the environment in the presence of nacl on the contrary the bridging effect of ca2 and mg2 with polystyrene nanoscale plastics can withstand the release of deposited material layers and hence no release of polystyrene was observed table 1 the overall release trends of polystyrene nanospheres in different salts were nacl mgcl2 cacl2 3 2 interaction of nanoscale plastics with nom coated surfaces 3 2 1 influence of ionic strength on deposition at environmentally relevant conditions nom and nom coated silica surfaces are negatively charged buffle et al 1998 therefore the deposition of polyethylene nanoscale plastics on nom coated silica surface will be unfavorable due to electrostatic repulsion yuan et al 2008 figures s1a and s2a show the frequency profiles of the deposition of polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastic on nom coated surface in the presence of nacl respectively calculated from the frequency profiles rf of both nanoscale plastics increased with increasing is due to reduced electrostatic repulsion with increasing is which follows the dlvo theory fig 2 a and 3 a overbeek 1999a in the presence of nacl the energy barrier between nom and the nanoscale plastics is reduced allowing the functional groups of nom to attach to the material surfaces leenheer 2007 hartono et al 2009 overall higher deposition of both nanoscale plastics on nom coated surface was observed than bare silica surface table 2 indicating that mobility of nanoscale plastics will be governed by their interactions with nom as nom is ubiquitous in natural environment moreover polystyrene will be deposited more than polyethylene due to the surface functionalization carboxyl group of polystyrene and lower energy barrier figure s9a thus mobility of nanoscale plastics will depend on the particle surface functionalization as well 3 2 2 influence of valence on deposition deposition of nanoscale plastics on nom coated surface was investigated as a function of cacl2 and mgcl2 as well figure s1b s1c s2b s2c again the rf values fig 2c 2e 3b 3c and total deposited mass table 2 is higher compared to bare silica surface for both nanoscale plastics as nanoscale plastics deposition on silica surface was found negligible the deposition of both nanoscale plastics increased with increasing is of cacl2 and mgcl2 table 2 this is due to charge screening which follows the dlvo theory overbeek 1999a and a complex formation of nom with divalent ions which can reduce electrostatic and steric effects chowdhury et al 2014b 3 2 3 influence of ionic strength on release deposited polyethylene nanoscale plastics were released from nom coated surface upon the introduction of di water figure s1 stage l which is summarized in table 2 table 2 shows that fractional release of polyethylene nanoscale plastics decreased with increase in ionic strength from 10 to 80 mm nacl around 61 to 14 this is due to the reduction of repulsive force between nom and polyethylene nanoscale plastics with increasing ionic strength elimelech et al 1997 on the other hand release of polystyrene nanospheres from the nom coated surface is negligible figure s2 stage l indicating that deposition of polystyrene particles on nom coated surface is irreversible elimelech et al 2013 negligible release of deposited material indicates that even though polystyrene particles will have high mobility at higher ionic strength 150 mm nacl once the material gets deposited it will not be remobilized in the environment at the presence of nacl 3 2 4 influence of valence on release deposited polyethylene nanoscale plastics showed much lower release from nom coated surface 38 23 for cacl2 and 54 37 for mgcl2 upon flow of di water compared to nacl table 2 increased cacl2 and mgcl2 concentrations reduced the release of polyethylene nanoscale plastics from nom coated surface due to bridging effect fig 2d 2f release of polystyrene nanospheres figure s2 from nom coated surface is negligible for both cacl2 and mgcl2 again indicating that deposited polystyrene nanospheres will not be remobilized in the environment in the presence of both cacl2 and mgcl2 3 3 mechanisms both polyethylene nanoscale plastics and polystyrene nanospheres showed significantly higher deposition on nom coated surfaces compared to bare silica surface the extended conformations of nom create a rough nom surface which can trap plastics in the nom layer chowdhury et al 2014b guo et al 2018 furthermore in the presence of divalent and monovalent ions the energy barrier between negatively charged nom and nanoscale plastics is reduced allowing the functional groups of nom cooh oh etc to attach to the nanoscale plastics hartono et al 2009 shams et al 2020 this indicates that functional groups and surface roughness might be controlling the deposition moreover van der waals force can also influence the deposition zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2020 from figure s8b and s9b it is seen that the secondary energy minimum falls at a separation distance of less than 30 nm this secondary energy minimum is a lower energy barrier which the particles can overcome easily this means that there is no repulsion between both plastics and material surfaces at a distance less than 30 nm in this region van der waals forces dominate alam et al 2018 so the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged nom and negatively charged nanoscale plastics is overcome due to secondary minimum and at that moment van der waals forces dominate which causes the plastic deposition on the surface guo et al 2012 alam et al 2018 4 conclusions the deposition results of both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics on a silica surface for all salt types indicates that plastics will be very mobile through sand in the environment at 10 mm nacl and 1 mm cacl2 which is the typical concentration of monovalent and divalent ions found in natural environment crittenden and montgomery watson 2005 all the results also suggest that transport and deposition of nanoscale plastics will be primarily governed by divalent ions and nom furthermore the results also indicate that both polyethylene and polystyrene nanoscale plastics have higher interactions with nom coated surfaces than silica surfaces for polyethylene nanoscale plastics these depositions are reversible with the introduction of water which indicates release and remobilization of polyethylene nanoscale plastics in the environment from these surfaces on the contrary deposition of polystyrene nanospheres on nom coated surfaces are irreversible with the introduction of water which indicates lack of remobilization of polystyrene nanoscale plastics in the environment from these surfaces future research is needed on the influence of surface functionalization in the fate and transport of micro and nanoscale plastics in aquatic environment overall results indicate that higher interactions of nanoscale plastics with nom will govern their fate in aquatic environment supporting information additional information on experimental details on qcm d dlvo profiles and additional figures are provided in supporting information

17019,bromide br is a typical scavenger to sulfate radical so4 and hydroxyl radical ho which simultaneously forms secondary reactive bromine species rbs such as br and br2 this study investigated the effects of br at fresh water levels μm on the radical chemistry in the uv peroxydisulfate uv pds process by combining the degradation kinetics of probe compounds nitrobenzene metronidazole and benzoate with kinetic model br at 1 50 μm promoted the conversion from so4 to ho and rbs in the uv pds process at ph 7 the concentration of so4 monotonically decreased by 31 5 94 8 at 1 50 μm br while that of ho showed an increasing and then decreasing pattern with a maximum increase by 171 7 at 5 μm br the concentrations of br and br2 10 12 10 10 m were 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than so4 and ho alkaline condition promoted the conversion from so4 to ho and drove the transformation from rbs to ho resulting in much lower concentrations of rbs at ph 10 br at 1 μm and 5 μm decreased the pseudo first order reaction rates kʹs of 15 pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps by 15 2 73 9 but increased kʹs of naproxen and ibuprofen by 13 7 57 3 at ph 7 the co existence of 10 1000 μm cl with 5 μm br further promoted the conversion from so4 to ho compared to br alone bicarbonate consumed so4 and ho but slightly affected rbs while natural organic matter nom exerted scavenging effects on ho and rbs more significantly than so4 this study demonstrated that br at fresh water levels significantly altered the radical chemistry of the uv pds process especially for promoting the formation of ho graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation process sulfate radicals hydroxyl radicals bromide micropollutants water treatment 1 introduction recently sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation process aops have attracted increasing attention to micropollutant degradation such as algal toxins antoniou et al 2010a antoniou et al 2010b pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 lian et al 2017 and perfluorocarboxylic acids hori et al 2005 in aquatic environment so4 can be generated by activating persulfate via ultraviolet uv heat and transition metals etc oh et al 2016 ghanbari and moradi 2017 wang and wang 2018 although the oxidation potential of so4 2 5 3 1 v is comparable to that of hydroxyl radical ho 1 8 2 7 v buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 so4 driven oxidation is much more selective and it possesses higher reactivity toward some micropollutants than ho lee et al 2020a generally so4 can react with h2o and oh to generate ho via eqs 1 2 peyton 1993 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 1 so4 h2o ho h so4 2 k 660 s 1 2 so4 oh ho so4 2 k 7 0 107 m 1 s 1 br is naturally present in fresh waters worldwide usually the concentrations of br range from undetectable to about 0 5 mg l 6 μm in fresh water who 2009 however the br concentrations are up to 2 mg l 25 μm and 4 13 mg l 52 μm in surface water of israel and australia respectively heller grossman et al 1999 magazinovic et al 2004 prior studies primarily focused on the effects of br at seawater and saline wastewater levels mm on the abatement of micropollutants in so4 based aops but obtained the inconsistent results at ph 7 the degradation of humic acid benzophenone diethyl phthalate salbutamol and terbutaline was decreased by uv pds in the presence of 0 05 10 mm br lou et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 ma et al 2020 wang et al 2020 whereas the degradation of ofloxacin sulfamethoxazole and sulfonamides was promoted in the presence of 0 1 0 8 mm br in the uv pds process at ph 7 wang and wang 2018 zhu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a the decreased degradation is ascribed to the consumption of primary radicals of so4 whereas the enhanced degradation is observed due to their high reactivities with the secondary reactive bromine species rbs such as br and br2 zhou et al 2019 by contrast br 0 2 4 mm had no effect on the degradation of tetrabromobisphenol a in the uv pds process at ph 12 since alkaline ph promoted the formation of ho and br2 and they compensated for the loss of so4 guo et al 2014 to our best knowledge effects of br at fresh water levels 10 μm on degradation kinetics of micropollutants in the uv pds process are rarely studied which need more investigation effects of br on the radical chemistry of so4 based aops have been evaluated but most of which focus on br at wastewater and seawater levels yang et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 specifically br first scavenges so4 to form br and br reacts with br to form br2 eqs 3 4 besides broh can be generated via the reactions of br with oh h2o and ho with br eqs 5 6 and 8 which further reacts with br to form br2 eq 7 or decomposing to br eq 5 and further reacting with br

the dominant radical species in the uv pds process yang et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 wang et al 2020 most studies focused on the conversion from so4 ho to rbs in so4 based aops and primarily investigated roles of rbs on micropollutant degradation with br at seawater levels however effects of br at fresh water levels 10 μm on the radical chemistry of so4 based aops are largely unknown therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the effects of br at fresh water levels on radical chemistry of the uv pds process along with the influences of different factors e g br concentrations solution ph water matrices such as chloride cl bicarbonate hco3 and natural organic matter nom both the probe compound method and modeling simulation were employed where nitrobenzene

corresponding average uv fluence rate was 0 92 mw cm 2 probing experiments were employed to investigate the radical transformation where nitrobenzene metronidazole and benzoate were used as the probe

existence of cl 10 1000 µm and br 5 µm were carried out in a similar manner but in the absence of pds or uv photolysis respectively all tests were conducted at least twice the error bars in the plots represent the maximum and minimum of the experimental data of the duplicate test results 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of nitrobenzene metronidazole and benzoate were determined by high

table s3 the rate constants were obtained from the literature when available or estimated based on analogies to similar reactions peyton 1993 grebel et al 2010 yang et al 2014 lian et al 2017 nist 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of bromide at fresh water level on the conversion of radical species fig 1 compares the effects of br at 0 50 μm on the pseudo first order reaction rates kʹs of nitrobenzene metronidazole and benzoate by the uv pds process at ph 7 and 10 at ph 7 three probe compounds were resistant to pds oxidation with or without the presence of br 0 50 μm fig s6 also the presence of br 1 50 μm had negligible effect on the uv photolysis of probe compounds the k s of nitrobenzene metronidazole and benzoate by uv photolysis were only 5 0 10 5 s 1 9 1 10 4 s 1 and 8 6 10 5 s 1 respectively fig s6 whereas those by uv pds were 9 2 10 4 s 1 2 1 10 2 s 1 and 4 6 10 3 s 1 respectively at ph 7 figs 1a 1c indicating the dominant roles of radicals for probe compound degradation as the br concentrations increased from 0 to 50 μm the k of nitrobenzene k nitrobenzene exhibited an increasing and then decreasing trend with a maximum at 5 μm that was 171 7 2 5 10 3 s 1 higher than that in the absence of br 9 2 10 4 s 1 when the br concentration reached 50 μm the promotive effect was still observed and k nitrobenzene was 19 6 1 1 10 3 s 1 higher than that in the absence of br the k of benzoate k benzoate almost remained stable with 1 10 μm br but significantly decreased by 56 3 at 50 μm br and that of metronidazole k metronidazole monotonically decreased from 1 3 10 2 s 1 to 2 0 10 3 s 1 fig 1 the trends at ph 10 were different from those at ph 7 as the br concentration increased from 0 to 50 μm k nitrobenzene and k benzoate monotonically increased by 67 8 and 55 5 respectively whereas k metronidazole decreased by 19 2 nitrobenzene has higher reactivity with ho 109 m 1 s 1 rather than so4 and rbs 106 m 1 s 1 and metronidazole has higher reactivity with both so4 and ho 109 m 1 s 1 rather than rbs 107 m 1 s 1 table 1 thus the steady state concentrations of ho ho ss and so4 so4 ss were quantified by using k nitrobenzene and k metronidazole in the uv pds process respectively eqs 9 10 9 k nitrobenzene k nitrobenzene ho ho ss k nitrobenzene uv 10 k metronidazole k metronidazole ho ho ss k metronidazole so4 so4 ss k metronidazole uv k nitrobenzene uv and k metronidazole uv here represent the direct uv photolysis rate constants of nitrobenzene and metronidazole respectively k nitrobenzene ho k metronidazole ho and k metronidazole s o 4 represent the k of ho with nitrobenzene k nitrobenzene ho 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 ho and so4 with metronidazole k metronidazole ho 3 8 0 1 109 m 1 s 1 k metronidazole s o 4 8 4 0 3 109 m 1 s 1 respectively determined in this study the k metronidazole ho was consistent with that reported by lian et al 2017 3 5 0 4 109 m 1 s 1 the k metronidazole s o 4 was around threefold of that in lian et al 2017 2 7 0 1 109 m 1 s 1 and it determined in this study should be more reliable as the experimental result fitted well the modeling result as described below based on the obtained ho ss and so4 ss table s4 the roles of different radicals on probe compound degradation can be differentiated as the br concentration increased from 0 to 50 μm so4 ss decreased from 2 4 10 12 m to 1 6 10 13 m and ho ss increased from 2 4 10 13 m to a maximum 6 2 10 13 m at 5 μm br and then decreased to 2 6 10 13 m at 50 μm br for metronidazole the contribution of so4 monotonically decreased from 95 6 to 57 4 with increasing br concentration from 0 to 50 μm while that of ho monotonically increased from 4 4 to 42 6 fig 1b besides ho and so4 k benzoate also includes the roles of rbs eq 11 since rbs such as br and br2 are reactive toward benzoate with the rate constants of 6 1 108 m 1 s 1 and 2 106 m 1 s 1 respectively lee et al 2020 11 k benzoate k benzoate ho ho ss k benzaote so4 so4 ss k benzoate rbs k benzoate uv k benzoate ho and k benzoate s o 4 represent the k of benzoate reacting with ho 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 and so4 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 respectively fang et al 2014 k benzoate rbs and k benzoate uv represent the degradation rate of benzoate by rbs and direct uv photolysis respectively at ph 7 the relative contribution of so4 to the degradation of benzoate decreased from 61 8 to 7 3 with increasing br concentration from 0 to 50 μm whereas that of ho increased from 30 2 to a maximum of 81 2 at 5 μm br but decreased to 56 4 at 50 μm br by subtracting the specific k s of uv so4 and ho from the total k benzoate k benzoate rbs increased from 10 2 to 36 3 with increasing br from 1 μm to 50 μm at ph 7 fig 1c at ph 10 so4 ss decreased from 6 6 10 13 m to 2 5 10 13 m and ho ss monotonically increased from 7 3 10 13 m to 1 2 10 12 m for metronidazole the contribution of so4 decreased from 67 4 to 30 6 whereas that of ho increased from 32 6 to 69 4 fig 1e unlike at ph 7 ho had the largest percentage contribution to the overall benzoate degradation at 0 50 μm br 82 2 91 while so4 had a minor contribution 3 2 15 4 and the roles of rbs were negligible fig 1f 3 2 simulation of the steady state radical concentrations by kinetic modeling the kinetic model was employed to simulate the steady state concentrations of radicals as shown in fig 1 and table s4 the modeling concentrations of so4 and ho well fitted the experimental results indicating that the kinetic model was reliable fig 2 compares the variations in the modeling radical concentrations as a function of the br concentration at ph 7 and ph 10 respectively at ph 7 the steady state concentrations of br br ss and br2 br2 ss increased from 9 8 10 13 m to 1 1 10 11 m and increased from 8 5 10 13 m to 9 7 10 10 m respectively as br levels increased from 1 μm to 50 μm the concentrations of br and br2 were 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than those of both so4 and ho whereas that of broh was at much lower concentration 10 15 10 14 m fig 2a by multiplying the modeling concentrations of rbs with the known bimolecular reaction rate constants the specific roles of rbs on the benzoate degradation were evaluated at ph 7 modeling roles of br responsible for benzoate degradation were 7 6 13 5 at 1 50 μm br whereas those of br2 were unimportant at 1 5 μm br and were 11 2 at 10 μm br and 35 4 at 50 μm br respectively at ph 10 the concentrations of rbs were much lower than those at ph 7 br ss and br2 ss were at 10 15 10 13 m in the presence of 1 50 μm br 1 3 orders of magnitude lower than so4 ss and ho ss thus the contributions of br and br2 for benzoate degradation were negligible overall these results indicated that the presence of br at freshwater levels promoted the conversion from so4 to ho and rbs which was distinct from br at saline wastewater or seawater levels as a sink for both so4 and ho in the uv pds process yang et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 3 3 radical chemistry of uv pds with bromide at fresh water levels 3 3 1 the radical chemistry at ph 7 the concentrations of specific radicals depend on their formation and consumption by multiplying the individual concentrations with the bimolecular reaction rate constants the k s of so4 and ho reacting with the probe compounds oxidants br h2o oh and phosphate buffer were calculated and note that reverse reactions were taken into account so4 primarily reacted with br with k s of 3 5 103 1 8 105 s 1 in the presence of 1 50 μm br at ph 7 fig s7a and the k s of so4 reacting with h2o and oh were only 6 6 102 s 1 and 7 0 s 1 respectively peyton 1993 guo et al 2020 suggesting that so4 primarily reacted with br to form br br could react with h2o slowly to form broh and then broh was further decomposed to both ho and br eqs 5 6 and 8 as for ho probe compounds had minor consumption to ho 6 8 103 s 1 while br 1 50 μm primarily quenched ho with the forward k s of 1 1 55 104 s 1 fig s7b although 1 5 μm br rapidly reacted with ho to generate broh with k s of 1 1 5 5 104 s 1 broh was decomposed to ho with k of 3 3 107 s 1 eq 8 the reversible rate is 3 orders of magnitude higher than the forward reaction rate zhang and parker 2018 suggesting the negligible scavenging effect of ho by br that is br 5 μm promoted the conversion of so4 to ho due to the rapid consumption of so4 but slow consumption of ho increasing br levels to 50 μm accelerated the consumption of ho to form broh and also promoted the conversion from broh to br2 at 50 μm br eq 7 thus br 10 50 μm decreased the concentration of ho due to the higher consumption rate of ho resulting in br and br2 being the dominate radicals at 50 μm br and ph 7 3 3 2 the radical chemistry at ph 10 fig s7 also shows the k s of so4 and ho reacting with probe compounds oxidants br h2o oh at ph 10 compared to ph 7 so4 primarily reacted with oh 7 103 s 1 in the absence of br fig s7c resulting in the considerable formation of ho which was consistent with the promotive conversion from so4 to ho at alkaline ph fang et al 2012 lutze et al 2015 the k of so4 reacting with oh at ph 10 7 103 s 1 was comparable to those with 1 10 μm br 3 5 35 103 s 1 indicating the strong competition of the former reaction to reduce the formation of br by the latter at ph 10 compared to ph 7 meanwhile alkaline condition accelerated the reactions of br br2 with oh to form broh eqs 5 and 7 and then enhanced the conversion of broh to ho but not br eq 8 thus ho increased substantially in the presence of 1 50 μm br at ph 10 while rbs were less important overall the effects of br at freshwater levels on the radical chemistry of the uv pds process are illustrated in scheme 1 so4 initially reacts with br to form br and then br primarily reacts with br to form br2 br plays a dual effect on ho at neutral condition br reacts with h2o oh to form broh and then broh is decomposed to both ho and br simultaneously br scavenges ho and finally results in the formation of br and br2 the alkaline condition promotes the conversion from so4 to ho since higher ph values increase oh formation and it also drives the reactions of br br2 with oh to generate broh and then to ho therefore ho is important at both ph 7 and 10 while rbs exerts the predominant role at ph 7 3 4 effects of water matrices on the radical chemistry in the uv pds process 3 4 1 effect of chloride we further evaluated different water matrices on the radical chemistry in the uv pds process at 5 μm br and ph 7 cl and br usually coexist in fresh water thus the effect of halide mixtures on the radical chemistry of uv pds was investigated fig 3 compared to the result at 5 μm br alone k nitrobenzene and k benzoate increased by 8 7 68 3 and 7 8 46 6 respectively in the co existence of 10 1000 μm cl and 5 μm br while k metronidazole slightly increased by 4 9 with 10 μm cl but decreased by 10 26 8 with 100 1000 μm cl in the presence of co existence of cl 10 1000 μm and br 5 μm so4 ss decreased by 16 9 31 4 compared to that in 5 μm br alone while ho ss increased by 10 74 by modeling which were fitted well with the experimental results cl can scavenge so4 to form cl then cl reacts with h2o oh to form cloh and cloh can rapidly decompose to ho lutze et al 2015 zhang and parker 2018 therefore the co presence of cl 10 1000 μm promoted the transformation from so4 to ho than that in br alone while the formation of rcs was less important 10 15 10 13 m table 2 rbs of br ss and br2 ss by modeling were slightly lower than those at 5 μm br alone table 2 as they were transformed to clbr via the reaction of cl and rbs yang et al 2014 yang et al 2016 the concentrations of clbr were 10 14 10 12 m table 2 which were 1 3 orders of magnitude lower than those of rbs a prior research reported that br2 and clbr were the dominant radicals in the coexisting 540 mm cl and 0 8 mm br at seawater levels since br acted as the most important ho scavenger yang et al 2014 unlike halides at seawater levels ho is also an important radical in the presence of halide mixtures at freshwater levels 3 4 2 effect of hco3 in the co existence of 1 mm hco3 and 5 μm br k nitrobenzene k metronidazole and k benzoate significantly decreased by 74 8 50 3 and 67 1 respectively compared to those at 5 μm br alone in the uv pds process fig 4 so4 ss and ho ss by modeling were 4 1 10 13 m and 1 6 10 13 m respectively at 1 mm hco3 and 5 μm br which were 2 and 3 times lower than at 5 μm br alone respectively table 2 br ss and br2 ss by modeling were 5 6 10 13 m and 3 5 10 11 m respectively and they slightly decreased by 37 44 compared to those at 5 μm br alone besides the steady state concentration of carbonate radical co3 was formed at 3 5 10 12 m which was an order of magnitude higher than those of so4 and ho co3 had a negligible contribution for the degradation of three probe compounds via modeling results and br 18 1 contributed to degrade benzoate besides ho 60 4 and so4 21 5 as can be seen the roles of rbs changed slightly for the benzoate abatement at 5 μm br regardless of the presence of hco3 the effect of hco3 on the radical chemistry of uv pds with br at trace levels can be explained by the fractions of so4 ho and rbs scavenged by hco3 hco3 scavenged so4 and ho with rate constants of 9 1 106 m 1 s 1 and 1 107 m 1 s 1 respectively lutze et al 2015 resulting in the consumption of so4 ho to co3 in contrast the rate constants of hco3 with br and br2 were 1 106 m 1 s 1 and 8 104 m 1 s 1 respectively zhang et al 2020b which were 1 3 orders of magnitude lower than those with so4 ho therefore hco3 primarily scavenged so4 and ho to form co3 but less scavenged rbs resulting in br br2 and co3 dominating the uv pds process 3 4 3 effect of nom fig 4 also shows that nom had significant inhibition degradation to three probe compounds k nitrobenzene k metronidazole and k benzoate decreased by 88 1 59 6 and 81 0 respectively in the presence of 1 mg l nom at 5 μm br and ph 7 compared to those at 5 μm br alone so4 ss ho ss br ss and br2 ss by modeling were 3 1 10 13 m 7 5 10 14 m 2 4 10 14 m and 9 9 10 13 m respectively in the presence of 1 mg l nom at 5 μm br in which the concentrations of ho and rbs were 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than those at 5 μm br alone and that of so4 decreased by 2 7 times table 2 although 5 μm br efficiently converted so4 to ho and rbs nom was a stronger sink for ho knom ho 2 5 104 mg l 1 s 1 and rbs knom br 2 5 104 mg l 1 s 1 than so4 2 0 103 mg l 1 s 1 hou et al 2018 guo et al 2020 which caused a more significant decrease of ho and rbs than so4 in addition nom served as an inner filter for uv light to reduce the direct photolysis efficiency of pds and further to decrease the concentrations of so4 fang et al 2014 3 5 effects of bromide at fresh water levels on the degradation kinetics of ppcps effects of br on the abatement of structurally diverse ppcps under environmentally relevant conditions by the uv pds process were further investigated fig 5 shows the effects of br at 1 μm and 5 μm on the degradation kinetics of ppcps 1 μg l by uv pds process at ph 7 in pure water the oxidation of 19 ppcps by pds oxidation or uv photolysis was negligible except for sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol by uv photolysis with the kʹs of 3 6 10 3 s 1 and 1 1 10 3 s 1 respectively in uv pds kʹs of 19 ppcps ranged from 4 2 10 3 s 1 to 3 3 10 2 s 1 so4 ss and ho ss were calculated to be 1 4 10 12 m and 3 1 10 13 m respectively based on the degradation of nitrobenzene and metronidazole respectively eqs 9 10 figs 5 and s8 which were consistent to the modeling results 1 9 10 12 m for so4 ss and 3 3 10 13 m for ho ss to facilitate discussion the 19 ppcps were grouped according to their different reactivities with so4 and ho 1 9 ppcps that were primarily degraded by so4 were defined as group i k s o 4 k ho 0 7 including ornidazole metronidazole dimetridazole ronidazole tinidazole atenolol metoprolol sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol 2 10 ppcps were degraded primarily degraded by ho were defined as group ii k s o 4 k ho 0 7 containing trimethoprim bezafibrate naproxen salbutamol primidone carbamazepine gemfibrozil flumequine nalidixic acid and ibuprofen by multiplying the radical concentrations with the bimolecular reaction rate constants the k s of so4 and ho reacting with a specific ppcp were calculated the roles of so4 were 76 7 80 9 for the degradation of group i whereas those of ho was also significant 35 4 59 7 for the degradation of group ii compared to the absence of br the presence of 1 µm br inhibited the degradation of group i with the decrease of k by 42 5 53 3 interestingly 1 µm br slightly decreased 8 ppcps in group ii with the k decrease by 3 3 37 2 whereas that promoted the degradation of naproxen and ibuprofen with the k increase by 57 3 and 17 5 respectively as br concentration reached 5 µm k s of most ppcps were 6 4 60 4 lower except for bezafibrate gemfibrozil and ibuprofen with k increase by 13 7 19 5 compared to those with 1 µm br although k of naproxen decreased by 8 4 with increasing br concentration from 1 µm to 5 µm it was still significantly higher than that in the absence of br increasing br levels promoted the conversion from so4 to ho where so4 ss and ho ss were 5 8 10 13 m and 3 5 10 13 m at 1 µm br and 1 4 10 13 m and 5 8 10 13 at 5 µm br respectively determined by using the probes of metronidazole and nitrobenzene figs 5 and s8 therefore increasing br concentration from 1 µm to 5 µm significantly decreased the degradation of group i since the roles of ho for ppcp degradation cannot offset the loss of so4 by contrast the slightly decreased degradation of some ppcp in group i was observed because these ppcps had higher reactivity with ho than so4 and roles of ho can compensate for the loss of so4 the role of ho for the degradation of nitroimidazoles sulfamethoxazole chloramphenicol flumequine and nalidixic acid was 100 at 5 µm br by subtracting the contributions of so4 ho pds and uv from the sum k the ppcps including atenolol metoprolol bezafibrate naproxen salbutamol carbamazepine gemfibrozil and ibuprofen had significant degradation via rbs oxidation presumably due to the roles of br and br2 for their high reactivity with electron rich micropollutants hasegawa and neta 1978 grebel et al 2010 yang et al 2014 cheng et al 2018 for instance the k of ibuprofen with br and br2 was determined to be 2 2 109 m 1 s 1 and 5 3 107 m 1 s 1 respectively guo et al 2020 combining to modeling br ss and br2 ss of 2 2 10 12 m and 7 8 10 11 m at 5 µm br respectively the roles of rbs for ibuprofen degradation were 9 4 10 3 s 1 which was consistent to the experimental k of rbs 8 5 10 3 s 1 therefore br at μm levels significantly altered the radical chemistry for ppcp degradation in the uv pds process in which ho and rbs were dominant radicals 4 conclusions and engineering implications fresh water is important for aquatic ecosystem which supplies drinking cooking and sanitation needs for human beings ferris et al 1974 cosgrove and loucks 2015 understanding the radical chemistry of uv pds in the presence of br in fresh water is important for their application in water treatment this study provided a new information on radical chemistry of uv pds in the presence of br at fresh water levels overall br at 1 50 μm can promote the conversion from so4 to ho at neutral and alkaline conditions which is distinguished from the consumption of so4 and ho by br at seawater levels mm levels yang et al 2014 gligorovski et al 2015 parker and mitch 2016 br played a dual role on ho in the uv pds process at ph 7 the ho concentration increased to maximum at 5 μm br and then it was slightly consumed to form rbs including br and br2 at excess br 10 50 μm where the rbs concentrations were 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than those of so4 and ho at ph 7 and 50 μm br accordingly the kʹs of 15 ppcps in uv pds decreased by 15 2 73 9 but those of naproxen and ibuprofen increased by 13 7 57 3 at 1 5 μm br depending on their specific reactivity with so4 ho and rbs the co existence of cl 10 1000 μm with 5 μm br further enhanced the conversion from so4 to ho but rcs was negligible the presence of 1 mm hco3 with 5 μm br efficiently scavenged so4 and ho but slightly affected rbs by contrast 1 mg l nom scavenged ho and rbs more significantly compared to so4 the roles of ho and rbs in the uv pds process with the presence of br at fresh water levels are important br is verified to efficiently degrade some ppcps such as ibuprofen guo et al 2020 salbutamol zhou et al 2019 carbamazepine cheng et al 2018 and flumequine zhang et al 2020b at 107 109 m 1 s 1 thus the formation of toxic brominated products by rbs should be further evaluated surprisingly the formation of tobr brominated dbps and bromate in simulated drinking water containing nom are negligible figs s9 s10 indicating the low risk of the application of uv

17019,bromide br is a typical scavenger to sulfate radical so4 and hydroxyl radical ho which simultaneously forms secondary reactive bromine species rbs such as br and br2 this study investigated the effects of br at fresh water levels μm on the radical chemistry in the uv peroxydisulfate uv pds process by combining the degradation kinetics of probe compounds nitrobenzene metronidazole and benzoate with kinetic model br at 1 50 μm promoted the conversion from so4 to ho and rbs in the uv pds process at ph 7 the concentration of so4 monotonically decreased by 31 5 94 8 at 1 50 μm br while that of ho showed an increasing and then decreasing pattern with a maximum increase by 171 7 at 5 μm br the concentrations of br and br2 10 12 10 10 m were 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than so4 and ho alkaline condition promoted the conversion from so4 to ho and drove the transformation from rbs to ho resulting in much lower concentrations of rbs at ph 10 br at 1 μm and 5 μm decreased the pseudo first order reaction rates kʹs of 15 pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps by 15 2 73 9 but increased kʹs of naproxen and ibuprofen by 13 7 57 3 at ph 7 the co existence of 10 1000 μm cl with 5 μm br further promoted the conversion from so4 to ho compared to br alone bicarbonate consumed so4 and ho but slightly affected rbs while natural organic matter nom exerted scavenging effects on ho and rbs more significantly than so4 this study demonstrated that br at fresh water levels significantly altered the radical chemistry of the uv pds process especially for promoting the formation of ho graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation process sulfate radicals hydroxyl radicals bromide micropollutants water treatment 1 introduction recently sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation process aops have attracted increasing attention to micropollutant degradation such as algal toxins antoniou et al 2010a antoniou et al 2010b pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 lian et al 2017 and perfluorocarboxylic acids hori et al 2005 in aquatic environment so4 can be generated by activating persulfate via ultraviolet uv heat and transition metals etc oh et al 2016 ghanbari and moradi 2017 wang and wang 2018 although the oxidation potential of so4 2 5 3 1 v is comparable to that of hydroxyl radical ho 1 8 2 7 v buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 so4 driven oxidation is much more selective and it possesses higher reactivity toward some micropollutants than ho lee et al 2020a generally so4 can react with h2o

usually the concentrations of br range from undetectable to about 0 5 mg l 6 μm in fresh water who 2009 however the br concentrations are up to 2 mg l 25 μm and 4 13 mg l 52 μm in surface water of israel and australia respectively heller grossman et al 1999 magazinovic et al 2004 prior studies primarily focused on the effects of br at seawater and saline wastewater levels mm on the abatement of micropollutants in so4 based aops but obtained the inconsistent results at ph 7 the degradation of humic acid benzophenone diethyl phthalate salbutamol and terbutaline was decreased by uv pds in the presence of 0 05 10 mm br lou et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 ma et al 2020 wang et al 2020 whereas the degradation of ofloxacin sulfamethoxazole and sulfonamides was promoted in the presence of 0 1 0 8 mm br in the uv pds process at ph 7 wang and wang 2018 zhu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a the decreased degradation is ascribed to the consumption of primary radicals of so4 whereas the enhanced degradation is observed due to their high reactivities with the secondary reactive bromine species rbs such as br and br2 zhou et al 2019 by contrast br 0 2 4 mm had no effect on the degradation of tetrabromobisphenol a in the uv pds process at ph 12 since alkaline ph promoted the formation of ho and br2 and they compensated for the loss of so4 guo et al 2014 to our best knowledge effects of br at fresh water levels 10 μm on degradation kinetics of micropollutants in the uv pds process are rarely studied which need more investigation effects of br on the radical chemistry of so4 based aops have been evaluated but most of which focus on br at wastewater and seawater levels yang et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 specifically br first scavenges so4 to form br and br reacts with br to form br2 eqs 3 4 besides broh can be generated via the reactions of br with oh h2o and ho with br eqs 5 6 and 8 which further reacts with br to form br2 eq 7 or decomposing to br eq 5 and further reacting with br

the dominant radical species in the uv pds process yang et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 wang et al 2020 most studies focused on the conversion from so4 ho to rbs in so4 based aops and primarily investigated roles of rbs on micropollutant degradation with br at seawater levels however effects of br at fresh water levels 10 μm on the radical chemistry of so4 based aops are largely unknown therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the effects of br at fresh water levels on radical chemistry of the uv pds process along with the influences of different factors e g br concentrations solution ph water matrices such as chloride cl bicarbonate hco3 and natural organic matter nom both the probe compound method and modeling simulation were employed where nitrobenzene metronidazole and benzoate were selected as the probe compound of ho so4 and rbs respectively text s1 and 2 to explore the effects of br at fresh water levels on the degradation kinetics of ppcps in

2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of bromide at fresh water level on the conversion of radical species fig 1 compares the effects of br at 0 50 μm on the pseudo first order reaction rates kʹs of nitrobenzene metronidazole and benzoate by the uv pds process at ph 7 and 10 at ph 7 three probe compounds were resistant to pds oxidation with or without the presence of br 0 50 μm fig s6 also the presence of br 1 50 μm had negligible effect on the uv photolysis of probe compounds the k s of nitrobenzene metronidazole and benzoate by uv photolysis were only 5 0 10 5 s 1 9 1 10 4 s 1 and 8 6 10 5 s 1 respectively fig s6 whereas those by uv pds were 9 2 10 4 s 1 2 1 10 2 s 1 and 4 6 10 3 s 1 respectively at ph 7 figs 1a 1c indicating the dominant roles of radicals for probe compound degradation as the br concentrations increased from 0 to 50 μm the k of nitrobenzene k nitrobenzene exhibited an increasing and then decreasing trend with a maximum at 5 μm that was 171 7 2 5 10 3 s 1 higher than that in the absence of br 9 2 10 4 s 1 when the br concentration reached 50 μm the promotive effect was still observed and k nitrobenzene was 19 6 1 1 10 3 s 1 higher than that in the absence of br the k of benzoate k benzoate almost remained stable with 1 10 μm br but significantly decreased by 56 3 at 50 μm br and that of metronidazole k metronidazole monotonically decreased from 1 3 10 2 s 1 to 2 0 10 3 s 1 fig 1 the trends at ph 10 were different from those at ph 7 as the br concentration increased from 0 to 50 μm k nitrobenzene and k benzoate monotonically increased by 67 8 and 55 5 respectively whereas k metronidazole decreased by 19 2 nitrobenzene has higher reactivity with ho 109 m 1 s 1 rather than so4 and rbs 106 m 1 s 1 and metronidazole has higher reactivity with both so4 and ho 109 m 1 s 1 rather than rbs 107 m 1 s 1 table 1 thus the steady state concentrations of ho ho ss and so4 so4 ss were quantified by using k nitrobenzene and k metronidazole in the uv

respectively determined in this study the k metronidazole ho was consistent with that reported by lian et al 2017 3 5 0 4 109 m 1 s 1 the k metronidazole s o 4 was around threefold of that in lian et al 2017 2 7 0 1 109 m 1 s 1 and it determined in this study should be more reliable as the experimental result fitted well the modeling result as described below based on the obtained ho ss and so4 ss table s4 the roles of different radicals on probe compound degradation can be differentiated as the br concentration increased from 0 to 50 μm so4 ss decreased from 2 4 10 12 m to 1 6 10 13 m and ho ss increased from 2 4 10 13 m to a maximum 6 2 10 13 m at 5 μm br and then decreased to 2 6 10 13 m at 50 μm br for metronidazole the contribution of so4 monotonically decreased from 95 6 to 57 4 with increasing br concentration from 0 to 50 μm while that of ho monotonically increased from 4 4 to 42 6 fig 1b besides ho and so4 k benzoate also includes the roles of rbs eq 11 since rbs such as br and br2 are reactive toward benzoate with the rate constants of 6 1 108 m 1 s 1 and 2 106 m 1 s 1 respectively lee et al 2020 11 k benzoate k benzoate ho ho ss k benzaote so4 so4 ss k benzoate rbs k benzoate uv k benzoate ho and k benzoate s o 4 represent the k of benzoate reacting with ho 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 and so4 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 respectively fang et al 2014 k benzoate rbs and k benzoate uv represent the degradation rate of benzoate by rbs and direct uv photolysis respectively at ph 7 the relative contribution of so4 to the degradation of benzoate decreased from 61 8 to 7 3 with increasing br concentration from 0 to 50 μm whereas that of ho increased from 30 2 to a maximum of 81 2 at 5 μm br but decreased to 56 4 at 50 μm br by subtracting the specific k s of uv so4 and ho from the total k benzoate k benzoate rbs increased from 10 2 to 36 3 with increasing br from 1 μm to 50 μm at ph 7 fig 1c at ph 10 so4 ss decreased from 6 6 10 13 m to 2 5 10 13 m and ho ss monotonically increased from 7 3 10 13 m to 1 2 10 12 m for metronidazole the contribution of so4 decreased from 67 4 to 30 6 whereas that of ho increased from 32 6 to 69 4 fig 1e unlike at ph 7 ho had the largest percentage contribution to the overall benzoate degradation at 0 50 μm br 82 2 91 while so4 had a minor contribution 3 2 15 4 and the roles of rbs were negligible fig 1f 3 2 simulation of the steady state radical concentrations by kinetic modeling the kinetic model was employed to simulate the steady state concentrations of radicals as shown in fig 1 and table s4 the modeling concentrations of so4 and ho well fitted the experimental results indicating that the kinetic model was reliable fig 2 compares the variations in the modeling radical concentrations as a function of the br concentration at ph 7 and ph 10 respectively at ph 7 the steady state concentrations of br br ss and br2 br2 ss increased from 9 8 10 13 m to 1 1 10 11 m and increased from 8 5 10 13 m to 9 7 10 10 m respectively as br levels increased from 1 μm to 50 μm the concentrations of br and br2 were 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than those of both so4 and ho whereas that of broh was at much lower concentration 10 15 10 14 m fig 2a by multiplying the modeling concentrations of rbs with the known bimolecular reaction rate constants the specific roles of rbs on the benzoate degradation were evaluated at ph 7 modeling roles of br responsible for benzoate degradation were 7 6 13 5 at 1 50 μm br whereas those of br2 were unimportant at 1 5 μm br and were 11 2 at 10 μm br and 35 4 at 50 μm br respectively at ph 10 the concentrations of rbs were much lower than those at ph 7 br ss and br2 ss were at 10 15 10 13 m in the presence of 1 50 μm br 1 3 orders of magnitude lower than so4 ss and ho ss thus the contributions of br and br2 for benzoate degradation were negligible overall these results indicated that the presence of br at freshwater levels promoted the conversion from so4 to ho and rbs which was distinct from br at saline wastewater or seawater levels as a sink for both so4 and ho in the uv pds process yang et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 3 3 radical chemistry of uv pds with bromide at fresh water levels 3 3 1 the radical chemistry at ph 7 the concentrations of specific radicals depend on their formation and consumption by multiplying the individual concentrations with the bimolecular reaction rate constants the k s of so4 and ho reacting with the probe compounds oxidants br h2o oh and phosphate buffer were calculated and note that reverse reactions were taken into account so4 primarily reacted with br with k s of 3 5 103 1 8 105 s 1 in the presence of 1 50 μm br at ph 7 fig s7a and the k s of so4 reacting with h2o and oh were only 6 6 102 s 1 and 7 0 s 1 respectively peyton 1993 guo et al 2020 suggesting that so4 primarily reacted with br to form br br could react with h2o slowly to form broh and then broh was further decomposed to both ho and br eqs 5 6 and 8 as for ho probe compounds had minor consumption to ho 6 8 103 s 1 while br 1 50 μm primarily quenched ho with the forward k s of 1 1 55 104 s 1 fig s7b although 1 5 μm br rapidly reacted with ho to generate broh with k s of 1 1 5 5 104 s 1 broh was decomposed to ho with k of 3 3 107 s 1 eq 8 the reversible rate is 3 orders of magnitude higher than the forward reaction rate zhang and parker 2018 suggesting the negligible scavenging effect of ho by br that is br 5 μm promoted the conversion of so4 to ho due to the rapid consumption of so4 but slow consumption of ho increasing br levels to 50 μm accelerated the consumption of ho to form broh and also promoted the conversion from broh to br2 at 50 μm br eq 7 thus br 10 50 μm decreased the concentration of ho due to the higher consumption rate of ho resulting in br and br2 being the dominate radicals at 50 μm br and ph 7 3 3 2 the radical chemistry at ph 10 fig s7 also shows the k s of so4 and ho reacting with probe compounds oxidants br h2o oh at ph 10 compared to ph 7 so4 primarily reacted with oh 7 103 s 1 in the absence of br fig s7c resulting in the considerable formation of ho which was consistent with the promotive conversion from so4 to ho at alkaline ph fang et al 2012 lutze et al 2015 the k of so4 reacting with oh at ph 10 7 103 s 1 was comparable to those with 1 10 μm br 3 5 35 103 s 1 indicating the strong competition of the former reaction to reduce the formation of br by the latter at ph 10 compared to ph 7 meanwhile alkaline condition accelerated the reactions of br br2 with oh to form broh eqs 5 and 7 and then enhanced the conversion of broh to ho but not br eq 8 thus ho increased substantially in the presence of 1 50 μm br at ph 10 while rbs were less important overall the effects of br at freshwater levels on the radical chemistry of the uv pds process are illustrated in scheme 1 so4 initially reacts with br to form br and then br primarily reacts with br to form br2 br plays a dual effect on ho at neutral condition br reacts with h2o oh to form broh and then broh is decomposed to both ho and br simultaneously br scavenges ho and finally results in the formation of br and br2 the alkaline condition promotes the conversion from so4 to ho since higher ph values increase oh formation and it also drives the reactions of br br2 with oh to generate broh and then to ho therefore ho is important at both ph 7 and 10 while rbs exerts the predominant role at ph 7 3 4 effects of water matrices on the radical chemistry in the uv pds process 3 4 1 effect of chloride we further evaluated different water matrices on the radical chemistry in the uv pds process at 5 μm br and ph 7 cl and br usually coexist in fresh water thus the effect of halide mixtures on the radical chemistry of uv pds was investigated fig 3 compared to the result at 5 μm br alone k nitrobenzene and k benzoate increased by 8 7 68 3 and 7 8 46 6 respectively in the co existence of 10 1000 μm cl and 5 μm br while k metronidazole slightly increased by 4 9 with 10 μm cl but decreased by 10 26 8 with 100 1000 μm cl in the presence of co existence of cl 10 1000 μm and br 5 μm so4 ss decreased by 16 9 31 4 compared to that in 5 μm br alone while ho ss increased by 10 74 by modeling which were fitted well with the experimental results cl can scavenge so4 to form cl then cl reacts with h2o oh to form cloh and cloh can rapidly decompose to ho lutze et al 2015 zhang and parker 2018 therefore the co presence of cl 10 1000 μm promoted the transformation from so4 to ho than that in br alone while the formation of rcs was less important 10 15 10 13 m table 2 rbs of br ss and br2 ss by modeling were slightly lower than those at 5 μm br alone table 2 as they were transformed to clbr via the reaction of cl and rbs yang et al 2014 yang et al 2016 the concentrations of clbr were 10 14 10 12 m table 2 which were 1 3 orders of magnitude lower than those of rbs a prior research reported that br2 and clbr were the dominant radicals in the coexisting 540 mm cl and 0 8 mm br at seawater levels since br acted as the most important ho scavenger yang et al 2014 unlike halides at seawater levels ho is also an important radical in the presence of halide mixtures at freshwater levels 3 4 2 effect of hco3 in the co existence of 1 mm hco3 and 5 μm br k nitrobenzene k metronidazole and k benzoate significantly decreased by 74 8 50 3 and 67 1 respectively compared to those at 5 μm br alone in the uv pds process fig 4 so4 ss and ho ss by modeling were 4 1 10 13 m and 1 6 10 13 m respectively at 1 mm hco3 and 5 μm br which were 2 and 3 times lower than at 5 μm br alone respectively table 2 br ss and br2 ss by modeling were 5 6 10 13 m and 3 5 10 11 m respectively and they slightly decreased by 37 44 compared to those at 5 μm br alone besides the steady state concentration of carbonate radical co3 was formed at 3 5 10 12 m which was an order of magnitude higher than those of so4 and ho co3 had a negligible contribution for the degradation of three probe compounds via modeling results and br 18 1 contributed to degrade benzoate besides ho 60 4 and so4 21 5 as can be seen the roles of rbs changed slightly for the benzoate abatement at 5 μm br regardless of the presence of hco3 the effect of hco3 on the radical chemistry of uv pds with br at trace levels can be explained by the fractions of so4 ho and rbs scavenged by hco3 hco3 scavenged so4 and ho with rate constants of 9 1 106 m 1 s 1 and 1 107 m 1 s 1 respectively lutze et al 2015 resulting in the consumption of so4 ho to co3 in contrast the rate constants of hco3 with br and br2 were 1 106 m 1 s 1 and 8 104 m 1 s 1 respectively zhang et al 2020b which were 1 3 orders of magnitude lower than those with so4 ho therefore hco3 primarily scavenged so4 and ho to form co3 but less scavenged rbs resulting in br br2 and co3 dominating the uv pds process 3 4 3 effect of nom fig 4 also shows that nom had significant inhibition degradation to three probe compounds k nitrobenzene k metronidazole and k benzoate decreased by 88 1 59 6 and 81 0 respectively in the presence of 1 mg l nom at 5 μm br and ph 7 compared to those at 5 μm br alone so4 ss ho ss br ss and br2 ss by modeling were 3 1 10 13 m 7 5 10 14 m 2 4 10 14 m and 9 9 10 13 m respectively in the presence of 1 mg l nom at 5 μm br in which the concentrations of ho and rbs were 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than those at 5 μm br alone and that of so4 decreased by 2 7 times table 2 although 5 μm br efficiently converted so4 to ho and rbs nom was a stronger sink for ho knom ho 2 5 104 mg l 1 s 1 and rbs knom br 2 5 104 mg l 1 s 1 than so4 2 0 103 mg l 1 s 1 hou et al 2018 guo et al 2020 which caused a more significant decrease of ho and rbs than so4 in addition nom served as an inner filter for uv light to reduce the direct photolysis efficiency of pds and further to decrease the concentrations of so4 fang et al 2014 3 5 effects of bromide at fresh water levels on the degradation kinetics of ppcps effects of br on the abatement of structurally diverse ppcps under environmentally relevant conditions by the uv pds process were further investigated fig 5 shows the effects of br at 1 μm and 5 μm on the degradation kinetics of ppcps 1 μg l by uv pds process at ph 7 in pure water the oxidation of 19 ppcps by pds oxidation or uv photolysis was negligible except for sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol by uv photolysis with the kʹs of 3 6 10 3 s 1 and 1 1 10 3 s 1 respectively in uv pds kʹs of 19 ppcps ranged from 4 2 10 3 s 1 to 3 3 10 2 s 1 so4 ss and ho ss were calculated to be 1 4 10 12 m and 3 1 10 13 m respectively based on the degradation of nitrobenzene and metronidazole respectively eqs 9 10 figs 5 and s8 which were consistent to the modeling results 1 9 10 12 m for so4 ss and 3 3 10 13 m for ho ss to facilitate discussion the 19 ppcps were grouped according to their different reactivities with so4 and ho 1 9 ppcps that were primarily degraded by so4 were defined as group i k s o 4 k ho 0 7 including ornidazole metronidazole dimetridazole ronidazole tinidazole atenolol metoprolol sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol 2 10 ppcps were degraded primarily degraded by ho were defined as group ii k s o 4 k ho 0 7 containing trimethoprim bezafibrate naproxen salbutamol primidone carbamazepine gemfibrozil flumequine nalidixic acid and ibuprofen by multiplying the radical concentrations with the bimolecular reaction rate constants the k s of so4 and ho reacting with a specific ppcp were calculated the roles of so4 were 76 7 80 9 for the degradation of group i whereas those of ho was also significant 35 4 59 7 for the degradation of group ii compared to the absence of br the presence of 1 µm br inhibited the degradation of group i with the decrease of k by 42 5 53 3 interestingly 1 µm br slightly decreased 8 ppcps in group ii with the k decrease by 3 3 37 2 whereas that promoted the degradation of naproxen and ibuprofen with the k increase by 57 3 and 17 5 respectively as br concentration reached 5 µm k s of most ppcps were 6 4 60 4 lower except for bezafibrate gemfibrozil and ibuprofen with k increase by 13 7 19 5 compared to those with 1 µm br although k of naproxen decreased by 8 4 with increasing br concentration from 1 µm to 5 µm it was still significantly higher than that in the absence of br increasing br levels promoted the conversion from so4 to ho where so4 ss and ho ss were 5 8 10 13 m and 3 5 10 13 m at 1 µm br and 1 4 10 13 m and 5 8 10 13 at 5 µm br respectively determined by using the probes of metronidazole and nitrobenzene figs 5 and s8 therefore increasing br concentration from 1 µm to 5 µm significantly decreased the degradation of group i since the roles of ho for ppcp degradation cannot offset the loss of so4 by contrast the slightly decreased degradation of some ppcp in group i was observed because these ppcps had higher reactivity with ho than so4 and roles of ho can compensate for the loss of so4 the role of ho for the degradation of nitroimidazoles sulfamethoxazole chloramphenicol flumequine and nalidixic acid was 100 at 5 µm br by subtracting the contributions of so4 ho pds and uv from the sum k the ppcps including atenolol metoprolol bezafibrate naproxen salbutamol carbamazepine gemfibrozil and ibuprofen had significant degradation via rbs oxidation presumably due to the roles of br and br2 for their high reactivity with electron rich micropollutants hasegawa and neta 1978 grebel et al 2010 yang et al 2014 cheng et al 2018 for instance the k of ibuprofen with br and br2 was determined to be 2 2 109 m 1 s 1 and 5 3 107 m 1 s 1 respectively guo et al 2020 combining to modeling br ss and br2 ss of 2 2 10 12 m and 7 8 10 11 m at 5 µm br respectively the roles of rbs for ibuprofen degradation were 9 4 10 3 s 1 which was consistent to the experimental k of rbs 8 5 10 3 s 1 therefore br at μm levels significantly altered the radical chemistry for ppcp degradation in the uv pds process in which ho and rbs were dominant radicals 4 conclusions and engineering implications fresh water is important for aquatic ecosystem which supplies drinking cooking and sanitation needs for human beings ferris et al 1974 cosgrove and loucks 2015 understanding the radical chemistry of uv pds in the presence of br in fresh water is important for their application in water treatment this study provided a new information on radical chemistry of uv pds in the presence of br at fresh water levels overall br at 1 50 μm can promote the conversion from so4 to ho at neutral and alkaline conditions which is distinguished from the consumption of so4 and ho by br at seawater levels mm levels yang et al 2014 gligorovski et al 2015 parker and mitch 2016 br played a dual role on ho in the uv pds process at ph 7 the ho concentration increased to maximum at 5 μm br and then it was slightly consumed to form rbs including br and br2 at excess br 10 50 μm where the rbs concentrations were 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than those of so4 and ho at ph 7 and 50 μm br accordingly the kʹs of 15 ppcps in uv pds decreased by 15 2 73 9 but those of naproxen and ibuprofen increased by 13 7 57 3 at 1 5 μm br depending on their specific reactivity with so4 ho and rbs the co existence of cl 10 1000 μm with 5 μm br further enhanced the conversion from so4 to ho but rcs was negligible the presence of 1 mm hco3 with 5 μm br efficiently scavenged so4 and ho but slightly affected rbs by contrast 1 mg l nom scavenged ho and rbs more significantly compared to so4 the roles of ho and rbs in the uv pds process with the presence of br at fresh water levels are important br is verified to efficiently degrade some ppcps such as ibuprofen guo et al 2020 salbutamol zhou et al 2019 carbamazepine cheng et al 2018 and flumequine zhang et al 2020b at 107 109 m 1 s 1 thus the formation of toxic brominated products by rbs should be further evaluated surprisingly the formation of tobr brominated dbps and bromate in simulated drinking water containing nom are negligible figs s9 s10 indicating the low risk of the application of uv
