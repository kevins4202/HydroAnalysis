4315,the in well point velocity probe iwpvp was originally developed for use in screened porous media wells the tool can characterize small scale aquifer heterogeneity from wells that have been carefully developed to ensure an open screen and good hydraulic connection with the surrounding aquifer this capability led to the hypothesis that the iwpvp could be adapted to characterize flow in fractured media which features small scale openings i e fractures that resemble screen slots to test this hypothesis a lab scale fracture flow apparatus ffa was fabricated the ffa consisted of two parallel acrylic plates that could be separated by a fixed distance simulating a fracture with a known aperture two lengths of pvc well casing served as a cylindrical access port and were centrally placed in the plates this mock well left the interface with the fracture open analogous to a fracture intersecting an uncased borehole the probe was calibrated experimentally by relating known fluxes through the ffa with those measured inside the iwpvp the ratio of these fluxes was found to be predictable for two aperture sizes 500 μm and 1290 μm based on a flux balance and the cubic law additionally the ability of the probe to discern flow direction in a fracture was tested and found to be accurate within 20 under the conditions of the laboratory testing the results suggest that an iwpvp could be reliably used in fractured media to directly measure horizontal flux and flow direction in a single fracture without reference to darcy s law keywords fractured media flux cubic law point velocity probe groundwater velocity laboratory 1 introduction knowledge of the groundwater flow in discrete fractures is fundamental to assessing risk in contaminated fractured aquifers for example high velocity groundwater flow can significantly spread the extent of contamination in a short period of time also perhaps less intuitively a low flow fracture with a high concentration of a contaminant may generate a negligible contaminant flux compared to another fracture with high flow rates but a lower concentration of the contaminant itrc 2010 traditional techniques for characterizing flow in fractured media have borrowed from porous media investigations including the uses of pumping tests tracer tests slug tests and other methods that create artificially enhanced gradients gernand heidtman 1997 because the storativity of some fractured rock types can be small relative to porous media a result of flow constrained to small high permeability pathways through a comparatively low porosity matrix pumping tests are very strongly influenced by drilling artifacts wellbore storage and skin effects novakowski 1989 to better handle the low storativity values pulse interference tests were developed however they are also subject to well skin effects in addition to requiring several hours to obtain minimum datasets johnson et al 1966 novakowski 1990 researchers have also noted that tracer tests in fractured rock with a network of intersecting fractures are quite difficult to interpret and nonunique model solutions are common tester et al 1982 landstrom et al 1983 a single fracture can be evaluated via tracer injection but it requires detailed prior knowledge of the fracture including its hydraulic connection between the pumping and extraction boreholes precise pumping rates are also essential to deal with the small water volumes and high velocities expected through a fracture the estimation of hydraulic apertures is imprecise and usually depends on assumptions that all identified openings are hydraulically active and the same size in addition induced flow conditions must be assumed absent which can bias estimates of apertures high novakowski et al 1985 parker et al 2012 recent advances in fractured rock hydrogeology have in many cases been achieved using single instrumented boreholes and screened wells e g flux flow meters velocimeters borescopes packer enclosed techniques unfortunately these approaches tend to introduce biases because either directly or as a consequences of their use they produce artificial vertical connections between otherwise isolated discrete fractures novakowski et al 2006 shapiro 2002 sterling et al 2005 as a result the borehole can serve as an artificial conduit in the aquifer the comparatively large volume of a borehole in relation to fractures also makes these conduits noteworthy reservoirs that can affect contaminant detection historically predictions based on pumping and injection tests in open boreholes and wells have led to underestimations of solute spreading berkowitz 2002 over the past two decades specialized technologies have been introduced that are geared towards quantifying the flow in individual fractures these include passive flux meters geophysical techniques heat pulse flow meters colloidal borescopes and acoustic doppler velocimeters e g annable et al 2005 hatfield et al 2004 tsoflias et al 2004 wilson et al 2001 however the performances of these in well devices have been limited by phenomena such as artificial vertical flow in the borehole and borehole induced horizontal flow direction changes that are not representative of natural conditions klammler et al 2016 novakowski et al 2006 shapiro 2002 the isolation of small portions of a borehole with packers can sometimes improve the quality of measurements however tests such as packer enclosed point dilution tests have been reported to exhibit concerning levels of variability and poor proportionality between aperture size and velocity novakowski et al 2006 this establishes that the use of packers is not an assured method of obtaining flow measurements with high levels of confidence in response to the ongoing need for new methods to quantify fracture flow new tools are being developed and tested in fractured media flexible impervious liners flute http www flute com line boreholes and reestablish the isolation of fractures that intersect the borehole cherry et al 2007 depth specific estimates of hydraulic transmissivity can be obtained by recording the rate of descent as the liner is deployed downward within the borehole keller et al 2014 however resolution depends strongly on the depth of the most highly transmissive fractures when these features are found near the bottom of a borehole the resolution of low transmissivity fractures at similar depths can be low once the liner is in place estimates of flow may be obtained using heat sensing instruments positioned between the liner and the formation during deployment pehme et al 2010 the general approach of using temperature to infer flow has also been described using distributed temperature sensing cables installed in the borehole filled with grout selker selker 2018 another promising recent development in this field is a passive flux meter designed explicitly for fractured media by measuring time averaged water and contaminant fluxes and fracture network properties through consolidated rock klammler et al 2016 the device consists of an inflatable core with a thin permeable layer of elastic fabric mesh that contains dye the leaching of dye from the mesh reveals patterns that provide insight into the location and extent of the fracturing the area and extent of the leached zone can in principle be used to estimate the cumulative magnitude of groundwater flow and contaminant mass flux in the relevant fracture s such fluxes were estimated to within about 25 of expected values in controlled laboratory tests however the time to acquire a measurement may be several days to several weeks ruling out the method where quick responses are desired klammler et al 2016 the time averaged nature of the measurements is advantageous for some assessments of risk but the method is poorly suited to record short term surges of water or contaminants which may be relevant for other risk considerations and remedial designs these kinds of variations can occur in response to rain events diurnal flow or concentration variations within a plume a relatively recent tool that may be adaptable to fractured systems and that yields test results in near real time is the in well point velocity probe iwpvp the iwpvp was developed as a tool for deployment in standard monitoring wells to determine groundwater velocity osorno et al 2018 the iwpvp operates by releasing a tracer in the center of the probe and timing its arrival at detectors located in channels leading out of the probe body detector channels fig 1 the flux of water in the probe determined this way reveals the movement of groundwater in the well and through calibration the surrounding aquifer fig 1 a chief advantage of the iwpvp is its ability to circumvent the use of darcy s law therefore eliminating uncertainties associated with hydraulic conductivity k porosity and gradient alexander et al 2011 butler et al 2007 devlin mcelwee 2007 post von asmuth 2013 ricciardi et al 2009 additionally due to the discrete sampling interval of the iwpvp 2 3 cm localized small scale variations of flow in aquifers can be characterized which have been shown to have significant impacts on transport processes bianchi et al 2011 feenstra et al 1984 schillig et al 2016 sudicky 1986 a further advantage of the iwpvp is that the magnification of flow within the device creates extremely short duration measurements typically less than 20 min the short measurement durations allow for many tests to be conducted across a site in a period of a few days rapid site wide sampling or system based testing provides the ability to verify conceptual models with field based flow data this novel portable and reusable device has been demonstrated to rapidly determine depth specific groundwater fluxes both in laboratory and field experiments heyer et al 2019 osorno et al 2018 2020 the success of the original iwpvp s performance in quantifying flow over centimeter scale sections of wells suggested the tool might be used with similar success in fractured media which also exhibits pronounced small scale variations in flow intersecting a borehole berkowitz 2002 cacas et al 1990 as such the iwpvp could serve a complementary role in fractured rock hydrogeological investigations when applied with other novel and conventional systems thus the overall goals of this work were to test the hypothesis that the iwpvp could be used to characterize discrete fractures and modify the probe design as required to optimize that function 2 materials and methods 2 1 fracture flow apparatus design in order to carry out preliminary testing of the iwpvp in a fractured media setting a laboratory scale model of a fracture the fracture flow apparatus ffa was fabricated fig 2 the iwpvp was designed specifically to measure horizontal flow through vertical boreholes so the physical model incorporated a single horizontal fracture the ffa design was similar to that reported by klammler et al 2016 and consisted of two 40 63 cm parallel acrylic sheets positioned at specified distances apart 500 or 1290 µm to emulate single fractures with different apertures although the acrylic plates appeared smooth and flat by visual examination at the micron scale they were found to vary in thickness from one end of a plate to the other in a nearly linear fashion deviations less than 10 up to 500 µm an attempt to plane the surfaces to even out the thickness resulted in only minor improvements therefore an initial aperture size of 500 µm was chosen for testing to ensure there were no partially closed portions of the fracture caused by natural irregularities in the acrylic sheet surfaces later experiments were performed with an aperture size of 1290 µm which was selected to test the hypothesis that a calibration factor of 1 could be predicted a priori using theoretical flux balance equations section 2 3 flow was controlled by a peristaltic pump and introduced to the system via an inlet port located in a channel in the bottom acrylic sheet the flow was permitted to leave the ffa at the opposite end of the system via an outlet channel and port also in the lower plate the channels served as constant head boundaries at each end of the fracture ten smaller ports were added to the bottom plate for the purposes of conducting dye tracer visualization tests red box in fig 2 a hole was cut into each plate to accommodate two short lengths of 5 cm diameter pvc casing which mimicked a well casing to house the iwpvp the 5 cm diameter casing was used to accommodate existing iwpvps built for common porous media monitoring wells the casing lengths terminated at the inside faces of each plate so the fracture transitioned seamlessly into the mock well mimicking an open fracture in connection with an uncased borehole in this work the ffa utilized set screws to establish and maintain as consistent an aperture size as possible across the plates additionally wires with gauges equal to the desired aperture size were placed along the edges of the plates to provide additional support and uniformity to the aperture 2 2 modeling numerical modeling of flow in the laboratory fracture apparatus was carried out for the dual purposes of designing the apparatus and later data interpretation water flux in the fracture was calculated from the cubic law equation 1 q f q f a k f a h 2 b f 3 w ρ g 12 μ h where q f is discharge l3t 1 qf is flux lt 1 a is the cross sectional area for flow l2 2b f is the fracture aperture l kf is a fracture hydraulic conductivity lt 1 w is the fracture width l ρ is water density ml 3 g is acceleration due to gravity lt 2 μ is the coefficient of dynamic viscosity of water ml 1t 1 and h is the hydraulic head l all units are represented here in general form with l length t time m mass two dimensional flow modeling was performed iteratively using excel with a convergence criterion of 0 0001 steady state flow was simulated in the fracture with a finite difference solution to the two dimensional flow equation 2 k fx 2 h x 2 k fy 2 h y 2 0 where x and y are cartesian coordinate values l and kfx kfy are direction specific effective fracture hydraulic conductivities lt 1 constant flux boundaries were used along the inflow and outflow sides of the model and no flow boundaries were used along the sides parallel to flow the model domain size was set to the same dimensions as the ffa 40 cm 63 cm on a 100 66 grid discretization with equal d x and d y values the entire apparatus was modelled to ensure that the boundary conditions had no impact on flow near the well a series of simulations were run with various well diameters to establish that flow results with a 5 cm well were not impacted by the boundaries the acrylic plates appeared smooth and flat to the naked eye but at the micron scale the manufacturing process generated some variation to assess the bias caused by these variations several numerical simulations of the ffa were performed with random deviations from uniformity in the aperture value up to 10 to represent the variation in thickness from manufacturing the 10 variation was chosen based on measurements of plate flatness made during the ffa fabrication and represents a maximum in the observed deviations from flatness this variation was randomly applied to aperture values in every node within a model 2 3 probe calibration the iwpvp was first deployed in the mock well with an orientation that provided flow with a straight path through the probe note that later testing geared at evaluating flow direction assessment involved the probe rotated in the well see section 2 4 iwpvp tests were initially performed with a saline tracer introduced at the top of the central mixing chamber that was allowed to descend via density driven flow as this occurs the groundwater flow through the probe carries the tracer into the detector channel s and over the detector wires among the tests reported here some were conducted with 0 5 g l nacl tracer solutions consistent with common practice in porous media studies with low total dissolved solids groundwater and others with deionized water to be consistent with the practice planned for an upcoming field program to be reported separately tracer injections were accomplished using a syringe pump ne 4000 programmable syringe pump new era pump systems inc tracer volume was restricted to between 0 01 and 0 1 ml which means the average injection volume is less than 10 of the internal probe mixing channel volume these volumes were selected because in prior laboratory testing measured flux inside the probe began to show a positive bias when the injections exceeded 0 1 ml the iwpvp was connected to a cr1000 datalogger campbell scientific through a half bridge circuit using 2 2 kilo ohm resistors details given in devlin et al 2009 the datalogger was programmed to record the resistivity from the detectors at 1 s intervals following the tests the data were downloaded using campbell scientific loggernet v 4 5 software and the breakthrough signals interpreted with velprobepe 3 1 beta d schillig 2012 schillig and devlin 2018 in short the program fits the tracer breakthrough curves btcs with a solution to the advection dispersion equation to obtain a seepage velocity estimate the program also supports analysis of the btcs by the method of moments to similarly obtain an estimate of velocity 2 4 flow direction determination in principle the iwpvp will indicate flow direction to at least 45 due to the quadrant design of the flow channels that controls where water can exit the probe however better estimates of flow direction can be obtained by analyzing the relative amounts of flow in the exiting channels as described by osorno et al 2018 eq 3 the degree to which a direction measurement in the probe is representative of the flow direction in the aquifer depends on the condition of the well screen or filter pack if present if two btcs with signals of similar strength are observed in neighboring channels the overall flow direction is interpreted as a mass weighted vector addition of the contributions from each channel 3 θ app t a n 1 v 1 w 1 v 2 w 2 where θ app is the apparent angle of flow relative to probe channel v 2 v 1 2 are the estimated velocities through each channel and w 1 2 are the mass fraction weights of the tracer assumed equal to areas under the btcs in each channel in order to test the capability of the iwpvp to determine flow direction in the ffa the probe was first emplaced with inlet and outlet channels aligned with the flow direction in a subsequent series of tests the probe was removed from the well rotated approximately 10 and reinstalled this procedure was repeated until a total rotation of 90 was achieved the splitting of tracer between channels was assessed with eq 3 and compared to the known angles between the channels and the actual flow direction all tests were performed in either triplicate or quadruplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessing fracture flow apparatus ffa hydraulics the cubic law equation was utilized in modelling efforts to assess the flow of water through the ffa eq 1 shows the relationship between the specific discharge qf effective fracture hydraulic conductivity kf and the fracture aperture 2b rearranging and combining terms in eq 1 results in eq 4 4 q f q 2 b f w where the denominator term 2b f w represents the cross sectional area to flow a in eq 1 and w is the width of the ffa apparatus 40 cm this calculated estimate of qf was compared to the experimentally derived value obtained by observing the movement of a colored dye through the apparatus for a fracture aperture of 500 µm and a pumping rate of 5 34 ml min eq 4 predicts a qf of 2 56 cm min experimentally under these conditions the dye movement proceeded at 2 65 cm min indicating the ffa was performing as designed fig 3 as a further check on the ffa hydraulics the width of the well capture zone yc the width over which all water is captured and flows through the probe observed in the dye test was compared to the capture width predicted numerically fig 3 in both cases the value of yc was found to be not more than 9 cm 1 cm when the variability in plate thickness was taken into account in the numerical modeling by varying 2b f randomly on a node by node basis and using eq 1 to obtain the corresponding values of kf there was no notable change in the average seepage velocity 6 cm min 2 standard error or capture width these assessments provide corroborating evidence that the apparatus could achieve reliable and predictable baseline velocity data for evaluating the iwpvp over the range of apertures studied 3 2 iwpvp adaptation to fractured settings the iwpvp testing was completed in two phases in the first phase the probe design that was used was taken directly from earlier porous media applications and applied to the ffa as a preliminary test of viability in the second phase the design was modified to improve performance in the fracture setting phase 1 testing established that the iwpvp could record readily identifiable signals i e clear btcs in a fracture environment but in some cases the btcs were bimodal fig 4 a because the software used to interpret btcs relies on curve fitting to the advection dispersion equation the bimodal response is problematic to overcome this challenge it was hypothesized that the peak pairs note downward facing peaks in fig 4 result from the use of salt solution tracer represented two distinct zones of flushing within the iwpvp mixing chamber the first zone was thought to exist approximately in the plane of the fracture the second zone occupied the remaining volume in the mixing chamber above and below the plane of the fracture it was reasoned that if this hypothesis described the phenomena generally correctly the first peak would reflect the flow in the fracture best while the second would be more susceptible to variable mixing efficiency in the probe and perturbations related to the relative probe position and orientation intersecting the fracture the two zone conceptual model of mixing in the probe suggests that all aspects of the detector signals should be sensitive to the overall flushing rate i e the test pumping rates moreover because the two peaks observed in the signals would be expected to flush with different efficiencies the bimodal character of the btcs should change with pumping rate therefore to test the above hypothesis a series of variable flow rate tests were conducted as expected these tests yielded btcs that were dependent on the flow rate at flow rates less than 1 8 ml min tests were characterized by unimodal btcs presumably because flow through the probe was slow enough for the two zones to effectively mix fig 4b at flow rates greater than about 9 ml min the btcs were also characterized by single peaks fig 4c here the higher flow rates are thought to have created turbulent mixing in the probe that again led to well blended tracer mass on and off the fracture plane at intermediate flow rates the bimodal btcs were reproduced tests in this intermediate range produced btcs that behaved as expected the first btc was a linear function of the flow rate in the fracture over a range of specific discharges from 700 cm d to 8000 cm d the second btc exhibited more variability and was only reliably linear up to 3500 cm d through the fracture in phase 2 testing the probe was modified to minimize the signal split and the modifications were evaluated the first modification was to release the tracer in a more controlled fashion in the center of the iwpvp measurement channel preliminary tests were performed using saline tracer in water with low total dissolved solids tds for convenience subsequent detailed testing reported below was conducted with a deionized water di tracer in preparation for field testing at a site with high tds groundwater due to the nature of the detection system measuring electrical resistance the signals that occurred at downward deflections on the mv scale with saline tracer solution occurred as upward deflections with the di water tracer a needle was positioned so that it terminated at the center of the central mixing chamber fig 5 this alteration better localized the initial tracer introduction in the chamber and increased the single btc signal strength over the entire range of velocities tested 700 cm d to 8000 cm d fig 6 in addition this modification effectively eliminated the bimodal character of btcs at all flow rates tested an additional modification to the iwpvp design was made to accommodate the use of both deionized water and saline solutions as tracers insulating shoes were added to the top of the channels mimicking those that were part of the original design for the floor of the probe fig 5 these features ensured that density or buoyancy driven flow that exited the probe on the floor or ceiling did not cause a signal on the detectors osorno et al 2018 only tracer carried through the central portions of the channels due to ambient groundwater flow elicited detector responses density driven flow or buoyancy driven flow were not sensed 3 3 calibration a calibration factor was calculated to convert the measured fluxes in the iwpvp to seepage velocities in the surrounding fracture as described by osorno et al 2018 note that the probe measures a specific discharge qprobe in this case because porosity in the probe is one i e qprobe v nprobe in the case of a single fracture also with a porosity of 1 flux measured in the probe can be converted to discharge in the probe qprobe q qfap where ap is the cross sectional area in a probe channel and given by yprobe 2bprobe 27 mm 4 5 mm which must be equal to flow in the portion of the fracture captured by the well containing the probe i e the capture zone the cubic law eq 1 can then be used to estimate the water flux in the fracture qf 5 q f q probe 2 b f y c where yc is the capture zone width defined above eq 5 can be developed both for the fracture and for the detector channels in the probe fig 1 since q is common to the probe and the fracture capture zone it follows that q q f 2 b f y c q q probe 2 b probe y probe 6 q probe q f 2 b f y c 2 b probe y probe equation 6 shows that the ratio of fluxes i e the calibration factor in the probe and that the fracture is a function of the fracture aperture if the capture width is known in advance recall 2b probe yprobe are known constants determined in the probe design this relationship reduces to a simple linear one however the cubic law eq 1 indicates that the capture zone width varies inversely with the cube of fracture aperture so if yc is uncertain eqs 5 and 6 could propagate considerable error to the estimation of qf this possibility was evaluated experimentally and with numerical modeling the fluxes measured with the probe were plotted against the predicted fluxes from eq 5 fig 8 the calibration line was found to be linear but lower in slope than the previously observed lines for porous media applications this difference is easily understood on the basis of eq 6 and its porous medium equivalent see eq 7 for porous media equation 6 becomes q probe q capture 1 q probe y probe 2 b probe q pm y c z pm 7 q probe q pm y c z pm 2 b probe y probe where zpm and yc are the vertical and horizontal extents of the capture zone of the well respectively and qcapture is the flow in the formation captured by the well fig 7 according to ogilvi 1958 as reported by halevy et al 1967 for a well of diameter 5 1 cm with no filter pack and a screen with permeability much greater than the surrounding formation the follow equation applies 8 α sc 4 1 r w r 2 2 k 2 k 1 1 r w r 2 2 where α sc is the convergence factor for a screened well dimensionless rw is the inside radius of the well l r2 is the outside radius of the well l k1 is the hydraulic conductivity or permeability of well screen lt 1 k2 is the hydraulic conductivity or permeability of the formation lt 1 for open boreholes in fractured media rw r2 so equation 12 simplifies to α sc 2 equation 7 can be evaluated using data from iwpvp testing in porous media as reported by osorno et al 2018 if the vertical capture distance is assumed the same in the probe and the formation zpm yprobe see fig 7 we approximate y c 2 d w 2 51 m m 102 m m the probe channel height is 2 b probe 4 5 m m this leads to a value of qprobe qpm of 23 which is comparable to the modeled value of 18 6 reported by osorno et al 2018 the difference might be attributable to an overestimate of yc using the ogilvy formula due to the presence of the iwpvp in the well which is not accounted for in the formula experimentally osorno et al 2018 determined the ratio qprobe vpm where vpm is the seepage velocity in the porous medium outside the well they reported ratios between 6 17 and 8 44 which are within the expected range if the porosity of the porous medium is assumed to be between 0 33 and 0 45 i e qprobe vpm qprobe qpm n for fractured media equation 6 predicts that the calibration slope varies linearly with the fracture aperture 2b f equation 8 indicates that as long as k1 k2 yc is invariant for a particular well under this condition when the aperture is fixed at 500 μm 0 5 mm and allowing yc 2dw 102 mm the slope is expected to be about 0 4 0 5 mm 102 mm 4 5 mm 27 mm experimentally a calibration series with qf varying between 700 cm d and 8 000 cm d produced a slope of 0 44 which is in good agreement with the predicted slope the variation of duplicate measurements was within 25 using the method of devlin 1996 the lowest three calibration points spanning the range 0 to 2700 cm d were used to estimate a flow detection limit mdl with this calibration the mdl was found to be about 500 cm d in the 500 μm fracture tests fig 8 however recalibration over a lower range of fracture fluxes is required to accurately determine the limits of the instrument at low flow rates since the entire range of the calibration was found to be linear no upper bound could be determined in these tests nonetheless the highest measurable fluxes are shown to be greater than about 8000 cm d an additional calibration series was undertaken with a fracture aperture of 1290 μm in the ffa again applying equation 6 the slope of the calibration line was estimated to be 1 1 1 29 mm 102 mm 4 5 mm 27 mm experimentally the slope of the calibration line was found to be 1 0 again in agreement with expectations once again the data points defining the calibration line generally fell within the 25 error envelope fig 8 the mdl for this calibration range 0 to 1000 cm d flux in fracture was found to be about 190 cm d of course recalibration over a lower range of fluxes would reduce this estimate of mdl the similarity between experimental and estimated calibration factors demonstrates the viability and accuracy of the iwpvp as tool for measuring flow in the laboratory ffa 3 4 flow direction determination the iwpvp is in principle able to determine flow direction in addition to magnitude an assessment of the iwpvp flow direction measurements for the fractured media application was made in a series of tests in which qf was fixed at 4000 cm d the fracture aperture was set to 500 µm and the iwpvp was systematically rotated by 10 establishing a total arc of 90 for practical reasons the absolute direction of flow within the ffa was unchanging equation 3 was applied to determine the flow direction angle relative to a predetermined channel on the probe the test series demonstrated that the probe was generally able to predict flow direction correctly to within about 15 while still accurately quantifying the flux performance is comparable to the 15 reported by osorno et al 2018 for the probe in porous media table 1 fig 9 however it was noted that when flow was aligned with the probe channels so that water could take a straight path through the probe within 10 the estimated flow directions exhibited a slightly greater uncertainty estimated to be 20 4 conclusions this work was conducted to determine if the iwpvp could function usefully in a fractured media setting the medium tested was an extreme case of such a setting one with a single fracture intersecting a borehole instrumented with the iwpvp the linear calibrations of the instrument in two different aperture fractures leads to the conclusion that the iwpvp is a viable tool for characterizing flow in these settings it is expected that in more highly fractured settings flow through the probe will be less discrete and overall performance will only improve this expectation remains for future testing and field trials on the basis of close agreement between calculated and experimental testing results it is concluded that the ffa established near ideal conditions representative of a single fracture conducting water flow laboratory testing of the iwpvp demonstrated that the best probe performance was achieved when small volumes of tracer were delivered to the center of the probe s mixing chamber a modified injection system enhanced iwpvp performance for both saline and deionized water tracers it is further concluded from this work that the iwpvp performs well for the quantification of horizontal water flux through single horizontal fractures the flux measured within the probe responds linearly to flow in surrounding fractures up to about qf 80 m d moreover under idealized conditions the probe is capable of quantifying flow directions within about 20 this level of confidence in flow directions may not be achievable in all field settings but assuming good hydraulic connections between the fractures and the borehole containing the probe flow directions should be distinguishable at least between quadrants as indicated by tracer transport out of probe i e 45 note that these measurements are highly localized so even with this degree of uncertainty on the flow direction the data may be quite useful especially when combined with other localized measurements in order to gain an understanding of larger scale trends it is also concluded that if the capture width of a borehole intersecting a fracture can be estimated reasonably and if it may be considered invariant or minimally variable over a testing period then the iwpvp response will vary linearly with the fracture aperture assuming a simple horizontal isolated fracture conversely if fracture apertures are known from other independent sources e g hydraulic tests or borehole logs then a measured flux in the probe can be used to estimate water flux in an intersecting fracture given the linear responses reported above and the linear responses of the iwpvp in porous media applications as demonstrated by osorno et al 2018 it is expected that the iwpvp will also respond linearly where dense fracture sets intersect a borehole additional testing is needed to verify that similar responses are associated with intermediate fracture densities or non horizontal fracture orientations in addition this work demonstrates the viability of the iwpvp as a tool for characterizing fractured media it provides a fast small scale measurement of flux while exerting virtually no perturbation on the existing flow in combination with other methods capable of surveying entire boreholes for locations of likely active fractures this tool promises to serve in a complementary fashion for obtaining accurate localized measurements of water movement in fractured rock in an economical fashion future work will involve field deployment of the tool at a fractured rock site and investigation into methods to estimate calibration factors in a field setting in addition further work will be conducted to better establish the lower end of the calibration ranges and the instrument s flux detection limit in various fracture settings credit authorship contribution statement b r heyer conceptualization

4315,the in well point velocity probe iwpvp was originally developed for use in screened porous media wells the tool can characterize small scale aquifer heterogeneity from wells that have been carefully developed to ensure an open screen and good hydraulic connection with the surrounding aquifer this capability led to the hypothesis that the iwpvp could be adapted to characterize flow in fractured media which features small scale openings i e fractures that resemble screen slots to test this hypothesis a lab scale fracture flow apparatus ffa was fabricated the ffa consisted of two parallel acrylic plates that could be separated by a fixed distance simulating a fracture with a known aperture two lengths of pvc well casing served as a cylindrical access port and were centrally placed in the plates this mock well left the interface with the fracture open analogous to a fracture intersecting an uncased borehole the probe was calibrated experimentally by relating known fluxes through the ffa with those measured inside the iwpvp the ratio of these fluxes was found to be predictable for two aperture sizes 500 μm and 1290 μm based on a flux balance and the cubic law additionally the ability of the probe to discern flow direction in a fracture was tested and found to be accurate within 20 under the conditions of the laboratory testing the results suggest that an iwpvp could be reliably used in fractured media to directly measure horizontal flux and flow direction in a single fracture without reference to darcy s law keywords fractured media flux cubic law point velocity probe groundwater velocity laboratory 1 introduction knowledge of the groundwater flow in discrete fractures is fundamental to assessing risk in contaminated fractured aquifers for example high velocity groundwater flow can significantly spread the extent of contamination in a short period of time also perhaps less intuitively a low flow fracture with a high concentration of a contaminant may generate a negligible contaminant flux compared to another fracture with high flow rates but a lower concentration of the contaminant itrc 2010 traditional techniques for characterizing flow in fractured media have borrowed from porous media investigations including the uses of pumping tests tracer tests slug tests and other methods that create artificially enhanced

interference tests were developed however they are also subject to well skin effects in addition to requiring several hours to obtain minimum datasets johnson et al 1966 novakowski 1990 researchers have also noted that tracer tests in fractured rock with a network of intersecting fractures are quite difficult to interpret and nonunique model solutions are common tester et al 1982 landstrom et al 1983 a single fracture can be evaluated via tracer injection but it requires detailed prior knowledge of the fracture including its hydraulic connection between the pumping and extraction boreholes precise pumping rates are also essential to deal with the small water volumes and high velocities expected through a fracture the estimation of hydraulic apertures is imprecise and usually depends on assumptions that all identified openings are hydraulically active and the same size in addition induced flow conditions must be assumed absent which can bias estimates of apertures high novakowski et al 1985 parker et al 2012 recent advances in fractured rock hydrogeology have in many cases been achieved using single instrumented boreholes and screened wells e g flux flow meters velocimeters borescopes packer enclosed techniques unfortunately these approaches tend to introduce biases because either directly or as a consequences of their use they produce artificial vertical connections between otherwise isolated discrete fractures novakowski et al 2006 shapiro 2002 sterling et al 2005 as a result the borehole can serve as an artificial conduit in the aquifer the comparatively large volume of a borehole in relation to fractures also makes these conduits noteworthy reservoirs that can affect contaminant detection historically predictions based on pumping and injection tests in open boreholes and wells have led to underestimations of solute spreading berkowitz 2002 over the past two decades specialized technologies have been introduced that are geared towards quantifying the flow in individual fractures these include passive flux meters geophysical techniques heat pulse flow meters colloidal borescopes and acoustic doppler velocimeters e g annable et al 2005 hatfield et al 2004 tsoflias et al 2004 wilson et al 2001 however the performances of these in well devices have been limited by phenomena such as artificial vertical flow in the borehole and borehole induced horizontal flow direction changes that are not representative of natural conditions klammler et al 2016 novakowski et al 2006 shapiro 2002 the isolation of small portions of a borehole with packers can sometimes improve the quality of measurements however tests such as packer enclosed point dilution tests have been reported to exhibit concerning levels of variability and poor proportionality between aperture size and velocity novakowski et al 2006 this establishes that the use of packers is not an assured method of obtaining flow measurements with high levels of confidence in response to the ongoing need for new methods to quantify fracture flow new tools are being developed and tested in fractured media flexible impervious liners flute http www flute com line boreholes and reestablish the isolation of fractures that intersect the borehole cherry et al 2007 depth specific estimates of hydraulic transmissivity can be obtained by recording the rate of descent as the liner is deployed downward within the borehole keller et al 2014 however resolution depends strongly on the depth of the most highly transmissive fractures when these features are found near the bottom of a borehole the resolution of low transmissivity fractures at similar depths can be low once the liner is in place estimates of flow may be obtained using heat sensing instruments positioned between the liner and the formation during deployment pehme et al 2010 the general approach of using temperature to infer flow has also been described using distributed temperature sensing cables installed in the borehole filled with grout selker selker 2018 another promising recent development in this field is a passive flux meter designed explicitly for fractured media by measuring time averaged water and contaminant fluxes and fracture network properties through consolidated rock klammler et al 2016 the device consists of an inflatable core with a thin permeable layer of elastic fabric mesh that contains dye the leaching of dye from the mesh reveals patterns that provide insight into the location and extent of the fracturing the area and extent of the leached zone can in principle be used to estimate the cumulative magnitude of groundwater flow and contaminant mass flux in the relevant fracture s such fluxes were estimated to within about 25 of expected values in controlled laboratory tests however the time to acquire a measurement may be several days to several weeks ruling out the method where quick responses are desired klammler et al 2016 the time averaged nature of the measurements is advantageous for some assessments of risk but the method is poorly suited to record short term surges of water or contaminants which may be relevant for other risk considerations and remedial designs these kinds of variations can occur in response to rain events diurnal flow or concentration variations within a plume a relatively recent tool that may be adaptable to fractured systems and that yields test results in near real time is the in well point velocity probe iwpvp the iwpvp was developed as a tool for deployment in standard monitoring wells to determine groundwater velocity osorno et al 2018 the iwpvp operates by releasing a tracer in the center of the probe and timing its arrival at detectors located in channels leading out of the probe body detector channels fig 1 the flux of water in the probe determined this way reveals the movement of groundwater in the well and through calibration the surrounding aquifer fig 1 a chief advantage of the iwpvp is its ability to circumvent the use of darcy s law therefore eliminating uncertainties associated with hydraulic conductivity k porosity and gradient alexander et al 2011 butler et al 2007 devlin mcelwee 2007 post von asmuth 2013 ricciardi et al 2009 additionally due to the discrete sampling interval of the iwpvp 2 3 cm localized small scale variations of flow in aquifers can be characterized which have been shown to have significant impacts on transport processes bianchi et al 2011 feenstra et al 1984 schillig et al 2016 sudicky 1986 a further advantage of the iwpvp is that the magnification of flow within the device creates extremely short duration measurements typically less than 20 min the short measurement durations allow for many tests to be conducted across a site in a period of a few days rapid site wide sampling or system based testing provides the ability to verify conceptual models with field based flow data this novel portable and reusable device has been demonstrated to rapidly determine depth specific groundwater fluxes both in laboratory and field experiments heyer et al 2019 osorno et al 2018 2020 the success of the original iwpvp s performance in quantifying flow over centimeter scale sections of wells suggested the tool might be used with similar success in fractured media which also exhibits pronounced small scale variations in flow intersecting a borehole berkowitz 2002 cacas et al 1990 as such the iwpvp could serve a complementary role in fractured rock hydrogeological investigations when applied with other novel and conventional systems thus the overall goals of this work were to test the hypothesis that the iwpvp could be used to characterize discrete fractures and modify the probe design as required to optimize that function 2 materials and methods 2 1 fracture flow apparatus design in order to carry out preliminary testing of the iwpvp in a fractured media setting a laboratory scale model of a fracture the fracture flow apparatus ffa was fabricated fig 2 the iwpvp was designed specifically to measure horizontal flow through vertical boreholes so the physical model incorporated a single horizontal fracture the ffa design was similar to that reported by klammler et al 2016 and consisted of two 40 63 cm parallel acrylic sheets positioned at specified distances apart 500 or 1290 µm to emulate single fractures with different apertures although the acrylic plates appeared smooth and flat by visual examination at the micron scale they were found to vary in thickness from one end of a plate to the other in a nearly linear fashion deviations less than 10 up to 500 µm an attempt to plane the surfaces to even out the thickness resulted in only minor improvements therefore an initial aperture size of 500 µm was chosen for testing to ensure there were no partially closed portions of the fracture caused by natural irregularities in the acrylic sheet surfaces later experiments were performed with an aperture size of 1290 µm which was selected to test the hypothesis that a calibration factor of 1 could be predicted a priori using theoretical flux balance equations section 2 3 flow was controlled by a peristaltic pump and introduced to the system via an inlet port located in a channel in the bottom acrylic sheet the flow was permitted to leave the ffa at the opposite end of the system via an outlet channel and port also in the lower plate the channels served as constant head boundaries at each end of the fracture ten smaller ports were added to the bottom plate for the purposes of conducting dye tracer visualization tests red box in fig 2 a hole was cut into each plate to accommodate two short lengths of 5 cm diameter pvc casing which mimicked a well casing to house the iwpvp the 5 cm diameter casing was used to accommodate existing iwpvps built for common porous media monitoring wells the casing lengths terminated at the inside faces of each plate so the fracture transitioned seamlessly into the mock well mimicking an open fracture in connection with an uncased borehole in this work the ffa utilized set screws to establish and maintain as consistent an aperture size as possible across the plates additionally wires with gauges equal to the desired aperture size were placed along the edges of the plates to provide additional support and uniformity to the aperture 2 2 modeling numerical modeling of flow in the laboratory fracture apparatus was carried out for the dual purposes of designing the apparatus and later data interpretation water flux in the fracture was calculated from the cubic law equation 1 q f q f a k f a h 2 b f 3 w ρ g 12 μ h where q f is discharge l3t 1 qf is flux lt 1 a is the cross sectional area for flow l2 2b f is the fracture aperture l kf is a fracture hydraulic conductivity lt 1 w is the fracture width l ρ is water density ml 3 g is acceleration due to gravity lt 2 μ is the coefficient of dynamic viscosity of water ml 1t 1 and h is the hydraulic head l all units are represented here in general form with l length t time m mass two dimensional flow modeling was performed iteratively using excel with a convergence criterion of 0 0001 steady state flow was simulated in the fracture with a finite difference solution to the two dimensional flow equation 2 k fx 2 h x 2 k fy 2 h y 2 0 where x and y are cartesian coordinate values l and kfx kfy are direction specific effective fracture hydraulic conductivities lt 1 constant flux boundaries were used along the inflow and outflow sides of the model and no flow boundaries were used along the sides parallel to flow the model domain size was set to the same dimensions as the ffa 40 cm 63 cm on a 100 66 grid discretization with equal d x and d y values the entire apparatus was modelled to ensure that the boundary conditions had no impact on flow near the well a series of simulations were run with various well diameters to establish that flow results with a 5 cm well were not impacted by the boundaries the acrylic plates appeared smooth and flat to the naked eye but at the micron scale the manufacturing process generated some variation to assess the bias caused by these variations several numerical simulations of the ffa were performed with random deviations from uniformity in the aperture value up to 10 to represent the variation in thickness from manufacturing the 10 variation was chosen based on measurements of plate flatness made during the ffa fabrication and represents a maximum in the observed deviations from flatness this variation was randomly applied to aperture values in every node within a model 2 3 probe calibration the iwpvp was first deployed in the mock well with an orientation that provided flow with a straight path through the probe note that later testing geared at evaluating flow direction assessment involved the probe rotated in the well see section 2 4 iwpvp tests were initially performed with a saline tracer introduced at the top of the central mixing chamber that was allowed to descend via density driven flow as this occurs the groundwater flow through the probe carries the tracer into the detector channel s and over the detector wires among the tests reported here some were conducted with 0 5 g l nacl tracer solutions consistent with common practice in porous media studies with low total dissolved solids groundwater and others with deionized water to be consistent with the practice planned for an upcoming field program to be reported separately tracer injections were accomplished using a syringe pump ne 4000 programmable syringe pump new era pump systems inc tracer volume was restricted to between 0 01 and 0 1 ml which means the average injection volume is less than 10 of the internal probe mixing channel volume these volumes were selected because in prior laboratory testing measured flux inside the probe began to show a positive bias when the injections exceeded 0 1 ml the iwpvp was connected to a cr1000 datalogger campbell scientific through a half bridge circuit using 2 2 kilo ohm resistors details given in devlin et al 2009 the datalogger was programmed to record the resistivity from the detectors at 1 s intervals following the tests the data were downloaded using campbell scientific loggernet v 4 5 software and the breakthrough signals interpreted with velprobepe 3 1 beta d schillig 2012 schillig and devlin 2018 in short the program fits the tracer breakthrough curves btcs with a solution to the advection dispersion equation to obtain a seepage velocity estimate the program also supports analysis of the btcs by the method of moments to similarly obtain an estimate of velocity 2 4 flow direction determination in principle the iwpvp will indicate flow direction to at least 45 due to the quadrant design of the flow channels that controls where water can exit the probe however better estimates of flow direction can be obtained by analyzing the relative amounts of flow in the exiting channels as described by osorno et al 2018 eq 3 the degree to which a direction measurement in the probe is representative of the flow direction in the aquifer depends on the condition of the well screen or filter pack if present if two btcs with signals of similar strength are observed in neighboring channels the overall flow direction is interpreted as a mass weighted vector addition of the contributions from each channel 3 θ app t a n 1 v 1 w 1 v 2 w 2 where θ app is the apparent angle of flow relative to probe channel v 2 v 1 2 are the estimated velocities through each channel and w 1 2 are the mass fraction weights of the tracer assumed equal to areas under the btcs in each channel in order to test the capability of the iwpvp to determine flow direction in the ffa the probe was first emplaced with inlet and outlet channels aligned with the flow direction in a subsequent series of tests the probe was removed from the well rotated approximately 10 and reinstalled this procedure was repeated until a total rotation of 90 was achieved the splitting of tracer between channels was assessed with eq 3 and compared to the known angles between the channels and the actual flow direction all tests were performed in either triplicate or quadruplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessing fracture flow apparatus ffa hydraulics the cubic law equation was utilized in modelling efforts to assess the flow of water through the ffa eq 1 shows the relationship between the specific discharge qf effective fracture hydraulic conductivity kf and the fracture aperture 2b rearranging and combining terms in eq 1 results in eq 4 4 q f q 2 b f w where the denominator term 2b f w represents the cross sectional area to flow a in eq 1 and w is the width of the ffa apparatus 40 cm this calculated estimate of qf was compared to the experimentally derived value obtained by observing the movement of a colored dye through the apparatus for a fracture aperture of 500 µm and a pumping rate of 5 34 ml min eq 4 predicts a qf of 2 56 cm min experimentally under these conditions the dye movement proceeded at 2 65 cm min indicating the ffa was performing as designed fig 3 as a further check on the ffa hydraulics the width of the well capture zone yc the width over which all water is captured and flows through the probe observed in the dye test was compared to the capture width predicted numerically fig 3 in both cases the value of yc was found to be not more than 9 cm 1 cm when the variability in plate thickness was taken into account in the numerical modeling by varying 2b f randomly on a node by node basis and using eq 1 to obtain the corresponding values of kf there was no notable change in the average seepage velocity 6 cm min 2 standard error or capture width these assessments provide corroborating evidence that the apparatus could achieve reliable and predictable baseline velocity data for evaluating the iwpvp over the range of apertures studied 3 2 iwpvp adaptation to fractured settings the iwpvp testing was completed in two phases in the first phase the probe design that was used was taken directly from earlier porous media applications and applied to the ffa as a preliminary test of viability in the second phase the design was modified to improve performance in the fracture setting phase 1 testing established that the iwpvp could record readily identifiable signals i e clear btcs in a fracture environment but in some cases the btcs were bimodal fig 4 a because the software used to interpret btcs relies on curve fitting to the advection dispersion equation the bimodal response is problematic to overcome this challenge it was hypothesized that the peak pairs note downward facing peaks in fig 4 result from the use of salt solution tracer represented two distinct zones of flushing within the iwpvp mixing chamber the first zone was thought to exist approximately in the plane of the fracture the second zone occupied the remaining volume in the mixing chamber above and below the plane of the fracture it was reasoned that if this hypothesis described the phenomena generally correctly the first peak would reflect the flow in the fracture best while the second would be more susceptible to variable mixing efficiency in the probe and perturbations related to the relative probe position and orientation intersecting the fracture the two zone conceptual model of mixing in the probe suggests that all aspects of the detector signals should be sensitive to the overall flushing rate i e the test pumping rates moreover because the two peaks observed in the signals would be expected to flush with different efficiencies the bimodal character of the btcs should change with pumping rate therefore to test the above hypothesis a series of variable flow rate tests were conducted as expected these tests yielded btcs that were dependent on the flow rate at flow rates less than 1 8 ml min tests were characterized by unimodal btcs presumably because flow through the probe was slow enough for the two zones to effectively mix fig 4b at flow rates greater than about 9 ml min the btcs were also characterized by single peaks fig 4c here the higher flow rates are thought to have created turbulent mixing in the probe that again led to well blended tracer mass on and off the fracture plane at intermediate flow rates the bimodal btcs were reproduced tests in this intermediate range produced btcs that behaved as expected the first btc was a linear function of the flow rate in the fracture over a range of specific discharges from 700 cm d to 8000 cm d the second btc exhibited more variability and was only reliably linear up to 3500 cm d through the fracture in phase 2 testing the probe was modified to minimize the signal split and the modifications were evaluated the first modification was to release the tracer in a more controlled fashion in the center of the iwpvp measurement channel preliminary tests were performed using saline tracer in water with low total dissolved solids tds for convenience subsequent detailed testing reported below was conducted with a deionized water di tracer in preparation for field testing at a site with high tds groundwater due to the nature of the detection system measuring electrical resistance the signals that occurred at downward deflections on the mv scale with saline tracer solution occurred as upward deflections with the di water tracer a needle was positioned so that it terminated at the center of the central mixing chamber fig 5 this alteration better localized the initial tracer introduction in the chamber and increased the single btc signal strength over the entire range of velocities tested 700 cm d to 8000 cm d fig 6 in addition this modification effectively eliminated the bimodal character of btcs at all flow rates tested an additional modification to the iwpvp design was made to accommodate the use of both deionized water and saline solutions as tracers insulating shoes were added to the top of the channels mimicking those that were part of the original design for the floor of the probe fig 5 these features ensured that density or buoyancy driven flow that exited the probe on the floor or ceiling did not cause a signal on the detectors osorno et al 2018 only tracer carried through the central portions of the channels due to ambient groundwater flow elicited detector responses density driven flow or buoyancy driven flow were not sensed 3 3 calibration a calibration factor was calculated to convert the measured fluxes in the iwpvp to seepage velocities in the surrounding fracture as described by osorno et al 2018 note that the probe measures a specific discharge qprobe in this case because porosity in the probe is one i e qprobe v nprobe in the case of a single fracture also with a porosity of 1 flux measured in the probe can be converted to discharge in the probe qprobe q qfap where ap is the cross sectional area in a probe channel and given by yprobe 2bprobe 27 mm 4 5 mm which must be equal to flow in the portion of the fracture captured by the well containing the probe i e the capture zone the cubic law eq 1 can then be used to estimate the water flux in the fracture qf 5 q f q probe 2 b f y c where yc is the capture zone width defined above eq 5 can be developed both for the fracture and for the detector channels in the probe fig 1 since q is common to the probe and the fracture capture zone it follows that q q f 2 b f y c q q probe 2 b probe y probe 6 q probe q f 2 b f y c 2 b probe y probe equation 6 shows that the ratio of fluxes i e the calibration factor in the probe and that the fracture is a function of the fracture aperture if the capture width is known in advance recall 2b probe yprobe are known constants determined in the probe design this relationship reduces to a simple linear one however the cubic law eq 1 indicates that the capture zone width varies inversely with the cube of fracture aperture so if yc is uncertain eqs 5 and 6 could propagate considerable error to the estimation of qf this possibility was evaluated experimentally and with numerical modeling the fluxes measured with the probe were plotted against the predicted fluxes from eq 5 fig 8 the calibration line was found to be linear but lower in slope than the previously observed lines for porous media applications this difference is easily understood on the basis of eq 6 and its porous medium equivalent see eq 7 for porous media equation 6 becomes q probe q capture 1 q probe y probe 2 b probe q pm y c z pm 7 q probe q pm y c z pm 2 b probe y probe where zpm and yc are the vertical and horizontal extents of the capture zone of the well respectively and qcapture is the flow in the formation captured by the well fig 7 according to ogilvi 1958 as reported by halevy et al 1967 for a well of diameter 5 1 cm with no filter pack and a screen with permeability much greater than the surrounding formation the follow equation applies 8 α sc 4 1 r w r 2 2 k 2 k 1 1 r w r 2 2 where α sc is the convergence factor for a screened well dimensionless rw is the inside radius of the well l r2 is the outside radius of the well l k1 is the hydraulic conductivity or permeability of well screen lt 1 k2 is the hydraulic conductivity or permeability of the formation lt 1 for open boreholes in fractured media rw r2 so equation 12 simplifies to α sc 2 equation 7 can be evaluated using data from iwpvp testing in porous media as reported by osorno et al 2018 if the vertical capture distance is assumed the same in the probe and the formation zpm yprobe see fig 7 we approximate y c 2 d w 2 51 m m 102 m m the probe channel height is 2 b probe 4 5 m m this leads to a value of qprobe qpm of 23 which is comparable to the modeled value of 18 6 reported by osorno et al 2018 the difference might be attributable to an overestimate of yc using the ogilvy formula due to the presence of the iwpvp in the well which is not accounted for in the formula experimentally osorno et al 2018 determined the ratio qprobe vpm where vpm is the seepage velocity in the porous medium outside the well they reported ratios between 6 17 and 8 44 which are within the expected range if the porosity of the porous medium is assumed to be between 0 33 and 0 45 i e qprobe vpm qprobe qpm n for fractured media equation 6 predicts that the calibration slope varies linearly with the fracture aperture 2b f equation 8 indicates that as long as k1 k2 yc is invariant for a particular well under this condition when the aperture is fixed at 500 μm 0 5 mm and allowing yc 2dw 102 mm the slope is expected to be about 0 4 0 5 mm 102 mm 4 5 mm 27 mm experimentally a calibration series with qf varying between 700 cm d and 8 000 cm d produced a slope of 0 44 which is in good agreement with the predicted slope the variation of duplicate measurements was within 25 using the method of devlin 1996 the lowest three calibration points spanning the range 0 to 2700 cm d were used to estimate a flow detection limit mdl with this calibration the mdl was found to be about 500 cm d in the 500 μm fracture tests fig 8 however recalibration over a lower range of fracture fluxes is required to accurately determine the limits of the instrument at low flow rates since the entire range of the calibration was found to be linear no upper bound could be determined in these tests nonetheless the highest measurable fluxes are shown to be greater than about 8000 cm d an additional calibration series was undertaken with a fracture aperture of 1290 μm in the ffa again applying equation 6 the slope of the calibration line was estimated to be 1 1 1 29 mm 102 mm 4 5 mm 27 mm experimentally the slope of the calibration line was found to be 1 0 again in agreement with expectations once again the data points defining the calibration line generally fell within the 25 error envelope fig 8 the mdl for this calibration range 0 to 1000 cm d flux in fracture was found to be about 190 cm d of course recalibration over a lower range of fluxes would reduce this estimate of mdl the similarity between experimental and estimated calibration factors demonstrates the viability and accuracy of the iwpvp as tool for measuring flow in the laboratory ffa 3 4 flow direction determination the iwpvp is in principle able to determine flow direction in addition to magnitude an assessment of the iwpvp flow direction measurements for the fractured media application was made in a series of tests in which qf was fixed at 4000 cm d the fracture aperture was set to 500 µm and the iwpvp was systematically rotated by 10 establishing a total arc of 90 for practical reasons the absolute direction of flow within the ffa was unchanging equation 3 was applied to determine the flow direction angle relative to a predetermined channel on the probe the test series demonstrated that the probe was generally able to predict flow direction correctly to within about 15 while still accurately quantifying the flux performance is comparable to the 15 reported by osorno et al 2018 for the probe in porous media table 1 fig 9 however it was noted that when flow was aligned with the probe channels so that water could take a straight path through the probe within 10 the estimated flow directions exhibited a slightly greater uncertainty estimated to be 20 4 conclusions this work was conducted to determine if the iwpvp could function usefully in a fractured media setting the medium tested was an extreme case of such a setting one with a single fracture intersecting a borehole instrumented with the iwpvp the linear calibrations of the instrument in two different aperture fractures leads to the conclusion that the iwpvp is a viable tool for characterizing flow in these settings it is expected that in more highly fractured settings flow through the probe will be less discrete and overall performance will only improve this expectation remains for future testing and field trials on the basis of close agreement between calculated and experimental testing results it is concluded that the ffa established near ideal conditions representative of a single fracture conducting water flow laboratory testing of the iwpvp demonstrated that the best probe performance was achieved when small volumes of tracer were delivered to the center of the probe s mixing chamber a modified injection system enhanced iwpvp performance for both saline and deionized water tracers it is further concluded from this work that the iwpvp performs well for the quantification of horizontal water flux through single horizontal fractures the flux measured within the probe responds linearly to flow in surrounding fractures up to about qf 80 m d moreover under idealized conditions the probe is capable of quantifying flow directions within about 20 this level of confidence in flow directions may not be achievable in all field settings but assuming good hydraulic connections between the fractures and the borehole containing the probe flow directions should be distinguishable at least between quadrants as indicated by tracer transport out of probe i e 45 note that these measurements are highly localized so even with this degree of uncertainty on the flow direction the data may be quite useful especially when combined with other localized measurements in order to gain an understanding of larger scale trends it is also concluded that if the capture width of a borehole intersecting a fracture can be estimated reasonably and if it may be considered invariant or minimally variable over a testing period then the iwpvp response will vary linearly with the fracture aperture assuming a simple horizontal isolated fracture conversely if fracture apertures are known from other independent sources e g hydraulic tests or borehole logs then a measured flux in the probe can be used to estimate water flux in an intersecting fracture given the linear responses reported above and the linear responses of the iwpvp in porous media applications as demonstrated by osorno et al 2018 it is expected that the iwpvp will also respond linearly where dense fracture sets intersect a borehole additional testing is needed to verify that similar responses are associated with intermediate fracture densities or non horizontal fracture orientations in addition this work demonstrates the viability of the iwpvp as a tool for characterizing fractured media it provides a fast small scale measurement of flux while exerting virtually no perturbation on the existing flow in combination with other methods capable of surveying entire boreholes for locations of likely active fractures this tool promises to serve in a complementary fashion for obtaining accurate localized measurements of water movement in fractured rock in an economical fashion future work will involve field deployment of the tool at a fractured rock site and investigation into methods to estimate calibration factors in a field setting in addition further work will be conducted to better establish the lower end of the calibration ranges and the instrument s flux detection limit in various fracture settings credit authorship contribution statement b r heyer conceptualization

4316,in rural settings groundwater is often the most utilised freshwater resource and can be subject to a number of factors that impact its availability and distribution river seepage plays an important role in recharging alluvial groundwater systems especially for arid environments where ephemeral rivers dominate in this study a river seepage component was developed for a spatially distributed rainfall runoff model the j2000 model to represent river seepage physical channel properties such as channel width slope length as well as a lumped riverbed hydraulic conductivity under dry and wet conditions were used to facilitate and account for enhanced evapotranspiration in the alluvial channel seepage firstly satisfied the potential evaporation demand and thereafter contributed to simulated recharge the results show that by accounting for seepage observed low flows were well simulated log e2 0 74 although the input precipitation data and quality of the measured precipitation was associated with a high uncertainty and further impacted by a change in station density between the headwater and valley region 3 times higher in the headwaters as a result peak flows were less well represented e2 0 39 and a second downstream calibration was not possible on average river reach seepage was estimated to be 8 mm d 1 where 150 300 mm yr 1 of seepage was simulated during wet years exceeding simulated percolation on a reach level and a significant source over the catchment area given streamflow only comprised 1 3 of the total water balance the efficiencies attained by this approach were good considering the extremely harsh climatic conditions this approach is likely transferable to other arid environments and rivers with intermittent flow where river seepage may be overlooked as an important contributor to hydrological functioning keywords river seepage rainfall runoff modelling distributed j2000 model arid environments 1 introduction in arid environments surface and groundwater systems are periodically connected when sufficient rainfall results in channel flow since these climate conditions give rise to non perennial or ephemeral rivers aquifers are usually located near or in dry river beds ephemeral river beds are usually characterised by coarse grained sand where the deposition of alluvial sediments downstream and widening of river channels results in more transmission losses towards the catchment outlet morin et al 2009 while the texture of river bed materials may vary between upstream and downstream segments low antecedent moisture has a major influence on the rate of channel loss sorman and abdulrazzak 1993 lange 2005 for this reason the amount of water stored in alluvial aquifers as shallow groundwater is dependent on a range of environmental and climatic conditions leading to complex interactions between surface and groundwater systems since the rate of transmission loss is an important parameter for estimating groundwater recharge in arid environments sharma and murthy 1994 dahan et al 2007 wheater et al 2008 shanafield and cook 2014 methods that consider surface groundwater interactions are required for estimating recharge for alluvial aquifers critical hydrological processes in which surface and groundwater systems are interconnected can be simulated using rainfall runoff models li et al 2016 deb et al 2019 these models using hydrological process variables partition incoming water into different hydrological flow components that impact the simulated rate of streamflow transmission the level of spatial complexity of rainfall runoff models can be classified into three categories namely lumped semi distributed and fully distributed variants beven and binley 1992 deb and kiem 2020 in lumped rainfall runoff models factors that impact runoff generation are aggregated for an entire catchment meaning that a bulk response of the catchment is simulated clarke 1973 tran et al 2018 while lumped models have been used across of range of different climatic and environmental settings hughes 2013 in mountainous catchments with significant differences in topography and geology important spatial

streamflow and extreme flash flood events sporadically generated by high intensity precipitation mason et al 1999 batisani and yarnal 2010 between the coastline of cape town in south africa and the border between namibia and angola 1500 km there are twenty one rivers indicated but only four perennial rivers berg olifants orange and kunene with the remainder being ephemeral while evaporation and evapotranspiration dominate the daily water balance of arid environments mountainous regions still generate runoff in the form of quick flow which has resulted in considerable damage to civil infrastructure mul et al 2008 as extreme precipitation events are often interpreted as the dominant groundwater recharge mechanism taylor et al 2013b groundwater recharge for arid southern africa is mainly associated with mountainous fractured rock aquifers where the bulk of precipitation is received however recharge for alluvial aquifers in arid environments can come in the form of transmission loss and seepage through river sediments as well as through regional groundwater flow from fractured rock aquifers given that limited knowledge is available regarding the role of river seepage in alluvial aquifer recharge especially for catchments between cape town and the namibian boarder additional information is required to understand the dominant recharge mechanism for these alluvial aquifer systems in this study a distributed j2000 rainfall runoff model was used to estimate the rate of river seepage for the groen river catchment in namaqualand south africa namaqualand on the northern west coast of south africa supports the highly threatened and rich biodiversity of succulent shrublands van wyk and smith 2001 luther mosebach et al 2012 where changes in species diversity emphasize important differences in hydrology across the landscape while evaporation demand is extremely high in arid environments focal points of wet conditions do exist and drive groundwater recharge as well as other dominant hydrological processes as more uncertainty is associated with hydrological modelling in data scarce environments model calibration was applied for a sub basin where climate and precipitation station density were sufficient to evaluate this approach and understand how transferable it is for other mountainous regions in arid settings the conceptual representation of alluvial aquifer recharge was compared with groundwater residence times and dating for the adjacent buffels river catchment as the effects of climate change have begun to take effect around the world with severe water shortages to many west coast cities and towns of southern africa it is important to constrain future water security concerns understanding how precipitation events influence the renewal rate of groundwater systems in arid environments is important in developing effective adaption strategies as well as benefitting from an increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation events which drives river seepage 2 environmental setting both the groen and the buffels river catchments are located in the namaqualand region of the northern cape province of south africa fig 1 a b the groen catchment is geographically important due to the position of two gauging structures within the basin while the buffels river is more significant in size as well as population garies is the major town situated in the northern part of the groen catchment for the buffels river catchment the major urban centres are the regional town of springbok in the centre of the catchment and the smaller towns of kamieskroon in the south and kleinzee an old mining town on the west coast fig 1c a topographic divide at the peak of the kamies mountains forms the border of the south draining groen catchment as well as the north draining buffels river catchment fig 1c the groen catchment area is 4 715 km2 in size while buffels river is 9 870 km2 and together they make up around half of the namaqualand area 30 560 km2 comprising the majority of namaqualand above 700 m a s l meters above sea level streamflow measurements in the groen catchment exist in the catchment headwater sub basin size 234 km2 and on the swart doring river sub basin size 2 350 km2 which is towards the confluence of these two ephemeral rivers fig 1c and d climate and precipitation stations are spatially distributed across the catchments but in general more stations exist for regions of higher elevation fig 1b 500 m a s l 2 1 climate namaqualand is mainly a semi arid to arid environment with a mediterranean climate as precipitation is received in the winter months of the year the mean annual precipitation map for the region is spatially variable with around 366 mm yr 1 at rooiberg reducing to 80 mm yr 1 towards the outlets of the groen and buffels river catchments fig 1d and table 1 lynch 2004 map for the towns of springbok and kamieskroon is 204 and 230 mm yr 1 respectively map for the town of garies is 150 mm yr 1 while kleinsee on the coast receives on average 77 mm yr 1 with conditions predominately more hyper arid moving up the coastline to namibia over the 100 years of records collected at springbok by the south african weather service saws yearly precipitation rates are variable fig 2 on average 33 wet days per year are received at springbok and the average precipitation event size is 6 5 mm d 1 during particularly wet years map 204 mm average daily precipitation events were between 14 and 19 mm d 1 more recent climatic conditions suggest a lower average daily precipitation event size from 1980 to 1998 fig 2 fog is also a significant contributor to the coastal parts of namaqualand with around 75 days of fog per annum davis et al 2016 although more information is still required to understand whether this plays a role in the catchment water balance the average daily temperatures in the region are often in excess of 35 c in summer with an average daily potential evaporation rate of between 7 and 11 mm d 1 for springbok schulze et al 2007 in winter the daily average temperature is 17 c although night time temperatures reach sub zero degrees and potential evaporation rates are between 3 and 6 mm d 1 for springbok schulze et al 2007 the yearly potential evaporation rate for springbok is 2465 mm schulze et al 2007 which greatly exceeds map lynch 2004 by a factor of 12 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the geology of the groen and buffels river catchments are dominated by the mesoproterozoic granitic gneisses of the little namaqualand suite and the spektakel suite which are part of the bushmanland subprovince bsp macey et al 2018 the little namaqualand suite is comprised of deformed ortho gneisses which includes biotite bearing granitic augen gneisses with strongly recrystalised k feldspar while plutons of concordia granites are prevalent in the buffels river bodies of lekkerdrink gneiss for which the parent material is a generic quartzo felspathic igneous protolith are more prevalent in the groen river catchment macey et al 2011 2018 the coastal plains of the groen and buffels river are comprised of recent aeolian sedimentary deposits groundwater in namaqualand is associated with two main aquifer types 1 primary porosity alluvial aquifers and 2 secondary porosity fractured rock aquifers fig 3 the shallow alluvial aquifers are present throughout the catchment river valley although the alluvial systems become disconnected from each other by irregular surfaces of the underlying basement gneisses benito et al 2011b this means that there are only two alluvial systems thought to be significant aquifers the spektakel and kleinsee aquifers both existing in low lying coastal plains fig 3 the alluvial aquifers are considered to be between 4 and 20 m thick approximately 15 km long and are the main water source for the towns of buffels river and kleinsee benito et al 2011b these aquifers are interlinked with the much deeper fractured bedrock aquifer via a weathering zone unconformity which provides a pathway and conduit for groundwater flow from the deeper granitic gneissic and bedrock aquifers benito et al 2011b van gend et al 2021 while little information is available regarding the significance of the secondary aquifer the granitic and gneissic host rocks are associated with low primary porosity and groundwater is hosted by fractures and joint planes although the effective porosity is variable as these fractures are not always interconnected therefore the granitic and gneissic host rocks are associated with a very low hydraulic conductivity compared with the alluvial aquifer systems 2 3 vegetation and land use the study catchments fall within the namaqualand hardeveld kamiesberg and namaqualand sandveld cape floristic region the dominant vegetation types for the hardeveld bioregion part of the succulent karoo biome are the highly endemic succulent dwarf shrubs schmiedel and oldeland 2018 the kamiesberg is defined as the succulent karoo biome above 1200 m a s l van wyk and smith 2001 comprising the kamiesberg granite fynbos namaqualand granite renosterveld namaqualand klipkoppe shrubland and the kamiesberg mountain shrubland the namaqualand sandveld comprises of the coastal vegetation of the succulent karoo biome covering the northern cape as well as the northern parts of the western cape acocks 1988 cowling et al 1999 these plant species have adapted to low precipitation conditions and are mainly dependent on fog as a source of moisture the differences in vegetation types across namaqualand signify changes in climatic and soil conditions and impact interception infiltration as well as other important hydrological processes 3 materials and methods the j2000 rainfall runoff model krause 2001 together with the modular object oriented system jams kralisch and krause 2006 was used to simulate the hydrological processes of the groen catchment fig 4 the j2000 uses hrus flügel 1995 as spatial entities of homogeneous topology hydrogeology land use and soil paired with a topological routing scheme to simulate flow dynamics at the hillslope scale pfennig et al 2009 the input data required for the j2000 model hru delineation reach routing which contains the deep sink component model calibration and validation are outlined below detailed procedures for the hru delineation as well as soil hydrogeology and land use parameterization are provided in watson et al 2020 2019 2018 additionally detail regarding the simulated hydrological processes of the j2000 model are provided in nepal et al 2019 as this contribution focuses on modifications to the model reach routing 3 1 model inputs 3 1 1 climate and rainfall daily precipitation and climatic data were obtained directly from saws and through the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa platform for the periods 1988 01 01 to 1999 12 31 to align with gauging records section 3 1 2 united states national oceanic and atmospheric administration national climatic data center 2016 in addition daily precipitation within 100 km of the town of garies was extracted from the daily rainfall utility software kunz 2004 which contains an archive of daily precipitation station data originally used to developed the map layer for south africa lynch 2004 of the precipitation data used a high density of measurements exists in the headwaters of the groen as well as near the confluence of the swart doring and groen rivers fig 1c and d additional stations from further inland but still within namaqualand were included to improve the precipitation regionalisation fig 1b climate data which includes air temperature min mean and max windspeed 2 m above ground surface as well as dew point were obtained from three stations in namaqualand fig 1c sunshine duration was obtained from saws stations in the berg river watson et al 2020 which is 300 km away but as soil moisture is the limiting factor for simulated actual evapotranspiration et demand soil moisture it has limited impact on the model results standardized calculations according to allen et al 1998 and penman monteith were used to calculate relative humidity using dew point and tmean and solar radiation sunshine duration that thereafter form the input for potential evapotranspiration calculations within the model 3 1 2 streamflow two gauging structures are located within the groen catchment to monitor streamflow which are both managed and maintained by the department of water and sanitation dws 2020 10 10 fig 1c the data was attained from the dws portal and grdc global runoff data centre 1999 the leliefontein gauge dwa id f5h002 is located in the headwater of the groen and is fed by the kamies mountains the bruintjieshoogte gauge dwa id f5h001 is located on the swart doring river towards the confluence of the swart doring and groen rivers for the model calibration data was used from 1990 to 2000 with an emphasis on the floods of 1996 and 1997 as understanding the losses that occur during high flows is important for alluvial aquifer recharge benito et al 2011a 3 1 3 hydrogeology a 1 250 000 geological map obtained from the council of geosciences macey et al 2011 along with aquifer properties from literature domenico and schwartz 1990 tankard et al 2012 was used to determine the hydrogeological inputs for the j2000 model fig 3 in addition the geological map was used to determine which reach segments experience seepage and require the use of the deep sink component fig 5 since there is limited data on aquifer properties for the groen catchment bulk literature values domenico and schwartz 1990 as well as recent j2000 model parameters from other catchments in the western cape were used bugan 2014 treumer 2016 watson et al 2018 2019 2020 the information transferred includes storage capacity storage coefficient maximum aquifer thickness and recession coefficients for the upper and lower aquifers in this regard the upper primary aquifer is comprised of the alluvial sediments while the lower secondary aquifer is made up of granitic and gneissic formations 3 1 4 soils the j2000 uses two soil pore storages namely middle pore storage mps 0 2 50 µm and large pore storage lps 50 µm as the input soil data the harmonized world soil database hwsd version 1 2 batjes et al 2012 and rosetta lite pedotransfer within the hydrus model šimůnek et al 2006 were used to estimate these inputs hwsd is a 30 arc second raster database and has been used in previous jams j2000 models in southern africa watson et al 2018 2019 2020 the textural characteristics sand silt and clay ssc within the hwsd was used to estimate the wilting point 15 000 mbar and to generate soil hydraulic properties of theta vs depth using a constant upper and lower head boundary to calculate mps the field capacity of the soil water holding capacities at 15000 and 60 mbar were used to estimate the amount of water held against gravity or the amount of lps the water holding capacities between 0 mbar and 60 mbar were subtracted finally the total water holding capacity of mps and lps was determined by multiplication with the respective soil horizon depths given that limited soil observations were available in the study region as well as uncertainty with the derived mps and lps using hwsd a lumped parameter scaling factor fc adaption mps and ac adaption lps were used to scale the field capacity fc and air capacity ac within the soil dataset see 3 4 for model calibration 3 1 5 land use the j2000 model requires albedo monthly surface resistances assuming sufficient water supply leaf area index lai for vegetational growth periods effective vegetation heights for growth periods root depth and sealed grade value of area with impervious surface as the input land use data the spatial extent of the different land uses was determined using the 2013 2014 south african national land cover dataset geoterraimage and together with literature information johnson 1983 van 1984 crain 1998 amer and hatfield 2004 munitz et al 2017 was used to derive the input land use data 3 2 hydrological response unit delineation the web based grass hru delineation tool schwartze 2008 was used to determine the hrus for the groen catchment its delineation procedure combines gauging structure locations 2 gauges a digital elevation model dem shuttle radar topography mission srtm 90 m and maps of land use geology and soils to create sets of the hrus and river reaches that represent the spatial modelling units in a first step a sink filling approach is applied on the dem followed by the calculation of different dem derivates including slope aspect and flow accumulation directions in a second step the latter are used to delineate the stream network and related sub basins using a threshold for the minimum sub basin size to determine the level of stream delineation detail in a third step an overlay analysis combines slope aspect elevation delineated sub basins and maps of land use soil and geology a minimum size threshold is used to remove sliver polygons size 14 cells or 0 19 km2 for the catchment during a fourth step the flow accumulation map is used to generate the flow routing network that connects the hrus with one another and to the reach segments a similar routing scheme is calculated for the reach segments allowing for water transport through the channel network finally the hru statistics including area elevation slope aspect watershed sub basin land use geology soil and topological neighbours hru reach were generated for each hru for reaches statistics about slope length width and downstream neighbour were calculated the minimum threshold for the sub basin and hru size is determined by a manual iterative procedure to ensure a good level of model detail as well as keeping run times to a realistic level 3 3 reach processes the reach based simulation in the model considers three main processes i e i water routing between adjacent reach segments ii seepage of water from the river channel and iii evapotranspiration of water from the alluvial riverbed 3 3 1 routing the flow routing in the model is based on individual reach segments that are connected according to the flow topology in the region the calculation of runoff q from a single reach follows the kinematic wave approach in which the outflow is a function of the available water volume v and a retention coefficient rk according to 1 q v e 1 rk this retention coefficient rk depends on the flow velocity v in the reach segment the stream length fl and a reach routing calibration parameter ta 2 rk v fl t a 3600 the flow velocity in the reaches and therefore the delay between water entering the stream and its arrival at the outlet is calculated based on the manning strickler equation krause 2002 this approach uses the manning roughness coefficient m slope of the river bed i and hydraulic radius rh to calculate flow velocity v as 3 v m rh 2 3 i 1 2 while m and i are static attributes of the reach segment rh is calculated based on the cross section area a in which the water is flowing through and reach width b as 4 rh a b 2 a b here the cross section area a is a function of the available water volume v and the flow velocity v 5 a v v while the approach described above allows calculating the overall runoff q from a single reach q is further subdivided into four flow components i e surface runoff q r d 1 interflow q r d 2 upper groundwater flow q r g 1 and lower groundwater flow q r g 2 this separation is done based on the proportions of these components in the initial water volume v that has accumulated in the current time step 3 3 2 seepage for reach segments where the seepage is to be applied fig 5 the calculated runoff q eqs 1 5 is further adapted before reach routing first a leakage area l area is determined as 5 l area rh 2 f l taking the calculated runoff q from the reach into account this seepage volume deepsink w is then calculated as 6 deepsink w min l area k sink sink α q where k sink is the hydraulic conductivity for the riverbed m d and sink α is a scaling parameter used to adjust k sink as part of the model calibration section 3 4 the deepsink volume is finally removed from the calculated runoff q 7 q q deepsink w in order to consider different hydraulic conductivities under wet and dry conditions of the river channel each reach segment comprises two distinct k sink values i e k sink wet and k sink dry during seepage simulation the model will switch automatically between those two values depending on whether the water level in the reach falls below a defined threshold k sink k sink dry or not k sink k sink wet after deepsink w was calculated it is split into two components the first component deepsink gw represents the leaked water which contributes to the model s groundwater storage the second component deepsink sw represents the remaining water volume that contributes to the soil water storage of the related alluvial river bed while deepsink gw is considered to be permanently stored in the aquifer deepsink sw will be subject to an evapotranspiration process in the river floodplain therefore both components will not contribute to the outflow from the basin 3 3 3 evapotranspiration in alluvial bed the water volume deepsink sw redirected to the soil water storage of the alluvial river bed is input to the lumped soil water simulation of the jams j2k model in order to simulate the actual evapotranspiration from this storage a potential evapotranspiration based on the penman monteith approach is calculated according to the standard pet calculation in the model allen et al 1998 for this purpose landuse and soil parameters are defined for each river segment 3 4 model calibration for the model calibration a fully automated non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii deb et al 2002 was used the lower and upper bounds range for the calibrated parameters was set using previous expert knowledge of plausible j2000 model parameters table 2 the calibration was performed from 1990 to 1999 with a two year warm up period 1998 1990 during which streamflow and precipitation records overlapped to evaluate the performance of the calibration procedure various efficiency criteria were selected that focused on different aspects of the simulated hydrograph the kling gupta efficiency kge was selected as the dominant efficiency criteria due to its general ability to assess the correlation bias and the variability of simulated and observed streamflow gupta et al 2009 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash 1970 in standard squared form e2 was also selected due to its ability to assess hydrological model performance overall because e2 typically over represents peak flows the logarithmic form of the nse loge2 was used to assess the simulated low flows nash sutcliffe efficiency as unsquared residuals e1 and the log of unsquared residuals loge1 were used to supplement the selected efficiency criteria finally bias was used to quantify the overall estimation error 3 5 sensitivity analysis to understand the relative importance of different calibration parameters and related hydrological processes a regional sensitivity analysis rsa was used hornberger and spear 1981 as part of the rsa more commonly called monte carlo analysis mca model parameters were split into behavioural good and non behavioural bad populations pianosi et al 2016 using the kge model efficiency using this approach the calibrated value of each parameter p was randomly increased decreased by up to 10 i e values where sampled from the interval 0 9 p cal 1 1 p cal where p cal was the calibrated value of p for each sample the simulated runoff was analysed by means of the kge efficiency criteria to assess the overall parameter sensitivity the model variables involved in the mca include ac adaptation fc adaptation a rain soilconcrd2 soilmaxinfwinter soilmaxperc flowrouteta sink a and drythreshold table 1 4 results the j2000 model was used to simulate the hydrological behaviour of the groen river considering the impact that seepage has on catchment streamflow before the simulated seepage is presented an evaluation is required of the regionalised precipitation and the station density difference between the upstream and downstream sub basins in the delineation an average sub basin and hru size of 12 15 km2 and 0 3 km2 was generated respectively where in total 14534 hrus were used by the model while the data availability climate land use soil and hydrogeology would not warrant a detailed hru delineation the distance between the hrus and the nearest climate station impacts the selection of the respected streamflow gauges the station density and the overall difference in elevation between the hrus and the precipitation stations impacts the regionalised precipitation as there is an average elevation difference between the upstream 798 m a s l and downstream sub basin 710 m a s l a comparison is be made between high and low altitude stations thereafter the observed and simulated streamflow is outlined finally the percentage seepage for the reaches in the catchment as well as the two different sub basins are presented 4 1 observed precipitation analysis of the observed precipitation is aggregated into upstream high altitude stations 700 m a s l which includes karkams and kamieskroon and downstream low altitude stations 400 m a s l which includes rietpoort and nuwerus fig 6 these locations also correspond to the closest precipitation stations for each modelled sub basin and therefore receive a high regionalised weight while karkams and nuwerus have no observed data for 1990 and data was only available for these stations after 1991 03 01 kamieskroon and rietpoort have data available prior to 1990 in the following analysis wet years were considered to be years where precipitation exceeded map while dry years precipitation was less than map precipitation for the stations was mainly received between mid may to late july following a winter precipitation pattern fig 7 b the map observed for karkams and kamieskroon was 341 and 298 mm table 3 wet years include 1996 and 1997 where in excess of 450 mm was measured at karkams and 380 mm at kamieskroon respectively fig 7a and table 3 5 mm in 1997 05 25 was recorded for karkams while 73 mm was recorded at kamieskroon for the same day other large events of 55 5 47 5 and 43 mm were recorded at karkams during 1993 1994 and 1996 fig 6 at kamieskroon depths of 48 48 46 mm were recorded in 1990 1995 and 1994 fig 6 the map for rietpoort and nuwerus was 142 7 and 179 3 mm respectively table 3 wet years at rietpoort include 1996 and 1997 while at nuwerus 1997 and 1995 were the wettest with in excess of 200 mm being recorded fig 7a and table 3 on average the daily precipitation event size was 6 mm for rietpoort std 2 0 mm and 5 mm at nuwerus std 2 4 mm the maximum daily precipitation at rietpoort was 49 5 mm in 1994 06 29 while 69 mm was recorded at nuwerus on 1997 05 25 table 3 other large events of 26 20 5 and 20 mm were recorded at rietpoort in 1993 1991 and 1999 fig 6 at nuwerus higher than average daily depths of 42 5 24 5 and 22 mm of precipitation were recorded in 1993 1994 and 1995 4 2 regionalised precipitation the average distance between the hrus and the precipitation stations for the upstream groen sub basin was 8 km while for the downstream swart doring it was 27 3 km fig 8 a and ai the average difference in elevation between the hrus and the precipitation stations for the upstream groen sub basin was 180 m while for swart doring it was 214 m fig 8b and bi the regionalised map for the upstream groen sub basin was 306 5 mm compared with 341 and 298 observed at karkams and kamieskroon table 4 for the swart doring the regionalised map was 184 7 mm compared with 142 7 and 179 3 observed at rietpoort and nuwerus table 3 wet years for groen include 1995 1996 and 1997 with 380 mm while for swart doring 1993 1995 and 1996 yielded 200 mm the average regionalised precipitation event size was 5 2 mm for groen and 2 5 mm for swart doring table 4 the maximum regionalised precipitation event size was 65 1 mm for groen and 31 3 for swart doring other large events include 45 39 and 32 mm for groen during 1993 1994 and 1996 for swart doring events of 20 7 20 9 and 19 6 were regionalised during 1994 1997 and 1998 4 3 observed streamflow while the j2000 operates on a daily timestep and both inputs and outputs have a daily resolution observed and simulated streamflow is rather presented as both daily fig 9 a and monthly data fig 9b to assess the model s ability to represent catchment seasonal variations the maximum observed streamflow for the groen gauge was 17 24 m3 s 1 on 1996 08 27 with another significant event of 15 38 m3 s 1 on 1997 06 28 fig 9a for the other monitoring years 1990 1991 1993 1994 and 1995 a maximum streamflow of 1 8 m3 s 1 was measured peak flow was mainly prevalent from april to october each year and generally 0 25 m3 s the maximum streamflow for the swart doring gauge was 15 0 m3 s on 1997 06 29 with 13 7 m3 s on the following day supp fig 1 for the years 1990 1991 1993 and 1994 a maximum of 0 57 m3 s was observed similar to groen observed streamflow was more prevalent between april to october with 90 of the observed runoff 4 4 simulated streamflow the performance of the j2000 model was assessed visually as well as using the various selected performance evaluation criteria as the distance between the hrus and the nearest climate station for swart doring was nearly double that of the groen and considerably less precipitation was received for lower altitudes the station density was deemed insufficient for a calibration at the downstream gauge swart doring below the daily exceedance probability for the measured and simulated streamflow is presented for the groen river with a focus on specific peak flows as this has more impact on the amount of seepage the extreme climatic conditions of the catchment meant that a low efficiency performance was expected where streamflow for the groen only comprised 6 1 3 if seepage is included of the total water balance for the headwaters supp fig 2 in general considering the availability of climate data the model was able to simulate the observed streamflow well for the groen sub basin which is underlined by a bias of 0 13 fig 9 the simulation of catchment low flows was well represented with a loge2 of 0 74 where the model simulated 0 002 m3 s for the 30th percentile as opposed to 0 m3 s observed the model performed worse at representing peak flow with the 1 exceedance probability of 1 28 m3 s for simulated and 0 82 m3 s for observed streamflow although an e2 of 0 38 was less satisfactory than the other efficiencies it was mainly linked to a single large event that was not simulated by the model or not fully measured by the climate stations the event of 1996 08 27 where 17 24 m3 s was observed as streamflow and three days prior precipitation amounted to 81 mm was simulated as 0 45 m3 s by the model and the dominant cause of the low e2 performance the event in 1997 06 28 of 15 37 m3 s 1 which was simulated as 8 23 m3 s 1 was better represented with five days prior precipitation of 104 mm 4 5 simulated seepage the simulated seepage is a function of a number of reach variables which include the area slope dry and wet hydraulic conductivity and distribution of alluvial to bedrock seepage the optimized seepage rate was estimated to be 56 m d 1 for the entire basin which was the most realistic parameter combination and a compromise between simulation of peak and low flows refer to section 5 3 as a second calibration was not possible for the much larger and downstream swart doring sub basin the estimated seepage rate for the entire basin using the upstream calibration remains very uncertain as a means to conceptualise the possible effects of river seepage these results will still be presented in the headwater parts of the groen and swart doring reaches with a high percentage seepage 0 4 0 7 were characterised as long segments 8000 m seldom with a width 5 m fig 10 c as headwater reaches are often steep 2 5 seepage was limited due to the high average flow velocity fig 10c high percentage loss 2 for reaches in the swart doring and groen valley were characterised by moderate slope 1 5 and long reach length 8000 m fig 10a c closest to the swart doring gauge low reach slope 0 7 results in a high percentage seepage 85 fig 10c d towards the catchment outlet and representing the low valley portion of the groen catchment reach width 15 m and slope 0 7 lead to a high percentage seepage 2 3 4 4 fig 10a c 4 6 model parameter sensitivity parameters which were deemed insensitive where a distinction between best group and worst group was very small straight line were excluded from the sensitivity analysis results this meant that only nine parameters were analysed with their sensitivities being distinctly different table 1 and supp fig 3 the sensitivity analysis showed three groups these include low moderate and high sensitivity which were essentially controlled by the deviations between the worst and best model groups fig 11 parameters regarded as low sensitivity include soilmaxinfwinter maximum infiltration rate for winter soilmaxperc leaching of water to groundwater storage and drythreshold reach water level value used to switch between kwet and kdry parameters regarded as moderate sensitivity were fc adaptation scaling factor for lps a rain vegetation interception volume soilconcrd2 surface runoff delay parameter and sink a multiplier to scale hydraulic conductivity of river beds the only parameter regarded as highly sensitive was fc adaptation scaling factor for mps 5 discussion the aim of this study was to integrate a river seepage component into the j2000 rainfall runoff model that could be applied in arid and semi arid environments to test the effectiveness of the new component seepage was determined for the groen river catchment south africa the model regionalisation results showed distinct differences in the density of precipitation stations for the upstream and downstream sub basins and therefore the potential impact on the modelling results needs to first be considered as seepage forms a mechanism of recharge to alluvial aquifer systems the results of this study will be compared with other recharge estimation methods this is illustrated through translation of the approach to the buffels river catchment to the immediate north the buffels river catchment has similar climatic environmental and hydrogeological conditions and due to its larger population it has been the focus of recent work on groundwater quality and residence time van rooyen and miller submitted van gend et al 2021 but as previously stated has no active gauging structures finally the effectiveness of the calibration procedure is discussed highlighting the uncertainty of the optimized parameters the seepage component has been developed with the aim to be used in data scarce regions although as it is a conceptual approach its physical representation of river seepage needs to be evaluated 5 1 effect of station density on modelling results the importance of good precipitation data for hydrological modelling purposes cannot be overstated and this has been recognised by many studies borga and vizzaccaro 1997 campling et al 2001 spadavecchia and williams 2009 huang et al 2019 watson et al 2020 one of the most significant problems with undertaking hydrological modelling in sub saharan africa is the variation in climate station density that impacts regionalisation of precipitation records this issue becomes more pronounced when utilising two or more gauges for model calibration and validation in this study two major sub basins were considered the groen and the larger swart doring while recommended station densities for modelling purposes are largely unknown for arid southern africa modelling results for the semi arid berg river show a high performance e2 0 81 loge2 0 84 in regions with an average hru to station distance of 12 km watson et al 2020 considering this the groen sub basin was well within this range 8 km but swart doring was twice 27 3 km these suggested values and therefore not recommended for this model calibration fig 8ai bi as a result model uncertainty for the entire basin was high given the uncertainty of both the optimised parameter set as well as the input climate data furthermore limitations in the number of peak flow events the size of the calibrated catchment as well as the number of reaches in the sub basin groen impacts the tangible conclusions made about river seepage for the region 5 2 river seepage as source of recharge previous research in the area has suggested that seepage is not significant and on average only once every 5 10 years is recharge generated from floodwater benito et al 2011b the results of this study confirm this as during wet years more than five times more seepage is routed to the alluvial aquifer than during dry years fig 12 small events which were more frequent were mostly evaporated transpired via the alluvial bed and do not contribute to deeper groundwater stores supp fig 4 events such as 1996 09 17 recorded by the swart doring gauge as 8 8 m3 s 1 and 1997 06 29 of 14 m3 s 1 were estimated to surpass the bed evaporation demand as well as the seepage rate with streamflow observed at the downstream gauge the frequency and occurrence of years of significant recharge is however considered to be more regular than suggested by benito et al 2011b and would seem from this limited data to be every two years fig 9 years where three to four events of 50 mm d 1 and the number of precipitation events exceeds a depth threshold of 300 mm have been estimated to be significant the seepage of the catchment varies greatly across the different reaches but in general for the catchment valley with gentle slopes between 150 and 300 mm yr 1 of water was routed via seepage to the alluvial aquifer fig 12 while additional information is needed to constrain the simulation of percolation e g watson et al 2018 the simulated seepage rate exceeds a maximum of 5 to 30 mm yr 1 of percolation for the hrus across the catchment area simulated percolation exceeds that of seepage as well as the rate of alluvial bed evapotranspiration fig 13 the comparison between percolation and seepage illustrates the importance of floodwater in recharging the alluvial aquifer system confirming the presence of extensive aquifers beneath and in river bed materials typically shallow boreholes taping into alluvial aquifers are assumed to contain young or modern groundwater that is directly linked to present day precipitation in the buffels river catchment residence time calculations based on mixing relationships between 14c and 3h radio isotope tracers indicate a mix of ages between a modern end member to a holocene or older en member component 12 700 years van gend et al 2021 van rooyen 2021 these mixing relationships are strong support for continual seepage from the river channel contributing smaller but constant recharge to the alluvial system leading to a spectrum of groundwater residence times as the local community and municipality in namaqualand is reliant on the alluvial aquifer as a major source of water changes in precipitation patterns which impact river quick flow can have severe impacts on the availability of groundwater in the future climate change projections for namaqualand suggest more variability in daily temperatures although no consensus is available regarding the frequency and intensity of precipitation taylor et al 2013a davis et al 2016 future changes in both temperature as well as precipitation can have significant impacts on catchment hydrological response which can impact both the quality as well as the quantity of groundwater available to the local residence of namaqualand 5 3 seepage simulation in hydrological modelling in humid and tropical environments model uncertainties generally decrease with an increase in catchment area and precipitation input signal to noise ratio xue et al 2013 the reason for this is that general reach routing approaches such as the kinematic wave equation accumulate flow along the reach network the opposite occurs when considering river seepage where water is lost upon transmission and evapotranspiration from the alluvial bed in this study the calibration was applied for a small sub basin comprising only 5 of the total area the addition of a sink a as well as drythreshold parameter meant that the model was capable of simulating catchment low flows log e2 0 74 with lower parameter values yielding only slight improvements for peak flow simulation in general majority of the nsga ii solutions yielded high sink a as well as high drythreshold values supp fig 3 the selection of the best solution considered the upper and lower limits of the parameter bounds as the nsga ii optimiser tended to go past realistic parameter values this was more common for parameters of low sensitivity but also occurred for the seepage parameters of sink a and drythreshold while the mca showed which parameter values are sensitive and carry a higher uncertainty for the upstream location fig 11 downstream it is presumed that parameter sensitivities would be different in addition to potential differences in hydrological processes and runoff behaviour between headwater and valley regions the seepage functions are suggested to become more sensitive downstream for arid conditions the resultant effect of the automatic directed calibration using nsga ii was that the model parameters focused on reducing evapotranspiration and baseflow to generate more quick flow in the form of interflow and overland flow while the selected parameters for the model are explainable for the region where flash flood events exist with high magnitudes especially in catchment headwaters high uncertainty remains in applying these parameters for the entire catchment as groundwater recharge is heterogeneous in nature distributed rainfall runoff models include the necessary variables to simulate both spatial and temporal differences in recharge different recharge mechanisms such as river seepage can be represented but require dense precipitation station networks as well as good measurements to constrain different model parameters and reduce uncertainty in precipitation inputs the daily temporal resolution of the rainfall runoff model is important in representing extreme precipitation events which drive alluvial aquifer recharge this seepage model has the potential to improve the physical representation of runoff generation in arid and semi arid environments using hydrological modelling systems where intermittent flow can significantly influence model representation 5 4 applicability of distributed modelling in arid environments understanding the rate of river seepage is a complex process as the mechanism can vary substantially for different landscapes and environments and measurements are time consuming and error prone in situations where river channels are connected to highly conductive basement aquifers the rate of seepage often only becomes significant for much larger events and for small to medium events seepage is minimal lange et al 1998 in such environments it is more common that only once a certain runoff threshold is exceeded does seepage become significant lange 2005 in situations where river channels are disconnected from the basement aquifer or the basement aquifer has a low hydraulic conductivity the rate of seepage is much larger for small events and decreases once the sink areas of the river channel become saturated knighton and nanson 1994 in this study a seepage model was developed for an environment where the basement aquifer is presumed to have a low hydraulic conductivity observations from the downstream swart doring gauge where discharge was often less than upstream suggest that the rate of seepage is high during days of consecutive precipitation and under wet conditions to improve the transferability of the river seepage model easily derivable reach variables similar to hughes 2019 were used to represent the alluvial evapotranspiration as well as seepage to the deeper aquifer using a wet and dry hydraulic conductivity large discharge events such as 1997 06 29 were poorly represented and an implementation of a varying rate dependant on channel flow volume could benefit model simulations for arid conditions due to high uncertainty in the climate data this was not further explored and remains a focus for future work on river seepage as the river channel and ecosystems linked with the river channel are important for understanding exchanges in the phreatic zone incorporating factors that impact transmission loss as well as river seepage are required for ecohydrological investigations 6 conclusion understanding dominant recharge mechanisms is important for protecting groundwater from over exploitation and contamination in arid environments of southern africa limited understanding is available regarding recharge dynamics due to climatic and biophysical data limitations while arid environments experience harsh climatic conditions there is still a presence of young groundwater indicating that recharge is actively occurring as the potential for evaporation far surpasses the amount of yearly precipitation the source of young groundwater can often be unknown in this study a seepage component was integrated into the j2000 rainfall runoff model in order to determine the rate of alluvial aquifer recharge which occurs during streamflow transmission the seepage component made use of a number of physical properties to firstly constrain the amount of alluvial evapotranspiration and thereafter facilitate river seepage under wet and dry channel conditions the approach was applied to the groen river a region where residents in the catchment and neighbouring catchments are particularly reliant on the alluvial aquifer system for water supply while the simulation of river seepage downstream was highly uncertain partly attributed to poor climatic data these results suggest that during wet years significant amounts of recharge occur on average 150 to 300 mm yr 1 with the channel slope being the largest physical property which controls simulated seepage during dry years significantly less seepage occurs 6 to 15 mm yr 1 where seepage can be equivalent to simulated percolation across the reach area the approach highlights the importance of extreme precipitation events for generating recharge to alluvial aquifers in arid environments which through seepage are actively recharged water sources the j2000 seepage component has the potential to improve the physical representation of hydrological behaviour in arid and semi arid environments where intermittent flow can significantly influence river transmission loss credit authorship contribution statement andrew watson conceptualization methodology software data

4316,in rural settings groundwater is often the most utilised freshwater resource and can be subject to a number of factors that impact its availability and distribution river seepage plays an important role in recharging alluvial groundwater systems especially for arid environments where ephemeral rivers dominate in this study a river seepage component was developed for a spatially distributed rainfall runoff model the j2000 model to represent river seepage physical channel properties such as channel width slope length as well as a lumped riverbed hydraulic conductivity under dry and wet conditions were used to facilitate and account for enhanced evapotranspiration in the alluvial channel seepage firstly satisfied the potential evaporation demand and thereafter contributed to simulated recharge the results show that by accounting for seepage observed low flows were well simulated log e2 0 74 although the input precipitation data and quality of the measured precipitation was associated with a high uncertainty and further impacted by a change in station density between the headwater and valley region 3 times higher in the headwaters as a result peak flows were less well represented e2 0 39 and a second downstream calibration was not possible on average river reach seepage was estimated to be 8 mm d 1 where 150 300 mm yr 1 of seepage was simulated during wet years exceeding simulated percolation on a reach level and a significant source over the catchment area given streamflow only comprised 1 3 of the total water balance the efficiencies attained by this approach were good considering the extremely harsh climatic conditions this approach is likely transferable to other arid environments and rivers with intermittent flow where river seepage may be overlooked as an important contributor to hydrological functioning keywords river seepage rainfall runoff modelling distributed j2000 model arid environments 1 introduction in arid environments surface and groundwater systems are periodically connected when sufficient rainfall results in channel flow since these climate conditions give rise to non perennial or ephemeral rivers aquifers are usually located near or in dry river beds ephemeral river beds are usually characterised by coarse grained sand where the deposition of alluvial sediments downstream and widening of river channels results in more transmission losses towards the catchment outlet morin et al 2009 while the texture of river bed materials may vary between upstream and downstream segments low antecedent moisture has a major influence on the rate of channel loss sorman and abdulrazzak 1993 lange 2005 for this reason the amount of water stored in alluvial aquifers as shallow groundwater is dependent on a range of environmental and climatic conditions leading to complex interactions between surface and groundwater systems since the rate of transmission loss is an important parameter for estimating groundwater recharge in arid environments sharma and murthy 1994 dahan et al 2007 wheater et al 2008 shanafield and cook 2014 methods that consider surface groundwater interactions are required for estimating recharge for alluvial aquifers critical hydrological processes in which surface and groundwater systems are interconnected can be simulated using rainfall runoff models li et al 2016 deb et al 2019 these models using hydrological process variables partition incoming water into different hydrological flow components that impact the simulated rate of streamflow transmission the level of spatial complexity of rainfall runoff models can be classified into three categories namely lumped semi distributed and fully distributed variants beven and binley 1992 deb and kiem 2020 in lumped rainfall runoff models factors that impact runoff generation are aggregated for an entire catchment meaning that a bulk response of the catchment is simulated clarke 1973 tran et al 2018 while lumped models have been used across of range of different climatic and environmental settings hughes 2013 in mountainous catchments with significant differences in topography and geology important spatial differences in recharge mechanisms may be neglected williams and singh 1995 scanlon et al 2002 kim et al 2008 watson et al 2019 in fully distributed and semi distributed models e g j2000 krause 2001 and swat arnold et al 1998 hydrological response units hrus are used as spatial entities of homogenous topology climatic soil hydrogeology and land use as distributed models operate on a spatially disaggregated scale considering spatial differences in geology amongst others various different recharge mechanisms may be incorporated distributed rainfall runoff models though do not explicitly simulate losing rivers and transmission loss without additional model development pilgrim et al 1988 in arid regions of southern africa river systems are nearly always ephemeral with intermittent streamflow and extreme flash flood events sporadically generated by high intensity precipitation mason et al 1999 batisani and yarnal 2010 between the coastline of cape town in south africa and the border between namibia and angola 1500 km there are twenty one rivers indicated but only four perennial rivers berg olifants orange and kunene with the remainder being ephemeral while evaporation and evapotranspiration dominate the daily water balance of arid environments mountainous regions still generate runoff in the form of quick flow which has resulted in considerable damage to civil infrastructure mul et al 2008 as extreme precipitation events are often interpreted as the dominant groundwater recharge mechanism taylor et al 2013b groundwater recharge for arid southern africa is mainly associated with mountainous fractured rock aquifers where the bulk of precipitation is received however recharge for alluvial aquifers in arid environments can come in the form of transmission loss and seepage through river sediments as well as through regional groundwater flow from fractured rock aquifers given that limited knowledge is available regarding the role of river seepage in alluvial aquifer recharge especially for catchments between cape town and the namibian boarder additional information is required to understand the dominant recharge mechanism for these alluvial aquifer systems in this study a distributed j2000 rainfall runoff model was used to estimate the rate of river seepage for the groen river catchment in namaqualand south africa namaqualand on the northern west coast of south africa supports the highly threatened and rich biodiversity of succulent shrublands van wyk and smith 2001 luther mosebach et al 2012 where changes in species diversity emphasize important differences in hydrology across the landscape while evaporation demand is extremely high in arid environments focal points of wet conditions do exist and drive groundwater recharge as well as other dominant hydrological processes as more uncertainty is associated with hydrological modelling in data scarce environments model calibration was applied for a sub basin where climate and precipitation station density were sufficient to evaluate this approach and understand how transferable it is for other mountainous regions in arid settings the conceptual representation of alluvial aquifer recharge was compared with groundwater residence times and dating for the adjacent buffels river catchment as the effects of climate change have begun to take effect around the world with severe water shortages to many west coast cities and towns of southern africa it is important to constrain future water security concerns understanding how precipitation events influence the renewal rate of groundwater systems in arid environments is important in developing effective adaption strategies as well as benefitting from an increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation events which drives river seepage 2 environmental setting both the groen and the buffels river catchments are located in the namaqualand region of the northern cape province of south africa fig 1 a b the groen catchment is geographically important due to the position of two gauging structures within the basin while the buffels river is more significant in size as well as population garies is the major town situated in the northern part of the groen catchment for the buffels river catchment the major urban centres are the regional town of springbok in the centre of the catchment and the smaller towns of kamieskroon in the south and kleinzee an old mining town on the west coast fig 1c a topographic divide at the peak of the kamies mountains forms the border of the south draining groen catchment as well as the north draining buffels river catchment fig 1c the groen catchment area is 4 715 km2 in size while buffels river is 9 870 km2 and together they make up around half of the namaqualand area 30 560 km2 comprising the majority of namaqualand above 700 m a s l meters above sea level streamflow measurements in the groen catchment exist in the catchment headwater sub basin size 234 km2 and on the swart doring river sub basin size 2 350 km2 which is towards the confluence of these two ephemeral rivers fig 1c and d climate and precipitation stations are spatially distributed across the catchments but in general more stations exist for regions of higher elevation fig 1b 500 m a s l 2 1 climate namaqualand is mainly a semi arid to arid environment with a mediterranean climate as precipitation is received in the winter months of the year the mean annual precipitation map for the region is spatially variable with around 366 mm yr 1 at rooiberg reducing to 80 mm yr 1 towards the outlets of the groen and buffels river catchments fig 1d and table 1 lynch 2004 map for the towns of springbok and kamieskroon is 204 and 230 mm yr 1 respectively map for the town of garies is 150 mm yr 1 while kleinsee on the coast receives on average 77 mm yr 1 with conditions predominately more hyper arid moving up the coastline to namibia over the 100 years of records collected at springbok by the south african weather service saws yearly precipitation rates are variable fig 2 on average 33 wet days per year are received at springbok and the average precipitation event size is 6 5 mm d 1 during particularly wet years map 204 mm average daily precipitation events were between 14 and 19 mm d 1 more recent climatic conditions suggest a lower average daily precipitation event size from 1980 to 1998 fig 2 fog is also a significant contributor to the coastal parts of namaqualand with around 75 days of fog per annum davis et al 2016 although more information is still required to understand whether this plays a role in the catchment water balance the average daily temperatures in the region are often in excess of 35 c in summer with an average daily potential evaporation rate of between 7 and 11 mm d 1 for springbok schulze et al 2007 in winter the daily average temperature is 17 c although night time temperatures reach sub zero degrees and potential evaporation rates are between 3 and 6 mm d 1 for springbok schulze et al 2007 the yearly potential evaporation rate for springbok is 2465 mm schulze et al 2007 which greatly exceeds map lynch 2004 by a factor of 12 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the geology of the groen and buffels river catchments are dominated by the mesoproterozoic granitic gneisses of the little namaqualand suite and the spektakel suite which are part of the bushmanland subprovince bsp macey et al 2018 the little namaqualand suite is comprised of deformed ortho gneisses which includes biotite bearing granitic augen gneisses with strongly recrystalised k feldspar while plutons of concordia granites are prevalent in the buffels river bodies of lekkerdrink gneiss for which the parent material is a generic quartzo felspathic igneous protolith are more prevalent in the groen river catchment macey et al 2011 2018 the coastal plains of the groen and buffels river are comprised of recent aeolian sedimentary deposits groundwater in namaqualand is associated with two main aquifer types 1 primary porosity alluvial aquifers and 2 secondary porosity fractured rock aquifers fig 3 the shallow alluvial aquifers are present throughout the catchment river valley although the alluvial systems become disconnected from each other by irregular surfaces of the underlying basement gneisses benito et al 2011b this means that there are only two alluvial systems thought to be significant aquifers the spektakel and kleinsee aquifers both existing in low lying coastal plains fig 3 the alluvial aquifers are considered to be between 4 and 20 m thick approximately 15 km long and are the main water source for the towns of buffels river and kleinsee benito et al 2011b these aquifers are interlinked with the much deeper fractured bedrock aquifer via a weathering zone unconformity which provides a pathway and conduit for groundwater flow from the deeper granitic gneissic and bedrock aquifers benito et al 2011b van gend et al 2021 while little information is available regarding the significance of the secondary aquifer the granitic and gneissic host rocks are associated with low primary porosity and groundwater is hosted by fractures and joint planes although the effective porosity is variable as these fractures are not always interconnected therefore the granitic and gneissic host rocks are associated with a very low hydraulic conductivity compared with the alluvial aquifer systems 2 3 vegetation and land use the study catchments fall within the namaqualand hardeveld kamiesberg and namaqualand sandveld cape floristic region the dominant vegetation types for the hardeveld bioregion part of the succulent karoo biome are the highly endemic succulent dwarf shrubs schmiedel and oldeland 2018 the kamiesberg is defined as the succulent karoo biome above 1200 m a s l van wyk and smith 2001 comprising the kamiesberg granite fynbos namaqualand granite renosterveld namaqualand klipkoppe shrubland and the kamiesberg mountain shrubland the namaqualand sandveld comprises of the coastal vegetation of the succulent karoo biome covering the northern cape as well as the northern parts of the western cape acocks 1988 cowling et al 1999 these plant species have adapted to low precipitation conditions and are mainly dependent on fog as a source of moisture the differences in vegetation types across namaqualand signify changes in climatic and soil conditions and impact interception infiltration as well as other important hydrological processes 3 materials and methods the j2000 rainfall runoff model krause 2001 together with the modular object oriented system jams kralisch and krause 2006 was used to simulate the hydrological processes of the groen catchment fig 4 the j2000 uses hrus flügel 1995 as spatial entities of homogeneous topology hydrogeology land use and soil paired with a topological routing scheme to simulate flow dynamics at the hillslope scale pfennig et al 2009 the input data required for the j2000 model hru delineation reach routing which contains the deep sink component model calibration and validation are outlined below detailed procedures for the hru delineation as well as soil hydrogeology and land use parameterization are provided in watson et al 2020 2019 2018 additionally detail regarding the simulated hydrological processes of the j2000 model are provided in nepal et al 2019 as this contribution focuses on modifications to the model reach routing 3 1 model inputs 3 1 1 climate and rainfall daily precipitation and climatic data were obtained directly from saws and through the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa platform for the periods 1988 01 01 to 1999 12 31 to align with gauging records section 3 1 2 united states national oceanic and atmospheric administration national climatic data center 2016 in addition daily precipitation within 100 km of the town of garies was extracted from the daily rainfall utility software kunz 2004 which contains an archive of daily precipitation station data originally used to developed the map layer for south africa lynch 2004 of the precipitation data used a high density of measurements exists in the headwaters of the groen as well as near the confluence of the swart doring and groen rivers fig 1c and d additional stations from further inland but still within namaqualand were included to improve the precipitation regionalisation fig 1b climate data which includes air temperature min mean and max windspeed 2 m above ground surface as well as dew point were obtained from three stations in namaqualand fig 1c sunshine duration was obtained from saws stations in the berg river watson et al 2020 which is 300 km away but as soil moisture is the limiting factor for simulated actual evapotranspiration et demand soil moisture it has limited impact on the model results standardized calculations according to allen et al 1998 and penman monteith were used to calculate relative humidity using dew point and tmean and solar radiation sunshine duration that thereafter form the input for potential evapotranspiration calculations within the model 3 1 2 streamflow two gauging structures are located within the groen catchment to monitor streamflow which are both managed and maintained by the department of water and sanitation dws 2020 10 10 fig 1c the data was attained from the dws portal and grdc global runoff data centre 1999 the leliefontein gauge dwa id f5h002 is located in the headwater of the groen and is fed by the kamies mountains the bruintjieshoogte gauge dwa id f5h001 is located on the swart doring river towards the confluence of the swart doring and groen rivers for the model calibration data was used from 1990 to 2000 with an emphasis on the floods of 1996 and 1997 as understanding the losses that occur during high flows is important for alluvial aquifer recharge benito et al 2011a 3 1 3 hydrogeology a 1 250 000 geological map obtained from the council of geosciences macey et al 2011 along with aquifer properties from literature domenico and schwartz 1990 tankard et al 2012 was used to determine the hydrogeological inputs for the j2000 model fig 3 in addition the geological map was used to determine which reach segments experience seepage and require the use of the deep sink component fig 5 since there is limited data on aquifer properties for the groen catchment bulk literature values domenico and schwartz 1990 as well as recent j2000 model parameters from other catchments in the western cape were used bugan 2014 treumer 2016 watson et al 2018 2019 2020 the information transferred includes storage capacity storage coefficient maximum aquifer thickness and recession coefficients for the upper and lower aquifers in this regard the upper primary aquifer is comprised of the alluvial sediments while the lower secondary aquifer is made up of granitic and gneissic formations 3 1 4 soils the j2000 uses two soil pore storages namely middle pore storage mps 0 2 50 µm and large pore storage lps 50 µm as the input soil data the harmonized world soil database hwsd version 1 2 batjes et al 2012 and rosetta lite pedotransfer within the hydrus model šimůnek et al 2006 were used to estimate these inputs hwsd is a 30 arc second raster database and has been used in previous jams j2000 models in southern africa watson et al 2018 2019 2020 the textural characteristics sand silt and clay ssc within the hwsd was used to estimate the wilting point 15 000 mbar and to generate soil hydraulic properties of theta vs depth using a constant upper and lower head boundary to calculate mps the field capacity of the soil water holding capacities at 15000 and 60 mbar were used to estimate the amount of water held against gravity or the amount of lps the water holding capacities between 0 mbar and 60 mbar were subtracted finally the total water holding capacity of mps and lps was determined by multiplication with the respective soil horizon depths given that limited soil observations were available in the study region as well as uncertainty with the derived mps and lps using hwsd a lumped parameter scaling factor fc adaption mps and ac adaption lps were used to scale the field capacity fc and air capacity ac within the soil dataset see 3 4 for model calibration 3 1 5 land use the j2000 model requires albedo monthly surface resistances assuming sufficient water supply leaf area index lai for vegetational growth periods effective vegetation heights for growth periods root depth and sealed grade value of area with impervious surface as the input land use data the spatial extent of the different land uses was determined using the 2013 2014 south african national land cover dataset geoterraimage and together with literature information johnson 1983 van 1984 crain 1998 amer and hatfield 2004 munitz et al 2017 was used to derive the input land use data 3 2 hydrological response unit delineation the web based grass hru delineation tool schwartze 2008 was used to determine the hrus for the groen catchment its delineation procedure combines gauging structure locations 2 gauges a digital elevation model dem shuttle radar topography mission srtm 90 m and maps of land use geology and soils to create sets of the hrus and river reaches that represent the spatial modelling units in a first step a sink filling approach is applied on the dem followed by the calculation of different dem derivates including slope aspect and flow accumulation directions in a second step the latter are used to delineate the stream network and related sub basins using a threshold for the minimum sub basin size to determine the level of stream delineation detail in a third step an overlay analysis combines slope aspect elevation delineated sub basins and maps of land use soil and geology a minimum size threshold is used to remove sliver polygons size 14 cells or 0 19 km2 for the catchment during a fourth step the flow accumulation map is used to generate the flow routing network that connects the hrus with one another and to the reach segments a similar routing scheme is calculated for the reach segments allowing for water transport through the channel network finally the hru statistics including area elevation slope aspect watershed sub basin land use geology soil and topological neighbours hru reach were generated for each hru for reaches statistics about slope length width and downstream neighbour were calculated the minimum threshold for the sub basin and hru size is determined by a manual iterative procedure to ensure a good level of model detail as well as keeping run times to a realistic level 3 3 reach processes the reach based simulation in the model considers three main processes i e i water routing between adjacent reach segments ii seepage of water from the river channel and iii evapotranspiration of water from the alluvial riverbed 3 3 1 routing the flow routing in the model is based on individual reach segments that are connected according to the flow topology in the region the calculation of runoff q from a single reach follows the kinematic wave approach in which the outflow is a function of the available water volume v and a retention coefficient rk according to 1 q v e 1 rk this retention coefficient rk depends on the flow velocity v in the reach segment the stream length fl and a reach routing calibration parameter ta 2 rk v fl t a 3600 the flow velocity in the reaches and therefore the delay between water entering the stream and its arrival at the outlet is calculated based on the manning strickler equation krause 2002 this approach uses the manning roughness coefficient m slope of the river bed i and hydraulic radius rh to calculate flow velocity v as 3 v m rh 2 3 i 1 2 while m and i are static attributes of the reach segment rh is calculated based on the cross section area a in which the water is flowing through and reach width b as 4 rh a b 2 a b here the cross section area a is a function of the available water volume v and the flow velocity v 5 a v v while the approach described above allows calculating the overall runoff q from a single reach q is further subdivided into four flow components i e surface runoff q r d 1 interflow q r d 2 upper groundwater flow q r g 1 and lower groundwater flow q r g 2 this separation is done based on the proportions of these components in the initial water volume v that has accumulated in the current time step 3 3 2 seepage for reach segments where the seepage is to be applied fig 5 the calculated runoff q eqs 1 5 is further adapted before reach routing first a leakage area l area is determined as 5 l area rh 2 f l taking the calculated runoff q from the reach into account this seepage volume deepsink w is then calculated as 6 deepsink w min l area k sink sink α q where k sink is the hydraulic conductivity for the riverbed m d and sink α is a scaling parameter used to adjust k sink as part of the model calibration section 3 4 the deepsink volume is finally removed from the calculated runoff q 7 q q deepsink w in order to consider different hydraulic conductivities under wet and dry conditions of the river channel each reach segment comprises two distinct k sink values i e k sink wet and k sink dry during seepage simulation the model will switch automatically between those two values depending on whether the water level in the reach falls below a defined threshold k sink k sink dry or not k sink k sink wet after deepsink w was calculated it is split into two components the first component deepsink gw represents the leaked water which contributes to the model s groundwater storage the second component deepsink sw represents the remaining water volume that contributes to the soil water storage of the related alluvial river bed while deepsink gw is considered to be permanently stored in the aquifer deepsink sw will be subject to an evapotranspiration process in the river floodplain therefore both components will not contribute to the outflow from the basin 3 3 3 evapotranspiration in alluvial bed the water volume deepsink sw redirected to the soil water storage of the alluvial river bed is input to the lumped soil water simulation of the jams j2k model in order to simulate the actual evapotranspiration from this storage a potential evapotranspiration based on the penman monteith approach is calculated according to the standard pet calculation in the model allen et al 1998 for this purpose landuse and soil parameters are defined for each river segment 3 4 model calibration for the model calibration a fully automated non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii deb et al 2002 was used the lower and upper bounds range for the calibrated parameters was set using previous expert knowledge of plausible j2000 model parameters table 2 the calibration was performed from 1990 to 1999 with a two year warm up period 1998 1990 during which streamflow and precipitation records overlapped to evaluate the performance of the calibration procedure various efficiency criteria were selected that focused on different aspects of the simulated hydrograph the kling gupta efficiency kge was selected as the dominant efficiency criteria due to its general ability to assess the correlation bias and the variability of simulated and observed streamflow gupta et al 2009 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash 1970 in standard squared form e2 was also selected due to its ability to assess hydrological model performance overall because e2 typically over represents peak flows the logarithmic form of the nse loge2 was used to assess the simulated low flows nash sutcliffe efficiency as unsquared residuals e1 and the log of unsquared residuals loge1 were used to supplement the selected efficiency criteria finally bias was used to quantify the overall estimation error 3 5 sensitivity analysis to understand the relative importance of different calibration parameters and related hydrological processes a regional sensitivity analysis rsa was used hornberger and spear 1981 as part of the rsa more commonly called monte carlo analysis mca model parameters were split into behavioural good and non behavioural bad populations pianosi et al 2016 using the kge model efficiency using this approach the calibrated value of each parameter p was randomly increased decreased by up to 10 i e values where sampled from the interval 0 9 p cal 1 1 p cal where p cal was the calibrated value of p for each sample the simulated runoff was analysed by means of the kge efficiency criteria to assess the overall parameter sensitivity the model variables involved in the mca include ac adaptation fc adaptation a rain soilconcrd2 soilmaxinfwinter soilmaxperc flowrouteta sink a and drythreshold table 1 4 results the j2000 model was used to simulate the hydrological behaviour of the groen river considering the impact that seepage has on catchment streamflow before the simulated seepage is presented an evaluation is required of the regionalised precipitation and the station density difference between the upstream and downstream sub basins in the delineation an average sub basin and hru size of 12 15 km2 and 0 3 km2 was generated respectively where in total 14534 hrus were used by the model while the data availability climate land use soil and hydrogeology would not warrant a detailed hru delineation the distance between the hrus and the nearest climate station impacts the selection of the respected streamflow gauges the station density and the overall difference in elevation between the hrus and the precipitation stations impacts the regionalised precipitation as there is an average elevation difference between the upstream 798 m a s l and downstream sub basin 710 m a s l a comparison is be made between high and low altitude stations thereafter the observed and simulated streamflow is outlined finally the percentage seepage for the reaches in the catchment as well as the two different sub basins are presented 4 1 observed precipitation analysis of the observed precipitation is aggregated into upstream high altitude stations 700 m a s l which includes karkams and kamieskroon and downstream low altitude stations 400 m a s l which includes rietpoort and nuwerus fig 6 these locations also correspond to the closest precipitation stations for each modelled sub basin and therefore receive a high regionalised weight while karkams and nuwerus have no observed data for 1990 and data was only available for these stations after 1991 03 01 kamieskroon and rietpoort have data available prior to 1990 in the following analysis wet years were considered to be years where precipitation exceeded map while dry years precipitation was less than map precipitation for the stations was mainly received between mid may to late july following a winter precipitation pattern fig 7 b the map observed for karkams and kamieskroon was 341 and 298 mm table 3 wet years include 1996 and 1997 where in excess of 450 mm was measured at karkams and 380 mm at kamieskroon respectively fig 7a and table 3 5 mm in 1997 05 25 was recorded for karkams while 73 mm was recorded at kamieskroon for the same day other large events of 55 5 47 5 and 43 mm were recorded at karkams during 1993 1994 and 1996 fig 6 at kamieskroon depths of 48 48 46 mm were recorded in 1990 1995 and 1994 fig 6 the map for rietpoort and nuwerus was 142 7 and 179 3 mm respectively table 3 wet years at rietpoort include 1996 and 1997 while at nuwerus 1997 and 1995 were the wettest with in excess of 200 mm being recorded fig 7a and table 3 on average the daily precipitation event size was 6 mm for rietpoort std 2 0 mm and 5 mm at nuwerus std 2 4 mm the maximum daily precipitation at rietpoort was 49 5 mm in 1994 06 29 while 69 mm was recorded at nuwerus on 1997 05 25 table 3 other large events of 26 20 5 and 20 mm were recorded at rietpoort in 1993 1991 and 1999 fig 6 at nuwerus higher than average daily depths of 42 5 24 5 and 22 mm of precipitation were recorded in 1993 1994 and 1995 4 2 regionalised precipitation the average distance between the hrus and the precipitation stations for the upstream groen sub basin was 8 km while for the downstream swart doring it was 27 3 km fig 8 a and ai the average difference in elevation between the hrus and the precipitation stations for the upstream groen sub basin was 180 m while for swart doring it was 214 m fig 8b and bi the regionalised map for the upstream groen sub basin was 306 5 mm compared with 341 and 298 observed at karkams and kamieskroon table 4 for the swart doring the regionalised map was 184 7 mm compared with 142 7 and 179 3 observed at rietpoort and nuwerus table 3 wet years for groen include 1995 1996 and 1997 with 380 mm while for swart doring 1993 1995 and 1996 yielded 200 mm the average regionalised precipitation event size was 5 2 mm for groen and 2 5 mm for swart doring table 4 the maximum regionalised precipitation event size was 65 1 mm for groen and 31 3 for swart doring other large events include 45 39 and 32 mm for groen during 1993 1994 and 1996 for swart doring events of 20 7 20 9 and 19 6 were regionalised during 1994 1997 and 1998 4 3 observed streamflow while the j2000 operates on a daily timestep and both inputs and outputs have a daily resolution observed and simulated streamflow is rather presented as both daily fig 9 a and monthly data fig 9b to assess the model s ability to represent catchment seasonal variations the maximum observed streamflow for the groen gauge was 17 24 m3 s 1 on 1996 08 27 with another significant event of 15 38 m3 s 1 on 1997 06 28 fig 9a for the other monitoring years 1990 1991 1993 1994 and 1995 a maximum streamflow of 1 8 m3 s 1 was measured peak flow was mainly prevalent from april to october each year and generally 0 25 m3 s the maximum streamflow for the swart doring gauge was 15 0 m3 s on 1997 06 29 with 13 7 m3 s on the following day supp fig 1 for the years 1990 1991 1993 and 1994 a maximum of 0 57 m3 s was observed similar to groen observed streamflow was more prevalent between april to october with 90 of the observed runoff 4 4 simulated streamflow the performance of the j2000 model was assessed visually as well as using the various selected performance evaluation criteria as the distance between the hrus and the nearest climate station for swart doring was nearly double that of the groen and considerably less precipitation was received for lower altitudes the station density was deemed insufficient for a calibration at the downstream gauge swart doring below the daily exceedance probability for the measured and simulated streamflow is presented for the groen river with a focus on specific peak flows as this has more impact on the amount of seepage the extreme climatic conditions of the catchment meant that a low efficiency performance was expected where streamflow for the groen only comprised 6 1 3 if seepage is included of the total water balance for the headwaters supp fig 2 in general considering the availability of climate data the model was able to simulate the observed streamflow well for the groen sub basin which is underlined by a bias of 0 13 fig 9 the simulation of catchment low flows was well represented with a loge2 of 0 74 where the model simulated 0 002 m3 s for the 30th percentile as opposed to 0 m3 s observed the model performed worse at representing peak flow with the 1 exceedance probability of 1 28 m3 s for simulated and 0 82 m3 s for observed streamflow although an e2 of 0 38 was less satisfactory than the other efficiencies it was mainly linked to a single large event that was not simulated by the model or not fully measured by the climate stations the event of 1996 08 27 where 17 24 m3 s was observed as streamflow and three days prior precipitation amounted to 81 mm was simulated as 0 45 m3 s by the model and the dominant cause of the low e2 performance the event in 1997 06 28 of 15 37 m3 s 1 which was simulated as 8 23 m3 s 1 was better represented with five days prior precipitation of 104 mm 4 5 simulated seepage the simulated seepage is a function of a number of reach variables which include the area slope dry and wet hydraulic conductivity and distribution of alluvial to bedrock seepage the optimized seepage rate was estimated to be 56 m d 1 for the entire basin which was the most realistic parameter combination and a compromise between simulation of peak and low flows refer to section 5 3 as a second calibration was not possible for the much larger and downstream swart doring sub basin the estimated seepage rate for the entire basin using the upstream calibration remains very uncertain as a means to conceptualise the possible effects of river seepage these results will still be presented in the headwater parts of the groen and swart doring reaches with a high percentage seepage 0 4 0 7 were characterised as long segments 8000 m seldom with a width 5 m fig 10 c as headwater reaches are often steep 2 5 seepage was limited due to the high average flow velocity fig 10c high percentage loss 2 for reaches in the swart doring and groen valley were characterised by moderate slope 1 5 and long reach length 8000 m fig 10a c closest to the swart doring gauge low reach slope 0 7 results in a high percentage seepage 85 fig 10c d towards the catchment outlet and representing the low valley portion of the groen catchment reach width 15 m and slope 0 7 lead to a high percentage seepage 2 3 4 4 fig 10a c 4 6 model parameter sensitivity parameters which were deemed insensitive where a distinction between best group and worst group was very small straight line were excluded from the sensitivity analysis results this meant that only nine parameters were analysed with their sensitivities being distinctly different table 1 and supp fig 3 the sensitivity analysis showed three groups these include low moderate and high sensitivity which were essentially controlled by the deviations between the worst and best model groups fig 11 parameters regarded as low sensitivity include soilmaxinfwinter maximum infiltration rate for winter soilmaxperc leaching of water to groundwater storage and drythreshold reach water level value used to switch between kwet and kdry parameters regarded as moderate sensitivity were fc adaptation scaling factor for lps a rain vegetation interception volume soilconcrd2 surface runoff delay parameter and sink a multiplier to scale hydraulic conductivity of river beds the only parameter regarded as highly sensitive was fc adaptation scaling factor for mps 5 discussion the aim of this study was to integrate a river seepage component into the j2000 rainfall runoff model that could be applied in arid and semi arid environments to test the effectiveness of the new component seepage was determined for the groen river catchment south africa the model regionalisation results showed distinct differences in the density of precipitation stations for the upstream and downstream sub basins and therefore the potential impact on the modelling results needs to first be considered as seepage forms a mechanism of recharge to alluvial aquifer systems the results of this study will be compared with other recharge estimation methods this is illustrated through translation of the approach to the buffels river catchment to the immediate north the buffels river catchment has similar climatic environmental and hydrogeological conditions and due to its larger population it has been the focus of recent work on groundwater quality and residence time van rooyen and miller submitted van gend et al 2021 but as previously stated has no active gauging structures finally the effectiveness of the calibration procedure is discussed highlighting the uncertainty of the optimized parameters the seepage component has been developed with the aim to be used in data scarce regions although as it is a conceptual approach its physical representation of river seepage needs to be evaluated 5 1 effect of station density on modelling results the importance of good precipitation data for hydrological modelling purposes cannot be overstated and this has been recognised by many studies borga and vizzaccaro 1997 campling et al 2001 spadavecchia and williams 2009 huang et al 2019 watson et al 2020 one of the most significant problems with undertaking hydrological modelling in sub saharan africa is the variation in climate station density that impacts regionalisation of precipitation records this issue becomes more pronounced when utilising two or more gauges for model calibration and validation in this study two major sub basins were considered the groen and the larger swart doring while recommended station densities for modelling purposes are largely unknown for arid southern africa modelling results for the semi arid berg river show a high performance e2 0 81 loge2 0 84 in regions with an average hru to station distance of 12 km watson et al 2020 considering this the groen sub basin was well within this range 8 km but swart doring was twice 27 3 km these suggested values and therefore not recommended for this model calibration fig 8ai bi as a result model uncertainty for the entire basin was high given the uncertainty of both the optimised parameter set as well as the input climate data furthermore limitations in the number of peak flow events the size of the calibrated catchment as well as the number of reaches in the sub basin groen impacts the tangible conclusions made about river seepage for the region 5 2 river seepage as source of recharge previous research in the area has suggested that seepage is not significant and on average only once every 5 10 years is recharge generated from floodwater benito et al 2011b the results of this study confirm this as during wet years more than five times more seepage is routed to the alluvial aquifer than during dry years fig 12 small events which were more frequent were mostly evaporated transpired via the alluvial bed and do not contribute to deeper groundwater stores supp fig 4 events such as 1996 09 17 recorded by the swart doring gauge as 8 8 m3 s 1 and 1997 06 29 of 14 m3 s 1 were estimated to surpass the bed evaporation demand as well as the seepage rate with streamflow observed at the downstream gauge the frequency and occurrence of years of significant recharge is however considered to be more regular than suggested by benito et al 2011b and would seem from this limited data to be every two years fig 9 years where three to four events of 50 mm d 1 and the number of precipitation events exceeds a depth threshold of 300 mm have been estimated to be significant the seepage of the catchment varies greatly across the different reaches but in general for the catchment valley with gentle slopes between 150 and 300 mm yr 1 of water was routed via seepage to the alluvial aquifer fig 12 while additional information is needed to constrain the simulation of percolation e g watson et al 2018 the simulated seepage rate exceeds a maximum of 5 to 30 mm yr 1 of percolation for the hrus across the catchment area simulated percolation exceeds that of seepage as well as the rate of alluvial bed evapotranspiration fig 13 the comparison between percolation and seepage illustrates the importance of floodwater in recharging the alluvial aquifer system confirming the presence of extensive aquifers beneath and in river bed materials typically shallow boreholes taping into alluvial aquifers are assumed to contain young or modern groundwater that is directly linked to present day precipitation in the buffels river catchment residence time calculations based on mixing relationships between 14c and 3h radio isotope tracers indicate a mix of ages between a modern end member to a holocene or older en member component 12 700 years van gend et al 2021 van rooyen 2021 these mixing relationships are strong support for continual seepage from the river channel contributing smaller but constant recharge to the alluvial system leading to a spectrum of groundwater residence times as the local community and municipality in namaqualand is reliant on the alluvial aquifer as a major source of water changes in precipitation patterns which impact river quick flow can have severe impacts on the availability of groundwater in the future climate change projections for namaqualand suggest more variability in daily temperatures although no consensus is available regarding the frequency and intensity of precipitation taylor et al 2013a davis et al 2016 future changes in both temperature as well as precipitation can have significant impacts on catchment hydrological response which can impact both the quality as well as the quantity of groundwater available to the local residence of namaqualand 5 3 seepage simulation in hydrological modelling in humid and tropical environments model uncertainties generally decrease with an increase in catchment area and precipitation input signal to noise ratio xue et al 2013 the reason for this is that general reach routing approaches such as the kinematic wave equation accumulate flow along the reach network the opposite occurs when considering river seepage where water is lost upon transmission and evapotranspiration from the alluvial bed in this study the calibration was applied for a small sub basin comprising only 5 of the total area the addition of a sink a as well as drythreshold parameter meant that the model was capable of simulating catchment low flows log e2 0 74 with lower parameter values yielding only slight improvements for peak flow simulation in general majority of the nsga ii solutions yielded high sink a as well as high drythreshold values supp fig 3 the selection of the best solution considered the upper and lower limits of the parameter bounds as the nsga ii optimiser tended to go past realistic parameter values this was more common for parameters of low sensitivity but also occurred for the seepage parameters of sink a and drythreshold while the mca showed which parameter values are sensitive and carry a higher uncertainty for the upstream location fig 11 downstream it is presumed that parameter sensitivities would be different in addition to potential differences in hydrological processes and runoff behaviour between headwater and valley regions the seepage functions are suggested to become more sensitive downstream for arid conditions the resultant effect of the automatic directed calibration using nsga ii was that the model parameters focused on reducing evapotranspiration and baseflow to generate more quick flow in the form of interflow and overland flow while the selected parameters for the model are explainable for the region where flash flood events exist with high magnitudes especially in catchment headwaters high uncertainty remains in applying these parameters for the entire catchment as groundwater recharge is heterogeneous in nature distributed rainfall runoff models include the necessary variables to simulate both spatial and temporal differences in recharge different recharge mechanisms such as river seepage can be represented but require dense precipitation station networks as well as good measurements to constrain different model parameters and reduce uncertainty in precipitation inputs the daily temporal resolution of the rainfall runoff model is important in representing extreme precipitation events which drive alluvial aquifer recharge this seepage model has the potential to improve the physical representation of runoff generation in arid and semi arid environments using hydrological modelling systems where intermittent flow can significantly influence model representation 5 4 applicability of distributed modelling in arid environments understanding the rate of river seepage is a complex process as the mechanism can vary substantially for different landscapes and environments and measurements are time consuming and error prone in situations where river channels are connected to highly conductive basement aquifers the rate of seepage often only becomes significant for much larger events and for small to medium events seepage is minimal lange et al 1998 in such environments it is more common that only once a certain runoff threshold is exceeded does seepage become significant lange 2005 in situations where river channels are disconnected from the basement aquifer or the basement aquifer has a low hydraulic conductivity the rate of seepage is much larger for small events and decreases once the sink areas of the river channel become saturated knighton and nanson 1994 in this study a seepage model was developed for an environment where the basement aquifer is presumed to have a low hydraulic conductivity observations from the downstream swart doring gauge where discharge was often less than upstream suggest that the rate of seepage is high during days of consecutive precipitation and under wet conditions to improve the transferability of the river seepage model easily derivable reach variables similar to hughes 2019 were used to represent the alluvial evapotranspiration as well as seepage to the deeper aquifer using a wet and dry hydraulic conductivity large discharge events such as 1997 06 29 were poorly represented and an implementation of a varying rate dependant on channel flow volume could benefit model simulations for arid conditions due to high uncertainty in the climate data this was not further explored and remains a focus for future work on river seepage as the river channel and ecosystems linked with the river channel are important for understanding exchanges in the phreatic zone incorporating factors that impact transmission loss as well as river seepage are required for ecohydrological investigations 6 conclusion understanding dominant recharge mechanisms is important for protecting groundwater from over exploitation and contamination in arid environments of southern africa limited understanding is available regarding recharge dynamics due to climatic and biophysical data limitations while arid environments experience harsh climatic conditions there is still a presence of young groundwater indicating that recharge is actively occurring as the potential for evaporation far surpasses the amount of yearly precipitation the source of young groundwater can often be unknown in this study a seepage component was integrated into the j2000 rainfall runoff model in order to determine the rate of alluvial aquifer recharge which occurs during streamflow transmission the seepage component made use of a number of physical properties to firstly constrain the amount of alluvial evapotranspiration and thereafter facilitate river seepage under wet and dry channel conditions the approach was applied to the groen river a region where residents in the catchment and neighbouring catchments are particularly reliant on the alluvial aquifer system for water supply while the simulation of river seepage downstream was highly uncertain partly attributed to poor climatic data these results suggest that during wet years significant amounts of recharge occur on average 150 to 300 mm yr 1 with the channel slope being the largest physical property which controls simulated seepage during dry years significantly less seepage occurs 6 to 15 mm yr 1 where seepage can be equivalent to simulated percolation across the reach area the approach highlights the importance of extreme precipitation events for generating recharge to alluvial aquifers in arid environments which through seepage are actively recharged water sources the j2000 seepage component has the potential to improve the physical representation of hydrological behaviour in arid and semi arid environments where intermittent flow can significantly influence river transmission loss credit authorship contribution statement andrew watson conceptualization methodology software data

4317,rill detachment is the most important erosive process in steep slopes and its comprehension and prediction accuracy is important to properly develop soil conservation practices in forest areas this process is largely influenced by sediment size soil slope and water flow characteristics but the results of the studies that have explored these influences are contrasting this study has simulated in an experimental flume the rill detachment capacity dc of soil with five particle sizes 0 0 25 0 25 0 5 0 5 1 1 2 and 2 3 mm at five water flow rates 0 26 0 35 0 45 0 56 and 0 67 l m 1 s 1 and five bed slopes 3 5 9 1 19 2 29 1 and 38 3 on samples collected in a forestland of northern iran dc was significantly higher by 70 for sediments size over 1 mm compared to the other soil fractions and increased primarily with soil slope and secondarily with water depth a modelling approach has shown that the unit stream power is the best predictor of dc using power equations nse over 0 87 linear regression models between dc and shear stress τ were very accurate r2 over 0 80 with few exceptions in predicting both rill erodibility and critical shear stress when developed separately for each particle size class sediments with size higher than 1 mm had lower resistance to rill erosion compared to the finer fractions overall the study helps to better understand particle detachment of the erosion process on which particle size is a key parameter the modelling activity proposes to land planners values of the rill erodibility and critical shear stress of forested areas for applications in process based erosion models keywords shear stress rill erodibility plantation unit stream power rill erosion different sizes of sediment 1 introduction soil erosion is a severe threat for ecosystem health in many parts of the world rodrigo comino et al 2018 cerdà et al 2021 borrelli et al 2021 bezak et al 2021 in the water erosion process overland flow is the most important agent of particle detachment together with raindrop impact erosion in rills is dominant compared to laminar erosion in steep hillslopes moreover rill erosion is different between shallow or deep waters as well high low and high flow rates zhang et al 2002 soil detachment by shallow flow happens when the maximum force exerted by highly turbulent water is greater than the resistance between soil particles sediment size plays an important role in the soil detachment process since the particle dimensions influence the turbulence and detachability in sediment laden flow liu et al 2019 however the influence of sediment size in reducing or increasing soil detachment rates is sometimes contrasting in literature due to the different experimental conditions and the number of factors influencing particle detachment e g soil slope water flow rates sediment concentration for example ali et al 2012 and liu et al 2019 state that rill detachment is different from finer to coarser sediments the experimental results by ali et al 2012 showed that the flow velocity and therefore soil detachment decreases with increasing median grain size according to liu et al 2019 the sediment median size had a pronounced negative impact on the detachment rates similarly nearing et al 1991 found that the detachment rate of soils with coarse particles increases compared to finer soils conversely merten et al 2001 showed that detachment rate increases with decreasing sediment size thus more research is needed in order to clarify these waiving results of the literature studies rill detachment capacity may be even different in soils that although being of the same type and use and subjected to the same management are covered by different tree species parhizkar et al 2021a the root system of plants may influence soil aggregate stability and therefore soil detachment de baets et al 2006 moreover the rill detachment rates in reforested soils are significantly higher compared to the values measured in natural forests parhizkar et al 2021b therefore it is important to investigate the importance of sediment size on soil detachment in reforested soils when soil is planted with trees an accurate evaluation of the areas that are more exposed to rill erosion is essential in order to choose the most protective species pollen 2007 vannoppen et al 2015 vannoppen et al 2017 thus the estimation of soil detachment capacity together with the factors that influence this parameter is important to assess not only whether a soil is exposed to non tolerable erosion rates erosion models are useful tools to help land managers adopting the most effective anti erosive practices parhizkar et al 2021d many process based erosion models use soil detachment capacity as key input parameter nearing et al 1989 nearing et al 1999 li et al 2015 therefore accurate estimations of rill detachment capacity are essential to achieve reliable predictions in forest ecosystems that are prone to erosion this study has analysed the rill detachment capacity through flume experiments on soils sampled in a reforested area with steep slopes of northern iran more specifically we have i evaluated the impact of different sediment size on soil detachment rate at variable water flow rates and soil slopes and ii setup simple models to predict the soil detachment capacity and rill erodibility from hydraulic parameters for each studied sediment size we hypothesize that the rill detachment process is significantly variable with sediment size with higher detachability of coarser soil fractions and steeper soils and the prediction models developed in this study are able to take into account this variability 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experiments were conducted in the laboratory of soil physics at the guilan university iran on soil samples collected in the saqalaksar forestland park 37 09 24 n 49 31 50 e northern iran fig 1 the park is located in guilan province 15 km south of rasht city at an elevation of about 60 m above the mean sea level the climate conditions of the area are typically mediterranean csa type koppen geiger classification kottek et al 2006 with mean annual values of precipitation and temperature of 1360 mm and 16 3 c respectively the soil of the park is silty clay loamy according to the usda classification on average 33 5 of clay 46 8 of silt and 19 6 of sand the mean bulk density of soil is 1 2 g cm3 parhizkar et al 2021c while its mean organic matter content 1 42 other soil properties are reported in parhizkar et al 2021a the vegetal biodiversity in the park is large with a great variety of tree and shrub species mainly zelkova carpinifolia quercus castaneifolia alnus glutinosa parrotia persica pinus taeda and carpinus betulus 80 of the park area beside these natural species other species were planted in this forestland and then subjected to different management operations such as harvesting tree planting and fires parhizkar et al 2021c some of these management practices targeted to rehabilitation of this forestland have modified soil properties including soil detachment capacity parhizkar et al 2021a 2 2 soil sampling soil was randomly but uniformly sampled in different points of the experimental area about one samples each 2000 m2 fig 1 after sampling soil was transferred to the laboratory where each sample was separated into five sediment size classes i 0 0 25 mm clay silt and very fine to fine sand ii 0 25 0 5 mm medium sand iii 0 5 1 mm coarse sand iv 1 2 mm very coarse sand and v 2 3 mm gravel sieves with meshes of 4 2 1 and 1 mm were used respectively hereinafter the five classes will be indicated using the mean value of the range i 0 125 mm for clay silt and very fine to fine sand ii 0 375 mm for medium sand iii 0 75 mm for coarse sand iv 1 5 mm for very coarse sand and v 2 5 mm for gravel 2 3 measurement of rill detachment capacity rill detachment capacity dc kg s 1 m 2 of the soil samples was

in parhizkar et al 2020a parhizkar et al 2020b parhizkar et al 2021a and parhizkar et al 2021b the experiments were carried out for each sediment size class and dc was measured at five water flow rates 0 26 0 35 0 45 0 56 and 0 67 l m 1 s 1 and five gradients of the flume bed 3 5 9 1 19 2 29 1 and 38 3 each experiment consisted of four replicates overall 500 soil samples 5 sediment size classes 5 water flow rates 5 slope gradients 4 repetitions were tested the experimental procedure consisted of the following steps each soil sample was packed in a steel ring diameter of 0 1 m and height of 0 05 m and then was saturated by wetting for 24 h before the flume experiment then the sample was inserted in a hole of the flume bed close to the downstream outlet after the setup of flow rate and bed gradient in the flume the experiment started pouring water from the upstream side and a stable water level was waited for the maximum duration of each experiment was 300 s but sometime the experimental test was ended before this limit when a depth of 0 015 m of soil was eroded from the steel ring after the experiment the wet soil sample was oven dried and weighed the mean flow rate was checked by collecting and measuring five samples of water downstream of the flume by a graduated plastic cylinder following abrahams et al 1985 the average water velocity was also determined as the mean of seven measurements and this value was reduced by 0 6 0 7 or 0 8 factors for laminar transitional or turbulent conditions respectively the mean water depth was measured by averaging six measures in two cross sections of the flume using a level probe with accuracy of 1 mm parhizkar et al 2020a given the importance of water depth for the evaluation of dc the accuracy of this measure was further checked using a self made digital instrument in summary this device consisted of two sections of which the first was a printed circuit board pcb for the detection of the water level in the flume and the second contained a junction box and a led display dc was calculated as the mean value of the four replicates of each experiment at a given flow rate and bed gradient using eq 1 1 d c δ m

these parameters are reported in parhizkar et al 2020a and parhizkar et al 2020c while the related values measured or calculated for each experiment are reported in table 1 the rill erodibility kr and critical shear stress τc which are important parameters for estimating soil resistance to rill erosion wang et al 2014 were calculated as the slope and intercept of the following equation regressing dc and τ 2 d c k r τ τ c 2 4 statistical analysis prior to the experiments we run a 2 way analysis of variance anova considering the rill detachment capacity as dependent variable and soil slope and flow discharge as factors independent variables including their interaction this allowed identifying that both soil slope and flow discharge but not their interaction play a significant influence on dc then anova was applied to dc dependent variable and five sediment size classes factors in both cases the normality of sample distribution was checked by qq plot tests the pairwise comparison by tukey s test at p 0 05 was used to assess the statistical significance of the differences in dc among the various sizes of sediments moreover non linear models were used to evaluate possible regressions between dc and hydraulic parameters the models are based on power equations as suggested in the previous studies parhizkar et al 2020a parhizkar et al 2020c parhizkar et al 2021a the root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the coefficient of determination r2 were used as evaluation criteria to verify the accuracy of these equations the satisfactory values of these evaluation criteria are 50 of observed standard deviation for rmse over 0 35 for nse and over 0 50 for r2 if nse is over 0 75 the model prediction capacity of a variable is good moriasi et al 2007 singh et al 2004 van liew and garbrecht 2003 all statistical analyses were carried out using xlstat 9 0 software 3 results 3 1 variability of rill detachment capacity with sediment size water depth and soil slope the preliminary anova showed that both soil slope and flow rate but not their interaction p 0 924 have a significant influence p 0 0001 on the rill detachment capacity table 2 dc was similar p 0 05 among three sediment size classes 0 125 0 375 and 0 75 in contrast dc of the two coarser sediment classes 1 5 and 2 5 mm was significantly p 0 05 different from the finer classes the highest dc was measured for the coarser class 0 047 kg m 2 s 1 while the finer sediments showed the lowest value 0 0263 kg m 2 s 1 moreover dc of each class was highly variable around the mean value of each class as shown by the large standard deviations fig 3 3 2 relationships between rill detachment capacity and hydraulic parameters the power equations between dc and flow depth h at different soil slopes s and sediment size classesd showed high to very high correlations r2 0 66 with a maximum of 0 99 between these two variables with dc increasing with s and h in each sediment class the exponent of the equations increases with s athough not monotonically table 3 and fig 4 for all sediment classes dc was predicted with very high accuracy by power eq 1 based on the unit stream power ω this good prediction capacity is confirmed by the very high evaluation criteria which were all very high table 4 conversely the equations using the stream power ω and shear stress τ as input showed a lower but satisfactory prediction capacity of dc the mean flow velocity v and unit flow energy were poor predictors of dc table 4 grouping all the studied sediment size classes of soil eq 2 applied to couples of dc vs shear stress τ showed good although not very high coefficients of determination 0 61 r2 0 70 data not shown when dc was regressed against τ separately for each sediment class the coefficients of determination increased up to values over 0 80 with two exceptions soil slopes of 9 1 and sediment classes of 1 5 mm table 5 and fig 5 rill erodibility kr and critical shear stress τc were clearly different for sediments of variable class and soil slopes kr generally increased with the mean diameter of the sediments although this increase was not always uniform fig 6 in addition τc increased with sediment diameter and soil slope also in this case not uniformly fig 7 4 discussion the influence of sediment size on soil detachment has been widely investigated but the contrasting results of the studies have suggested an analysis in hillslopes with variable steepness in reforested areas of northern iran the experimental study at the laboratory scale has confirmed that rill detachment which is the dominant erosion agent in slopes with the highest gradients is different from finer to coarser sediments ali et al 2012 liu et al 2019 in more detail under the same flow rate the variations in rill detachment capacity among the five sediment size classes under investigation were noticeable with significantly higher rill detachment capacity for sediments size higher than 1 mm and lower compared to size smaller than 1 mm this result could be explained by four reasons first the flow energy is mainly spent to detach the sediments of higher size which leads to a lower detachment rate for finer classes this is in accordance with liu et al 2019 who stated that the flow energy consumed to maintain coarser particles in motion for transport is not available to detachment the finer fractions of soil second the coarser sediments are looser compared to finer particles which include also silty and clayey fractions and the lack of resisting forces between particles as indicated by the tensile strength contributes to increase the detachment rate for medium to coarser sandy particles third the unit surface of the finer particles that is the area per unit weight or volume of soil is higher compared to the fractions of higher size and therefore the drag force act on higher surface of sediment decreasing shear stress therefore lower shear stress results in lower soil detachment this is again consistent with the literature which shows that in shallow surface flow the tensile strength and the bursting force of particles can affect the detachment rates e g nearing et al 1991 four also flow turbulence plays an important role in driving soil detachment coarser particles are subject to lower turbulence e g liu et al 2019 and this reduction hinders the ability of sediments of higher size to be lifted and flushed downstream by the water flow the rill detachment capacity measured in the experimental flume increased with water depth for all sediment classes and this can be explained by the increasing flow rates this is in accordance with other works nearing et al 1991 zhang et al 2002 who stated that soil detachment rates are a function of flow depth since particle detachment is more intense with increased flow rate and depth zhang et al 2002 moreover the higher the bed slope the higher is the rill detachment rate for all sediment classes and therefore also the soil slope plays an important role in driving the rill detachment rate however the equations of table 3 show that the effect of water depth on rill detachment capacity is lower at milder soil gradients compared to steeper soil at all sediment sizes as shown by the equation slopes increasing with bed slope presumably higher slopes increases the dragging forces on the soil particles exerted by the overland flow compared to soils with lower slopes which in contrast are less erodible in other words rill detachment is generally less sensitive to changes in flow depth than in slope gradient our results agree with zhang et al 2002 who highlighted the large influence of soil slope on the particle particularly at the higher gradients using a similar flume under the same soil slopes moreover the effect of flow depth on soil detachment rate is also dependent on slope gradient zhang et al 2002 the combined effect of water depth and bed slope on soil detachment capacity is analytically expressed by the shear stress which is proportional to the bed slope multiplied by the hydraulic radius which is in turn dependent on the flow depth about the modelling approach of this study several hydraulic parameters of overland flow are descriptors of water properties and this can be used to predict soil detachment capacity nearing et al 1991 several studies have tried to develop mathematical relations between hydraulic parameters and rill detachment capacity by overland flow zhang et al 2003 xiao et al 2017 li et al 2019 wu et al 2019 also in forest areas parhizkar et al 2020c parhizkar et al 2021b this study has confirmed that also in planted forestland the stream power and its unit value are better descriptors of rill detachment capacity compared to the other flow variables tested in the flume experiments mean velocity and energy and ω shows the best prediction capacity of rill detachment at all the investigated sediment size classes and particularly for the coarser size mean diameter higher than 1 5 mm this is close accordance with the collection of power regression models developed in the previous study by parhizkar et al 2021a which was carried out in the same forestland but without exploring the model accuracy for sediments of different size the very good prediction capacity of power equations based on unit stream power derives from the fact that this hydraulic parameter considers the flow velocity and soil slope at the same time and both the latter variables affect soil detachability due to the overland flow parhizkar et al 2020a in addition wang et al 2018 showed that the unit stream power as input of power functions is a reliable prediction of soil detachment capacity while zhang et al 2002 proposed other hydraulic parameters to model soil detachment process soil resistance to rill erosion can be estimated from the rill erodibility kr and critical shear stress τc nearing et al 1989 wang et al 2016 parhizkar et al 2020a and parhizkar et al 2021a have highlighted the linkage of these parameters to the rill detachment capacity compared to previous literature this study has focused the impacts of the sediment size classes on these two parameters in forestlands in this context the linear regressions between dc and τ must be individually developed for each sediment size class rather than for the whole soil samples and this specific modelling approach is consistent with the variability of rill detachment with sediment size that has been previously analyzed more equations with regression coefficients varying with slope and sediment size simulate better reflects the different effects that the drivers of rill detachment process previously identified i e flow energy sediment size unit surface of particles and flow turbulence play on soil erodibility due to concentrated flow in any case the high to extremely high coefficients of determination of the developed regression models show the high accuracy of these equations in predicting the rill erodibility and critical shear stress this result is consistent with the conclusions of zhang et al 2008 and parhizkar et al 2020a who reported the high accuracy in linear equations regressing dc and τ considering that kr and τc are two of the most important parameters reflecting soil resistance to rill erosion nearing et al 1989 the values of these variables proposed in this study can help modellers for accurate predictions of rill erosion in process based models that are very sensitive to reliable input geng et al 2017 wang et al 2016 knapen et al 2008 this study has shown that also kr and τc are highly variable with sediment size and slope of soil both increasing from finer to coarser classes and from milder to steeper profiles the increase in these parameters in sediment classes with size larger than 1 mm confirms the higher detachability of coarser soil fractions and of course high slope soils and again shows less resisting force between soil particles in these classes 5 conclusions this study has evaluated the influence of sediment size on rill detachment capacity of a reforested soil using an experimental flume at variable flow rates and bed slopes rill detachment capacity was significantly higher for sediments size over 1 mm compared to the other soil fractions this result has been explained by the combined effects of flow energy and turbulence as well as of particle size and unit surface moreover rill detachment capacity was more influenced by bed slope compared to water depth therefore the first working hypothesis of the current study significant variations of rill detachment capacity with sediment size can be confirmed power regression models were developed to assess the rill detachment capacity by hydraulic parameters for each sediment size class the unit stream power as input parameter of power equations is the best predictor of rill detachment at all the investigated particle size classes linear regression models between rill detachment capacity and shear stress were very accurate in predicting both rill erodibility and critical shear stress provided that these models are developed and calibrated separately for different sediment size classes of soil therefore also the second hypothesis of the current study need to consider the rill detachment variability with particle size can be confirmed the modelling approach of the study has again confirmed that soil particles with size higher than 1 mm have a lower resistance to rill erosion compared to the finer fractions overall the study is a contribution to a better understanding of a key process of soil erosion such as particle detachment on which particle size plays a high influence furthermore the results of the modelling activity propose values of the rill erodibility and critical shear stress to be used by land planners in process based erosion models credit authorship contribution statement

4317,rill detachment is the most important erosive process in steep slopes and its comprehension and prediction accuracy is important to properly develop soil conservation practices in forest areas this process is largely influenced by sediment size soil slope and water flow characteristics but the results of the studies that have explored these influences are contrasting this study has simulated in an experimental flume the rill detachment capacity dc of soil with five particle sizes 0 0 25 0 25 0 5 0 5 1 1 2 and 2 3 mm at five water flow rates 0 26 0 35 0 45 0 56 and 0 67 l m 1 s 1 and five bed slopes 3 5 9 1 19 2 29 1 and 38 3 on samples collected in a forestland of northern iran dc was significantly higher by 70 for sediments size over 1 mm compared to the other soil fractions and increased primarily with soil slope and secondarily with water depth a modelling approach has shown that the unit stream power is the best predictor of dc using power equations nse over 0 87 linear regression models between dc and shear stress τ were very accurate r2 over 0 80 with few exceptions in predicting both rill erodibility and critical shear stress when developed separately for each particle size class sediments with size higher than 1 mm had lower resistance to rill erosion compared to the finer fractions overall the study helps to better understand particle detachment of the erosion process on which particle size is a key parameter the modelling activity proposes to land planners values of the rill erodibility and critical shear stress of forested areas for applications in process based erosion models keywords shear stress rill erodibility plantation unit stream power rill erosion different sizes of sediment 1 introduction soil erosion is a severe threat for ecosystem health in many parts of the world rodrigo comino et al 2018 cerdà et al 2021 borrelli et al 2021 bezak et al 2021 in the water erosion process overland flow is the most important agent of particle detachment together with raindrop impact erosion in rills is dominant compared to laminar erosion in steep hillslopes moreover rill erosion is different between shallow or deep waters as well high low and high flow rates zhang et al 2002 soil detachment by shallow flow happens when the maximum force exerted by highly turbulent water is greater than the resistance between soil particles sediment size plays an important role in the soil detachment process since the particle dimensions influence the turbulence and detachability in sediment laden flow liu et al 2019 however the influence of sediment size in reducing or increasing soil detachment rates is sometimes contrasting in literature due to the different experimental conditions and the number of factors influencing particle detachment e g soil slope water flow rates sediment concentration for example ali et al 2012 and liu et al 2019 state that rill detachment is different from finer to coarser sediments the experimental results by ali et al 2012 showed that the flow velocity and therefore soil detachment decreases with increasing median grain size according to liu et al 2019 the sediment median size had a pronounced negative impact on the detachment rates similarly nearing et al 1991 found that the detachment rate of soils with coarse particles increases compared to finer soils conversely merten et al 2001 showed that detachment rate increases with decreasing sediment size thus more research is needed in order to clarify these waiving results of the literature studies rill detachment capacity may be even different in soils that although being of the same type and use and subjected to the same management are covered by different tree species parhizkar et al 2021a the root system of plants may influence soil aggregate stability and therefore soil detachment de baets et al 2006 moreover the rill detachment rates in reforested soils are significantly higher compared to the values measured in natural forests parhizkar et al 2021b therefore it is important to investigate the importance of sediment size on soil detachment in reforested soils when soil is planted with trees an accurate evaluation of the areas that are more exposed to rill erosion is essential in order to choose the most protective species pollen 2007 vannoppen et al 2015 vannoppen et al 2017 thus the estimation of soil detachment capacity together with the factors that influence this parameter is important to assess not only whether a soil is exposed to non tolerable erosion rates erosion models are useful tools to help land managers adopting the most effective anti erosive practices parhizkar et al 2021d many process based erosion models use soil detachment capacity as key input parameter nearing et al 1989 nearing et al 1999 li et al 2015 therefore accurate estimations of rill detachment capacity are essential to achieve reliable predictions in forest ecosystems that are prone to erosion this study has analysed the rill detachment capacity through flume experiments on soils sampled in a reforested area with steep slopes of northern iran more specifically we have i evaluated the impact of different sediment size on soil detachment rate at variable water flow rates and soil slopes and ii setup simple models to predict the soil detachment capacity and rill erodibility from hydraulic parameters for each studied sediment size we hypothesize that the rill detachment process is significantly variable with sediment size with higher detachability of coarser soil fractions and steeper soils and the prediction models developed in this study are able to take into account this variability 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experiments were conducted in the laboratory of soil physics at the guilan university iran on soil samples collected in the saqalaksar forestland park 37 09 24 n 49 31 50 e northern iran fig 1 the park is located in guilan province 15 km south of rasht city at an elevation of about 60 m above the mean sea level the climate conditions of the area are typically mediterranean csa type koppen geiger classification kottek et al 2006 with mean annual

in the park is large with a great variety of tree and shrub species mainly zelkova carpinifolia quercus castaneifolia alnus glutinosa parrotia persica pinus taeda and carpinus betulus 80 of the park area beside these natural species other species were planted in this forestland and then subjected to different management operations such as harvesting tree planting and fires parhizkar et al 2021c some of these management practices targeted to rehabilitation of this forestland have modified soil properties including soil detachment capacity parhizkar et al 2021a 2 2 soil sampling soil was randomly but uniformly sampled in different points of the experimental area about one samples each 2000 m2 fig 1 after sampling soil was transferred to the laboratory where each sample was separated into five sediment size classes i 0 0 25 mm clay silt and very fine to fine sand ii 0 25 0 5 mm medium sand iii 0 5 1 mm coarse sand iv 1 2 mm very coarse sand and v 2 3 mm gravel sieves with meshes

the experimental test was ended before this limit when a depth of 0 015 m of soil was eroded from the steel ring after the experiment the wet soil sample was oven dried and weighed the mean flow rate

measures in two cross sections of the flume using a level probe with accuracy of 1 mm parhizkar et al 2020a given the importance of water depth for the evaluation of dc the accuracy of this measure was further checked using a self made digital instrument in summary this device consisted of two sections of which the first was a printed circuit board pcb for the detection of the water level in the flume and the second contained a junction box and a led display dc was calculated as the mean value of the four replicates of each experiment at a given flow rate and bed gradient using eq 1 1 d c δ m

critical shear stress τc were clearly different for sediments of variable class and soil slopes kr generally increased with the mean diameter of the sediments although this increase was not always uniform fig 6 in addition τc increased with sediment diameter and soil slope also in this case not uniformly fig 7 4 discussion the influence of sediment size on soil detachment has been widely

al 2021a which was carried out in the same forestland but without exploring the model accuracy for sediments of different size the very good prediction capacity of power equations based on unit stream power derives from the fact that this hydraulic parameter considers the flow velocity and soil slope at the same time and both the latter variables affect soil detachability due to the overland flow parhizkar et al 2020a in addition wang et al 2018 showed that the unit stream power as input of power functions is a reliable prediction of soil detachment capacity while zhang et al 2002 proposed other hydraulic parameters to model soil detachment process soil resistance to rill erosion can be estimated from the rill erodibility kr and critical shear stress τc nearing et al 1989 wang et al 2016 parhizkar et al 2020a and parhizkar et al 2021a have highlighted the linkage of these parameters to the rill detachment capacity compared to previous literature this study has focused the impacts of the sediment size classes on these two parameters in forestlands in this context the linear regressions between dc and τ must be individually developed for each sediment size class rather than for the whole soil samples and this specific modelling approach is consistent with the variability of rill detachment with sediment size that has been previously analyzed more equations with regression coefficients varying with slope and sediment size simulate better reflects the different effects that the drivers of rill detachment process previously identified i e flow energy sediment size unit surface of particles and flow turbulence play on soil erodibility due to concentrated flow in any case the high to extremely high coefficients of determination of the developed regression models show the high accuracy of these equations in predicting the rill erodibility and critical shear stress this result is consistent with the conclusions of zhang et al 2008 and parhizkar et al 2020a who reported the high accuracy in linear equations regressing dc and τ considering that kr and τc are two of the most important parameters reflecting soil resistance to rill erosion nearing et al 1989 the values of these variables proposed in this study can help modellers for accurate predictions of rill erosion in process based models that are very sensitive to reliable input geng et al 2017 wang et al 2016 knapen et al 2008 this study has shown that also kr and τc are highly variable with sediment size and slope of soil both increasing from finer to coarser classes and from milder to steeper profiles the increase in these parameters in sediment classes with size larger than 1 mm confirms the higher detachability of coarser soil fractions and of course high slope soils and again shows less resisting force between soil particles in these classes 5 conclusions this study has evaluated the influence of sediment size on rill detachment capacity of a reforested soil using an experimental flume at variable flow rates and bed slopes rill detachment capacity was significantly higher for sediments size over 1 mm compared to the other soil fractions this result has been explained by the combined effects of flow energy and turbulence as well as of particle size and unit surface moreover rill detachment capacity was more influenced by bed slope compared to water depth therefore the first working hypothesis of the current study significant variations of rill detachment capacity with sediment size can be confirmed power regression models were developed to assess the rill detachment capacity by hydraulic parameters for each sediment size class the unit stream power as input parameter of power equations is the best predictor of rill detachment at all the investigated particle size classes linear regression models between rill detachment capacity and shear stress were very accurate in predicting both rill erodibility and critical shear stress provided that these models are developed and calibrated separately for different sediment size classes of soil therefore also the second hypothesis of the current study need to consider the rill detachment variability with particle size can be confirmed the modelling approach of the study has again confirmed that soil particles with size higher than 1 mm have a lower resistance to rill erosion compared to the finer fractions overall the study is a contribution to a better understanding of a key process of soil erosion such as particle detachment on which particle size plays a high influence furthermore the results of the modelling activity propose values of the rill erodibility and critical shear stress to be used by land planners in process based erosion models credit authorship contribution statement

4318,data assimilation techniques allow the integration of multi source data with physical modeling of dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl source zones to monitor their evolution in time and thereby improve remediation efforts the dnapl source zone is governed by multiphase physics and its architecture is usually highly irregular and nonstationary traditional data assimilation methods use stationary models to describe these nonstationary dnapl saturation fields leading to significant errors in the estimation of unknown source zone architectures szas in this study we propose a geostatistical data assimilation method to improve performance monitoring of dnapl remediation we estimate the dnapl sza after parameterizing the dnapl saturation field using a deep learning method instead of a stationary statistical model first we train a convolutional variational autoencoder cvae network to capture the physics of dnapl infiltration and depletion then we incorporate the cvae network within the ensemble kalman filter enkf to resolve the evolving dnapl sza by assimilating time lapse hydrogeophysical measurements i e oscillatory hydraulic tomography downgradient dissolved dnapl concentration and electrical resistivity tomography to assess the proposed cvae enkf framework s performance we conducted numerical experiments with evolving dnapl szas in a 2d heterogeneous aquifer results show that the proposed framework significantly improved dnapl saturation estimates throughout the source zone over time compared to the standard enkf method cvae enkf reduced the estimation error of dnapl mass remediated by 51 from enkf along with better predictions of source zone longevity it also better captured the morphology and center spread of mass of the evolving remediated portions of the source zone and provided better estimates of pooled dnapl mass furthermore the cvae enkf method is more stable and converges faster than enkf alone overall the proposed data assimilation framework can improve real time monitoring of dnapl remediation and risk analysis keywords dnapl remediation monitoring deep learning parameterization multi source data assimilation physically realistic constraint hydrogeophysics dnapl characterization 1 introduction the remediation of sites contaminated by dense nonaqueous phase liquids dnapls remains a significant environmental challenge national research council 2013 dnapls are a class of hazardous organic chemicals that includes chlorinated solvents creosote and coal tar once released to the subsurface dnapls follow a tortuous migration pathway penetrating the saturated zone as an oily phase in response to gravity and capillary forces pankow and cherry 1996 the subsurface distribution of dnapls is governed by many factors including the hydrogeological conditions at the specific site and the properties of the dnapl such as density solubility and interfacial tension as a result dnapl source zones szs exhibit a wide range of architectures from residual ganglia to laterally extensive pools on the locally low permeable media grant et al 2007 lenhard et al 1989 dnapl szs are persistent sources of groundwater contaminant and pose a significant risk to humans and ecosystems national research council 2013 various remediation methods have been developed and applied at dnapl contaminated sites such as fluid flushing and thermal chemical and biological reduction methods hadley and newell 2012 effective characterization of the dnapl source zone architecture sza before remediation as well as temporal monitoring of the sz during remediation plays a vital role in all aspects of site stewardship from remedial program design to remedial performance assessment and the effects of remediation on downstream plume evolution abriola et al 2012 kavanaugh et al 2003 several approaches exist to characterize dnapl szas and monitor their change during remediation utilizing various datasets including direct measurements from monitoring wells and membrane interface probes mips and indirect measurements by geophysical techniques itrc 2015 while each method has advantages and disadvantages integrating multiple data sources can improve characterization of the sz geostatistical inversion methods can integrate multi source datasets to provide an estimate of dnapl szas along with the associated uncertainty such methods gradually become more popular e g james et al 2000 yeh and zhu 2007 kang et al 2020 but significant challenges remain due to the complexity of multiphase physics and resulting dnapl architecture the dnapl saturation sn field is intricate and highly nonstationary which poses great difficulty for traditional geostatistical methods reed and minsker 2004 a nonstationary model is one in which the mean is not constant and or the covariance is not a function of only the separation kitanidis 1997 li et al 2007 when there are many data the classical gaussian stationary model is adequate lee et al 2016 however at real field sites data points are usually sparse so that the model regarding the structure of the sn field affects the accuracy of the sza characterization kang et al 2021 because the stationary prior model is physically unrealistic conventional geostatistical methods tend to produce oversmoothed sza estimates and miss features of variable characteristics e g dispersed ganglia lateral and vertical pools abriola et al 2012 arshadi et al 2020 for dynamic monitoring of dnapl sza e g during remediation the nonstationary nature of the sz persists and becomes more pronounced during dnapl mass depletion over smoothing of the estimated sz has more negative implications at later times of sz depletion when the szas become more complex e g multiple disconnected dnapl areas and elongated pools of different dimensions to handle the non stationarity of dnapl szas arshadi et al 2020 and koch and nowak 2016 accounted for the pertinent multiphase physics to generate possible sza realizations providing physically realistic constraints for the dnapl imaging problem their methods were designed for the interpolation problem i e conditioning on direct borehole data like local dnapl saturations and permeabilities and are not directly applicable to imaging using indirect data at field sites where direct data are limited estimation relies on indirect data e g hydraulic head and geophysical data that are also more inexpensive to collect kang et al 2020 in an estimation method using indirect data kang et al 2021 trained a convolutional variational autoencoder cvae kingma and welling 2014 using dnapl sza realizations generated from multiphase modeling to provide a physically based representation of the sn field the cvae network was then integrated with an ensemble smoother es to formulate a joint inversion framework cvae es for sza imaging combining the information from both the physically based prior and the indirect data the cvae es method accurately reconstructed the steady state sza kang et al 2021 in this study we extend the work of kang et al 2021 to real time monitoring of dnapl sza with time dependent state variables i e dnapl saturation sn and effective hydraulic conductivity keff we first employ the cvae to parameterize the sn and k fields during dnapl remediation capturing dnapl sz patterns as the sz is evolving and its spatial characteristics are changing we then combine the cvae network with the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 a geostatistical data assimilation method the enkf is used to estimate sn and keff fields temporal evolution by inverting oscillatory hydraulic tomography oht downgradient aqueous phase dnapl concentration and electrical resistivity tomography ert measurements the proposed data assimilation framework cvae enkf is applied to two different dnapl szas one pool dominated and one residual dominated undergoing remediation in a heterogeneous aquifer the dnapl szas are estimated sequentially at selected time intervals representing early mid and long term remediation phases thereby providing significantly different spatial patterns from connected dnapl szs to multiple disconnected dnapl areas we investigate both the estimation accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed cvae enkf method compared to the traditional enkf method finally we summarize the proposed method s applicability and benefits for long term monitoring of evolving dnapl szas 2 methodology in this section we describe the forward numerical models used to generate the dnapl sz realizations and the synthetic data for our study section 2 1 and the data assimilation framework used to invert the data and characterize the evolving dnapl sza section 2 2 2 1 forward modeling 2 1 1 dnapl infiltration and dissolution model for synthetic dnapl sz generation synthetic dnapl szas are generated by a fast stochastic invasion percolation sip algorithm adapted from ewing and berkowitz 1998 and described in koch and nowak 2015 the sip algorithm simulates dnapl infiltration by modeling invasion into each model cell according to its entry pressure as a result dnapl infiltration into cells and the final sza are controlled by effective permeabilities of each cell as well as a stochastic component that accounts for unresolved variability in pore scale properties the sip algorithm can generate elaborate and tortuous szas that are physically consistent with the underlying permeability field koch and nowak 2015 after dnapl infiltration the dnapl szs were assumed to be immobile and to change only due to dnapl dissolution in the post infiltration phase further infiltration was ignored and only dnapl dissolution due to advection and lateral dispersion was modeled detwiler et al 2009 starting with the dnapl szs produced by the sip algorithm t 0 the mass flux from the dnapl to the aqueous phase was simulated by the rate at which the solute at the interface boundary equal to the solubility concentration cs of the dnapl was removed by advective dispersive transport no reaction was considered to generate the evolving dnapl sz realizations however using sz realizations that include reaction e g chemical oxidation and bioremediation as in real dnapl contaminated sites can still be accommodated without any change to the proposed data assimilation algorithm the transport of dissolved dnapl was simulated with an adapted particle tracking random walk ptrw model koch and nowak 2014 koch and nowak 2015 given that the dnapl mass depletion can influence the groundwater flow through changes in relative permeabilities a few updates of the flow field and the ptrw simulations were required during the dnapl depletion modeling koch and nowak 2015 describe in detail the ptrw algorithm for fast dnapl depletion simulations in this study we applied the sip dnapl infiltration and ptrw dnapl depletion algorithms to generate the synthetic data for the temporal evolution of sn and corresponding effective hydraulic conductivity keff fields before and during the dnapl remediation phase we then divided these generated sn and keff fields into two parts the first part was used as training samples for the convolutional variational autoencoder cvae network and the second part was used as reference fields for the data assimilation experiments the reference fields were then used to produce the indirect hydrogeophysical data see section 2 1 2 for the data assimilation and compare with the estimated dnapl szs when evaluating the cvae enkf method 2 1 2 groundwater flow transport model and geoelectrical model for synthetic indirect data generation as discussed we assumed that the final sza generated by sip in the dnapl infiltration phase has reached equilibrium and no further infiltration takes place after t 0 the dnapl acting as an immobile contaminant source in the subsurface see kang et al 2021 therefore single phase models were used to simulate three types of hydrogeophysical datasets for each quasi static sn field that was imaged downgradient dissolved dnapl concentrations oht derived pressures and ert derived potentials e g aghasi et al 2013 kang et al 2021 yeh and zhu 2007 the presence of the dnapl was factored in the groundwater flow model through the effective aqueous hydraulic conductivity keff ki kr sn where ki and kr denote the intrinsic and relative hydraulic conductivity respectively therefore the hydraulic head data h from oht was governed by keff while the downgradient dnapl concentration data c was governed by both the keff and sn the electrical potential data v from ert was directly controlled by sn we assumed that the background soil matrix is nonclayey and we did not consider any correlation between hydraulic conductivity and electrical conductivity following archie s law a well established hydraulic electric petrophysical relationship used to link the sn with the electrical conductivity σ archie 1942 archie s law postulates that the soil matrix is non conductive nonclayey and that only electrolytic conduction of the fluids within the pore space contributes to σ the groundwater flow model the aqueous phase dnapl transport model and the geoelectrical forward model were all solved in comsol multiphysics multiphysics 1994 to obtain the oht downgradient dnapl concentration and ert measurements respectively during the dnapl remediation phase for details on the governing equations for these hydrogeophysical forward models please refer to the appendix 2 2 data assimilation framework cvae enkf in this study we used ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 as the data assimilation method to estimate the temporal evolution of sn and keff fields using indirect data to handle the non stationarity of the sn we modified the standard enkf method to cvae enkf which utilizes the cvae to parameterize the sn keff fields into a normally distributed low dimensional latent space kang et al 2021 the enkf is an algorithm to implement kalman filtering for large dimensional systems it uses an ensemble of realizations to represent efficiently the covariance matrix of the state of a dynamic system and assimilate available measurements data enkf can also be adapted to estimate static unknown model parameters schöniger et al 2012 in this study we estimated sn and keff as the unknown state variables at several data assimilation times each time using previously described hydrogeophysical measurements i e c h and v as data the iterative enkf is a variant of enkf for nonlinear estimation problems and was utilized here enkf is summarized in algorithm 1 chen and oliver 2012 algorithm 1 ensemble kalman filter as utilized in this study x i t represents the x vector of unknowns at time t for the i th iteration require d obs t measurements at time t x 0 t 0 the initial ensemble of unknown states at t 0 1 for t t 0 to t 10 2

random walk model 11 end for 12 x post x post t 0 x post t 10 13 return x post at the initial time t 0 ne realizations of state fields were produced with a prior distribution i e x 0 t 0 the subscript 0 represents the 0th iteration the vector of state variables at time t can be defined as 1 x t s n t l n k e f f t t where sn t and keff t represent the dnapl saturation and effective hydraulic conductivity fields at time t respectively for each time step t we applied iterative optimization to maximize the posterior probability of the updated state variables conditioning on the measurements and their differences between simulated data emerick reynolds 2013 ghorbanidehno et al 2020 gu and oliver 2007 the x i t in algorithm 1 represents the x vector at time t for the i th iteration based on the x i t we can obtain the corresponding simulated measurement vector d i t through the hydrogeophysical models g described in section 2 1 2 which includes the hydraulic head h from oht downgradient dnapl concentration c and electrical potential v from ert then we updated the state vector x i t through eq 2 step 7 of algorithm 1 2 x i 1 t x i t c xd i t c dd i t c d t 1 d obs t d i t where c xd i t is the cross covariance matrix between the state vector i e x i t and the simulated data i e d i t at time t for the i th iteration c dd i t is the covariance matrix of the simulated data both c xd i t and c dd i t are computed from the ensemble statistics c d t corresponds to the error covariance matrix of the measurements and d obs t is the vector of measured data at time t for each data assimilation step we iteratively updated the state vector x t using eq 2 until one of the following termination criteria was met i number of iterations 10 ii root mean square error rmse between the simulated data d t and measurements d obs t was less than the threshold predefined according to the measurement error and iii the improvement in data fit i e the rmse between the simulated data and measurements was less than 5 between two adjacent iteration steps emerick reynolds 2013 through iterations we can obtain the posterior ensemble x post t at time t subsequently we used the forward model f to propagate the x vector to the next time step i e from x t to x t 1 and utilized the obtained x t 1 vector as the prior ensemble for the next time step the random walk model was used as f to propagate the sn and keff in time since the did not significantly change in adjacent time steps see figure s2 and s3 in supporting information e g vauhkonen et al 1998 nenna et al 2011 li et al 2014 soueid ahmed et al 2019 the aforementioned procedure was repeated for each data assimilation step every 5 years of physical time see figures s2 and s3 until the last time step t 10 in algorithm 1 providing the estimate of the temporal evolution of sn and keff the data assimilation used in the iterative enkf described above is most accurate when the prior distribution of x is gaussian however the highly nonstationary sn fields violate such a gaussian assumption directly employing the standard enkf method to update the sn fields may fail to produce physically realistic estimates of dnapl szas e g li et al 2017 thus in this study we used the convolutional variational autoencoder cvae kingma and welling 2014 to map the non stationary state variables x sn ln keff t to normally distributed latent variables z that we update thus satisfying the gaussian assumption of enkf cvae will be presented in more detail below after the modified data assimilation framework is presented fig 1 illustrates the proposed cvae enkf framework first we trained the cvae network on a set of keff and sn realizations generated by the sip ptrw algorithm see section 2 1 1 this way the cvae network can capture the features of the highly irregular sz patterns as the sz is evolving over time once the cvae training process was finished fig 1 a the cvae s decoder was used within the data assimilation process described below to generate physically realistic sn and keff realizations from latent variables z after cvae training the sn and keff fields were estimated using the following procedure fig 1 b 1 start with an initial guess of the latent vector ensemble sampled from n 0 i 2 generate the corresponding sn and keff fields at time t through the trained cvae decoder taking the latent vector z t as input 3 run the hydrogeophysical forward model described in section 2 1 2 to obtain the simulated measurements i e ht ct and vt for each realization 4 update the latent vectors z t using the iterative enkf until the termination criterion is reached algorithm 1 where x is replaced by z 5 propagate z t forward to the next time step z t 1 using the random walk model 6 repeat 2 5 procedure until the last time step and 7 reconstruct estimated latent variables z to final estimates of x sn ln keff t the cvae neural network which was used as a parameterization method for keff and nonstationary sn fields falls into the category of generative models in machine learning see goodfellow et al 2016 as it can generate realizations with complex probability distributions in high dimensional spaces fig 1 a shows the cvae structure the cvae can parameterize the high dimensional fields into a low dimensional latent space retaining only the most important features of the spatial distributions of the unknowns more detail on the cvae parameterization method is provided by canchumuni et al 2019 and kang et al 2021 in cvae training we posed the sn reconstruction problem as a classification task to represent the highly nonstationary sn fields we binned the sn values into three categories i e sn 0 0 sn 0 2 and sn 0 2 corresponding to no dnapl subregions low saturation subregions ganglia and high saturation subregions pools respectively the threshold sn 0 2 was selected based on previous literature values e g christ et al 2010 gerhard and kueper 2003 this binning strategy allowed the analysis to focus on the relative spatial distribution of ganglia and pooled dnapl rather than the detailed sn values and reduced the uncertainty of the unknowns following this strategy see figure s1 in supporting information we quantized the sn values into discrete categories and then converted them into three probability maps the input images in figure s1 for the cvae training process in summary the cvae network receives one k map and three sn probability maps the encoder maps these four maps to z and the decoder reconstructs the k map and sn probability maps taking z as input then based on the probability maps the most likely sn is chosen as the reconstructed sn 3 synthetic case study design 3 1 synthetic source zone architectures and network training two 2d numerical experiments in the x z plane with differing types of sza were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods for monitoring a dnapl sz during the remediation process see fig 2 a pool dominated sza and a residual dominated sza were considered in which the initial ganglia to pool gtp ratios were 0 61 and 2 17 respectively gtp ratios are the ratio of the volume of napl present at or below residual saturation divided by the volume present at saturations greater than residual saturation christ et al 2006 to generate these two different dnapl szas we used different parameters i e covariance kernels of ki dnapl release rates and location of spill points in experiment 2 compared to experiment 1 all parameters used in the experiments are summarized in table 1 we conducted numerical experiments for a 2d confined aquifer 40 m 20 m which was discretized into 80 40 3200 grid blocks with the length of each block being 0 5 m δx δz 0 5 m synthetic intrinsic hydraulic conductivity ki fields were generated by a spectral based gaussian generation method dietrich and newsam 1993 using the geostatistical parameters in table 1 based on the reference ki field we used the sip algorithm to model dnapl infiltration and obtain the initial dnapl sza i e pre remediation phase t 0 year during the remediation phase t 0 year an imposed hydraulic gradient of 0 01 was applied which was higher than the ambient gradient to promote enhanced dissolution of the dnapl sz the total simulation time for dnapl remediation under this hydraulic gradient was 50 years and there are 11 equally spaced time points i e t 0 5 10 50 years the sip ptrw model was used to generate the spatial distributions of sn and keff at the chosen time steps the resulting reference sn and keff fields are shown in fig 2 and the complete temporal evolution of sn and keff are detailed in figures s2 and s3 the cvae was used to parameterize the sn and keff fields the architecture of the cvae network is shown in fig 1 a and detailed in table s1 the training data for the cvae were keff images and the corresponding sn probability images the training samples consisted of 30 000 sets of sn and keff sequences generated by the sip ptrw model each sequence comprised of 11 pairs of sn and keff images corresponding to the 11 time steps t 0 5 10 50 years to evaluate the cvae network s performance we generated another 3 000 testing sets that were not included in the training sets obtaining these 33 000 sets took 18 h using 20 cpus in parallel note that at most field sites the location of dnapl release points x 0 release rates v 0 and total release mass m 0 would be unknown thus we treated them as random variables when generating training samples i e x0 10 30 m x 0 ranges from x 0 10 m to x 0 30 m see the possible dnapl release area in fig 3 a ν0 3 10 6 7 10 6 m3 s m0 3 7 tons the ranges of v 0 and m 0 were referred to in previous studies on dnapl contaminant modeling koch and nowak 2015 koch and nowak 2016 maji et al 2006 we trained two different cvae networks for experiments 1 and 2 respectively we trained these networks on certain simulated geological formations gaussian or exponential covariance that can be inferred from the field borehole log data it is theoretically possible to train a single network to capture the szas in any geological formation by including more sza realizations generated from different geological formations as training data here we separately trained two networks for two experiments the training for each experiment took 11 7 h the latent space dimension was chosen as 400 which was referred to in previous study on steady state sn field reconstruction kang et al 2021 the reconstruction performance of the cvae was measured using the normalized root mean square error nrmse which can be defined as 3 nrmse 1 x max x min 1 n te j 1 n te x j x j 2 2 where nte is the number of the testing samples and and x are the actual and reconstructed vector of ln keff or sn respectively x max and x min are the maximum and minimum value of keff sn for in the testing set respectively 3 2 measurement data collection for the synthetic cases to monitor the remediation process of the dnapl szs four fully penetrating boreholes were set in the hypothetical aquifer fig 3 a each borehole had 20 pressure sampling ports except the downgradient borehole that also included 20 additional concentration sampling ports x 40 m z 1 2 20 m see the blue rectangle in fig 3 a to record the electrical potential anomalies caused by the presence of dnapl 80 ert electrodes were set in the boreholes and 41 electrodes were installed at the top aquifer aquitard contact fig 3 b for the groundwater flow model no flux boundary conditions bcs were imposed at the top and bottom of the aquifer while constant hydraulic head bcs were assigned to the two sides resulting in a mean hydraulic gradient of 0 01 this hydraulic gradient represented engineered groundwater pumping across the sza for the geoelectrical model insulation bcs were imposed at the top and bottom of the domain while zero potential bcs were fixed on the sides prior to the start of remediation at t 0 year 20 downgradient dissolved dnapl concentrations 3792 oht derived pressures and 944 ert derived potentials were collected to characterize the sza and keff because the cost of applying oht at a field site is relatively high we assumed the oht data was only available at t 0 year conversely less costly downgradient concentration sampling and ert were applied before and during the remediation phase i e t 0 5 10 50 years a gaussian error with zero mean and the standard deviation of 0 001 g l 1 v and 0 01 m was added to the synthetic measurements i e c v and h the noise for v corresponded to 2 5 of the maximum electrical potential change as done in previous studies e g camporese et al 2015 pollock and cirpka 2010 to illustrate the advantage of the cvae parameterization in estimating the unknown dynamic of the sza we compared the standard enkf method without cvae parameterization and the cvae enkf method the comparison was conducted for a pool dominated sza enkf pool and cvae enkf pool and a residual dominated sza enkf residual and cvae enkf residual see table 2 for the standard enkf method to constrain estimated sn values within the range 0 1 we used the transformed saturation s as the unknown state variable be estimated in enkf which was distributed over and was defined as follows james et al 2000 4 s ln s n 1 s n s n e s 1 e s equation 4 posed a soft constraint on sn values once updated by the enkf the s was then transformed back to original sn values for the hydrogeophysical forward model run since we applied a binning strategy for cvae enkf see figure s1 a similar binning approach was employed in the standard enkf for a fair comparison i e the estimated sn was discretized into three classes i e sn 0 0 2 0 4 by binning continuous sn values with upper level limits as 0 2 and 0 4 for the cvae enkf method the unknowns to be estimated were the normally distributed low dimensional latent variables z the estimated z was subsequently transformed back to sn by the decoder no other transformation was required different strategies were used to generate the initial keff and sn ensemble for the standard enkf and cvae enkf for the standard enkf we generated the initial ensemble using sip ptrw with random x 0 location of dnapl release points v 0 release rates and m 0 total release mass i e x0 10 30 m ν0 3 10 6 7 10 6 m3 s m0 3 7 tons for the cvae enkf the initial keff and sn ensemble was directly generated from the cvae s decoder given an ensemble of latent vectors z n 0 i as input for all four cases the number of the time steps nt and the ensemble size ne of the enkf method was nt 11 and ne 500 respectively the number of iterations for different cases was listed in table 3 and will be discussed later in section 4 3 all the case settings of experiments 1 and 2 were the same except for the reference sn and keff fields see fig 2 the simulations were run on a linux workstation equipped with 24 intel cores 2 5 ghz processors and 256 gb ram 4 results 4 1 experiment 1 application to pool dominated dnapl sza 4 1 1 accuracy of szas parameterized by the cvae the parameterization results for nonstationary sn and keff fields are shown in fig 4 it illustrates the cvae s reconstruction of a randomly chosen sn keff realization in the testing set more realizations are shown in figure s4 note that the cvae successfully reproduced the pattern of the sz and the corresponding keff fields during the remediation phase the reconstruction accuracy evaluated on the testing sets was nrmses 0 14 and nrmsek 0 076 in the sn and keff fields respectively in addition the sn and keff fields reconstructed from cvae can clearly reflect the sn keff interdependence i e high saturations correspond to low effective conductivities extending the previous study by kang et al 2021 the cvae network in this study can capture significantly different sz spatial patterns as the sz is evolving during the remediation process from connected dnapl szs to multiple disconnected dnapl areas the satisfactory performance was achieved at the one time cost of training the cvae using time lapse images this improved cvae network trained for monitoring dnapl szs has broader utility for real field applications with dnapl contaminated sites varying from fresh to aged szs and a wide range of aquifer and sz heterogeneity the cvae network is an effective parameterization approach for physically realistic sn and keff fields during remediation 4 1 2 estimation of dnapl szas and hydraulic conductivity fields figs 5 and 6 demonstrate the ensemble mean and standard deviation std of the estimated sn and keff fields from the enkf pool and cvae enkf pool cases figure s5 depicts two realizations from the posterior distributions from enkf and cvae enkf the posterior mean sn estimated from enkf can roughly locate the highly saturated dnapl regions sn 0 2 but cannot resolve the extent and shape of the reference sz at different time steps fig 5 in particular the enkf overestimated the dnapl area at later time steps e g t 30 50 years this poor performance can be explained by the posterior realizations shown in figure s4 the enkf generated some degenerate posterior sn realizations which were far from the reference sn field this is because of the significant deviation of the prior stationary assumption used in the standard enkf from physical reality i e nonstationary sn distribution for the keff estimated with the standard enkf fig 6 the posterior estimate gradually moved away from the reference keff field during the data assimilation process due to the low sensitivity of data i e ert and downgradient dnapl concentration to keff also the standard enkf failed to capture the sn keff interdependence see figs 5 and 6 due to the independently generated prior distributions for sn and keff in contrast the proposed cvae enkf framework better characterized the pre remediation sza t 0 year see fig 5 and better reproduced the evolution of the sn field during remediation t 0 year see fig 5 this is because i the cvae s decoder ensured that each realization honored the physics of dnapl infiltration and depletion remediation see figure s5 and ii the cvae parameterized the nonstationary sn field into the latent vector z n 0 i which satisfied the stationarity assumption of the enkf method thus avoiding degenerate realizations furthermore the cvae enkf successfully reproduced the temporal changes of the keff field during dnapl remediation and accurately captured the sn keff interdependence see figs 5 and 6 the advantages of the cvae enkf can also be observed in fig 7 which shows the nrmse for sn and keff fields for all timesteps for the two methods for field site applications the sn standard deviation std maps fig 5 can be used to quantify uncertainty and help design an optimal sampling strategy providing statistically favorable locations for additional monitoring boreholes e g sreekanth et al 2017 overall the uncertainty of sn produced by the enkf was higher than that from cvae enkf because the physically based prior provided by cvae is more informative than the stationary prior used in enkf besides the enkf derived std maps showed more spurious artifacts see the artifacts near the boundary of the domain figure s5 4 1 3 remedial performance evaluation in addition to delineating the morphology of the dnapl sz the following questions are also critical for remedial performance evaluation 1 how much dnapl mass has been remediated 2 where should remediation efforts be concentrated i e where are the remaining dnapl szs 3 how long will it take to clean up the remaining dnapl mass in the sz to further compare the performance of enkf and cvae enkf in these three aspects we compared six sn spatial metrics between the estimated and the reference szas during the remediation phase fig 8 1 the evolution of total dnapl mass remaining in the sz fig 8 a can serve as a quantifiable measurement for remedial effectiveness and efficiency itrc 2004 the reference rate of dnapl mass depletion decreased over time as expected since the most accessible dnapl subregions i e residual dnapl were gradually depleted the evolution of dnapl mass estimated from the enkf failed to reproduce the reference mass depletion at both early and later times in contrast the cvae enkf can satisfactorily estimate the reference evolution of dnapl mass although the remaining dnapl mass was still overestimated at later times i e up to 61 overestimation during t 30 to 50 years this overestimation would be reduced if instead of the random walk model to propagate sn to the next time step a numerical transport model was used to propagate the saturations in time i e function f in algorithm 1 however additional transport modeling comes at a higher computational cost the average value of the remaining dnapl mass error in cvae enkf estimation 0 46 tons was also remarkably lower by 51 than the corresponding error in enkf 0 93 tons 2 the location where dnapl mass remains and where remediation efforts should be concentrated can be reflected in the changes in and z center of the sz and the spread of dnapl mass fig 8 b 8c 8e and 8f fig 8 b and 8c indicate that the cvae enkf better reproduced the first spatial moments i e x and z center of mass than the standard enkf for the second spatial moments fig 8 e and 8f the enkf clearly overestimated the dnapl extent in the direction and underestimated the extent in the z direction which is also indicated in fig 5 t 30 and 50 years in contrast the cvae enkf more accurately reproduced the temporal evolution of the and z spread of mass 3 the mass of pooled dnapl mp and residual dnapl mr controls the dnapl dissolution behavior and can therefore serve as useful metrics to predict sz longevity and to analyze how long the remedial program will take to reach its goal abriola et al 2012 christ et al 2006 fig 8 d shows the mp estimated from the enkf and cvae enkf note that cvae enkf better reproduced the evolution of mp compared with enkf however cvae enkf underestimated the mp at early times i e t 0 15 years since the three categories sn 0 0 2 0 4 used in sn reconstruction failed to reproduce highly saturated area sn 0 4 using more categories can improve the reconstruction performance which would increase the computational effort in network training despite the successful performance of the cvae enkf in monitoring the dnapl remediation there was still a deviation of the cvae enkf obtained szas from the reference and two major sources of errors i e false positive and false negative errors existed false positive error corresponds to estimating positive sn in a region where no dnapl exists while false negative corresponds to a failure to estimate a positive dnapl in a region where dnapl exists the overestimated underestimated dnapl mass from false positives negatives for the enkf pool and cvae enkf pool cases are shown in table s2 from a remediation perspective false negatives may lead to missing an entire portion of the dnapl sz and not employing necessary remediation at some contaminated regions in contrast false positives may result in overdesigning remedial programs fig 9 demonstrates that the cvae enkf produced fewer false positives and false negatives than the standard enkf 4 2 experiment 2 application to residual dominated dnapl sza next the performance of the proposed framework cva enkf was evaluated for a residual dominated sza fig 3 the imaging of residual dnapl with the proposed hydrogeophysical data is more challenging because of the low sensitivity of the ert signals to low dnapl saturations e g power et al 2014 4 2 1 accuracy of szas parameterized by the cvae fig 10 illustrates the cvae s reconstruction of a randomly chosen sn keff realization in the testing set the cvae successfully reproduced the evolution of sn and keff during the dnapl remediation and can capture the sn keff interdependence even at these lower saturations the reconstruction accuracy evaluated on the testing sets was nrmses 0 11 and nrmsek 0 061 in the sn and keff fields respectively 4 2 2 estimation of dnapl szas and hydraulic conductivity fields fig 11 and figure s6 illustrate the posterior ensemble mean and standard deviation of the estimated sn and keff fields for the enkf residual and cvae enkf residual cases both methods roughly captured the temporal evolution of the reference sza fig 11 still they failed to capture the dnapl in deeper regions due to the lower sensitivity of ert at depth power et al 2014 to improve the monitoring resolution in deeper regions one can incorporate additional datasets in the proposed framework such as partitioning tracer tests yeh and zhu 2007 kang et al 2020 and ert with surface to horizontal borehole arrays power et al 2015 4 2 3 remedial performance evaluation to further compare the ability of these two data assimilation methods to evaluate remedial performance we calculated the nrmse of sn and six sn spatial metrics using the estimated szas at different times see figs 12 and 13 fig 12 shows that the cvae enkf performed slightly better than standard enkf on average i e in terms of the nrmses since the cvae enkf can incorporate information from both the physically based prior provided by cvae parameterization and the hydrogeophysical measurements fig 13 indicates the results from cvae enkf were better than results from enkf for total dnapl mass mass of dnapl pools and spatial moments in the x and z directions cvae enkf outperformed enkf regarding pool dominated sz although the differences were less pronounced for the residual dominated sz for source zones that combine pools and residual zones we expect the estimation performance is between the one for the two experiments presented here with cvae enkf outperforming enkf for the aforementioned reasons 4 3 computational efficiency and convergence the computational effort required by the data assimilation methods presented here can be significant for large domains and the nonlinear dependence between the unknowns in consecutive steps and between the unknowns and the data can lead to difficulties in convergence of the optimization problem of matching the measurements potentially leading to failure to reach an acceptable final estimate such difficulties are expected to be alleviated when using a more appropriate prior like the cvae based prior utilized in the proposed method increasing the robustness and reducing the computational cost of the data assimilation the computational time and number of iterations needed to reach convergence over the whole data assimilation process are summarized in table 3 as expected compared with the standard enkf the cvae enkf reached convergence in fewer iterations this is because the iteration process in cvae enkf was constrained by both the measurements and the physically based prior while the iteration process in enkf was mainly constrained by the measurements with a less informative prior as a result the cvae enkf and the enkf required four and seven iterations respectively to reach convergence at t 0 year figure s7 moreover the cvae enkf method estimated the sn field more accurately by using fewer iterations 5 conclusions in this study we modified a well established data assimilation framework enkf to improve the accuracy of dnapl estimation from multi source indirect hydrogeophysical data the proposed cvae enkf framework provides a physically based prior distribution for dnapl saturations improving both the estimation of the evolving dnapl sza and related remediation metrics during the remediation process therefore cvae enkf exhibits strong potential as a high resolution approach for monitoring dnapl remediation two numerical experiments in a 2d heterogenous aquifer with significantly different szas i e pool dominated and residual dominated demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data assimilation framework for monitoring the evolution of dnapl szs as the sz architecture is changing during remediation results show that compared with the traditional enkf without the cvae parameterization the proposed cvae enkf framework can i more accurately capture the evolving dnapl sza and the sz metrics e g spatial moments of the sz during remediation ii reduce the estimation error of remaining dnapl mass by 51 and iii reach convergence using less computational effort i e fewer iterations the proposed cvae enkf method outperforms enkf because it captures the physics of dnapl infiltration depletion by using data from multiphase modeling to train the cvae network resulting in higher accuracy and also because the cvae normally distributed low dimensional latent vectors used in place of the nonstationary high dimensional sn fields in enkf satisfy the stationary assumption of enkf resulting in a more robust estimation in our synthetic cases cvae enkf overestimated the remaining dnapl mass at the end of remediation not as much as enkf but by up to 61 which was related to the approximation error from the random walk model during data assimilation process and the failure to reproduce highly saturated dnapl area by using only three categories in sn reconstruction the method can be extended and further improved by using transport modeling to approximate the sn dynamics and by using more categories in sn reconstruction however higher computational cost would be required for data assimilation and network training the proposed cvae enkf framework is highly promising for improved monitoring of the changes of dnapl szs during site remediation which is critical for optimizing the remedial strategy and site operations since the method can utilize both the physically based prior distribution of dnapl saturations and field measurements it may achieve high resolution estimation of dnapl szas even with sparse indirect data furthermore existing enkf algorithms can be adapted to include the cvae informed prior without intrusive code modifications the prior generation could be further optimized to improve sza reconstruction by adopting recently developed deep generative models such as generative adversarial networks goodfellow et al 2014 zhong et al 2020 future work will further explore the effectiveness of the proposed data assimilation framework through controlled sandbox experiments and or pilot tests of dnapl

the time scale for solute migration can be orders of magnitude smaller than that for changes in sza and flow conditions around and through the sz koch and nowak 2015 also we assume local chemical

4318,data assimilation techniques allow the integration of multi source data with physical modeling of dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl source zones to monitor their evolution in time and thereby improve remediation efforts the dnapl source zone is governed by multiphase physics and its architecture is usually highly irregular and nonstationary traditional data assimilation methods use stationary models to describe these nonstationary dnapl saturation fields leading to significant errors in the estimation of unknown source zone architectures szas in this study we propose a geostatistical data assimilation method to improve performance monitoring of dnapl remediation we estimate the dnapl sza after parameterizing the dnapl saturation field using a deep learning method instead of a stationary statistical model first we train a convolutional variational autoencoder cvae network to capture the physics of dnapl infiltration and depletion then we incorporate the cvae network within the ensemble kalman filter enkf to resolve the evolving dnapl sza by assimilating time lapse hydrogeophysical measurements i e oscillatory hydraulic tomography downgradient dissolved dnapl concentration and electrical resistivity tomography to assess the proposed cvae enkf framework s performance we conducted numerical experiments with evolving dnapl szas in a 2d heterogeneous aquifer results show that the proposed framework significantly improved dnapl saturation estimates throughout the source zone over time compared to the standard enkf method cvae enkf reduced the estimation error of dnapl mass remediated by 51 from enkf along with better predictions of source zone longevity it also better captured the morphology and center spread of mass of the evolving remediated portions of the source zone and provided better estimates of pooled dnapl mass furthermore the cvae enkf method is more stable and converges faster than enkf alone overall the proposed data assimilation framework can improve real time monitoring of dnapl remediation and risk analysis keywords dnapl remediation monitoring deep learning parameterization multi source data assimilation physically realistic constraint hydrogeophysics dnapl characterization 1 introduction the remediation of sites contaminated by dense nonaqueous phase liquids dnapls remains a significant environmental challenge national research council 2013 dnapls are a class of hazardous organic chemicals that includes chlorinated solvents creosote and coal tar once released to the subsurface dnapls follow a tortuous migration pathway penetrating the saturated zone as an oily phase in response to gravity and capillary forces pankow and cherry 1996 the subsurface distribution of dnapls is governed by many factors including the hydrogeological conditions at the specific site and the properties of the dnapl such as density solubility and interfacial tension as a result dnapl source zones szs exhibit a wide range of architectures from residual ganglia to laterally extensive pools on the locally low permeable media grant et al 2007 lenhard et al 1989 dnapl szs are persistent sources of groundwater contaminant and pose a significant risk to humans and ecosystems national research council 2013 various remediation methods have been developed and applied at dnapl contaminated sites such as fluid flushing and thermal chemical and biological reduction methods hadley and newell 2012 effective characterization of the dnapl source zone architecture sza before remediation as well as temporal monitoring of the sz during remediation plays a vital role in all aspects of site stewardship from remedial program design to remedial performance assessment and the effects of remediation on downstream plume evolution abriola et al 2012 kavanaugh et al 2003 several approaches exist to characterize dnapl szas and monitor their change during remediation utilizing various datasets including direct measurements from monitoring wells and membrane interface probes mips and indirect measurements by geophysical techniques itrc 2015 while each method has advantages and disadvantages integrating multiple data sources can improve characterization of the sz geostatistical inversion methods can integrate multi source datasets to provide an estimate of dnapl szas along with the associated uncertainty such methods gradually become more popular e g james et al 2000 yeh and zhu 2007 kang et al 2020 but significant challenges remain due to the complexity of multiphase physics and resulting dnapl architecture the dnapl saturation sn field is intricate and highly nonstationary which poses great difficulty for traditional geostatistical methods reed and minsker 2004 a nonstationary model is one in which the mean is not constant and or the covariance is not a function of only the separation kitanidis 1997 li et al 2007 when there are many data the classical gaussian stationary model is adequate lee et al 2016 however at real field sites data points are usually sparse so that the model regarding the structure of the sn field affects the accuracy of the sza characterization kang et al 2021 because the stationary prior model is physically unrealistic conventional geostatistical methods tend to produce oversmoothed sza estimates and miss features of variable characteristics e g dispersed ganglia lateral and vertical pools abriola et al 2012 arshadi et al 2020 for dynamic monitoring of dnapl sza e g during remediation the nonstationary nature of the sz persists and becomes more pronounced during dnapl mass depletion over smoothing of the estimated sz has more negative implications at later times of sz depletion when the szas become more complex e g multiple disconnected dnapl areas and elongated pools of different dimensions to handle the non stationarity of dnapl szas arshadi et al 2020 and koch and nowak 2016 accounted for the pertinent multiphase physics to generate possible sza realizations providing physically realistic constraints for the dnapl imaging problem their methods were designed for the interpolation problem i e conditioning on direct borehole data like local dnapl saturations and permeabilities and are not directly applicable to imaging using indirect data at field sites where direct data are limited estimation relies on indirect data e g hydraulic head and geophysical data that are also more inexpensive to collect kang et al 2020 in an estimation method using indirect data kang et al 2021 trained a convolutional variational autoencoder cvae kingma and welling 2014 using dnapl sza realizations generated from multiphase modeling to provide a physically based representation of the sn field the cvae network was then integrated with an ensemble smoother es to formulate a joint inversion framework cvae es for sza imaging combining the information from both the physically based prior and the indirect data the cvae es method accurately reconstructed the steady state sza kang et al 2021 in this study we extend the work of kang et al 2021 to real time monitoring of dnapl sza with time dependent state variables i e dnapl saturation sn and effective hydraulic conductivity keff we first employ the cvae to parameterize the sn and k fields during dnapl remediation capturing dnapl sz patterns as the sz is evolving and its spatial characteristics are changing we then combine the cvae network with the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 a geostatistical data assimilation method the enkf is used to estimate sn and keff fields temporal evolution by inverting oscillatory hydraulic tomography oht downgradient aqueous phase dnapl concentration and electrical resistivity tomography ert measurements the proposed data assimilation framework cvae enkf is applied to two different dnapl szas one pool dominated and one residual dominated undergoing remediation in a heterogeneous aquifer the dnapl szas are estimated sequentially at selected time intervals representing early mid and long term remediation phases thereby providing significantly different spatial patterns from connected dnapl szs to multiple disconnected dnapl areas we investigate both the estimation accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed cvae enkf method compared to the traditional enkf method finally we summarize the proposed method s applicability and benefits for long term monitoring of evolving dnapl szas 2 methodology in this section we describe the forward numerical models used to generate the dnapl sz realizations and the synthetic data for our study section 2 1 and the data assimilation framework used to invert the data and characterize the evolving dnapl sza section 2 2 2 1 forward modeling 2 1 1 dnapl infiltration and dissolution model for synthetic dnapl sz generation synthetic dnapl szas are generated by a fast stochastic invasion percolation sip algorithm adapted from ewing and berkowitz 1998 and described in koch and nowak 2015 the sip algorithm simulates dnapl infiltration by modeling invasion into each model cell according to its entry pressure as a result dnapl infiltration into cells and the final sza are controlled by effective permeabilities of each cell as well as a stochastic component that accounts for unresolved variability in pore scale properties the sip algorithm can generate elaborate and tortuous szas that are physically consistent with the underlying permeability field koch and nowak 2015 after dnapl infiltration the dnapl szs were assumed to be immobile and to change only due to dnapl dissolution in the post infiltration phase further infiltration was ignored and only dnapl dissolution due to advection and lateral dispersion was modeled detwiler et al 2009 starting with the dnapl szs produced by the sip algorithm t 0 the mass flux from the dnapl to the aqueous phase was simulated by the rate at which the solute at the interface boundary equal to the solubility concentration cs of the dnapl was removed by advective dispersive transport no reaction was considered to generate the evolving dnapl sz realizations however using sz realizations that include reaction e g chemical oxidation and bioremediation as in real dnapl contaminated sites can still be accommodated without any change to the proposed data assimilation algorithm the transport of dissolved dnapl was simulated with an adapted particle tracking random walk ptrw model koch and nowak 2014 koch and nowak 2015 given that the dnapl mass depletion can influence the groundwater flow through changes in relative permeabilities a few updates of the flow field and the ptrw simulations were required during the dnapl depletion modeling koch and nowak 2015 describe in detail the ptrw algorithm for fast dnapl depletion simulations in this study we applied the sip dnapl infiltration and ptrw dnapl depletion algorithms to generate the synthetic data for the temporal evolution of sn and corresponding effective hydraulic conductivity keff fields before and during the dnapl remediation phase we then divided these generated sn and keff fields into two parts the first part was used as training samples for the convolutional variational autoencoder cvae network and the second part was used as reference fields for the data assimilation experiments the reference fields were then used to produce the indirect hydrogeophysical data see section 2 1 2 for the data assimilation and compare with the estimated dnapl szs when evaluating the cvae enkf method 2 1 2 groundwater flow transport model and geoelectrical model for synthetic indirect data generation as discussed we assumed that the final sza generated by sip in the dnapl infiltration phase has reached equilibrium and no further infiltration takes place after t 0 the dnapl acting as an immobile contaminant source in the subsurface see kang et al 2021 therefore single phase models were used to simulate three types of hydrogeophysical datasets for each quasi static sn field that was imaged downgradient dissolved dnapl concentrations oht derived pressures and ert derived potentials e g aghasi et al 2013 kang et al 2021 yeh and zhu 2007 the presence of the dnapl was factored in the groundwater flow model through the effective aqueous hydraulic conductivity keff ki kr sn where ki and kr denote the intrinsic and relative hydraulic conductivity respectively therefore the hydraulic head data h from oht was governed by keff while the downgradient dnapl concentration data c was governed by both the keff and sn the electrical potential data v from ert was directly controlled by sn we assumed that the background soil matrix is nonclayey and we did not consider any correlation between hydraulic conductivity and electrical conductivity following archie s law a well established hydraulic electric petrophysical relationship used to link the sn with the electrical conductivity σ archie 1942 archie s law postulates that the soil matrix is non conductive nonclayey and that only electrolytic conduction of the fluids within the pore space contributes to σ the groundwater flow model the aqueous phase dnapl transport model and the geoelectrical forward model were all solved in comsol multiphysics multiphysics 1994 to obtain the oht downgradient dnapl concentration and ert measurements respectively during the dnapl remediation phase for details on the governing equations for these hydrogeophysical forward models please refer to the appendix 2 2 data assimilation framework cvae enkf in this study we used ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 as the data assimilation method to estimate the temporal evolution of sn and keff fields using indirect data to handle the non stationarity of the sn we modified the standard enkf method to cvae enkf which utilizes the cvae to parameterize the sn keff fields into a normally distributed low dimensional latent space kang et al 2021 the enkf is an algorithm to implement kalman filtering for large dimensional systems it uses an ensemble of realizations to represent efficiently the covariance matrix of the state of a dynamic system and assimilate available measurements data enkf can also be adapted to estimate static unknown model parameters schöniger et al 2012 in this study we estimated sn and keff as the unknown state variables at several data assimilation times each time using previously described hydrogeophysical measurements i e c h and v as data the iterative enkf is a variant of enkf for nonlinear estimation problems and was utilized here enkf is summarized in algorithm 1 chen and oliver 2012 algorithm 1 ensemble kalman filter as utilized in

0 represents the 0th iteration the vector of state variables at time t can be defined as 1 x t s n t l n k e f f t t where sn t and keff t represent the dnapl saturation and effective hydraulic conductivity fields at time t respectively for each time step t we applied iterative optimization to maximize the posterior probability of the updated state variables conditioning on the measurements and their differences between simulated data emerick reynolds 2013 ghorbanidehno et al 2020 gu and oliver 2007 the x i t in algorithm 1 represents the x vector at time t for the i th iteration based on the x i t we can obtain the corresponding simulated measurement vector d i t through the hydrogeophysical models g described in section 2 1 2 which includes the hydraulic head h from oht downgradient dnapl concentration c and electrical potential v from ert then we updated the state vector x i t through eq 2 step 7 of algorithm 1 2 x i 1 t x i t c xd i t c dd i t c d t 1 d obs t d i t where c xd i t is the cross covariance matrix between the state vector i e x i t and the simulated data i e d i t at time t for the i th iteration c dd i t is the covariance matrix of the simulated data both c xd i t and c dd i t are computed from the ensemble statistics c d t corresponds to the error covariance matrix of the measurements and d obs t is the vector of measured data at time t for each data assimilation step we iteratively updated the state vector x t using eq 2 until one of the following termination criteria was met i number of iterations 10 ii root mean square error rmse between the simulated data d t and measurements d obs t was less than the threshold predefined according to the measurement error and iii the improvement in data fit i e the rmse between the simulated data and measurements was less than 5 between two adjacent iteration steps emerick reynolds 2013 through iterations we can obtain the posterior ensemble x post t at time t subsequently we used the forward model f to propagate the x vector to the next time step i e from x t to x t 1 and utilized the obtained x t 1 vector as the prior ensemble for the next time step the random walk model was used as f to propagate the sn and keff in time since the did not significantly change in adjacent time steps see figure s2 and s3 in supporting information e g vauhkonen et al 1998 nenna et al 2011 li et al 2014 soueid ahmed et al 2019 the aforementioned procedure was repeated for each data assimilation step every 5 years of physical time see figures s2 and s3 until the last time step t 10 in algorithm 1 providing the estimate of the temporal evolution of sn and keff the data assimilation used in the iterative enkf described above is most accurate when the prior distribution of x is gaussian however the highly nonstationary sn fields violate such a gaussian assumption directly employing the standard enkf method to update the sn fields may fail to produce physically realistic estimates of dnapl szas e g li et al 2017 thus in this study we used the convolutional variational autoencoder cvae kingma and welling 2014 to map the non stationary state variables x sn ln keff t to normally distributed latent variables z that we update thus satisfying the gaussian assumption of enkf cvae will be presented in more detail below after the modified data assimilation framework is presented fig 1 illustrates the proposed cvae enkf framework first we trained the cvae network on a set of keff and sn realizations generated by the sip ptrw algorithm see section 2 1 1 this way the cvae network can capture the features of the highly irregular sz patterns as the sz is evolving over time once the cvae training process was finished fig 1 a the cvae s decoder was used within the data assimilation process described below to generate physically realistic sn and keff realizations from latent variables z after cvae training the sn and keff fields were estimated using the following procedure fig 1 b 1 start with an initial guess of the latent vector ensemble sampled from n 0 i 2 generate the corresponding sn and keff fields at time t through the trained cvae decoder taking the latent vector z t as input 3 run the hydrogeophysical forward model described in section 2 1 2 to obtain the simulated measurements i e ht ct and vt for each realization 4 update the latent vectors z t using the iterative enkf until the termination criterion is reached algorithm 1 where x is replaced by z 5 propagate z t forward to the next time step z t 1 using the random walk model 6 repeat 2 5 procedure until the last time step and 7 reconstruct estimated latent variables z to final estimates of x sn ln keff t the cvae neural network which was used as a parameterization method for keff and nonstationary sn fields falls into the category of generative models in machine learning see goodfellow et al 2016 as it can generate realizations with complex probability distributions in high dimensional spaces fig 1 a shows the cvae structure the cvae can parameterize the high dimensional fields into a low dimensional latent space retaining only the most important features of the spatial distributions of the unknowns more detail on the cvae parameterization method is provided by canchumuni et al 2019 and kang et al 2021 in cvae training we posed the sn reconstruction problem as a classification task to represent the highly nonstationary sn fields we binned the sn values into three categories i e sn 0 0 sn 0 2 and sn 0 2 corresponding to no dnapl subregions low saturation subregions ganglia and high saturation subregions pools respectively the threshold sn 0 2 was selected based on previous literature values e g christ et al 2010 gerhard and kueper 2003 this binning strategy allowed the analysis to focus on the relative spatial distribution of ganglia and pooled dnapl rather than the detailed sn values and reduced the uncertainty of the unknowns following this strategy see figure s1 in supporting information we quantized the sn values into discrete categories and then converted them into three probability maps the input images in figure s1 for the cvae training process in summary the cvae network receives one k map and three sn probability maps the encoder maps these four maps to z and the decoder reconstructs the k map and sn probability maps taking z as input then based on the probability maps the most likely sn is chosen as the reconstructed sn 3 synthetic case study design 3 1 synthetic source zone architectures and network training two 2d numerical experiments in the x z plane with differing types of sza were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods for monitoring a dnapl sz during the remediation process see fig 2 a pool dominated sza and a residual dominated sza were considered in which the initial ganglia to pool gtp ratios were 0 61 and 2 17 respectively gtp ratios are the ratio of the volume of napl present at or below residual saturation divided by the volume present at saturations greater than residual saturation christ et al 2006 to generate these two different dnapl szas we used different parameters i e covariance kernels of ki dnapl release rates and location of spill points in experiment 2 compared to experiment 1 all parameters used in the experiments are summarized in table 1 we conducted numerical experiments for a 2d confined aquifer 40 m 20 m which was discretized into 80 40 3200 grid blocks with the length of each block being 0 5 m δx δz 0 5 m synthetic intrinsic hydraulic conductivity ki fields were generated by a spectral based gaussian generation method dietrich and newsam 1993 using the geostatistical parameters in table 1 based on the reference ki field we used the sip algorithm to model dnapl infiltration and obtain the initial dnapl sza i e pre remediation phase t 0 year during the remediation phase t 0 year an imposed hydraulic gradient of 0 01 was applied which was higher than the ambient gradient to promote enhanced dissolution of the dnapl sz the total simulation time for dnapl remediation under this hydraulic gradient was 50 years and there are 11 equally spaced time points i e t 0 5 10 50 years the sip ptrw model was used to generate the spatial distributions of sn and keff at the chosen time steps the resulting reference sn and keff fields are shown in fig 2 and the complete temporal evolution of sn and keff are detailed in figures s2 and s3 the cvae was used to parameterize the sn and keff fields the architecture of the cvae network is shown in fig 1 a and detailed in table s1 the training data for the cvae were keff images and the corresponding sn probability images the training samples consisted of 30 000 sets of sn and keff sequences generated by the sip ptrw model each sequence comprised of 11 pairs of sn and keff images corresponding to the 11 time steps t 0 5 10 50 years to evaluate the cvae network s performance we generated another 3 000 testing sets that were not included in the training sets obtaining these 33 000 sets took 18 h using 20 cpus in parallel note that at most field sites the location of dnapl release points x 0 release rates v 0 and total release mass m 0 would be unknown thus we treated them as random variables when generating training samples i e x0 10 30 m x 0 ranges from x 0 10 m to x 0 30 m see the possible dnapl release area in fig 3 a ν0 3 10 6 7 10 6 m3 s m0 3 7 tons the ranges of v 0 and m 0 were referred to in previous studies on dnapl contaminant modeling koch and nowak 2015 koch and nowak 2016 maji et al 2006 we trained two different cvae networks for experiments 1 and 2 respectively we trained these networks on certain simulated geological formations gaussian or exponential covariance that can be inferred from the field borehole log data it is theoretically possible to train a single network to capture the szas in any geological formation by including more sza realizations generated from different geological formations as training data here we separately trained two networks for two experiments the training for each experiment took 11 7 h the latent space dimension was chosen as 400 which was referred to in previous study on steady state sn field reconstruction kang et al 2021 the reconstruction performance of the cvae was measured using the normalized root mean square error nrmse which can be defined as 3 nrmse 1 x max x min 1 n te j 1 n te x j x j 2 2 where nte is the number of the testing samples and and x are the actual and reconstructed vector of ln keff or sn respectively x max and x min are the maximum and minimum value of keff sn for in the testing set respectively 3 2 measurement data collection for the synthetic cases to monitor the remediation process of the dnapl szs four fully penetrating boreholes were set in the hypothetical aquifer fig 3 a each borehole had 20 pressure sampling ports except the downgradient borehole that also included 20 additional concentration sampling ports x 40 m z 1 2 20 m see the blue rectangle in fig 3 a to record the electrical potential anomalies caused by the presence of dnapl 80 ert electrodes were set in the boreholes and 41 electrodes were installed at the top aquifer aquitard contact fig 3 b for the groundwater flow model no flux boundary conditions bcs were imposed at the top and bottom of the aquifer while constant hydraulic head bcs were assigned to the two sides resulting in a mean hydraulic gradient of 0 01 this hydraulic gradient represented engineered groundwater pumping across the sza for the geoelectrical model insulation bcs were imposed at the top and bottom of the domain while zero potential bcs were fixed on the sides prior to the start of remediation at t 0 year 20 downgradient dissolved dnapl concentrations 3792 oht derived pressures and 944 ert derived potentials were collected to characterize the sza and keff because the cost of applying oht at a field site is relatively high we assumed the oht data was only available at t 0 year conversely less costly downgradient concentration sampling and ert were applied before and during the remediation phase i e t 0 5 10 50 years a gaussian error with zero mean and the standard deviation of 0 001 g l 1 v and 0 01 m was added to the synthetic measurements i e c v and h the noise for v corresponded to 2 5 of the maximum electrical potential change as done in previous studies e g camporese et al 2015 pollock and cirpka 2010 to illustrate the advantage of the cvae parameterization in estimating the unknown dynamic of the sza we compared the standard enkf method without cvae parameterization and the cvae enkf method the comparison was conducted for a pool dominated sza enkf pool and cvae enkf pool and a residual dominated sza enkf residual and cvae enkf residual see table 2 for the standard enkf method to constrain estimated sn values within the range 0 1 we used the transformed saturation s as the unknown state variable be estimated in enkf which was distributed over and was defined as follows james et al 2000 4 s ln s n 1 s n s n e s 1 e s equation 4 posed a soft constraint on sn values once updated by the enkf the s was then transformed back to original sn values for the hydrogeophysical forward model run since we applied a binning strategy for cvae enkf see figure s1 a similar binning approach was employed in the standard enkf for a fair comparison i e the estimated sn was discretized into three classes i e sn 0 0 2 0 4 by binning continuous sn values with upper level limits as 0 2 and 0 4 for the cvae enkf method the unknowns to be estimated were the normally distributed low dimensional latent variables z the estimated z was subsequently transformed back to sn by the decoder no other transformation was required different strategies were used to generate the initial keff and sn ensemble for the standard enkf and cvae enkf for the standard enkf we generated the initial ensemble using sip ptrw with random x 0 location of dnapl release points v 0 release rates and m 0 total release mass i e x0 10 30 m ν0 3 10 6 7 10 6 m3 s m0 3 7 tons for the cvae enkf the initial keff and sn ensemble was directly generated from the cvae s decoder given an ensemble of latent vectors z n 0 i as input for all four cases the number of the time steps nt and the ensemble size ne of the enkf method was nt 11 and ne 500 respectively the number of iterations for different cases was listed in table 3 and will be discussed later in section 4 3 all the case settings of experiments 1 and 2 were the same except for the reference sn and keff fields see fig 2 the simulations were run on a linux workstation equipped with 24 intel cores 2 5 ghz processors and 256 gb ram 4 results 4 1 experiment 1 application to pool dominated dnapl sza 4 1 1 accuracy of szas parameterized by the cvae the parameterization results for nonstationary sn and keff fields are shown in fig 4 it illustrates the cvae s reconstruction of a randomly chosen sn keff realization in the testing set more realizations are shown in figure s4 note that the cvae successfully reproduced the pattern of the sz and the corresponding keff fields during the remediation phase the reconstruction accuracy evaluated on the testing sets was nrmses 0 14 and nrmsek 0 076 in the sn and keff fields respectively in addition the sn and keff fields reconstructed from cvae can clearly reflect the sn keff interdependence i e high saturations correspond to low effective conductivities extending the previous study by kang et al 2021 the cvae network in this study can capture significantly different sz spatial patterns as the sz is evolving during the remediation process from connected dnapl szs to multiple disconnected dnapl areas the satisfactory performance was achieved at the one time cost of training the cvae using time lapse images this improved cvae network trained for monitoring dnapl szs has broader utility for real field applications with dnapl contaminated sites varying from fresh to aged szs and a wide range of aquifer and sz heterogeneity the cvae network is an effective parameterization approach for physically realistic sn and keff fields during remediation 4 1 2 estimation of dnapl szas and hydraulic conductivity fields figs 5 and 6 demonstrate the ensemble mean and standard deviation std of the estimated sn and keff fields from the enkf pool and cvae enkf pool cases figure s5 depicts two realizations from the posterior distributions from enkf and cvae enkf the posterior mean sn estimated from enkf can roughly locate the highly saturated dnapl regions sn 0 2 but cannot resolve the extent and shape of the reference sz at different time steps fig 5 in particular the enkf overestimated the dnapl area at later time steps e g t 30 50 years this poor performance can be explained by the posterior realizations shown in figure s4 the enkf generated some degenerate posterior sn realizations which were far from the reference sn field this is because of the significant deviation of the prior stationary assumption used in the standard enkf from physical reality i e nonstationary sn distribution for the keff estimated with the standard enkf fig 6 the posterior estimate gradually moved away from the reference keff field during the data assimilation process due to the low sensitivity of data i e ert and downgradient dnapl concentration to keff also the standard enkf failed to capture the sn keff interdependence see figs 5 and 6 due to the independently generated prior distributions for sn and keff in contrast the proposed cvae enkf framework better characterized the pre remediation sza t 0 year see fig 5 and better reproduced the evolution of the sn field during remediation t 0 year see fig 5 this is because i the cvae s decoder ensured that each realization honored the physics of dnapl infiltration and depletion remediation see figure s5 and ii the cvae parameterized the nonstationary sn field into the latent vector z n 0 i which satisfied the stationarity assumption of the enkf method thus avoiding degenerate realizations furthermore the cvae enkf successfully reproduced the temporal changes of the keff field during dnapl remediation and accurately captured the sn keff interdependence see figs 5 and 6 the advantages of the cvae enkf can also be observed in fig 7 which shows the nrmse for sn and keff fields for all timesteps for the two methods for field site applications the sn standard deviation std maps fig 5 can be used to quantify uncertainty and help design an optimal sampling strategy providing statistically favorable locations for additional monitoring boreholes e g sreekanth et al 2017 overall the uncertainty of sn produced by the enkf was higher than that from cvae enkf because the physically based prior provided by cvae is more informative than the stationary prior used in enkf besides the enkf derived std maps showed more spurious artifacts see the artifacts near the boundary of the domain figure s5 4 1 3 remedial performance evaluation in addition to delineating the morphology of the dnapl sz the following questions are also critical for remedial performance evaluation 1 how much dnapl mass has been remediated 2 where should remediation efforts be concentrated i e where are the remaining dnapl szs 3 how long will it take to clean up the remaining dnapl mass in the sz to further compare the performance of enkf and cvae enkf in these three aspects we compared six sn spatial metrics between the estimated and the reference szas during the remediation phase fig 8 1 the evolution of total dnapl mass remaining in the sz fig 8 a can serve as a quantifiable measurement for remedial effectiveness and efficiency itrc 2004 the reference rate of dnapl mass depletion decreased over time as expected since the most accessible dnapl subregions i e residual dnapl were gradually depleted the evolution of dnapl mass estimated from the enkf failed to reproduce the reference mass depletion at both early and later times in contrast the cvae enkf can satisfactorily estimate the reference evolution of dnapl mass although the remaining dnapl mass was still overestimated at later times i e up to 61 overestimation during t 30 to 50 years this overestimation would be reduced if instead of the random walk model to propagate sn to the next time step a numerical transport model was used to propagate the saturations in time i e function f in algorithm 1 however additional transport modeling comes at a higher computational cost the average value of the remaining dnapl mass error in cvae enkf estimation 0 46 tons was also remarkably lower by 51 than the corresponding error in enkf 0 93 tons 2 the location where dnapl mass remains and where remediation efforts should be concentrated can be reflected in the changes in and z center of the sz and the spread of dnapl mass fig 8 b 8c 8e and 8f fig 8 b and 8c indicate that the cvae enkf better reproduced the first spatial moments i e x and z center of mass than the standard enkf for the second spatial moments fig 8 e and 8f the enkf clearly overestimated the dnapl extent in the direction and underestimated the extent in the z direction which is also indicated in fig 5 t 30 and 50 years in contrast the cvae enkf more accurately reproduced the temporal evolution of the and z spread of mass 3 the mass of pooled dnapl mp and residual dnapl mr controls the dnapl dissolution behavior and can therefore serve as useful metrics to predict sz longevity and to analyze how long the remedial program will take to reach its goal abriola et al 2012 christ et al 2006 fig 8 d shows the mp estimated from the enkf and cvae enkf note that cvae enkf better reproduced the evolution of mp compared with enkf however cvae enkf underestimated the mp at early times i e t 0 15 years since the three categories sn 0 0 2 0 4 used in sn reconstruction failed to reproduce highly saturated area sn 0 4 using more categories can improve the reconstruction performance which would increase the computational effort in network training despite the successful performance of the cvae enkf in monitoring the dnapl remediation there was still a deviation of the cvae enkf obtained szas from the reference and two major sources of errors i e false positive and false negative errors existed false positive error corresponds to estimating positive sn in a region where no dnapl exists while false negative corresponds to a failure to estimate a positive dnapl in a region where dnapl exists the overestimated underestimated dnapl mass from false positives negatives for the enkf pool and cvae enkf pool cases are shown in table s2 from a remediation perspective false negatives may lead to missing an entire portion of the dnapl sz and not employing necessary remediation at some contaminated regions in contrast false positives may result in overdesigning remedial programs fig 9 demonstrates that the cvae enkf produced fewer false positives and false negatives than the standard enkf 4 2 experiment 2 application to residual dominated dnapl sza next the performance of the proposed framework cva enkf was evaluated for a residual dominated sza fig 3 the imaging of residual dnapl with the proposed hydrogeophysical data is more challenging because of the low sensitivity of the ert signals to low dnapl saturations e g power et al 2014 4 2 1 accuracy of szas parameterized by the cvae fig 10 illustrates the cvae s reconstruction of a randomly chosen sn keff realization in the testing set the cvae successfully reproduced the evolution of sn and keff during the dnapl remediation and can capture the sn keff interdependence even at these lower saturations the reconstruction accuracy evaluated on the testing sets was nrmses 0 11 and nrmsek 0 061 in the sn and keff fields respectively 4 2 2 estimation of dnapl szas and hydraulic conductivity fields fig 11 and figure s6 illustrate the posterior ensemble mean and standard deviation of the estimated sn and keff fields for the enkf residual and cvae enkf residual cases both methods roughly captured the temporal evolution of the reference sza fig 11 still they failed to capture the dnapl in deeper regions due to the lower sensitivity of ert at depth power et al 2014 to improve the monitoring resolution in deeper regions one can incorporate additional datasets in the proposed framework such as partitioning tracer tests yeh and zhu 2007 kang et al 2020 and ert with surface to horizontal borehole arrays power et al 2015 4 2 3 remedial performance evaluation to further compare the ability of these two data assimilation methods to evaluate remedial performance we calculated the nrmse of sn and six sn spatial metrics using the estimated szas at different times see figs 12 and 13 fig 12 shows that the cvae enkf performed slightly better than standard enkf on average i e in terms of the nrmses since the cvae enkf can incorporate information from both the physically based prior provided by cvae parameterization and the hydrogeophysical measurements fig 13 indicates the results from cvae enkf were better than results from enkf for total dnapl mass mass of dnapl pools and spatial moments in the x and z directions cvae enkf outperformed enkf regarding pool dominated sz although the differences were less pronounced for the residual dominated sz for source zones that combine pools and residual zones we expect the estimation performance is between the one for the two experiments presented here with cvae enkf outperforming enkf for the aforementioned reasons 4 3 computational efficiency and convergence the computational effort required by the data assimilation methods presented here can be significant for large domains and the nonlinear dependence between the unknowns in consecutive steps and between the unknowns and the data can lead to difficulties in convergence of the optimization problem of matching the measurements potentially leading to failure to reach an acceptable final estimate such difficulties are expected to be alleviated when using a more appropriate prior like the cvae based prior utilized in the proposed method increasing the robustness and reducing the computational cost of the data assimilation the computational time and number of iterations needed to reach convergence over the whole data assimilation process are summarized in table 3 as expected compared with the standard enkf the cvae enkf reached convergence in fewer iterations this is because the iteration process in cvae enkf was constrained by both the measurements and the physically based prior while the iteration process in enkf was mainly constrained by the measurements with a less informative prior as a result the cvae enkf and the enkf required four and seven iterations respectively to reach convergence at t 0 year figure s7 moreover the cvae enkf method estimated the sn field more accurately by using fewer iterations 5 conclusions in this study we modified a well established data assimilation framework enkf to improve the accuracy of dnapl estimation from multi source indirect hydrogeophysical data the proposed cvae enkf framework provides a physically based prior distribution for dnapl saturations improving both the estimation of the evolving dnapl sza and related remediation metrics during the remediation process therefore cvae enkf exhibits strong potential as a high resolution approach for monitoring dnapl remediation two numerical experiments in a 2d heterogenous aquifer with significantly different szas i e pool dominated and residual dominated demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data assimilation framework for monitoring the evolution of dnapl szs as the sz architecture is changing during remediation results show that compared with the traditional enkf without the cvae parameterization the proposed cvae enkf framework can i more accurately capture the evolving dnapl sza and the sz metrics e g spatial moments of the sz during remediation ii reduce the estimation error of remaining dnapl mass by 51 and iii reach convergence using less computational effort i e fewer iterations the proposed cvae enkf method outperforms enkf because it captures the physics of dnapl infiltration depletion by using data from multiphase modeling to train the cvae network resulting in higher accuracy and also because the cvae normally distributed low dimensional latent vectors used in place of the nonstationary high dimensional sn fields in enkf satisfy the stationary assumption of enkf resulting in a more robust estimation in our synthetic cases cvae enkf overestimated the remaining dnapl mass at the end of remediation not as much as enkf but by up to 61 which was related to the approximation error from the random walk model during data assimilation process and the failure to reproduce highly saturated dnapl area by using only three categories in sn reconstruction the method can be extended and further improved by using transport modeling to approximate the sn dynamics and by using more categories in sn reconstruction however higher computational cost would be required for data assimilation and network training the proposed cvae enkf framework is highly promising for improved monitoring of the changes of dnapl szs during site remediation which is critical for optimizing the remedial strategy and site operations since the method can utilize both the physically based prior distribution of dnapl saturations and field measurements it may achieve high resolution estimation of dnapl szas even with sparse indirect data furthermore existing enkf algorithms can be adapted to include the cvae informed prior without intrusive code modifications the prior generation could be further optimized to improve sza reconstruction by adopting recently developed deep generative models such as generative adversarial networks goodfellow et al 2014 zhong et al 2020 future work will further explore the effectiveness of the proposed data assimilation framework through controlled sandbox experiments and or pilot tests of dnapl

4319,after the impoundment of three gorges reservoir tgr its tributaries have been frequented by algal blooms especially the xiangxi river xxr stratified flow induced by temperature difference often occurs which likely influences the water exchange and algae transport process between the tributary and tgr to investigate the variation of flow field and algae concentration in xxr a 2 dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model is developed the simulation results show good agreement with field observed data reproducing the water exchange and algal bloom process notwithstanding the hydrodynamic environment of xxr is complicated the thermal stratified flows are generalized into six typical patterns in this paper subsequently algae transport processes under the influence of different thermal stratified flow patterns are examined thermal stratified flows from upstream and tgr intrude into the bay tributary through different layers with different combinations resulting in water exchange of xxr is the major cause of algae transport difference we show that when the mainstream intrusive flow and upstream inflow separately intrude into the xxr through the surface and bottom layer hydrodynamic environments are favorable to algae transport with the final chlorophyll a chl a concentrations of entire xxr lower than algal bloom threshold value the worst scenarios occur when the mainstream flow intrudes through middle or bottom layer while the upstream inflow enter through bottom layer with the final algal bloom coverage rate r alg of 82 3 and 78 1 respectively in terms of superimposed effect of different flow patterns when the sequentially thermal stratified flows have different effect on algae transport direction algae will concentrate in the reach rather than discharged which increase the risk of multiple algal blooms these findings represent an important step towards understanding the multiple outbreaks of algal bloom in xxr during the spring and provide a new perspective for the research of algal bloom governance keywords thermal stratified flow algae transport numerical simulation three gorges reservoir algal bloom 1 introduction algal bloom is of environment concern because it threatens the health of public and sustainability of ecosystems has an increasing frequency and severity the accumulation of water borne microorganisms during algal bloom period can produce a number of toxicity secondary metabolites falconer 1999 causing sickness in farm livestock and humans carmichael and boyer 2016 smith and daniels 2018 taking dominant cyanobacterial species as example they could release a type of hepatotoxin named microcystin long term consuming water containing microcystin higher than 0 1 μg l could induce a series of diseases including liver cancer lone et al 2015 in a survey of china s freshwater lakes and reservoirs 16 3 of the polluted water is attributed to eutrophication huang et al 2019 and another recent nationwide assessment reveals that 28 of the total 107 surveyed reservoirs and lakes are experiencing eutrophication problems ministry of ecology and environment 2020 therefore researches have been extensively carried out on eutrophication governance algal bloom events are typically caused by the variation of a multitude of ambient conditions such as nutrient concentration water temperature wind speed illumination and water column stability paerl et al 2016 2019 wood et al 2017 wurtsbaugh et al 2019 jones and poplawski 1997 among these hydrodynamic environment is commonly considered as one of the main influencing factors butcher 1932 liu et al 2012 firstly the hydrodynamic conditions are important factors for planktonic algae growth and there is an optimal flow velocity larger or smaller than it the growth of algae will be inhibited long et al 2011 whitford and schumacher 1961 secondly the water turbulent affects the quantity and species structure of plankton community by changing the nutrient concentration of water cózar and echevarría 2005 furthermore the variation of flow velocity shear force resistance and turbulence intensity caused by hydrodynamic environment change can also limit algae enrichment qi et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 as the highest profile hydraulic project the three gorges project has got a remarkable success in electricity generation flood control and shipping capacity improvement but it is always assailed by algal bloom problems yang et al 2013 after the 175 m impoundment 25 1 of the nutrition status of the main tributaries in the three gorges reservoir is in eutropher china three gorges corporation 2019 from 2008 to 2018 according to the monitoring of main tributaries in the reservoir area the algal bloom has an annual occurrence in xxr and in some reaches the algal bloom events happen many times in a year as a typical eutrophic tributary of tgr the frequently algal bloom events in the xxr draw a great deal of attention previous studies have preliminarily confirmed that the changes of nutrient concentrations illumination intensity and water temperature in the yangtze river and its tributaries before and after the impoundment are negligible whereas the significant variation of hydrodynamic condition is probably the main cause of algal blooms liu et al 2016 liu et al studied the environment factors in the xxr using field data and reported that the development of thermal stratification caused by the temperature difference between the water in mainstream of the tgr and tributary is the direct and primary contributor to the onset of spring algal bloom liu et al 2012 mao et al mao et al 2015 analyzed the role of hydrodynamics in the occurrence and development of algal blooms in the xxr using the data of 2005 some researchers also pointed out that water temperature stratification s blocking of the enriched nutrients transport of the upper reach of xxr is the primary cause of spring algal bloom lang et al 2019 xu et al proposed that the value of zmix zeu mixed layer depth euphotic layer depth can be as the symbol of starting algal bloom control and tried to adjust the value through the operation of tgr lian et al tried to adjust the reservoir operation rules of tgr to enhance water exchange between the mainstream of tgr and the xxr tributary and change the thermal structure of xxr lian et al 2014 ma and lian 2011 however most of early studies only figure out that water temperature stratification is the trigger of algal blooms in xxr and they mainly concentrate on the decreased water velocity in the tributary after the filling of tgr and enrichment of nutrients ye et al 2009 2006 even though the thermal stratification flows have been found in existing studies before this study disturbance of these special flow patterns on tributary waterbody as well as its influence on algal concentration variation has not been fully investigated previous studies have shown that the nutrition concentration primarily nitrogen and phosphorus of xxr in the spring of 2009 is high and far beyond the thresholds for eutrophication total phosphorus 0 02 mg l total nitrogen 0 2 mg l gao et al 2018 thus under certain water temperature and solar radiation conditions the algal bloom of different intensity significantly depends on hydrodynamic conditions the pattern of thermal stratified flow is a determinant of whether the hydrodynamic environment is suitable for algal dissipation or provide sufficient time for algae growth on this basis the study of water exchange caused by thermal stratified flow in xxr and its effect on algae transport process is of great practical significance to the aquatic environment governance of this region besides there is no study concerning hydrodynamic relationship among multiple algal blooms additionally operation tests and previous studies point to measures such as biochemistry method ecological treatment and feasible reservoir operation schemes that may have positive impacts on reducing the algal bloom level in the near dam tributaries sha et al 2015 but it does not specify what governance measures should be taken under certain hydrodynamic condition data released from the china three gorges corporation show the algal bloom problem in the spring of xxr is an urgent need to resolve to explore the relationship between thermal stratified flow variation and the three algal bloom events in the spring of 2009 this study mainly focusses on the spring season in this study a hydrodynamic and water quality numerical model is established using ce qual w2 and calibrated with the field observed data through this model the hydrodynamic and water quality variation process of xxr in 2009 spring is reproduced and six typical thermal stratified flow patterns are generalized based on this water exchange and algae transport process under these flow patterns are numerically analyzed further on we also explore the sequentially superimposed effect of different thermal stratified flow patterns on algae transport and some algal bloom governance proposals are given in the end for this estuary and elsewhere this study estimates the response of algae transport to the thermal stratified flows in xxr and provides theoretical support for algal bloom governance 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yangtze river is the longest in china and the third longest in the world with a length of 6300 km the tgr is located at the upper reach of yangtze and impounds a reservoir extending 667 km from yichang to chongqing fig 1 a among the largest in the world the normal reservoir level of tgr is 175 0 m covering a 1084 km2 water surface area and 39 3 billion m3 water storage capacity the reservoir s average annual runoff is 14 000 m3 s and inflow ranges from 3000 m3 s to 30 000 m3 s normally within a year while the yangtze is a subtropical river the average annual temperature of the tgr is 17 6 c gao et al 2018 the xxr is a tributary of the yangtze river located 34 5 km upstream of the three gorges dam this river originates from the shennongjia forestry district and flows from north to south through xingshan and zigui counties the xxr has a total distance of 94 km before flowing into the yangtze river and the watershed area is approximately 3099 km2 110 25 111 06 e 31 04 31 34 n the backwater of xxr extends up to 25 40 km from the estuary after the impoundment of tgr fig 1 shows the location of the three gorges dam and the xxr in this paper the study area includes a 598 5 km reach of tgr from the three gorges dam to chongqing fig 1a and a 32 km reach of the xxr from gaoyang town to the estuary fig 1b 2 2 model development 2 2 1 model setup ce qual w2 is a two dimensional longitudinal vertical laterally averaged hydrodynamic and water quality model developed by the u s army corps of engineers waterways experiment station which is suitable for numerical simulation of long and narrow rivers estuaries and reservoirs afshar et al 2011 norton and bradford 2009 this model has been successfully used in many hydrodynamic and water quality simulation covering the cases of ameirkabir lake santo anastácio behesht abad sanbanxi and zayandeh roud reservoir et al arefinia et al 2020 hasanzadeh et al 2020 he et al 2019 mesquita et al 2020 ziaie et al 2019 the tgr and xxr are set as different water bodies in the model so that each river can computes with independent conditions the number of segments in the mainstream of the tgr is 147 with 4 5 km for each while 130 segments in the xxr with 250 m for each fig 2 according to the terrain and water level 212 vertical layers are used with 1 m interval each segment of the reservoir model is also characterized by its horizontal orientation and bottom friction and the width ranges from 10 m to 1300 m the upstream boundary of xxr is defined by the daily average discharge and water temperature observed at the xingshan hydrometric station which is located approximately 36 km from the mainstream fig 1b china three gorges university carries out the field observation in xxr monthly and provides the constituent concentrations over the model calibration period field data on the elevation of the water surface fig 3 a and discharge of the tgr fig 3b are obtained from the china three gorges corporation http www ctg com cn besides daily meteorological data at the zigui station are obtained from the meteorological administration of hubei province 2 2 2 model calibration the model is calibrated using the field observed temperature and water quality data from october 1st 2008 to june 15th 2009 besides the kinetic parameters in the water quality model such as maximum growth rates for algae respiration rates for algae and half saturation constants for nutrient limited growth are initially specified from default values and literature values lian et al 2014 and they are eventually identified through model calibration the mean absolute error mae and root root mean square error rmse are used in this paper to examine the validity of the model li et al 2020a 2020b lian et al 2019 the calculated water surface elevation matches the observed data well shown in fig a 1 fig 4 shows the comparisons between the model calculated and field observed temperature distributions the vertical temperature distributions calculated by the model are generally conform with the observed at most of the conditions constituents including nitrate nitrogen no3 n ammonia nitrogen nh3 n phosphate po4 dissolved silica d si and chlorophyll a chl a playing essential roles in aquatic ecosystems are selected for water quality calibration three commonly used model evaluation statistics including root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr are adopted in general model simulation can be judged as satisfactory if nse 0 50 and rsr 0 70 moriasi et al 2007 results shown in table 1 indicate that the model performed well in simulating the water quality of the mainstream of the tgr and xxr in april and may the water temperature and illumination intensity are suitable for algal growth resulting the chl a concentration at a high level which indicates a high risk of algal bloom fig 5 in general for most of the conditions calculated results agree well with the observed which means the model established in this study can predict the temperature stratification and algal blooms of xxr well 2 3 phenomena analysis the xxr is disturbed by upstream inflow and mainstream intrusive flow caused by water temperature difference the temporal variation of velocity distribution at estuary of xxr is shown in fig 6 a where the negative value means the flow direction is from the downstream to upstream during the simulation the flow pattern of xxr varies frequently and the whole process can be summarized as follows october 1st 2008 december 31th 2008 during this period weather change is evident and the surface temperature of xxr changes dramatically with its influence the position of mainstream intrusive flow switches among surface middle and bottom layers frequently january 1th 2009 january 20th 2009 the water temperature of both the xxr and tgr decrease in the lower reach of xxr water temperature at the bottom of river is slightly higher than tgr and the mainstream intrusive position gradually descends from surface to bottom layer january 21th 2009 february 5th 2009 the mainstream intrudes through bottom layer fig 6a february 6th 2009 february 22th 2009 as the air temperature rises in spring the position of mainstream intrusive flow rises gradually and finally reaches the surface layer february 23th 2009 february 28th 2009 the mainstream intrudes through surface layer march 1th 2009 april 15th 2009 with the temperature of xxr rising mainstream intrusive position changes to middle layer fig 6b in addition with the increase of discharge rate water exchange is strengthened and the flow velocity is increased april 16th 2009 june 15th 2009 this process is accompanied by the decrease of water level thus the position of mainstream intrusive flow switches constantly between middle and surface layer fig 6c the flow distribution and velocity value are constantly changing and each flow pattern lasts no more than 15 days which confirms the complexity of thermal stratified flows on the one hand temperature difference between the tgr and xxr cause water from the mainstream intrudes into the tributary through the bottom middle or surface layers on the other hand the upstream inflow enters into the xxr through either bottom or surface layers because the upstream river is shallow in summary thermal stratified flows caused by temperature difference have many variations in the xxr which make the hydrodynamic environment of this region special 2 4 identification and classification of typical thermal stratified flow patterns the xxr is disturbed by the upstream inflow uf and the mainstream intrusive flow mf as previously mentioned section 2 3 1 there are two intrusive positions for upstream inflow s b and three for mainstream intrusive flow s m and b in xxr therefore six typical thermal stratified flow patterns are generalized on the basis of combinations as shown in fig 7 type s b the temperature of tgr is higher than xxr so the mainstream water intrudes into xxr through the surface layer instead the upstream inflow is cold and enters the xxr through bottom layer type s s the temperature of xxr is lower than tgr and upstream inflow the mainstream and upstream flow intrude into the xxr both through the surface layer type m b water temperature of tgr is between the surface and bottom temperature of xxr the mainstream water intrudes into the xxr through the middle layer meanwhile the upstream inflow enters through bottom layer type m s the mainstream water intrudes into the xxr through middle layer and the upstream inflow enters through the surface layer type b b the temperature of xxr is high mainstream intrusive flow and upstream inflow intrude into the tributary both through the bottom layer type b s the temperature of tgr is lower than xxr and mainstream water intrudes through the bottom layer on the contrary the upstream inflow enters the tributary through surface layer because of its high temperature numerical simulation scenarios are set on the basis of above six thermal stratified flows in the simulation inflow rate is set as 47 3 m3 s which is the annual average discharge of xxr li et al 2020a 2020b meanwhile the outflow rate is 9031 43 m3 s the annual average discharge of tgr in discharged period huang et al 2020 likewise the water level of xxr is set as 160 m which is the annual average value in the spring according to previous studies the critical value of chl a concentration for algal bloom in xxr is 32 59 62 81 μg l zheng et al 2006 in this paper the mean value 47 7 μg l is selected as the threshold furthermore the most adverse scenario where algal bloom covers the entire xxr reach is set as initial condition according to the field measured data algae exist within 10 m beneath the water surface of xxr thus in this simulation in order to highlight the impact of thermal stratified flows on algae transport the chl a concentration within 10 m beneath the water surface is set as threshold value 2 5 sequential superposition of stratified flow patterns in practice as the water temperature of tgr and xxr constantly changing thermal stratified flows switching among the aforementioned six patterns and influence of latter pattern on algae transport is possibly restricted or promoted by the former one the sequentially superimposed effect of two flow patterns on flow field and algae transport are discussed in a premise that the algal bloom area did not completely disappear under the action of the first thermal stratified flow two indicators algae transport direction and algae transport speed are used to evaluate the sequentially superimposed effect and the score criterion are shown in table 2 the significance of the evaluation results can be interpreted as following 2 the effect of two thermal stratified flows on the algae bloom area transport is reversed and algae transport speed slows down in this condition the hydrodynamic environment is the worst case for algae transport 1 the effect of two thermal stratified flows on the algae transport is reversed but has little effect on algae transport speed hydrodynamic environment in this condition is better than 2 0 there are two scenarios one is the effect of two thermal stratified flows on the algae transport is reversed but the later flow pattern is more conducive to algae transport than the former one and the other is the effect of two thermal stratified flows on the algae transport is consistent but the algae transport speed slows down 1 the second thermal stratified flow does not have much effect on the former one and the algae transport speed is constant 2 on this occasion the effect of algae transport by former flow is enhanced and the hydrodynamic environment is the most favorable for algae transport the continuous encounter of three or more stratified flow patterns can be regarded as the continuous superposition of two stratified flow the development trend of hydrodynamic conditions can be analyzed according to the evaluation results the analysis of sequentially superimposed effect has profound meaning of predicting the trend of algal bloom and providing a guidance for algal bloom governance on the basis of water quality and temperature monitoring 3 results 3 1 algae transport process in the 2009 spring according to continuously monitored data there are three successive algal bloom events in the spring of 2009 and the numerical simulation reproduces this process fig 8 the first one occurs in february with a cover area of 4 8 km from the upstream this algal bloom event is minor and lasts 15 days fig 8a the second one starts from april 1st and ends at april 11th the algal bloom cover area moves from the upper reach to the lower reach with the surface flow fig 8b the third algal bloom is the worst one and lasts more than 20 days its outbreak is induced by residual algae from the second algal bloom the residual algae at lower reach of xxr return to the upper reach with the push of upstreamward flow during this process the favorable external condition leads an explosion of algae growth and algal bloom covers the entire reach in a short time in this process the maximum chl a concentration is 147 μg l with an average of 80 μg l whereafter with the surface anticlockwise flow the algae are mixed into deep water ultimately some algae die from the lack of illumination in deep water and others are discharged into tgr with bottom flow fig 8c 3 2 simulation results under typical thermal stratified flow patterns 3 2 1 water exchange the longitudinal velocity distribution in xxr at the moment of earlier medium and later stage of simulation under six typical thermal stratified flows are shown in fig 9 the mainstream intrusive flow upstreamward and upstream inflow downstreamward are marked with mf and uf on the graph respectively type s b an anticlockwise circulation forms at the estuary of tributary and orients towards the upper reach instead the upstream inflow enters the tributary from bottom layer fig 9a the inflow and reverse compensation flow converge on the 3rd day 9 km away from the upstream boundary thus a stable stratified flow with anticlockwise circulation is formed however with the inflow of high temperature mainstream water the temperature of xxr increases gradually resulting the weakness of mainstream intrusive intensity type s s the mainstream intrusive flow and upstream inflow with opposite directions meet on the 2 5th day 13 km away from the upstream boundary of xxr fig 9b the upstream inflow flows to the bottom layer under the pressure of mainstream intrusive flow ultimately the flow pattern is the same as type s b type m b at first the mainstream intrusive flow intrudes into the xxr from the middle layer 13 49 m below the water surface causing an anticlockwise compensation flow at bottom layer and a clockwise one at the surface fig 9c the clockwise bottom circulation and downstreamward bottom layer inflow meet on the 5th day and then the bottom flow is enhanced with the discharge of surface high temperature water temperature difference between xxr and tgr is decreasing and the position of intrusive flow gradually rises from the 10th day the flow pattern is the same as type s b type m s the two surface downstreamward flow join on the 4th day fig 9d but due to the inflow of upstream high temperature water the surface temperature of xxr is still higher than tgr although the position of mainstream intrusive flow unchanged its intensity decreases type b b while the mainstream water intrudes into the xxr from bottom layer a clockwise circulation is formed at the estuary of tributary and expands to upper reach fig 9e the bottom layer upstream inflow uf is blocked and then flows along the upper edge of intrusive flow with the influx of cold mainstream water the temperature of xxr gradually decreases and the intrusion position rises type b s the upstream inflow enters xxr through the surface layer and join with the compensation flow of mainstream intrusive flow on the 3rd day 14 km from the upstream boundary fig 9f due to the inflow of upstream high temperature water temperature change of xxr more slowly than type b b therefore at the end of simulation mainstream water intrudes through the middle layer 3 2 2 algal bloom coverage rate the ratio of the reach where chl a concentration exceeds the threshold of algal bloom to the whole river is defined as the algal bloom coverage rate r alg fig 10 shows the temporal variation of r alg under six typical thermal stratified flows besides the final chl a concentration distribution of xxr is shown in fig 11 from the eutrophication governance point of view type s b has the optimal hydrodynamic environment for algae transport on the 6th day the algal bloom entirely disappears in type b s the r alg decreases slowly but eventually reaches 0 on the 15th day algae density of upper and middle reach is low while most of algae aggregate at the estuary the worst cases occur in type m b and b b with the final r alg of 82 3 and 78 1 respectively and the final algal bloom cover the reach 5 28 km away from the upstream boundary of xxr 3 2 3 algae transport algae transport simulation results under six typical thermal stratified flows are shown in fig 12 and these processes can be summarized as follows type s b pushed by strong surface anticlockwise intrusive flow some algae in lower reach plunge into deep water directly fig 12a others move towards upper reach and then are mixed into deep water at 5 km from the upstream algae in deep water form a belt that is parallel with the bottom slope die from the lack of illumination or discharge with flow into the tgr the whole process from the beginning to the entirely disappearance of algal bloom last 6 days type s s algae transport process in this scenario is the same as type s b but the surface upstream inflow and intrusive flow from both sides push the algae gather at the upper reach 5 km downstream further than type s b resulting in the chl a concentration of this area exceeding the threshold and final r alg is 8 3 fig 12b type m b algae on the surface of water are discharged into tgr with the flow of upstream inflow in earlier stage but with the variation of intrusive position the surface discharge channel is blocked fig 12c and from the third day to the 15th day the value of r alg is barely changed with a final value of 82 3 type m s algae are pushed to lower reach under the effect of surface upstream inflow and compensation flow of middle layer intrusive flow fig 12d with the decrease of inflow the algae transport process is slowed eventually residual algae gather at the estuary of tributary before being discharged with the final r alg of 2 1 the maximum of final chl a concentration in the whole reach is 52 2 μg l a little higher than the threshold type b b the earlier stage condition of this scenario is similar to type m b under the action of the surface downstreamward flow a small group of algae are discharged fig 12e but different from others the variation of r alg is fluctuating in this scenario on the 9th day the mainstream intrusive position rises to surface meanwhile algal bloom area is pushed to upper reach and the value of r alg has a slightly increase but with the weakness of intrusive flow algal bloom area moves towards downstream again the maximum of final chl a concentration is up to 190 μg l and final the final r alg is 78 1 type b s the upstream inflow pushes the surface algae transfer towards lower reach but the algae located at the bottom of cover area move towards upper reach under the influence of mainstream intrusive flow these two flows create a clockwise movement of the algae cover area throughout the xxr fig 12f the bottom algae are continuously mixed to the surface layer and then discharged into tgr with surface downstreamward flow on the 7th day r alg reduce to 16 3 and the algal bloom decay process slows down after that at end of this process most algae discharge into tgr through the surface layer with the final r alg is 0 through the above algae transport process analysis algae transport characteristics under the action of six typical thermal stratified flows are summarized as shown in table 3 3 2 4 superposition effects according to section 2 5 the sequentially superimposed effect of two different thermal stratified flows can be summarized as six grades and the evaluation results are shown in fig 13 for type s b and b s the hydrodynamic environment of first stratified flow is conducive to algae transport so it won t make a positive effect no matter what pattern of flow is to follow conversely the hydrodynamic environment of type m b and b b is the most unfavorable for algae transport thus when followed by other patterns as long as the two thermal stratified flows have the same effect on the algae transport the sequentially superimposed effects are all positive overall the sequentially superimposed effects are not optimistic under most conditions and algal bloom governors should pay special attention to the situation where the result is 2 4 discussion based on the above results the three algal bloom events of xxr in the spring of 2009 can be reviewed as shown in fig 3b water temperature of tgr is lower than xxr from january 1st to march 21th in 2009 subsequently the temperature of tgr gradually rises and finally higher than xxr for upstream inflow the xxr originates from shennongjia forestry district and the temperature of upstream inflow is generally cold the thermal stratified flow pattern changes from type b b to m b then to s b in type b b a small number of algae can be discharged from the reach when the flow pattern changes to m b the sequentially superimposed effect is 1 which means the hydrodynamic conditions have not been improved the algae transport speed is still low leaving a lot of time for algal growth soon after that the flow pattern changes to type s b and the corresponding sequentially superimposed effect is 0 indicating the hydrodynamic condition goes through the process of getting worse first and then getting better residual algae in the middle and lower reach of xxr are pushed towards upstream and algal concentration of upper reach increase rapidly which eventually lead to the third algal bloom ultimately under the continuous action of type s b thermal stratified flow algae either discharge into the tgr with bottom flow or die from the lack of illumination the superimposed effect of different thermal stratified flows indicates the connection between sequentially algal blooms the action of previous stratified flow on algae effects the aggregation location and degree of remaining algae in the reach thus effecting the next algae transport process when the direction of sequentially thermal stratified flows on algae transport is different transport channel is blocked and algae concentrate in the reach which causes a hidden danger for algal blooms this can be used to predicate algal bloom events in general the current algae concentration of xxr reach can be measured and the thermal stratified flow variation trend can be calculated according to the meteorological forecast data on this basis we can foresee the followed stratified flow pattern as well as its sequentially superimposed effect on algae transport according to the evaluation method mentioned in section 2 5 response countermeasures and programs can be proposed according to the predicted results there are many other tributaries simultaneously influenced by thermal stratified flows caused by mainstream backwater and upstream inflow li et al 2020a 2020b zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2016 so the results obtained from the simulation of xxr can be used for algal bloom governance in waterbodies with the same hydrodynamic environment as the xxr when the waterbody is disturbed simultaneously by thermal stratified flows from upstream and downstream a large clockwise or anticlockwise circulation is formed fig 9a and f in this condition the hydrodynamic environment is favorable for algae transport and should be maintained or promoted by reservoir operations in this process algae will be discharged with the surface downstreamward dominant flow fig 12a or mixed into deep water and then die from the lack of illumination fig 12f if the hydrodynamic environment is adverse to algae transport the dominant flow formed in the middle or bottom layer of water body with an extremely weak surface flow leading to the obstruction of surface layer algae discharge channel fig 12c and e measures should be taken to minimize the algal aggregation area for example rising water level or increasing the discharge rate as much as possible through reservoir operations lian et al 2014 subsequently partial algae control measures such as ecological treatments can be adopted for improving water quality 5 conclusion in this study a 2d longitudinal vertical tgr xxr numerical model is established to investigate the water exchange and algae transport process caused by thermal stratified flow in xxr the model results have successfully reproduced the special hydrodynamic and water quality characteristics including thermal stratification and algal bloom events of xxr the model results show good agreement with field observations the main findings of this research are as follows 1 there are notable thermal stratified flows that occur in the xxr due to the water temperature difference between the xxr and mainstream of the tgr and the flow patterns have a seasonal variation in terms of the water temperature difference between upstream inflow mainstream intrusive flow and xxr the thermal stratified flows can be generalized into six patterns 2 the thermal stratified flows of type s b and b s are conducive to algae transport in these two patterns algae can be discharged into tgr entirely the worst case scenarios are type m b and b b they occur when the temperature getting warmer and the heating rate of xxr is faster than tgr or the discharge of tgr increased causing a large number of surface high temperature water released the two conditions are common in spring season which is one of the main reasons for frequent occurrence of algal blooms measures such as increasing the frequency of water quality and temperature monitoring and adjusting the reservoir operation should be taken in time for algal bloom governance 3 the sequentially superimposed effect of different thermal stratified flows on algae transport gives a good explanation of the multiple algal blooms in spring this method can be used to predict algal blooms which provide a theoretical foundation for ameliorating algal bloom problem through adjusting reservoir operation in this study the effects of thermal stratified flow on the hydrodynamic and algae transport process are investigated the results are also suitable for other reservoirs and tributaries with hydrodynamic environment similar to xxr which provide an explanation for algal blooms in spring and further studies can be taken in this basis focusing on algal bloom governance the research results are of guidance significance for conducting feasible reservoir operation rules of reservoirs moreover the model and the method adopted in this study could provide a new perspective on solving the algal bloom problems in similar reservoirs and

4319,after the impoundment of three gorges reservoir tgr its tributaries have been frequented by algal blooms especially the xiangxi river xxr stratified flow induced by temperature difference often occurs which likely influences the water exchange and algae transport process between the tributary and tgr to investigate the variation of flow field and algae concentration in xxr a 2 dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model is developed the simulation results show good agreement with field observed data reproducing the water exchange and algal bloom process notwithstanding the hydrodynamic environment of xxr is complicated the thermal stratified flows are generalized into six typical patterns in this paper subsequently algae transport processes under the influence of different thermal stratified flow patterns are examined thermal stratified flows from upstream and tgr intrude into the bay tributary through different layers with different combinations resulting in water exchange of xxr is the major cause of algae transport difference we show that when the mainstream intrusive flow and upstream inflow separately intrude into the xxr through the surface and bottom layer hydrodynamic environments are favorable to algae transport with the final chlorophyll a chl a concentrations of entire xxr lower than algal bloom threshold value the worst scenarios occur when the mainstream flow intrudes through middle or bottom layer while the upstream inflow enter through bottom layer with the final algal bloom coverage rate r alg of 82 3 and 78 1 respectively in terms of superimposed effect of different flow patterns when the sequentially thermal stratified flows have different effect on algae transport direction algae will concentrate in the reach rather than discharged which increase the risk of multiple algal blooms these findings represent an important step towards understanding the multiple outbreaks of algal bloom in xxr during the spring and provide a new perspective for the research of algal bloom governance keywords thermal stratified flow algae transport numerical simulation three gorges reservoir algal bloom 1 introduction algal bloom is of environment concern because it threatens the health of public and sustainability of ecosystems has an increasing frequency and severity the accumulation of water borne microorganisms during algal bloom period can produce a number of toxicity secondary metabolites falconer 1999 causing sickness in farm livestock and humans carmichael and boyer 2016 smith and daniels 2018 taking dominant cyanobacterial species as example they could release a type of hepatotoxin named microcystin long term consuming water containing microcystin higher than 0 1 μg l could induce a series of diseases including liver cancer lone et al 2015 in a survey of china s freshwater lakes and reservoirs 16 3 of the polluted water is attributed to eutrophication huang et al 2019 and another recent nationwide assessment reveals that 28 of the total 107 surveyed reservoirs and lakes are experiencing eutrophication problems ministry of ecology and environment 2020 therefore researches have been extensively carried out on eutrophication governance algal bloom events are typically caused by the variation of a multitude of ambient conditions such as nutrient concentration water temperature wind speed illumination and water column stability paerl et al 2016 2019 wood et al 2017 wurtsbaugh et al 2019 jones and poplawski 1997 among these hydrodynamic environment is commonly considered as one of the main influencing factors butcher 1932 liu et al 2012 firstly the hydrodynamic conditions are important factors for planktonic algae growth and there is an optimal flow velocity larger or smaller than it the growth of algae will be inhibited long et al 2011 whitford and schumacher 1961 secondly the water turbulent affects the quantity and species structure of plankton community by changing the nutrient concentration of water cózar and echevarría 2005 furthermore the variation of flow velocity shear force resistance and turbulence intensity caused by hydrodynamic environment change can also limit algae enrichment qi et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 as the highest profile hydraulic project the three gorges project has got a remarkable success in electricity generation flood control and shipping capacity improvement but it is always assailed by algal bloom problems yang et al 2013 after the 175 m impoundment 25 1 of the nutrition status of the main tributaries in the three gorges reservoir is in eutropher china three gorges corporation 2019 from 2008 to 2018 according to the monitoring of main tributaries in the reservoir area the algal bloom has an annual occurrence in xxr and in some reaches the algal bloom events happen many times in a year as a typical eutrophic tributary of tgr the frequently algal bloom events in the xxr draw a great deal of attention previous studies have preliminarily confirmed that the changes of nutrient concentrations illumination intensity and water temperature in the yangtze river and its tributaries before and after the impoundment are negligible whereas the significant variation of hydrodynamic condition is probably the main cause of algal blooms liu et al 2016 liu et al studied the environment factors in the xxr using field data and reported that the development of thermal stratification caused by the temperature difference between the water in mainstream of the tgr and tributary is the direct and primary contributor to the onset of spring algal bloom liu et al 2012 mao et al mao et al 2015 analyzed the role of hydrodynamics in the occurrence and development of algal blooms in the xxr using the data of 2005 some researchers also pointed out that water temperature stratification s blocking of the enriched nutrients transport of the upper reach of xxr is the primary cause of spring algal bloom lang et al 2019 xu et al proposed that the value of zmix zeu mixed layer depth euphotic layer depth can be as the symbol of starting algal bloom control and tried to adjust the value through the operation of tgr lian et al tried to adjust the reservoir operation rules of tgr to enhance water exchange between the mainstream of tgr and the xxr tributary and change the thermal structure of xxr lian et al 2014 ma and lian 2011 however most of early studies only figure out that water temperature stratification is the trigger of algal blooms in xxr and they mainly concentrate on the decreased water velocity in the tributary after the filling of tgr and enrichment of nutrients ye et al 2009 2006 even though the thermal stratification flows have been found in existing studies before this study disturbance of these special flow patterns on tributary waterbody as well as its influence on algal concentration variation has not been fully investigated previous studies have shown that the nutrition concentration primarily nitrogen and phosphorus of xxr in the spring of 2009 is high and far beyond the thresholds for eutrophication total phosphorus 0 02 mg l total nitrogen 0 2 mg l gao et al 2018 thus under certain water temperature and solar radiation conditions the algal bloom of different intensity significantly depends on hydrodynamic conditions the pattern of thermal stratified flow is a determinant of whether the hydrodynamic environment is suitable for algal dissipation or provide sufficient time for algae growth on this basis the study of water exchange caused by thermal stratified flow in xxr and its effect on algae transport process is of great practical significance to the aquatic environment governance of this region besides there is no study concerning hydrodynamic relationship among multiple algal blooms additionally operation tests and previous studies point to measures such as biochemistry method ecological treatment and feasible reservoir operation schemes that may have positive impacts on reducing the algal bloom level in the near dam tributaries sha et al 2015 but it does not specify what governance measures should be taken under certain hydrodynamic condition data released from the china three gorges corporation show the algal bloom problem in the spring of xxr is an urgent need to resolve to explore the relationship between thermal stratified flow variation and the three algal bloom events in the spring of 2009 this study mainly focusses on the spring season in this study a hydrodynamic and water quality numerical model is established using ce qual w2 and calibrated with the field observed data through this model the hydrodynamic and water quality variation process of xxr in 2009 spring is reproduced and six typical thermal stratified flow patterns are generalized based on this water exchange and algae transport process under these flow patterns are numerically analyzed further on we also explore the sequentially superimposed effect of different thermal stratified flow patterns on algae transport and some algal bloom governance proposals are given in the end for this estuary and elsewhere this study estimates the response of algae transport to the thermal stratified flows in xxr and provides theoretical support for algal bloom governance 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yangtze river is the longest in china and the third longest in the world with a length of 6300 km the tgr is located at the upper reach of yangtze and impounds a reservoir extending 667 km from yichang to chongqing fig 1 a among the largest in the world the normal reservoir level of tgr is 175 0 m covering a 1084 km2 water surface area and 39 3 billion m3 water storage capacity the reservoir s average annual runoff is 14 000 m3 s and inflow ranges from 3000 m3 s to 30 000 m3 s normally within a year while the yangtze is a subtropical river the average annual temperature of the tgr is 17 6 c gao et al 2018 the xxr is a tributary of the yangtze river located 34 5 km upstream of the three gorges dam this river originates from the shennongjia forestry district and flows from north to south through xingshan and zigui counties the xxr has a total distance of 94 km before flowing into the yangtze river and the watershed area is approximately 3099 km2 110 25 111 06 e 31 04 31 34 n the backwater of xxr extends up to 25 40 km from the estuary after the impoundment of tgr fig 1 shows the location of the three gorges dam and the xxr in this paper the study area includes a 598 5 km reach of tgr from the three gorges dam to chongqing fig 1a and a 32 km reach of the xxr from gaoyang town to the estuary fig 1b 2 2 model development 2 2 1 model setup ce qual w2 is a two dimensional longitudinal vertical laterally averaged hydrodynamic and water quality model developed by the u s army corps of engineers waterways experiment station which is suitable for numerical simulation of long and narrow rivers estuaries and reservoirs afshar et al 2011 norton and bradford 2009 this model has been successfully used in many hydrodynamic and water quality simulation covering the cases of ameirkabir lake santo anastácio behesht abad sanbanxi and zayandeh roud reservoir et al arefinia et al 2020 hasanzadeh et al 2020 he et al 2019 mesquita et al 2020 ziaie et al 2019 the tgr and xxr are set as different water bodies in the model so that each river can computes with independent conditions the number of segments in the mainstream of the tgr is 147 with 4 5 km for each while 130 segments in the xxr with 250 m for each fig 2 according to the terrain and water level 212 vertical layers are used with 1 m interval each segment of the reservoir model is also characterized by its horizontal orientation and bottom friction and the width ranges from 10 m to 1300 m the upstream boundary of xxr is defined by the daily average discharge and water temperature observed at the xingshan hydrometric station which is located approximately 36 km from the mainstream fig 1b china three gorges university carries out the field observation in xxr monthly and provides the constituent concentrations over the model calibration period field data on the elevation of the water surface fig 3 a and discharge of the tgr fig 3b are obtained from the china three gorges corporation http www ctg com cn besides daily meteorological data at the zigui station are obtained from the meteorological administration of hubei province 2 2 2 model calibration the model is calibrated using the field observed temperature and water quality data from october 1st 2008 to june 15th 2009 besides the kinetic parameters in the water quality model such as maximum growth rates for algae respiration rates for algae and half saturation constants for nutrient limited growth are initially specified from default values and literature values lian et al 2014 and they are eventually identified through model calibration the mean absolute error mae and root root mean square error rmse are used in this paper to examine the validity of the model li et al 2020a 2020b lian et al 2019 the calculated water surface elevation matches the observed data well shown in fig a 1 fig 4 shows the comparisons between the model calculated and field observed temperature distributions the vertical temperature distributions calculated by the model are generally conform with the observed at most of the conditions constituents including nitrate nitrogen no3 n ammonia nitrogen nh3 n phosphate po4 dissolved silica d si and chlorophyll a chl a playing essential roles in aquatic ecosystems are selected for water quality calibration three commonly used model evaluation statistics including root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr are adopted in general model simulation can be judged as satisfactory if nse 0 50 and rsr 0 70 moriasi et al 2007 results shown in table 1 indicate that the model performed well in simulating the water quality of the mainstream of the tgr and xxr in april and may the water temperature and illumination intensity are suitable for algal growth resulting the chl a concentration at a high level which indicates a high risk of algal bloom fig 5 in general for most of the conditions calculated results agree well with the observed which means the model established in this study can predict the temperature stratification and algal blooms of xxr well 2 3 phenomena analysis the xxr is disturbed by upstream inflow and mainstream intrusive flow caused by water temperature difference the temporal variation of velocity distribution at estuary of xxr is shown in fig 6 a where the negative value means the flow direction is from the downstream to upstream during the simulation the flow pattern of xxr varies frequently and the whole process can be summarized as follows october 1st 2008 december 31th 2008 during this period weather change is evident and the surface temperature of xxr changes dramatically with its influence the position of mainstream intrusive flow switches among surface middle and bottom layers frequently january 1th 2009 january 20th 2009 the water temperature of both the xxr and tgr decrease in the lower reach of xxr water temperature at the bottom of river is slightly higher than tgr and the mainstream intrusive position gradually descends from surface to bottom layer january 21th 2009 february 5th 2009 the mainstream intrudes through bottom layer fig 6a february 6th 2009 february 22th 2009 as the air temperature rises in spring the position of mainstream intrusive flow rises gradually and finally reaches the surface layer february 23th 2009 february 28th 2009 the mainstream intrudes through surface layer march 1th 2009 april 15th 2009 with the temperature of xxr rising mainstream intrusive position changes to middle layer fig 6b in addition with the increase of discharge rate water exchange is strengthened and the flow velocity is increased april 16th 2009 june 15th 2009 this process is accompanied by the decrease of water level thus the position of mainstream intrusive flow switches constantly between middle and surface layer fig 6c the flow distribution and velocity value are constantly changing and each flow pattern lasts no more than 15 days which confirms the complexity of thermal stratified flows on the one hand temperature difference between the tgr and xxr cause water from the mainstream intrudes into the tributary through the bottom middle or surface layers on the other hand the upstream inflow enters into the xxr through either bottom or surface layers because the upstream river is shallow in summary thermal stratified flows caused by temperature difference have many variations in the xxr which make the hydrodynamic environment of this region special 2 4 identification and classification of typical thermal stratified flow patterns the xxr is disturbed by the upstream inflow uf and the mainstream intrusive flow mf as previously mentioned section 2 3 1 there are two intrusive positions for upstream inflow s b and three for mainstream intrusive flow s m and b in xxr therefore six typical thermal stratified flow patterns are generalized on the basis of combinations as shown in fig 7 type s b the temperature of tgr is higher than xxr so the mainstream water intrudes into xxr through the surface layer instead the upstream inflow is cold and enters the xxr through bottom layer type s s the temperature of xxr is lower than tgr and upstream inflow the mainstream and upstream flow intrude into the xxr both through the surface layer type m b water temperature of tgr is between the surface and bottom temperature of xxr the mainstream water intrudes into the xxr through the middle layer meanwhile the upstream inflow enters through bottom layer type m s the mainstream water intrudes into the xxr through middle layer and the upstream inflow enters through the surface layer type b b the temperature of xxr is high mainstream intrusive flow and upstream inflow intrude into the tributary both through the bottom layer type b s the temperature of tgr is lower than xxr and mainstream water intrudes through the bottom layer on the contrary the upstream inflow enters the tributary through surface layer because of its high temperature numerical simulation scenarios are set on the basis of above six thermal stratified flows in the simulation inflow rate is set as 47 3 m3 s which is the annual average discharge of xxr li et al 2020a 2020b meanwhile the outflow rate is 9031 43 m3 s the annual average discharge of tgr in discharged period huang et al 2020 likewise the water level of xxr is set as 160 m which is the annual average value in the spring according to previous studies the critical value of chl a concentration for algal bloom in xxr is 32 59 62 81 μg l zheng et al 2006 in this paper the mean value 47 7 μg l is selected as the threshold furthermore the most adverse scenario where algal bloom covers the entire xxr reach is set as initial condition according to the field measured data algae exist within 10 m beneath the water surface of xxr thus in this simulation in order to highlight the impact of thermal stratified flows on algae transport the chl a concentration within 10 m beneath the water surface is set as threshold value 2 5 sequential superposition of stratified flow patterns in practice as the water temperature of tgr and xxr constantly changing thermal stratified flows switching among the aforementioned six patterns and influence of latter pattern on algae transport is possibly restricted or promoted by the former one the sequentially superimposed effect of two flow patterns on flow field and algae transport are discussed in a premise that the algal bloom area did not completely disappear under the action of the first thermal stratified flow two indicators algae transport direction and algae transport speed are used to evaluate the sequentially superimposed effect and the score criterion are shown in table 2 the significance of the evaluation results can be interpreted as following 2 the effect of two thermal stratified flows on the algae bloom area transport is reversed and algae transport speed slows down in this condition the hydrodynamic environment is the worst case for algae transport 1 the effect of two thermal stratified flows on the algae transport is reversed but has little effect on algae transport speed hydrodynamic environment in this condition is better than 2 0 there are two scenarios one is the effect of two thermal stratified flows on the algae transport is reversed but the later flow pattern is more conducive to algae transport than the former one and the other is the effect of two thermal stratified flows on the algae transport is consistent but the algae transport speed slows down 1 the second thermal stratified flow does not have much effect on the former one and the algae transport speed is constant 2 on this occasion the effect of algae transport by former flow is enhanced and the hydrodynamic environment is the most favorable for algae transport the continuous encounter of three or more stratified flow patterns can be regarded as the continuous superposition of two stratified flow the development trend of hydrodynamic conditions can be analyzed according to the evaluation results the analysis of sequentially superimposed effect has profound meaning of predicting the trend of algal bloom and providing a guidance for algal bloom governance on the basis of water quality and temperature monitoring 3 results 3 1 algae transport process in the 2009 spring according to continuously monitored data there are three successive algal bloom events in the spring of 2009 and the numerical simulation reproduces this process fig 8 the first one occurs in february with a cover area of 4 8 km from the upstream this algal bloom event is minor and lasts 15 days fig 8a the second one starts from april 1st and ends at april 11th the algal bloom cover area moves from the upper reach to the lower reach with the surface flow fig 8b the third algal bloom is the worst one and lasts more than 20 days its outbreak is induced by residual algae from the second algal bloom the residual algae at lower reach of xxr return to the upper reach with the push of upstreamward flow during this process the favorable external condition leads an explosion of algae growth and algal bloom covers the entire reach in a short time in this process the maximum chl a concentration is 147 μg l with an average of 80 μg l whereafter with the surface anticlockwise flow the algae are mixed into deep water ultimately some algae die from the lack of illumination in deep water and others are discharged into tgr with bottom flow fig 8c 3 2 simulation results under typical thermal stratified flow patterns 3 2 1 water exchange the longitudinal velocity distribution in xxr at the moment of earlier medium and later stage of simulation under six typical thermal stratified flows are shown in fig 9 the mainstream intrusive flow upstreamward and upstream inflow downstreamward are marked with mf and uf on the graph respectively type s b an anticlockwise circulation forms at the estuary of tributary and orients towards the upper reach instead the upstream inflow enters the tributary from bottom layer fig 9a the inflow and reverse compensation flow converge on the 3rd day 9 km away from the upstream boundary thus a stable stratified flow with anticlockwise circulation is formed however with the inflow of high temperature mainstream water the temperature of xxr increases gradually resulting the weakness of mainstream intrusive intensity type s s the mainstream intrusive flow and upstream inflow with opposite directions meet on the 2 5th day 13 km away from the upstream boundary of xxr fig 9b the upstream inflow flows to the bottom layer under the pressure of mainstream intrusive flow ultimately the flow pattern is the same as type s b type m b at first the mainstream intrusive flow intrudes into the xxr from the middle layer 13 49 m below the water surface causing an anticlockwise compensation flow at bottom layer and a clockwise one at the surface fig 9c the clockwise bottom circulation and downstreamward bottom layer inflow meet on the 5th day and then the bottom flow is enhanced with the discharge of surface high temperature water temperature difference between xxr and tgr is decreasing and the position of intrusive flow gradually rises from the 10th day the flow pattern is the same as type s b type m s the two surface downstreamward flow join on the 4th day fig 9d but due to the inflow of upstream high temperature water the surface temperature of xxr is still higher than tgr although the position of mainstream intrusive flow unchanged its intensity decreases type b b while the mainstream water intrudes into the xxr from bottom layer a clockwise circulation is formed at the estuary of tributary and expands to upper reach fig 9e the bottom layer upstream inflow uf is blocked and then flows along the upper edge of intrusive flow with the influx of cold mainstream water the temperature of xxr gradually decreases and the intrusion position rises type b s the upstream inflow enters xxr through the surface layer and join with the compensation flow of mainstream intrusive flow on the 3rd day 14 km from the upstream boundary fig 9f due to the inflow of upstream high temperature water temperature change of xxr more slowly than type b b therefore at the end of simulation mainstream water intrudes through the middle layer 3 2 2 algal bloom coverage rate the ratio of the reach where chl a concentration exceeds the threshold of algal bloom to the whole river is defined as the algal bloom coverage rate r alg fig 10 shows the temporal variation of r alg under six typical thermal stratified flows besides the final chl a concentration distribution of xxr is shown in fig 11 from the eutrophication governance point of view type s b has the optimal hydrodynamic environment for algae transport on the 6th day the algal bloom entirely disappears in type b s the r alg decreases slowly but eventually reaches 0 on the 15th day algae density of upper and middle reach is low while most of algae aggregate at the estuary the worst cases occur in type m b and b b with the final r alg of 82 3 and 78 1 respectively and the final algal bloom cover the reach 5 28 km away from the upstream boundary of xxr 3 2 3 algae transport algae transport simulation results under six typical thermal stratified flows are shown in fig 12 and these processes can be summarized as follows type s b pushed by strong surface anticlockwise intrusive flow some algae in lower reach plunge into deep water directly fig 12a others move towards upper reach and then are mixed into deep water at 5 km from the upstream algae in deep water form a belt that is parallel with the bottom slope die from the lack of illumination or discharge with flow into the tgr the whole process from the beginning to the entirely disappearance of algal bloom last 6 days type s s algae transport process in this scenario is the same as type s b but the surface upstream inflow and intrusive flow from both sides push the algae gather at the upper reach 5 km downstream further than type s b resulting in the chl a concentration of this area exceeding the threshold and final r alg is 8 3 fig 12b type m b algae on the surface of water are discharged into tgr with the flow of upstream inflow in earlier stage but with the variation of intrusive position the surface discharge channel is blocked fig 12c and from the third day to the 15th day the value of r alg is barely changed with a final value of 82 3 type m s algae are pushed to lower reach under the effect of surface upstream inflow and compensation flow of middle layer intrusive flow fig 12d with the decrease of inflow the algae transport process is slowed eventually residual algae gather at the estuary of tributary before being discharged with the final r alg of 2 1 the maximum of final chl a concentration in the whole reach is 52 2 μg l a little higher than the threshold type b b the earlier stage condition of this scenario is similar to type m b under the action of the surface downstreamward flow a small group of algae are discharged fig 12e but different from others the variation of r alg is fluctuating in this scenario on the 9th day the mainstream intrusive position rises to surface meanwhile algal bloom area is pushed to upper reach and the value of r alg has a slightly increase but with the weakness of intrusive flow algal bloom area moves towards downstream again the maximum of final chl a concentration is up to 190 μg l and final the final r alg is 78 1 type b s the upstream inflow pushes the surface algae transfer towards lower reach but the algae located at the bottom of cover area move towards upper reach under the influence of mainstream intrusive flow these two flows create a clockwise movement of the algae cover area throughout the xxr fig 12f the bottom algae are continuously mixed to the surface layer and then discharged into tgr with surface downstreamward flow on the 7th day r alg reduce to 16 3 and the algal bloom decay process slows down after that at end of this process most algae discharge into tgr through the surface layer with the final r alg is 0 through the above algae transport process analysis algae transport characteristics under the action of six typical thermal stratified flows are summarized as shown in table 3 3 2 4 superposition effects according to section 2 5 the sequentially superimposed effect of two different thermal stratified flows can be summarized as six grades and the evaluation results are shown in fig 13 for type s b and b s the hydrodynamic environment of first stratified flow is conducive to algae transport so it won t make a positive effect no matter what pattern of flow is to follow conversely the hydrodynamic environment of type m b and b b is the most unfavorable for algae transport thus when followed by other patterns as long as the two thermal stratified flows have the same effect on the algae transport the sequentially superimposed effects are all positive overall the sequentially superimposed effects are not optimistic under most conditions and algal bloom governors should pay special attention to the situation where the result is 2 4 discussion based on the above results the three algal bloom events of xxr in the spring of 2009 can be reviewed as shown in fig 3b water temperature of tgr is lower than xxr from january 1st to march 21th in 2009 subsequently the temperature of tgr gradually rises and finally higher than xxr for upstream inflow the xxr originates from shennongjia forestry district and the temperature of upstream inflow is generally cold the thermal stratified flow pattern changes from type b b to m b then to s b in type b b a small number of algae can be discharged from the reach when the flow pattern changes to m b the sequentially superimposed effect is 1 which means the hydrodynamic conditions have not been improved the algae transport speed is still low leaving a lot of time for algal growth soon after that the flow pattern changes to type s b and the corresponding sequentially superimposed effect is 0 indicating the hydrodynamic condition goes through the process of getting worse first and then getting better residual algae in the middle and lower reach of xxr are pushed towards upstream and algal concentration of upper reach increase rapidly which eventually lead to the third algal bloom ultimately under the continuous action of type s b thermal stratified flow algae either discharge into the tgr with bottom flow or die from the lack of illumination the superimposed effect of different thermal stratified flows indicates the connection between sequentially algal blooms the action of previous stratified flow on algae effects the aggregation location and degree of remaining algae in the reach thus effecting the next algae transport process when the direction of sequentially thermal stratified flows on algae transport is different transport channel is blocked and algae concentrate in the reach which causes a hidden danger for algal blooms this can be used to predicate algal bloom events in general the current algae concentration of xxr reach can be measured and the thermal stratified flow variation trend can be calculated according to the meteorological forecast data on this basis we can foresee the followed stratified flow pattern as well as its sequentially superimposed effect on algae transport according to the evaluation method mentioned in section 2 5 response countermeasures and programs can be proposed according to the predicted results there are many other tributaries simultaneously influenced by thermal stratified flows caused by mainstream backwater and upstream inflow li et al 2020a 2020b zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2016 so the results obtained from the simulation of xxr can be used for algal bloom governance in waterbodies with the same hydrodynamic environment as the xxr when the waterbody is disturbed simultaneously by thermal stratified flows from upstream and downstream a large clockwise or anticlockwise circulation is formed fig 9a and f in this condition the hydrodynamic environment is favorable for algae transport and should be maintained or promoted by reservoir operations in this process algae will be discharged with the surface downstreamward dominant flow fig 12a or mixed into deep water and then die from the lack of illumination fig 12f if the hydrodynamic environment is adverse to algae transport the dominant flow formed in the middle or bottom layer of water body with an extremely weak surface flow leading to the obstruction of surface layer algae discharge channel fig 12c and e measures should be taken to minimize the algal aggregation area for example rising water level or increasing the discharge rate as much as possible through reservoir operations lian et al 2014 subsequently partial algae control measures such as ecological treatments can be adopted for improving water quality 5 conclusion in this study a 2d longitudinal vertical tgr xxr numerical model is established to investigate the water exchange and algae transport process caused by thermal stratified flow in xxr the model results have successfully reproduced the special hydrodynamic and water quality characteristics including thermal stratification and algal bloom events of xxr the model results show good agreement with field observations the main findings of this research are as follows 1 there are notable thermal stratified flows that occur in the xxr due to the water temperature difference between the xxr and mainstream of the tgr and the flow patterns have a seasonal variation in terms of the water temperature difference between upstream inflow mainstream intrusive flow and xxr the thermal stratified flows can be generalized into six patterns 2 the thermal stratified flows of type s b and b s are conducive to algae transport in these two patterns algae can be discharged into tgr entirely the worst case scenarios are type m b and b b they occur when the temperature getting warmer and the heating rate of xxr is faster than tgr or the discharge of tgr increased causing a large number of surface high temperature water released the two conditions are common in spring season which is one of the main reasons for frequent occurrence of algal blooms measures such as increasing the frequency of water quality and temperature monitoring and adjusting the reservoir operation should be taken in time for algal bloom governance 3 the sequentially superimposed effect of different thermal stratified flows on algae transport gives a good explanation of the multiple algal blooms in spring this method can be used to predict algal blooms which provide a theoretical foundation for ameliorating algal bloom problem through adjusting reservoir operation in this study the effects of thermal stratified flow on the hydrodynamic and algae transport process are investigated the results are also suitable for other reservoirs and tributaries with hydrodynamic environment similar to xxr which provide an explanation for algal blooms in spring and further studies can be taken in this basis focusing on algal bloom governance the research results are of guidance significance for conducting feasible reservoir operation rules of reservoirs moreover the model and the method adopted in this study could provide a new perspective on solving the algal bloom problems in similar reservoirs and
