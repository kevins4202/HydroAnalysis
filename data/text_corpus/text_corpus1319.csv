6595,one of the main problems of signal processing is the issue of estimation which consists in reproducing a useful signal on the basis of another one e g one burdened with unwanted interference the use of classical filtering to eliminate disturbances carries the risk of removing an important part of the information about the useful signal in order to avoid this phenomenon optimal filters are used utilizing the statistical properties of signals such a case of consideration concerns the issue of estimation for stochastic systems an example is the kalman filter in which the main aspect of research is the differential equation of the state estimate in which there is an amplification factor dependent on the covariance matrix of the estimation error the value of this factor is determined from the non linear riccati differential equation depending on the characteristics of signals affecting the object under investigation and the measurement the paper proposes an adaptive algorithm to determine the value of the filter amplification factor which allows to avoid the inconveniences resulting from the need to estimate the characteristics of signals affecting the object under investigation the presented approach to estimation issues does not require the need to characterize random signals due to the application of the adaptive method of state estimation the analyzed process refers to an object described by ordinary differential equations with continuous measurements representing the state of pollution of the river using the so called interpretation along the characteristics the method used in the module of the intelligent analytical system allows for quick determination of hard to measure parameters of the quality of water in the river and to react to upcoming ecological threats without any delays dangerous for the system keywords mathematical modeling kalman filter river parameter monitoring dedicated diagnostic system optimization algorithms 1 introduction in the previous decade scientific research was dominated by a variety of issues often related to optimization and operational research most often strictly formalized in a deterministic approach with the addition of probabilistic elements they were so called hard tasks in which the conditions of the problem including the purpose of actions models and limitations were precisely defined and determined a typical approach in this situation was to find the best solution or to develop options to support further decision making the methodology of solving this type of problems consisted rather in finding and using appropriate mathematical apparatus and applied identification of the form of the model together with its deterministic parameters meanwhile both the contemporary increase in the requirements formulated for research and the development of available methods and even the emergence of innovative concepts have resulted in the so called soft tasks the essence of which are probabilistic methods approximate sets uncertain variables fuzzy logic neural networks and adaptive algorithms they provide a highly diversified formal apparatus especially as the above mentioned methods can be combined kondratenko and kondratenko 2018 kozlov et al 2019 kwater et al 2014 trunov 2018 analyzing the related topics encountered in literature a review of research related to solving and implementation of the issues presented in this paper was carried out the methodology of solving systemic tasks has clearly changed its character from analytical mathematical methods to procedures related to the use of the latest computer techniques and numerical methods cimorelli et al 2019 dippner 2009 dudek dyduch 2018 khaki et al 2018 koczkodaj et al 2019 velasquez villada and donoso 2016 it should be stressed however that the essence of the matter here is not the development of traditional numerical methods supporting classical mathematical problems but above all the development of specialized algorithms i e computer techniques thanks to which the processes of automation of measurements and globalization of information systems are more effective gomolka et al 2017 kloeden and lorenz 2017 sufyan et al 2019 changes in the paradigm of scientific research especially in modeling phenomena of global significance are justified by the rapid development of new computer techniques using information available in networks and the methods of selection and choice of data romero et al 2001 paszkiewicz and bolanowski 2017 the issues considered in khaki et al 2018 indicate that in recent years molecular filters have been used with great success in the problems of state estimation the method proposed to determine the approximation error is called kullback leiblera distance kld fox 2003 its key element is a specific approximation error determined on the basis of a particle filter however the statistical approach to increasing the efficiency of particle filters by adjusting the size of sample sets in the error determination process is burdened with additional requirements in the form of higher computing power requirements a similar subject matter is presented in kasprzak 2000 in this work adaptive calculations and appropriate techniques are used to analyze sequences of digital images however the problem concerned the adaptation of dynamic sequences and appropriately designed algorithms where the solution is based on ann learning gomolka et al 2018 kwater and bartman 2017 kwater et al 2014 kwater and krutys 2010 such types of biologically justifiable methods can be used as a computational equivalent and mechanism of visual perception the implementation of this type of algorithm is included in the category of adaptive object recognition however the implementation of such an approach requires a learning process which involves the pre processing of learners data there are many approaches related to the use of adaptive mechanisms in the process of estimation of the state of an object presented in atamanyuk et al 2019 roohollah et al 2013 sufyan et al 2019 worrall et al 2014 inter alia in this paper the authors proposed a new algorithm which was verified on the basis of simulation tests and the implementation of which was based on the idea of mathematical modeling with the use of numerical methods and a digital computer the designed algorithm is focused on objects with a serial structure which include various types of heat exchangers pusher furnaces chemical reactors working in a serial system or polluted rivers in particular a model of a biochemically polluted river was adopted for consideration in the paper the issues of mathematical modeling of the polluted river phenomena have been discussed in many studies casulli and walters 2000 chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 plawiak and tadeusiewicz 2014 yu et al 2019 due to the complexity of the phenomena described models have different structure and degree of complexity the paper chen et al 2015 finotti et al 2012 presents numerical modeling of transient flows in the open trough network this applies in particular to well known and used in engineering practice one dimensional numerical models based on the system of saint venant equations two dimensional equations of shallow water are also increasingly used pakrashi 2019 the development of numerical methods and computational power of modern computers has made the algorithms of solving flow transformation equations widely available and there is no longer a barrier to the time of execution of calculations and the amount of data necessary to obtain a correct solution therefore when attempting to model a river section it is first of all necessary to make a decision on the choice of transformation equations and algorithms of their solution an important factor is the ability to obtain software that implements algorithms for solving flow transformation equations due to the criterion of recreating the state of the system and object parameters in the spatial variability model models are divided into two groups lumped parameter models distributed parameter models the first group of models uses single numerical values expressing the cumulative parameters of the object distributed parameter models on the other hand are characterized by spatial variability of parameters and reflect the same variability of the modeled object a similar approach is presented in casulli and walters 2000 where the model is built on the basis of finite differences in the implicit method on the basis of three dimensional shallow water equations and modified to use non structural grids this solution has many advantages but there are problems with complicated geometry the models obtained are relatively simple based on a mass balance practical numerical methods for solving two dimensional water equations have been formulated using a finite difference in spatial discretization in this paper a mathematical model of a biochemically polluted river described by differential equations of hyperbolic type with division into sections was designed for such a model a transformation was carried out consisting in the conversion of partial differential equations into a set of ordinary differential equations on the so called flow velocity characteristics such a transformation does not affect the accuracy of the description of phenomena one of the main problems of signal processing is the issue of estimation which consists in reproducing or determining the useful signal on the basis of another highly interfered signal the use of classical filtration to eliminate interference can cause the loss of a significant part of the signal causing its quality change in order to avoid this optimal filters can be used using statistical properties of signals such filters include the kalman filter that recursively determines the minimum variance estimate of the state vector of the linear model of a dynamic system based on measurements of the output of this system it is assumed that both the measurement and the operation of processing inside the system is burdened with an error of gaussian distribution such a case of consideration concerns the issue of estimation for stochastic systems the main aspect of research in the kalman filter is the differential equation of the state estimate in which there is an amplification factor dependent on the covariance matrix of estimation error in general the kalman filter generates satisfactory state estimation results provided that the characteristics of the excitation signals are correctly defined in some cases of signals it is difficult to determine their random characteristics e g when determining the influence of atmospheric phenomena as excitation on the condition of water reservoirs other approaches to estimation issues do not require the need to characterize random signals successful adaptation methods can be indicated here gomolka et al 2018 using the adaptive algorithm proposed in the paper to determine changes in the filter amplification factor it is possible to perform state estimation with unmeasured coordinates for a selected class of objects with efficiency comparable to or better than in the case of classical methods implementation time and computational complexity will be more advantageous than kalman s standard filter solution on the basis of the proposed approach real state estimation systems can be implemented this is extremely important for the control of such objects in particular where measurements of some of the state vector coordinates require laboratory service currently available technical means and methods allow the adaptation task to be carried out in a short period of time and with unknown interference characteristics 2 methods 2 1 estimation criterion using the gauss markov model in this chapter issues which describe the constructed mathematical model used in the simulation part of the paper will be presented the density of the distribution of conditional probability p x y x y where the value of y is determined and x is variable includes full information about x resulting from the fact that y y in many cases it is more convenient losing part of the information to be satisfied with some simpler characteristic than the function e g assuming a single estimate evaluation of value of x at y y arfken et al 2013 chiles and delfiner 2012 rue and held 2005 it is useful to use an estimate with the minimum variance for which there is an inequality for all functions z of variable y 1 e x x 2 y y e x z 2 y y where x means an estimate of the value taken by x knowing that y y the basic property of an estimate with the minimum variance is contained in theorem 1 theorem 1 let x and y 1 be random vectors of known cumulative distribution and let y be measured by taking the value y let x be the estimate of x with the minimum variance then x is unambiguously determined as conditional average value x for y y i e 2 x e x y y xp x y x y dx this theorem leads to yet another definition of the discussed estimate which is the conditional mean estimate giudice del and grillo 2019 khaki et al 2018 worrall et al 2014 the procedure described so far involving the use of a known numerical vector y to determine by means of the density of conditional probability distribution the numerical vector x called the estimate of x is the definition of a certain function which we denote as x the field of this function is a set of values y of a random variable y as a function of a random variable it is also a random variable the value x assumes is x i e 3 x y x e x y y it shows that 4 x e x y because the name estimate is used for specific value x of the random variable x that this variable assumes as a result of the random variable y assuming the value y x is called the estimator of x conditioned by the variable y fig 1 shows the difference between the estimate and the estimator the quantity x is an unbiased estimate when the expected conditional value of the error resulting from taking x as an estimate of x at a given y is equal to zero 5 e x y x x y y e x y x y y x 0 and 6 e x y x x y 0 in the linear estimator class the kalman filter gives the smallest unconditional covariance matrix of error therefore the mean squared error of estimation is minimal in general the kalman filter is a recursive algorithm for determining the state vector estimate of a dynamic system model using the measurements of this system giudice del and grillo 2019 khaki et al 2018 siwek and osowski 2016 sufyan et al 2019 ucinski and patan 2010 wu and chau 2010 the algorithm is based on minimizing the square of the estimation error moreover it presumes that the model under consideration is affected by stochastic disturbances i e it is assumed that both the measurement and the process of processing inside the model system is burdened with an error of gaussian distribution gomolka et al 2018 kwater et al 2014 kwater and krutys 2010 the result of this algorithm is a state estimate taking into account the estimation criterion which results in an optimal solution in practice it may happen that a measurement does not include all the coordinates of the state vector this means that only measurements of not all elements of the state vector are used to reconstruct the full state vector this effect is particularly useful in control systems where missing system information is obtained from disturbed and indirect measurements christensen 2011 gillespie 1977 considering the above let us consider a system with measurements described in the following form 7 x t ax t bu t lw t t t 0 8 y t cx t v t where a state matrix b control matrix l system disturbance actions matrix c measurement matrix in the eqs 7 and 8 signals y w and v are the measurements and white gaussian noises of zero mean value and with covariance matrices expressed as follows 9 e w t w τ q δ t τ q q t 0 10 e v t v τ r δ t τ r r t 0 the processes v and w are mutually independent therefore e w t v τ 0 t τ t 0 for the system defined by the eqs 7 10 we look for the estimate x of state x minimizing the estimation error 1 the solution to this problem is given in the form of a kalman filter equation which is a differential equation in the form of kwater and krutys 2010 lee et al 2012 and trunov 2018 11 x t a x t k f t y t c x t x t 0 0 where k f kalman filter s amplification factor y measurements the estimation error x is a stochastic process with zero mean value its covariance matrix meets the following matrix riccati differential equation 12 dp dt ap t p t a t p t c t r 1 cp t lql t t t 0 with the initial condition 13 p t 0 p 0 if you know the solution of the eq 12 you can determine the filter amplification factor k f which is determined by the relation 14 k f t p t c t r 1 therefore in order to determine k f it is necessary to know the matrix p ultimately in order to determine the state estimate it is necessary to solve two equations i e the filter equation and the riccati equation in the further part of the work the kalman filter will be used for the issue of estimation of the biochemical state of river pollution 2 2 characteristics of stochastic processes the function x a 1 a 2 a m is called a random function which for all values of arguments a 1 a 2 a m is a random variable in the theory of automatic control we usually encounter accidental functions of one argument which is time t we will call the random function x t of time t a stochastic process the stochastic process of x t is therefore a random time t function which is a random variable for each selected moment in time the fullest characteristic of the stochastic process is the n dimensional density function f x x 1 x 2 x n t 1 t 2 t n for n a one dimensional density function f x x t of a stochastic process x t describes the distribution of this process and is an exhaustive characteristic of this process whose values for different moments in time are independent random variables a stochastic process x t is called a normal gaussian process if a n dimensional vector of components x t 1 x t 2 x t n for any given moment in time t 1 t 2 t n and for any n is a random vector of normal distribution it follows from this relationship that the function of random vector density with a normal distribution is fully determined only by the first two moments of its components the first two moments of a random vector are in turn fully determined by the two dimensional density function the two dimensional density function is therefore an exhaustive characteristic of the normal stochastic process a stochastic process x t is called a markov process if for moments in time t 1 t 2 t n and for any i n the conditional density function f x x i t i x i 1 t i 1 of a random variable x t i depends only on the random variable x i 1 x t i 1 and not on the random variables x t 1 x t 2 x t i 2 the two dimensional density function defined in this way is an exhaustive characteristic of a markov process the moment initial ordinary m x t 1 t k of the k th order of a stochastic process x t is the expected value of the product of random variables x t 1 x t 2 x t k 15 m x t 1 t 2 t k e x t 1 x t 1 x t 1 x 1 x 2 x k f x x 1 x 2 x 3 t 1 t 2 t k dx 1 dx 2 where f x x 1 x 2 x 3 t 1 t 2 t k is the k dimensional function of a stochastic process x t the moment of the first order of a stochastic process x t is called the expected value of this process 16 m x t e x t xf x x t dx the expected value of a stochastic process is a predetermined value non random depending on time t a stochastic process which is the deviation of the stochastic process from its expected value is called the centered stochastic process 17 x 0 t x t m x t the central moment of the k order of the stochastic process is the expected value of the product of concentrated random variables 18 μ x t 1 t 2 t k e x 0 t 1 x 0 t 2 x 0 t k x 1 m x t 1 x 2 m x t 2 x k m x t k f x x 1 x 2 x 3 t 1 t 2 t k dx 1 dx 2 dx k where f x x 1 x 2 x 3 t 1 t 2 t k is the k dimensional function of the stochastic process x t from the eq 18 it stems that the central moment of the first order of a stochastic process which is the expected value of the centered stochastic process is zero 19 μ x t e x 0 t 0 the central moment of the second order of a stochastic process x t is called the correlation function autocorrelation function of this process 20 x 1 m x t 1 x 2 m x t 2 f x x 1 x 2 t 1 t 2 dx 1 dx 2 in a specific case for t 1 t 2 t from the correlation function you obtain a variance of the stochastic process 21 d x 2 t e x o t 2 k x t t k x t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 t the mixed central moment of the k th order of a stochastic process is the expected value of the product 22 x 1 0 t 1 k 1 x 2 0 t 2 k 2 x n 0 t n k n that is 23 μ k 1 k 2 k n e x 1 0 t 1 k 1 x 2 0 t 2 k 2

the mutual correlation function of these processes 24 k x 1 x 2 e x 1 0 t 1 k 1 x 2 0 t 2 k 2 x 1 m x 1 t 1 k 1 x 2 m x 2 t 2 k 2 f x x 1 x 2 t 1 t 2 dx 1 dx 2 the standardized correlation function of a stochastic process x t is called the determined function defined with the formula 25 ρ x t 1 t 2 k x t 1 t 2 d x 2 t 1 d x 2 t 2 the mutual standardized correlation function of stochastic processes x 1 t x 2 t is called the determined function defined with the formula 26 ρ x 1 x 2 t 1 t 2 k x 1 x 2 t 1 t 2 d x 1 2 t 1 d x 2 2 t 2 stochastic processes x 1 t and x 2 t are called correlated if the mutual correlation function of these processes is different from zero and uncorrelated if it is equal to the identity zero it can be demonstrated in a manner analogous to that of random variables that independent stochastic processes are uncorrelated uncorrelated normal stochastic processes are independent consider the sum of stochastic processes x 1 t x 2 t x n t 27 y t i 1 n x i t the expected value of the sum of stochastic processes is equal to the sum of the expected values of these processes 28 m y t i 1 n m x i t with m y t e y t m xi t e x i t i 1 2 n consider the product of independent stochastic processes x 1 t x 2 t x n t 29 z t i 1 n x i t the expected value of the product of stochastic processes is equal to the product of the expected values of these processes 30 m z t i 1 n m x i t with m z t e z t m x i t e x i t i 1 2 n the correlation function of the stochastic process y t which is the sum of stochastic processes x 1 t x 2 t x n t is expressed by the formula 31 k y t 1 t 2 i j 1 n k x i x j t 1 t 2 with k x i x j t 1 t 2 e x i 0 t 1 x j 0 t 2 the correlation function of a stochastic process z t which is the product of independent stochastic processes x 1 t x 2 t x n t is expressed by the formula 32 k z t 1 t 2 i 1 n m x i t 1 t 2 i 1 n m x i t 1 m x i t 2 where m x t 1 t 2 e x i t 1 x i t 2 a stationary stochastic process x t can be called ergodic or meeting the ergodic hypothesis if it meets the dependency 33 lim t z t 1 t 2 1 t t 0 t 0 t x t dt m x 2 0 where t length of the averaging interval t 0 any moment of the initial averaging interval selected for the stochastic ergodic process the expected value in the set of achievements is therefore equal to the average value of one achievement for an infinitely long observation period t 34 m x lim t 1 t t 0 t 0 t x t dt a stationary process y t whose correlation function k y τ τ t 1 t 2 is limited for τ 0 35 k y 0 d y 2 m with m being a positive number and decreasing to zero for t approaching infinity 36 lim τ k y τ 0 is an ergodic process take into account a stationary stochastic process x t with the correlation function k x τ τ t 1 t 2 the spectral density s x ω of the stationary stochastic process x t is called the fourier transform of the correlation function k x τ of this process 37 s x 1 2 π k x τ e j ω τ d τ the correlation function k x τ corresponding to the given spectral density s x ω can be determined using the inverse fourier transform 38 k x τ 1 2 π s x e j ω τ d ω we say that a sequence of random variables x 1 x 2 x n is stochastically or in the sense of probability convergent to a random variable y if there is a relationship for any ε 0 39 lim n p x n y ε 0 in the theory of stochastic processes we most often encounter the so called mean square convergence we say that a sequence of random variables x 1 x 2 x n is meanly convergent with the square of a random variable y if 40 lim n e x n y 2 0 using chebyshev s inequality it can be shown that the convergence of the mean with the square results in a stochastic convergence of a sequence of random variables using the mean square convergence we can define the concepts of limit derivative and stochastic process integral let the stochastic process x t defined in the environment of point t 0 and some random variable y be given the random variable y is the limit of the stochastic process x t at point t 0 if for any ε 0 such δ 0 can be selected that 41 e x t y 2 ε for 0 t t 0 δ let the stochastic process x t in turn be defined at point t 0 and in its environment the stochastic process x t is continuous at point t 0 if for any ε 0 such δ 0 can be selected that 42 e x t x t 0 2 ε for t t 0 δ note that the continuity of a stochastic process is not equivalent to the continuity of its achievement we say that the random variable y is the derivative of the stochastic process x t at point t 0 if for any ε 0 such δ 0 can be selected that 43 e x t 0 δ t x t 0 δ t y 2 ε for δ t δ the derivative of the stochastic process can also be defined as follows the random variable y is derived from the stochastic process x t at point t 0 44 lim δ t 0 e x t 0 δ t x t 0 δ t y 2 0 the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the stochastic process derivative is the existence of a derivative of the expected value and a second derivative of the mixed correlation function of this process let the stochastic process x t defined in the range t 0 t be given let us take any division of the range t 0 t the random variable y is the integral of the stochastic process x t if for any ε 0 such δ 0 can be selected that 45 e k 1 n x τ k δ t k y 2 ε for δ t k δ the integral of the stochastic process can also be defined as follows the random variable y is the integral of the stochastic process x t if 46 lim max δ t k 0 e k 1 n x τ k δ t k y 2 0 the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the integral of a stochastic process is the existence of the integral of the expected value and the double integral of the correlation function of this process 2 3 estimating the state of an object with the kalman filter for the purpose of experimental research of this work an object representing water quality in water bodies and in particular in rivers was adopted the degree of water pollution can be determined by means of the so called quality indicators dobbins 1964 gomolka et al 2018 kwater et al 2014 kwater and krutys 2010 e g biochemical oxygen demand bod determining the amount of oxygen needed to oxidize organic compounds in water in biochemical processes under aerobic conditions the bod process can be described by the equation 47 dx 1 dt k 1 x 1 x 1 t 0 x 10 dissolved oxygen do as the temperature dependent concentration of dissolved oxygen in water describes the equation 48 dx 2 s dt k 2 x 1 k 3 x 2 n x 2 s a x 2 s t 0 x 20 where x 2 s mg l do concentration t day time k 2 rate coefficient of the bod influence on do k 3 rate coefficient of oxygen uptake from the atmosphere x 2 n mg l oxygen content in water at saturation a mg l day oxygen uptake intensity a detailed description of the bod and do indicators is described in gomolka et al 2018 kwater et al 2014 kwater and krutys 2010 and zhang et al 2018 the above indicators represent the concentration expressed in mg l the idea of a mathematical description of the quality of biochemically polluted water uses a model of a continuous stirred tank reactor in which there is a continuous flow it should be stressed that the oxygen consumption is assumed to be in accordance with the kinetics of the first order physico chemical reaction taking into account the phenomena of changes in bod and do i e advection diffusion and self purification of the river the general mathematical model takes the following form 49 x t div vx d x ax δ 0 in which x represents the bod do state vector δ density of the internal source which determines the intensity of production or absorption of the transferred agent d diffusion coefficient in isotropic environment v stream velocity matrix a bod do reaction coefficient matrix div means the divergence operator and gradient is the differential vector operator hilfer 2000 roohollah et al 2015 the above equation describes a three dimensional case of advection diffusion transport in time this means the transfer of substances bod do and spreading in the direction of decreasing concentration in practice some simplifications are accepted which allow for a simpler formulation of the eq 49 assuming moreover a conventional division of the river into sections and such values of parameters at which the diffusion share becomes small the equation of the mathematical model of a polluted river for the i th section is 50 t x i z t v i z z x i z t a i z x i z t w ri z t with limit conditions boundary condition bc x i 0 t m i x i 1 1 t w bi t r bi u bi t initial condition ic x i z t 0 x i 0 z i 1 n the solution of the above eq 50 can be reduced to ordinary differential equations using the method of characteristics the idea of this method is to write equations so that it is possible to use the properties occurring along the characteristic i e flow velocity characteristics are defined with the dependence 51 d dt z i t ν i z i t which causes that the eq 50 on the characteristics can be written as 52 d dt x z i t t a z i t x z i t t dw r z i t t where ic x z i t 0 t 0 x 0 z i 0 i 1 2 this means that the concentration of bod and do at the points defined by the dependence 51 will take the values determined by the right hand side of eq 50 boundary conditions disappear as the characteristics apply to the whole river if the flow in the river is fixed and uniform the method of characteristics leads to simpler equations calculation of the concentration of bod do for the heterogeneity of flow becomes more complicated it is interesting to solve the issue of state estimation using the method of characteristics with this approach it is assumed that measurements are also made along the characteristics and described as follows 53 y t cx t v p t where c 0 1 is the matrix x i t col x 1 t x 2 t is the state vector and v p t is the measurement disturbance it should be noted that the measurements are made only for the do indicator because the bod measurements are burdened with a long delay time in laboratory conditions of 5 20 days gomolka et al 2018 the issues of state estimation x t boil down to the search for a state estimate x t defined on the basis of measurements 53 minimizing the covariance matrix of the estimation error defined as 54 d dt x t a x t k f t y t c x t x t 0 0 where the filter amplification factor k f is determined by the formula 55 k f t p t c t v 1 where v is the measurement error covariance and the estimation error covariance matrix p t meets the riccati type differential equation 56 p t t ap t p t a t p t c t v 1 cp t dwd t with the initial condition p t 0 the matrix w is a covariance matrix of system disturbances w r occurring in the eq 50 therefore in order to obtain the state estimate x t first the riccati eq 56 should be solved then the filter amplification factor k f t dependence 55 should be determined and the estimate eq 54 should be solved such calculations must be carried out for each moment in time t the value of the estimate is corrected with a new measurement with amplification k f t the magnitude of this adjustment obviously depends on the difference between the current measurement and the corresponding coordinate of the state estimate it should be stressed that sometimes there may be a situation where for a large difference between the measurement and the estimate the adjustment will be small this is due to the low value of the filter amplification factor k f t the result of the eq 54 is indirectly dependent on the characteristics of stochastic signals affecting the tested object it may be difficult to determine these characteristics under real conditions that is why other solutions are being sought to eliminate these obstacles taking into account the above further considerations boil down to seeking an estimate of the state of the object defined by the eq 54 with the measurements 53 we predict that the estimate equation is determined by the relation 55 in which the properties of the water self purification process are taken into account by the elements of the matrix a in the eq 50 there is also an influence of system w and measurement vdisturbances in practice precise determination of the characteristics of these random signals requires a lot of work however this is necessary to determine the amplification factor k f by solving the riccati equation this difficulty can be avoided by applying an adaptive determination of this factor which will be presented in the next chapter of this paper 3 adaptive algorithm for the estimation of the state of a serial object when a river is polluted one way to reduce the negative impact on the biological life of the river is to react quickly and deliver oxygen directly to the water the paper gomolka et al 2018 proposes a complex river pollution control system using an intelligent analytical calculation module enabling continuous monitoring of two basic water quality indicators bod and do these indicators are of key importance for the assessment of the ecological status of river water and possible related risks to living organisms in the experimental part of the work the object for research on the state of pollution is the wislok river located in the south eastern part of poland the hydrological profile actual measurement data and the mathematical model of the river were used to estimate the difficult to measure variables necessary for pollution monitoring due to the fact that do measurement results are instantaneous and the measurement of bod parameter is difficult to achieve in real time an adaptive algorithm for the estimation of the state of a serial object has been applied to its determination in particular this paper presents the concept of an adaptive algorithm of filter amplification factor changes k f based on the kalman filter structure the proposed filter in a recursive way determines the estimate of the state vector of an object on the basis of measurements it should be noted that both the object and the measurements are subject to distorting signals the introduction of an adaptive algorithm allows to eliminate the inconveniences resulting from the need to estimate the characteristics of signals affecting the object under consideration these characteristics occur as excitation in a riccati equation with the classic approach these non linear differential equations are solved in order to determine the filter amplification factor a proprietary adaptive approach for the filter was proposed consisting in the current modification of its amplification factor k f simulation tests of these considerations were carried out for a model of a biochemically polluted river the essence of this approach is to apply the difference between the measurement and the corresponding coordinate of the state estimate to correct the value of the amplification factor this adjustment is made for each measurement moment and the update of the amplification value is carried out with an appropriate precautionary factor under these assumptions the constructed filter corrects the estimate value based on the next measurement and the current amplification value k f the adaptive algorithm modifies the filter amplification factor k f so that the estimation errors are reduced thus adjusting to the current operating conditions of the object adaptivity in the proposed filter consists in modification of the amplification factor k f the filter structure is similar to that of the kalman filter at any time of measurement depending on the currently determined state estimate the adjustment of amplification is carried out without knowledge of object and measurement disturbances and their characteristics even though they significantly affect the values of state and measurements fig 2 presents a proposed approach to the problem of determining the value of the filter amplification factor by means of an adaptive method in a dedicated intelligent filtration and prediction module bolanowski and byczek 2018 finotti et al 2012 gomolka et al 2018 oleksy et al 2018 paszkiewicz and iwaniec 2018 the idea of adaptation is to modify the kalman filter amplification k f on the basis of the difference between the measurement y t k and the current corresponding coordinate of the state estimate x t k in this approach a continuous change of k f is made line with the inflow of new measurements it should be remembered however that the modification k f takes place incrementally as well as the adjustment of weights while learning in neural networks the proposed algorithm assumes the knowledge of the initial values of filter amplification non zero amplification values and its modification takes place on the basis of current measurements and estimates only finotti et al 2012 giudice del and grillo 2019 kwater et al 2013 this means that the adaptation in the algorithm takes into account only current measurements modification takes place at the moment of measurement it should be noted that this mechanism is based on feedback in which the value of the estimate is used to update the filter amplification value k f and to determine the state estimation this is done in successive time steps in the presented algorithm listing 1 the initiallstate tk and initiallstateestimation functions concern solving the problem of state estimation using a filter subsequent steps in the algorithm are related to the calculation of the filter amplification factor using the incremental method a precise description of the determination of the estimation error and

representing the state of pollution of the river using the so called interpretation along the characteristics the state estimate is determined from the eq 11 in which the filter amplification factor k f is determined in an adaptive manner moreover it is assumed that the process under consideration representing the state of pollution of the river described by the mathematical model is affected by stochastic disturbances i e it is assumed that both the measurement and the model are burdened with an unknown disturbance signal gomolka et al 2018 kwater et al 2014 kwater and krutys 2010 in order to apply the idea of adaptability the difference between the measurement and the coordinate of the state estimate vector was used in this case it is the do indicator the error ε 0 t is specified by the relation 57 ε t y t x 2 t to calculate the amplification adjustment an error derivative was also used which takes the following form 58 d ε t 2 dt ε t 2 ε t 1 dt t 2 t 1 the error derivative acts as a kind of information about the behavior of the estimate error and allows to determine whether its tendency is decreasing or increasing in relation to the moment of the previous measurement the increment of the amplification factor dk f was assumed to be proportional to the current error ε and the adjustment of its value is made as in neural networks with the incremental method according to the relation 59 k f n k f p η dk f where k f n new value of the filter amplification factor dk f filter amplification increment k f p initial value of the filter amplification factor η change precautionary factor the idea of changes in filter amplification is represented by l12 in listing 1 an additional element influencing the filter amplification value is a factor called the change precautionary factor in this paper determines the part of the increment to be added to the initial value of the filter amplification factor the algorithm also takes into account the dependence of amplification adjustment dk f with a certain threshold of error value ε t the fragment of the program that makes changes in amplification depending on the error value and its derivative is given in

caution using the factor η with values in the range 0 1 in the case of large errors ε smaller values of the precautionary factor η are assumed which affect the stability of the algorithm the values of η in the algorithm were selected using the experimental method tabulating the error ε and factor η ranges the method of tabulation is based on expert knowledge 4 results and discussion the research was carried out by simulating a mathematical model in the form of ordinary differential equations they represent considerations of a biochemically contaminated river along the so called characteristics it was assumed that the indicators of water quality are bod and do expressed in units mg l the differential equations were solved with the runge kutta algorithm of the fourth order the initial conditions and the impact of continuous excitation interpreted as small lateral inflows of the river were adopted as preliminary assumptions this was achieved by means of a pseudo random signal of gaussian distribution simulation experiments were carried out for a wislok river with self purification feature located in the carpathian mountains in the south of poland in addition different initial values of the state x 0 and amplification factor k f were assumed 4 1 initial conditions of the estimate and the filter amplification factor filter equations generate estimates whose waveforms are consistent with the state vector change due to the fact that the do state variable is measured its estimate follows its changes faster and with lower error than the bod state estimate despite the low initial knowledge of the estimate the filter estimates to the value generated from the mathematical model see fig 3 table 1 presents the initial values used in the simulation selection of the initial values of the amplification factor may result in slight changes see figs 3 b and 4 other start values of the amplification factor if they are from the same range do not have a significant effect on the results of the estimation over a longer period of time greater a priori knowledge of the estimate results in a better quality of the estimate compare figs 3 a and 5 by starting the process with non zero estimates the time to achieve small estimation errors is significantly reduced the above figs 3 5 show the results of tests in which the values of the factor k f were calculated on the basis of the determined error defined by the formula 57 and its derivative 58 according to the proposed algorithm given in listing 2 4 2 changing the precautionary factor of the filter in the simulations the estimates were examined by a modified factor k f assuming different values of the precautionary parameter η and the value of the error threshold ε examples of the results of the obtained estimates are shown in fig 6 table 2 shows the values used in the conducted experiments as can be seen the estimate of the measurable polluted river indicator do runs according to the state characteristics of this coordinate on the other hand the second coordinate of the state vector bod is immeasurable and its estimate is also satisfactory and also follows its state the amplification factor determined in the course of calculations is characterized by a certain dynamics depending on the changing conditions of the object s functioning in fig 6 on the 10th day there are sudden changes in bod and do which are transferred to the reaction of the changes k f at the same time see fig 7 changing the error value ε in the adaptive algorithm has no significant influence on the results of the adaptation process because it is necessary that its values are small i e the difference between the coordinate measurement and the corresponding estimate is as small as possible of course extremely large ε can lead to constant values k f fig 8 shows the waveforms k f for the different factors η larger values η stabilize changes k f more 4 3 variants of modification of the adaptive filter amplification the proposed algorithm also makes it possible to take advantage of the dynamic growth of changes in the factor k f this change was conditioned by the dynamics of changes in the error ε with a certain caution η see fig 9 for large discrepancies between the estimate and the state measurements the dynamics of changes in the factor is noticeable the simulations also concerned cases of functioning of a simulated object with side inflows see fig 10 the initial values are summarized in table 3 despite sudden changes in the state vector value the estimation process with adaptive selection of the filter amplification proceeded correctly radical changes in amplification are a consequence of it 4 4 validation of adaptive algorithm operation the simulation tests conducted show that in each case the estimates follow the state while maintaining a similar characteristic of changes it is worth noting that the waveform of the do indicator estimate is almost identical to its state see fig 11 as mentioned earlier this is due to the fact that the measurement concerns this indicator sudden major changes in bod should be treated as polluted large lateral inflows it should be stressed that despite the lack of information about bod the filter managed to generate its estimate the tendency of which is correct for the state vector waveforms and its estimates from fig 11 the filter amplification assumed the values presented in fig 12 high values of this factor in the initial moments and around 15th and 30th hour of observation occur in places of large inflows i e where sudden changes in pollution occur simulation tests were carried out for various parameters e g the factor η and integration step dt were changed the simultaneous increase η and decrease dt does not result in significant changes however for a longer period of observation the state estimates are more accurate which can be seen among other things through a higher value of the filter amplification factor 5 conclusions the paper proposes an adaptive algorithm of state estimation with the structure as in the kalman filter where its amplification factor is calculated for each moment in time thanks to this the variable value of the filter amplification factor is a kind of response to the change in the characteristics of random signals the correct values of filter amplification should be such that it does not destabilize the overall solution and their changes are a kind of getting closer to the optimal kalman filter solutions the paper proposes a solution in which the original mechanism of determining the filter amplification factor is introduced in the process of estimation of the state of the object the properties of which indicate the seriality the most important challenge and at the same time the leading research element was the development of a new approach to algorithmic adaptation process in which it is possible to omit the need to determine the characteristics of excitation signals the use of the proposed adaptive algorithm to determine the value of the filter amplification factor allows to avoid the inconveniences resulting from the need to estimate the characteristics of signals affecting the object under investigation in this research task the following benefits were achieved as main contribuation mathematical models of the object described by ordinary or partial differential equations were formulated for the purpose of algorithm verification numerical methods were selected and appropriate simulation tests were carried out simulation tests of estimations with the use of the kalman filter were carried out an adaptive algorithm of filter amplification factor selection was proposed the adaptive algorithm was extended by the given observation horizon a number of studies were carried out taking into account the variability of parameters and working conditions of the adaptation mechanism on the basis of the proposed approach real systems can be designed to control the estimation of the state of the river this is extremely important for the control of such objects in particular where measurements of some of the state vector coordinates require laboratory service currently available technical means and methods allow the adaptation task to be carried out in a short period of time and with unknown interference characteristics the new adaptive algorithm proposed in this paper allows to obtain correct estimation of the state of an object functioning in conditions with unknown characteristics of stochastic

6595,one of the main problems of signal processing is the issue of estimation which consists in reproducing a useful signal on the basis of another one e g one burdened with unwanted interference the use of classical filtering to eliminate disturbances carries the risk of removing an important part of the information about the useful signal in order to avoid this phenomenon optimal filters are used utilizing the statistical properties of signals such a case of consideration concerns the issue of estimation for stochastic systems an example is the kalman filter in which the main aspect of research is the differential equation of the state estimate in which there is an amplification factor dependent on the covariance matrix of the estimation error the value of this factor is determined from the non linear riccati differential equation depending on the characteristics of signals affecting the object under investigation and the measurement the paper proposes an adaptive algorithm to determine the value of the filter amplification factor which allows to avoid the inconveniences resulting from the need to estimate the characteristics of signals affecting the object under investigation the presented approach to estimation issues does not require the need to characterize random signals due to the application of the adaptive method of state estimation the analyzed process refers to an object described by ordinary differential equations with continuous measurements representing the state of pollution of the river using the so called interpretation along the characteristics the method used in the module of the intelligent analytical system allows for quick determination of hard to measure parameters of the quality of water in the river and to react to upcoming ecological threats without any delays dangerous for the system keywords mathematical modeling kalman filter river parameter monitoring dedicated diagnostic system optimization algorithms 1 introduction in the previous decade scientific research was dominated by a variety of issues often related to optimization and operational research most often strictly formalized in a deterministic approach with the addition of probabilistic elements they were so called hard tasks in which the conditions of the problem including the purpose of actions models and limitations were precisely defined and determined a typical approach in this situation was to find the best solution or to develop options to support further decision making the methodology of solving this type of problems consisted rather in finding and using appropriate mathematical apparatus and applied identification of the form of the model together with its deterministic parameters meanwhile both the contemporary increase in the requirements formulated for research and the development of available methods and even the emergence of innovative concepts have resulted in the so called soft tasks the essence of which are probabilistic methods approximate sets uncertain variables fuzzy logic neural networks and adaptive algorithms they provide a highly diversified formal apparatus especially as the above mentioned methods can be combined kondratenko and kondratenko 2018 kozlov et al 2019 kwater et al 2014 trunov 2018 analyzing the related topics encountered in literature a review of research related to solving and implementation of the issues presented in this paper was carried out the methodology of solving systemic tasks has clearly changed its character from analytical mathematical methods to procedures related to the use of the latest computer techniques and numerical methods cimorelli et al 2019 dippner 2009 dudek dyduch 2018 khaki et al 2018 koczkodaj et al 2019 velasquez villada and donoso 2016 it should be stressed however that the essence of the matter here is not the development of traditional numerical methods supporting classical mathematical problems but above all the development of specialized algorithms i e computer techniques thanks to which the processes of automation of measurements and globalization of information systems are more effective gomolka et al 2017 kloeden and lorenz 2017 sufyan et al 2019 changes in the paradigm of scientific research especially in modeling phenomena of global significance are justified by the rapid development of new computer techniques using information available in networks and the methods of selection and choice of data romero et al 2001 paszkiewicz and bolanowski 2017 the issues considered in khaki et al 2018 indicate that in recent years molecular filters have been used with great success in the problems of state estimation the method proposed to determine the approximation error is called kullback leiblera distance kld fox 2003 its key element is a specific approximation error determined on the basis of a particle filter however the statistical approach to increasing the efficiency of particle filters by adjusting the size of sample sets in the error determination process is burdened with additional requirements in the form of higher computing power requirements a similar subject matter is presented in kasprzak 2000 in this work adaptive calculations and appropriate techniques are used to analyze sequences of digital images however the problem concerned the adaptation of dynamic sequences and appropriately designed algorithms where the solution is based on ann learning gomolka et al 2018 kwater and bartman 2017 kwater et al 2014 kwater and krutys 2010 such types of biologically justifiable methods can be used as a computational equivalent and mechanism of visual perception the implementation of this type of algorithm is included in the category of adaptive object recognition however the implementation of such an approach requires a learning process which involves the pre processing of learners data there are many approaches related to the use of adaptive mechanisms in the process of estimation of the state of an object presented in atamanyuk et al 2019 roohollah et al 2013 sufyan et al 2019 worrall et al 2014 inter alia in this paper the authors proposed a new algorithm which was verified on the basis of simulation tests and the implementation of which was based on the idea of mathematical modeling with the use of numerical methods and a digital computer the designed algorithm is focused on objects with a serial structure which include various types of heat exchangers pusher furnaces chemical reactors working in a serial system or polluted rivers in particular a model of a biochemically polluted river was adopted for consideration in the paper the issues of mathematical modeling of the polluted river phenomena have been discussed in many studies casulli and walters 2000 chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 plawiak and tadeusiewicz 2014 yu et al 2019 due to the complexity of the phenomena described models have different structure and degree of complexity the paper chen et al 2015 finotti et al 2012 presents numerical modeling of transient flows in the open trough network this applies in particular to well known and used in engineering practice one dimensional numerical models based on the system of saint venant equations two dimensional equations of shallow water are also increasingly used pakrashi 2019 the development of numerical methods and computational power of modern computers has made the algorithms of solving flow transformation equations widely available and there is no longer a barrier to the time of execution of calculations and the amount of data necessary to obtain a correct solution therefore when attempting to model a river section it is first of all necessary to make a decision on the choice of transformation equations and algorithms of their solution an important factor is the ability to obtain software that implements algorithms for solving flow transformation equations due to the criterion of recreating the state of the system and object parameters in the spatial variability model models are divided into two groups lumped parameter models distributed parameter models the first group of models uses single numerical values expressing the cumulative parameters of the object distributed parameter models on the other hand are characterized by spatial variability of parameters and reflect the same variability of the modeled object a similar approach is presented in casulli and walters 2000 where the model is built on the basis of finite differences in the implicit method on the basis of three dimensional shallow water equations and modified to use non structural grids this solution has many advantages but there are problems with complicated geometry the models obtained are relatively simple based on a mass balance practical numerical methods for solving two dimensional water equations have been formulated using a finite difference in spatial discretization in this paper a mathematical model of a biochemically polluted river described by differential equations of hyperbolic type with division into sections was designed for such a model a transformation was carried out consisting in the conversion of partial differential equations into a set of ordinary differential equations on the so called flow velocity characteristics such a transformation does not affect the accuracy of the description of phenomena one of the main problems of signal processing is the issue of estimation which consists in reproducing or determining the useful signal on the basis of another highly interfered signal the use of classical filtration to eliminate interference can cause the loss of a significant part of the signal causing its quality change in order to avoid this optimal filters can be used using statistical properties of signals such filters include the kalman filter that recursively determines the minimum variance estimate of the state vector of the linear model of a dynamic system based on measurements of the output of this system it is assumed that both the measurement and the operation of processing inside the system is burdened with an error of gaussian distribution such a case of consideration concerns the issue of estimation for stochastic systems the main aspect of research in the kalman filter is the differential equation of the state estimate in which there is an amplification factor dependent on the covariance matrix of estimation error in general the kalman filter generates satisfactory state estimation results provided that the characteristics of the excitation signals are correctly defined in some cases of signals it is difficult to determine their random characteristics e g when determining the influence of atmospheric phenomena as excitation on the condition of water reservoirs other approaches to estimation issues do not require the need to characterize random signals successful adaptation methods can be indicated here gomolka et al 2018 using the adaptive algorithm proposed in the paper to determine changes in the filter amplification factor it is possible to perform state estimation with unmeasured coordinates for a selected class of objects with efficiency comparable to or better than in the case of classical methods implementation time and computational complexity will be more advantageous than kalman s standard filter solution on the basis of the proposed approach real state estimation systems can be implemented this is extremely important for the control of such objects in particular where measurements of some of the state vector coordinates require laboratory service currently available technical means and methods allow the adaptation task to be carried out in a short period of time and with unknown interference characteristics 2 methods 2 1 estimation criterion using the gauss markov model in this chapter issues which describe the constructed mathematical model used in the simulation part of the paper will be presented the density of the distribution of conditional probability p x y x y where the value of y is determined and x is variable includes full information about x resulting from the fact that y y in many cases it is more convenient losing part of the information to be satisfied with some simpler characteristic than the function e g assuming a single estimate evaluation of value of x at y y arfken et al 2013 chiles and delfiner 2012 rue and held 2005 it is useful to use an estimate with the minimum variance for which there is an inequality for all functions z of variable y 1 e x x 2 y y e x z 2 y y where x means an estimate of the value taken by x knowing that y y the basic property of an estimate with the minimum variance is contained in theorem 1 theorem 1 let x and y 1 be random vectors of known cumulative distribution and let y be measured by taking the value y let x be the estimate of x with the minimum variance then x is unambiguously determined as conditional average value x for y y i e 2 x e x y y xp x y x y dx this theorem leads to yet another definition of the discussed estimate which is the conditional mean estimate giudice del and grillo 2019 khaki et al 2018 worrall et al 2014 the procedure described so far involving the use of a known numerical vector y to determine by means of the density of conditional probability distribution the numerical vector x called the estimate of x is the definition of a certain function which we denote as x the field of this function is a set of values y of a random variable y as a function of a random variable it is also a random variable the value x assumes is x i e 3 x y x e x y y it shows that 4 x e x y because the name estimate is used for specific value x of the random variable x that this variable assumes as a result of the random variable y assuming the value y x is called the estimator of x conditioned by the variable y fig 1 shows the difference between the estimate and the estimator the quantity x is an unbiased estimate when the expected conditional value of the error resulting from taking x as an estimate of x at a given y is equal to zero 5 e x y x x y y e x y x y y x 0 and 6 e x y x x y 0 in the linear estimator class the kalman filter gives the smallest unconditional covariance matrix of error therefore the mean squared error of estimation is minimal in general the kalman filter is a recursive algorithm for determining the state vector estimate of a dynamic system model using the measurements of this system giudice del and grillo 2019 khaki et al 2018 siwek and osowski 2016 sufyan et al 2019 ucinski and patan 2010 wu and chau 2010 the algorithm is based on minimizing the square of the estimation error moreover it presumes that the model under consideration is affected by stochastic disturbances i e it is assumed that both the measurement and the process of processing inside the model system is burdened with an error of gaussian distribution gomolka et al 2018 kwater et al 2014 kwater and krutys 2010 the result of this algorithm is a state estimate taking into account the estimation criterion which results in an optimal solution in practice it may happen that a measurement does not include all the coordinates of the state vector this means that only measurements of not all elements of the state vector are used to reconstruct the full state vector this effect is particularly useful in control systems where missing system information is obtained from disturbed and indirect measurements christensen 2011 gillespie 1977 considering the above let us consider a system with measurements described in the following form 7 x t ax t bu t lw t t t 0 8 y t cx t v t where a state matrix b control matrix l system disturbance actions matrix c measurement matrix in the eqs 7 and 8 signals y w and v are the measurements and white gaussian noises of zero mean value and with covariance matrices expressed as follows 9 e w t w τ q δ t τ q q t 0 10 e v t v τ r δ t τ r r t 0 the processes v and w are mutually independent therefore e w t v τ 0 t τ t 0 for the system defined by the eqs 7 10 we look for the estimate x of state x minimizing the estimation error 1 the solution to this problem is given in the form of a kalman filter equation which is a differential equation in the form of kwater and krutys 2010 lee et al 2012 and trunov 2018 11 x t a x t k f t y t c x t x t 0 0 where k f kalman filter s amplification factor y measurements the estimation error x is a stochastic process with zero mean value its covariance matrix meets the following matrix riccati differential equation 12 dp dt ap t p t a t p t c t r 1 cp t lql t t t 0 with the initial condition 13 p t 0 p 0 if you know the solution of the eq 12 you can determine the filter amplification factor k f which is determined by the relation 14 k f t p t c t r 1 therefore in order to determine k f it is necessary to know the matrix p ultimately in order to determine the state estimate it is necessary to solve two equations i e the filter equation and the riccati equation in the further part of the work the kalman filter will be used for the issue of estimation of the biochemical state of river pollution 2 2 characteristics of stochastic processes the function x a 1 a 2 a m is called a random function which for all values of arguments a 1 a 2 a m is a random variable in the theory of automatic control we usually encounter accidental functions of one argument which is time t we will call the random function x t of time t a stochastic process the stochastic process of x t is therefore a random time t function which is a random variable for each selected moment in time the fullest characteristic of the stochastic process is the n dimensional density function f x x 1 x 2 x n t 1 t 2 t n for n a one dimensional density function f x x t of a stochastic process x t describes the distribution of this process and is an exhaustive characteristic of this process whose values for different moments in time are independent random variables a stochastic process x t is called a normal gaussian process if a n dimensional vector of components x t 1 x t 2 x t n for any given moment in time t 1 t 2 t n and for any n is a random vector of normal distribution it follows from this relationship that the function of random vector density with a normal distribution is fully determined only by the first two moments of its components the first two moments of a random vector are in turn fully determined by the two dimensional density function the two dimensional density function is therefore an exhaustive characteristic of the normal stochastic process a stochastic process x t is called a markov process if for moments in time t 1 t 2 t n and for any i n the conditional density function f x x i t i x i 1 t i 1 of a random variable x t i depends only on the random variable x i 1 x t i 1 and not on the random variables x t 1 x t 2 x t i 2 the two dimensional density function defined in this way is an exhaustive characteristic of a markov process the moment initial ordinary

mutual correlation function of these processes is different from zero and uncorrelated if it is equal to the identity zero it can be demonstrated in a manner analogous to that of random variables that independent stochastic processes are uncorrelated uncorrelated normal stochastic processes are independent consider the sum of stochastic processes x 1 t x 2 t x n t 27 y t i 1 n x i t the expected

of this work an object representing water quality in water bodies and in particular in rivers was adopted the degree of water pollution can be determined by means of the so called quality indicators dobbins 1964 gomolka et al 2018 kwater et al 2014 kwater and krutys 2010 e g biochemical oxygen demand bod determining the amount of oxygen needed to oxidize organic compounds in water in biochemical processes under aerobic conditions the bod process can be described by the equation 47 dx 1 dt k 1 x 1 x 1 t 0 x 10 dissolved oxygen do as the temperature dependent concentration of dissolved oxygen in water describes the equation 48 dx 2 s dt k 2 x 1 k 3 x 2 n x 2 s a x 2 s t 0 x 20 where x 2 s mg l do concentration t day time k 2 rate coefficient of the bod influence on do k 3 rate coefficient of oxygen uptake from the atmosphere x 2 n mg l oxygen content in water at saturation a mg l day oxygen uptake intensity a detailed description of the bod and do indicators is described in gomolka et al 2018 kwater et al 2014 kwater and krutys 2010 and zhang et al 2018 the above indicators represent the concentration expressed in mg l the idea of a mathematical description of the quality of biochemically polluted water uses a model of a continuous stirred tank reactor in which there is a continuous flow it should be stressed that the oxygen consumption is assumed to be in accordance with the kinetics of the first order physico chemical reaction taking into account the phenomena of changes in bod and do i e advection diffusion and self purification of the river the general mathematical model takes the following form 49 x t div vx d x ax δ 0 in which x represents the bod do state vector δ density of the internal source which determines the intensity of production or absorption of the transferred agent d diffusion coefficient in isotropic environment v stream velocity matrix a bod do reaction coefficient matrix div means the divergence operator and gradient is the differential vector operator hilfer 2000 roohollah et al 2015 the above equation describes a three dimensional case of advection diffusion transport in time this means the transfer of substances bod do and spreading in the direction of decreasing concentration in practice some simplifications are accepted which allow for a simpler formulation of the eq 49 assuming moreover a conventional division of the river into sections and such values of parameters at which the diffusion share becomes small the equation of the mathematical model of a polluted river for the i th section is 50 t x i z t v i z z x i z t a i z x i z t w ri z t with limit conditions boundary condition bc x i 0 t m i x i 1 1 t w bi t r bi u bi t initial condition ic x i z t 0 x i 0 z i 1 n the solution of the above eq 50 can be reduced to ordinary differential equations using the method of characteristics the idea of this method is to write equations so that it is possible to use the properties occurring along the characteristic i e flow velocity characteristics are defined with the dependence 51 d dt z i t ν i z i t which causes that the eq 50 on the characteristics can be written as 52 d dt x z i t t a z i t x z i t t dw r z i t t where ic x z i t 0 t 0 x 0 z i 0 i 1 2 this means that the concentration of bod and do at the points defined by the dependence 51 will take the values determined by the right hand side of eq 50 boundary conditions disappear as the characteristics apply to the whole river if the flow in the river is fixed and uniform the method of characteristics leads to simpler equations calculation of the concentration of bod do for the heterogeneity of flow becomes more complicated it is interesting to solve the issue of state estimation using the method of characteristics with this approach it is assumed that measurements are also made along the characteristics and described as follows 53 y t cx t v p t where c 0 1 is the matrix x i t col x 1 t x 2 t is the state vector and v p t is the measurement disturbance it should be noted that the measurements are made only for the do indicator because the bod measurements are burdened with a long delay time in laboratory conditions of 5 20 days gomolka et al 2018 the issues of state estimation x t boil down to the search for a state estimate x t defined on the basis of measurements 53 minimizing the covariance matrix of the estimation error defined as 54 d dt x t a x t k f t y t c x t x t 0 0 where the filter amplification factor k f is determined by the formula 55 k f t p t c t v 1 where v is the measurement error covariance and the estimation error covariance matrix p t meets the riccati type differential equation 56 p t t ap t p t a t p t c t v 1 cp t dwd t with the initial condition p t 0 the matrix w is a covariance matrix of system disturbances w r occurring in the eq 50 therefore in order to obtain the state estimate x t first the riccati eq 56 should be solved then the filter amplification factor k f t dependence 55 should be determined and the estimate eq 54 should be solved such calculations must be carried out for each moment in time t the value of the estimate is corrected with a new measurement with amplification k f t the magnitude of this adjustment obviously depends on the difference between the current measurement and the corresponding coordinate of the state estimate it should be stressed that sometimes there may be a situation where for a large difference between the measurement and the estimate the adjustment will be small this is due to the low value of the filter amplification factor k f t the result of the eq 54 is indirectly dependent on the characteristics of stochastic signals affecting the tested object it may be difficult to determine these characteristics under real conditions that is why other solutions are being sought to eliminate these obstacles taking into account the above further considerations boil down to seeking an estimate of the state of the object defined by the eq 54 with the measurements 53 we predict that the estimate equation is determined by the relation 55 in which the properties of the water self purification process are taken into account by the elements of the matrix a in the eq 50 there is also an influence of system w and measurement vdisturbances in practice precise determination of the characteristics of these random signals requires a lot of work however this is necessary to determine the amplification factor k f by solving the riccati equation this difficulty can be avoided by applying an adaptive determination of this factor which will be presented in the next chapter of this paper 3 adaptive algorithm for the estimation of the state of a serial object when a river is polluted one way to reduce the negative impact on the biological life of the river is to react quickly and deliver oxygen directly to the water the paper gomolka et al 2018 proposes a complex river pollution control system using an intelligent analytical calculation module enabling continuous monitoring of two basic water quality indicators bod and do these indicators are of key importance for the assessment of the ecological status of river water and possible related risks to living organisms in the experimental part of the work the object for research on the state of pollution is the wislok river located in the south eastern part of poland the hydrological profile actual measurement data and the mathematical model of the river were used to estimate the difficult to measure variables necessary for pollution monitoring due to the fact that do measurement results are instantaneous and the measurement of bod parameter is difficult to achieve in real time an adaptive algorithm for the estimation of the state of a serial object has been applied to its determination in particular this paper presents the concept of an adaptive algorithm of filter amplification factor changes k f based on the kalman filter structure the proposed filter in a recursive way determines the estimate of the state vector of an object on the basis of measurements it should be noted that both the object and the measurements are subject to distorting signals the introduction of an adaptive algorithm allows to eliminate the inconveniences resulting from the need to estimate the characteristics of signals affecting the object under consideration these characteristics occur as excitation in a riccati equation with the classic approach these non linear differential equations are solved in order to determine the filter amplification factor a proprietary adaptive approach for the filter was proposed consisting in the current modification of its amplification factor k f simulation tests of these considerations were carried out for a model of a biochemically polluted river the essence of this approach is to apply the difference between the measurement and the corresponding coordinate of the state estimate to correct the value of the amplification factor this adjustment is made for each measurement moment and the update of the amplification value is carried out with an appropriate precautionary factor under these assumptions the constructed filter corrects the estimate value based on the next measurement and the current amplification value k f the adaptive algorithm modifies the filter amplification factor k f so that the estimation errors are reduced thus adjusting to the current operating conditions of the object adaptivity in the proposed filter consists in modification of the amplification factor k f the filter structure is similar to that of the kalman filter at any time of measurement depending on the currently determined state estimate the adjustment of amplification is carried out without knowledge of object and measurement disturbances and their characteristics even though they significantly affect the values of state and measurements fig 2 presents a proposed approach to the problem of determining the value of the filter amplification factor by means of an adaptive method in a dedicated intelligent filtration and prediction module bolanowski and byczek 2018 finotti et al 2012 gomolka et al 2018 oleksy et al 2018 paszkiewicz and iwaniec 2018 the idea of adaptation is to modify the kalman filter amplification k f on the basis of the difference between the measurement y t k and the current corresponding coordinate of the state estimate x t k in this approach a continuous change of k f is made line with the inflow of new measurements it should be remembered however that the modification k f takes place incrementally as well as the adjustment of weights while learning in neural networks the proposed algorithm assumes the knowledge of the initial values of filter amplification non zero amplification values and its modification takes place on the basis of current measurements and estimates only finotti et al 2012 giudice del and grillo 2019 kwater et al 2013 this means that the adaptation in the algorithm takes into account only current measurements modification takes place at the moment of measurement it should be noted that this mechanism is based on feedback in which the value of the estimate is used to update the filter amplification value k f and to determine the state estimation this is done in successive time steps in the presented algorithm listing 1 the initiallstate tk and initiallstateestimation functions concern solving the problem of state estimation using a filter subsequent steps in the algorithm are related to the calculation of the filter amplification factor using the incremental method a precise description of the determination of the estimation error and its derivative is presented in l10 in listing 1 the calculations are carried out for each measurement moment the end of the calculations is determined in l6 listing 1 listing 1 adaptive algorithm for

representing the state of pollution of the river using the so called interpretation along the characteristics the state estimate is determined from the eq 11 in which the filter amplification factor k f is determined in an adaptive manner moreover it is assumed that the process under consideration representing the state of pollution of the river described by the mathematical model is affected by stochastic disturbances i e it is assumed that both the measurement and the model are burdened with an unknown disturbance signal gomolka et al 2018 kwater et al 2014 kwater and krutys 2010 in order to apply the idea of adaptability the difference between the measurement and the coordinate of the state estimate vector was used in this case it is the do indicator the error ε 0 t is specified by the relation 57 ε t y t x 2 t to calculate the amplification adjustment an error derivative was also used which takes the following form 58 d ε t 2 dt ε t 2 ε t 1 dt t 2 t 1 the error derivative acts as a kind of information about the behavior of the estimate error and allows to determine whether its tendency is decreasing or increasing in relation to the moment of the previous measurement the increment of the amplification factor dk f was assumed to be proportional to the current error ε and the adjustment of its value is made as in neural networks with the incremental method according to the relation 59 k f n k f p η dk f where k f n new value of the filter amplification factor dk f filter amplification increment k f p initial value of the filter amplification factor η change precautionary factor the idea of changes in filter amplification is represented by l12 in listing 1 an additional element influencing the filter amplification value is a factor called the change precautionary factor in this paper determines the part of the increment to be added to the initial value of the filter amplification factor the algorithm also takes into account the dependence of amplification adjustment dk f with a certain threshold of error value ε t the fragment of the program that makes changes in amplification depending on the error value and its derivative is given in

caution using the factor η with values in the range 0 1 in the case of large errors ε smaller values of the precautionary factor η are assumed which affect the stability of the algorithm the values of η in the algorithm were selected using the experimental method tabulating the error ε and factor η ranges the method of tabulation is based on expert knowledge 4 results and discussion the research was carried out by simulating a mathematical model in the form of ordinary differential equations they represent considerations of a biochemically contaminated river along the so called characteristics it was assumed that the indicators of water quality are bod and do expressed in units mg l the differential equations were solved with the runge kutta algorithm of the fourth order the initial conditions and the impact of continuous excitation interpreted as small lateral inflows of the river were adopted as preliminary assumptions this was achieved by means of a pseudo random signal of gaussian distribution simulation experiments were carried out for a wislok river with self purification feature located in the carpathian mountains in the south of poland in addition different initial values of the state x 0 and amplification factor k f were assumed 4 1 initial conditions of the estimate and the filter amplification factor filter equations generate estimates whose waveforms are consistent with the state vector change due to the fact that the do state variable is measured its estimate follows its changes faster and with lower error than the bod state estimate despite the low initial knowledge of the estimate the filter estimates to the value generated from the mathematical model see fig 3 table 1 presents the initial values used in the simulation selection of the initial values of the amplification factor may result in slight changes see figs 3 b and 4 other start values of the amplification factor if they are from the same range do not have a significant effect on the results of the estimation over a longer period of time greater a priori knowledge of the estimate results in a better quality of the estimate compare figs 3 a and 5 by starting the process with non zero estimates the time to achieve small estimation errors is significantly reduced the above figs 3 5 show the results of tests in which the values of the factor k f were calculated on the basis of the determined error defined by the formula 57 and its derivative 58 according to the proposed algorithm given in listing 2 4 2 changing the precautionary factor of the filter in the simulations the estimates were examined by a modified factor k f assuming different values of the precautionary parameter η and the value of the error threshold ε examples of the results of the obtained estimates are shown in fig 6 table 2 shows the values used in the conducted experiments as can be seen the estimate of the measurable polluted river indicator do runs according to the state characteristics of this coordinate on the other hand the second coordinate of the state vector bod is immeasurable and its estimate is also satisfactory and also follows its state the amplification factor determined in the course of calculations is characterized by a certain dynamics depending on the changing conditions of the object s functioning in fig 6 on the 10th day there are sudden changes in bod and do which are transferred to the reaction of the changes k f at the same time see fig 7 changing the error value ε in the adaptive algorithm has no significant influence on the results of the adaptation process because it is necessary that its values are small i e the difference between the coordinate measurement and the corresponding estimate is as small as possible of course extremely large ε can lead to constant values k f fig 8 shows the waveforms k f for the different factors η larger values η stabilize changes k f more 4 3 variants of modification of the adaptive filter amplification the proposed algorithm also makes it possible to take advantage of the dynamic growth of changes in the factor k f this change was conditioned by the dynamics of changes in the error ε with a certain caution η see fig 9 for large discrepancies between the estimate and the state measurements the dynamics of changes in the factor is noticeable the simulations also concerned cases of functioning of a simulated object with side inflows see fig 10 the initial values are summarized in table 3 despite sudden changes in the state vector value the estimation process with adaptive selection of the filter amplification proceeded correctly radical changes in amplification are a consequence of it 4 4 validation of adaptive algorithm operation the simulation tests conducted show that in each case the estimates follow the state while maintaining a similar characteristic of changes it is worth noting that the waveform of the do indicator estimate is almost identical to its state see fig 11 as mentioned earlier this is due to the fact that the measurement concerns this indicator sudden major changes in bod should be treated as polluted large lateral inflows it should be stressed that despite the lack of information about bod the filter managed to generate its estimate the tendency of which is correct for the state vector waveforms and its estimates from fig 11 the filter amplification assumed the values presented in fig 12 high values of this factor in the initial moments and around 15th and 30th hour of observation occur in places of large inflows i e where sudden changes in pollution occur simulation tests were carried out for various parameters e g the factor η and integration step dt were changed the simultaneous increase η and decrease dt does not result in significant changes however for a longer period of observation the state estimates are more accurate which can be seen among other things through a higher value of the filter amplification factor 5 conclusions the paper proposes an adaptive algorithm of state estimation with the structure as in the kalman filter where its amplification factor is calculated for each moment in time thanks to this the variable value of the filter amplification factor is a kind of response to the change in the characteristics of random signals the correct values of filter amplification should be such that it does not destabilize the overall solution and their changes are a kind of getting closer to the optimal kalman filter solutions the paper proposes a solution in which the original mechanism of determining the filter amplification factor is introduced in the process of estimation of the state of the object the properties of which indicate the seriality the most important challenge and at the same time the leading research element was the development of a new approach to algorithmic adaptation process in which it is possible to omit the need to determine the characteristics of excitation signals the use of the proposed adaptive algorithm to determine the value of the filter amplification factor allows to avoid the inconveniences resulting from the need to estimate the characteristics of signals affecting the object under investigation in this research task the following benefits were achieved as main contribuation mathematical models of the object described by ordinary or partial differential equations were formulated for the purpose of algorithm verification numerical methods were selected and appropriate simulation tests were carried out simulation tests of estimations with the use of the kalman filter were carried out an adaptive algorithm of filter amplification factor selection was proposed the adaptive algorithm was extended by the given observation horizon a number of studies were carried out taking into account the variability of parameters and working conditions of the adaptation mechanism on the basis of the proposed approach real systems can be designed to control the estimation of the state of the river this is extremely important for the control of such objects in particular where measurements of some of the state vector coordinates require laboratory service currently available technical means and methods allow the adaptation task to be carried out in a short period of time and with unknown interference characteristics the new adaptive algorithm proposed in this paper allows to obtain correct estimation of the state of an object functioning in conditions with unknown characteristics of stochastic

6596,the theoretical examination of the combined effect of water table configuration and heat transfer is relevant to improve understanding of deep groundwater systems not only in siliciclastic sedimentary basins but also in fractured rocks or karstified carbonates numerical model calculations have been carried out to investigate the interaction of topography driven forced and buoyancy driven free thermal convection in a synthetic two dimensional model effects of numerous model parameters were systematically studied in order to examine their influence on the darcy flux the temperature and the hydraulic head field it was established that higher geothermal gradients and greater model depths facilitate the evolution of time dependent free thermal convection in agreement with changes of the thermal rayleigh number and the modified péclet number however increasing water table slope and anisotropy coefficient favor the formation of stationary forced thermal convection

changes from steady state to time dependent periodic then quasi periodic states numerical investigations suggested the existence of free thermal convection in sedimentary basins as an explanation for high surface heat flux straus and schubert 1977 the high geothermal gradient from borehole measurements in the sedimentary basin of tiszakécske great hungarian plain for example was explained as an upwelling part of a thermal convection cell by lenkey 1993 without taking into consideration topography driven groundwater flow in their pioneering study domenico and palciauskas 1973 were the first who investigated the relationship between topography driven groundwater flow and heat transfer theoretically they distinguished between two types of thermal convection they focused on only forced convection which may be taken to mean that flow is driven by an external force e g by topography variation of the water table while the effect of thermal buoyancy was neglected similarly an et al 2015 investigated temperature distribution in a simple and in a complex basin model of tóth 1963 in which groundwater flow was induced purely by water table variation that is they studied the effect of

steady state groundwater flow recognizing the importance of time dependent free thermal convection cserepes and lenkey 2004 completed a comprehensive systematic study to map the groundwater flow

in hungary according to this study in early evolutionary stages the groundwater flow system was dominated by free thermal convection ra 360 which was partially overwritten by topography driven flow after tectonic uplift of the buda block however the combined effect of the topography driven external force and the thermal buoyancy force has not been investigated comprehensively based on these preliminary considerations the main goal of the present study was the systematic numerical investigation of the combined effects of topography driven forced and buoyancy driven free thermal convection a simple two dimensional homogeneous isotropic model tóth 1962 was used as a base model in order to focus on the physics of the phenomenon the basic questions were as follows i what is the pattern of the interaction of two driving forces in the model basin ii how does this interaction influence the flow the temperature and the hydraulic head inducing over and underpressure stagnation point

fractured rocks and in karstified carbonate systems where the use of equivalent porous media epm approach is accepted e g lapcevic et al 1999 scanlon et al 2003 abusaada and sauter 2012 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 havril et al 2016 a simple two dimensional basin model similar to the original model of tóth 1962 was used as the isothermal base model the upper boundary was a linear slope of the water table as in the analytical solution found in robinson and love 2013 instead of a horizontal surface fig 1 a illustrates the applied homogeneous and isotropic base model with depth of d 3000 m width of l 6000 m and constant regional water table slope of γ 1 a simple linear water table was applied during the simulations to highlight the pure interaction of two driving forces i e the topography driven forced and the buoyancy driven free thermal convection the flow boundary conditions were no flow side and bottom boundaries while the water table was prescribed on the surface 6 h wt x tan γ where x denotes the horizontal coordinate and γ is the slope of the water table furthermore the side walls were assumed to be thermally insulated and an isothermal bottom boundary tb was prescribed the surface was considered as a thermally open boundary defined by the following relations 7 t t s if n q 0 inflow n q h 0 if n q 0 outflow where ts 10 c is the initial surface temperature n is the normal vector of the upper boundary pointing upward and qh denotes the surface heat flux the effect of different thermal boundary conditions for heat transfer e g lenkey 1993 domenico and palciauskas 1973 an et al 2015 han et al 2015 were tested and presented in the supplementary material the initial condition for the time dependent heat transfer problem was the conductive temperature distribution obtained from the stationary solution of eq 3 without the advection term q 0 in the course of the simulation four model parameters were systematically altered with the aim of revealing the influence of thermal convection on the flow system the first investigated parameter was 1 the temperature difference between the bottom and the surface of the model δt tb ts where δt varies from 0 to 50 c to study the role of thermal buoyancy further studied parameters were 2 the slope of the water table γ 0 5 3 the depth of the model d 500 5000 m and 4 the anisotropy coefficient of the hydraulic conductivity ε k xx k zz 0 1 100 the studied parameters are marked in bold in table 1 other model properties were kept constant during the simulation the effect of these tested model parameters on groundwater flow was quantified by the monitoring parameters such as average values of the darcy flux components the hydraulic head and the temperature table 2 the monitoring parameters characterize changes in flow pattern and temperature field additionally these parameters can be used to verify numerical models compared to measured head and temperature data the intensity of free thermal convection was characterized by the thermal non dimensional rayleigh number 8 ra k av c w d φ λ w 1 φ λ m ρ w t s ρ w t b where ra is approximated by the water density difference between the upper and bottom boundary temperatures rabinowicz et al 1998 and the average hydraulic conductivity is 9 k av k xx k zz which represents the geometric mean of diagonal elements of the hydraulic conductivity tensor e g zhang et al 2007 the system of partial differential equations given by eqs 1 3 was solved using the finite element numerical modeling software package comsol multiphysics 5 2 zimmermann 2006 to compute the pressure the temperature and the two components of the darcy flux the two dimensional model domain was discretized by triangular elements with non uniform size fig 1b the maximum element size was 10 m in the model domain which was reduced to 5 m along the boundaries to handle the high temperature gradient for example in the thermal boundary layer tbl the final mesh had 588 521 finite elements in the base model fig 1 the solution within the elements was approximated by quadratic lagrangian polynomial functions generally time dependent simulations were performed at time scales ranging from t 0 to 5 106 days d 13 7 kiloyears kyr except for the investigation of the effect of anisotropy this range proved sufficient to yield a stationary or quasi stationary solution in the first period t 105 d 0 274 kyr the time step increased exponentially but thereafter remained constant at 1000d the time dependent calculation for a given model run required approx 1 7 days cpu time and 10 20 gb memory on an intel 2 79 ghz processor based workstation 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of temperature difference the temperature difference between the bottom and the surface of the model δt was systematically increased to investigate the combined effect of the driving forces of water table variation and heat transfer on the groundwater flow first this influence on the temperature distribution is displayed in fig 2 which shows the conductive initial temperature field at t 0d and δt 20 c fig 2a and temperature snapshots at time t 11kyr increasing δt from 20 c to 140 c fig 2b h fig 3 parallel to fig 2b d f and h illustrates the distribution of the hydraulic head h left and the hydraulic head difference between the calculated and the isothermal head at δt 0 c δh h h 0 right to show the influence of free thermal convection on head values in the course of the investigation the hydraulic head was determined according to the following formula 10 h p ρ w t g z where z denotes the vertical coordinate initially the temperature of the pore water is determined by conduction over the entire numerical model then is modified by topography driven groundwater flow with the applied model parameters table 1 the groundwater system converged towards a stationary solution when the temperature difference was δt 60 c fig 2b and c in these cases the heat was advected toward the discharge area dominantly by topography driven flow so the effect of free thermal convection seemed negligible compared to that of forced convection which displays a certain similarity to the solution obtained by domenico and palciauskas 1973 and an et al 2015 consequently the groundwater temperature beneath the recharge area was much lower than beneath the discharge area closely approximating the surface temperature the groundwater flow pattern was also characterized by a midline separating the recharge and discharge areas in the case of the isothermal base model as established by tóth 1962 and is illustrated by streamlines in fig 3b at δt 20 c due to topography driven flow the temperature distribution increases non linearly with depth and forced convection causes continuous hot upwelling beneath the discharge area which is in agreement with the steady state solutions of smith and chapman 1983 and an et al 2015 the flow system shows a pattern similar to that of the isothermal base model thus the hydraulic head maximum hmax 104 73 m is located at the highest point of the water table fig 3a at a temperature difference of δt 60 c a stationary equilibrium evolved as a thermal hot upwelling plume developed beneath the recharge area here thermal buoyancy is induced by the hot low density water upwelling from the bottom tbl elder 1968 turcotte and schubert 2002 which is balanced by the topography driven sinking cold water eq 2 a close relationship can be recognized between the positive temperature anomaly and the hydraulic head see fig 2d and 3c d modification of the groundwater flow system was especially evident within the long lived right hand side plume where a local stationary convection cell developed consequently the location of the maximum hydraulic head moved from the water table maximum to the tbl and its value increased by about 27 m fig 3c however the development of this steady state local circulation did not cause any significant regional change in the flow pattern except in the deeper zone of the recharge area in this model the approximate value of ra was around 960 when the first effect of free thermal convection was seen a time dependent flow system formed in scenarios in which δt was 70 c ra 1183 a pulsating long lived hot plume evolved beneath the recharge area as a result of the formation of a dynamic equilibrium between the hot buoyant upwelling and cold dense downwelling water the vertical movement of the plume became faster and more complex with increasing δt which influenced the instability of the tbl therefore free thermal convection promoted the formation of smaller hot upwellings these in turn were swept towards the discharge area by the regional groundwater flow due to the open thermal boundary condition the heat could transfer across the surface of the discharge area generally due to the vigorous time dependent thermal convection the hydraulic head h and its difference from the solution in the isothermal base model δh were significantly modified fig 3e h especially in the deeper zone of the model basin and beneath the recharge area where the previously mentioned large convection cell evolved beneath the discharge area forced and free thermal convection are superimposed producing a permanent but time variable upwelling in addition the maximum point of the hydraulic head migrated along the bottom of the model in tbl under the recharge zone even reaching a value of hmax 276 m at δt 140 c approx 171 m higher than in the isothermal base model fig 3g free thermal convection was seen to qualitatively modify the effect of forced convection not only through the temperature field but also through the heads and the flow pattern in some parts of the basin however further calculations were required to investigate the time dependent behavior of the numerical model in detail in fig 4 the analysis of the time series is shown over a time interval of t 0 13 7 kyr at various temperature differences δt ranging between 0 and 140 c in the isothermal base model δt 0 c the monitoring curves illustrate the steady state flow system similarly stationary solutions were obtained for all parameters when δt 60 c after the transient time period t 5 48 kyr while the initial conduction generated temperature field fig 2a was considerably altered by forced thermal convection e g fig 2b as thermal buoyancy was enhanced with increased δt the average temperature hydraulic head and velocity components except for qr converged to higher values time dependent solutions were found when the temperature difference was δt 60 c beyond the transient behavior the monitoring parameters tended towards a quasi stationary solution higher δt intensified the flow heated the model up and increased the hydraulic head fig 4c and d and e represent the magnitude and the fluctuation of the darcy fluxes due to the continuous upwelling beneath the discharge area the pulsation of the long lived plume beneath the recharge area and the horizontal drift of the evolving plumes at the bottom tbl respectively the fluctuation of qr is much more pronounced than that of the other time series which represents the competition between the cold downwelling and the rising hot plume it should be noted that the quasi stationary average temperature developed in the numerical models is much lower than the initial temperature fig 4b owing to the effective advective cooling furnished by forced convection the slight increase in the average temperature also resulted in an increase in the hydraulic head fig 4f for instance differences from the average hydraulic head in the isothermal base model h 0 52 m are about 3 m and 10 m at δt 60 c and 140 c respectively the gradient of the fitted curve changed at about δt 60 c in the average temperature and hydraulic head when the solution is still stationary but a new hot plume emerged beneath the recharge zone fig 2d the change in the darcy flux occurs rather at δt 70 c at which point free convection produces a time dependent flow free convection induces further hot plumes rising from the bottom tbl which can reach the surface before they merge into the left continuous upwelling decreasing the buoyancy force and the vertical velocity along the left hand side of the model this mechanism causes the decrease in the rate of the curve fitted on ql values fig 5 c particular attention was given to the position of maximum hydraulic head hmax which was noticed at the water table maximum when δt 50 c that is when forced thermal convection governs the steady state system in the scenarios in which the temperature and flow field were considerably modified δt 60 c the position of the maximum head migrated to the bottom of the basin near the right hand side upwelling e g fig 3c and d the position of hmax always coincides with the contours where the horizontal darcy flux is zero black contour left and the streamline touches the bottom boundary grey contours right this proves that for a regime influenced by free thermal convection hmax is situated at a local downwelling within the bottom tbl which separates the flow toward the recharge and the discharge zones as a divergent stagnation point or a zone in the flow system fig 6 a illustrates the horizontal position of the maximum head x hmax at several temperature differences as a function of time fig 6b shows the time averaged position of x hmax with its standard deviation as free thermal convection intensifies the position seems inclined to move toward the midline zone which might be the final state with negligible forced convection fig 3a c e g after studying the time series of the monitoring parameters the variation in the hydraulic head was used to facilitate the determination of the rate of the two different driving forces fig 3 right side shows the hydraulic head difference compared to the purely topography driven isothermal solution δh h h 0 generally δh reaches 40 100 m or even 100 218 m near the tbl and inside the large plumes where significant changes in groundwater flow are also noticed e g right bottom corner fig 7 a and b show the relative area where the head has increased by at least 10 or 50 respectively owing to temperature to be more exact a 10 and a 50 denote the area related to the area of the model domain in which 11 ξ 100 h h 0 1 exceeds 10 or 50 respectively the thermal convection forced and or free increases the head difference degrees and either modifies ξ 10 or dominates ξ 50 the flow clearly in isothermal models there is no head difference i e a 10 a 50 0 the relative area of the model domain where the hydraulic head is higher than that in the isothermal model by at least 10 a 10 is shown in fig 7a the figure indicates that at a temperature difference of δt 20 c the hydraulic head increases over approx 6 of the area of the model domain due to thermal convection this value reaches 37 for δt 150 c the transition from a forced convection dominated to a free convection dominated state is seen at δt 60 70 c but a linear function can be fitted onto the interval δt 10 150 c the relative area of the model dominated by thermal convection a 50 fig 7b exceeds 2 at δt 40 c and reaches 21 5 at δt 150 c the linear function was fitted over temperature differences ranging from 30 c to 150 c the transition between the two types of convection can be detected only in the increased standard deviation the inset in fig 7 emphasizes that significant hydraulic head differences exist around the pulsing plume beneath the recharge area in the area surrounding the edge of the discharge zone and in the deeper parts of the midline zone in the upper part of the recharge and midline areas the water table variation drives the groundwater flow in the homogeneous isotropic model finally it should be noted that thermal convection results not only in head increases due to the formation of a positive temperature anomaly as was shown in fig 3 right but also results in head decreases fig 8 illustrates the head differences where these values are negative δh 0 and snapshots were taken of several temperature differences in stationary solutions fig 8a and b the negative anomalies 0 1m are located near the plume roots cf fig 2b and d due to the conservation of mass hot plumes strengthened by thermal buoyancy need some extra fluid which is drawn away from the topography driven flow system producing local head minima thus these minima represent local downwellings compared to the situation noticed in the isothermal simulation this can also be seen in the time variable systems fig 8c and d hot plumes are fed by local downwellings and the necessary extra mass is stolen from the topography driven groundwater flow system resulting in head minima in the areas surrounding plume roots in an evolving strongly time dependent flow system fig 8d the head decrease 0 25 m can be explained only by the dynamic effect of free thermal convection 3 2 effect of the water table slope both theoretical analyses and field observations suggest that the variation in water table slope is the most obvious parameter which is able to influence the hydrogeological processes in sedimentary basins e g freeze and witherspoon 1966 1967 tóth 2009 yang et al 2010 robinson and love 2013 therefore the slope angle of the linear water table eq 6 was systematically varied from γ 0 to 5 while the temperature difference between the bottom and the surface was fixed at δt 100 c to investigate the impact of increasing regional relief on the groundwater flow system fig 9 depicts temperature snapshots at time t 11kyr and different values of γ without any water table differences fig 9a the effect of forced convection does not exist thus the flow pattern is controlled by pure free thermal convection in the case of γ 0 five large plumes with a characteristic distance of 1200 m evolve after the transient period t 5 48 kyr this value is considerably shorter than the wavelength of the instability at the onset of free thermal convection 2 73d 8190 m determined by lapwood 1948 the discrepancy is explained by 1 the rayleigh number for the model significantly exceeds the critical value ra 2003 racr 27 1 and 2 the upper boundary is thermally open the flow and temperature field is time dependent thermal instabilities initiate from the bottom tbl drift and merge into quasi stationary hot upwellings with increasing γ forced thermal convection appears and can modify the temperature and darcy velocity field plumes are retained and a cold domain widens in the midline zone for the model of γ 5 forced thermal convection dominates the system producing two stationary upwellings along the model sides this solution is analogous to the model of γ 1 and δt 60 c fig 2d the flow system is similar to the isothermal solution apart from the bottom corners of the model domain and the maximum hydraulic head jumps back to the highest point of the water table hmax 525 m for γ 5 fig 10 shows the time averaged value and the standard deviation of the time series of the darcy flux qav the average temperature tav and the average hydraulic head difference between the numerical and the isothermal model δhav for a horizontal water table γ 0 the darcy flux is approx 5 10 8 m s and is generated purely by buoyancy forces fig 10a as γ increases the role of forced convection increases darcy flux values tend to a linear curve which is in agreement with qav grad p γ in eq 2 at least for small values of γ a higher water table slope results in lower average temperature since enhanced forced thermal convection sweeps out the heat from the model fig 10b the average hydraulic head data are not shown because they vary with γ and so the dynamic effects are overshadowed thus fig 10c illustrates the average head difference from the isothermal models for lower values of γ the hydraulic head difference increases suggesting that free and forced thermal convection act coherently and δhav reaches about 8 m at γ 1 however at values of γ 1 δhav decreases owing to the reduced plume flux and tends to zero the standard deviation of the computed monitoring parameters decreases with γ as the groundwater flow system approaches steady state condition 3 3 effect of model depth another crucial parameter which significantly influences the flow system in a non isothermal model is the depth of the model domain in our simulations the model depth was varied in the interval of d 500 5000 m while the temperature gradient between the bottom and the surface was constant δt d 33 3 c km to keep comparability with the reference model d 3000 m γ 1 and δt 100 c see fig 2f the water table slope was fixed as well at γ 1 fig 11 illustrates the effect of the growing model depth on the temperature field for shallower model domains with d 2000 m the solution is steady state where forced thermal convection due to topography driven flow prevails over the system resulting in one hot upwelling within the discharge zone as the model deepens and ra increases owing to the growing water density difference and model depth time dependent free thermal convection appears then starts dominating the groundwater flow at least qualitatively the averaged time series of qav tav and hav quantify the impact of the model depth on the monitoring parameters fig 12 first the darcy flux decreases with d since the flow is less intense in a deeper model domain fig 12a and b however when free thermal convection appears d 2500 m ra 1284 the rate of the decrease slows then reverts to a slight increase because thermal buoyancy predominates over a greater proportion of the model domain especially in the deep zones fig 11c and d the average model temperature increases slightly in the stationary forced thermal convection regime d 2000 m fig 12b when free thermal convection begins the gradient of the fitted linear curve becomes steeper reflecting warming in the deep mid line zone and beneath the recharge area the trend of average hydraulic head is similar to the temperature variation fig 12c which confirms that the reduction in water density due to the temperature increase is responsible for the head growth nevertheless the standard deviation of the time series reflects the variability of the system due to time dependent free thermal convection 3 4 effect of anisotropy of hydraulic conductivity the anisotropy of the hydraulic conductivity ε kxx kzz can reach 100 1000 in siliciclastic sedimentary basins depending on the stratification of clayey and sandy layers grain orientation etc however the anisotropy in fractured carbonates is usually quite different because 1 large anisotropy rates are less probable due to the more homogeneous matrix composition and 2 a ratio of ε 1 can occur as well owing to vertical fracturing thus the effect of the anisotropy ratio was studied in the range of ε 0 1 100 since an increase of anisotropy slows down the flow considerably the length of simulations was increased depending on ε to obtain a quasi stationary solution other parameters correspond to the reference model fig 2f it is clear based on fig 13 that an anisotropy of ε 1 facilitates vertical groundwater flow which favors buoyancy driven free thermal convection over forced convection as ε increases i e vertical hydraulic conductivity decreases free thermal convection is repressed by topography driven flow the high darcy flux zone narrows toward the surface where the flow is dominantly horizontal in the deeper domain sluggish periodic ε 20 fig 13e or almost stationary convection ε 100 fig 13f forms the two flow systems separate in the homogeneous model where the upper part of the model is controlled by topography driven flow while the lower part is governed by buoyancy driven flow with increasing ε the head maxima decrease as a dynamic consequence of the slowing flow the averaged darcy flux time series support the qualitative observation that the high anisotropy retains the flow fig 14 on the average darcy flux data a 1 ε function was fitted since qav kav kxx ε see eqs 2 and 9 the average temperature and in parallel the average hydraulic head both increase with ε the model domain becomes warmer owing to the sluggish flow in the deeper zone separation of the topography and buoyancy driven flow system at about ε 5 is distinctly visible in fig 14b and c the values of tav and hav depend strongly on the type of flow regime which evolves in the deep zone either quasi periodic characterized with lower temperatures and heads ε 5 20 a slow moving sluggish with system higher temperatures and heads ε 10 50 or an almost stationary system with low standard deviation ε 100 last we note that on the one hand the maximum head decreases with ε due to the slowing flow dynamic effect fig 13 on the other hand the average head increases with ε thermal effect fig 14c 3 5 modified péclet number where the equivalent porous media approach is valid the quantitative evaluation of the combined effect of forced and free thermal convection requires the use e g patankar 1980 clauser and villinger 1990 and or the definition of a non dimensional number therefore besides the thermal rayleigh number the non dimensional modified péclet number was defined which facilitates the classification of the flow systems into forced and free thermal convection dominated state with respect to advective convective and conductive transport processes 12 pe ρ w t c w δ q d φ λ w 1 φ λ m where δq is the magnitude of darcy flux reduced by the purely topography driven isothermal δt 0 c darcy flux δq qav q 0 fig 15 illustrates the rayleigh number ra as a function of the modified péclet number pe for the evaluation of all the simulated scenarios transition from steady state forced thermal convection to time dependent free thermal convection appeared when the rayleigh and the modified péclet number were ra 500 1100 and pe 10 20 respectively below these intervals the flow systems converge towards a steady state solution and forced convection is the dominant driving force fig 2b d fig 9d fig 11a b fig 13e and f but above that time dependent free thermal convection intensifies the flow in the model basin fig 2e d fig 9a c fig 11c d fig 13a d former interval means that the rayleigh number is more than one order of magnitude higher than the critical value determined by lapwood 1948 latter represents that free thermal convection is expected when the darcy flux obtained from non isothermal model exceeds the darcy flux obtained from isothermal model by at least one order of magnitude 3 6 effect of no flow side boundaries finally the influence of the side walls as no flow boundaries was investigated impermeable side walls stabilize the flow and facilitate formation of stable upwellings along the boundaries beneath discharge areas and often beneath recharge areas in order to eliminate this effect three domains were compiled into one model including a divide and a valley fig 16 other model parameters were the same as in the homogeneous isotropic reference model γ 1 d 3000 m δt 100 c and ε 1 fig 2f beneath the inner divide x 12000 m neither a permanent nor an oscillating hot plume forms but initial upwellings move left or right toward the inner or the outer valley respectively plumes evolve and lengthen while they drift toward the discharge zones beneath the inner valley x 6000 m plumes from the divides group and merge to arise in the main upwelling zone however their positions are not fixed plumes forming along no flow boundaries x 0 and 18000 m show similar shapes as in the individual domain models clearly no flow side boundaries affect the time dependent pattern of the flow and temperature field however their impact on the behavior of the system and the averaged monitoring parameters is not significant fig 14 shows the deviation in the averaged darcy flux temperature and hydraulic head values between the complex black circle and the reference red cross ε 1 model 4 summary and conclusions finite element numerical model calculations were performed to investigate how buoyancy driven free thermal convection influences topography driven forced thermal convection in a synthetic groundwater basin in order to focus on the combined process a simple two dimensional homogeneous model domain was chosen with a linear water table slope in which the single variable material property was the water density depending on the temperature the model simulation could also be applied as theoretical physical experiments to understand processes occurring in siliciclastic sedimentary basins fractured rocks or karstified carbonate systems first the temperature difference between the bottom and the surface δt was varied due to increasing geothermal gradient the flow became more intense and the change from forced thermal convection to a free thermal convection regime induced a significant increase in the gradient of the monitoring parameters fig 5 the relative area modified dominated by free thermal convection was enhanced δt fig 7 compared to the isothermal base model δt 0 c the hydraulic head increased with δt due to the decreasing water density conversely negative head differences also appeared which can be explained only by the dynamic effect of the enhanced plume activity fig 8 as a result of the increased temperature difference intensive time dependent free thermal convection evolved in the model basin the effect of the change of the slope of the water table within the range of γ 0 5 at a constant temperature difference δt 100 c was also investigated as γ increased purely free thermal convection governed flow transformed into forced thermal convection dominated flow as a consequence the topography driven groundwater flow intensified the darcy flux resulting in effective advective cooling fig 10 in other words an increase in the water table slope facilitates forced thermal convection nevertheless a simple linear water table was applied in the model but this simplification helps to highlight the transition between free and forced thermal convection and likely does not affect the transitional behavior the influence of depth of the model domain d was next investigated while maintaining a uniform geothermal gradient 100 c km for shallower model depths d 2500 m stationary topography driven thermal convection characterized the system however for deeper models the groundwater flow system became time dependent due to the appearance of free thermal convection deeper models at constant geothermal gradient favor free thermal convection the anisotropy of the hydraulic conductivity ε kxx kzz was varied within ε 0 1 100 including both values of ε 1 representing e g carbonates with vertical fractures and values of ε 1 characterizing e g siliciclastic basins with mild and moderate anisotropy on the one hand increasing ε hinders vertical flow and suppresses free thermal convection due to reduced vertical hydraulic conductivity on the other hand higher anisotropy enforces topography driven groundwater flow into the shallower region which helps the separation of the two flow regimes fig 13 in this study the flow system was investigated within a wide range of δt γ d and ε values corresponding to the thermal rayleigh numbers ra 0 6336 and the modified péclet numbers pe 0 323 the effect of time dependent free thermal convection only appeared in our simulations when ra 500 1100 and pe 10 20 fig 15 nevertheless in sedimentary basins combined topography and buoyancy driven groundwater flow system evolves at even infinitesimally low temperature differences if the water table slope is γ 0 the removing of artificial no flow boundaries at the side walls helped to elucidate their effect on the flow and temperature pattern by horizontally connecting the individual model domains although the flow and the temperature patterns changed in the complex model the dynamics of the flow system and the quantitative character remained uniform fig 16 in the homogeneous model the position of the maximum hydraulic head hmax is always located at the highest point of the water level or within the bottom tbl in the latter case the position of hmax corresponds to a divergent stagnation point tóth 1988 1999 jiang et al 2011 wang et al 2011 which moves and or skips in the time dependent system a local downwelling overlies this point which is characterized by a local head minimum as a zone through which hot plumes are fed by water finally we need to mention that the effects of numerous parameters and phenomena could not be investigated in this paper which could modify the conclusions e g model geometry dispersion heterogeneity temperature dependent viscosity boundary conditions etc some of these effects are discussed in the supplementary material we found that the effect of temperature dependent viscosity intensifies the flow and facilitates free thermal convection on the other hand constant heat flux prescribed at the bottom boundary reduces flow system complexity and favors forced thermal convection moreover we noted that the recharge rate in the simple base model is overestimated 5m yr however the decrease of water table slope and the increase of anisotropy coefficient significantly reduces this recharge to an acceptable real range e g 0 1 0 3 m yr for γ 0 1 and ε 10 see table s2 in the supplementary material if we adapt the model results for real geological situations the appearance of time dependent thermal convection cannot be excluded in inverted basins beside the effect of gravity driven

6596,the theoretical examination of the combined effect of water table configuration and heat transfer is relevant to improve understanding of deep groundwater systems not only in siliciclastic sedimentary basins but also in fractured rocks or karstified carbonates numerical model calculations have been carried out to investigate the interaction of topography driven forced and buoyancy driven free thermal convection in a synthetic two dimensional model effects of numerous model parameters were systematically studied in order to examine their influence on the darcy flux the temperature and the hydraulic head field it was established that higher geothermal gradients and greater model depths facilitate the evolution of time dependent free thermal convection in agreement with changes of the thermal rayleigh number and the modified péclet number however increasing water table slope and anisotropy coefficient favor the formation of stationary forced thermal convection free thermal convection mainly affects the deeper part of the midline and the discharge zone of the synthetic model in the examined model basins the position of the maximum hydraulic head is located within the bottom thermal boundary layer near the recharge zone this divergent stagnation point underlies a local downwelling zone characterized by underpressure these simulations draw attention to the importance of understanding the combined effect of forced and free thermal convection in sedimentary basins regarding regional groundwater flow patterns and temperature distributions keywords

homogeneous and isotropic model domains with a permeable surface no free thermal convection takes place due to buoyancy forces when the thermal rayleigh number ra is lower than the critical value ra racr 27 1 at values slightly above the critical rayleigh number stationary two dimensional thermal convection forms in a porous layer elder 1967 as ra increases the form of the thermal convection changes from steady state to time dependent periodic then quasi periodic states numerical investigations suggested the existence of free thermal convection in sedimentary basins as an explanation for high surface heat flux straus and schubert 1977 the high geothermal gradient from borehole measurements in the sedimentary basin of tiszakécske great hungarian plain for example was explained as an upwelling part of a thermal convection cell by lenkey 1993 without taking into consideration topography driven groundwater flow in their pioneering study domenico and palciauskas 1973 were the first who investigated the relationship between topography driven groundwater flow and heat transfer theoretically they distinguished between two types of thermal convection they focused on only forced convection which may be taken to mean that flow is driven by an external force e g by topography variation of the water table while the effect of thermal buoyancy was neglected similarly an et al 2015 investigated temperature distribution in a simple and in a complex basin model of tóth 1963 in which groundwater flow was induced purely by water table variation that is they studied the effect of forced convection the interaction of topography driven forced and buoyancy driven free thermal convection on the surface heat flux was analyzed in a synthetic model by smith and chapman 1983 only in steady state groundwater flow recognizing the importance of time dependent free thermal convection cserepes and lenkey 2004 completed a comprehensive systematic study to map the groundwater flow pattern as functions of the slope of the topography and the thermal rayleigh number the increasing effect of topography driven forced convection was investigated in a conceptual model at low water table slope and low rayleigh number by yang et al 2010 they concluded that when the darcy flux generated by free thermal convection exceeds the darcy flux from forced convection a mixed free and forced convection evolves in the system the effect of forced and free thermal convection was investigated numerically by raffensperger and vlassopoulos 1999 in a sedimentary basin where the dominance of steady state groundwater flow was noticed because of the low rayleigh numbers ra 100 for the rheingraben clauser and villinger 1990 presented a complete case study including forced and free thermal convection by two dimensional numerical simulations based on regional scale numerical simulations and field observations lopez et al 2016 proved the existence of time dependent forced and free mixed thermal convection in a heterogeneous siliciclastic formation of the lake chad basin ra 380 in this case the blocks of the basin were separated by faults which strongly influencing the location the path and the intensity of thermal convection similar to previous studies by yang et al 2004 2006 in the deeper parts of the carbonate aquifers the enhanced temperature gradient observations can suggest the presence of forced convection e g pasquale et al 2013 numerical simulations have been carried out to compare the temperature distribution caused by thermal convection with observed temperature depth profiles and elucidate temperature anomalies and flow patterns in the deep carbonate platform of luttelgeest in the netherlands lipsey et al 2016 the groundwater flow system in confined and unconfined carbonate regions has also been studied e g goldscheider et al 2010 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 mádl szőnyi et al 2017 where the importance of free thermal convection was mentioned semi synthetic numerical simulations were carried out on a basin scale model by havril et al 2016 to qualitatively understand the evolving hydrodynamic flow system of the buda thermal karst in hungary according to this study in early evolutionary stages the groundwater flow system was dominated by free thermal convection ra 360 which was partially overwritten by topography driven flow after tectonic uplift of the buda block however the combined effect of the topography driven external force and the thermal buoyancy force has not been investigated comprehensively based on these preliminary considerations the main goal of the present study was the systematic numerical investigation of the combined effects of topography driven forced and buoyancy driven free thermal convection a simple two dimensional homogeneous isotropic model tóth 1962 was used as a base model in order to focus on the physics of the phenomenon the basic questions were as follows i what is the pattern of the interaction of two driving forces in the model basin ii how does this interaction influence the flow the temperature and the hydraulic head inducing over and underpressure stagnation point skipping etc over the course of this theoretical experiment four model parameters were systematically altered 1 the temperature difference between the bottom and the surface of the model 2 the model depth 3 the slope of the water table and 4 the anisotropy of the hydraulic conductivity for the simulated scenarios changes in the non dimensional rayleigh and modified péclet number were also followed to study the transition between stationary forced and time dependent free thermal convection 2 model description and definition of monitoring parameters in order to investigate the combined effect of regional scale forced and free thermal convection in a synthetic groundwater flow basin the equations of continuity darcy s law and heat transfer bear and verruijt 1987 nield and bejan 2017

where the reference water density is ρr 1000 kg m3 at a reference temperature of tr 4 c the effect of the temperature dependent viscosity of pore water was not investigated within the framework of the recent study but its effect on the phenomena is presented in the supplementary material although using darcy s law is conventional in the case of a siliciclastic porous basin it can also be used in fractured rocks and in karstified carbonate systems where the use of equivalent porous media epm approach is accepted e g lapcevic et al 1999 scanlon et al 2003 abusaada and sauter 2012 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 havril et al 2016 a simple two dimensional basin model similar to the original model of tóth 1962 was used as the isothermal base model the upper boundary was a linear slope of the water table as in the analytical solution found in robinson and love 2013 instead of a horizontal surface fig 1 a illustrates the applied homogeneous and isotropic base model with depth of d 3000 m width of l 6000 m and constant regional water table slope of γ 1 a simple linear water table was applied during the simulations to highlight the pure interaction of two driving forces i e the topography driven forced and the buoyancy driven free thermal convection the flow boundary conditions were no flow side and bottom boundaries while the water table was prescribed on the surface 6 h wt x tan γ where x denotes the horizontal coordinate and γ is the slope of the water table furthermore the side walls were assumed to be thermally insulated and an isothermal bottom boundary tb was prescribed the surface was considered as a thermally open boundary defined by the following relations 7 t t s if n q 0 inflow n q h 0 if n q 0 outflow where ts 10 c is the initial surface temperature n is the normal vector of the upper boundary pointing upward and qh denotes the surface heat flux the effect of different thermal boundary conditions for heat transfer e g lenkey 1993 domenico and palciauskas 1973 an et al 2015 han et al 2015 were tested and presented in the supplementary material the initial condition for the time dependent heat transfer problem was the conductive temperature distribution obtained from the stationary solution of eq 3 without the advection term q 0 in the course of the simulation four model parameters were systematically altered with the aim of revealing the influence of thermal convection on the flow system the first investigated parameter was 1 the temperature difference between the bottom and the surface of the model δt tb ts where δt varies from 0 to 50 c to study the role of thermal buoyancy further studied parameters were 2 the slope of the water table γ 0 5 3 the depth of the model d 500 5000 m and 4 the anisotropy coefficient of the hydraulic conductivity ε k xx k zz 0 1 100 the studied parameters are marked in bold in table 1 other model properties were kept constant during the simulation the effect of these tested model parameters on groundwater flow was quantified by the monitoring parameters such as average values of the darcy flux components the hydraulic head and the temperature table 2 the monitoring parameters characterize changes in flow pattern and temperature field additionally these parameters can be used to verify numerical models compared to measured head and temperature data the intensity of free thermal convection was characterized by the thermal non dimensional rayleigh number 8 ra k av c w d φ λ w 1 φ λ m ρ w t s ρ w t b where ra is approximated by the water density difference between the upper and bottom boundary temperatures rabinowicz et al 1998 and the average hydraulic conductivity is 9 k av k xx k zz which represents the geometric mean of diagonal elements of the hydraulic conductivity tensor e g zhang et al 2007 the system of partial differential equations given by eqs 1 3 was solved using the finite element numerical modeling software package comsol multiphysics 5 2 zimmermann 2006 to compute the pressure the temperature and the two components of the darcy flux the two dimensional model domain was discretized by triangular elements with non uniform size fig 1b the maximum element size was 10 m in the model domain which was reduced to 5 m along the boundaries to handle the high temperature gradient for example in the thermal boundary layer tbl the final mesh had 588 521 finite elements in the base model fig 1 the solution within the elements was approximated by quadratic lagrangian polynomial functions generally time dependent simulations were performed at time scales ranging from t 0 to 5 106 days d 13 7 kiloyears kyr except for the investigation of the effect of anisotropy this range proved sufficient to yield a stationary or quasi stationary solution in the first period t 105 d 0 274 kyr the time step increased exponentially but thereafter remained constant at 1000d the time dependent calculation for a given model run required approx 1 7 days cpu time and 10 20 gb memory on an intel 2 79 ghz processor based workstation 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of temperature difference the temperature difference between the bottom and the surface of the model δt was systematically increased to investigate the combined effect of the driving forces of water table variation and heat transfer on the groundwater flow first this influence on the temperature distribution is displayed in fig 2 which shows the conductive initial temperature field at t 0d and δt 20 c fig 2a and temperature snapshots at time t 11kyr increasing δt from 20 c to 140 c fig 2b h fig 3 parallel to fig 2b d f and h illustrates the distribution of the hydraulic head h left and the hydraulic head difference between the calculated and the isothermal head at δt 0 c δh h h 0 right to show the influence of free thermal convection on head values in the course of the investigation the hydraulic head was determined according to the following formula 10 h p ρ w t g z where z denotes the vertical coordinate initially the temperature of the pore water is determined by conduction over the entire numerical model then is modified by topography driven groundwater flow with the applied model parameters table 1 the groundwater system converged towards a stationary solution when the temperature difference was δt 60 c fig 2b and c in these cases the heat was advected toward the discharge area dominantly by topography driven flow so the effect of free thermal convection seemed negligible compared to that of forced convection which displays a certain similarity to the solution obtained by domenico and palciauskas 1973 and an et al 2015 consequently the groundwater temperature beneath the recharge area was much lower than beneath the discharge area closely approximating the surface temperature the groundwater flow pattern was also characterized by a midline separating the recharge and discharge areas in the case of the isothermal base model as established by tóth 1962 and is illustrated by streamlines in fig 3b at δt 20 c due to topography driven flow the temperature distribution increases non linearly with depth and forced convection causes continuous hot upwelling beneath the discharge area which is in agreement with the steady state solutions of smith and chapman 1983 and an et al 2015 the flow system shows a pattern similar to that of the isothermal base model thus the hydraulic head maximum hmax 104 73 m is located at the highest point of the water table fig 3a at a temperature difference of δt 60 c a stationary equilibrium evolved as a thermal hot upwelling plume developed beneath the recharge area here thermal buoyancy is induced by the hot low density water upwelling from the bottom tbl elder 1968 turcotte and schubert 2002 which is balanced by the topography driven sinking cold water eq 2 a close relationship can be recognized between the positive temperature anomaly and the hydraulic head see fig 2d and 3c d modification of the groundwater flow system was especially evident within the long lived right hand side plume where a local stationary convection cell developed consequently the location of the maximum hydraulic head moved from the water table maximum to the tbl and its value increased by about 27 m fig 3c however the development of this steady state local circulation did not cause any significant regional change in the flow pattern except in the deeper zone of the recharge area in this model the approximate value of ra was around 960 when the first effect of free thermal convection was seen a time dependent flow system formed in scenarios in which δt was 70 c ra 1183 a pulsating long lived hot plume evolved beneath the recharge area as a result of the formation of a dynamic equilibrium between the hot buoyant upwelling and cold dense downwelling water the vertical movement of the plume became faster and more complex with increasing δt which influenced the instability of the tbl therefore free thermal convection promoted the formation of smaller hot upwellings these in turn were swept towards the discharge area by the regional groundwater flow due to the open thermal boundary condition the heat could transfer across the surface of the discharge area generally due to the vigorous time dependent thermal convection the hydraulic head h and its difference from the solution in the isothermal base model δh were significantly modified fig 3e h especially in the deeper zone of the model basin and beneath the recharge area where the previously mentioned large convection cell evolved beneath the discharge area forced and free thermal convection are superimposed producing a permanent but time variable upwelling in addition the maximum point of the hydraulic head migrated along the bottom of the model in tbl under the recharge zone even reaching a value of hmax 276 m at δt 140 c approx 171 m higher than in the isothermal base model fig 3g free thermal convection was seen to qualitatively modify the effect of forced convection not only through the temperature field but also through the heads and the flow pattern in some parts of the basin however further calculations were required to investigate the time dependent behavior of the numerical model in detail in fig 4 the analysis of the time series is shown over a time interval of t 0 13 7 kyr at various temperature differences δt ranging between 0 and 140 c in the isothermal base model δt 0 c the monitoring curves illustrate the steady state flow system similarly stationary solutions were obtained for all parameters when δt 60 c after the transient time period t 5 48 kyr while the initial conduction generated temperature field fig 2a was considerably altered by forced thermal convection e g fig 2b as thermal buoyancy was enhanced with increased δt the average temperature hydraulic head and velocity components except for qr converged to higher values time dependent solutions were found when the temperature difference was δt 60 c beyond the transient behavior the monitoring parameters tended towards a quasi stationary solution higher δt intensified the flow heated the model up and increased the hydraulic head fig 4c and d and e represent the magnitude and the fluctuation of the darcy fluxes due to the continuous upwelling beneath the discharge area the pulsation of the long lived plume beneath the recharge area and the horizontal drift of the evolving plumes at the bottom tbl respectively the fluctuation of qr is much more pronounced than that of the other time series which represents the competition between the cold downwelling and the rising hot plume it should be noted that the quasi stationary average temperature developed in the numerical models is much lower than the initial temperature fig 4b owing to the effective advective cooling furnished by forced convection the slight increase in the average temperature also resulted in an increase in the hydraulic head fig 4f for instance differences from the average hydraulic head in the isothermal base model h 0 52 m are about 3 m and 10 m at δt 60 c and 140 c respectively the gradient of the fitted curve changed at about δt 60 c in the average temperature and hydraulic head when the solution is still stationary but a new hot plume emerged beneath the recharge zone fig 2d the change in the darcy flux occurs rather at δt 70 c at which point free convection produces a time dependent flow free convection induces further hot plumes rising from the bottom tbl which can reach the surface before they merge into the left continuous upwelling decreasing the buoyancy force and the vertical velocity along the left hand side of the model this mechanism causes the decrease in the rate of the curve fitted on ql values fig 5 c particular attention was given to the position of maximum hydraulic head hmax which was noticed at the water table maximum when δt 50 c that is when forced thermal convection governs the steady state system in the scenarios in which the temperature and flow field were considerably modified δt 60 c the position of the maximum head migrated to the bottom of the basin near the right hand side upwelling e g fig 3c and d the position of hmax always coincides with the contours where the horizontal darcy flux is zero black contour left and the streamline touches the bottom boundary grey contours right this proves that for a regime influenced by free thermal convection hmax is situated at a local downwelling within the bottom tbl which separates the flow toward the recharge and the discharge zones as a divergent stagnation point or a zone in the flow system fig 6 a illustrates the horizontal position of the maximum head x hmax at several temperature differences as a function of time fig 6b shows the time averaged position of x hmax with its standard deviation as free thermal convection intensifies the position seems inclined to move toward the midline zone which might be the final state with negligible forced convection fig 3a c e g after studying the time series of the monitoring parameters the variation in the hydraulic head was used to facilitate the determination of the rate of the two different driving forces fig 3 right side shows the hydraulic head difference compared to the purely topography driven isothermal solution δh h h 0 generally δh reaches 40 100 m or even 100 218 m near the tbl and inside the large plumes where significant changes in groundwater flow are also noticed e g right bottom corner fig 7 a and b show the relative area where the head has increased by at least 10 or 50 respectively owing to temperature to be more exact a 10 and a 50 denote the area related to the area of the model domain in which 11 ξ 100 h h 0 1 exceeds 10 or 50 respectively the thermal convection forced and or free increases the head difference degrees and either modifies ξ 10 or dominates ξ 50 the flow clearly in isothermal models there is no head difference i e a 10 a 50 0 the relative area of the model domain where the hydraulic head is higher than that in the isothermal model by at least 10 a 10 is shown in fig 7a the figure indicates that at a temperature difference of δt 20 c the hydraulic head increases over approx 6 of the area of the model domain due to thermal convection this value reaches 37 for δt 150 c the transition from a forced convection dominated to a free convection dominated state is seen at δt 60 70 c but a linear function can be fitted onto the interval δt 10 150 c the relative area of the model dominated by thermal convection a 50 fig 7b exceeds 2 at δt 40 c and reaches 21 5 at δt 150 c the linear function was fitted over temperature differences ranging from 30 c to 150 c the transition between the two types of convection can be detected only in the increased standard deviation the inset in fig 7 emphasizes that significant hydraulic head differences exist around the pulsing plume beneath the recharge area in the area surrounding the edge of the discharge zone and in the deeper parts of the midline zone in the upper part of the recharge and midline areas the water table variation drives the groundwater flow in the homogeneous isotropic model finally it should be noted that thermal convection results not only in head increases due to the formation of a positive temperature anomaly as was shown in fig 3 right but also results in head decreases fig 8 illustrates the head differences where these values are negative δh 0 and snapshots were taken of several temperature differences in stationary solutions fig 8a and b the negative anomalies 0 1m are located near the plume roots cf fig 2b and d due to the conservation of mass hot plumes strengthened by thermal buoyancy need some extra fluid which is drawn away from the topography driven flow system producing local head minima thus these minima represent local downwellings compared to the situation noticed in the isothermal simulation this can also be seen in the time variable systems fig 8c and d hot plumes are fed by local downwellings and the necessary extra mass is stolen from the topography driven groundwater flow system resulting in head minima in the areas surrounding plume roots in an evolving strongly time dependent flow system fig 8d the head decrease 0 25 m can be explained only by the dynamic effect of free thermal convection 3 2 effect of the water table slope both theoretical analyses and field observations suggest that the variation in water table slope is the most obvious parameter which is able to influence the hydrogeological processes in sedimentary basins e g freeze and witherspoon 1966 1967 tóth 2009 yang et al 2010 robinson and love 2013 therefore the slope angle of the linear water table eq 6 was systematically varied from γ 0 to 5 while the temperature difference between the bottom and the surface was fixed at δt 100 c to investigate the impact of increasing regional relief on the groundwater flow system fig 9 depicts temperature snapshots at time t 11kyr and different values of γ without any water table differences fig 9a the effect of forced convection does not exist thus the flow pattern is controlled by pure free thermal convection in the case of γ 0 five large plumes with a characteristic distance of 1200 m evolve after the transient period t 5 48 kyr this value is considerably shorter than the wavelength of the instability at the onset of free thermal convection 2 73d 8190 m determined by lapwood 1948 the discrepancy is explained by 1 the rayleigh number for the model significantly exceeds the critical value ra 2003 racr 27 1 and 2 the upper boundary is thermally open the flow and temperature field is time dependent thermal instabilities initiate from the bottom tbl drift and merge into quasi stationary hot upwellings with increasing γ forced thermal convection appears and can modify the temperature and darcy velocity field plumes are retained and a cold domain widens in the midline zone for the model of γ 5 forced thermal convection dominates the system producing two stationary upwellings along the model sides this solution is analogous to the model of γ 1 and δt 60 c fig 2d the flow system is similar to the isothermal solution apart from the bottom corners of the model domain and the maximum hydraulic head jumps back to the highest point of the water table hmax 525 m for γ 5 fig 10 shows the time averaged value and the standard deviation of the time series of the darcy flux qav the average temperature tav and the average hydraulic head difference between the numerical and the isothermal model δhav for a horizontal water table γ 0 the darcy flux is approx 5 10 8 m s and is generated purely by buoyancy forces fig 10a as γ increases the role of forced convection increases darcy flux values tend to a linear curve which is in agreement with qav grad p γ in eq 2 at least for small values of γ a higher water table slope results in lower average temperature since enhanced forced thermal convection sweeps out the heat from the model fig 10b the average hydraulic head data are not shown because they vary with γ and so the dynamic effects are overshadowed thus fig 10c illustrates the average head difference from the isothermal models for lower values of γ the hydraulic head difference increases suggesting that free and forced thermal convection act coherently and δhav reaches about 8 m at γ 1 however at values of γ 1 δhav decreases owing to the reduced plume flux and tends to zero the standard deviation of the computed monitoring parameters decreases with γ as the groundwater flow system approaches steady state condition 3 3 effect of model depth another crucial parameter which significantly influences the flow system in a non isothermal model is the depth of the model domain in our simulations the model depth was varied in the interval of d 500 5000 m while the temperature gradient between the bottom and the surface was constant δt d 33 3 c km to keep comparability with the reference model d 3000 m γ 1 and δt 100 c see fig 2f the water table slope was fixed as well at γ 1 fig 11 illustrates the effect of the growing model depth on the temperature field for shallower model domains with d 2000 m the solution is steady state where forced thermal convection due to topography driven flow prevails over the system resulting in one hot upwelling within the discharge zone as the model deepens and ra increases owing to the growing water density difference and model depth time dependent free thermal convection appears then starts dominating the groundwater flow at least qualitatively the averaged time series of qav tav and hav quantify the impact of the model depth on the monitoring parameters fig 12 first the darcy flux decreases with d since the flow is less intense in a deeper model domain fig 12a and b however when free thermal convection appears d 2500 m ra 1284 the rate of the decrease slows then reverts to a slight increase because thermal buoyancy predominates over a greater proportion of the model domain especially in the deep zones fig 11c and d the average model temperature increases slightly in the stationary forced thermal convection regime d 2000 m fig 12b when free thermal convection begins the gradient of the fitted linear curve becomes steeper reflecting warming in the deep mid line zone and beneath the recharge area the trend of average hydraulic head is similar to the temperature variation fig 12c which confirms that the reduction in water density due to the temperature increase is responsible for the head growth nevertheless the standard deviation of the time series reflects the variability of the system due to time dependent free thermal convection 3 4 effect of anisotropy of hydraulic conductivity the anisotropy of the hydraulic conductivity ε kxx kzz can reach 100 1000 in siliciclastic sedimentary basins depending on the stratification of clayey and sandy layers grain orientation etc however the anisotropy in fractured carbonates is usually quite different because 1 large anisotropy rates are less probable due to the more homogeneous matrix composition and 2 a ratio of ε 1 can occur as well owing to vertical fracturing thus the effect of the anisotropy ratio was studied in the range of ε 0 1 100 since an increase of anisotropy slows down the flow considerably the length of simulations was increased depending on ε to obtain a quasi stationary solution other parameters correspond to the reference model fig 2f it is clear based on fig 13 that an anisotropy of ε 1 facilitates vertical groundwater flow which favors buoyancy driven free thermal convection over forced convection as ε increases i e vertical hydraulic conductivity decreases free thermal convection is repressed by topography driven flow the high darcy flux zone narrows toward the surface where the flow is dominantly horizontal in the deeper domain sluggish periodic ε 20 fig 13e or almost stationary convection ε 100 fig 13f forms the two flow systems separate in the homogeneous model where the upper part of the model is controlled by topography driven flow while the lower part is governed by buoyancy driven flow with increasing ε the head maxima decrease as a dynamic consequence of the slowing flow the averaged darcy flux time series support the qualitative observation that the high anisotropy retains the flow fig 14 on the average darcy flux data a 1 ε function was fitted since qav kav kxx ε see eqs 2 and 9 the average temperature and in parallel the average hydraulic head both increase with ε the model domain becomes warmer owing to the sluggish flow in the deeper zone separation of the topography and buoyancy driven flow system at about ε 5 is distinctly visible in fig 14b and c the values of tav and hav depend strongly on the type of flow regime which evolves in the deep zone either quasi periodic characterized with lower temperatures and heads ε 5 20 a slow moving sluggish with system higher temperatures and heads ε 10 50 or an almost stationary system with low standard deviation ε 100 last we note that on the one hand the maximum head decreases with ε due to the slowing flow dynamic effect fig 13 on the other hand the average head increases with ε thermal effect fig 14c 3 5 modified péclet number where the equivalent porous media approach is valid the quantitative evaluation of the combined effect of forced and free thermal convection requires the use e g patankar 1980 clauser and villinger 1990 and or the definition of a non dimensional number therefore besides the thermal rayleigh number the non dimensional modified péclet number was defined which facilitates the classification of the flow systems into forced and free thermal convection dominated state with respect to advective convective and conductive transport processes 12 pe ρ w t c w δ q d φ λ w 1 φ λ m where δq is the magnitude of darcy flux reduced by the purely topography driven isothermal δt 0 c darcy flux δq qav q 0 fig 15 illustrates the rayleigh number ra as a function of the modified péclet number pe for the evaluation of all the simulated scenarios transition from steady state forced thermal convection to time dependent free thermal convection appeared when the rayleigh and the modified péclet number were ra 500 1100 and pe 10 20 respectively below these intervals the flow systems converge towards a steady state solution and forced convection is the dominant driving force fig 2b d fig 9d fig 11a b fig 13e and f but above that time dependent free thermal convection intensifies the flow in the model basin fig 2e d fig 9a c fig 11c d fig 13a d former interval means that the rayleigh number is more than one order of magnitude higher than the critical value determined by lapwood 1948 latter represents that free thermal convection is expected when the darcy flux obtained from non isothermal model exceeds the darcy flux obtained from isothermal model by at least one order of magnitude 3 6 effect of no flow side boundaries finally the influence of the side walls as no flow boundaries was investigated impermeable side walls stabilize the flow and facilitate formation of stable upwellings along the boundaries beneath discharge areas and often beneath recharge areas in order to eliminate this effect three domains were compiled into one model including a divide and a valley fig 16 other model parameters were the same as in the homogeneous isotropic reference model γ 1 d 3000 m δt 100 c and ε 1 fig 2f beneath the inner divide x 12000 m neither a permanent nor an oscillating hot plume forms but initial upwellings move left or right toward the inner or the outer valley respectively plumes evolve and lengthen while they drift toward the discharge zones beneath the inner valley x 6000 m plumes from the divides group and merge to arise in the main upwelling zone however their positions are not fixed plumes forming along no flow boundaries x 0 and 18000 m show similar shapes as in the individual domain models clearly no flow side boundaries affect the time dependent pattern of the flow and temperature field however their impact on the behavior of the system and the averaged monitoring parameters is not significant fig 14 shows the deviation in the averaged darcy flux temperature and hydraulic head values between the complex black circle and the reference red cross ε 1 model 4 summary and conclusions finite element numerical model calculations were performed to investigate how buoyancy driven free thermal convection influences topography driven forced thermal convection in a synthetic groundwater basin in order to focus on the combined process a simple two dimensional homogeneous model domain was chosen with a linear water table slope in which the single variable material property was the water density depending on the temperature the model simulation could also be applied as theoretical physical experiments to understand processes occurring in siliciclastic sedimentary basins fractured rocks or karstified carbonate systems first the temperature difference between the bottom and the surface δt was varied due to increasing geothermal gradient the flow became more intense and the change from forced thermal convection to a free thermal convection regime induced a significant increase in the gradient of the monitoring parameters fig 5 the relative area modified dominated by free thermal convection was enhanced δt fig 7 compared to the isothermal base model δt 0 c the hydraulic head increased with δt due to the decreasing water density conversely negative head differences also appeared which can be explained only by the dynamic effect of the enhanced plume activity fig 8 as a result of the increased temperature difference intensive time dependent free thermal convection evolved in the model basin the effect of the change of the slope of the water table within the range of γ 0 5 at a constant temperature difference δt 100 c was also investigated as γ increased purely free thermal convection governed flow transformed into forced thermal convection dominated flow as a consequence the topography driven groundwater flow intensified the darcy flux resulting in effective advective cooling fig 10 in other words an increase in the water table slope facilitates forced thermal convection nevertheless a simple linear water table was applied in the model but this simplification helps to highlight the transition between free and forced thermal convection and likely does not affect the transitional behavior the influence of depth of the model domain d was next investigated while maintaining a uniform geothermal gradient 100 c km for shallower model depths d 2500 m stationary topography driven thermal convection characterized the system however for deeper models the groundwater flow system became time dependent due to the appearance of free thermal convection deeper models at constant geothermal gradient favor free thermal convection the anisotropy of the hydraulic conductivity ε kxx kzz was varied within ε 0 1 100 including both values of ε 1 representing e g carbonates with vertical fractures and values of ε 1 characterizing e g siliciclastic basins with mild and moderate anisotropy on the one hand increasing ε hinders vertical flow and suppresses free thermal convection due to reduced vertical hydraulic conductivity on the other hand higher anisotropy enforces topography driven groundwater flow into the shallower region which helps the separation of the two flow regimes fig 13 in this study the flow system was investigated within a wide range of δt γ d and ε values corresponding to the thermal rayleigh numbers ra 0 6336 and the modified péclet numbers pe 0 323 the effect of time dependent free thermal convection only appeared in our simulations when ra 500 1100 and pe 10 20 fig 15 nevertheless in sedimentary basins combined topography and buoyancy driven groundwater flow system evolves at even infinitesimally low temperature differences if the water table slope is γ 0 the removing of artificial no flow boundaries at the side walls helped to elucidate their effect on the flow and temperature pattern by horizontally connecting the individual model domains although the flow and the temperature patterns changed in the complex model the dynamics of the flow system and the quantitative character remained uniform fig 16 in the homogeneous model the position of the maximum hydraulic head hmax is always located at the highest point of the water level or within the bottom tbl in the latter case the position of hmax corresponds to a divergent stagnation point tóth 1988 1999 jiang et al 2011 wang et al 2011 which moves and or skips in the time dependent system a local downwelling overlies this point which is characterized by a local head minimum as a zone through which hot plumes are fed by water finally we need to mention that the effects of numerous parameters and phenomena could not be investigated in this paper which could modify the conclusions e g model geometry dispersion heterogeneity temperature dependent viscosity boundary conditions etc some of these effects are discussed in the supplementary material we found that the effect of temperature dependent viscosity intensifies the flow and facilitates free thermal convection on the other hand constant heat flux prescribed at the bottom boundary reduces flow system complexity and favors forced thermal convection moreover we noted that the recharge rate in the simple base model is overestimated 5m yr however the decrease of water table slope and the increase of anisotropy coefficient significantly reduces this recharge to an acceptable real range e g 0 1 0 3 m yr for γ 0 1 and ε 10 see table s2 in the supplementary material if we adapt the model results for real geological situations the appearance of time dependent thermal convection cannot be excluded in inverted basins beside the effect of gravity driven groundwater flow in areas where the geothermal gradient exceeds the mean value e g due to the thin lithosphere approx 50 c km in the pannonian basin lenkey et al 2002 2017 unsteady free thermal convection is likely to occur in deep karstified carbonates havril et al 2016 or in faulted siliciclastic basins lopez et al 2016 the effect of free thermal convection can be observed in the vertical temperature distribution of deep carbonate regions e g in the buda thermal karst where the temperature anomalies cannot be explained by either conduction or pure forced thermal convection mádl szőnyi et al 2018 the results of the numerical simulations for the combined effect of forced and free thermal convection can be validated using basin scale data evaluation methods such as temperature elevation t z pressure elevation p z and total dissolved solids elevation tds z profile e g tóth 2009 mádl szőnyi and tóth 2015 mádl szőnyi et al 2017 combined topography and buoyancy driven groundwater flow in sedimentary basins can thus be characterized by very complex and time dependent head and temperature patterns which complicate the processes e g planning of an optimal geothermal

6597,designing effective management strategies for lake ecosystems requires an understanding of regional differences interannual variability and other drivers affecting the availability of nutrients to algae in this study generalized additive models gams based on meteorological factors and geographic location were developed to quantitatively estimate the availability of nutrients to algae as represented by the ratio of chlorophyll a chl a to total phosphorus tp or total nitrogen tn across 167 chinese freshwater lakes and reservoirs this model was then used to produce the first spatial and temporal estimates of chl a tp and chl a tn within mainland china from 1987 to 2016 the results revealed high spatial variability driven primarily by geographic location which explained 58 86 of the observed variability in chl a tp 41 98 in chl a tn in addition high interannual variability was driven by annual average temperature for both chl a tp and chl a tn these results point to a fundamental challenge in managing regions with high nutrient levels because these regions also tend to exhibit the strongest interannual variability such that the impact of changes in management practices will be modulated by meteorological variability in addition this study provides regionalization indicators that serve as a quantitative foundation for formulating nutrient ecoregions to better administer lakes and reservoirs in china it is therefore imperative that models combining meteorological factors with geographic location are further developed to improve the simulation of spatio temporal variability in the availability of nutrients to algae keywords availability of nutrients to algae regional diversity interannual variability temperature geographic location 1 introduction china has numerous lakes with significant regional differences in the availability of nutrients to algae the establishment of a single national eutrophication control strategy for these lakes is not a realistic goal because of their highly variable climates geographic locations and ecosystems one way to approach this problem is the designation of ecoregions a mapped classification system of ecological regions with relatively homogeneous ecological characteristics omernik 1987 a primary reference indicator for formulating lake nutrient ecoregions is the availability of nutrients to algae the ratio of chlorophyll a chl a per mass unit of total phosphorus tp or total nitrogen tn which reflects nutrient and energy flow in lake ecosystems abell et al 2012 huo et al 2014 nutrient effects depend on overall algal growth conditions and environmental factors such as meteorology and geography previous research has indicated that meteorological conditions can alter the relationship between nutrients and primary productivity leading to variations in the availability of nutrients to algae davis et al 2009 sienkiewicz et al 2017 wood et al 2016 for example temperature and light intensity are the major factors determining the growth responses of algae and thus their relationship with nutrients halldal and french 1958 water temperature is highly correlated with primary productivity and significantly affects the relationships between lgtn lgtp and lgchl a liu et al 2018 wang et al 2016 temperature increases can significantly enhance chl a concentrations suggesting that lakes without algal blooms could develop a dominant population of cyanobacteria and experience blooms under warmer scenarios even without further increases in nutrient inputs havens and paerl 2015 liu et al 2018 light intensity is an important condition for phytoplankton growth and is related to the uptake of phosphorus and other micronutrients paerl et al 2011 in addition heavy rainfall has a dilution effect on lake water and carries nutrients into lakes huo et al 2014 leading to further variability in the availability of nutrients to algae furthermore geographic factors such as longitude latitude and altitude may affect the availability of nutrients to algae altitude is highly correlated with light intensity reguera et al 2014 which can serve as an alternative indicator for light intensity at the same level of nutrient concentration lakes at higher altitudes have more nutrient availability huo et al 2014 although anthropogenic impacts such as point and non point source pollution are the main determinants of lake eutrophication natural factors such as geographic location can influence lakes capacity to buffer nutrient inputs and play important roles in defining their eutrophication status liu et al 2010 hence meteorological and geographic factors should be considered as important influences on the availability of nutrients to algae although there are significant regional differences in china with regard to nutrient availability national survey data for lakes are scarce to address this knowledge gap this study 1 identified the primary natural factors that explain the observed variability in nutrient availability 2 developed generalized additive models gams for quantitatively estimating tn tp availability in 167 chinese lakes and reservoirs and 3 simulated the spatio temporal variability in tn tp availability across mainland china from 1987 to 2016 the results provide regionalized indicators and quantitative foundations for formulating lake nutrient ecoregions to better administer lakes and reservoirs in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area in this study 167 water bodies with continuous data records in mainland china were investigated to identify the impact of meteorological factors and geographic location on the availability of nutrients to algae of the 167 studied water bodies fig 1 5 39 are oligotrophic 63 47 are mesotrophic 23 95 are light eutrophic and 7 19 are mid eutrophic most of the studied lakes are shallow and have suffered from different degrees of eutrophication especially in the middle and lower regions of the yangtze river analysis of the tn tp ratios indicated that most were primarily phosphorus limited such that algal growth was more sensitive to changes in phosphorus than nitrogen schindler et al 2008 wu et al 2017 the majority of lakes in the qingzang plateau region are oligotrophic with lower primary productivities making it difficult to assess the availability of nutrients to algae huo et al 2014 so lakes in this region were excluded from the current study 2 2 data collection water quality data for the 167 lakes were obtained from environmental agencies and scientific institutes including the ambient monitoring network supported by the department of provincial environmental protection of china tn tp and chl a concentrations were sampled at several sites in each lake and reservoir during routine monthly monitoring from 1991 to 2016 these concentrations were analyzed in a laboratory using the standard testing procedures recommended by the ministry of environmental protection of china prc mep 2002 to maintain data validity observations below the detection limit were replaced with one half the detection limit for the given variable so the processed data were sufficiently accurate to determine descriptive statistics huo et al 2013 us epa 2006 the annual averages of the variables in each lake or reservoir were calculated as the model input dataset for each lake the longitude e and latitude n of the geographic midpoint were obtained from the china lake database http www lakesci csdb cn and imported into arcgis 10 2 esri california usa to extract elevations based on a digital elevation model at 1 1 km resolution meteorological data for the 1987 2016 study period were obtained from the observation dataset cn05 1 which was constructed by the anomaly approach during interpolation based on 2400 station observations in china wu and gao 2013 xu et al 2009 2 3 model development the biological response to nutrient gradients can be subtle and difficult to detect using linear regression analysis haggard et al 2013 huo et al 2015 moreover ecological responses to environmental gradients are often nonlinear non normal and heterogeneous huo et al 2015 hence gams were applied to develop a nonlinear model for log transformed annual chl a tn and chl a tp lg chl a tn and lg chl a tp by using variables related to geographic location temperature and precipitation calibrated using observations from the 167 lakes and reservoirs 1 g μ μ s 1 x 1 s p x p t e 1 x p 1 x p m t e q x n t x n ε where g μ is a link function of the response variable μ expresses the average value of the response variable s1 sp are smooth functions of the explanatory variables te1 teq are tensor product smooth functions x1 xp xn are the explanatory variables and ε is the residual in this study te longitude latitude altitude is the tensor product of smooth function for longitude latitude and altitude the bayesian information criterion bic a statistical model selection approach was used to select the predictor variables for inclusion in the gams based on their ability to explain the variability in observed lg chl a tn or lg chl a tp the bic measures model fit using the residual sum of squares rss and model complexity is penalized based on the number of predictor variables in a model bic is defined as 2 bic 2 ln y y t y y m k ln m where ŷ m 1 represents predicted lg chl a tn or lg chl a tp based on a particular subset of predictor variables and k represents the number of auxiliary variables including the intercept in the gams relative to other criterion based model selection approaches e g the akaike information criterion the bic has a larger penalty term and therefore tends to select a smaller set of predictor variables all possible subsets of candidate predictor variables were considered and the subset with the lowest bic was identified as the best model in the sense that it provided the optimal balance between explanatory power and complexity sinha and michalak 2016 the candidate predictor variables based on geographic location temperature and precipitation are described below and listed in table 1 ten candidate predictor variables related to temperature and precipitation were defined as meteorological factors annual average temperature tm growing season length gsl simple precipitation intensity index sdii and 7 variables indicative of extreme temperature and extreme precipitation the latter variables focused on the months of june july and august because observed precipitation was highest in those three months the bic results indicated that tm c and geographic location longitude latitude and altitudes were the main variables influencing the availability of nutrients to algae 3 results and discussion 3 1 the contributions of temperature and geographic location to chl a tp and chl a tn the gams were applied to investigate the impacts of temperature and geographic location on chl a tn and chl a tp which separately served as the response variables significant correlations p 0 001 were found between the response variables and explanatory variables in the two gams which explained 44 and 36 of the variance in lg chl a tp and lg chl a tn respectively for chl a tp the contribution of geographic location was much higher than that of temperature while for chl a tn the contributions of temperature and geographic location were similar table 2 the contributions of temperature to lg chl a tp and lg chl a tn were 37 18 and 42 46 respectively as shown in fig 2 the effects of temperature s spatial distribution on lg chl a tp were not consistent with those on lg chl a tn this may be because the metabolic pathway for nitrogen and phosphorus varies by organism nitrogen is a fundamental element for the formation of proteins and nucleic acids while being an integral part of essential molecules such as atp the energy carrier in cells phosphate is another very important nutrient phosphate is also a part of the backbone of dna and rna and is a key component of phospholipids juneja et al 2013 the positive influences of temperature on lg chl a tp and lg chl a tn were concentrated in the yungui plateau and southeast hill regions while those for lg chl a tn also occurred in the northeast mountain and xinjiang mountain regions this indicated that rising temperature would significantly improve the availability of nutrients to algae in these regions the other regions had negative impacts perhaps because other meteorological factors had significant effects on nutrient availability the influence of temperature on algal growth is well known previous research has shown that at a given nutrient concentration rising temperatures are expected to increase nutrient availability to cyanobacteria davis et al 2009 paerl and huisman 2009 wang et al 2016 water temperature is highly correlated with primary productivity and influences cyanobacterial development wang et al 2016 higher temperatures increase the growth of microcystis whose optimal temperature for growth and photosynthesis is at or above 25 c davis et al 2009 therefore rising temperatures could offer a distinct growth advantage to microcystis over eukaryotic primary producers under eutrophic conditions in addition higher temperatures can decrease the viscosity of surface water increasing the sedimentation rate of eukaryotic phytoplankton and further strengthening the competitive advantage of microcystis because cyanobacteria can regulate their buoyancy to optimize nutrient and light acquisition paerl and huisman 2009 geographic location alone explained a greater proportion of the observed variability in lg chl a tp 58 86 than in lg chl a tn 41 98 across the studied lakes this result is consistent with nõges 2009 who showed that latitude and altitude can significantly affect the water quality and phytoplankton production of lakes as shown in fig 2 the spatial effects of geographic location on lg chl a tp were nearly consistent with those on lg chl a tn the positive influences of geographic location on lg chl a tp and lg chl a tn were mainly concentrated in the yungui plateau region while the negative impacts were concentrated in the southeast hill region and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river the impacts of geographic location on lg chl a tp and lg chl a tn were highest in lower latitude regions with higher altitude more modest in regions with higher latitude and altitude and smallest in regions with higher latitude but lower altitude this demonstrated that the influences of geographic location on nutrient availability increased with altitude in agreement with the findings of cao et al 2011 that lake altitude had the greatest influence on nutrient effects in china as altitude increases the greater light intensity is conducive to algal growth of algae through its impact on photosynthesis so the photo adaptation photo acclimation process in algae leads to changes in cell properties via the availability of light and an increase in photosynthetic efficiency juneja et al 2013 stockenreiter et al 2013 therefore in lower latitude regions with higher altitude sufficient sunlight and suitable temperatures are helpful for algal growth and the improvement of nutrient effects 3 2 spatial and interannual variability of chl a tn and chl a tp there were significant spatial differences in the availability of tn or tp to algae figs 3 and 4 the yungui plateau had more twice the average chl a tp and chl a tn than these of northeast mountain regions relative to the entire study area figs 3a and 4a and experienced extremely large nutrient effects overall areas with the largest temporally average chl a tp and chl a tn were those with higher altitudes such as the yungui plateau and northeast mountain regions consistent with the contribution of temperature and geographic location to chl a tp and chl a tn the yungui plateau southeast hill north plain and middle lower yangtze river regions are located at similar latitudes but showed significant differences in chl a tp and chl a tn the yungui plateau s higher altitude meant that stronger sunlight and suitable temperature were conducive to algal growth in the yangtze river plain intensive anthropogenic activity and sediments in shallow lakes that are vulnerable to resuspension from external causes meant that high concentrations of suspended particulate matter restricted the availability of nutrients to algae chung et al 2009 huang and liu 2009 huo et al 2014 the southeast hill and north plain regions had larger chl a tp ratios than the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river plain due to more light availability and lower suspended solid concentrations interannual variabilities associated with the availability of nutrients to algae were also quantified within mainland china overall finding that the year to year variability in chl a tp and chl a tn was highest for areas figs 3b and 4b with the highest chl a tp and chl a tn figs 3a and 4a in fact regions with higher standard deviations for interannual variability in chl a tp and chl a tn were sensitive to temperature such as the yungui plateau and northeast mountain regions liu et al 2018 the heating rates of these regions were higher than elsewhere in china leading to higher interannual variability in chl a tp and chl a tn and indicating that temperature could be expected to influence interannual variability in chl a tp and chl a tn overall for the vast majority of mainland china spatial variability in chl a tp and chl a tn was primarily driven by geographic location while interannual variability and the occurrence of extremes were instead driven by temperature variability this contrast was especially evident in high nutrient effect areas within the yungui plateau and northeast mountain regions where geographic location was the strongest predictor of spatial nutrient effects but temperature drove both interannual variability and extremes figs 3 and 4 3 3 uncertainty analysis the gams used in this study could not quantify all influence factors due to insufficient data availability in the absence of human activities environmental factors other than temperature and geography e g lake morphology wind patterns water color and suspended sediment can impact nutrient availability huo et al 2014 liu et al 2010 for example lake morphology parameters such as mean depth and volume reflect buffering capacity against nutrient inputs and thus affect water quality wang et al 2016 lower wind speed and longer low wind duration can enhance the release of phosphorus from sediments and increase nitrogen losses lower wind speeds can also increase phytoplankton biomass as chl a by altering nutrient effects deng et al 2018 both water color and suspended sediments the latter often coincide with increased n and p concentrations can affect the light available for photosynthesis us epa 2010 therefore these factors should be taken into account when developing future models adaptive strategies for land use intended to reduce harmful consequences may conflict with regulations aimed at preserving or enhancing environmental quality fezzi et al 2015 as agriculture has a major impact on freshwater quality changes in farmland use have the potential to substantially alter aquatic ecosystems sterling et al 2012 human modifications of natural landscapes associated with soil degradation changes in water flow and quality and other impacts may alter ecosystem functions decrease biodiversity and influence the availability of nutrients to algae kissinger and rees 2010 on the other hand nutrient reduction strategies aimed at alleviating eutrophication may change this pattern in a different manner for example tp and tn concentrations in lake taihu the third largest freshwater lake in china decreased by 42 5 and 31 2 from 2007 to 2015 respectively but the frequency and intensity of cyanobacterial blooms did not significantly decrease due to warmer temperatures yang et al 2016 hence the effect of regulation on strategies for land management and eutrophication mitigation should be taken into consideration in further research 3 4 implications for management of lakes and reservoirs china is a vast territory characterized by significant regional variations in the availability of nutrients to algae which strongly influence the proper delineation of lake nutrient ecoregions huo et al 2014 as this process is based on the hypothesis that lake ecosystems display regional patterns that are reflected in spatially variable combinations of causal factors our results demonstrate that spatial variations in temperature and geographic location that cause or reflect differences in nutrient effects within lakes must be considered when establishing nutrient ecoregions in order to better serve the needs of scientific research and policy making due to differences in the availability of nutrients to algae at the same nutrient level higher primary production would exist in regions with greater nutrient effects leading to the deterioration of water quality liu et al 2018 hence eutrophication management strategies should be determined by the ecoregion level and stricter nutrient thresholds should be developed to achieve the desired water quality without the threat of eutrophication for the ecoregion with higher nutrient effects this study provides regionalized indicators and quantitative foundation for formulating lake nutrient ecoregions to better administer lakes and reservoirs in china the results also pointed to a fundamental challenge in managing regions with high nutrient effects because these regions also exhibited the strongest interannual variability such that the impact of changes in management practices would be modulated by meteorological variability these results have implications for management strategies aimed at reducing the occurrence of eutrophication in different regions which are themselves linked to interannual variability in nutrient effects first the observed year to year variabilities in nutrient effect were dominated by meteorological conditions and changes in temperature may take a long time to noticeably influence nutrient effects second the findings of this study also highlight the fact that strategies aimed at alleviating water quality impacts must be based on an assessment of the compounding roles of geographic location and meteorological conditions on nutrient effects rather than being informed by analyses relying on long term water quality third long term management strategies must acknowledge and account for the fact that meteorological conditions are themselves evolving as time persist which will affect the availability of nutrients to algae regional differences and interannual variability in temperature and geographic location must therefore be carefully considered within the context of evolving management strategies 4 conclusions quantitatively analyzing the impacts of meteorologic and geographic factors on the availability of nutrients to algae in lakes reservoirs is of great significance to water resource management in this study the spatial and temporal impact of physiographical and climatological factors on the availability of nutrients to algae was estimated with gams using chl a tp or chl a tn as the response variable and longitude latitude altitudes and annual average temperature as the explanatory variables from 1987 to 2016 in mainland china the results provide the first spatially and temporally explicit estimates of the availability of nutrients to algae throughout most of mainland china excluding the qingzang plateau region revealing considerable spatial and temporal variability in annual chl a tp and chl a tn regions with high relative interannual variability coincided with regions having high nutrient effects geographic location was the primary driver of spatial variability in chl a tp and chl a tn while annual average temperature drove interannual variability these results point to a fundamental challenge in managing regions with high nutrient effects because these regions also exhibited the strongest interannual variability and the impact of changes in management practices would be modulated by meteorological variability these results provide regionalized indicators and quantitative foundations for formulating lake nutrient ecoregions to better manage lakes and reservoirs in china

indicated that tm c and geographic location longitude latitude and altitudes were the main variables influencing the availability of nutrients to algae 3 results and discussion 3 1 the contributions of temperature and geographic location to chl a tp and chl a tn the gams were applied to investigate the impacts of temperature and geographic location on chl a tn and chl a tp which separately served as the response variables significant correlations p 0 001 were found between the response variables and explanatory variables in the two gams which explained 44 and 36 of the variance in lg chl a tp and lg chl a tn respectively for chl a tp the contribution of geographic location was much higher than that of temperature while for chl a tn the contributions of temperature and geographic location were similar table 2 the contributions of temperature to lg chl a tp and lg chl a tn were 37 18 and 42 46 respectively as shown in fig 2 the effects of temperature s spatial distribution on lg chl a tp were not consistent with those on lg chl a tn this may be because the metabolic pathway for nitrogen and phosphorus varies by organism nitrogen is a fundamental element for the formation of proteins and nucleic acids while being an integral part of essential molecules such as atp the energy carrier in cells phosphate is another very important nutrient phosphate is also a part of the backbone of dna and rna and is a key component of phospholipids juneja et al 2013 the positive influences of temperature on lg chl a tp and lg chl a tn were concentrated in the yungui plateau and southeast hill regions while those for lg chl a tn also occurred in the northeast mountain and xinjiang mountain regions this indicated that rising temperature would significantly improve the availability of nutrients to algae in these regions the other regions had negative impacts perhaps because other meteorological factors had significant effects on nutrient availability the influence of temperature on algal growth is well known previous research has shown that at a given nutrient concentration rising temperatures are expected to increase nutrient availability to cyanobacteria davis et al 2009 paerl and huisman 2009 wang et al 2016 water temperature is highly correlated with primary productivity and influences cyanobacterial development wang et al 2016 higher temperatures increase the growth of microcystis whose optimal temperature for growth and photosynthesis is at or above 25 c davis et al 2009 therefore rising temperatures could offer a distinct growth advantage to microcystis over eukaryotic primary producers under eutrophic conditions in addition higher temperatures can decrease the viscosity of surface water increasing the sedimentation rate of eukaryotic phytoplankton and further strengthening the competitive advantage of microcystis because cyanobacteria can regulate their buoyancy to optimize nutrient and light acquisition paerl and huisman 2009 geographic location alone explained a greater proportion of the observed variability in lg chl a tp 58 86 than in lg chl a tn 41 98 across the studied lakes this result is consistent with nõges 2009 who showed that latitude and altitude can significantly affect the water quality and phytoplankton production of lakes as shown in fig 2 the spatial effects of geographic location on lg chl a tp were nearly consistent with those on lg chl a tn the positive influences of geographic location on lg chl a tp and lg chl a tn were mainly concentrated in the yungui plateau region while the negative impacts were concentrated in the southeast hill region and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river the impacts of geographic location on lg chl a tp and lg chl a tn were highest in lower latitude regions with higher altitude more modest in regions with higher latitude and altitude and smallest in regions with higher latitude but lower altitude this demonstrated that the influences of geographic location on nutrient availability increased with altitude in agreement with the findings of cao et al 2011 that lake altitude had the greatest influence on nutrient effects in china as altitude increases the greater light intensity is conducive to algal growth of algae through its impact on photosynthesis so the photo adaptation photo acclimation process in algae leads to changes in cell properties via the availability of light and an increase in photosynthetic efficiency juneja et al 2013 stockenreiter et al 2013 therefore in lower latitude regions with higher altitude sufficient sunlight and suitable temperatures are helpful for algal growth and the improvement of nutrient effects 3 2 spatial and interannual variability of chl a tn and chl a tp there were significant spatial differences in the availability of tn or tp to algae figs 3 and 4 the yungui plateau had more twice the average chl a tp and chl a tn than these of northeast mountain regions relative to the entire study area figs 3a and 4a and experienced extremely large nutrient effects overall areas with the largest temporally average chl a tp and chl a tn were those with higher altitudes such as the yungui plateau and northeast mountain regions consistent with the contribution of temperature and geographic location to chl a tp and chl a tn the yungui plateau southeast hill north plain and middle lower yangtze river regions are located at similar latitudes but showed significant differences in chl a tp and chl a tn the yungui plateau s higher altitude meant that stronger sunlight and suitable temperature were conducive to algal growth in the yangtze river plain intensive anthropogenic activity and sediments in shallow lakes that are vulnerable to resuspension from external causes meant that high concentrations of suspended particulate matter restricted the availability of nutrients to algae chung et al 2009 huang and liu 2009 huo et al 2014 the southeast hill and north plain regions had larger chl a tp ratios than the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river plain due to more light availability and lower suspended solid concentrations interannual variabilities associated with the availability of nutrients to algae were also quantified within mainland china overall finding that the year to year variability in chl a tp and chl a tn was highest for areas figs 3b and 4b with the highest chl a tp and chl a tn figs 3a and 4a in fact regions with higher standard deviations for interannual variability in chl a tp and chl a tn were sensitive to temperature such as the yungui plateau and northeast mountain regions liu et al 2018 the heating rates of these regions were higher than elsewhere in china leading to higher interannual variability in chl a tp and chl a tn and indicating that temperature could be expected to influence interannual variability in chl a tp and chl a tn overall for the vast majority of mainland china spatial variability in chl a tp and chl a tn was primarily driven by geographic location while interannual variability and the occurrence of extremes were instead driven by temperature variability this contrast was especially evident in high nutrient effect areas within the yungui plateau and northeast mountain regions where geographic location was the strongest predictor of spatial nutrient effects but temperature drove both interannual variability and extremes figs 3 and 4 3 3 uncertainty analysis the gams used in this study could not quantify all influence factors due to insufficient data availability in the absence of human activities environmental factors other than temperature and geography e g lake morphology wind patterns water color and suspended sediment can impact nutrient availability huo et al 2014 liu et al 2010 for example lake morphology parameters such as mean depth and volume reflect buffering capacity against nutrient inputs and thus affect water quality wang et al 2016 lower wind speed and longer low wind duration can enhance the release of phosphorus from sediments and increase nitrogen losses lower wind speeds can also increase phytoplankton biomass as chl a by altering nutrient effects deng et al 2018 both water color and suspended sediments the latter often coincide with increased n and p concentrations can affect the light available for photosynthesis us epa 2010 therefore these factors should be taken into account when developing future models adaptive strategies for land use intended to reduce harmful consequences may conflict with regulations aimed at preserving or enhancing environmental quality fezzi et al 2015 as agriculture has a major impact on freshwater quality changes in farmland use have the potential to substantially alter aquatic ecosystems sterling et al 2012 human modifications of natural landscapes associated with soil degradation changes in water flow and quality and other impacts may alter ecosystem functions decrease biodiversity and influence the availability of nutrients to algae kissinger and rees 2010 on the other hand nutrient reduction strategies aimed at alleviating eutrophication may change this pattern in a different manner for example tp and tn concentrations in lake taihu the third largest freshwater lake in china decreased by 42 5 and 31 2 from 2007 to 2015 respectively but the frequency and intensity of cyanobacterial blooms did not significantly decrease due to warmer temperatures yang et al 2016 hence the effect of regulation on strategies for land management and eutrophication mitigation should be taken into consideration in further research 3 4 implications for management of lakes and reservoirs china is a vast territory characterized by significant regional variations in the availability of nutrients to algae which strongly influence the proper delineation of lake nutrient ecoregions huo et al 2014 as this process is based on the hypothesis that lake ecosystems display regional patterns that are reflected in spatially variable combinations of causal factors our results demonstrate that spatial variations in temperature and geographic location that cause or reflect differences in nutrient effects within lakes must be considered when establishing nutrient ecoregions in order to better serve the needs of scientific research and policy making due to differences in the availability of nutrients to algae at the same nutrient level higher primary production would exist in regions with greater nutrient effects leading to the deterioration of water quality liu et al 2018 hence eutrophication management strategies should be determined by the ecoregion level and stricter nutrient thresholds should be developed to achieve the desired water quality without the threat of eutrophication for the ecoregion with higher nutrient effects this study provides regionalized indicators and quantitative foundation for formulating lake nutrient ecoregions to better administer lakes and reservoirs in china the results also pointed to a fundamental challenge in managing regions with high nutrient effects because these regions also exhibited the strongest interannual variability such that the impact of changes in management practices would be modulated by meteorological variability these results have implications for management strategies aimed at reducing the occurrence of eutrophication in different regions which are themselves linked to interannual variability in nutrient effects first the observed year to year variabilities in nutrient effect were dominated by meteorological conditions and changes in temperature may take a long time to noticeably influence nutrient effects second the findings of this study also highlight the fact that strategies aimed at alleviating water quality impacts must be based on an assessment of the compounding roles of geographic location and meteorological conditions on nutrient effects rather than being informed by analyses relying on long term water quality third long term management strategies must acknowledge and account for the fact that meteorological conditions are themselves evolving as time persist which will affect the availability of nutrients to algae regional differences and interannual variability in temperature and geographic location must therefore be carefully considered within the context of evolving management strategies 4 conclusions quantitatively analyzing the impacts of meteorologic and geographic factors on the availability of nutrients to algae in lakes reservoirs is of great significance to water resource management in this study the spatial and temporal impact of physiographical and climatological factors on the availability of nutrients to algae was estimated with gams using chl a tp or chl a tn as the response variable and longitude latitude altitudes and annual average temperature as the explanatory variables from 1987 to 2016 in mainland china the results provide the first spatially and temporally explicit estimates of the availability of nutrients to algae throughout most of mainland china excluding the qingzang plateau region revealing considerable spatial and temporal variability in annual chl a tp and chl a tn regions with high relative interannual variability coincided with regions having high nutrient effects geographic location was the primary driver of spatial variability in chl a tp and chl a tn while annual average temperature drove interannual variability these results point to a fundamental challenge in managing regions with high nutrient effects because these regions also exhibited the strongest interannual variability and the impact of changes in management practices would be modulated by meteorological variability these results provide regionalized indicators and quantitative foundations for formulating lake nutrient ecoregions to better manage lakes and reservoirs in china

6598,in recent years continuous improvements have been made in weather forecasting and flood prediction with great benefit from early warning systems ewss despite the continuous quest for innovation from the scientific and user communities ewss remain based mostly on hazard forecast and the information on possible consequences and potential impacts is generally missing in this work a methodology for quantitative real time impact assessment for flash floods is presented the methodology uses a multi model ensemble approach and considers soil moisture uncertainty moreover the flood forecasting chain which normally provides only the discharge probability of exceeding a given threshold is extended to include a fully 2d hydraulic model and a damage estimation model to quantitatively assess impacts in terms of economic losses and the people involved the procedure was tested on recent flood events occurring in genoa in northwestern italy this paper discusses the potential challenges and opportunities offered by this approach in the decision making workflow in an operational context keywords flood forecast probabilistic damage impacts hydrometeorology 1 introduction despite continuous improvements in weather forecasting and flood prediction floods still cause multiple casualties and significant damage to properties and infrastructures every year with adverse economic consequences for communities that can persist for many years this trend may worsen in the future if we consider the effects of climate change and urbanization according to a recent study of the european environment agency eea 2016 annual flood losses can be expected to increase fivefold by 2050 and up to 17 fold by 2080 rarely hydro meteorological forecasts are connected to quantitative potential impact estimates economic losses and people involved since hydro meteorological forecasts are generally devoted to prediction of possible flood magnitudes silvestro et al 2011 gourley et al 2014 2017 naulin et al 2013 versini et al 2014 as a consequence decisions from the authorities responsible for civil protection emergency management are based on the experience accumulated by the forecasters using their technological systems while actions to safeguard population and assets are often determined by their subjective perception of the local risk conditions while there is a realization of what the weather might be there is frequently a lack of understanding of what the weather might do wmo 2015 to improve early warning systems ewss a paradigm to shift from hazard to impact forecasts is needed recent studies proposed methodologies for rapid impact assessment and estimation of damage severity schroeder et al 2016 cole et al 2016 sai et al 2018 or direct estimation of the number of impacted buildings le bihan et al 2016 le bihan et al 2017 the economic dimension when addressed is often computed at a coarse resolution dottori et al 2017 incompatible with flash flood impact assessment needs the present approach goes one step further by computing direct economic damage and impact on the population at a building scale which will ultimately result in better contingency planning reasonable worst case and most likely outcomes the decision making process will be facilitated and put under a cost benefit perspective e g economic losses of the predicted event may be quantitatively compared to the cost of mitigation measures this approach would also improve the objective evaluation of responsibilities of forecasters and decision makers in the ews context additionally impact forecasts can contribute to a common situational awareness and a better acceptance of mitigation countermeasures by the general public the enhancement process of an early warning system relies on one hand on improving the quality of hazard forecasts by quantifying major sources of uncertainty and on the other hand on extending the modelling chain to quantitatively assess potential losses these two principles have been applied to improve the flash flood early warning system for the city of genoa which recently suffered the consequences of two devastating flash floods in 2011 and 2014 fiori et al 2014 2017 silvestro et al 2012 many modelling experiments based on forecasting chains davolio et al 2015 hally et al 2015 davolio et al 2017 have been conducted in recent years to evaluate the amount of hydrometeorological uncertainty in the prediction of the flash floods that hit the ligurian region on the northwest side of italy hereafter the liguria region one of the most recent studies parodi et al 2017 was supported by the use of a prototype distributed computing infrastructure dci developed under the eu funded projects drihm distributed research infrastructure for hydro meteorology www drihm eu and drihm2us distributed research infrastructure for hydro meteorology to us www drihm2 µs eu for studying high impact weather events hiwes with a special focus on floods and flash flood events based on the experience mentioned above this work addresses three main topics the first topic is the evaluation of possible added value of high resolution numerical weather prediction systems nwpss as input for streamflow forecasts on a study area characterized by a small basin struck by flash flood events davolio et al 2015 fiori et al 2017 the second is understanding how the uncertainties in the initial soil moisture conditions of the hydrological model can affect the forecast performance silvestro and rebora 2014 the third is extending the typical flood forecasting chain rainfall discharge water levels to quantitatively include exposure and vulnerability factors and understanding how the first two topics interact and affect the forecast in terms of impacts the analysis of flood events based on stream flow only predicts the probability of overtopping but does not provide quantitative information on the affected population and properties molinari and handmer 2011 sättele 2016 the formulation of impact scenarios is necessary to better understand the consequences of a forecast event and then to apply mitigation measures in real time as foreseen in emergency plans hazard predictions expressed as probabilistic maps of flood water depth and velocity are thus translated into impact predictions such as the probability of exceeding a given economic loss or the probability that a certain number of people can be affected by the flood 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and case studies bisagno is a basin located in northwestern italy in the liguria region the drainage area is small approximately 98 km2 and the elevations of the catchment range between 0 and 1100 m above sea level so the environment changes from mountainous to coastal with high slopes fig 1 in few kilometres the mean catchment elevation is approximately 370 m bisagno is mainly covered by forests and brushes but with a high level of urbanization along the last 10 km of the riverbed which is characterized by a high concentration of inhabited areas industries and other infrastructure highly prone to the risk of flooding because the city developed along the bisagno river bed from the outlet to the inland during the last century furthermore along the last 1 5 km the river flows underneath a heavily urbanized area and the maximum discharge under the conditions of free surface flow is approximately 700 m3 s which corresponds to a return period t 30 y streamflow values larger than the latter threshold cause a sudden reduction of the maximum discharge carried under the cover and the flow overbanking liguria is monitored through a meteo hydrological network named omirl osservatorio meteo idrologico della regione liguria as described in silvestro et al 2015a this network is the official network of the liguria region which contributes to the italian micro meteorological network operationally used by the italian civil protection department molini et al 2009 the stations furnish measurements with a time step of 5 10 min there are approximately 200 rain gauges over the region with an average density of 1 rain gauge 40 km2 the network also has stations with other sensors temperature radiation wind air humidity etc but in these cases the densities are lower than the rain gauge density the instruments are professional tipping bucket gauges with 0 2 mm accuracy maximum error with an intensity of 300 mm h of approximately 2 and they satisfy all the wmo recommendations and are regularly maintained by the regional technicians the bisagno basin is particularly well instrumented the rain gauge network density is approximately 1 rain gauge 10 km2 a water level station named passerella firpo is located near the beginning of the cover and has an upstream area of approximately 93 km2 level data can be used together with an available stage discharge curve to estimate observed streamflow three extreme rainfall events are considered for the presented analysis based on the following reasons 1 two events caused inundation with severe damages while the third event caused a streamflow that was very close to the flooding level table 1 2 these events exhibited the typical thermodynamic and kinematic features related to the occurrence of v shaped back building mesoscale convective systems in the liguria sea area rebora et al 2013 silvestro et al 2015 fiori et al 2014 2017 lagasio et al 2017 3 the results of the operational forecasting chain applied to these case studies are available to verify the quality of the new approach 2 2 impact flood forecast modelling chain the impact forecast modelling chain hereinafter proposed to extend the typical flood forecasting chain hally et al 2015 that furnishes results in terms of streamflow by adding one module for hazard spatialization flooded areas expressed in terms of water depth and velocity and one for damage computation as shown in fig 2 the final modelling chain is formed by several modelling blocks meteorological multi models at global and limited area scale a stochastic downscaling model a fully distributed hydrological model a fully 2d hydraulic model and a damage model 2 2 1 nwps benchmark and high resolution models the numerical weather prediction system nwps used in the study consists of three different non hydrostatic models harmonie arome model moloch and wrf awr model the hirlam aladin research on mesoscale operational nwp in euromed harmonie model is a convection permitting model developed by météo france and aladin this model is generally nested in the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf global model and it uses the same non hydrostatic nh dynamic core as arome france bengtsson et al 2017 describe the model setup and its similarities differences with respect to the arome france model with respect to the shortwave sw radiation parameterization the morcrette radiation scheme with an improved cloud liquid optical property scheme nielsen et al 2014 is implemented the microphysics scheme used is a one moment bulk scheme which uses a three class ice parameterization ice3 while a new turbulence scheme harmonie with racmo turbulence haratu is available no parameterization is employed for deep convection while a so called eddy diffusivity mass flux edmf parameterization is used for shallow convection the cycle 40 h1 1 of the harmonie arome is used for this study with 2 5 km grid spacing and 65 vertical model levels extending up to 10 hpa moloch is a fully compressible convection permitting model morrison and pinto 2006 davolio et al 2015 developed at the institute of atmospheric sciences and climate of the italian national research council cnr isac and is operationally combined with the bolam model from which it receives hourly lateral boundary information www isac cnr it dinamica projects forecasts the model settings for radiation turbulence and microphysics schemes used here are those of davolio et al 2015 the moloch operational configuration until the year 2017 has a grid spacing of 2 3 km and 50 vertical levels it is operational at the functional centre for meteo hydrological of the liguria region which is the institution in charge of making flood forecasting on the study area for this reason it is considered as the main benchmark in this study this choice was done to make a comparison between what the forecaster had as information before the event and what the forecaster would have had if the system analysed in this work had been available the advanced research weather research and forecasting wrf version 3 7 model is a fully compressible regional atmospheric model with terrain following the hydrostatic pressure vertical coordinate the wrf setup implemented here starts from the modelling results in lagasio et al 2017 two nested domains with respectively 5 km and 1 km grid spacings are used with the total numbers of vertical levels of 50 over the 20 km atmosphere depth explicit treatment of convection is adopted while four different types of microphysics are used for each case the wrf single moment six class scheme wsm6 hong and lim 2006 thompson thompson et al 2008 wrf double moment 6 class scheme lim et al 2010 hereafter wdm16 and morrison s double moment six class scheme morrison and pinto 2005 2006 all the analyses presented hereafter refer to the innermost domain at 1 km grid spacing the global operational ecmwf ifs nwp model simmons et al 1989 with 0 125 of grid spacing valid at 0000 utc of the same day of each event is used to initialize the three meteorological models 2 2 2 from meteorological to hydrological forecast rainfall downscaling and hydrological models the hydrological modelling suite adopted in this study is described in detail in silvestro et al 2015a and silvestro et al 2016 and it consists of a rainfall downscaling model rainfarm rebora et al 2006a 2006b and a hydrological model continuum silvestro et al 2013 rainfarm is a rainfall downscaling algorithm that produces an ensemble of rainfall scenarios that maintain some characteristics of the rainfall prediction derived by an nwps laiolo et al 2014 and can mimic the small scale variability of precipitation needed to correctly force the hydrological model the volume of precipitation predicted by the nwps is preserved by rainfarm together with the spatial and temporal structure at space and time scales that are considered reliable sr tr following the approach described in siccardi et al 2005 but each precipitation scenario reproduces a small spatial temporal variability that is present in a real rainfall field and that can be observed for example with meteorological radar as shown in rebora et al 2006b the spatial temporal fourier spectrum of the rainfall field follows the functional form 1 g k x k y ω 2 k x 2 k y 2 α 2 ω β kx and ky are the spatial wavenumbers of the and y directions ω the temporal wavenumber frequency and α and β represent two parameters of the model that are estimated from the power spectrum of rainfall forecast through the nwps in this application the reliable spatial and time scales sr tr are assumed 10 δx km where δx is the horizontal resolution of the nwps considered and 6 h based on the experience of rebora et al 2006b brussolo et al 2008 and davolio et al 2015 and considering that a meteorological model due to numerical diffusion is generally not reliable at scales smaller than six to four times its resolution patterson and orszag 1971 therefore rainfarm is constrained to keep the spatial and temporal patterns at these latter scales the final downscaled rainfall fields have a spatial resolution of 1 km and a time resolution of 60 min the rainfall scenarios built with rainfarm are used to feed continuum which is a distributed hydrological model based on a geomorphologic approach giannoni et al 2005 continuum combines semi empirical and physically based modules and it can work in a continuous way all the main physical processes that describe the hydrological cycle are modelled i e surface and sub surface flow deep flow infiltration evapotranspiration vegetation interception snow melting and accumulation a detailed description of the model can be found in silvestro et al 2013 2015b a digital elevation model dem is used to represent the catchment morphology and the flow directions are estimated calculating the directions of maximum slope each cell of the model drainage network is classified as hillslope or channel using a morphologic filter defined by the expression 2 a s k c where a is the contributing area upstream of each cell l2 s is the local slope k and c are quantities that describe the geomorphology of the basin giannoni et al 2000 and they are generally constant infiltration process and subsurface flow gabellani et al 2008 are modelled using a scheme based on a layer of reservoirs that represents the root zone silvestro et al 2013 and include a modification of the horton algorithm bauer 1974 diskin and nazimov 1994 the energy balance is computed using the force restore equation approximation dickinson 1988 that allows us to estimate as explicit output variables the soil surface temperature and the evapotranspiration the surface flow on hillslope cells is modelled using a linear reservoir scheme while flow on channel cells exploits the kinematic wave approach wooding 1965 todini and ciarapica 2001 continuum requires calibration for six parameters generally carried out at the basin scale two for the surface flow uh and uc two for the sub surface flow ct and cf and two for deep flow and water table vwmax and rf processes table 2 reports a brief description of the parameters for the current application the same implementation of davolio et al 2017 is used the model was implemented with a spatial resolution of 0 005 deg approximately 480 m based on the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm dem and the use of a corine land cover http www sinanet isprambiente it it progetti corine land cover 1 the temporal resolution used in all the experiments is 60 min in davolio et al 2017 a parameter calibration that focussed on the flood reproduction was also employed in this application the hydrological simulations always start in the coincidence of the date of initialization of the nwps as shown in table 3 2 2 3 accounting for soil moisture initial condition uncertainty the considered hydrological model is distributed and continuous therefore it is possible to produce an initial moisture condition at the beginning of each event that is derived by the physical processes simulated inside the model infiltration gravity percolation evapotranspiration to accomplish this we carried out a run of the model starting from 01 01 2011 until 12 12 2015 fed by observations the approach mentioned above should allow the reproduction of a realistic soil moisture pattern or at least a soil moisture estimation compatible with the model structure when the model is well calibrated in any case it is well known zappa et al 2011 silvestro and rebora 2014 laiolo et al 2016 that sometimes the modelled soil moisture can be highly different from the real soil moisture depending on a number of factors e g i ability of the model to reproduce the physical phenomena in a particular simulation time window ii reliability of the parameterization in that particular simulation period and iii reliability in the forcing data used to drive the model some variables such as solar radiation or wind are often poorly sampled by the ground gauge network a wrong soil moisture initial condition can thus cause over or under estimation of the streamflow prediction the over or under estimation can be evaluated in a post event analysis but it is a priori unknown in the presented analysis the uncertainty related to the hydrological model parameters was neglected essentially for two reasons on one side we used a hydrological model calibrated to reproduce high flows with good performance in reproducing these latter davolio et al 2017 on the other side various studies mascaro et al 2010 zappa et al 2011 indicated that parameter uncertainty is generally of lower magnitude with respect to uncertainties related to the rainfall forecast and to the initial wetting conditions especially for small catchments with a flash flood regime to introduce the impact of soil moisture uncertainty we generated a set of k soil moisture initial conditions starting from the one modelled with the observed meteorological variables being continuum a continuous distributed model produces the modelled state variables for each time step of the run made with observations as input in the case of soil moisture it is a two dimensional field with the same spatial resolution as the model implementation in this case 0 005 deg the mean soil moisture at basin scale with a value between 0 and 1 can easily be estimated as the mean of the values in the single pixels here after mso once the mso is estimated to account for possible modelling errors the set of k soil moisture initial condition is generated with the following steps 1 the kth mean soil moisture initial condition msk is extracted from a uniform distribution in the range mso dms mso dms where dms is set to 0 4 this is an arbitrary value based on previous analysis and on the comparison with satellite estimation laiolo et al 2016 cenci et al 2016 and means that we assumed that the maximum variability of the model soil moisture around mso is 40 of the soil moisture maximum range 0 1 2 the ratio 3 dratiosm msk mso is estimated and used to re scale the soil moisture map allowing us to change the mean soil moisture at the basin scale preserving the soil moisture pattern in this way it is assumed that the spatial pattern is generally well reproduced by the model the k soil moisture initial conditions can be combined with the m forecast rainfall fields generated with rainfarm and used to trigger the continuum model to produce mxk streamflow scenarios the perturbations applied to the original soil moisture field affect the internal coherence of the state variables specifically those related to the energy balance but this has no important consequences on the results on the time horizon of the forecast 2 3 days the energy balance negligibly affects the mass balance during such small periods 2 2 4 hydraulic modelling damages and potential affected population scenarios the 2d hydraulic model used in this work is telemac 2d which belongs to the telemac mascaret http www opentelemac org suite of models to be used for hydraulic modelling applications telemac 2d is based on the solution of the saint venant equations on a grid of triangular elements using as numerical schemes the finite element or finite volume methods the ability to model both permanent and transient conditions allows a number of operational and research applications in this application the same setup shown in silvestro et al 2016 was used the hydraulic model was calibrated to model historical flooding accurately with a special focus on the one that occurred on 09 10 2014 for this event the large availability of field measurements allowed a good estimation of the magnitude of the flood in terms of both water level and extent the model demonstrated the ability to reproduce post event field measurements the results and further details of the calibration process are presented in detail in silvestro et al 2016 direct economic loss computation was done by using the rasor rapid analysis and spatialization of risk platform rudari and the rasor team 2015 koudogbo et al 2014 that allows scenario based impact analysis across different hazards with respect to floods the direct economic loss estimation method is based on stage damage curves which provide percentage expected loss based on flood depth flood damage curves are associated with buildings according to their flood relevant features such as occupancy building usage height number of floors above and below the ground and split level presence percentage losses are then multiplied by replacement costs to obtain the economic loss for each building this study uses the same damage model configuration described in silvestro et al 2016 to compute direct damage to building structure and content in that study damage model validation was possible thanks to the damage data gathered in the aftermath of the 09 10 2014 event over 3000 citizen claims served as a benchmark for the building scale damage assessment performed through the rasor platform the modelling chain produced the estimate of the total damage with a percentage error of approximately 5 damage to vehicles water and electric systems and transport infrastructure was not considered in the present study the rasor platform was also used recently to quantify monetary flood risk mitigation benefits for the city of florence arrighi et al 2018 potential impacts on population were assessed considering that safety of people can be compromised when exposed to flows that exceed their ability to remain standing and or traverse a waterway over the last four decades numerous laboratory based experimental study regimes abt et al 1989 karvonen et al 2000 jonkman and penning rowsell 2008 jonkman et al 2009 xia et al 2014 and conceptual models love 1987 lind et al 2004 milanesi et al 2015 arrighi et al 2017 have been developed to define the limits of stability within differing flows the most common criterion to classify hazard zones is based on different values of the product between the water level h and the water speed u in this work four hazard zones very high high moderate low flood hazard were classified considering the thresholds identified by cox et al 2010 which consider the instability of adults high hazard zone and children moderate hazard zone these zones are identified by values of the product h u 0 8 m2s 1 high hazard zone and 0 4 m2s 1 h u 0 8 m2s 1 moderate hazard zone combined with another condition independent from the flow velocity which accounts for the risk of drowning maximum admissible water depth of 1 2 m for adults and 0 5 m for children jonkman et al 2009 by analysing the loss of life caused by the flooding of new orleans after hurricane katrina classified a zone with high mortality probability breach zone when h u 5 m2s 1 based on this threshold an extreme hazard zone was added the resulting four flood hazard zones can be ranked as follows extreme hazard zone when h u 5 m2s 1 high hazard zone when h 1 2 m and 0 8 m2s 1 h u 5 m2s 1 or h 1 2 m and h u 5 m2s 1 moderate hazard zone when h 0 5 m and 0 4 m2s 1 h u 0 8 m2s 1 or 0 5 m h 1 2 m and h u 0 8 m2s 1 low hazard zone when h 0 5 m and 0 m2s 1 h u 0 4 m2s 1 2 3 real time forecast of damage and population affected the rigorous method to carry out the damage forecast should be to insert into the flood forecast chain the two ingredients shown in section 2 2 4 hydraulic modelling and damage estimation for each streamflow scenario or at least for all those scenarios that overcome a certain threshold the hazard map and the damage map should be evaluated using the available models however the extended simulation chain that includes damage models would imply an additional amount of computational time and resources which may delay in time the forecast availability the study area is characterized by the fact that the part of the riverbed where the flooding starts is well known the inlet of the covered channel at approximately 2 km inland from the sea outlet is the most important point where flooding and inundation often begin this condition is certainly specific but similar situations are not so unusual in an environment made by small catchments that pass through highly urbanized areas where such structures as bridges and culverts often cause hydraulic backwater effects in this context we propose an approximate approach that allows substantial saving of computational time providing reasonable damage estimation in a quick time also in a probabilistic perspective when multiple streamflow scenarios need to be investigated a set of n streamflow scenarios was built using synthetic rainfall events as input to the hydrological model hyetographs were built following the approach of boni et al 2007 they are studied to have a small increment of a discharge peak between the ith and the ith 1 scenario around the flooding threshold then the increment increases as the severity of the event increases fig 3 each streamflow scenario with defined peak flow and flooding volume was used as input for the hydraulic model and the damage model in this way a library of damage scenarios was built and the library relates each peak flow and flooding volume to a damage estimate this library of preconfigured scenarios is used together with the hydro meteorological chain to produce probabilistic damage forecast as follows fig 3 1 generation of m streamflow scenarios with the probabilistic flood forecast chain 2 estimation of peak flow qp and flooding volume vf for each ith scenario that overcomes the flooding threshold 3 comparison of qp and vf with those available in the set of n predefined streamflow scenarios generally we will have two comparable scenarios the first with a similar qp and the second vf 4 estimation of two damage scenarios related to qp and vf for each ith streamflow scenario that overcomes the flooding threshold applying this conservative principle the larger damage is considered 5 build the forecast probabilistic distribution curve of damage relative to the population affected the previous procedure is applied to identify the scenario except that the variable to be considered is the affected population instead of economic loss in other words step 5 will be replaced by the following 5bis build the forecast probabilistic distribution curve of affected population fig 3 3 results results are presented referring to the outlet section of passerella firpo where streamflow observations are available the comparison is carried out referring to the observed peaks the peaks generated with the hydrological model fed with observations and the peaks obtained by the forecast the timing of the peak of each ensemble member is not considered the aggregation scale of nwps qpf is 6 h which is larger than the order of magnitude of the study catchment response time approximately 2 3 h the time pattern of each downscaled ensemble member is generated by rainfarm section 3 1 1 focusses on the effects on the streamflow forecast derived by the usage of available high resolution nwps while in section 3 1 2 the effects derived by the perturbation of the initial soil moisture condition were introduced section 3 2 is instead dedicated to analyse the results of the forecast in terms of impacts damage and affected population 3 1 hydrological probabilistic forecast 3 1 1 assessment of high resolution nwps the three considered events 09 10 2014 04 11 2011 and 14 09 2015 are first re forecast using the available high resolution nwps hereafter hr nwps and comparing the results with those obtained using the operational implementation of the model moloch previous analysis showed that the number of scenarios in the downscaling process of approximately 100 is normally sufficient to investigate the variability of the rainfall field produced by the downscaling silvestro and rebora 2014 however 400 downscaled rainfall scenarios are used here this choice was made to make the results still comparable with what is presented in section 3 1 2 where two sources of uncertainty were considered nwps and soil moisture in that case a larger value of m was necessary to describe the variability of the final results adequately in terms of streamflow when for instance superimposing two sources of uncertainties that can lead to contrasting directions e g a very critical rainfall scenario with a dry soil moisture initial condition in this case soil moisture initial conditions are fixed for each event for all the scenarios they are generated by the run of the hydrological model using the rainfall observations as input the probabilistic hydro meteorological chain accounts for the uncertainties in the rainfall field through the downscaling model fig 4 helps in understanding how the downscaling algorithm works panels a and b show the original rainfall field forecast with wrf wsm6 and an example of the downscaled scenario for the event on 09 10 2014 panel c shows the average precipitation accumulated on a box with dimension 2 sr rainfall accumulation on tr is conserved and the value at times 6 12 18 24 h is the same for all scenarios and equal to the deterministic value black dotted line panel d shows the average precipitation accumulated on the bisagno catchment in this case the total volume of the nwps is not conserved but we have scenarios with larger or lower total accumulation panels in fig 5 show the results for the three events in terms of box plot representation on the left column each panel represents by box plots the probabilistic forecast conditioned to the specific nwp x axis in terms of peak flow m3 s the blue diamond in each box represents the peak flow obtained with the hydrological model fed with observations hereafter sp while the black circle is the observed peak flow hereafter op on the right column panels show the results of all the nwps together in a multi model ensemble logic where every single model is given the same weight so that each peak is considered equi probable analysing the results for the 09 10 2014 event the use of hr nwps leads in various cases to an improvement in the results with respect to the benchmark considered confirming the finding of davolio et al 2015 and parodi et al 2017 that highlighted the benefit provided by increasing the horizontal spatial resolution of nwps to predict these kinds of events looking at fig 5 the range of forecast peak flows increases from a maximum of approximately 700 750 m3 s provided by the benchmark to values larger than 800 m3 s and peaking up to 1000 m3 s for the configuration wrf wsm6 model which includes also sp wrf morrison produces a forecast slightly better than benchmark only harmonie and wrf wdm16 did not exhibit an improvement of the forecast sp and op are still out of the prediction range in most of the predicted scenarios but the improvement is evident additionally for the cases of 04 11 2011 and 14 09 2015 there is an improvement of the forecast for all wrf configurations where wdm16 now appears to be one of the best configurations while harmonie provides predictions similar to the benchmark the discharge forecast driven by harmonie seems not to benefit the sm variability probably because rainfall patterns and volumes are too different from those that actually occurred the deterministic forecast obtained by feeding the hydrological model directly with rainfall derived by nwps is generally poor confirming the findings of siccardi et al 2005 the localization of the forecast precipitation is known to get increasingly important when the basin size decreases the usage of high resolution nwps does not guarantee the correct localization of precipitation even if the total volume of rainfall is satisfactorily predicted when considered at a larger scale as a consequence the flood forecast at basin scale cannot be properly addressed without rainfall downscaling on the study area considered in all the study cases the box plots include the sp and ob only for a reduced number of scenarios so the expected exceedance probability is generally low this finding is reasonable and a direct consequence of what was presented by siccardi et al 2005 and silvestro et al 2011 mainly due to the following causes i even when nwpss make a good prediction of the precipitation volume in most cases they do not describe the correct spatial and time patterns and or the rainfall localization ii since bisagno is a small catchment the reliable aggregation spatial and time scales in the downscaling process 10 20 km and 6 h in this application are comparable or larger than its size 1000 5 km and typical response time 2 3 h consequently only a limited number of scenarios combine rainfall volumes in spatial and the time structures that result in critical parameters for the study catchment silvestro et al 2015a demonstrated that even using as input the observed rainfall field if the aggregation scale increases then the observed peak is predicted with a decreasing probability in the present application we downscale the nwps rainfall prediction so it is mandatory to use an aggregation spatial scale that is similar to or larger than the bisagno basin size because of theoretical motivations patterson and orszag 1971 siccardi et al 2005 as a final consideration we can thus state that the fact of having the observed and simulated peaks in the tail of the predicted peak distribution in most of the presented cases can apparently be considered a poor result but it must be read accounting for the aforementioned considerations additionally using a given and predefined hr nwps is evidently not sufficient to have a systematic benefit while the effective strategy for the three considered events seems to use different hr nwps or the same hr nwps with different physical parameterizations namely the use of a multi model approach a single model may work well in a subset of events but might have bad performance on other case studies wrf wdm16 works well on 04 11 2011 but not on 09 10 2014 the multi model approach allows exploring the epistemic uncertainties associated with small scale processes phenomena which have a great impact on very concentrated and intense rainfall events causing flash floods 3 1 2 assessment of high resolution nwps and soil moisture uncertainties as mentioned in the previous section the differences between sp and op can be caused by a number of error sources where initial soil moisture conditions can often drive large errors in streamflow simulations in this section the results of the hydro meteorological chain accounting for soil moisture initial condition uncertainties hr nwps sm are shown each downscaled scenario is coupled with an initial soil moisture realization estimated as explained in paragraph 2 2 3 similar to the previous experiment the number of rainfall downscaled scenarios is m 400 analysing the event that occurred on 09 10 2014 fig 6 it is interesting that the box 25 75 percentile in some cases is similar to the hr nwps case and in some others hr nwps sm even leads to smaller values of the 75 percentile wrf wsm6 on the other side superimposing the two sources of uncertainty allows us to increase the maximum values thus capturing the sp in the box plot forecast and in some infrequent cases peaks are close to op the tail of the forecast peak distribution is in fact extended on the other side it must be highlighted that the variability of peaks introduced by different nwpss and by rainfall downscaling is larger than the peak due to soil moisture perturbations a similar effect can be noticed also for the other two events fig 6 3 2 probabilistic impact forecast economic losses and people affected the conversion from streamflow scenarios into damage scenarios and people affected enables the decision maker an in depth impact analysis of those events that cause some flooding this transformation involves strong non linearity as it depends on urban morphology which affects flooding dynamics extension and magnitude since the damage is strongly affected by the threshold effect caused by the overbanking level the results are shown in terms of cumulative distribution that allows a better readability with respect to the box plot representation used in section 3 1 fig 7 reports distribution of economic damage considering damage to both structure and content and highly affected people distributions for the event on 09 10 2014 the graphs indicate the effects of introducing of the multi model ensemble approach and those derived from the soil moisture initial condition variability the variable highly affected people is obtained considering the number of people who reside in high and very high risk areas i e where flow conditions water depth and velocity cause instability to people see paragraph 2 2 4 the probability of damage 0 is approximately 2 multi model ensemble or 1 multi model ensemble and soil moisture uncertainty a similar behaviour comes up for the probability of people affected fig 7 also shows that the multi model includes the estimated real event which was estimated at approximately 100 mil euro red point silvestro et al 2016 this occurs even if the observed peak is not included in the forecast the reason is that the library of scenarios includes at least one streamflow scenario with peak lower than the observed peak but with a similar overtopping volume thus leading to a similar damage scenario in the 04 11 2011 event fig 8 the estimated damage is approximately 45 m euro this value is estimated without considering the contribution of a small tributary induced flooding since it is out of the target area of this work but caused a large amount of damage during this event see silvestro et al 2012 the forecast done using only the operational model benchmark defines this scenario as extremely infrequent probability 1 while in the multi model ensemble damage distribution it has a probability of approximately 2 and in the multi model ensemble with soil moisture uncertainty the probability increases between 2 and 5 the case of 14 09 2015 has some interesting features fig 9 the streamflow reached a value of approximately 600 m3 s no inundation occurred but bisagno creek was close to overbanking the probability of damage and people affected larger than zero was negligible in both the multi model and model ensemble with soil moisture damage distributions 1 however it must be admitted that for the reasons explained in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 the predicted probabilities of damage 0 are generally low for all the events as a consequence in an operational perspective it could be not easy to interpret the forecast of 14 09 2015 differently with respect the other two events the modelling chain considers that the flooding is possible even with very low probability which could be interpreted as a false alarm analysing the three events in terms of damage we can conclude that using hr nwps seems not sufficient to improve the predictions in the sense that using a unique nwps with a high resolution does not guarantee that prediction is always and systematically improved the results of the forecast chain in terms of impacts confirm as already shown in section 3 1 that the multi model approach seems the most effective strategy to account for meteorological uncertainty instead of using a single model even if it has a high resolution and a detailed description of the atmospheric processes i e non hydrostatic convective permitting in addition the results in figs 7 9 highlight how the threshold effects introduced by overbanking level affect the damage distribution probability of damage is null for all the streamflow scenarios lower than overbanking and then suddenly increases the probability of damages is always low in the studied events but the magnitude of damage can be huge all the considerations presented are valid for the three analysed events that are important case studies rebora et al 2013 davolio et al 2017 the test of the complete forecast chain should be continued over a longer period of time which possibly includes more extreme events to confirm and generalize the present findings in other cases the system may lead to worse results in particular increasing the false alarms since it accounts for different sources of uncertainties this kind of verification was not possible because of unavailability of data moreover we believe that a deeper verification would need a specific study and this is beyond the scope of this study 4 conclusions in this work a methodology for quantitative real time impact assessment was presented the methodology based on a multi meteorological model approach also considers soil moisture uncertainty and extends the flood forecasting chain to include the quantitative real time impact assessment in terms of economic losses and affected people from the analysis of the performances some interesting and in our opinion crucial consideration arose using a multi model approach that involves different hr nwpss improves the hydro meteorological forecast of the three considered events confirming the work of parodi et al 2017 but also confirming the need for introducing a rainfall downscaling model davolio et al 2015 the benefit of a multi model approach appears evident especially considering that there is not a model or a particular model configuration that always performs evidently better than the others the multi model approach tries to explore the errors and uncertainties even if in a partial and coarse way in meteorological forecasting while high resolution seems fundamental to capture those very concentrated and intense rainfall events that affect the study area as discussed in section 3 the observed event peak flow lies always in the tail of the predicted distribution as a consequence forecasters and decision makers would have trouble in result interpretation and they are expected to read results in light of good theoretical preparedness on hydro meteorological topics accounting for soil moisture initial condition uncertainties helps to improve the results especially in the 09 10 2014 event where the methodology increased the probability of success in flood forecasting by increasing the spread of the forecast to enhance the benefit of superimposing the soil moisture uncertainty in the system one probably needs to increase the number of the scenario members increasing the demand on computation results in terms of streamflow prediction appear to be promising but the availability of data for three events only did not allow a full and extensive validation of the benefit related to the multi model approach and to the introduction of the soil moisture uncertainty specifically it was not possible to investigate the occurrence of false alarms moreover the adopted scheme for perturbing the soil moisture initial condition is based on a soil status derived by long term simulation for the sake of clarity the method does not allow consideration of space and time errors of the hydrological model thus as a consequence it could fail to properly account for the uncertainty in some situations second the proposed methodology underlines the importance of the availability of an impact forecast the transition from streamflow forecast to impact forecast in terms of economic damages and affected people increases the amount of available information for the decision making process considering only the discharge peak distribution fig 10 left panel the decision maker cannot obtain precise information on the flood impact after overtopping when comparing the distribution of discharge peaks fig 10 left panel to the related distribution of economic damage to structure and content fig 10 right panel a strong non linearity in this conversion is found as expected a small increase in discharge peak can lead to a significant increase in losses as highlighted by the blue segment and vice versa considerable increase in discharge peak may result in a minor increase in losses red segment the reason for this behaviour can be explained easily considering that the dynamics of the inundation strongly depend on urban morphology and the discharge peak is not the only influencing parameter but the shape of the hydrograph and the inundation volume also play an important role economic loss distribution can be compared with reference thresholds such as the cost of warning civil protection staff and population availability of emergency funds or a portion of city gdp considered critical for city economy the decision maker can read from the graph the probability to exceed one of these economic thresholds a crucial point of the work presented is related to the estimation of impacts and damages caused by the flash floods since the flash floods are essential to calibrate and validate the models in this application we used field measurements as well citizen claims of the damages suffered the post flash flood surveys have a key role as evidenced in some studies that emphasized the usefulness of data and information derived from post event analysis marchi et al 2009 marchi et al 2010 a possible future extension and application of this methodology may consider a regional approach given 1 the size of the watershed of the ligurian coast 2 the uncertainty in predicting the location of the meteorological event and 3 warning messages are issued for a homogeneous warning area and not for a single site it would be possible to compute impact losses for all watersheds belonging to the same warning area then a decision criterion may compare the probability of having losses with the cost of activation for the whole warning area this probability can be substantially higher with respect to the one computed in a single site while the cost of warning messages and activation for the warning area may increase more smoothly some costs of single site activation are the same for the warning area activation in any case a decision making process that includes impact forecast economic loss affected population instead of hazard parameters discharge alone would require a substantial modification of current early warning systems setup and related standard operating procedures which may delay its adoption by decision makers acknowledgements this work is supported by imprex horizon

6598,in recent years continuous improvements have been made in weather forecasting and flood prediction with great benefit from early warning systems ewss despite the continuous quest for innovation from the scientific and user communities ewss remain based mostly on hazard forecast and the information on possible consequences and potential impacts is generally missing in this work a methodology for quantitative real time impact assessment for flash floods is presented the methodology uses a multi model ensemble approach and considers soil moisture uncertainty moreover the flood forecasting chain which normally provides only the discharge probability of exceeding a given threshold is extended to include a fully 2d hydraulic model and a damage estimation model to quantitatively assess impacts in terms of economic losses and the people involved the procedure was tested on recent flood events occurring in genoa in northwestern italy this paper discusses the potential challenges and opportunities offered by this approach in the decision making workflow in an operational context keywords flood forecast probabilistic damage impacts hydrometeorology 1 introduction despite continuous improvements in weather forecasting and flood prediction floods still cause multiple casualties and significant damage to properties and infrastructures every year with adverse economic consequences for communities that can persist for many years this trend may worsen in the future if we consider the effects of climate change and urbanization according to a recent study of the european environment agency eea 2016 annual flood losses can be expected to increase fivefold by 2050 and up to 17 fold by 2080 rarely hydro meteorological forecasts are connected to quantitative potential impact estimates economic losses and people involved since hydro meteorological forecasts are generally devoted to prediction of possible flood magnitudes silvestro et al 2011 gourley et al 2014 2017 naulin et al 2013 versini et al 2014 as a consequence decisions from the authorities responsible for civil protection emergency management are based on the experience accumulated by the forecasters using their technological systems while actions to safeguard population and assets are often determined by their subjective perception of the local risk conditions while there is a realization of what the weather might be there is frequently a lack of understanding of what the weather might do wmo 2015 to improve early warning systems ewss a paradigm to shift from hazard to impact forecasts is needed recent studies proposed methodologies for rapid impact assessment and estimation of damage severity schroeder et al 2016 cole et al 2016 sai et al 2018 or direct estimation of the number of impacted buildings le bihan et al 2016 le bihan et al 2017 the economic dimension when addressed is often computed at a coarse resolution dottori et al 2017 incompatible with flash flood impact assessment needs the present approach goes one step further by computing direct economic damage and impact on the population at a building scale which will ultimately result in better contingency planning reasonable worst case and most likely outcomes the decision making process will be facilitated and put under a cost benefit perspective e g economic losses of the predicted event may be quantitatively compared to the cost of mitigation measures this approach would also improve the objective evaluation of responsibilities of forecasters and decision makers in the ews context additionally impact forecasts can contribute to a common situational awareness and a better acceptance of mitigation countermeasures by the general public the enhancement process of an early warning system relies on one hand on improving the quality of hazard forecasts by quantifying major sources of uncertainty and on the other hand on extending the modelling chain to quantitatively assess potential losses these two principles have been applied to improve the flash flood early warning system for the city of genoa which recently suffered the consequences of two devastating flash floods in 2011 and 2014 fiori et al 2014 2017 silvestro et al 2012 many modelling experiments based on forecasting chains davolio et al 2015 hally et al 2015 davolio et al 2017 have been conducted in recent years to evaluate the amount of hydrometeorological uncertainty in the prediction of the flash floods that hit the ligurian region on the northwest side of italy hereafter the liguria region one of the most recent studies parodi et al 2017 was supported by the use of a prototype distributed computing infrastructure dci developed under the eu funded projects drihm distributed research infrastructure for hydro meteorology www drihm eu and drihm2us distributed research infrastructure for hydro meteorology to us www drihm2 µs eu for studying high impact weather events hiwes with a special focus on floods and flash flood events based on the experience mentioned above this work addresses three main topics the first topic is the evaluation of possible added value of high resolution numerical weather prediction systems nwpss as input for streamflow forecasts on a study area characterized by a small basin struck by flash flood events davolio et al 2015 fiori et al 2017 the second is understanding how the uncertainties in the initial soil moisture conditions of the hydrological model can affect the forecast performance silvestro and rebora 2014 the third is extending the typical flood forecasting chain rainfall discharge water levels to quantitatively include exposure and vulnerability factors and understanding how the first two topics interact and affect the forecast in terms of impacts the analysis of flood events based on stream flow only predicts the probability of overtopping but does not provide quantitative information on the affected population and properties molinari and handmer 2011 sättele 2016 the formulation of impact scenarios is necessary to better understand the consequences of a forecast event and then to apply mitigation measures in real time as foreseen in emergency plans hazard predictions expressed as probabilistic maps of flood water depth and velocity are thus translated into impact predictions such as the probability of exceeding a given economic loss or the probability that a certain number of people can be affected by the flood 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and case studies bisagno is a basin located in northwestern italy in the liguria region the drainage area is small approximately 98 km2 and the elevations of the catchment range between 0 and 1100 m above sea level so the environment changes from mountainous to coastal with high slopes fig 1 in few kilometres the mean catchment elevation is approximately 370 m bisagno is mainly covered by forests and brushes but with a high level of urbanization along the last 10 km of the riverbed which is characterized by a high concentration of inhabited areas industries and other infrastructure highly prone to the risk of flooding because the city developed along the bisagno river bed from the outlet to the inland during the last century furthermore along the last 1 5 km the river flows underneath a heavily urbanized area and the maximum discharge under the conditions of free surface flow is approximately 700 m3 s which corresponds to a return period t 30 y streamflow values larger than the latter threshold cause a sudden reduction of the maximum discharge carried under the cover and the flow overbanking liguria is monitored through a meteo hydrological network named omirl osservatorio meteo idrologico della regione liguria as described in silvestro et al 2015a this network is the official network of the liguria region which contributes to the italian micro meteorological network operationally used by the italian civil protection department molini et al 2009 the stations furnish measurements with a time step of 5 10 min there are approximately 200 rain gauges over the region with an average density of 1 rain gauge 40 km2 the network also has stations with other sensors temperature radiation wind air humidity etc but in these cases the densities are lower than the rain gauge density the instruments are professional tipping bucket gauges with 0 2 mm accuracy maximum error with an intensity of 300 mm h of approximately 2 and they satisfy all the wmo recommendations and are regularly maintained by the regional technicians the bisagno basin is particularly well instrumented the rain gauge network density is approximately 1 rain gauge 10 km2 a water level station named passerella firpo is located near the beginning of the cover and has an upstream area of approximately 93 km2 level data can be used together with an available stage discharge curve to estimate observed streamflow three extreme rainfall events are considered for the presented analysis based on the following reasons 1 two events caused inundation with severe damages while the third event caused a streamflow that was very close to the flooding level table 1 2 these events exhibited the typical thermodynamic and kinematic features related to the occurrence of v shaped back building mesoscale convective systems in the liguria sea area rebora et al 2013 silvestro et al 2015 fiori et al 2014 2017 lagasio et al 2017 3 the results of the operational forecasting chain applied to these case studies are available to verify the quality of the new approach 2 2 impact flood forecast modelling chain the impact forecast modelling chain hereinafter proposed to extend the typical flood forecasting chain hally et al 2015 that furnishes results in terms of streamflow by adding one module for hazard spatialization flooded areas expressed in terms of water depth and velocity and one for damage computation as shown in fig 2 the final modelling chain is formed by several modelling blocks meteorological multi models at global and limited area scale a stochastic downscaling model a fully distributed hydrological model a fully 2d hydraulic model and a damage model 2 2 1 nwps benchmark and high resolution models the numerical weather prediction system nwps used in the study consists of three different non hydrostatic models harmonie arome model moloch and wrf awr model the hirlam aladin research on mesoscale operational nwp in euromed harmonie model is a convection permitting model developed by météo france and aladin this model is generally nested in the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf global model and it uses the same non hydrostatic nh dynamic core as arome france bengtsson et al 2017 describe the model setup and its similarities differences with respect to the arome france model with respect to the shortwave sw radiation parameterization the morcrette radiation scheme with an improved cloud liquid optical property scheme nielsen et al 2014 is implemented the microphysics scheme used is a one moment bulk scheme which uses a three class ice parameterization ice3 while a new turbulence scheme harmonie with racmo turbulence haratu is available no parameterization is employed for deep convection while a so called eddy diffusivity mass flux edmf parameterization is used for shallow convection the cycle 40 h1 1 of the harmonie arome is used for this study with 2 5 km grid spacing and 65 vertical model levels extending up to 10 hpa moloch is a fully compressible convection permitting model morrison and pinto 2006 davolio et al 2015 developed at the institute of atmospheric sciences and climate of the italian national research council cnr isac and is operationally combined with the bolam model from which it receives hourly lateral boundary information www isac cnr it dinamica projects forecasts the model settings for radiation turbulence and microphysics schemes used here are those of davolio et al 2015 the moloch operational configuration until the year 2017 has a grid spacing of 2 3 km and 50 vertical levels it is operational at the functional centre for meteo hydrological of the liguria region which is the institution in charge of making flood forecasting on the study area for this reason it is considered as the main benchmark in this study this choice was done to make a comparison between what the forecaster had as information before the event and what the forecaster would have had if the system analysed in this work had been available the advanced research weather research and forecasting wrf version 3 7 model is a fully compressible regional atmospheric model with terrain following the hydrostatic pressure vertical coordinate the wrf setup implemented here starts from the modelling results in lagasio et al 2017 two nested domains with respectively 5 km and 1 km grid spacings are used with the total numbers of vertical levels of 50 over the 20 km atmosphere depth explicit treatment of convection is adopted while four different types of microphysics are used for each case the wrf single moment six class scheme wsm6 hong and lim 2006 thompson thompson et al 2008 wrf double moment 6 class scheme lim et al 2010 hereafter wdm16 and morrison s double moment six class scheme morrison and pinto 2005 2006 all the analyses presented hereafter refer to the innermost domain at 1 km grid spacing the global operational ecmwf ifs nwp model simmons et al 1989 with 0 125 of grid spacing valid at 0000 utc of the same day of each event is used to initialize the three meteorological models 2 2 2 from meteorological to hydrological forecast rainfall downscaling and hydrological models the hydrological modelling suite adopted in this study is described in detail in silvestro et al 2015a and silvestro et al 2016 and it consists of a rainfall downscaling model rainfarm rebora et al 2006a 2006b and a hydrological model continuum silvestro et al 2013 rainfarm is a rainfall downscaling algorithm that produces an ensemble of rainfall scenarios that maintain some characteristics of the rainfall prediction derived by an nwps laiolo et al 2014 and can mimic the small scale variability of precipitation needed to correctly force the hydrological model the volume of precipitation predicted by the nwps is preserved by rainfarm together with the spatial and temporal structure at space and time scales that are considered reliable sr tr following the approach described in siccardi et al 2005 but each precipitation scenario reproduces a small spatial temporal variability that is present in a real rainfall field and that can be observed for example with meteorological radar as shown in rebora et al 2006b the spatial temporal fourier spectrum of the rainfall field follows the functional form 1 g k x k y ω 2 k x 2 k y 2 α 2 ω β kx and ky are the spatial wavenumbers of the and y directions ω the temporal wavenumber frequency and α and β represent two parameters of the model that are estimated from the power spectrum of rainfall forecast through the nwps in this application the reliable spatial and time scales sr tr are assumed 10 δx km where δx is the horizontal resolution of the nwps considered and 6 h based on the experience of rebora et al 2006b brussolo et al 2008 and davolio et al 2015 and considering that a meteorological model due to numerical diffusion is generally not reliable at scales smaller than six to four times its resolution patterson and orszag 1971 therefore rainfarm is constrained to keep the spatial and temporal patterns at these latter scales the final downscaled rainfall fields have a spatial resolution of 1 km and a time resolution of 60 min the rainfall scenarios built with rainfarm are used to feed continuum which is a distributed hydrological model based on a geomorphologic approach giannoni et al 2005 continuum combines semi empirical and physically based modules and it can work in a continuous way all the main physical processes that describe the hydrological cycle are modelled i e surface and sub surface flow deep flow infiltration evapotranspiration vegetation interception snow melting and accumulation a detailed description of the model can be found in silvestro et al 2013 2015b a digital elevation model dem is used to represent the catchment morphology and the flow directions are estimated calculating the directions of maximum slope each cell of the model drainage network is classified as hillslope or channel using a morphologic filter defined by the expression 2 a s k c where a is the contributing area upstream of each cell l2 s is the local slope k and c are quantities that describe the geomorphology of the basin giannoni et al 2000 and they are generally constant infiltration process and subsurface flow gabellani et al 2008 are modelled using a scheme based on a layer of reservoirs that represents the root zone silvestro et al 2013 and include a modification of the horton algorithm bauer 1974 diskin and nazimov 1994 the energy balance is computed using the force restore equation approximation dickinson 1988 that allows us to estimate as explicit output variables the soil surface temperature and the evapotranspiration the surface flow on hillslope cells is modelled using a linear reservoir scheme while flow on channel cells exploits the kinematic wave approach wooding 1965 todini and ciarapica 2001 continuum requires calibration for six parameters generally carried out at the basin scale two for the surface flow uh and uc two for the sub surface flow ct and cf and two for deep flow and water table vwmax and rf processes table 2 reports a brief description of the parameters for the current application the same implementation of davolio et al 2017 is used the model was implemented with a spatial resolution of 0 005 deg approximately 480 m based on the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm dem and the use of a corine land cover http www sinanet isprambiente it it progetti corine land cover 1 the temporal resolution used in all the experiments is 60 min in davolio et al 2017 a parameter calibration that focussed on the flood reproduction was also employed in this application the hydrological simulations always start in the coincidence of the date of initialization of the nwps as shown in table 3 2 2 3 accounting for soil moisture initial condition uncertainty the considered hydrological model is distributed and continuous therefore it is possible to produce an initial moisture condition at the beginning of each event that is derived by the physical processes simulated inside the model infiltration gravity percolation evapotranspiration to accomplish this we carried out a run of the model starting from 01 01 2011 until 12 12 2015 fed by observations the approach mentioned above should allow the reproduction of a realistic soil moisture pattern or at least a soil moisture estimation compatible with the model structure when the model is well calibrated in any case it is well known zappa et al 2011 silvestro and rebora 2014 laiolo et al 2016 that sometimes the modelled soil moisture can be highly different from the real soil moisture depending on a number of factors e g i ability of the model to reproduce the physical phenomena in a particular simulation time window ii reliability of the parameterization in that particular simulation period and iii reliability in the forcing data used to drive the model some variables such as solar radiation or wind are often poorly sampled by the ground gauge network a wrong soil moisture initial condition can thus cause over or under estimation of the streamflow prediction the over or under estimation can be evaluated in a post event analysis but it is a priori unknown in the presented analysis the uncertainty related to the hydrological model parameters was neglected essentially for two reasons on one side we used a hydrological model calibrated to reproduce high flows with good performance in reproducing these latter davolio et al 2017 on the other side various studies mascaro et al 2010 zappa et al 2011 indicated that parameter uncertainty is generally of lower magnitude with respect to uncertainties related to the rainfall forecast and to the initial wetting conditions especially for small catchments with a flash flood regime to introduce the impact of soil moisture uncertainty we generated a set of k soil moisture initial conditions starting from the one modelled with the observed meteorological variables being continuum a continuous distributed model produces the modelled state variables for each time step of the run made with observations as input in the case of soil moisture it is a two dimensional field with the same spatial resolution as the model implementation in this case 0 005 deg the mean soil moisture at basin scale with a value between 0 and 1 can easily be estimated as the mean of the values in the single pixels here after mso once the mso is estimated to account for possible modelling errors the set of k soil moisture initial condition is generated with the following steps 1 the kth mean soil moisture initial condition msk is extracted from a uniform distribution in the range mso dms mso dms where dms is set to 0 4 this is an arbitrary value based on previous analysis and on the comparison with satellite estimation laiolo et al 2016 cenci et al 2016 and means that we assumed that the maximum variability of the model soil moisture around mso is 40 of the soil moisture maximum range 0 1 2 the ratio 3 dratiosm msk mso is estimated and used to re scale the soil moisture map allowing us to change the mean soil moisture at the basin scale preserving the soil moisture pattern in this way it is assumed that the spatial pattern is generally well reproduced by the model the k soil moisture initial conditions can be combined with the m forecast rainfall fields generated with rainfarm and used to trigger the continuum model to produce mxk streamflow scenarios the perturbations applied to the original soil moisture field affect the internal coherence of the state variables specifically those related to the energy balance but this has no important consequences on the results on the time horizon of the forecast 2 3 days the energy balance negligibly affects the mass balance during such small periods 2 2 4 hydraulic modelling damages and potential affected population scenarios the 2d hydraulic model used in this work is telemac 2d which belongs to the telemac mascaret http www opentelemac org suite of models to be used for hydraulic modelling applications telemac 2d is based on the solution of the saint venant equations on a grid of triangular elements using as numerical schemes the finite element or finite volume methods the ability to model both permanent and transient conditions allows a number of operational and research applications in this application the same setup shown in silvestro et al 2016 was used the hydraulic model was calibrated to model historical flooding accurately with a special focus on the one that occurred on 09 10 2014 for this event the large availability of field measurements allowed a good estimation of the magnitude of the flood in terms of both water level and extent the model demonstrated the ability to reproduce post event field measurements the results and further details of the calibration process are presented in detail in silvestro et al 2016 direct economic loss computation was done by using the rasor rapid analysis and spatialization of risk platform rudari and the rasor team 2015 koudogbo et al 2014 that allows scenario based impact analysis across different hazards with respect to floods the direct economic loss estimation method is based on stage damage curves which provide percentage expected loss based on flood depth flood damage curves are associated with buildings according to their flood relevant features such as occupancy building usage height number of floors above and below the ground and split level presence percentage losses are then multiplied by replacement costs to obtain the economic loss for each building this study uses the same damage model configuration described in silvestro et al 2016 to compute direct damage to building structure and content in that study damage model validation was possible thanks to the damage data gathered in the aftermath of the 09 10 2014 event over 3000 citizen claims served as a benchmark for the building scale damage assessment performed through the rasor platform the modelling chain produced the estimate of the total damage with a percentage error of approximately 5 damage to vehicles water and electric systems and transport infrastructure was not considered in the present study the rasor platform was also used recently to quantify monetary flood risk mitigation benefits for the city of florence arrighi et al 2018 potential impacts on population were assessed considering that safety of people can be compromised when exposed to flows that exceed their ability to remain standing and or traverse a waterway over the last four decades numerous laboratory based experimental study regimes abt et al 1989 karvonen et al 2000 jonkman and penning rowsell 2008 jonkman et al 2009 xia et al 2014 and conceptual models love 1987 lind et al 2004 milanesi et al 2015 arrighi et al 2017 have been developed to define the limits of stability within differing flows the most common criterion to classify hazard zones is based on different values of the product between the water level h and the water speed u in this work four hazard zones very high high moderate low flood hazard were classified considering the thresholds identified by cox et al 2010 which consider the instability of adults high hazard zone and children moderate hazard zone these zones are identified by values of the product h u 0 8 m2s 1 high hazard zone and 0 4 m2s 1 h u 0 8 m2s 1 moderate hazard zone combined with another condition independent from the flow velocity which accounts for the risk of drowning maximum admissible water depth of 1 2 m for adults and 0 5 m for children jonkman et al 2009 by analysing the loss of life caused by the flooding of new orleans after hurricane katrina classified a zone with high mortality probability breach zone when h u 5 m2s 1 based on this threshold an extreme hazard zone was added the resulting four flood hazard zones can be ranked as follows extreme hazard zone when h u 5 m2s 1 high hazard zone when h 1 2 m and 0 8 m2s 1 h u 5 m2s 1 or h 1 2 m and h u 5 m2s 1 moderate hazard zone when h 0 5 m and 0 4 m2s 1 h u 0 8 m2s 1 or 0 5 m h 1 2 m and h u 0 8 m2s 1 low hazard zone when h 0 5 m and 0 m2s 1 h u 0 4 m2s 1 2 3 real time forecast of damage and population affected the rigorous method to carry out the damage forecast should be to insert into the flood forecast chain the two ingredients shown in section 2 2 4 hydraulic modelling and damage estimation for each streamflow scenario or at least for all those scenarios that overcome a certain threshold the hazard map and the damage map should be evaluated using the available models however the extended simulation chain that includes damage models would imply an additional amount of computational time and resources which may delay in time the forecast availability the study area is characterized by the fact that the part of the riverbed where the flooding starts is well known the inlet of the covered channel at approximately 2 km inland from the sea outlet is the most important point where flooding and inundation often begin this condition is certainly specific but similar situations are not so unusual in an environment made by small catchments that pass through highly urbanized areas where such structures as bridges and culverts often cause hydraulic backwater effects in this context we propose an approximate approach that allows substantial saving of computational time providing reasonable damage estimation in a quick time also in a probabilistic perspective when multiple streamflow scenarios need to be investigated a set of n streamflow scenarios was built using synthetic rainfall events as input to the hydrological model hyetographs were built following the approach of boni et al 2007 they are studied to have a small increment of a discharge peak between the ith and the ith 1 scenario around the flooding threshold then the increment increases as the severity of the event increases fig 3 each streamflow scenario with defined peak flow and flooding volume was used as input for the hydraulic model and the damage model in this way a library of damage scenarios was built and the library relates each peak flow and flooding volume to a damage estimate this library of preconfigured scenarios is used together with the hydro meteorological chain to produce probabilistic damage forecast as follows fig 3 1 generation of m streamflow scenarios with the probabilistic flood forecast chain 2 estimation of peak flow qp and flooding volume vf for each ith scenario that overcomes the flooding threshold 3 comparison of qp and vf with those available in the set of n predefined streamflow scenarios generally we will have two comparable scenarios the first with a similar qp and the second vf 4 estimation of two damage scenarios related to qp and vf for each ith streamflow scenario that overcomes the flooding threshold applying this conservative principle the larger damage is considered 5 build the forecast probabilistic distribution curve of damage relative to the population affected the previous procedure is applied to identify the scenario except that the variable to be considered is the affected population instead of economic loss in other words step 5 will be replaced by the following 5bis build the forecast probabilistic distribution curve of affected population fig 3 3 results results are presented referring to the outlet section of passerella firpo where streamflow observations are available the comparison is carried out referring to the observed peaks the peaks generated with the hydrological model fed with observations and the peaks obtained by the forecast the timing of the peak of each ensemble member is not considered the aggregation scale of nwps qpf is 6 h which is larger than the order of magnitude of the study catchment response time approximately 2 3 h the time pattern of each downscaled ensemble member is generated by rainfarm section 3 1 1 focusses on the effects on the streamflow forecast derived by the usage of available high resolution nwps while in section 3 1 2 the effects derived by the perturbation of the initial soil moisture condition were introduced section 3 2 is instead dedicated to analyse the results of the forecast in terms of impacts damage and affected population 3 1 hydrological probabilistic forecast 3 1 1 assessment of high resolution nwps the three considered events 09 10 2014 04 11 2011 and 14 09 2015 are first re forecast using the available high resolution nwps hereafter hr nwps and comparing the results with those obtained using the operational implementation of the model moloch previous analysis showed that the number of scenarios in the downscaling process of approximately 100 is normally sufficient to investigate the variability of the rainfall field produced by the downscaling silvestro and rebora 2014 however 400 downscaled rainfall scenarios are used here this choice was made to make the results still comparable with what is presented in section 3 1 2 where two sources of uncertainty were considered nwps and soil moisture in that case a larger value of m was necessary to describe the variability of the final results adequately in terms of streamflow when for instance superimposing two sources of uncertainties that can lead to contrasting directions e g a very critical rainfall scenario with a dry soil moisture initial condition in this case soil moisture initial conditions are fixed for each event for all the scenarios they are generated by the run of the hydrological model using the rainfall observations as input the probabilistic hydro meteorological chain accounts for the uncertainties in the rainfall field through the downscaling model fig 4 helps in understanding how the downscaling algorithm works panels a and b show the original rainfall field forecast with wrf wsm6 and an example of the downscaled scenario for the event on 09 10 2014 panel c shows the average precipitation accumulated on a box with dimension 2 sr rainfall accumulation on tr is conserved and the value at times 6 12 18 24 h is the same for all scenarios and equal to the deterministic value black dotted line panel d shows the average precipitation accumulated on the bisagno catchment in this case the total volume of the nwps is not conserved but we have scenarios with larger or lower total accumulation panels in fig 5 show the results for the three events in terms of box plot representation on the left column each panel represents by box plots the probabilistic forecast conditioned to the specific nwp x axis in terms of peak flow m3 s the blue diamond in each box represents the peak flow obtained with the hydrological model fed with observations hereafter sp while the black circle is the observed peak flow hereafter op on the right column panels show the results of all the nwps together in a multi model ensemble logic where every single model is given the same weight so that each peak is considered equi probable analysing the results for the 09 10 2014 event the use of hr nwps leads in various cases to an improvement in the results with respect to the benchmark considered confirming the finding of davolio et al 2015 and parodi et al 2017 that highlighted the benefit provided by increasing the horizontal spatial resolution of nwps to predict these kinds of events looking at fig 5 the range of forecast peak flows increases from a maximum of approximately 700 750 m3 s provided by the benchmark to values larger than 800 m3 s and peaking up to 1000 m3 s for the configuration wrf wsm6 model which includes also sp wrf morrison produces a forecast slightly better than benchmark only harmonie and wrf wdm16 did not exhibit an improvement of the forecast sp and op are still out of the prediction range in most of the predicted scenarios but the improvement is evident additionally for the cases of 04 11 2011 and 14 09 2015 there is an improvement of the forecast for all wrf configurations where wdm16 now appears to be one of the best configurations while harmonie provides predictions similar to the benchmark the discharge forecast driven by harmonie seems not to benefit the sm variability probably because rainfall patterns and volumes are too different from those that actually occurred the deterministic forecast obtained by feeding the hydrological model directly with rainfall derived by nwps is generally poor confirming the findings of siccardi et al 2005 the localization of the forecast precipitation is known to get increasingly important when the basin size decreases the usage of high resolution nwps does not guarantee the correct localization of precipitation even if the total volume of rainfall is satisfactorily predicted when considered at a larger scale as a consequence the flood forecast at basin scale cannot be properly addressed without rainfall downscaling on the study area considered in all the study cases the box plots include the sp and ob only for a reduced number of scenarios so the expected exceedance probability is generally low this finding is reasonable and a direct consequence of what was presented by siccardi et al 2005 and silvestro et al 2011 mainly due to the following causes i even when nwpss make a good prediction of the precipitation volume in most cases they do not describe the correct spatial and time patterns and or the rainfall localization ii since bisagno is a small catchment the reliable aggregation spatial and time scales in the downscaling process 10 20 km and 6 h in this application are comparable or larger than its size 1000 5 km and typical response time 2 3 h consequently only a limited number of scenarios combine rainfall volumes in spatial and the time structures that result in critical parameters for the study catchment silvestro et al 2015a demonstrated that even using as input the observed rainfall field if the aggregation scale increases then the observed peak is predicted with a decreasing probability in the present application we downscale the nwps rainfall prediction so it is mandatory to use an aggregation spatial scale that is similar to or larger than the bisagno basin size because of theoretical motivations patterson and orszag 1971 siccardi et al 2005 as a final consideration we can thus state that the fact of having the observed and simulated peaks in the tail of the predicted peak distribution in most of the presented cases can apparently be considered a poor result but it must be read accounting for the aforementioned considerations additionally using a given and predefined hr nwps is evidently not sufficient to have a systematic benefit while the effective strategy for the three considered events seems to use different hr nwps or the same hr nwps with different physical parameterizations namely the use of a multi model approach a single model may work well in a subset of events but might have bad performance on other case studies wrf wdm16 works well on 04 11 2011 but not on 09 10 2014 the multi model approach allows exploring the epistemic uncertainties associated with small scale processes phenomena which have a great impact on very concentrated and intense rainfall events causing flash floods 3 1 2 assessment of high resolution nwps and soil moisture uncertainties as mentioned in the previous section the differences between sp and op can be caused by a number of error sources where initial soil moisture conditions can often drive large errors in streamflow simulations in this section the results of the hydro meteorological chain accounting for soil moisture initial condition uncertainties hr nwps sm are shown each downscaled scenario is coupled with an initial soil moisture realization estimated as explained in paragraph 2 2 3 similar to the previous experiment the number of rainfall downscaled scenarios is m 400 analysing the event that occurred on 09 10 2014 fig 6 it is interesting that the box 25 75 percentile in some cases is similar to the hr nwps case and in some others hr nwps sm even leads to smaller values of the 75 percentile wrf wsm6 on the other side superimposing the two sources of uncertainty allows us to increase the maximum values thus capturing the sp in the box plot forecast and in some infrequent cases peaks are close to op the tail of the forecast peak distribution is in fact extended on the other side it must be highlighted that the variability of peaks introduced by different nwpss and by rainfall downscaling is larger than the peak due to soil moisture perturbations a similar effect can be noticed also for the other two events fig 6 3 2 probabilistic impact forecast economic losses and people affected the conversion from streamflow scenarios into damage scenarios and people affected enables the decision maker an in depth impact analysis of those events that cause some flooding this transformation involves strong non linearity as it depends on urban morphology which affects flooding dynamics extension and magnitude since the damage is strongly affected by the threshold effect caused by the overbanking level the results are shown in terms of cumulative distribution that allows a better readability with respect to the box plot representation used in section 3 1 fig 7 reports distribution of economic damage considering damage to both structure and content and highly affected people distributions for the event on 09 10 2014 the graphs indicate the effects of introducing of the multi model ensemble approach and those derived from the soil moisture initial condition variability the variable highly affected people is obtained considering the number of people who reside in high and very high risk areas i e where flow conditions water depth and velocity cause instability to people see paragraph 2 2 4 the probability of damage 0 is approximately 2 multi model ensemble or 1 multi model ensemble and soil moisture uncertainty a similar behaviour comes up for the probability of people affected fig 7 also shows that the multi model includes the estimated real event which was estimated at approximately 100 mil euro red point silvestro et al 2016 this occurs even if the observed peak is not included in the forecast the reason is that the library of scenarios includes at least one streamflow scenario with peak lower than the observed peak but with a similar overtopping volume thus leading to a similar damage scenario in the 04 11 2011 event fig 8 the estimated damage is approximately 45 m euro this value is estimated without considering the contribution of a small tributary induced flooding since it is out of the target area of this work but caused a large amount of damage during this event see silvestro et al 2012 the forecast done using only the operational model benchmark defines this scenario as extremely infrequent probability 1 while in the multi model ensemble damage distribution it has a probability of approximately 2 and in the multi model ensemble with soil moisture uncertainty the probability increases between 2 and 5 the case of 14 09 2015 has some interesting features fig 9 the streamflow reached a value of approximately 600 m3 s no inundation occurred but bisagno creek was close to overbanking the probability of damage and people affected larger than zero was negligible in both the multi model and model ensemble with soil moisture damage distributions 1 however it must be admitted that for the reasons explained in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 the predicted probabilities of damage 0 are generally low for all the events as a consequence in an operational perspective it could be not easy to interpret the forecast of 14 09 2015 differently with respect the other two events the modelling chain considers that the flooding is possible even with very low probability which could be interpreted as a false alarm analysing the three events in terms of damage we can conclude that using hr nwps seems not sufficient to improve the predictions in the sense that using a unique nwps with a high resolution does not guarantee that prediction is always and systematically improved the results of the forecast chain in terms of impacts confirm as already shown in section 3 1 that the multi model approach seems the most effective strategy to account for meteorological uncertainty instead of using a single model even if it has a high resolution and a detailed description of the atmospheric processes i e non hydrostatic convective permitting in addition the results in figs 7 9 highlight how the threshold effects introduced by overbanking level affect the damage distribution probability of damage is null for all the streamflow scenarios lower than overbanking and then suddenly increases the probability of damages is always low in the studied events but the magnitude of damage can be huge all the considerations presented are valid for the three analysed events that are important case studies rebora et al 2013 davolio et al 2017 the test of the complete forecast chain should be continued over a longer period of time which possibly includes more extreme events to confirm and generalize the present findings in other cases the system may lead to worse results in particular increasing the false alarms since it accounts for different sources of uncertainties this kind of verification was not possible because of unavailability of data moreover we believe that a deeper verification would need a specific study and this is beyond the scope of this study 4 conclusions in this work a methodology for quantitative real time impact assessment was presented the methodology based on a multi meteorological model approach also considers soil moisture uncertainty and extends the flood forecasting chain to include the quantitative real time impact assessment in terms of economic losses and affected people from the analysis of the performances some interesting and in our opinion crucial consideration arose using a multi model approach that involves different hr nwpss improves the hydro meteorological forecast of the three considered events confirming the work of parodi et al 2017 but also confirming the need for introducing a rainfall downscaling model davolio et al 2015 the benefit of a multi model approach appears evident especially considering that there is not a model or a particular model configuration that always performs evidently better than the others the multi model approach tries to explore the errors and uncertainties even if in a partial and coarse way in meteorological forecasting while high resolution seems fundamental to capture those very concentrated and intense rainfall events that affect the study area as discussed in section 3 the observed event peak flow lies always in the tail of the predicted distribution as a consequence forecasters and decision makers would have trouble in result interpretation and they are expected to read results in light of good theoretical preparedness on hydro meteorological topics accounting for soil moisture initial condition uncertainties helps to improve the results especially in the 09 10 2014 event where the methodology increased the probability of success in flood forecasting by increasing the spread of the forecast to enhance the benefit of superimposing the soil moisture uncertainty in the system one probably needs to increase the number of the scenario members increasing the demand on computation results in terms of streamflow prediction appear to be promising but the availability of data for three events only did not allow a full and extensive validation of the benefit related to the multi model approach and to the introduction of the soil moisture uncertainty specifically it was not possible to investigate the occurrence of false alarms moreover the adopted scheme for perturbing the soil moisture initial condition is based on a soil status derived by long term simulation for the sake of clarity the method does not allow consideration of space and time errors of the hydrological model thus as a consequence it could fail to properly account for the uncertainty in some situations second the proposed methodology underlines the importance of the availability of an impact forecast the transition from streamflow forecast to impact forecast in terms of economic damages and affected people increases the amount of available information for the decision making process considering only the discharge peak distribution fig 10 left panel the decision maker cannot obtain precise information on the flood impact after overtopping when comparing the distribution of discharge peaks fig 10 left panel to the related distribution of economic damage to structure and content fig 10 right panel a strong non linearity in this conversion is found as expected a small increase in discharge peak can lead to a significant increase in losses as highlighted by the blue segment and vice versa considerable increase in discharge peak may result in a minor increase in losses red segment the reason for this behaviour can be explained easily considering that the dynamics of the inundation strongly depend on urban morphology and the discharge peak is not the only influencing parameter but the shape of the hydrograph and the inundation volume also play an important role economic loss distribution can be compared with reference thresholds such as the cost of warning civil protection staff and population availability of emergency funds or a portion of city gdp considered critical for city economy the decision maker can read from the graph the probability to exceed one of these economic thresholds a crucial point of the work presented is related to the estimation of impacts and damages caused by the flash floods since the flash floods are essential to calibrate and validate the models in this application we used field measurements as well citizen claims of the damages suffered the post flash flood surveys have a key role as evidenced in some studies that emphasized the usefulness of data and information derived from post event analysis marchi et al 2009 marchi et al 2010 a possible future extension and application of this methodology may consider a regional approach given 1 the size of the watershed of the ligurian coast 2 the uncertainty in predicting the location of the meteorological event and 3 warning messages are issued for a homogeneous warning area and not for a single site it would be possible to compute impact losses for all watersheds belonging to the same warning area then a decision criterion may compare the probability of having losses with the cost of activation for the whole warning area this probability can be substantially higher with respect to the one computed in a single site while the cost of warning messages and activation for the warning area may increase more smoothly some costs of single site activation are the same for the warning area activation in any case a decision making process that includes impact forecast economic loss affected population instead of hazard parameters discharge alone would require a substantial modification of current early warning systems setup and related standard operating procedures which may delay its adoption by decision makers acknowledgements this work is supported by imprex horizon

6599,urban residents are becoming more aware of water scarcity issues and paying greater attention to their total water consumption simultaneously perceptions of what is considered drinkable water are also evolving the present study examines whether attitudinal evaluations of stormwater influence the public acceptance of stormwater that is treated and sourced through managed aquifer recharge mar it was hypothesised that treated stormwater used for non potable purposes would be more acceptable amongst participants and that select psychological factors perceptions values and norms would be significant predictors of public acceptance for mar participants n 408 took part in an online survey which measured public acceptance of stormwater social norms stormwater attitudes water beliefs and water conservation culture these factors were experimentally examined across two different types of water use drinking water or non drinking water multiple regression analysis demonstrated that stormwater end use and selected psychological factors accounted for 79 of variance in acceptance of stormwater while there was significantly higher acceptance for the use of mar for non drinking purposes overall end use was a weak predictor of public acceptance for mar the most important predictors of acceptance were social norms and value driven attitudes towards stormwater results showed that perceptions of approval from important others e g family and friends and personal moral values were influential in explaining acceptance for stormwater interestingly water conservation culture was a negative predictor of acceptance where people who believed that conserving water was part of the australian lifestyle tended to have lower acceptance for a supplemental stormwater supply these people were more likely to support initiatives encouraging conservation of water use as key to managing water supplies the findings articulate the need to consider existing public attitudes and norms within communities where alternative resources are proposed to inform policy and practice keywords norms culture water conservation managed aquifer recharge waste water treated water 1 introduction in many urban centres population growth and greater densification are driving a change in resource consumption habits in the face of uncertain climatic conditions people are thinking more deeply about their own resource use as well as that of their local towns and cities mankad and tucker 2013 this is particularly true of urban water consumption with people becoming mindful not only of their total consumption but also of the sources from which their water originates at the same time perceptions of what is considered drinkable water and what is not are evolving the focus of this study is the reuse of urban stormwater runoff where the capture and use of urban stormwater can form a key component of integrated urban water management philp et al 2008 define stormwater as runoff from surfaces in predominantly urban environment such as pavements roofs and roads interestingly the volume of stormwater runoff in major australian cities typically exceeds the volume of water drawn from their centralised catchments and groundwater sources commonwealth of australia 2015 therefore the reuse of this resource can have wide ranging benefits such as providing an alternative water supply to reduce pressure on existing water supply systems philp et al 2008 the psychology of water use and subsequent reuse is a fascinating topic and one that is still not fully understood research has focused on negative emotional responses to water reuse such as disgust better known as the yuck factor originally discussed by marks et al 2003 as well as motivational and attitudinal factors that can contribute to water use behaviours e g social norms and beliefs cialdini et al 1991 nolan et al 2008 and perceptions of threat e g dolnicar and hurlimann 2009 mankad and greenhill 2014 the general consensus in the literature cited here is that psychological factors such as norms and attitudinal beliefs do indeed influence acceptance of water reuse technology and related water use behaviours 1 1 norms the perception of what is normal water consumption behaviour is dependent upon various contextual influences as well as the attitudes and behaviour of important others the normalisation of particular attitudes and behaviours develops through social observations perceived social benefits and observable social sanctions that are consequences of particular water use behaviours dolnicar and hurlimann 2009 nancarrow et al 2009 this normative assessment is a key psychological process that regulates personal opinion on the matter of water use as well as the social expression of one s stance on water consumption in psychology norms are social conventions for individuals personal norms and groups social norms norms reflect what people do and what they think others should do in different situations cialdini et al 1991 cialdini et al 1990 as a form of social influence and conformity norms are shaped by values cultural customs and traditions they can be experienced as a guide for behaviour as well as feelings of obligation to behave in a certain way cialdini et al 1998 personal norms were first operationalised by schwartz 1968 1977 as personal expectations for one s own behaviour in a given context importantly social norms are distinct from attitudes in that norms rely on moral evaluations important to the individual whereas attitudes can form based on social experiences perceived outcomes and psychological expectations fishbein and ajzen 1975 harland et al 1999 under the umbrella of social norms sit descriptive and injunctive norms descriptive norms reflect behavioural perceptions of what others are doing while injunctive norms reflect perceptions of whether important others would approve of particular behaviours in a given situation cialdini et al 1990 both types of norms give rise to social pressure on what is acceptable or unacceptable social behaviour the use of personal and social norms has been established in the proenvironmental behaviour literature when examining peoples sense of moral obligation to perform environmentally friendly actions e g harland et al 1999 a review by thomas and sharp thomas and sharp 2013 noted that when a person believed important others were carrying out a particular proenvironmental behaviour e g recycling that individual was more encouraged to change their own behaviour than if they were simply exposed to a general social expectation to engage in recycling further the more visible the behaviour e g i see my neighbour recycling the greater the normalisation of that proenvironmental behaviour water use norms can be influenced by culture and traditions surrounding water sourcing and collection as well as normative observations of what is socially acceptable within a referent group allon and sofoulis 2006 this means that people will likely view some types of alternative water as suitable for domestic uses and other sources of water as totally unacceptable fielding et al 2015 nancarrow et al 2010 for example the direct reuse of wastewater amongst lower socioeconomic groups in developing countries is considered acceptable because it is an observable practice within that environment and the use of that water is a necessary means of survival sato et al 2013 united nations university institute for water 2013 in contrast if the same water reuse practices were suddenly applied in australia that behaviour may be met with a negative and potentially emotional response because it may violate traditions of water reuse prevalent in that context nancarrow et al 2008 therefore the domestic use of alternative water sources challenges existing perceptions of cleanliness and of cultural acceptability in some contexts acceptance may differ between different community groups and the different types of water qualities in question thus understanding normative influence is key to understanding acceptance of non traditional water sources in the water resource domain norms have been used to explain conservation behaviour and to develop strategies for demand management using the theory of planned behaviour e g fielding et al 2013 russell and fielding 2010 walton and hume 2011 however there has been little empirical examination of norms in the literature surrounding domestic use of alternative or non traditional urban water sources the limited research that has been conducted utilising social norms in explaining attitudes and intentions toward the consumption of alternative water sources has shown similar results to that of the general pro environmental behaviour research for example dolnicar and hurlimann 2009 examined social norms as an antecedent to intentions to drink recycled and desalinated water and found that important others evaluations of behaviour were key to explaining these intentions however as mankad and tapsuwan 2011 note there is often little examination of whether intentions actually translate into actual water reuse behaviours experimental research has also identified personal norms as robust predictors of acceptance of policy for the maintenance of domestic rainwater tanks a high sense of moral obligation that domestic tanks should be maintained was linked to greater acceptance of interventions that encouraged or monitored maintenance of the tanks walton and gardner 2014 a meta analysis of psychosocial determinants of proenvironmental behaviour including water conservation behaviour identified personal or moral norms as the third highest predictor of intention after attitude and behavioural control bamberg and möser 2007 1 2 attitudes and beliefs the psychological construct of attitude has been the focus of much research in the social and behavioural sciences arguably in the context of water reuse attitudes are pre existing dispositions that unconsciously guide whether an alternative water initiative is received well or is met with initial resistance attitudes are generally conceptualised as developing through an evaluative process comprising attribute dimensions such as good bad harmful beneficial and pleasant unpleasant ajzen 2001 ajzen and fishbein 2000 eagly and chaiken 1993 research further suggests that attitudes are not permanent but can change based on new information and experiences a new attitude can override an old one but may not replace it salient attitudes are retrieved based on the relevant context or as a habitual reaction to the attitude object wilson et al 2000 for example a person may be inherently opposed to using treated stormwater for potable uses old attitude however due to an extended period of drought in the region context the person may now be open to the idea of reusing stormwater new attitude because of the changed environmental context and threatened water supply new information it is important to distinguish attitudes from affect with attitudes requiring a cognitive evaluation of an object and affects describing general moods or specific emotions ajzen 2001 importantly attitudes can be jointly influenced by cognitive evaluations and affect some research further suggests that when cognitions and affect regarding an object hold different valences the influence of affect tends to dominate the attitude e g eagly and chaiken 1993 lavine et al 1998 within the psychology domain attitudes are conceptualised in various ways the most widely used approach is the value expectancy model which states that the evaluative meaning behind attitudes forms as we develop different beliefs about an object and assign subjective values to this information ajzen and fishbein 2000 while multiple belief attributes can influence an attitude only those beliefs that are most salient noticeable at any given time impact a relevant attitude beliefs that are regularly accessed provide the basis for relatively more stable attitudes ajzen 2001 however once again the context within which the attitudes are accessed can temporarily make certain beliefs more readily accessible and can influence a positive or negative valence ajzen et al 1999 similarly cialdini et al 1990 caution that although normative attitudes have the potential to guide behaviour within a society they are not rigid or uniform across all contexts and can only motivate and guide behaviour when elicited general attitudes towards alternative water sources can also develop based on past experiences with water e g an urban vs rural upbringing subjective or perceived knowledge about a water source and norms about water quality and propriety e g mankad and gardner 2016 perceptions of water consumption issues such as water wastage future water security and general environmental concern can also contribute to attitudes and beliefs about how water should be used and the acceptability of non traditional water alternatives a review by mankad and tapsuwan mankad and tapsuwan 2011 indicated that the most common attitude towards alternative water was tentative acceptance moderated by perceptions of health risk concern for water security confidence in water treatment technology and trust in water administrators to govern a new water source social influences such as water culture e g values placed on water by a community environmental concern and knowledge of water sourcing have also been found in the literature to influence social acceptance of alternative water mankad and tapsuwan 2011 water culture particularly in regions where water has traditionally been abundant or scarce such as in australia has a pervasive influence on how water might be used and planned for in daily activities in some instances water culture has a strong role in shaping national identity and citizens may pride themselves on the ways in which water plays a role in recreational activities or domestic habits fielding et al 2012 for example in regions where water is abundant recreational water play might be synonymous with tourism in that region in contrast arid regions may pride themselves on demand management or water reuse initiatives in place e g newater in singapore public utilities board 2018 such a focus on conservation can also be present amongst groups or individuals who identify themselves as environmentally aware and have a desire to manage their water use footprint further subjective preferences about water sourcing which might be influenced by perceived knowledge about a water source or personal experience with that source may lead some people to focus on reducing user demand of domestic water fielding et al 2012 individuals may also be influenced by beliefs that recycling or reusing treated water is needed to strengthen future water security public concern for water security has been demonstrated in past psychological research in the water domain e g see mankad and walton 2015 in particular research has shown that people living in urban areas are concerned about the availability of domestic water in the future as climatic events produce more extreme dry weather events and water restrictions become more commonplace dolnicar and hurlimann 2009 furthermore people have a clear preference for an apolitical approach to addressing water security issues as the issue will likely affect multiple generations and require a clear vision of how water will be sourced and used in a city of the future brown et al 2009 mankad and tucker 2013 mankad et al 2015 as brown et al 2007 and more recently mankad et al 2015 reported urban citizens generally believe that future water policies need to be developed in concert with sustainability leaders to produce workable solutions that will still be relevant in the years to come and not restricted by the institutional limitations of the present perceptions of water wastage are also quite salient within urban environments that have a history of water constraints and people often want to be seen as using water rather than wasting it kurz et al 2005 leonard et al 2015 mankad et al 2015 reported that when asked about stormwater urban residents saw the harvesting of stormwater as saving water that would otherwise be wasted down the drain participants also cited the reuse of stormwater as preferable to a process like desalination which took water from the ocean to create new water a prevailing attitude amongst the general population in modern times as extreme climate variability becomes the norm is that water is a socially valued resource interestingly research into rainwater tanks has identified that while this shared water value notion existed amongst the general population once an alternative water resource such as rainwater was available to households many people reported a strong sense of ownership towards the water on their property residents felt as though water were a personal commodity rather than a shared community resource farbotko et al 2014 gardiner 2009 this shift in perception is likely due to the personal financial commitments required to install a rainwater tank and maintain it it is interesting to note that greater personal investment in water infrastructure tends to reflect a greater sense of proprietorship over water whatever the beliefs that exist within a community it is clear that attitudes and norms encompassing both personal obligations and social pressures are key to understanding public acceptance of alternative water initiatives 1 3 present study the present study focuses on whether attitudinal evaluations of stormwater influence acceptance of stormwater treated and sourced through managed aquifer recharge mar specifically the role of psychological variables i e perceptions values norms in explaining stormwater acceptance is evaluated it is hoped that this research will establish the relevance of psychological constructs in explaining public acceptance of treated stormwater using managed aquifer recharge and determining whether the type of proposed stormwater use influences acceptance there are relatively few studies exploring community perspectives towards urban water reuse of stormwater and or managed aquifer recharge alexander 2010 mankad and walton 2015 wu et al 2012 in some urban centres the use of mar is more likely than the use of recycled water therefore this study will provide increased knowledge regarding community attitudes and views towards stormwater reuse this information can be useful in planning and implementing successful alternative water resources within an urban society based on past research discussed in earlier sections we hypothesise that people will be more accepting of non potable uses for treated stormwater and that psychological factors perceptions values and norms will be significant in explaining drivers of public acceptance 2 methods 2 1 participants participants were randomly recruited from an external database of south australian residents based on predetermined selection criteria i e required to be permanent residents of adelaide 18 years old or more those who chose to participate received a nominal reward opportunity prize draw entry used by the participant recruitment company the research team did not offer any additional incentives the sample n 408 comprised 43 females and 57 males ages ranged from 18 to 55 years 18 34 years 21 35 54 years 43 and 55 years and over 36 when compared to census data within the target region the sample was slightly over representative of females and people over the age of 55 than the general population abs 2011 a range of socioeconomic and education backgrounds were represented with the largest group of participants reporting household incomes of less than 60 000 42 and almost half of participants 44 completing some form of higher education bachelors or post graduate qualifications income and education levels were representative of the broader adelaide population adelaide city council 2015 australian bureau of statistics abs 2011 2 2 measures 2 2 1 experimental manipulation end use proposed water end use was operationalised as an experimental variable in this study participants were randomly assigned to one of two survey groups 1 drinking water or 2 non drinking water the drinking water or potable use condition was outlined as a proposed scenario where stormwater would be collected and treated such that it could then be mixed into the city s current water supply see fig 1 the water would then receive a final treatment along with the rest of the mains water supply and be distributed to homes and businesses via the existing centralised mains water network this option was framed as an equitable lower cost method using existing infrastructure the non potable or non drinking water condition proposed that stormwater would be collected and pre treated naturally in a wetland it would then be recharged into an underground aquifer and then distributed via a new separate third pipe network this separate network wouldn t be connected to the city s main drinking water supply these two scenarios were chosen to represent the simplest and most plausible ways that stormwater could be reused in this region for potable and non potable use 2 2 2 public acceptance of stormwater public acceptance of stormwater was measured using two items reflecting willingness to use treated stormwater and the extent to which individuals favoured using treated stormwater for drinking non drinking depending on the randomly assigned scenario eriksson et al 2006 response scales were 1 5 with lower numbers indicating lower acceptance r 4 0 6 0 83 2 2 3 descriptive and personal norms descriptive norms are attitudes concerning one s perception of how important others would support a particular behaviour such as potable and non potable uses of treated stormwater ajzen 2002 cialdini et al 1990 nolan et al 2008 four items were used e g i believe my family would support the use of treated stormwater for i believe my friends would support the use of treated stormwater for response scales used a 5 point likert scale 1 strongly disagree 5 strongly agree α 0 94 personal norms are distinct from descriptive norms and reflect internal values and expectations of one s own behaviour schwartz 1968 1977 personal norms create a sense of personal obligation to undertake a certain behaviour three items were used e g i would feel morally obliged to use treated stormwater for i would feel guilty if i didn t support the use of treated stormwater for adapted from previous research abrahamse et al 2009 bamberg and möser 2007 harland et al 1999 response scales used a 5 point likert scale 1 strongly disagree 5 strongly agree α 0 88 2 2 4 attitudes towards stormwater five attitude items were used to measure attitudes towards one of two different uses of treated stormwater presented as part of the experimental design the stem read i think that using treated stormwater for drinking non drinking would be bad good harmful beneficial worthless valuable unpleasant pleasant foolish wise ajzen 1991 response scales used a 5 point semantic differential scale e g 1 extremely bad 5 extremely good α 0 92 2 2 5 water security beliefs three items assessed perceptions of the city s water security and were developed from earlier qualitative research alexander 2010 mankad et al 2015 e g having a secure water supply is important in this city we as a community should think about the long term supply of water response scales used a 5 point likert scale 1 strongly disagree 5 strongly agree α 0 90 2 2 6 water wasting beliefs four items measured attitudes towards wasting water e g i think wasting water is bad and we as a community should cherish water adapted from previous research into frugality fujii 2006 response scales used a 5 point likert scale 1 strongly disagree 5 strongly agree α 0 83 2 2 7 water conservation culture a single item was included as a separate measure of australian water conservation culture conserving water is part of the australian lifestyle to assess perceptions of water in australia and the value placed on water by the community australia is a country that experiences regular water shortages necessitating domestic conservation of water therefore measuring the perception of water conservation culture was deemed important for this study 2 3 procedure surveys were conducted online and took approximately 15 min to complete the order of questions was randomised to control for order effects schuman et al 1981 participants were initially sent an email with an external survey link inviting them to participate in the survey they were provided with information about the study and indicated consent prior to commencing initial screening questions were used to ensure participants met the inclusion criteria of being a resident of adelaide 18 years and over and connected to the reticulated water supply participants were asked not to use any online search engines while they completed the survey so as not to influence their survey responses as per ethical procedures the surveys were anonymous and completed surveys were saved on an encrypted database the study was fully conducted in accordance with ethics approval from the human research ethics committee 2 4 data analysis all multi item measures were tested for reliability and separate scales developed for each variable using averages of the items within each scale independent samples t tests were used to compare means across the socio psychological variables for the two proposed end use scenarios potable and non potable multiple regression was used to predict the variance in public acceptance of stormwater taking into account the type of end use 3 results 3 1 descriptive analyses acceptance of stormwater on average there was strong support among respondents for non potable and potable use of treated stormwater see table 1 with only 3 of respondents not in favour of non potable reuse and 14 not in favour of potable reuse 3 2 differences between proposed uses potable and non potable independent samples t tests examined the significance in differences between scores for the two proposed end uses of treated stormwater non potable and potable for acceptance of stormwater and the six socio psychological variables descriptive norms personal norms attitudes water security beliefs waste beliefs and water conservation culture scores were significantly different for acceptance and for three of the socio psychological variables descriptive norms personal norms and attitudes see table 1 there were no statistically significant differences between recommended end uses for beliefs related to water security waste and water conservation culture between the two scenarios acceptance and overall attitudes towards stormwater were higher for those in the non potable reuse condition and ratings of descriptive and personal norms were also higher in the non potable reuse condition not surprisingly enduring beliefs about water security waste and a culture for conserving water were similar across both proposed use scenarios 3 3 predicting acceptance from end use and psychological variables a multiple regression was conducted to assess the extent to which acceptance for stormwater could be explained by end use and psychological factors using the total sample end use and the six psychological factors were entered into the regression table 2 summarises the descriptive statistics for mean scores and bivariate correlations between acceptance and the six psychological variables results showed that type of stormwater use and the psychological factors accounted for 79 of the variance in acceptance of stormwater r 2 0 79 adjusted r 2 0 79 f 7 400 218 070 p 001 end use and five of the six psychological variables were significant individual predictors of acceptance p 05 descriptive norms personal norms and attitudes towards stormwater were the most important predictors of acceptance water security beliefs water conservation culture and end use were statistically significant but weaker predictors water conservation culture was a negative predictor water wasting beliefs were non significant predictors of acceptance table 3 shows the standardised coefficients for each of the variables 4 discussion this study demonstrated that psychological factors explained a high proportion of variance in public acceptance of stormwater treated via managed aquifer recharge interestingly results also clearly showed that proposed end use of treated stormwater i e the way in which stormwater would be utilised drinking vs non drinking was a significant but considerably less influential factor in public acceptance the regression model showed that social pressure to behave in a way that would be supported by important others e g family and friends was the number one predictor of acceptance for stormwater reuse and that those norms would be an important factor in individuals decision to use treated stormwater this finding has important on ground implications with the suggestion that acceptance of alternative water could be facilitated if the reuse of stormwater were to be normalised in some way such as communicating or demonstrating that everyone is doing it dolnicar et al 2010 while the latter example may sound simplistic the type of framing used may elicit positive social pressures that lead to more expedient outcomes such as community acceptance driven by individual need to behave consistently with what important others are doing steg and vlek 2009 at a fundamental level the results suggest that participants were using cognitive shortcuts when forming opinions about stormwater reuse that is individuals were typically relying on their beliefs about what important others would do as a mental substitute for their own judgement on whether stormwater reuse was acceptable or not this suggestion is supported by other research in public acceptance of alternative water infrastructure for example ishii and boyer ishii and boyer 2016 demonstrated the effect of subjective descriptive norms in their study of acceptance for urine separating toilets for water conservation they found the majority of respondents perceived broader community support for urine separation infrastructure and this was positively related to the likelihood that one perceived urine source separation as a good idea a proxy such as this is often utilised in decision making situations where individuals have low knowledge or high uncertainty zeelenberg et al 2008 given the novelty of the stormwater application presented in this study participants were likely insufficiently familiar with the topic to make their own decisions about stormwater use an applied focus on normalising the use of alternative water sources can be a valuable strategy in future messaging around novel water technologies nolan et al 2008 targeting social and cultural norms provides opportunities for people to observe what others are doing and how stormwater is being used for its intended purpose e g potable or non potable this type of observational knowledge can also help to increase perceptions that the use of stormwater is a widely accepted behaviour nolan et al 2008 argue that the persuasive impact of normative social influence is effective in changing behaviour their research examined energy conservation and found that descriptive normative beliefs were better at predicting behaviour than more context specific attitudes and beliefs nolan and colleagues findings mirror those from the present study where social norms were stronger predictors in the acceptance model than attitudes towards stormwater the second strongest predictor in our model was personal norms which were almost as important as descriptive norms personal norms were defined as intrinsic expectations for one s own behaviour based on personal values of right and wrong as well as feelings of moral obligation participants in this study relied on feelings of personal and social obligation to determine their acceptance for treated stormwater as a potable or non potable water source feelings of guilt and a moral duty to supplement existing water supplies with a treated usable source of alternative water influenced participants to accept recharged stormwater as a potential urban water source drawing on the review by thomas and sharp 2013 the joint influence of descriptive and personal norms in predicting acceptance in this study was likely due to the combining influence of these two normative drivers not only did people believe that important others would accept stormwater reuse but also they themselves believed it was a social and moral expectation to reuse treated stormwater which likely contributed to a stronger overall effect this finding ties in with the less dominant but still significant influence of the two water related beliefs of water security and water conservation culture while each individual predictor had a small overall influence in the model the net result illustrates that there was a clear cognitive association between personal expectations for behaviour driven by moral obligation personal norms and personal beliefs around socially responsible water use linked to feelings of duty and responsibility to secure local water supplies for the future these feelings may also be linked to the traditional culture amongst australians where water is viewed as a precious and unpredictable resource mankad and gardner 2016 counter to what would be expected a personal attitude towards wasting water was not a significant predictor of acceptance for using stormwater for non potable or potable uses via managed aquifer recharge one explanation for this could be that the measures used did not adequately reflect the notion that capturing stormwater was an opportunity for avoiding the waste of water that would otherwise be lost which was described in previous qualitative research on stormwater mankad et al 2015 rather the measures used in the present study were broad dispositional measures about waste future research could explore ways to measure the concept of waste in relation to different water technologies and how they are linked to social norms and broader cultural values around natural resource use interestingly water conservation culture was found to be a negative predictor of stormwater acceptance that is the stronger the belief that conserving water was part of the australian lifestyle the lower the acceptance for treated stormwater as a potable or non potable source this finding arguably speaks to a much broader cultural issue around water use as suggested earlier traditionally life in australia was characterised by one of restraint and hardiness because of the sometimes harsh climatic conditions experienced in rural and remote australia mankad et al 2010 thus a culture of self sufficiency developed amongst citizens and australians began to identify themselves as successfully able to thrive in times of water abundance and drought simply by learning to modifying their water demand management behaviours allon and sofoulis 2006 this belief in self discipline to simply use less when environmental conditions required particularly amongst a sample from one of the most water stressed regions in australia may explain the surprisingly negative relationship between acceptance of mar and a belief that the australian lifestyle was characterised by a water conservation culture this model may suggest then that people who believe that conserving water is simply part of the australian lifestyle tend not to support initiatives to increase water availability rather they are more likely to support initiatives that encourage the conservation of water use as key to managing water supplies thus they may also be less likely to support funding directed towards supplementing existing water supplies with alternative choices in this study the way in which attitudes towards stormwater were presented and evaluated drinking vs non drinking meant that people were presented with two extreme characteristics of stormwater which allowed them to evaluate simplified costs and benefits of managed aquifer recharge of stormwater these attitudinal assessments of these options were value driven in that the results provide insight into underlying beliefs about how beneficial or agreeable treated stormwater might be to them and whether the use of treated stormwater is a safe and advantageous course of action to take as with all previous social research canvassing public acceptance of alternative water sources participants in this study were more likely to accept the use of treated stormwater if it were proposed for non potable end uses a less risky option that poortvliet et al 2018 suggest can result in more favourable evaluation by the public however the predictive influence of end use type was superseded in the regression model by the influence of social norms and water values for treatment options that are relatively new and thus unfamiliar people may not be able to generate strong opinions about them and so retreat to a position of relative safety therefore it is unsurprising that participants were more influenced by their social environment and cultural context when deciding whether treated stormwater was acceptable poortvliet et al 2018 in addition acceptance of potential changes that would impact everyone in a community rather than selected individuals would be expected to be more strongly driven by normative influences than by attitudes since normative influences reflect perceptions of a more community level view while water security beliefs were not dominant in predicting stormwater acceptance on their own the high average scores across the sample suggests that securing water for the future matters a great deal to this community further this belief is linked to acceptance of stormwater as a supplement to existing water supplies if the introduction of managed aquifer recharge of stormwater were to be introduced and it were framed as a key means of securing the water supply in the region for the long term public acceptance for the initiative would be expected to be higher regardless of whether it was proposed as a non potable or potable water source research on the influence of broader environmental values such as water security de groot and steg 2010 steg et al 2005 supports the notion that those who value particular environment benefits or outcomes are more likely to accept novel solutions that align with their values 5 conclusions the findings from this study articulate three main considerations for the future firstly plans to use treated stormwater need to consider public attitudes and norms that exist within the community in which the novel resource will be implemented importantly attitudes and norms relevant to the stormwater context will be important drivers of acceptance and could potentially be applied to messaging about the new technology secondly if the community shows a strong preference for supporting the conservation of water it may be more difficult to gain public acceptance for the development of alternative water sources that involve new or unfamiliar technologies if residents in a particular area believe that everybody just needs to be more careful with the water we have then there may be reduced motivation to accept a novel technology such as managed aquifer recharge for managing water resources even if it is to augment supply it would be valuable for future research to explore this issue and determine whether initiatives that propose more water versus those that propose more efficient use of water differ in their level of normative influence moreover solutions that both safeguard the future security of water for a growing population in combination with preserving a conservation culture toward water use could be explored in this instance additional resources may be needed to engage with people to explain that in conditions of extreme scarcity conservation measures may not be sufficient to address shortages future research could also examine more specific cost benefit influences on acceptance and decision making around stormwater reuse where approximate infrastructure costs could be articulated more accurately and used as a predictor of acceptance this future work would test the relative influence of values and norms in the context of infrastructure costs which may provide a mediating influence on acceptance finally it is clear that public acceptance of stormwater is not simply determined by the type of end use rather people s level of acceptance is developed through complex socially driven assessment based on cultural and community norms as well as individual beliefs and values about appropriate water use and conservation declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing

6599,urban residents are becoming more aware of water scarcity issues and paying greater attention to their total water consumption simultaneously perceptions of what is considered drinkable water are also evolving the present study examines whether attitudinal evaluations of stormwater influence the public acceptance of stormwater that is treated and sourced through managed aquifer recharge mar it was hypothesised that treated stormwater used for non potable purposes would be more acceptable amongst participants and that select psychological factors perceptions values and norms would be significant predictors of public acceptance for mar participants n 408 took part in an online survey which measured public acceptance of stormwater social norms stormwater attitudes water beliefs and water conservation culture these factors were experimentally examined across two different types of water use drinking water or non drinking water multiple regression analysis demonstrated that stormwater end use and selected psychological factors accounted for 79 of variance in acceptance of stormwater while there was significantly higher acceptance for the use of mar for non drinking purposes overall end use was a weak predictor of public acceptance for mar the most important predictors of acceptance were social norms and value driven attitudes towards stormwater results showed that perceptions of approval from important others e g family and friends and personal moral values were influential in explaining acceptance for stormwater interestingly water conservation culture was a negative predictor of acceptance where people who believed that conserving water was part of the australian lifestyle tended to have lower acceptance for a supplemental stormwater supply these people were more likely to support initiatives encouraging conservation of water use as key to managing water supplies the findings articulate the need to consider existing public attitudes and norms within communities where alternative resources are proposed to inform policy and practice keywords norms culture water conservation managed aquifer recharge waste water treated water 1 introduction in many urban centres population growth and greater densification are driving a change in resource consumption habits in the face of uncertain climatic conditions people are thinking more deeply about their own resource use as well as that of their local towns and cities mankad and tucker 2013 this is particularly true of urban water consumption with people becoming mindful not only of their total consumption but also of the sources from which their water originates at the same time perceptions of what is considered drinkable water and what is not are evolving the focus of this study is the reuse of urban stormwater runoff where the capture and use of urban stormwater can form a key component of integrated urban water management philp et al 2008 define stormwater as runoff from surfaces in predominantly urban environment such as pavements roofs and roads interestingly the volume of stormwater runoff in major australian cities typically exceeds the volume of water drawn from their centralised catchments and groundwater sources commonwealth of australia 2015 therefore the reuse of this resource can have wide ranging benefits such as providing an alternative water supply to reduce pressure on existing water supply systems philp et al 2008 the psychology of water use and subsequent reuse is a fascinating topic and one that is still not fully understood research has focused on negative emotional responses to water reuse such as disgust better known as the yuck factor originally discussed by marks et al 2003 as well as motivational and attitudinal factors that can contribute to water use behaviours e g social norms and beliefs cialdini et al 1991 nolan et al 2008 and perceptions of threat e g dolnicar and hurlimann 2009 mankad and greenhill 2014 the general consensus in the literature cited here is that psychological factors such as norms and attitudinal beliefs do indeed influence acceptance of water reuse technology and related water use behaviours 1 1 norms the perception of what is normal water consumption behaviour is dependent upon various contextual influences as well as the attitudes and behaviour of important others the normalisation of particular attitudes and behaviours develops through social observations perceived social benefits and observable social sanctions that are consequences of particular water use behaviours dolnicar and hurlimann 2009 nancarrow et al 2009 this normative assessment is a key psychological process that regulates personal opinion on the matter of water use as well as the social expression of one s stance on water consumption in psychology norms are social conventions for individuals personal norms and groups social norms norms reflect what people do and what they think others should do in different situations cialdini et al 1991 cialdini et al 1990 as a form of social influence and conformity norms are shaped by values cultural customs and traditions they can be experienced as a guide for behaviour as well as feelings of obligation to behave in a certain way cialdini et al 1998 personal norms were first operationalised by schwartz 1968 1977 as personal expectations for one s own behaviour in a given context importantly social norms are distinct from attitudes in that norms rely on moral evaluations important to the individual whereas attitudes can form based on social experiences perceived outcomes and psychological expectations fishbein and ajzen 1975 harland et al 1999 under the umbrella of social norms sit descriptive and injunctive norms descriptive norms reflect behavioural perceptions of what others are doing while injunctive norms reflect perceptions of whether important others would approve of particular behaviours in a given situation cialdini et al 1990 both types of norms give rise to social pressure on what is acceptable or unacceptable social behaviour the use of personal and social norms has been established in the proenvironmental behaviour literature when examining peoples sense of moral obligation to perform environmentally friendly actions e g harland et al 1999 a review by thomas and sharp thomas and sharp 2013 noted that when a person believed important others were carrying out a particular proenvironmental behaviour e g recycling that individual was more encouraged to change their own behaviour than if they were simply exposed to a general social expectation to engage in recycling further the more visible the behaviour e g i see my neighbour recycling the greater the normalisation of that proenvironmental behaviour water use norms can be influenced by culture and traditions surrounding water sourcing and collection as well as normative observations of what is socially acceptable within a referent group allon and sofoulis 2006 this means that people will likely view some types of alternative water as suitable for domestic uses and other sources of water as totally unacceptable fielding et al 2015 nancarrow et al 2010 for example the direct reuse of wastewater amongst lower socioeconomic groups in developing countries is considered acceptable because it is an observable practice within that environment and the use of that water is a necessary means of survival sato et al 2013 united nations university institute for water 2013 in contrast if the same water reuse practices were suddenly applied in australia that behaviour may be met with a negative and potentially emotional response because it may violate traditions of water reuse prevalent in that context nancarrow et al 2008 therefore the domestic use of alternative water sources challenges existing perceptions of cleanliness and of cultural acceptability in some contexts acceptance may differ between different community groups and the different types of water qualities in question thus understanding normative influence is key to understanding acceptance of non traditional water sources in the water resource domain norms have been used to explain conservation behaviour and to develop strategies for demand management using the theory of planned behaviour e g fielding et al 2013 russell and fielding 2010 walton and hume 2011 however there has been little empirical examination of norms in the literature surrounding domestic use of alternative or non traditional urban water sources the limited research that has been conducted utilising social norms in explaining attitudes and intentions toward the consumption of alternative water sources has shown similar results to that of the general pro environmental behaviour research for example dolnicar and hurlimann 2009 examined social norms as an antecedent to intentions to drink recycled and desalinated water and found that important others evaluations of behaviour were key to explaining these intentions however as mankad and tapsuwan 2011 note there is often little examination of whether intentions actually translate into actual water reuse behaviours experimental research has also identified personal norms as robust predictors of acceptance of policy for the maintenance of domestic rainwater tanks a high sense of moral obligation that domestic tanks should be maintained was linked to greater acceptance of interventions that encouraged or monitored maintenance of the tanks walton and gardner 2014 a meta analysis of psychosocial determinants of proenvironmental behaviour including water conservation behaviour identified personal or moral norms as the third highest predictor of intention after attitude and behavioural control bamberg and möser 2007 1 2 attitudes and beliefs the psychological construct of attitude has been the focus of much research in the social and behavioural sciences arguably in the context of water reuse attitudes are pre existing dispositions that unconsciously guide whether an alternative water initiative is received well or is met with initial resistance attitudes are generally conceptualised as developing through an evaluative process comprising attribute dimensions such as good bad harmful beneficial and pleasant unpleasant ajzen 2001 ajzen and fishbein 2000 eagly and chaiken 1993 research further suggests that attitudes are not permanent but can change based on new information and experiences a new attitude can override an old one but may not replace it salient attitudes are retrieved based on the relevant context or as a habitual reaction to the attitude object wilson et al 2000 for example a person may be inherently opposed to using treated stormwater for potable uses old attitude however due to an extended period of drought in the region context the person may now be open to the idea of reusing stormwater new attitude because of the changed environmental context and threatened water supply new information it is important to distinguish attitudes from affect with attitudes requiring a cognitive evaluation of an object and affects describing general moods or specific emotions ajzen 2001 importantly attitudes can be jointly influenced by cognitive evaluations and affect some research further suggests that when cognitions and affect regarding an object hold different valences the influence of affect tends to dominate the attitude e g eagly and chaiken 1993 lavine et al 1998 within the psychology domain attitudes are conceptualised in various ways the most widely used approach is the value expectancy model which states that the evaluative meaning behind attitudes forms as we develop different beliefs about an object and assign subjective values to this information ajzen and fishbein 2000 while multiple belief attributes can influence an attitude only those beliefs that are most salient noticeable at any given time impact a relevant attitude beliefs that are regularly accessed provide the basis for relatively more stable attitudes ajzen 2001 however once again the context within which the attitudes are accessed can temporarily make certain beliefs more readily accessible and can influence a positive or negative valence ajzen et al 1999 similarly cialdini et al 1990 caution that although normative attitudes have the potential to guide behaviour within a society they are not rigid or uniform across all contexts and can only motivate and guide behaviour when elicited general attitudes towards alternative water sources can also develop based on past experiences with water e g an urban vs rural upbringing subjective or perceived knowledge about a water source and norms about water quality and propriety e g mankad and gardner 2016 perceptions of water consumption issues such as water wastage future water security and general environmental concern can also contribute to attitudes and beliefs about how water should be used and the acceptability of non traditional water alternatives a review by mankad and tapsuwan mankad and tapsuwan 2011 indicated that the most common attitude towards alternative water was tentative acceptance moderated by perceptions of health risk concern for water security confidence in water treatment technology and trust in water administrators to govern a new water source social influences such as water culture e g values placed on water by a community environmental concern and knowledge of water sourcing have also been found in the literature to influence social acceptance of alternative water mankad and tapsuwan 2011 water culture particularly in regions where water has traditionally been abundant or scarce such as in australia has a pervasive influence on how water might be used and planned for in daily activities in some instances water culture has a strong role in shaping national identity and citizens may pride themselves on the ways in which water plays a role in recreational activities or domestic habits fielding et al 2012 for example in regions where water is abundant recreational water play might be synonymous with tourism in that region in contrast arid regions may pride themselves on demand management or water reuse initiatives in place e g newater in singapore public utilities board 2018 such a focus on conservation can also be present amongst groups or individuals who identify themselves as environmentally aware and have a desire to manage their water use footprint further subjective preferences about water sourcing which might be influenced by perceived knowledge about a water source or personal experience with that source may lead some people to focus on reducing user demand of domestic water fielding et al 2012 individuals may also be influenced by beliefs that recycling or reusing treated water is needed to strengthen future water security public concern for water security has been demonstrated in past psychological research in the water domain e g see mankad and walton 2015 in particular research has shown that people living in urban areas are concerned about the availability of domestic water in the future as climatic events produce more extreme dry weather events and water restrictions become more commonplace dolnicar and hurlimann 2009 furthermore people have a clear preference for an apolitical approach to addressing water security issues as the issue will likely affect multiple generations and require a clear vision of how water will be sourced and used in a city of the future brown et al 2009 mankad and tucker 2013 mankad et al 2015 as brown et al 2007 and more recently mankad et al 2015 reported urban citizens generally believe that future water policies need to be developed in concert with sustainability leaders to produce workable solutions that will still be relevant in the years to come and not restricted by the institutional limitations of the present perceptions of water wastage are also quite salient within urban environments that have a history of water constraints and people often want to be seen as using water rather than wasting it kurz et al 2005 leonard et al 2015 mankad et al 2015 reported that when asked about stormwater urban residents saw the harvesting of stormwater as saving water that would otherwise be wasted down the drain participants also cited the reuse of stormwater as preferable to a process like desalination which took water from the ocean to create new water a prevailing attitude amongst the general population in modern times as extreme climate variability becomes the norm is that water is a socially valued resource interestingly research into rainwater tanks has identified that while this shared water value notion existed amongst the general population once an alternative water resource such as rainwater was available to households many people reported a strong sense of ownership towards the water on their property residents felt as though water were a personal commodity rather than a shared community resource farbotko et al 2014 gardiner 2009 this shift in perception is likely due to the personal financial commitments required to install a rainwater tank and maintain it it is interesting to note that greater personal investment in water infrastructure tends to reflect a greater sense of proprietorship over water whatever the beliefs that exist within a community it is clear that attitudes and norms encompassing both personal obligations and social pressures are key to understanding public acceptance of alternative water initiatives 1 3 present study the present study focuses on whether attitudinal evaluations of stormwater influence acceptance of stormwater treated and sourced through managed aquifer recharge mar specifically the role of psychological variables i e perceptions values norms in explaining stormwater acceptance is evaluated it is hoped that this research will establish the relevance of psychological constructs in explaining public acceptance of treated stormwater using managed aquifer recharge and determining whether the type of proposed stormwater use influences acceptance there are relatively few studies exploring community perspectives towards urban water reuse of stormwater and or managed aquifer recharge alexander 2010 mankad and walton 2015 wu et al 2012 in some urban centres the use of mar is more likely than the use of recycled water therefore this study will provide increased knowledge regarding community attitudes and views towards stormwater reuse this information can be useful in planning and implementing successful alternative water resources within an urban society based on past research discussed in earlier sections we hypothesise that people will be more accepting of non potable uses for treated stormwater and that psychological factors perceptions values and norms will be significant in explaining drivers of public acceptance 2 methods 2 1 participants participants were randomly recruited from an external database of south australian residents based on predetermined selection criteria i e required to be permanent residents of adelaide 18 years old or more those who chose to participate received a nominal reward opportunity prize draw entry used by the participant recruitment company the research team did not offer any additional incentives the sample n 408 comprised 43 females and 57 males ages ranged from 18 to 55 years 18 34 years 21 35 54 years 43 and 55 years and over 36 when compared to census data within the target region the sample was slightly over representative of females and people over the age of 55 than the general population abs 2011 a range of socioeconomic and education backgrounds were represented with the largest group of participants reporting household incomes of less than 60 000 42 and almost half of participants 44 completing some form of higher education bachelors or post graduate qualifications income and education levels were representative of the broader adelaide population adelaide city council 2015 australian bureau of statistics abs 2011 2 2 measures 2 2 1 experimental manipulation end use proposed water end use was operationalised as an experimental variable in this study participants were randomly assigned to one of two survey groups 1 drinking water or 2 non drinking water the drinking water or potable use condition was outlined as a proposed scenario where stormwater would be collected and treated such that it could then be mixed into the city s current water supply see fig 1 the water would then receive a final treatment along with the rest of the mains water supply and be distributed to homes and businesses via the existing centralised mains water network this option was framed as an equitable lower cost method using existing infrastructure the non potable or non drinking water condition proposed that stormwater would be collected and pre treated naturally in a wetland it would then be recharged into an underground aquifer and then distributed via a new separate third pipe network this separate network wouldn t be connected to the city s main drinking water supply these two scenarios were chosen to represent the simplest and most plausible ways that stormwater could be reused in this region for potable and non potable use 2 2 2 public acceptance of stormwater public acceptance of stormwater was measured using two items reflecting willingness to use treated stormwater and the extent to which individuals favoured using treated stormwater for drinking non drinking depending on the randomly assigned scenario eriksson et al 2006 response scales were 1 5 with lower numbers indicating lower acceptance r 4 0 6 0 83 2 2 3 descriptive and personal norms descriptive norms are attitudes concerning one s perception of how important others would support a particular behaviour such as potable and non potable uses of treated stormwater ajzen 2002 cialdini et al 1990 nolan et al 2008 four items were used e g i believe my family would support the use of treated stormwater for i believe my friends would support the use of treated stormwater for response scales used a 5 point likert scale 1 strongly disagree 5 strongly agree α 0 94 personal norms are distinct from descriptive norms and reflect internal values and expectations of one s own behaviour schwartz 1968 1977 personal norms create a sense of personal obligation to undertake a certain behaviour three items were used e g i would feel morally obliged to use treated stormwater for i would feel guilty if i didn t support the use of treated stormwater for adapted from previous research abrahamse et al 2009 bamberg and möser 2007 harland et al 1999 response scales used a 5 point likert scale 1 strongly disagree 5 strongly agree α 0 88 2 2 4 attitudes towards stormwater five attitude items were used to measure attitudes towards one of two different uses of treated stormwater presented as part of the experimental design the stem read i think that using treated stormwater for drinking non drinking would be bad good harmful beneficial worthless valuable unpleasant pleasant foolish wise ajzen 1991 response scales used a 5 point semantic differential scale e g 1 extremely bad 5 extremely good α 0 92 2 2 5 water security beliefs three items assessed perceptions of the city s water security and were developed from earlier qualitative research alexander 2010 mankad et al 2015 e g having a secure water supply is important in this city we as a community should think about the long term supply of water response scales used a 5 point likert scale 1 strongly disagree 5 strongly agree α 0 90 2 2 6 water wasting beliefs four items measured attitudes towards wasting water e g i think wasting water is bad and we as a community should cherish water adapted from previous research into frugality fujii 2006 response scales used a 5 point likert scale 1 strongly disagree 5 strongly agree α 0 83 2 2 7 water conservation culture a single item was included as a separate measure of australian water conservation culture conserving water is part of the australian lifestyle to assess perceptions of water in australia and the value placed on water by the community australia is a country that experiences regular water shortages necessitating domestic conservation of water therefore measuring the perception of water conservation culture was deemed important for this study 2 3 procedure surveys were conducted online and took approximately 15 min to complete the order of questions was randomised to control for order effects schuman et al 1981 participants were initially sent an email with an external survey link inviting them to participate in the survey they were provided with information about the study and indicated consent prior to commencing initial screening questions were used to ensure participants met the inclusion criteria of being a resident of adelaide 18 years and over and connected to the reticulated water supply participants were asked not to use any online search engines while they completed the survey so as not to influence their survey responses as per ethical procedures the surveys were anonymous and completed surveys were saved on an encrypted database the study was fully conducted in accordance with ethics approval from the human research ethics committee 2 4 data analysis all multi item measures were tested for reliability and separate scales developed for each variable using averages of the items within each scale independent samples t tests were used to compare means across the socio psychological variables for the two proposed end use scenarios potable and non potable multiple regression was used to predict the variance in public acceptance of stormwater taking into account the type of end use 3 results 3 1 descriptive analyses acceptance of stormwater on average there was strong support among respondents for non potable and potable use of treated stormwater see table 1 with only 3 of respondents not in favour of non potable reuse and 14 not in favour of potable reuse 3 2 differences between proposed uses potable and non potable independent samples t tests examined the significance in differences between scores for the two proposed end uses of treated stormwater non potable and potable for acceptance of stormwater and the six socio psychological variables descriptive norms personal norms attitudes water security beliefs waste beliefs and water conservation culture scores were significantly different for acceptance and for three of the socio psychological variables descriptive norms personal norms and attitudes see table 1 there were no statistically significant differences between recommended end uses for beliefs related to water security waste and water conservation culture between the two scenarios acceptance and overall attitudes towards stormwater were higher for those in the non potable reuse condition and ratings of descriptive and personal norms were also higher in the non potable reuse condition not surprisingly enduring beliefs about water security waste and a culture for conserving water were similar across both proposed use scenarios 3 3 predicting acceptance from end use and psychological variables a multiple regression was conducted to assess the extent to which acceptance for stormwater could be explained by end use and psychological factors using the total sample end use and the six psychological factors were entered into the regression table 2 summarises the descriptive statistics for mean scores and bivariate correlations between acceptance and the six psychological variables results showed that type of stormwater use and the psychological factors accounted for 79 of the variance in acceptance of stormwater r 2 0 79 adjusted r 2 0 79 f 7 400 218 070 p 001 end use and five of the six psychological variables were significant individual predictors of acceptance p 05 descriptive norms personal norms and attitudes towards stormwater were the most important predictors of acceptance water security beliefs water conservation culture and end use were statistically significant but weaker predictors water conservation culture was a negative predictor water wasting beliefs were non significant predictors of acceptance table 3 shows the standardised coefficients for each of the variables 4 discussion this study demonstrated that psychological factors explained a high proportion of variance in public acceptance of stormwater treated via managed aquifer recharge interestingly results also clearly showed that proposed end use of treated stormwater i e the way in which stormwater would be utilised drinking vs non drinking was a significant but considerably less influential factor in public acceptance the regression model showed that social pressure to behave in a way that would be supported by important others e g family and friends was the number one predictor of acceptance for stormwater reuse and that those norms would be an important factor in individuals decision to use treated stormwater this finding has important on ground implications with the suggestion that acceptance of alternative water could be facilitated if the reuse of stormwater were to be normalised in some way such as communicating or demonstrating that everyone is doing it dolnicar et al 2010 while the latter example may sound simplistic the type of framing used may elicit positive social pressures that lead to more expedient outcomes such as community acceptance driven by individual need to behave consistently with what important others are doing steg and vlek 2009 at a fundamental level the results suggest that participants were using cognitive shortcuts when forming opinions about stormwater reuse that is individuals were typically relying on their beliefs about what important others would do as a mental substitute for their own judgement on whether stormwater reuse was acceptable or not this suggestion is supported by other research in public acceptance of alternative water infrastructure for example ishii and boyer ishii and boyer 2016 demonstrated the effect of subjective descriptive norms in their study of acceptance for urine separating toilets for water conservation they found the majority of respondents perceived broader community support for urine separation infrastructure and this was positively related to the likelihood that one perceived urine source separation as a good idea a proxy such as this is often utilised in decision making situations where individuals have low knowledge or high uncertainty zeelenberg et al 2008 given the novelty of the stormwater application presented in this study participants were likely insufficiently familiar with the topic to make their own decisions about stormwater use an applied focus on normalising the use of alternative water sources can be a valuable strategy in future messaging around novel water technologies nolan et al 2008 targeting social and cultural norms provides opportunities for people to observe what others are doing and how stormwater is being used for its intended purpose e g potable or non potable this type of observational knowledge can also help to increase perceptions that the use of stormwater is a widely accepted behaviour nolan et al 2008 argue that the persuasive impact of normative social influence is effective in changing behaviour their research examined energy conservation and found that descriptive normative beliefs were better at predicting behaviour than more context specific attitudes and beliefs nolan and colleagues findings mirror those from the present study where social norms were stronger predictors in the acceptance model than attitudes towards stormwater the second strongest predictor in our model was personal norms which were almost as important as descriptive norms personal norms were defined as intrinsic expectations for one s own behaviour based on personal values of right and wrong as well as feelings of moral obligation participants in this study relied on feelings of personal and social obligation to determine their acceptance for treated stormwater as a potable or non potable water source feelings of guilt and a moral duty to supplement existing water supplies with a treated usable source of alternative water influenced participants to accept recharged stormwater as a potential urban water source drawing on the review by thomas and sharp 2013 the joint influence of descriptive and personal norms in predicting acceptance in this study was likely due to the combining influence of these two normative drivers not only did people believe that important others would accept stormwater reuse but also they themselves believed it was a social and moral expectation to reuse treated stormwater which likely contributed to a stronger overall effect this finding ties in with the less dominant but still significant influence of the two water related beliefs of water security and water conservation culture while each individual predictor had a small overall influence in the model the net result illustrates that there was a clear cognitive association between personal expectations for behaviour driven by moral obligation personal norms and personal beliefs around socially responsible water use linked to feelings of duty and responsibility to secure local water supplies for the future these feelings may also be linked to the traditional culture amongst australians where water is viewed as a precious and unpredictable resource mankad and gardner 2016 counter to what would be expected a personal attitude towards wasting water was not a significant predictor of acceptance for using stormwater for non potable or potable uses via managed aquifer recharge one explanation for this could be that the measures used did not adequately reflect the notion that capturing stormwater was an opportunity for avoiding the waste of water that would otherwise be lost which was described in previous qualitative research on stormwater mankad et al 2015 rather the measures used in the present study were broad dispositional measures about waste future research could explore ways to measure the concept of waste in relation to different water technologies and how they are linked to social norms and broader cultural values around natural resource use interestingly water conservation culture was found to be a negative predictor of stormwater acceptance that is the stronger the belief that conserving water was part of the australian lifestyle the lower the acceptance for treated stormwater as a potable or non potable source this finding arguably speaks to a much broader cultural issue around water use as suggested earlier traditionally life in australia was characterised by one of restraint and hardiness because of the sometimes harsh climatic conditions experienced in rural and remote australia mankad et al 2010 thus a culture of self sufficiency developed amongst citizens and australians began to identify themselves as successfully able to thrive in times of water abundance and drought simply by learning to modifying their water demand management behaviours allon and sofoulis 2006 this belief in self discipline to simply use less when environmental conditions required particularly amongst a sample from one of the most water stressed regions in australia may explain the surprisingly negative relationship between acceptance of mar and a belief that the australian lifestyle was characterised by a water conservation culture this model may suggest then that people who believe that conserving water is simply part of the australian lifestyle tend not to support initiatives to increase water availability rather they are more likely to support initiatives that encourage the conservation of water use as key to managing water supplies thus they may also be less likely to support funding directed towards supplementing existing water supplies with alternative choices in this study the way in which attitudes towards stormwater were presented and evaluated drinking vs non drinking meant that people were presented with two extreme characteristics of stormwater which allowed them to evaluate simplified costs and benefits of managed aquifer recharge of stormwater these attitudinal assessments of these options were value driven in that the results provide insight into underlying beliefs about how beneficial or agreeable treated stormwater might be to them and whether the use of treated stormwater is a safe and advantageous course of action to take as with all previous social research canvassing public acceptance of alternative water sources participants in this study were more likely to accept the use of treated stormwater if it were proposed for non potable end uses a less risky option that poortvliet et al 2018 suggest can result in more favourable evaluation by the public however the predictive influence of end use type was superseded in the regression model by the influence of social norms and water values for treatment options that are relatively new and thus unfamiliar people may not be able to generate strong opinions about them and so retreat to a position of relative safety therefore it is unsurprising that participants were more influenced by their social environment and cultural context when deciding whether treated stormwater was acceptable poortvliet et al 2018 in addition acceptance of potential changes that would impact everyone in a community rather than selected individuals would be expected to be more strongly driven by normative influences than by attitudes since normative influences reflect perceptions of a more community level view while water security beliefs were not dominant in predicting stormwater acceptance on their own the high average scores across the sample suggests that securing water for the future matters a great deal to this community further this belief is linked to acceptance of stormwater as a supplement to existing water supplies if the introduction of managed aquifer recharge of stormwater were to be introduced and it were framed as a key means of securing the water supply in the region for the long term public acceptance for the initiative would be expected to be higher regardless of whether it was proposed as a non potable or potable water source research on the influence of broader environmental values such as water security de groot and steg 2010 steg et al 2005 supports the notion that those who value particular environment benefits or outcomes are more likely to accept novel solutions that align with their values 5 conclusions the findings from this study articulate three main considerations for the future firstly plans to use treated stormwater need to consider public attitudes and norms that exist within the community in which the novel resource will be implemented importantly attitudes and norms relevant to the stormwater context will be important drivers of acceptance and could potentially be applied to messaging about the new technology secondly if the community shows a strong preference for supporting the conservation of water it may be more difficult to gain public acceptance for the development of alternative water sources that involve new or unfamiliar technologies if residents in a particular area believe that everybody just needs to be more careful with the water we have then there may be reduced motivation to accept a novel technology such as managed aquifer recharge for managing water resources even if it is to augment supply it would be valuable for future research to explore this issue and determine whether initiatives that propose more water versus those that propose more efficient use of water differ in their level of normative influence moreover solutions that both safeguard the future security of water for a growing population in combination with preserving a conservation culture toward water use could be explored in this instance additional resources may be needed to engage with people to explain that in conditions of extreme scarcity conservation measures may not be sufficient to address shortages future research could also examine more specific cost benefit influences on acceptance and decision making around stormwater reuse where approximate infrastructure costs could be articulated more accurately and used as a predictor of acceptance this future work would test the relative influence of values and norms in the context of infrastructure costs which may provide a mediating influence on acceptance finally it is clear that public acceptance of stormwater is not simply determined by the type of end use rather people s level of acceptance is developed through complex socially driven assessment based on cultural and community norms as well as individual beliefs and values about appropriate water use and conservation declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing
