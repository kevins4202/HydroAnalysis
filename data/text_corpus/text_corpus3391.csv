16955,biofiltration historically used for biodegradable organic matter bom removal in drinking water treatment is being increasingly applied for potable reuse which requires unique characterization this review and meta analysis evaluates bom occurrence as part of bulk wastewater effluent organic matter efom quantifies the roles of operational parameters to achieve efom removal in biofilters and identifies research gaps which may be fruitful for understanding reuse biofilter performance literature data n 76 indicates efom has a high biodegradable fraction median 26 which after typical ozone doses is higher 57 a biofiltration performance dataset n 160 across 42 wwtp effluents shows that efom removal of 35 40 can be expected when design parameters are optimized specifically higher efom removal is achieved by adding pre ozonation and use of biological activated carbon bac media with comparatively smaller impacts of increasing ozone dose or increasing empty bed contact time under typical scenarios combined these factors strongly correlate with observed efom removal r 2 0 64 after accounting for confounding by adsorptive removal in bac media with fewer than 20 000 bed volumes treated future research that quantifies the occurrence of bom biomass activity on filter media steady state removal by bac and impacts of longer empty bed contact times in potable reuse scenarios

discharge on receiving waterbodies or augment drinking water supplies through potable reuse rapid rate biologically active granular media filtration biofiltration is well established especially in europe for removal of organic matter and contaminants in drinking water treatment terry and summers 2018 and is becoming widespread in advanced systems to treat wastewater effluents wwefs gerrity et al 2013 organic matter om in wastewater effluent includes both specific compounds e g pesticides pharmaceuticals personal care products ozonation byproducts and non specific bulk effluent organic matter efom a fraction of which is biodegradable om bom shon et al 2006 bulk efom represents the primary substrate for aerobic heterotrophic growth in biofilters its removal improves water quality directly by removing disinfection byproduct dbp precursors michael kordatou et al 2015 and decreasing microbial growth potential in distribution systems weinrich et al 2010 and also indirectly by providing the carbon source needed for metabolism of specific contaminants which occur at trace i e secondary substrate concentrations zearley and summers 2012 in potable reuse removal of bulk efom is also a specific design parameter because total organic carbon toc concentrations in common wastewater effluents 6 9 mg l krasner et al 2009 exceed typical regulatory limits e g 0 5 3 mg l u s environmental protection agency 2012 california department of public health 2018 florida potable reuse commission 2020 a range of treatment technologies can be utilized to remove efom including reverse osmosis and activated carbon adsorption however biofiltration is a comparatively lower cost lower energy usage approach which is attractive for strategies seeking to optimize performance and target water quality that is fit for purpose gerrity et al 2014 schimmoller and kealy 2014 removal of bulk efom with biofiltration has been reported in a growing body of studies which collectively comprise different source waters pretreatments and operating conditions however biofilter performance across these factors has not been well characterized most studies are logistically constrained to one or two source waters and only a few operational conditions thus effects of water quality or biofilter operation can be site specific and difficult to generalize such generalization is needed to reconcile the wide range of biofilter performance observed across and within studies for example peered reviewed studies reporting biofilter performance as toc or dissolved organic carbon doc removal include 3 15 ho et al 2011 6 30 arnold et al 2018 17 37 kalkan et al 2011 23 51 farr√© et al 2011 22 63 reungoat et al 2011 and 59 76 chuang and mitch 2017 in these and other studies efom removal not only exceeds the average bom removal achieved in drinking water rapid rate biofilters i e 10 toc removal without ozone and 15 removal after ozone but also the average total bom fraction itself 20 and 30 terry and summers 2018 and thus reuse biofilters require unique characterization the study goal was to quantitatively assess biofiltration performance for efom removal on a wide range of source waters and operational conditions to provide insight on the resulting wide ranges in efom removal reuse biofilters treating municipal wastewater effluent are implemented using principles established for drinking water given that the ratio of efom to drinking water dom is only 2 to 5 and that many drinking water sources are impacted by wastewater discharges thus this analysis is focused on treatment of wastewater effluents through the lens of well established drinking water biofiltration urfer et al 1997 zhu et al 2010 basu et al 2016 brown et al 2016 terry and summers 2018 briefly biofilter performance is related to the amount and character of influent bom and the amount and activity of filter biomass though in practice rather inexact but more easily defined surrogates are used bom is usually quantified as either biodegradable doc bdoc a measure of the total or ultimate biodegradable fraction defined as the change in doc after long term exposure to biomass or assimilable organic carbon aoc a measure of readily biodegradable om defined as the growth of specific microbial species relative to their growth on a reference substrate escobar and randall 2001 ozone pre oxidation reacts with recalcitrant om to increase the bom fraction huck 1990 biofilter performance is impacted by influent water quality conditions type and amount of bom and water temperature which affect microbial activity and operating conditions empty bed contact time ebct and media type which affect the amount of biomass use of granular activated carbon gac media is beneficial but complicates the steady state biofilter performance assessment as it may hold residual adsorption capacity psuedo first order kinetic steady state behavior based on plug flow hydraulics is a simplified but useful model of biofilter performance in this approach once acclimated and at steady state bom removal is modeled to be independent of influent bom concentration and thus can be reported on a relative percent removal basis terry and summers 2018 the specific objective was to address the following questions what level of efom removal can be expected with biofiltration and what are the contributions of operating conditions the approach taken was to first review the occurrence of bom in wastewater treatment plant effluents both with and without pre ozonation to establish a treatability baseline second a biofiltration performance database of efom removal paired to system operating parameters was complied the impacts of ozone dose ebct and media type were then evaluated in three ways 1 critical review of studies which report the impact of each parameter with paired data 2 systematic evaluation of biofiltration performance in an internal six wwef lab study and 3 meta analysis of data across all studies the role of non steady state adsorptive processes when using biological activated carbon bac media is addressed finally a descriptive model is used to evaluate the combined effects of the treatment parameters on efom removal across all source waters in the meta analysis dataset and recommendations for future research are presented 2 methods 2 1 external data collection and screening criteria three databases were developed to address the specific objectives both peer reviewed and gray literature e g conference proceedings dissertations utility reports were investigated the first database assessed bom occurrence in wwefs n 76 from 12 studies table si 4 1 the second database assessed the transition from gac a condition in which dom removal is dominated by gac adsorption to bac a condition in which dom removal is dominated by biodegradation of bom n 50 from 21 studies table si 5 1 the most extensive database was developed from studies that reported bom removal from efom by biofiltration and the associated biofilter operating parameters n 286 forty two studies on biofiltration of municipal wastewater efom that reported all of the following criteria were retained in this database 1 biofilter influent toc or doc concentration 2 bom removal reported as absolute or percent change in toc or doc concentration 3 ozone dose or specific ozone dose o3 toc mg mg 4 ebct 5 granular media type either inert typically sand or anthracite or bac and 6 for bac media the throughput in bed volumes treated before sampling studies using bac media for which prior throughput was unknown were also included if the media had been in use at field scale for at least 2 years i e about 35 000 bed volumes at 30 min ebct other parameters were considered as eligibility criteria including temperature the biodegradable efom fraction bdoc or aoc and biomass quantification but not used because they were not frequently reported it is common to locate additional pre treatment processes between the wwtp secondary process and the biofilter and in most cases results from these studies were included in the analysis examples of these pretreatments include tertiary filtration rapid sand or cartridge coagulation and ozonation when significant pretreatment was reported e g ozonation at high dose and not immediately preceding biofiltration ion exchange for dom removal those results were excluded 2 2 internal wwef treatability study in addition to the external data biofiltration results generated by the authors as part of a larger study to evaluate dbp control in wwefs by coagulation ozonation biofiltration and gac adsorption were included summers et al 2020 one motivation for including the data in this review was inert media was used while most published wwef studies 88 used bac media the laboratory study evaluated six different wwefs for bdoc table si 2 2 and biofiltration performance with inert anthracite media specific ozone doses of 0 and 1 0 o3 toc mg mg and ebcts of 5 15 and 30 min table si 2 1 the ozonation biofiltration and analytical methods were reported previously summers et al 2020 the toc removal data from this study n 36 was compared to the literature data for inert media alone n 29 and no evidence was found to suggest that the laboratory data would introduced bias in interpreting the literature dataset a detailed description of this analysis is in si section 3 2 3 data pre processing the initial biofilter performance dataset contained 286 observations of efom removal by biofiltration across 42 unique wwtp effluents from 43 studies unique wwtps were identified by name or by a combination of location and treatment process description some studies evaluated multiple wwtps and some wwtps were evaluated in multiple studies data were grouped by wwtp rather than by study to isolate variations in treatability by water quality rather than research publication the median number of observations per wwtp was 3 with a maximum of 86 to avoid over leveraging wwtps with more available data a preprocessing step was used to consolidate the data for each wwtp effluent by binning across similar operating parameters the following bins were used o3 toc mg mg 0 0 to 0 6 0 6 to 0 9 0 9 to 1 2 1 2 ebct min 0 to 8 8 to 16 16 to 24 24 to 32 32 media type inert bac for each wwtp effluent bin combination the average of each inclusion criteria i e toc removal o3 toc ebct and bac throughput were retained as single estimators for that bin the resulting biofiltration performance dataset n 160 was used for further evaluation studies which systematically evaluated different operating conditions are summarized in table 1 and the full dataset is available in table si 1 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 biofiltration dataset descriptive statistics the distributions of biofilter influent efom toc concentrations and treatment operating parameters o3 toc ebct and bac throughput in the initial dataset are shown in fig 1 we evaluated each distribution and determined that the dataset is a good representation of typical field scale conditions as follows the toc median concentration 7 5 mg l and interquartile range iqr 6 3 to 9 6 mg l are representative of typical wwtp effluents for example these values are consistent with surveyed wwtps n 38 that practice nitrification krasner et al 2009 the median specific ozone dose 0 8 mg o3 mg toc and iqr 0 6 to 1 0 coincide with doses typically used to achieve multiple ozonation objectives in potable reuse including disinfection and trace organic contaminant mitigation while balancing formation of negative byproducts and cost gerrity et al 2012 2014 lee et al 2013 in 35 cases 41 ozone was not utilized figure si 1 1 the median ebct of 15 min iqr 10 to 30 min is consistent to the median ebct of 18 min in the full scale facilities n 9 in the dataset for bac media the throughput in number of bed volumes treated prior to sampling had a wide and distributed range from below 2000 bed volumes to higher than 100 000 not shown in fig 1 are throughput values above 60 000 bed volumes n 16 which represents bac media from full scale filters which had been in use for multiple years i e 2 years at the median 17 min ebct the impact of residual adsorption at low throughput values was separately evaluated section 3 3 3 2 biodegradable efom occurrence and removal dissolved organic matter in both wwef and dw source waters consists of a range of heterogeneous compounds that have a distribution of biodegradable behavior a biodegradable fraction and a recalcitrant fraction are operationally defined based on laboratory tests the biodegradable fraction represents a continuum with some compounds being readily consumed often term rapid fast or easily biodegradable and others being more recalcitrant but ultimately biodegradable given time and the method of characterization two measures of the biodegradable fraction aoc and bdoc commonly applied to natural waters and for treatment and distribution of conventional drinking water have also been applied to wwef servais et al 1987 khan et al 1998b weinrich et al 2009 3 2 1 occurrence of biodegradable efom without ozone secondary treatment biological at the wwtp does not achieve complete bom removal in a survey of 21 wwtp effluents an average biodegradable efom fraction bdoc doc of 23 and a range of 4 41 were reported weinrich et al 2010 a similarly wide range of results were found across other surveys range 3 66 n 17 krasner et al 2009 range 9 33 n 13 khan et al 1998a range 23 35 n 8 babcock et al 2001 and range 33 44 n 6 from the internal six wwef study si table 2 2 the results from these and other studies are summarized in si table 4 1 and taking all data together results in a median bdoc doc of 26 interquartile range 18 34 and a minimum and maximum of 3 and 70 respectively si fig 4 1 lower effluent bdoc and toc have been associated with wwtps that provide higher levels of biological treatment either based on longer solids retention time khan et al 1998a or level of nitrification denitrification achieved krasner et al 2009 however in this dataset there is no significant correlation between effluent toc and the biodegradable fraction when toc is above 3 mg l p 0 25 r2 0 02 si fig 4 3 which indicates that wwtp effluent toc concentration may not be a reliable surrogate for its biodegradability the type of wwtp treatment process has also been associated with different levels of bdoc with attached growth processes i e trickling filters having higher bdoc doc 35 on average weinrich et al 2010 and up to 70 cha et al 2004 while mbr effluents commonly have low bdoc doc about 10 15 krasner et al 2009 weinrich et al 2010 lee et al 2012 figure si 4 1 however the extent to which these differences result from inherent effects of the treatment processes or other variables has not been well defined weinrich et al 2010 in their survey n 21 found a median aoc bdoc of 50 iqr 35 68 indicating that the typical biodegradable fraction of wwef is relatively balanced between readily assimilable compounds and more recalcitrant but ultimately biodegradable constituents 3 2 2 occurrence of biodegradable efom after ozone ozone is widely acknowledged to substantially increase the biodegradability of dom as such biofiltration is often placed downstream of an ozonation process gerrity et al 2013 ozone reacts quickly with unsaturated bonds in dom breaking aromatic rings and forming oxygenated low molecular weight byproducts including carboxylic acids aldehydes and ketones von gunten 2003 ozonation byproducts are themselves ozone resistant and accumulate with increasing ozone dose thus ozonation largely transforms but does not mineralize dom von gunten 2003 in the absence of nitrite or other reduced inorganics ozone decomposition and exposure is directly controlled by reactions between ozone and efom buffle et al 2006 the specific ozone dose o3 toc mg mg units used throughout is often used to normalize ozone dose and exposure reported as the nitrite adjusted dose to isolate reactions with organics despite variations in efom composition across different wastewater effluents strong relationships have been reported between o3 toc and ozone exposure buffle et al 2006 and change in uv absorbance wert et al 2009 arnold et al 2018 which support this approach despite wide evaluation of ozone reactivity with dissolved compounds relatively few studies have quantified the effect of ozone dose on changes in the biodegradable fraction of efom si figure 4 2 lee et al 2012 systematically evaluated the change in bdoc resulting from specific ozone doses in the 0 3 to 3 0 range on an mbr effluent toc 3 7 mg l ozonation caused a substantial increase in bdoc doc from about 14 with no ozonation up to 45 at o3 toc of 1 0 and a maximum of 61 at o3 toc of about 2 0 the change in bdoc was approximately linear in the o3 toc range of 0 to 1 with decreasing bdoc yield at higher doses li et al 2006 found that an o3 toc dose of about 1 0 increased the bdoc doc from about 25 to 60 and in the internal six wwef study it increased from an average of 40 to 62 n 6 table si 2 1 while other studies report smaller effects after ozonation at similar doses amy et al 1996 wang et al 2008 on an aoc basis wert et al 2007 observed an increase from 5 to 16 after ozonation of a wwtp effluent practicing tertiary coagulation with the majority of the increase occurring below o3 toc of 0 5 in contrast li et al 2017 reported a higher aoc increase 31 from a secondary treated wwtp and with the majority of the increase occurring above o3 toc of 0 4 taken together efom ozonation at doses to achieve typical objectives o3 toc 0 6 to 1 0 described in section 3 1 can be expected to yield a substantial bom fraction measured either by bdoc or aoc across many types of biological processes used at wwtps an o3 toc of 1 0 yields a median bdoc toc of 59 which is 50 higher than without ozone on a paired basis 39 n 10 and more than double when compared to the dataset as a whole i e on an unpaired basis 26 n 61 however the small bdoc dataset for ozonated efom n 14 indicates that research is needed to better understand the dose response relationship between ozone and formation of bdoc and aoc in wastewater effluents understanding the total biodegradable fraction and development of more precise estimates of the biodegradable continuum is needed to properly evaluate biofilter performance and to account for the possibility of biofilm growth downstream in distribution systems or building premise plumbing as potable reuse becomes more widely adopted 3 2 3 removal of biodegradable efom during biofiltration incomplete bom removal is observed during biofiltration under normal ebcts 60 min bdoc removals of 30 lee et al 2012 60 li et al 2006 and 75 kalkan et al 2011 have been reported from efom in the internal six wwef study the average bdoc removal across the six wastewater effluents ranged from 10 no ozone 5 min ebct to 50 o3 toc 1 0 30 min ebct this range of bdoc removal is similar to that seen during biofiltration of conventional drinking waters 25 80 juhna and melin 2006 similarly terry and summers 2018 in their meta analysis of drinking water biofilter performance found that median toc removal was about 50 of median bdoc for both ozonated and non ozonated waters given that only 8 of the literature treatment data found was expressed as bdoc or aoc the results herein will be expressed on a toc basis 3 3 determination of steady state bac biofilter performance the use of gac in biofilters has many benefits which include residual adsorption capacity for strongly adsorbing compounds and the ability to attenuate influent spikes of adsorbing compounds the transition of fresh gac into biological activated carbon bac consists of decreasing adsorptive removal that overlaps with the establishment of bio removal which makes characterization of biological performance difficult fig 2 in terry and summers 2018 the adsorption capacity utilization phase can last for several months and longer depending on filter size and the physiochemical properties of both the adsorbent and adsorbate for example slow adsorption of large molecular weight dom into gac micropores can take months peel and benedek 1983 summers and roberts 1987 sontheimer et al 1988 and more strongly adsorbing compounds can take months to years to deplete the adsorption capacity kennedy et al 2015 this overlaps with the bioacclimation phase both in the establishment of the type and concentration of biomass needed to metabolize bom which takes a few weeks to a few months wang et al 1995 greenstein et al 2018 sundaram et al 2020 and in the adaptation of the biomass to degrade more recalcitrant compounds which can take longer zearley and summers 2012 the transition to steady state bioremoval is asymptotic and dependent on water quality factors such as temperature and bom characteristics to best characterize long term bac performance the unsteady state contribution of adsorption should be minimized if the bac filter is not operated for enough time an over estimate of the long term bom removal will be made as such an estimate of the time or throughput needed to allow adsorption to become a small part of the overall bom removal is needed zachman and summers 2010 have systematically shown that adsorption capacity is higher for low dom concentration and ph smaller gac size and longer ebct in particular the run time throughput to a target effluent concentration is inversely proportional to the dom influent concentration we hypothesized that high toc removal observed in some studies with bac media might be explained in part by residual adsorption rather than biofiltration alone overstating steady state biofilter performance a literature review of full or pilot scale gac application to wwefs was conducted and the transition from gac adsorption to steady state ss toc bioremoval i e bac as a function of influent toc concentration was assessed for 26 gac runs fig 2a summarized in table si 5 1 other parameters known to impact steady state throughput e g temperature ph and gac type and size were not reported with enough frequency to quantify their impact the average steady state removal after gac transition to bac was 25 8 it is often difficult to establish the point at which steady state removal is achieved when sufficient data were available a slope of 0 3 change 1000 bed volumes was used as the steady state removal criterion however most studies were plagued by insufficient data at long run times and variations in the influent concentration or upstream operating conditions the relationship between influent toc and throughput to 80 breakthrough from the meta analysis of 26 gac runs reported by benstoem et al 2017 is also shown in fig 2a again other parameters known to impact gac performance were not reported throughput data from both the field studies evaluated at steady state average 25 removal and benstoem et al 2017 study at 80 breakthrough 20 removal were combined and the overall regression for these 52 data points is also shown in fig 2a while influent ph ebct and gac type and size are not modeled by this relationship it can serve as a guide for estimating the run length of a gac adsorber with coal based gac bituminous or lignite to the point at which adsorption is not a major factor in toc removal the relationship can be further estimated by the product of 90 000 to the inverse of the influent toc for lower ph 7 5 longer ebcts 15 min and smaller gac particle size 12 40 sieve longer run times would be expected before adsorptive toc removal is negligible thus new pilot studies that are only interested in long term bioremoval assessment and not evaluating gac to bac transition should consider using gac from other sites with similar water quality this media should be re acclimated to the new source water until a steady state removal is established the effect of throughput on bulk organic matter removal as toc for adsorptive media in the biofiltration performance dataset n 89 is shown in fig 2b using a bin width of 10 000 bed volumes only steady state operation data either as defined by the authors of these studies or as determined in this review by analysis of the endpoints of the toc breakthrough curves when available are shown in fig 2b under steady state conditions average toc removal is independent of throughput however in the dataset the median toc removal for biofilters with less than 10 000 bed volumes treated was nearly four fold higher than for those with greater than 40 000 bed volumes treated 70 and 18 respectively compared to 40 000 bed volumes toc removal was higher for 0 10 000 p 0 001 and 10 000 20 000 bed volumes p 0 001 but was not significantly different for bins above 20 000 bed volumes p 0 3 anova and tukey s hsd additionally the relative throughput defined as the ratio of throughput achieved to predicted throughput required for reaching steady state fig 2a was calculated for the dataset a relative throughput of 1 0 or greater indicates that sufficient bed volumes were treated to reach steady state based on influent toc assuming the organic matter exhibits average treatability for throughput below 20 000 bed volumes median toc removal when relative throughput was 1 0 or above 26 was lower than for relative throughput below 1 0 68 while for throughput above 20 000 bed volumes median toc removal 20 was independent of relative throughput figure si 5 1 in combination higher toc removal was associated with adsorptive media biofilters which were evaluated at low throughput less than 20 000 bed volumes and for which influent toc was low relative throughput less than 1 indicating non steady state behavior even when all biofilters were reported to be operating at steady state to account for the significant effect of throughput on toc removal in this meta analysis data for adsorptive media filters were re classified as bac when throughput exceeded 20 000 bed volumes or when relative throughput was 1 0 or higher and as gac when neither threshold was achieved of 89 data points 40 were classified as gac indicating that a large portion of the dataset represents biofilters for which adsorptive processes could be expected fig 2c toc removal with gac media was 29 percentage points higher on average compared to bac media even when accounting for effects of ebct and o3 toc ancova p 0 001 as a result data for gac media are excluded from further discussion and the meta analysis 3 4 effects of biofilter operating parameters on wwef toc removal the effects of ozone ebct and media type on toc removal are shown in fig 3 using bins to illustrate the dataset as a whole i e on an unpaired basis for each bin no systematic differences in the prevalence of the other parameters were found thus the effects of ozone ebct media type and water temperature are reviewed individually in this section analysis of the operating parameters all together with ozone dose and ebct taken as continuous variables will follow in section 3 5 3 4 1 ozone and ozone dose for the dataset as a whole biofiltration without pre ozonation n 44 yielded a median toc removal of 13 fig 3 and with pre ozonation which increases the bom fraction the toc removal increased to 21 n 73 higher toc removal after pre ozonation is also reported in studies with paired data and the magnitude of the difference is often higher than indicated in the whole dataset these paired data cover a wide range of wwtps and biofilter operating parameters summarized in table si 6 2 most commonly toc removal was 10 20 percentage points p p higher for biofilters after ozonation o3 toc 0 5 1 1 compared to no ozonation olivier 2001 farr√© et al 2011 gifford et al 2018 and the internal six wwef study yielded 7 18 p p higher removal after ozonation at o3 toc 1 0 table si 2 1 the difference in toc removal ranged from as high as 30 p p bacaro et al 2019 to as low as 4 p p bourgin et al 2018 the impact of different ozone doses however is more varied gifford et al 2018 fit linear relationships between ozone dose and toc removal across o3 toc of 0 3 1 2 for bac and anthracite media on an mbr effluent the fitted slopes were 1 2 1 4 p p higher toc removal per 0 1 o3 toc dose increase indicating that large changes in o3 toc were required to achieve substantially higher toc removal similarly lee et al 2012 observed a 9 p p increase in toc removal when o3 toc was increased from 0 5 to 1 0 though the toc removal was much smaller than the increase in o3 derived bdoc i e bdoc toc of 54 compared to 14 without ozone which may be the result of media type anthracite or ebct 20 min applying even higher ozone doses o3 toc 2 0 vs 1 0 can further improve toc removal by about 5 10 p p but the marginal benefit is lower lee et al 2012 arnold et al 2018 in contrast some studies report no substantial increase in toc removal with increasing ozone dose across o3 toc 0 35 1 chuang and mitch 2017 or 1 0 2 0 sundaram et al 2020 zhu et al 2015 reported small incremental improvements in dom removal on a cod basis across o3 toc 0 6 to 1 2 although removal reached about 10 p p higher on average at these endpoints the difference in means was smaller than the standard deviations overall pre ozonation improves biofilter performance but only modest gains can be expected at incrementally higher ozone doses e g from 0 8 to 1 0 bigger performance gains are expected with much larger ozone doses but because of higher cost and challenges with bromate formation ozone dose will likely be determined by other treatment objectives in a potable reuse scenario such as disinfection 3 4 2 empty bed contact time longer ebcts can increase dom removal as more exposure to biomass is provided wang et al 1995 for the whole dataset increasing the ebct from below 8 min n 28 to 8 to 16 min n 44 increased the median toc removal from 10 to 17 fig 3 incremental dom removal decreases at longer ebcts as the more easily biodegradable substrate is preferentially removed in the upper filter leaving only more recalcitrant compounds in the lower filter zearley and summers 2012 in drinking water treatment toc removal typically begins to plateau at ebcts in the range of 5 to 15 min terry and summers 2018 however as shown in fig 3 no plateau in median efom removal is evident up through 30 min ebct this is consistent with higher overall bdoc in wwefs compared to typical drinking waters section 3 1 and suggests that a substantial portion of the bdoc is relatively recalcitrant requiring longer ebcts for removal biofilters treating wwef typically have utilized longer ebcts median 18 min in the nine full scale facilities in the dataset than those utilized in conventional drinking water biofilters median 7 min brown et al 2016 in the most extensively investigated source water with paired data an mbr pilot plant using both anthracite and 5 year old bac maximum toc removal was typically achieved at or below 10 min ebct gifford et al 2018 bacaro et al 2019 the exception was after high ozone dose o3 toc 2 3 where toc removal increased by 6 p p when ebct was increased from 10 min to 20 min arnold et al 2018 in contrast in the internal six wwef study using anthracite media across six non mbr wwtps higher toc removal was consistently observed with increasing ebct in each water both from ebct 5 to 15 min and from 15 to 30 min and both with and without ozone table si 2 1 in these waters increasing ebct from 5 to 15 min after pre ozonation improved toc removal by an average of 10 p p and increasing ebct to 30 min improved toc removal by an additional 10 p p other studies which evaluated the effect of ebct have used bac media which started as fresh gac table si 6 3 in these studies extending ebct to longer than 20 min improved toc removal by up to 8 p p olivier 2001 12 p p gerrity et al 2011 and 23 p p farr√© et al 2011 compared to performance below 20 min kalkan et al 2011 investigated two types of bac media in parallel and reported a similar increase in toc removal for a thermally activated carbon 7 p p ebct 9 to 18 min but no increase in toc removal for a chemically activated carbon a challenge with interpreting bac results even with paired data is that each ebct has achieved a different throughput therefore the role of ebct can be confounded with the role of residual adsorption as an example a gac to bac filter operated for 9 months will have treated about 80 000 bvs at 5 min ebct but just 13 000 bvs at 30 min it could be expected that the biomass profile throughout the filter has reached steady state and that minimal adsorption capacity remains in the upper filter but the lower filter remains squarely in the adsorption mass transfer zone while the above referenced studies were screened for bac throughput to minimize adsorptive confounding section 3 3 it is not possible to isolate biological processes within the data itself the study by vaidya et al 2019 however reported 21 toc removal in a bac biofilter 5 min ebct and an additional 20 toc removal in a gac adsorber 10 min ebct which was operated to 40 000 bed volumes and exhibited pseudo steady state behavior this indicates that ebct played a major role in the 16 p p increase in toc removal at the total 15 min ebct compared to 5 min for bac media both the dataset as a whole and the paired data studies show that ebcts above 8 min normally provide meaningfully higher toc removal than lower ebcts in many cases extending ebct above 20 or 30 min can also have a significant benefit this supports the current practice of using longer ebcts than in conventional drinking water treatment and indicates that even longer ebcts could be useful in practice designers and operators must balance the increased cost and operational complexity of longer ebcts with potential negative impacts of a residual biodegradable efom being released to the subsurface or distribution system in potable reuse scenarios 3 4 3 media type as stated in section 3 3 gac is often used for biofilter media as it offers several advantages over inert media including better toc removal however the performance of biofilters that use gac as media can be substantially higher due to residual toc adsorption capacity when prior throughput and influent toc are low the bac data in fig 3 does not include that from biofilters with gac that did not meet the minimum throughput criteria 20 000 bv and the toc removal with bac media was still higher than inert media on average by 7 percentage points 15 vs 23 similarly paired studies that evaluated both inert and bac media also 20 000 bv under the same feed water and operational conditions i e ozone dose and ebct almost always report higher toc removal with bac media than inert media si table 6 1 the largest differences in toc removal were in the range of 21 27 percentage points higher in bac filters in two studies that use long ebcts 60 min and 40 min respectively farr√© et al 2011 reaume et al 2015 smaller increases in bom removal with bac were reported in the other studies ho et al 2011 observed 10 12 p p higher toc removal in bac under non ozonated conditions with the difference driven by very low toc removal in the inert media columns 3 5 in several studies with mbr pilot plant effluent the toc removal ranged from 6 to 40 and the bac filter consistently outperformed the parallel anthracite filter by 1 12 p p median 5 5 p p arnold et al 2018 gifford et al 2018 bacaro et al 2019 hooper et al 2020 found a 7 percentage point effect for bac compared to anthracite at low temperatures 12 15 oc despite a shorter ebct 7 5 min vs 12 min in contrast zhu et al 2015 reported no significant difference between anthracite and bac on a cod basis and bourgin et al 2018 observed slightly higher toc removal in a full scale sand filter compared to a pilot scale bac filter 20 vs 18 and despite the bac filter having a longer ebct 18 min vs 10 min in these paired studies the advantage of bac over inert media biofilters was greatest for systems that started with onsite gac and ran the filters long enough 20 000 bv to yield bac compared to studies that sampled used gac from an offsite full scale facility or previous studies in the latter case in which the risk of residual non steady state adsorption is less likely performance with bac media ranged from about 10 percentage points better to no substantial effect in total there is strong evidence that bac media can be expected to outperform inert media even when controlling for residual non steady state adsorptive capacity however very large differences may indicate non steady state behavior in the bac which should be closely evaluated 3 4 4 temperature water temperature affects microbial activity and can significantly affect the kinetics of bom removal in biofilters for example in drinking water treatment achieving 50 bdoc removal requires a 14 min ebct on average for temperatures below 10 oc while only 4 min ebct is required for temperatures above 20 oc terry and summers 2018 the effects of temperature on kinetics of efom removal however have been largely neglected in the dataset only 17 of 43 studies reported water temperature data during their evaluation of biofiltration thirteen of these studies evaluated a single temperature each within the narrow range of 22 25 oc and the others reported a wider temperature range e g 13 28 oc across their testing but did not isolate the role of temperature on biofilter performance thus the impact of temperature on efom removal specifically any important deviations from that seen during conventional drinking water biofiltration remains unknown 3 5 regression evaluation of biofiltration performance the combined impacts of ozone dose ebct and media type on biofilter performance were evaluated with a linear regression this descriptive model approach was used in order to estimate the relative contributions of each operating parameter on observed efom removal and to identify the variance associated with these controllable factors the model space was defined as ebct 5 30 min o3 toc 0 1 2 and toc removal 0 which encapsulates the majority of the dataset n 98 out of 118 data outside the model space plus one high leverage value were removed as outliers the regression model results are shown in table 2 with simulated toc removal represented by the standardized regression coefficient Œ≤ and visualized in fig 4 a with isoremoval lines as a function of o3 toc and ebct for each media type the regression intercept represents the simulated toc removal when all parameters are at the dataset average ¬µ and remaining coefficients represent the change in simulated toc removal when the operating parameter is changed by one standard deviation œÉ2 the toc removal simulation range 5 32 matches the observed 5th and 95th percentiles in the dataset 3 31 and each main effect correlated strongly with toc removal p 0 001 toc removal with bac media was substantially higher than for inert media 8 7 percentage points on average after controlling for adsorption which supports the use of bac media in reuse biofilters ozone dose affected toc removal by 1 2 p p per 0 1 change in specific dose similar to that found by gifford et al 2018 for one feed water avg 1 3 p p per 0 1 change in specific dose for both ozone dose and ebct i e 1 p p per 2 2 min change in ebct relatively large operational changes are required to expect meaningful impact on toc removal additionally strong evidence was found of a positive interactive effect between ebct and o3 toc p 0 011 this suggests that longer ebct may be more effective when more bom is formed at higher ozone doses however the actual effect size Œ≤ 1 4 was relatively small such an interactive effect was observed experimentally by gifford et al 2018 where increasing ozone dose also required a longer ebct to maximize toc removal weaker evidence was found for a positive interactive effect between bac media and longer ebct Œ≤ 2 0 p 0 18 applying these interactive effects is difficult because relatively few data exist for high o3 toc or for bac media with high ebct this analysis suggests that future research in these areas is warranted the meta analysis multiple linear regression was statistically significant p 2e 16 and provides good correlation adj r 2 0 64 considering the scope and context of this analysis i e evaluating three operational parameters for total not biodegradable organic carbon removal across a diverse range of studies incorporating more precise water quality parameters and standardization of biofiltration methods e g ensuring scalability mckie et al 2019 terry et al 2019 may help explain the remaining variance the regression presented here was judged to be an appropriate representation of the dataset based on residuals analysis figure si 7 1 and though transformed and non linear model forms were also considered none presented a better fit to the data future research is needed to more completely describe biofilter performance at higher ozone doses and ebcts and the least squares average toc removal presented here should not be extrapolated beyond the model space the distribution of the regression model residuals gives insight into expected performance variations that can benchmark future research and implementation of reuse biofilters fig 4b the residuals interquartile range was 3 5 percentage points i e half of the data was within this range indicating that operational parameters alone yield a suitably precise treatability estimate on average to be useful for preliminary design and for designing bench and pilot scale studies for many wwtp effluents further the standard deviation of the residuals 5 6 percentage points indicates the likelihood of biofilter performance which diverges from the average for example toc removal outside of 11 p p 2 standard deviations of the regression relationship is statistically unlikely given the current dataset and observations of such outlier data should be closely studied as fundamental insights into good or bad biofilter performance could provide a large step forward for the field 4 conclusions recommendations and areas for future research a meta analysis was used to evaluate the effects of the operation parameters ozone dose ebct and media type on effluent organic matter removal by biofiltration each operating parameter had a significant impact on observed toc removal which were quantified with a regression model performance of bac media can be significantly influenced by run time throughput prior to data collection and the combination of slow adsorption and biodegradation combined with normal influent water quality perturbations makes it difficult to ascertain steady state behavior during transition from gac adsorber to bac biofilter a minimum of 20 000 bed volumes of throughput prior to evaluating biofiltration is recommended when using bac media and even higher throughput may be required if influent toc is below about 5 mg l relatively few studies have evaluated the impact of ozone on the biodegradable efom fraction an o3 toc of 1 0 yields a median bdoc toc of 59 which is more than 50 higher than without ozone on an unpaired basis 26 n 61 and very few studies reported filter biomass improved knowledge of assimilable and total biodegradable efom and filter biomass can be used to generate more precise estimates of biofilter performance the effects of wwtp treatment level upstream of biofiltration seasonality and temperature for efom removal remain to be understood meta analysis indicates that higher ozone doses and ebcts can provide meaningful gains in toc removal however data at high operating levels is relatively scarce future studies should investigate these levels in more depth to more precisely determine where diminishing returns in toc removal occur across many different source waters since high ebcts and high ozone doses are costly improved understanding of possible benefits is needed to properly support design decision making sequential use of biofilters followed by gac adsorbers could provide de facto extended biofilter ebct as the gac adsorbers acclimate to the bom and transition from gac to bac this could be especially effective when the gac adsorber is

16955,biofiltration historically used for biodegradable organic matter bom removal in drinking water treatment is being increasingly applied for potable reuse which requires unique characterization this review and meta analysis evaluates bom occurrence as part of bulk wastewater effluent organic matter efom quantifies the roles of operational parameters to achieve efom removal in biofilters and identifies research gaps which may be fruitful for understanding reuse biofilter performance literature data n 76 indicates efom has a high biodegradable fraction median 26 which after typical ozone doses is higher 57 a biofiltration performance dataset n 160 across 42 wwtp effluents shows that efom removal of 35 40 can be expected when design parameters are optimized specifically higher efom removal is achieved by adding pre ozonation and use of biological activated carbon bac media with comparatively smaller impacts of increasing ozone dose or increasing empty bed contact time under typical scenarios combined these factors strongly correlate with observed efom removal r 2 0 64 after accounting for confounding by adsorptive removal in bac media with fewer than 20 000 bed volumes treated future research that quantifies the occurrence of bom biomass activity on filter media steady state removal by bac and impacts of longer empty bed contact times in potable reuse scenarios

discharge on receiving waterbodies or augment drinking water supplies through potable reuse rapid rate biologically active granular media filtration biofiltration is well established especially in europe for removal of organic matter and contaminants in drinking water treatment terry and summers 2018 and is becoming widespread in advanced systems to treat wastewater effluents wwefs gerrity et al 2013 organic matter om in wastewater effluent includes both specific compounds e g pesticides pharmaceuticals personal care products ozonation byproducts and non specific bulk effluent organic matter efom a fraction of which is biodegradable om bom shon et al 2006 bulk efom represents the primary substrate for aerobic heterotrophic growth in biofilters its removal improves water quality directly by removing disinfection byproduct dbp precursors michael kordatou et al 2015 and decreasing microbial growth potential in distribution systems weinrich et al 2010 and also indirectly by providing the carbon source needed for metabolism of specific contaminants which occur at trace i e secondary substrate concentrations zearley and summers 2012 in potable reuse removal of bulk efom is also a specific design parameter because total organic carbon toc concentrations in common wastewater effluents 6 9 mg l krasner et al 2009 exceed typical regulatory limits e g 0 5 3 mg l u s environmental protection agency 2012 california department of public health 2018 florida potable reuse commission 2020 a range of treatment technologies can be utilized to remove efom including reverse osmosis and activated carbon adsorption however biofiltration is a comparatively lower cost lower energy usage approach which is attractive for strategies seeking to optimize performance and target water quality that is fit for purpose gerrity et al 2014 schimmoller and kealy 2014 removal of bulk efom with biofiltration has been reported in a growing body of studies which collectively comprise different source waters pretreatments and operating conditions however biofilter performance across these factors has not been well characterized most studies are logistically constrained to one or two source waters and only a few operational conditions thus effects of water quality or biofilter operation can be site specific and difficult to generalize such generalization is needed to reconcile the wide range of biofilter performance observed across and within studies for example peered reviewed studies reporting biofilter performance as toc or dissolved organic carbon doc removal include 3 15 ho et al 2011 6 30 arnold et al 2018 17 37 kalkan et al 2011 23 51 farr√© et al 2011 22 63 reungoat et al 2011 and 59 76 chuang and mitch 2017 in these and other studies efom removal not only exceeds the average bom removal achieved in drinking water rapid rate biofilters i e 10 toc removal without ozone and 15 removal after ozone but also the average total bom fraction itself 20 and 30 terry and summers 2018 and thus reuse biofilters require unique characterization the study goal was to quantitatively assess biofiltration performance for efom removal on a wide range of source waters and operational conditions to provide insight on the resulting wide ranges in efom removal reuse biofilters treating municipal wastewater effluent are implemented using principles established for drinking water given that the ratio of efom to drinking water dom is only 2 to 5 and that many drinking water sources are impacted by wastewater discharges thus this analysis is focused on treatment of wastewater effluents through the lens of well established drinking water biofiltration urfer et al 1997 zhu et al 2010 basu et al 2016 brown et al 2016 terry and summers 2018 briefly biofilter performance is related to the amount and character of influent bom and the amount and activity of filter biomass though in practice rather inexact but more easily defined surrogates are used bom is usually quantified as either biodegradable doc bdoc a measure of the total or ultimate biodegradable fraction defined as the change in doc after long term exposure to biomass or assimilable organic carbon aoc a measure of readily biodegradable om defined as the growth of specific microbial species relative to their growth on a reference substrate escobar and randall 2001 ozone pre oxidation reacts with recalcitrant om to increase the bom fraction huck 1990 biofilter performance is impacted by influent water quality conditions type and amount of bom and water temperature which affect microbial activity and operating conditions empty bed contact time ebct and media type which affect the amount of biomass use of granular activated carbon gac media is beneficial but complicates the steady state biofilter performance assessment as it may hold residual adsorption capacity psuedo first order kinetic steady state behavior based on plug flow hydraulics is a simplified but useful model of biofilter performance in this approach once acclimated and at steady state bom removal is modeled to be independent of influent bom concentration and thus can be reported on a relative percent removal basis terry and summers 2018 the specific objective was to address the following questions what level of efom removal can be expected with biofiltration and what are the contributions of operating conditions the approach taken was to first review the occurrence of bom in wastewater treatment plant effluents both with and without pre ozonation to establish a treatability baseline second a biofiltration performance database of efom removal paired to system operating parameters was complied the impacts of ozone dose ebct and media type were then evaluated in three ways 1 critical review of studies which report the impact of each parameter with paired data 2 systematic evaluation of biofiltration performance in an internal six wwef lab study and 3 meta analysis of data across all studies the role of non steady state adsorptive processes when using biological activated carbon bac media is addressed finally a descriptive model is used to evaluate the combined effects of the treatment parameters on efom removal across all source waters in the meta analysis dataset and recommendations for future research are presented 2 methods 2 1 external data collection and screening criteria three databases were developed to address the specific objectives both peer reviewed and gray literature e g conference proceedings dissertations utility reports were investigated the first database assessed bom occurrence in wwefs n 76 from 12 studies table si 4 1 the second database assessed the transition from gac a condition in which dom removal is dominated by gac adsorption to bac a condition in which dom removal is dominated by biodegradation of bom n 50 from 21 studies table si 5 1 the most extensive database was developed from studies that reported bom removal from efom by biofiltration and the associated biofilter operating parameters n 286 forty two studies on biofiltration of municipal wastewater efom that reported all of the following criteria were retained in this database 1 biofilter influent toc or doc concentration 2 bom removal reported as absolute or percent change in toc or doc concentration 3 ozone dose or specific ozone dose o3 toc mg mg 4 ebct 5 granular media type either inert typically sand or anthracite or bac and 6 for bac media the throughput in bed volumes treated before sampling studies using bac media for which prior throughput was unknown were also included if the media had been in use at field scale for at least 2 years i e about 35 000 bed volumes at 30 min ebct other parameters were considered as eligibility criteria including temperature the biodegradable efom fraction bdoc or aoc and biomass quantification but not used because they were not frequently reported it is common to locate additional pre treatment processes between the wwtp secondary process and the biofilter and in most cases results from these studies were included in the analysis examples of these pretreatments include tertiary filtration rapid sand or cartridge coagulation and ozonation when significant pretreatment was reported e g ozonation at high dose and not immediately preceding biofiltration ion exchange for dom removal those results were excluded 2 2 internal wwef treatability study in addition to the external data biofiltration results generated by the authors as part of a larger study to evaluate dbp control in wwefs by coagulation ozonation biofiltration and gac adsorption were included summers et al 2020 one motivation for including the data in this review was inert media was used while most published wwef studies 88 used bac media the laboratory study evaluated six different wwefs for bdoc table si 2 2 and biofiltration performance with inert anthracite media specific ozone doses of 0 and 1 0 o3 toc mg mg and ebcts of 5 15 and 30 min table si 2 1 the ozonation biofiltration and analytical methods were reported previously summers et al 2020 the toc removal data from this study n 36 was compared to the literature data for inert media alone n 29 and no evidence was found to suggest that the laboratory data would introduced bias in interpreting the literature dataset a detailed description of this analysis is in si section 3 2 3 data pre processing the initial biofilter performance dataset contained 286 observations of efom removal by biofiltration across 42 unique wwtp effluents from 43 studies unique wwtps were identified by name or by a combination of location and treatment process description some studies evaluated multiple wwtps and some wwtps were evaluated in multiple studies data were grouped by wwtp rather than by study to isolate variations in treatability by water quality rather than research publication the median number of observations per wwtp was 3 with a maximum of 86 to avoid over leveraging wwtps with more available data a preprocessing step was used to consolidate the data for each wwtp effluent by binning across similar operating parameters the following bins were used o3 toc mg mg 0 0 to 0 6 0 6 to 0 9 0 9 to 1 2 1 2 ebct min 0 to 8 8 to 16 16 to 24 24 to 32 32 media type inert bac for each wwtp effluent bin combination the average of each inclusion criteria i e toc removal o3 toc ebct and bac throughput were retained as single estimators for that bin the resulting biofiltration performance dataset n 160 was used for further evaluation studies which systematically evaluated different operating conditions are summarized in table 1 and the full dataset is available in table si 1 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 biofiltration dataset descriptive statistics the distributions of biofilter influent efom toc concentrations and treatment operating parameters o3 toc ebct and bac throughput in the initial dataset are shown in fig 1 we evaluated each distribution and determined that the dataset is a good representation of typical field scale conditions as follows the toc median concentration 7 5 mg l and interquartile range iqr 6 3 to 9 6 mg l are representative of typical wwtp effluents for example these values are consistent with surveyed wwtps n 38 that practice nitrification krasner et al 2009 the median specific ozone dose 0 8 mg o3 mg toc and iqr 0 6 to 1 0 coincide with doses typically used to achieve multiple ozonation objectives in potable reuse including disinfection and trace organic contaminant mitigation while balancing formation of negative byproducts and cost gerrity et al 2012 2014 lee et al 2013 in 35 cases 41 ozone was not utilized figure si 1 1 the median ebct of 15 min iqr 10 to 30 min is consistent to the median ebct of 18 min in the full scale facilities n 9 in the dataset for bac media the throughput in number of bed volumes treated prior to sampling had a wide and distributed range from below 2000 bed volumes to higher than 100 000 not shown in fig 1 are throughput values above 60 000 bed volumes n 16 which represents bac media from full scale filters which had been in use for multiple years i e 2 years at the median 17 min ebct the impact of residual adsorption at low throughput values was separately evaluated section 3 3 3 2 biodegradable efom occurrence and removal dissolved organic matter in both wwef and dw source waters consists of a range of heterogeneous compounds that have a distribution of biodegradable behavior a biodegradable fraction and a recalcitrant fraction are operationally defined based on laboratory tests the biodegradable fraction represents a continuum with some compounds being readily consumed often term rapid fast or easily biodegradable and others being more recalcitrant but ultimately biodegradable given time and the method of characterization two measures of the biodegradable fraction aoc and bdoc commonly applied to natural waters and for treatment and distribution of conventional drinking water have also been applied to wwef servais et al 1987 khan et al 1998b weinrich et al 2009 3 2 1 occurrence of biodegradable efom without ozone secondary treatment biological at the wwtp does not achieve complete bom removal in a survey of 21 wwtp effluents an average biodegradable efom fraction bdoc doc of 23 and a range of 4 41 were reported weinrich et al 2010 a similarly wide range of results were found across other surveys range 3 66 n 17 krasner et al 2009 range 9 33 n 13 khan et al 1998a range 23 35 n 8 babcock et al 2001 and range 33 44 n 6 from the internal six wwef study si table 2 2 the results from these and other studies are summarized in si table 4 1 and taking all data together results in a median bdoc doc of 26 interquartile range 18 34 and a minimum and maximum of 3 and 70 respectively si fig 4 1 lower effluent bdoc and toc have been associated with wwtps that provide higher levels of biological treatment either based on longer solids retention time khan et al 1998a or level of nitrification denitrification achieved krasner et al 2009 however in this dataset there is no significant correlation between effluent toc and the biodegradable fraction when toc is above 3 mg l p 0 25 r2 0 02 si fig 4 3 which indicates that wwtp effluent toc concentration may not be a reliable surrogate for its biodegradability the type of wwtp treatment process has also been associated with different levels of bdoc with attached growth processes i e trickling filters having higher bdoc doc 35 on average weinrich et al 2010 and up to 70 cha et al 2004 while mbr effluents commonly have low bdoc doc about 10 15 krasner et al 2009 weinrich et al 2010 lee et al 2012 figure si 4 1 however the extent to which these differences result from inherent effects of the treatment processes or other variables has not been well defined weinrich et al 2010 in their survey n 21 found a median aoc bdoc of 50 iqr 35 68 indicating that the typical biodegradable fraction of wwef is relatively balanced between readily assimilable compounds and more recalcitrant but ultimately biodegradable constituents 3 2 2 occurrence of biodegradable efom after ozone ozone is widely acknowledged to substantially increase the biodegradability of dom as such biofiltration is often placed downstream of an ozonation process gerrity et al 2013 ozone reacts quickly with unsaturated bonds in dom breaking aromatic rings and forming oxygenated low molecular weight byproducts including carboxylic acids aldehydes and ketones von gunten 2003 ozonation byproducts are themselves ozone resistant and accumulate with increasing ozone dose thus ozonation largely transforms but does not mineralize dom von gunten 2003 in the absence of nitrite or other reduced inorganics ozone decomposition and exposure is directly controlled by reactions between ozone and efom buffle et al 2006 the specific ozone dose o3 toc mg mg units used throughout is often used to normalize ozone dose and exposure reported as the nitrite adjusted dose to isolate reactions with organics despite variations in efom composition across different wastewater effluents strong relationships have been reported between o3 toc and ozone exposure buffle et al 2006 and change in uv absorbance wert et al 2009 arnold et al 2018 which support this approach despite wide evaluation of ozone reactivity with dissolved compounds relatively few studies have quantified the effect of ozone dose on changes in the biodegradable fraction of efom si figure 4 2 lee et al 2012 systematically evaluated the change in bdoc resulting from specific ozone doses in the 0 3 to 3 0 range on an mbr effluent toc 3 7 mg l ozonation caused a substantial increase in bdoc doc from about 14 with no ozonation up to 45 at o3 toc of 1 0 and a maximum of 61 at o3 toc of about 2 0 the change in bdoc was approximately linear in the o3 toc range of 0 to 1 with decreasing bdoc yield at higher doses li et al 2006 found that an o3 toc dose of about 1 0 increased the bdoc doc from about 25 to 60 and in the internal six wwef study it increased from an average of 40 to 62 n 6 table si 2 1 while other studies report smaller effects after ozonation at similar doses amy et al 1996 wang et al 2008 on an aoc basis wert et al 2007 observed an increase from 5 to 16 after ozonation of a wwtp effluent practicing tertiary coagulation with the majority of the increase occurring below o3 toc of 0 5 in contrast li et al 2017 reported a higher aoc increase 31 from a secondary treated wwtp and with the majority of the increase occurring above o3 toc of 0 4 taken together efom ozonation at doses to achieve typical objectives o3 toc 0 6 to 1 0 described in section 3 1 can be expected to yield a substantial bom fraction measured either by bdoc or aoc across many types of biological processes used at wwtps an o3 toc of 1 0 yields a median bdoc toc of 59 which is 50 higher than without ozone on a paired basis 39 n 10 and more than double when compared to the dataset as a whole i e on an unpaired basis 26 n 61 however the small bdoc dataset for ozonated efom n 14 indicates that research is needed to better understand the dose response relationship between ozone and formation of bdoc and aoc in wastewater effluents understanding the total biodegradable fraction and development of more precise estimates of the biodegradable continuum is needed to properly evaluate biofilter performance and to account for the possibility of biofilm growth downstream in distribution systems or building premise plumbing as potable reuse becomes more widely adopted 3 2 3 removal of biodegradable efom during biofiltration incomplete bom removal is observed during biofiltration under normal ebcts 60 min bdoc removals of 30 lee et al 2012 60 li et al 2006 and 75 kalkan et al 2011 have been reported from efom in the internal six wwef study the average bdoc removal across the six wastewater effluents ranged from 10 no ozone 5 min ebct to 50 o3 toc 1 0 30 min ebct this range of bdoc removal is similar to that seen during biofiltration of conventional drinking waters 25 80 juhna and melin 2006 similarly terry and summers 2018 in their meta analysis of drinking water biofilter performance found that median toc removal was about 50 of median bdoc for both ozonated and non ozonated waters given that only 8 of the literature treatment data found was expressed as bdoc or aoc the results herein will be expressed on a toc basis 3 3 determination of steady state bac biofilter performance the use of gac in biofilters has many benefits which include residual adsorption capacity for strongly adsorbing compounds and the ability to attenuate influent spikes of adsorbing compounds the transition of fresh gac into biological activated carbon bac consists of decreasing adsorptive removal that overlaps with the establishment of bio removal which makes characterization of biological performance difficult fig 2 in terry and summers 2018 the adsorption capacity utilization phase can last for several months and longer depending on filter size and the physiochemical properties of both the adsorbent and adsorbate for example slow adsorption of large molecular weight dom into gac micropores can take months peel and benedek 1983 summers and roberts 1987 sontheimer et al 1988 and more strongly adsorbing compounds can take months to years to deplete the adsorption capacity kennedy et al 2015 this overlaps with the bioacclimation phase both in the establishment of the type and concentration of biomass needed to metabolize bom which takes a few weeks to a few months wang et al 1995 greenstein et al 2018 sundaram et al 2020 and in the adaptation of the biomass to degrade more recalcitrant compounds which can take longer zearley and summers 2012 the transition to steady state bioremoval is asymptotic and dependent on water quality factors such as temperature and bom characteristics to best characterize long term bac performance the unsteady state contribution of adsorption should be minimized if the bac filter is not operated for enough time an over estimate of the long term bom removal will be made as such an estimate of the time or throughput needed to allow adsorption to become a small part of the overall bom removal is needed zachman and summers 2010 have systematically shown that adsorption capacity is higher for low dom concentration and ph smaller gac size and longer ebct in particular the run time throughput to a target effluent concentration is inversely proportional to the dom influent concentration we hypothesized that high toc removal observed in some studies with bac media might be explained in part by residual adsorption rather than biofiltration alone overstating steady state biofilter performance a literature review of full or pilot scale gac application to wwefs was conducted and the transition from gac adsorption to steady state ss toc bioremoval i e bac as a function of influent toc concentration was assessed for 26 gac runs fig 2a summarized in table si 5 1 other parameters known to impact steady state throughput e g temperature ph and gac type and size were not reported with enough frequency to quantify their impact the average steady state removal after gac transition to bac was 25 8 it is often difficult to establish the point at which steady state removal is achieved when sufficient data were available a slope of 0 3 change 1000 bed volumes was used as the steady state removal criterion however most studies were plagued by insufficient data at long run times and variations in the influent concentration or upstream operating conditions the relationship between influent toc and throughput to 80 breakthrough from the meta analysis of 26 gac runs reported by benstoem et al 2017 is also shown in fig 2a again other parameters known to impact gac performance were not reported throughput data from both the field studies evaluated at steady state average 25 removal and benstoem et al 2017 study at 80 breakthrough 20 removal were combined and the overall regression for these 52 data points is also shown in fig 2a while influent ph ebct and gac type and size are not modeled by this relationship it can serve as a guide for estimating the run length of a gac adsorber with coal based gac bituminous or lignite to the point at which adsorption is not a major factor in toc removal the relationship can be further estimated by the product of 90 000 to the inverse of the influent toc for lower ph 7 5 longer ebcts 15 min and smaller gac particle size 12 40 sieve longer run times would be expected before adsorptive toc removal is negligible thus new pilot studies that are only interested in long term bioremoval assessment and not evaluating gac to bac transition should consider using gac from other sites with similar water quality this media should be re acclimated to the new source water until a steady state removal is established the effect of throughput on bulk organic matter removal as toc for adsorptive media in the biofiltration performance dataset n 89 is shown in fig 2b using a bin width of 10 000 bed volumes only steady state operation data either as defined by the authors of these studies or as determined in this review by analysis of the endpoints of the toc breakthrough curves when available are shown in fig 2b under steady state conditions average toc removal is independent of throughput however in the dataset the median toc removal for biofilters with less than 10 000 bed volumes treated was nearly four fold higher than for those with greater than 40 000 bed volumes treated 70 and 18 respectively compared to 40 000 bed volumes toc removal was higher for 0 10 000 p 0 001 and 10 000 20 000 bed volumes p 0 001 but was not significantly different for bins above 20 000 bed volumes p 0 3 anova and tukey s hsd additionally the relative throughput defined as the ratio of throughput achieved to predicted throughput required for reaching steady state fig 2a was calculated for the dataset a relative throughput of 1 0 or greater indicates that sufficient bed volumes were treated to reach steady state based on influent toc assuming the organic matter exhibits average treatability for throughput below 20 000 bed volumes median toc removal when relative throughput was 1 0 or above 26 was lower than for relative throughput below 1 0 68 while for throughput above 20 000 bed volumes median toc removal 20 was independent of relative throughput figure si 5 1 in combination higher toc removal was associated with adsorptive media biofilters which were evaluated at low throughput less than 20 000 bed volumes and for which influent toc was low relative throughput less than 1 indicating non steady state behavior even when all biofilters were reported to be operating at steady state to account for the significant effect of throughput on toc removal in this meta analysis data for adsorptive media filters were re classified as bac when throughput exceeded 20 000 bed volumes or when relative throughput was 1 0 or higher and as gac when neither threshold was achieved of 89 data points 40 were classified as gac indicating that a large portion of the dataset represents biofilters for which adsorptive processes could be expected fig 2c toc removal with gac media was 29 percentage points higher on average compared to bac media even when accounting for effects of ebct and o3 toc ancova p 0 001 as a result data for gac media are excluded from further discussion and the meta analysis 3 4 effects of biofilter operating parameters on wwef toc removal the effects of ozone ebct and media type on toc removal are shown in fig 3 using bins to illustrate the dataset as a whole i e on an unpaired basis for each bin no systematic differences in the prevalence of the other parameters were found thus the effects of ozone ebct media type and water temperature are reviewed individually in this section analysis of the operating parameters all together with ozone dose and ebct taken as continuous variables will follow in section 3 5 3 4 1 ozone and ozone dose for the dataset as a whole biofiltration without pre ozonation n 44 yielded a median toc removal of 13 fig 3 and with pre ozonation which increases the bom fraction the toc removal increased to 21 n 73 higher toc removal after pre ozonation is also reported in studies with paired data and the magnitude of the difference is often higher than indicated in the whole dataset these paired data cover a wide range of wwtps and biofilter operating parameters summarized in table si 6 2 most commonly toc removal was 10 20 percentage points p p higher for biofilters after ozonation o3 toc 0 5 1 1 compared to no ozonation olivier 2001 farr√© et al 2011 gifford et al 2018 and the internal six wwef study yielded 7 18 p p higher removal after ozonation at o3 toc 1 0 table si 2 1 the difference in toc removal ranged from as high as 30 p p bacaro et al 2019 to as low as 4 p p bourgin et al 2018 the impact of different ozone doses however is more varied gifford et al 2018 fit linear relationships between ozone dose and toc removal across o3 toc of 0 3 1 2 for bac and anthracite media on an mbr effluent the fitted slopes were 1 2 1 4 p p higher toc removal per 0 1 o3 toc dose increase indicating that large changes in o3 toc were required to achieve substantially higher toc removal similarly lee et al 2012 observed a 9 p p increase in toc removal when o3 toc was increased from 0 5 to 1 0 though the toc removal was much smaller than the increase in o3 derived bdoc i e bdoc toc of 54 compared to 14 without ozone which may be the result of media type anthracite or ebct 20 min applying even higher ozone doses o3 toc 2 0 vs 1 0 can further improve toc removal by about 5 10 p p but the marginal benefit is lower lee et al 2012 arnold et al 2018 in contrast some studies report no substantial increase in toc removal with increasing ozone dose across o3 toc 0 35 1 chuang and mitch 2017 or 1 0 2 0 sundaram et al 2020 zhu et al 2015 reported small incremental improvements in dom removal on a cod basis across o3 toc 0 6 to 1 2 although removal reached about 10 p p higher on average at these endpoints the difference in means was smaller than the standard deviations overall pre ozonation improves biofilter performance but only modest gains can be expected at incrementally higher ozone doses e g from 0 8 to 1 0 bigger performance gains are expected with much larger ozone doses but because of higher cost and challenges with bromate formation ozone dose will likely be determined by other treatment objectives in a potable reuse scenario such as disinfection 3 4 2 empty bed contact time longer ebcts can increase dom removal as more exposure to biomass is provided wang et al 1995 for the whole dataset increasing the ebct from below 8 min n 28 to 8 to 16 min n 44 increased the median toc removal from 10 to 17 fig 3 incremental dom removal decreases at longer ebcts as the more easily biodegradable substrate is preferentially removed in the upper filter leaving only more recalcitrant compounds in the lower filter zearley and summers 2012 in drinking water treatment toc removal typically begins to plateau at ebcts in the range of 5 to 15 min terry and summers 2018 however as shown in fig 3 no plateau in median efom removal is evident up through 30 min ebct this is consistent with higher overall bdoc in wwefs compared to typical drinking waters section 3 1 and suggests that a substantial portion of the bdoc is relatively recalcitrant requiring longer ebcts for removal biofilters treating wwef typically have utilized longer ebcts median 18 min in the nine full scale facilities in the dataset than those utilized in conventional drinking water biofilters median 7 min brown et al 2016 in the most extensively investigated source water with paired data an mbr pilot plant using both anthracite and 5 year old bac maximum toc removal was typically achieved at or below 10 min ebct gifford et al 2018 bacaro et al 2019 the exception was after high ozone dose o3 toc 2 3 where toc removal increased by 6 p p when ebct was increased from 10 min to 20 min arnold et al 2018 in contrast in the internal six wwef study using anthracite media across six non mbr wwtps higher toc removal was consistently observed with increasing ebct in each water both from ebct 5 to 15 min and from 15 to 30 min and both with and without ozone table si 2 1 in these waters increasing ebct from 5 to 15 min after pre ozonation improved toc removal by an average of 10 p p and increasing ebct to 30 min improved toc removal by an additional 10 p p other studies which evaluated the effect of ebct have used bac media which started as fresh gac table si 6 3 in these studies extending ebct to longer than 20 min improved toc removal by up to 8 p p olivier 2001 12 p p gerrity et al 2011 and 23 p p farr√© et al 2011 compared to performance below 20 min kalkan et al 2011 investigated two types of bac media in parallel and reported a similar increase in toc removal for a thermally activated carbon 7 p p ebct 9 to 18 min but no increase in toc removal for a chemically activated carbon a challenge with interpreting bac results even with paired data is that each ebct has achieved a different throughput therefore the role of ebct can be confounded with the role of residual adsorption as an example a gac to bac filter operated for 9 months will have treated about 80 000 bvs at 5 min ebct but just 13 000 bvs at 30 min it could be expected that the biomass profile throughout the filter has reached steady state and that minimal adsorption capacity remains in the upper filter but the lower filter remains squarely in the adsorption mass transfer zone while the above referenced studies were screened for bac throughput to minimize adsorptive confounding section 3 3 it is not possible to isolate biological processes within the data itself the study by vaidya et al 2019 however reported 21 toc removal in a bac biofilter 5 min ebct and an additional 20 toc removal in a gac adsorber 10 min ebct which was operated to 40 000 bed volumes and exhibited pseudo steady state behavior this indicates that ebct played a major role in the 16 p p increase in toc removal at the total 15 min ebct compared to 5 min for bac media both the dataset as a whole and the paired data studies show that ebcts above 8 min normally provide meaningfully higher toc removal than lower ebcts in many cases extending ebct above 20 or 30 min can also have a significant benefit this supports the current practice of using longer ebcts than in conventional drinking water treatment and indicates that even longer ebcts could be useful in practice designers and operators must balance the increased cost and operational complexity of longer ebcts with potential negative impacts of a residual biodegradable efom being released to the subsurface or distribution system in potable reuse scenarios 3 4 3 media type as stated in section 3 3 gac is often used for biofilter media as it offers several advantages over inert media including better toc removal however the performance of biofilters that use gac as media can be substantially higher due to residual toc adsorption capacity when prior throughput and influent toc are low the bac data in fig 3 does not include that from biofilters with gac that did not meet the minimum throughput criteria 20 000 bv and the toc removal with bac media was still higher than inert media on average by 7 percentage points 15 vs 23 similarly paired studies that evaluated both inert and bac media also 20 000 bv under the same feed water and operational conditions i e ozone dose and ebct almost always report higher toc removal with bac media than inert media si table 6 1 the largest differences in toc removal were in the range of 21 27 percentage points higher in bac filters in two studies that use long ebcts 60 min and 40 min respectively farr√© et al 2011 reaume et al 2015 smaller increases in bom removal with bac were reported in the other studies ho et al 2011 observed 10 12 p p higher toc removal in bac under non ozonated conditions with the difference driven by very low toc removal in the inert media columns 3 5 in several studies with mbr pilot plant effluent the toc removal ranged from 6 to 40 and the bac filter consistently outperformed the parallel anthracite filter by 1 12 p p median 5 5 p p arnold et al 2018 gifford et al 2018 bacaro et al 2019 hooper et al 2020 found a 7 percentage point effect for bac compared to anthracite at low temperatures 12 15 oc despite a shorter ebct 7 5 min vs 12 min in contrast zhu et al 2015 reported no significant difference between anthracite and bac on a cod basis and bourgin et al 2018 observed slightly higher toc removal in a full scale sand filter compared to a pilot scale bac filter 20 vs 18 and despite the bac filter having a longer ebct 18 min vs 10 min in these paired studies the advantage of bac over inert media biofilters was greatest for systems that started with onsite gac and ran the filters long enough 20 000 bv to yield bac compared to studies that sampled used gac from an offsite full scale facility or previous studies in the latter case in which the risk of residual non steady state adsorption is less likely performance with bac media ranged from about 10 percentage points better to no substantial effect in total there is strong evidence that bac media can be expected to outperform inert media even when controlling for residual non steady state adsorptive capacity however very large differences may indicate non steady state behavior in the bac which should be closely evaluated 3 4 4 temperature water temperature affects microbial activity and can significantly affect the kinetics of bom removal in biofilters for example in drinking water treatment achieving 50 bdoc removal requires a 14 min ebct on average for temperatures below 10 oc while only 4 min ebct is required for temperatures above 20 oc terry and summers 2018 the effects of temperature on kinetics of efom removal however have been largely neglected in the dataset only 17 of 43 studies reported water temperature data during their evaluation of biofiltration thirteen of these studies evaluated a single temperature each within the narrow range of 22 25 oc and the others reported a wider temperature range e g 13 28 oc across their testing but did not isolate the role of temperature on biofilter performance thus the impact of temperature on efom removal specifically any important deviations from that seen during conventional drinking water biofiltration remains unknown 3 5 regression evaluation of biofiltration performance the combined impacts of ozone dose ebct and media type on biofilter performance were evaluated with a linear regression this descriptive model approach was used in order to estimate the relative contributions of each operating parameter on observed efom removal and to identify the variance associated with these controllable factors the model space was defined as ebct 5 30 min o3 toc 0 1 2 and toc removal 0 which encapsulates the majority of the dataset n 98 out of 118 data outside the model space plus one high leverage value were removed as outliers the regression model results are shown in table 2 with simulated toc removal represented by the standardized regression coefficient Œ≤ and visualized in fig 4 a with isoremoval lines as a function of o3 toc and ebct for each media type the regression intercept represents the simulated toc removal when all parameters are at the dataset average ¬µ and remaining coefficients represent the change in simulated toc removal when the operating parameter is changed by one standard deviation œÉ2 the toc removal simulation range 5 32 matches the observed 5th and 95th percentiles in the dataset 3 31 and each main effect correlated strongly with toc removal p 0 001 toc removal with bac media was substantially higher than for inert media 8 7 percentage points on average after controlling for adsorption which supports the use of bac media in reuse biofilters ozone dose affected toc removal by 1 2 p p per 0 1 change in specific dose similar to that found by gifford et al 2018 for one feed water avg 1 3 p p per 0 1 change in specific dose for both ozone dose and ebct i e 1 p p per 2 2 min change in ebct relatively large operational changes are required to expect meaningful impact on toc removal additionally strong evidence was found of a positive interactive effect between ebct and o3 toc p 0 011 this suggests that longer ebct may be more effective when more bom is formed at higher ozone doses however the actual effect size Œ≤ 1 4 was relatively small such an interactive effect was observed experimentally by gifford et al 2018 where increasing ozone dose also required a longer ebct to maximize toc removal weaker evidence was found for a positive interactive effect between bac media and longer ebct Œ≤ 2 0 p 0 18 applying these interactive effects is difficult because relatively few data exist for high o3 toc or for bac media with high ebct this analysis suggests that future research in these areas is warranted the meta analysis multiple linear regression was statistically significant p 2e 16 and provides good correlation adj r 2 0 64 considering the scope and context of this analysis i e evaluating three operational parameters for total not biodegradable organic carbon removal across a diverse range of studies incorporating more precise water quality parameters and standardization of biofiltration methods e g ensuring scalability mckie et al 2019 terry et al 2019 may help explain the remaining variance the regression presented here was judged to be an appropriate representation of the dataset based on residuals analysis figure si 7 1 and though transformed and non linear model forms were also considered none presented a better fit to the data future research is needed to more completely describe biofilter performance at higher ozone doses and ebcts and the least squares average toc removal presented here should not be extrapolated beyond the model space the distribution of the regression model residuals gives insight into expected performance variations that can benchmark future research and implementation of reuse biofilters fig 4b the residuals interquartile range was 3 5 percentage points i e half of the data was within this range indicating that operational parameters alone yield a suitably precise treatability estimate on average to be useful for preliminary design and for designing bench and pilot scale studies for many wwtp effluents further the standard deviation of the residuals 5 6 percentage points indicates the likelihood of biofilter performance which diverges from the average for example toc removal outside of 11 p p 2 standard deviations of the regression relationship is statistically unlikely given the current dataset and observations of such outlier data should be closely studied as fundamental insights into good or bad biofilter performance could provide a large step forward for the field 4 conclusions recommendations and areas for future research a meta analysis was used to evaluate the effects of the operation parameters ozone dose ebct and media type on effluent organic matter removal by biofiltration each operating parameter had a significant impact on observed toc removal which were quantified with a regression model performance of bac media can be significantly influenced by run time throughput prior to data collection and the combination of slow adsorption and biodegradation combined with normal influent water quality perturbations makes it difficult to ascertain steady state behavior during transition from gac adsorber to bac biofilter a minimum of 20 000 bed volumes of throughput prior to evaluating biofiltration is recommended when using bac media and even higher throughput may be required if influent toc is below about 5 mg l relatively few studies have evaluated the impact of ozone on the biodegradable efom fraction an o3 toc of 1 0 yields a median bdoc toc of 59 which is more than 50 higher than without ozone on an unpaired basis 26 n 61 and very few studies reported filter biomass improved knowledge of assimilable and total biodegradable efom and filter biomass can be used to generate more precise estimates of biofilter performance the effects of wwtp treatment level upstream of biofiltration seasonality and temperature for efom removal remain to be understood meta analysis indicates that higher ozone doses and ebcts can provide meaningful gains in toc removal however data at high operating levels is relatively scarce future studies should investigate these levels in more depth to more precisely determine where diminishing returns in toc removal occur across many different source waters since high ebcts and high ozone doses are costly improved understanding of possible benefits is needed to properly support design decision making sequential use of biofilters followed by gac adsorbers could provide de facto extended biofilter ebct as the gac adsorbers acclimate to the bom and transition from gac to bac this could be especially effective when the gac adsorber is operated in parallel blended effluent mode which could prolong the run life of gac adsorbers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

16956,poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas comprise more than 4 000 anthropogenically manufactured compounds with widescale consumer and industrial applications this critical review compiles the latest information on the worldwide distribution of pfas and evaluates their fate in wastewater treatment plants wwtps a large proportion 30 of monitoring studies in wwtps were conducted in china followed by europe 30 and north america 16 whereas information is generally lacking for other parts of the world including most of the developing countries short and long chain perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas were widely detected in both the influents up to 1 000 ng l and effluents 15 to 1 500 ng l of wwtps to date limited data is available regarding levels of pfas precursors and ultra short chain pfas in wwtps most wwtps exhibited low removal efficiencies for pfas and many studies reported an increase in the levels of pfaas after wastewater treatment the analysis of the fate of various classes of pfas at different wastewater treatment stages aerobic and aerobic biodegradation photodegradation and chemical degradation revealed biodegradation as the primary mechanism responsible for the transformation of pfas precursors to pfaas in wwtps remediation studies at full scale and laboratory scale suggest advanced processes such as adsorption using ion exchange resins electrochemical degradation and nanofiltration are more effective in removing pfas 95 100 than conventional processes however the applicability of such treatments for real world wwtps faces significant challenges due to the scaling up requirements mass transfer limitations and management of treatment by products and wastes combining more than one technique for effective removal of pfas while addressing limitations of the individual treatments could be beneficial considering environmental concentrations of pfas cost effectiveness and ease of operation nanofiltration followed by adsorption using wood derived biochar and or activated carbons could be a viable option if introduced to conventional treatment systems however the large scale applicability of the same needs to be further verified graphical

used in various industrial and commercial products from the mid twentieth century wang et al 2017 comprised of a hydrophobic fluorinated alkyl chain at one end and a hydrophilic functional group at the other arvaniti et al 2014 pfas cnf2n 1 r r functional group meng et al 2020 buck et al 2011 have high thermal and chemical stability owing to the strong c f bonds mulabagal et al 2018 this unique combination of physical and chemical properties along with the hydrophobic and lipophobic moieties make pfas extremely suitable as water and oil repellants and friction resistants kwiatkowski et al 2020 due to the desired performance and production suitability pfas are manufactured massively for wide scale industrial manufacturing of paper textiles pesticides leather medical aids oil and minerals metal plating etc and consumer applications food packaging cosmetics and personal care products paints inks non stick cooking utensils surfactants firefighting foams and several other waterproof products gagliano et al 2020 ji et al 2020 wang et al 2017 lu et al 2017 kotthoff et al 2015 the general purpose of treating consumer products with pfas is to impart an extended service life and durability this practice in turn results in prolonged exposure of humans wildlife and the environment to pfas herzke et al 2012 although pfas have been used widely since the 1950s it was only after the first report of pfas in wildlife and human serum in the early 2000s that scientific studies on the properties occurrence environmental fate and health effects of pfas accelerated cousins 2015 over the past few decades pfas have been widely detected in the environment nakayama et al 2019 and they are ubiquitous in almost all aquatic matrices such as drinking water surface water groundwater and coastal water wei et al 2018 humans can be exposed to pfas through drinking water and dietary intake domingo nadal 2019 sunderland et al 2019 wei et al 2018 studies have reported that several acute as well as chronic human diseases such as thyroid asthma anxiety obesity pediatric allergies hyperuricemia peroxisome proliferation immune toxicity kidney disorders liver damage and cardiovascular diseases may be associated with pfas exposure ruan et al 2019 jian et al 2017 suja et al 2009 other studies have demonstrated toxic effects such as immunotoxicity carcinogenicity and hormonal disorders of some perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas on animals poothong et al 2020 rand mabury 2017 today more than 4 000 pfas are manufactured and used worldwide including both conventional e g pfoa and pfos and alternative pfas short chain pfas and newly identified fluorinated replacements of conventional pfas pan et al 2019 anticipating long term exposure effects due to their persistent and bio accumulative nature ateia et al 2019a wang et al 2016 conventional pfas were voluntarily phased out wang et al 2014b krafft riess 2015 due to regulations e g us epa drinking

alternative pfas have also been detected abundantly in wwtps by several studies with concentrations up to some hundred ng l table 2 and 3 short chain pfas being highly mobile are detected in all ecosystems brendel et al 2018 and can be equally toxic as their longer chain counterparts li et al 2020 the occurrence of pfas in wwtps has been reviewed earlier by arvaniti stasinakis 2015 however more than 100 new monitoring studies have been published since 2015 some involve aspects not covered earlier such as the effect of different treatment stages of a wwtp on removal efficiencies and the transformation of pfas precursors to perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas during wastewater treatment that allows a better understanding of the fate of pfas in wwtps overall this article aims at providing a systematic overview of the up to date knowledge on the occurrence fate transformation and removal of pfas in wwtps first the sampling and analysis methods adopted in monitoring studies are discussed followed by the global occurrence data of different types of pfas in the influents and effluents of wwtps the removal efficiencies and mechanisms are then discussed in detail emphasising the fate of pfas in a full scale treatment plant and the transformation of pfas precursors during treatment this comprehensive review on the levels and fate of conventional and alternative pfas in wwtps along with their removal at different scales allows the identification of research gaps those are compiled in the last section along with suggestions for future research concerning alternative pfas especially ultra short chain pfas and pfas precursors transformation mechanism of pfas precursors and large scale applications of laboratory tested pfas treatment techniques 2 sampling and analysis measuring pfas at environmentally relevant concentrations ng l comes with a series of associated challenges from sampling to analysis the sampling laboratory and analytical components e g sample collection equipment and containers laboratory consumables analytical grade water and solvents sample preparation and analytical instruments can potentially cause background interference owing to the ubiquitous presence of pfas al amin et al 2020 misa and kennedy 2018 table 1 summarizes the commonly practised sampling and analytical procedures applied when monitoring pfas in wastewaters ideally glass and fluoropolymer containers should be strictly avoided while collecting and storing samples lath et al 2019 this is because of the tendency of pfas to adsorb onto glass surface tian and sun 2019 and contamination from fluoropolymer e g ptfe polytetrafluoroethylene containers chen et al 2018 may result in inaccurate analysis while recent studies have mostly used either polypropylene or high density polyethylene hdpe bottles for the collection of samples table 1 the consequences of using glass containers on quantification remain ambiguous kibambe et al 2020 nakayama et al 2019 ciofi et al 2018 cleaning all the sampling equipment and containers with tap water followed by triple rinsing with ultra pure water and methanol can reduce background contamination elmoznino et al 2018 it is essential to carefully consider the variableness for a wwtp e g diurnal seasonal and representativeness of a sample without which the evaluation of pfas is of the least value liu et al 2020 gallen et al 2018 berger et al 2011 many recent studies have relied on composite sampling for observing the presence of pfas in wwtps table 3 grab samples wang et al 2020c elmoznino et al 2018 could be considered less representative as they fail to take into account the diurnal variations in wastewater flow and may not be apt to understand the diversity in pfas quality and quantity during the treatment though acidification kibambe et al 2020 nguyen et al 2019 and refrigeration zhou et al 2019 dauchy et al 2017 of biologically active samples such as wastewater and sludge can reduce the biodegradation potential of pfas precursors tian and sun 2019 the excess protons in acidic water could lead to the adsorption of pfas onto the container surface upon acidification ateia et al 2019b most studies refrigerated samples at 4 c table 1 as recommended by standard methods epa 537 1 2018 d 7979 19 2019 to ensure the preservation of target pfas until analysis the typically low concentrations of pfas in wastewater table 3 along with the high levels of organic matter and inorganic salts may result in inaccurate quantification of the target compounds liu et al 2020 al amin et al 2020 huset et al 2011 hence clean up and concentration of wastewater are vital steps prior to pfas analysis despite the capability of glass fibre cellulose acetate nylon etc to adsorb or release pfas tian and sun 2019 filtration using glass fibres prior to extraction is often applied table 1 as polypropylene filters can also retain long chain pfas elmoznino et al 2018 future studies could rely on centrifugation for pre cleaning wastewaters table 1 at present solid phase extraction spe using weak anion exchange wax adsorbents is the primary sample clean up approach for wastewater matrices table 1 and table 4 as wax cartridges have shown better recoveries for short chain pfas than other polymeric cartridges such as hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb pan et al 2019 mullin et al

with sample manipulation during spe nakayama et al 2019 ciofi et al 2018 most studies have used ultra high performance liquid chromatography to analyse pfas with the mass spectroscopy usually operated in negative electron ionisation mode as most target pfas are anionic nakayama et al 2019 while the predominantly used reversed phase chromatography columns work well for most anionic pfas separation of highly polar short chain pfas especially ultra short chain c 4 is challenging tian and sun 2019 due to their higher solubility and poor retainability yeung et al 2017 since the prevalent detection techniques are not capable of detecting a wide range of precursors due to inadequate sensitivities and the unavailability of reference standards pan et al 2019 further studies must adopt the total oxidisable precursors assay topa technique to analyse pfas al amin et al 2020 houtz et al 2018 blank samples e g field transport procedural blanks are necessary to ensure maximum accuracy liu et al 2020 houtz et al 2018 wang et al 2018b chen et al 2018 shi et al 2015 the emerging approach to evaluating pfas contamination in wastewater is to implement complementary target and nontarget analyses while the target analyses can quantify known pfas nontarget analyses are recommended to fully elucidate the types of pfas that are present in a sample including pfas that are unexpected or unknown by means of high resolution mass spectrometry hrms jacob et al 2021 while sample preservation and preparation are performed with maximum vigilance in the majority of studies sampling is often not reported in detail a special emphasis should be placed on the collection of contamination free samples as it can be critical in trace analysis of pfas feng et al 2019 concha gra√±a et al 2018 berger et al 2011 some of the essential elements of sampling were unclear from the literature such as standard deviations and limitations of sampling methods undertaken lorenzo et al 2019 hence detailing the critical aspects of sampling such as the type of sampling duration and frequency of sample collection samples procedure and duration of storage and precautions necessary to minimize background contamination would help guide future monitoring studies 3 occurrence of pfas in wwtps 3 1 global distribution of monitoring studies pfas have been monitored in wastewaters worldwide table 2 but the geographical distribution of studies conducted over the last decade is largely unequal fig 1 the majority of studies were conducted in china 31 followed by europe 30 and north america 16 whereas very limited data is currently available for other parts of the world including africa oceania or south america emissions and occurrence of pfas are expected to be higher in more urbanized and industrialized regions which is a possible rationale behind the high number of studies in china wang et al 2015c conversely lesser studies are expected for countries with lower manufacturing output such as australia where pfas issues are mostly associated with the use of imported products usage coggan et al 2019b however detection of significant amounts of pfas maximum reported concentrations of 440 ng l in influents and 560 ng l in effluents in wwtps around australian regions gallen et al 2018 together with recent developments in analytical capabilities might have triggered many recent investigations in australia table 2 at present no little information is available regarding the occurrence fate and transformation of pfas in wwtps of least developed and developing countries except china similar to other persistent organic pollutants pfas tend to move around the earth through atmospheric and or oceanic diffusion lam et al 2017 due to their long range mobility wang et al 2019c the data gaps regarding the occurrence and fate of pfas in wwtps in several parts of the world limits our understanding of their global production usage and transport although the lesser number of studies have been conducted in some countries such as south korea or germany in comparison to china or u s a larger number of wwtps 70 kwon et al 2017 ulrich et al 2016 have been surveyed in a single study for some countries hence comparison of countries based solely on the number of monitoring studies does not present a complete picture of pfas occurrence considering the variableness in conducting monitoring studies worldwide and lack of such details in many studies 3 2 pfas monitored in wwtps to date very few compounds among the vast pfas family have been monitored perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas and perfluoroalkyl sulfonates sulfonic acids pfsas largely dominate letcher et al 2020 ruan and jiang 2017 whereas there is no data for a significant proportion of pfas out of more than 4 000 pfas currently present in the global market wang et al 2017 most studies so far have focussed largely on two long chain pfas which have been used for the longest time pfos and pfoa cohen hubal 2019 the production of long chain pfas has greatly decreased in the last two decades as a consequence of voluntary initiatives e g pfoa pfos and related compounds phased out by 3m in 2000 krafft and riess 2015 national e g pfoa production ban in norway in 2013 li et al 2020 and international restrictions e g inclusion in the stockholm convention in 2009 buck et al 2011 askeland et al 2020 szabo et al 2018 however the proportional distribution of different pfas detected in wwtps worldwide indicates pfoa and pfos were monitored and found in about 70 of studies fig 2 the inability of natural environmental conditions to degrade these recalcitrant pfas blum 2015 with long half lives pfos 41 years and pfoa 92 years szabo et al 2018 olsen et al 2008 could be a possible reason for their prevalence long after phasing out from the year 2000 onwards houtz et al 2016 krafft and riess 2015 wang et al 2009 another long chain pfas pfna c9 has also been reported in more than 40 of studies after being previously detected in a wide range of consumer products and human samples kotthoff and b√ºcking 2018 an unfortunate consequence of these efforts to reduce contamination by conventional pfas is the increased production and use of shorter chain c4 c6 pfas which are now ubiquitous at relatively elevated concentrations in wwtps phong vo et al 2020 a significant proportion 40 of studies reported short chain pfas c 6 e g pfba pfbs pfhxs and pfpea with the exception of pfhxa c6 which was found in 69 of the total studies fig 2 pfhxa has been extensively used as an alternative to pfoa over the last decade which explains its increased occurrence in wwtps shan et al 2014 the detection of the above mentioned short chain pfas in wwtps is consistent with the studies reporting pfhpa pfhxa pfpea pfba and pfbs as the most widely found short chain pfas in the environment li et al 2020 and pfhxs as the most widely used compound in stain and water repellent products wang et al 2015a the danish environmental protection agency 2015 despite their pervasive occurrence in wwtps and other environmental media worldwide no regulatory measures are in place regarding short chain pfas which could be attributed to the limited knowledge about their toxic effects and human exposure pathways recent literature suggests shorter chain pfas might behave similarly in terms of persistence and bio accumulation as their longer chain counterparts ateia et al 2019b and can be equally hazardous as observed during experiments on animals sunderland et al 2019 it is noteworthy that pfhxs having similar toxicity potential as pfoa szabo et al 2018 has been proposed for inclusion as a persistent organic pollutant poprc 15 1 under the stockholm convention kotthoff and b√ºcking 2018 the relative lack of information regarding levels of short and ultra short chain pfas in wastewaters is particularly concerning as the demand for short chain pfas especially in developing countries is likely to increase their release into the environment in the coming years li et al 2020 the occurrence of precursors of pfas and their fate in wwtps is least studied which calls for future research in this field as the production of precursors of pfas outweighs that of pfcas and pfsas letcher et al 2020 pfas precursors e g ftohs are widely used for manufacturing of various products such as fabrics papers surfactants water and stain resistant products and firefighting foams lewis et al 2016 liu et al 2015 shi et al 2015 wang et al 2012 and hence eventually make their way to wwtps zhang et al 2013b where they can transform into pfaas brendel et al 2018 houtz et al 2016 recently two new side chain polymers perfluorooctane sulfonamide urethane polymer and perfluorobutane sulfonamide urethane polymer which could potentially transform into polyfluorinated sulfonamides e g fbsa and fosa and then short chain pfsas e g pfbs were reported for the first time in canadian wwtp sludge with maximum concentrations of 105 and 2 051 ng g d w respectively letcher et al 2020 perfluoroalkyl ether acids pfesas and pfecas and fluorotelomer acids ftsa and ftca are two main classes of pfas which are widely used as alternatives to conventional pfas in electroplating processing aids metal surface treatment plastics manufacturing etc wang et al 2019c wang et al 2015d and hence they are likely to be present in wwtps however very few studies have evaluated the occurrence and fate of such compounds in wwtps hence the role of wwtps as point sources of alternative pfas to the aquatic environment requires deeper investigations 3 3 concentrations of pfas in influents table 3 summarises the concentrations ng l of different pfas classes detected in the influent of wwtps across the world pfaas tend to be more abundant and present at higher concentrations in wwtps relative to other classes of pfas according to filipovic berger 2015 industrial wastes are a primary source of pfaas found in wwtp for instance gallen et al 2018 suspected a local industry to be responsible for high levels 444 ng l of pfaas found in the influent of a wwtp similarly influents receiving wastes from an electroplating industry carried elevated pfas content with short chain pfaas c4 c8 accounting for more than 60 of the total pfas jiawei et al 2019 in some studies conducted prior to 2015 pfoa concentrations were as high as 92 66 000 ng l in wwtp influents sun et al 2012 the lower levels of pfoa typically reported after 2015 3 100 ng l kim et al 2021 lorenzo et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 gallen et al 2018 houtz et al 2018 pan et al 2016 can be attributed to the united efforts undertaken to reduce the production of conventional pfas see section pfas monitored in wwtps above following pfoa pfhxa has been the second most abundant in terms of occurrence in wwtp influents dauchy et al 2017 found pfhxa at an unusually elevated concentration 4 000 ng l in the influent of a wwtp that received raw effluents from a fluorochemical manufacturing plant the technical performance of short chain pfas being lower than long chain pfas ateia et al 2019b larger quantities of short chain pfhxa are typically required to achieve similar performance as long chain pfoa this in turn can lead to the massive production and abundance of pfhxa shan et al 2014 more studies elucidating the reason behind such a high prevalence of pfhxa and tracking its sources to wwtps are needed in addition to short c6 c4 and long c 6 chain pfaas pfsas c9 c4 have also been detected at significant levels up to 1 500 ng l in wwtp influents table 3 the abundance of pfos in domestic wastes chen et al 2012 and the use of pfbs as an alternative to conventional pfas liang and chang 2019 have been stated earlier studies regarding ultrashort c2 c3 chain pfas in wwtps are scarce which could be attributed to the difficulty in analysing three or fewer carbon pfas see the section on sampling and analysis bj√∂rnsdotter et al 2019 confirmed the presence of tfa c2 and pfpra c3 at concentrations as high as 14 000 and 53 000 ng l in landfill leachates and groundwater samples respectively another study in china detected pfpra 17 ng l in the influent of a wwtp zhang et al 2015 these findings highlight the need for a further investigation of wwtps as potential sources of such ultrashort chain pfas to groundwater and or landfills precursors of prevalent pfas have been found at elevated concentrations in influents of some wwtps table 3 unlike pfaas the precursors concentrations systematically decreased from influent to effluent dauchy et al 2017 houtz et al 2018 probably due to their transformation into pfas or other compounds during treatment chen et al 2017b in some cases the precursors were reported in the influent but not in the effluent for instance houtz et al 2018 for the first time reported two new classes of fluorotelomer thioether surfactants ftshcs and fluorotelomer thioether alkylamido hydroxyl carboxylate ftsahcs in the influent but did not find those in the effluent other new pfas e g 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonamide alkylbetaine 6 2 ftab and 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonamide propyl n n dimethylamine m4 have been reported at high concentrations table 3 in influent of a wwtp receiving effluent from a fluorochemical manufacturing facility dauchy et al 2017 thus more monitoring studies involving new classes of pfas and their precursors are recommended to understand their occurrence and fate in wwtps most monitoring studies conducted to date have focused on the occurrence of pfas in the effluents than in influents of wwtps however more work on pfas in the influents could add to the existing knowledge about the source of newly discovered precursors to influents 3 4 concentrations of pfas in effluents knowing the levels of pfas in the effluents of a wwtp allows characterisation of the discharge into the environment effluents with comparatively lesser background matrix effect are easier to analyse than influents this could be a possible reason behind the availability of more data on pfas in effluents than in influents table 3 high levels 1 100 ng l of pfas has been detected in the effluents of wwtps receiving wastes from industries castiglioni et al 2015 wwtp effluents are significant point sources of pfas to various environmental matrices which receive wastewaters either through direct discharge surface and coastal water or application of recycled wastewaters groundwaters soils and vegetation elmoznino et al 2018 found wwtp effluent in the long island south usa to be a source of pfaas to major tributary rivers similarly a study conducted in the state of washington usa suspected the effluent about 200 ng l of pfaas from a wwtp as the source of contamination to the surface water downstream furl et al 2011 inadequate removal or rather elevated levels of pfas in the effluents has been observed in most of the studies table 3 for instance in a recent study shigei et al 2020 noticed that the combined concentration of three pfas i e pfpea pfoa and pfna increased six times from influent to effluent similarly the concentrations of short chain pfas such as pfba pfpea and pfhxa are often larger in the effluent than in the influent lorenzo et al 2019 houtz et al 2018 gallen et al 2018 filipovic et al 2015 arvaniti et al 2012 which is much likely due to the degradation of precursors into recalcitrant shorter chain pfas chen et al 2017b on the other hand the concentration of longer chain pfas c 9 and precursors in the effluent decreased for some cases which could be due to their sorption onto activated sludge zhou et al 2019 sun et al 2012 and or degradation to short chain pfaas zhang et al 2015 houtz et al 2018 suggested adsorption onto sludge and or degradation to be responsible for the absence of novel pfas precursors ftshcs and ftsahcs in the effluent in spite of their detection in the influent another study reported high removal 80 for two new fluorotelomer compounds 6 2 ftab and m4 in the final effluent after treatment dauchy et al 2017 the actual reason behind the substantial elimination of such newly found pfas in effluents is unclear and needs further research however an exception was observed in the case of a pfas precursor 6 2 fts whose concentration doubled after treatment houtz et al 2018 emerging pfas such as the ones mentioned above have comparable levels of residue as their longer chain counterparts and can potentially cause similar impacts as long chain pfas ruan and jiang 2017 hence in depth investigation of newly discovered precursors and fluorinated compounds in terms of their occurrence and fate in wwtp would be helpful in better understanding such contradictory observations 3 5 pfas in biosolids the occurrence of pfas in biosolids and its consequences are often overlooked letcher et al 2020 although biosolids and sludge from secondary treatment are notable routes for pfas emission into the environment e g groundwater soil vegetation etc ebrahimi et al 2021 stoiber et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 pfcas pfsas precursors e g ftohs guerra et al 2014 and novel fluorinated polymers letcher et al 2020 have been detected in biosolids worldwide including north america europe africa asia and australia moodie et al 2021 a recent study in australia reported significant levels of pfas up to 910 ng g in biosolids moodie et al 2021 despite the usage of imported products rather than pfas using manufacturing industries being predominantly responsible for the generation of pfas wastes coggan et al 2019b regulating various operational parameters e g solid retention time temperature and solution chemistry e g ph have shown to reduce the pfas loads in the effluent due to enhanced partitioning of pfas into sludge ebrahimi et al 2021 zhang et al 2013 section 4 1 however these techniques result in the accumulation of pfas in biosolids which could eventually leach into the environment rodr√≠guez varela et al 2021 moodie et al 2021 guerra et al 2014 further research indicating the effects of various process parameters on the leaching and or release of pfas from biosolids into the environment is required pfas enriched biosolids are disposed to landfills stoiber et al 2020 fuertes et al 2017 which could be responsible for the abundance of pfas 10 to 416 000 ng l including short and ultra short chain compounds bj√∂rnsdotter et al 2019 in landfill leachates throughout the world hamid et al 2018 concerns regarding the long term release of pfas from solid waste disposal facilities and associated risks are emerging due to observed emissions of pfas from landfills into various environmental matrices wang et al 2020a while incineration of pfas loaded wastes and evaporation of volatile pfas primarily precursors e g ftohs can discharge pfas including harmful fluorinated greenhouse gases into the atmosphere stoiber et al 2020 wang et al 2020a hamid et al 2018 leaching of pfas can contaminate the groundwater and soil moodie et al 2021 stoiber et al 2020 the potential of commercial landfills to release pfas into the air water and soil require immediate attention moreover treating landfill leachates through wwtps is widely practised stoiber et al 2020 hence pfas could be just transferring between wastewater and solid waste treatment facilities rather than getting removed from the environment and hence more research is needed in this field 4 removal of pfas through wastewater remediation techniques the type of treatment and the physicochemical characteristics of pfas significantly affect their removal efficiencies and composition kibambe et al 2020 ateia et al 2019b chen et al 2018 rahman et al 2014 table 4 summarizes the various treatment techniques and their effectiveness for the removal of pfas from wastewater along with the effect of the background matrix a drastic increase in the concentrations of pfas from influent to effluent has been observed in many studies table 3 and is discussed in more detail in the following section 4 1 full scale treatment 4 1 1 conventional wwtps overview very few studies have investigated the levels of pfas at various stages of a wwtp kibambe et al 2020 wang et al 2019a zhou et al 2019 the design capacity and operating conditions such as hydraulic and sludge retention time feed concentrations temperature flow rate and mixed liquor suspended solids decide the fate of pfas in a wwtp kibambe et al 2020 for instance longer retention time and higher temperature led to the formation of pfaas which increased their levels in the effluent guerra et al 2014 on the other hand unique operating parameters of higher mixed liquor suspended solids 5 000 mg l and longer sludge retention time 45 days enhanced the removal of pfas from the aqueous phase significantly in a wwtp using recirculation of activated sludge kibambe et al 2020 other factors such as the source of wastewaters domestic industrial urban runoff and or agricultural climatic conditions and atmospheric depositions influenced the concentrations of different pfas and their removal from the aqueous phase in wwtps ratola et al 2012 along with process and external factors the type of pfas is also crucial for example pfaas the most abundant class of pfas which are usually present in anionic forms are non volatile and recalcitrant to biodegradation ateia et al 2019b whereas neutral pfas which are mainly precursors such as ftohs and perfluoroalkyl sulfonamidoethanols are volatile and semi volatile wang et al 2021 ateia et al 2019b hamid et al 2018 and hence can be released into the atmosphere from wwtps fuertes et al 2017 to date the knowledge regarding the emission of volatile and or semi volatile pfas from wwtps into the atmosphere and the impact of various treatment processes is limited due to the complex wastewater matrix biological and physicochemical reactions and the unique properties of pfas wwtps directly or indirectly serve as either source or sink for various pfas chen et al 2018 hence the efficiency of different treatment processes in removing pfas and their formation in wwtps needs further study 4 1 2 adsorption in general adsorption and biodegradation are the two processes responsible for the removal of contaminants from the aqueous phase in wwtps however pfas long short ultra short chain and other new alternate pfas are least susceptible to biodegradation due to the strong c f bond 513 10 kj mol 1 rodr√≠guez varela et al 2021 and hence adsorption onto sludge is the primary mechanism for their removal from the aqueous phase in wwtps kibambe et al 2020 the distribution coefficient kd is an important parameter to evaluate the distribution of pfas between sludge adsorption onto sludge and wastewater dissolved phase during wastewater treatment li et al 2021 factors like ph and composition of the wastewater and the structure of pfas influences the partitioning of pfas wang et al 2020b for example with a decrease in ph 9 to 2 the pfas partitioning to sludge intensified resulting in increased sorption onto sludge in acidic conditions ebrahimi et al 2021 the chemical structure of pfas especially the length of the carbon chain dictates the partition behaviour of that pfas between liquid and solid phases mussabek et al 2019 for instance the hexagonal ring structure of perfluoroethylcyclohexane sulfonate was associated with enhanced adsorption onto sediments liu et al 2019b while the ether bonds present in adona was detrimental for its adsorption onto suspended particles sun et al 2016 studies suggest short chain pfas tend to partition to aqueous phase while long chain pfas partitions to the solid phase in the aquatic environment coggan et al 2019b a similar trend was observed in wwtps where partitioning of pfaas to sludge increased with an increase in chain length li et al 2021 mussabek et al 2019 coggan et al 2019b pan et al 2016 owing to the strong affinity of hydrophobic compounds to organic matter li et al 2021 moreover the type of functional group in a pfaas also influences its adsorption onto sludge wang et al 2015a found the kd of pfhxs to be higher than that of pfhpa suggesting a stronger affinity of more acidic sulfonate group towards organic content in the sludge than that of carboxylate groups arvaniti et al 2014 chen et al 2012 further studies utilizing kd for understanding the effect of pfas structure on its adsorption onto sludge could generate new insights very few studies have investigated the influence of pfas headgroup charge anionic cationic and zwitterionic on its partitioning at liquid liquid and solid liquid interfaces ebrahimi et al 2021 xiao et al 2019 brusseau van glubt 2019 while most pfas being anionic are partitioned to the sludge through hydrophobic and or london van der waals interactions cationic and zwitterionic compounds may be electrostatically attracted to negatively charged sites in the sludge along with other forces mentioned above xiao et al 2019 the organic and inorganic matter present in wastewater is also crucial for predicting the partitioning behaviour of pfas ebrahimi et al 2021 in wastewater sludge system which is discussed in later sections 4 2 1 1 and 4 2 1 2 as controlling the pfas loads to influent may be gradual and is not a viable option at present optimization of the process parameters such as maintenance of lower ph and monitoring and regulating organic and inorganic fractions in wastewater to enhance pfas partitioning to sludge could be beneficial the partition behaviour of pfas between water and solids e g sediments suspended particles and soils have been studied more in coastal surface and groundwater systems wang et al 2020b lee et al 2020 liu et al 2019ab mussabek et al 2019 li et al 2019 dong et al 2018 in comparison to wastewater and sludge in wwtps ebrahimi et al 2021 li et al 2021 wang et al 2015a coggan et al 2019b in addition most of the previous studies have focused on the two legacy pfas i e pfoa and pfos liu et al 2019b insights on the partition behaviour of short ultra short chain and precursor pfas between sludge wastewater and effects of treatment type on their partition are insufficient further studies on kd of sludge wastewater systems can provide a better understanding of the fate bioaccumulation adsorption mechanism and transport of pfas during and after treatment 4 1 3 transformation biological remediation techniques e g aerobic anaerobic digestion biological filtration applied during wastewater treatment influence the transformation of pfas precursors in wwtps which ultimately affects the concentrations of pfas in effluents chen et al 2012 while typical wwtp may remove longer chain pfaas from wastewater as a result of their adsorption onto sludge shorter chain pfas are formed during treatment houtz et al 2016 guerra et al 2014 short chain pfas are more persistent than their long chain counterparts resulting in longer term occurrence li et al 2020 therefore future studies should focus on the effective remediation of shorter chain pfas from wastewaters using cost effective robust techniques with practical applicability numerous studies have reported the formation of pfaas after secondary stage especially anaerobic anoxic oxic oxidation treatment table 3 wang et al 2019a zhou et al 2019 houtz et al 2018 chen et al 2012 ftohs and fluorotelomer sulfonates fts constitute a significant class of pfas precursor compounds that can degrade into perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas c 4 when undergoing aerobic and anaerobic treatment hamid et al 2020a hamid et al 2020b zhou et al 2019 coggan et al 2019b chen et al 2018 hamid et al 2018 liu et al 2015 biodegradation of ftohs to pfcas through microbes has been well studied in laboratories chen et al 2017b fluorotelomer carboxylic acids ftcas and unsaturated fluorotelomer carboxylic acids ftcuas are other intermediary compounds derived from fluorotelomer precursors of pfas which can eventually lead to the formation of pfaas as end products hamid et al 2018 the transformation of pfas precursors to product pfas in wwtps is shown in table 5 while many studies have revealed the transformation of pfas precursors into perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas c 4 the ability of precursors to transform into ultrashort chain pfcas c2 c3 remains unexplored a few studies suggested that ultrashort chain pfcas e g trifluoroacetic acid tfa and perfluoropropionic acid pfpra are usually generated at fluoropolymer manufacturing industries chen et al 2019 but overall knowledge regarding the degradation of ultra short chain pfas from their respective precursors in wwtps is limited a significant rise in the levels of pfas for wwtps applying biological deodorization to raw influent wang et al 2019b enunciates the need for evaluating the effect of specific microorganisms used for deodorization methods which caused 70 increase in the concentrations of pfas aerobic treatment also has the potential to degrade pfas precursors zhang et al 2013b which was confirmed by guerra et al 2014 who observed high levels of pfaas in the secondary sludge of a wwtp adopting aerobic oxidation zhang et al 2015 also reported a significant increase of pfas in the final effluent of a wwtp using sequencing batch reactor system overall pfas precursors transformation to pfaas was prominent in wwtps applying biological treatment methods houtz et al 2018 which are likely to break only the c c bond resulting in the formation of shorter chain pfas gagliano et al 2020 the weaker adsorption of pfas onto primary sludge than secondary sludge could be due to the hindrance from background ions see section 4 2 1 2 the enhanced transformation of pfas precursors during biological treatment could also be responsible for the higher detection of pfas in the final effluent after secondary treatment zhang et al 2015 microorganisms could gain energy for their growth from thermodynamically favoured reductive defluorination arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 provided strong electron donors are available to facilitate such reactions thus future studies should focus on the performance of anaerobic microorganisms capable of degrading pfas the efficiency of biological filters in removing pfas from wastewater is dependent on various parameters such as sludge age and thickness biological filters are inefficient in removing short chain pfas c 6 from wastewater observed removal efficiencies of about 60 for pfoa and 20 for pfaas c 6 by biological filtration confirmed the inability of microbial degradation to remove shorter chain pfas kibambe et al 2020 when thickened the biofilm can act as both aerobic outer layer and anaerobic inner layer which could be possibly influencing pfas rejection kibambe et al 2020 biological activated carbon filters using granular activated carbon gac perform more efficiently than biological filters in pfaas removal from wastewater due to the strong ability of gac to adsorb pfaas c 7 pramanik et al 2017 though biological filters biological activated carbon filters showed considerable removal for pfaas 50 kibambe et al 2020 wang et al 2019a activated sludge treatment outperformed both with 90 removal efficiency kibambe et al 2020 castiglioni et al 2015 further investigation to understand the effects of different biological treatments on the fate of pfas precursors long chain short chain and ultra short chain pfas are necessary for drawing tangible inferences in addition to wwtps landfills are also important sites where pfas precursors can transform into pfas the biotic conditions prevailing at landfills and subsequent biochemical treatment of landfill leachates are favourable for this transformation to occur hamid et al 2020a sun et al 2020 wang et al 2020a discharging leachates into wwtps and dumping wwtp sludge in landfills are common practices which may contribute towards pfas levels in both media seo et al 2019 hamid et al 2018 to our knowledge there are no insights available on this interrelation to date which requires further investigation 4 2 lab scale investigations 4 2 1 adsorption among all the processes explored for the remediation of pfas from wastewater adsorption is the most studied at the laboratory scale table 4 adsorption using ion exchange resins has shown promising results with 99 removal efficiency for pfas along with dissolved organics 90 dixit et al 2021 dixit et al 2020a however results obtained at high initial concentrations 5 1 000 mg l of pfas in synthetic and spiked wastewaters are not necessarily applicable to lower and more realistic concentrations 1 000 ng l the formation of nitrosamine precursors during regenerating amine based anion exchange ix resins documented earlier is also concerning flowers and singer 2013 biochar on the other hand successfully removed pfas at a lower concentration 1 000 ng l inyang and dickenson 2017 biochar filtration post secondary treatment after removal of most of the organic matter could facilitate the removal of pfas through adsorption dalahmeh et al 2019 modification of biochar surfaces to improve pfas adsorption especially for short chain pfas should also be further studied other novel adsorbents such as hydrogel polymers and magnetic fluorinated adsorbents showed excellent results in minimum time 2 4 h ateia et al 2019a du et al 2017 however the applicability of these adsorbents at large scale treatment facilities with lower concentrations of pfas and complex background matrix needs to be confirmed 4 2 1 1 role of pfas carbon chain length to date the effect of alkyl chain length on pfas adsorption have been investigated mostly with activated carbon biochars and resins in aqueous and or synthetic wastewater solutions gagliano et al 2020 hydrophobic interactions have been found to be the most prominent mechanism responsible for the adsorption of pfas onto various adsorbents ateia et al 2019a dalahmeh et al 2019 du et al 2014 hydrophobicity of perfluoroalkyl compounds in turn depends on the length of the carbon chain with an increase in the length of the carbon chain from c5 c15 the hydrophobicity and hence their adsorption onto sludge increases zhang et al 2013a shorter chain pfas being less hydrophobic and more water soluble are less likely to get adsorbed onto the sludge in wwtps brendel et al 2018 zhang et al 2013a hence the length of the carbon chain of a pfas plays a crucial role in the adsorption behaviour of that compound as wastewater has a different composition organic and inorganic matter from other aquatic matrices e g surface coastal and or groundwater phong vo et al 2020 pfas interacts differently with adsorbents in wastewater hence more studies are required to understand the role of chain length during adsorption of pfas onto sludge in wastewater matrix the interaction by short and long chain pfas with sludge has been studied using activated carbons and polymers which suggest short chain pfas interact with organic matter through electrostatic repulsions dalahmeh et al 2019 and pore blockage while long chain pfas tend to have hydrophobic interactions gagliano et al 2020 since organic matter constitutes a major fraction of sludge the adsorption mechanism between short ultra short chain pfas and sludge could be studied further as discussed in 4 1 2 4 2 1 2 role of background matrices earlier reviews have discussed in detail the interaction between inorganic and organic ions and organic contaminants kah et al 2017 the organic matter e g proteins lipids carboxylic and amino acids natural and or dissolved organic matter gagliano et al 2020 present in wastewater ebrahimi et al 2021 liu et al 2020 impact the adsorption of pfas onto sludge in wwtps zhang et al 2019 only a few studies have investigated the role of organic ions on pfas removal among which most are concentrated on the effect of humic and fulvic acids banks et al 2020 and least is known about the impact of dissolved organic matter on pfas removal from wastewater dixit et al 2020b found organic matter natural organic matter humic acid and fulvic acid from surface water had a negative impact 55 decrease in adsorption capacity on the adsorption of pfas using ion exchange ix resins as organic ions caused blockage of pores through diffusion and competed with pfas for adsorption sites dixit et al 2021 dixit et al 2019 on the contrary wang et al 2015a found that the adsorption of pfas to sludge reduced significantly after the removal of organic matter from the sludge through thermal treatment hence the authors suggested that pfas has a higher affinity for sludge from secondary treatment with higher biomass zhang et al 2013a observed that protein in the sludge had a positive effect on the adsorption of pfas and deduced that certain amide groups present in proteins could possibly be aiding the adsorption of pfas onto sludge while another study found protein in the wastewater influent led to lower removal of pfos and pfoa pramanik et al 2017 similar to organic ions inorganic ions can have both positive and negative effects on the adsorption of pfas kah et al 2020 banks et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 divalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 can form cation bridge between the negatively charged pfas and sludge thereby improving adsorption zhang et al 2013a in contrast monovalent cations present in wastewater such as na have been found to hinder the adsorption of pfas arvaniti et al 2014 anions such as so4 2 po4 3 no3 cl and cro4 strongly compete with pfas for adsorption sites dixit et al 2021 ateia et al 2019a thereby interfering with the adsorption of pfas on sludge deng et al 2010 ateia et al 2019a observed a rapid decrease 10 20 in the adsorption of short chain pfcas with an increase in anion concentrations whereas high background anions in the real wastewater matrix caused the salting out effect which compensated the hindrance by so4 2 by reducing the solubility of pfas du et al 2015 such conflicting observations in terms of the effect of organic and inorganic ions on the treatment of pfas in wastewater table 4 generates scope for more research on the impacts of different types of organic compounds and inorganic ions cations and anions on the removal of short chain pfas and precursors at environmentally relevant concentrations 1 000 ng l ateia et al 2019a further the effect of co existing pfas in the presence of background ions is yet to be explored indeed the rate of adsorption decreased significantly when three pfcas c6 c7 and c8 were treated simultaneously in wastewater with resins which was attributed to the competitive adsorption between short and long chain pfas du et al 2015 to date most studies have investigated the effects of organic and inorganic ions separately on individual pfas in aqueous solutions at concentrations not relevant to the environment outcomes of the simultaneous effects of various organic and inorganic ions on the removal of co existing short chain c4 pfas and or precursors would be relevant for real world conditions further the chemical interactions between various ions and pfas leading to the differences in adsorption behaviour could provide useful mechanistic insights 4 2 2 other treatment techniques advanced treatment processes like adsorption electrochemical degradation nanofiltration and reverse osmosis dixit et al 2020a ateia et al 2019a wang et al 2019b soriano et al 2017 are comparatively more effective than conventional processes kibambe et al 2020 wang et al 2019a in terms of pfas removal for example a wwtp based on conventional treatment showed negative removal 27 for pfas whereas a wwtp using advanced treatment reverse osmosis achieved 86 removal tabtong et al 2015 similarly a membrane bioreactor system was found to be more effective in removing long chain pfcas than conventional activated sludge treatment pan et al 2016 however it is noteworthy that some treatments like ozonation uv chlorination and sand filtration have been found ineffective in removing pfas gagliano et al 2020 pan et al 2016 nanofiltration nf has been efficient 98 in removing pfas along with dissolved organic carbon and mineral hardness from drinking water franke et al 2021 the efficiency of nf in removing pfas while simultaneously achieving other water quality targets in wastewater needs validation by further studies a study that conducted nf followed by electrochemical degradation could achieve 99 removal of c6 pfaa in less than 3 h for pfas concentrations 1 000 mg l soriano et al 2017 similarly electrochemical treatment processes using electrodes like boron doped diamond anode and stainless steel cathode could achieve 95 degradation of pfas with high and low initial concentrations of 1 642 ¬µg l gomez ruiz et al 2017 and 62 ng l wang et al 2019b within 10 h hence the application of electrochemistry for degradation of short chain pfas and pfas precursors at lower concentrations could be explored more rather than combining it with other techniques treatment trains should involve processes that are not efficient individually while their combined efficiency is higher in terms of pfas removal along with the ease of operation and cost effectiveness for instance ozonation wang et al 2019b and photocatalysis lopes da silva et al 2017 were ineffective in removing pfaas from wastewater matrix individually while the combination of ozonation and photocatalysis led to the degradation of pfas as the reactions between oh and pfaas precursors can initiate degradation reactions forming recalcitrant shorter chain pfas wang et al 2019a wang et al 2018a huang et al 2016 similarly efficient treatment 98 of pfas from drinking water using nf followed by subsequent adsorption of pfas 85 99 from nf concentrate franke et al 2021 calls for more study using such treatment train practices for effective remediation of pfas in wastewaters another unique aerosol based separation technique for remediation of precursor 6 2 ftsa achieved 100 removal within 1 h ebersbach et al 2016 however the initial concentration of the spiked pfas in wastewater was unrealistically high 10 mg l which is one common limitation in experimental studies published to date table 4 more experimental data carried out at realistic concentrations 1 000 ng l li et al 2020 and involving short chain pfas c 4 and matrix effects are needed the knowledge regarding the treatment of pfas precursors from wastewater at environmentally relevant concentrations is also limited 5 conclusions and research recommendations 5 1 conclusions the lack of monitoring data from many parts of the world limits our understanding of the global distribution of pfas the inaccessibility of advanced analytical facilities and the need to meet more pressing wastewater quality issues in many developing countries could be responsible for the dearth of pfas monitoring studies in these regions ultra short chain pfas precursors of pfas and new generation replacements of conventional pfas are understudied which could be attributed to their analytical method limitations and the complexity of topa and non target analysis the relative ease of pfas analysis in effluents having lower background interference than in influents could be responsible for fewer studies of pfas in influents than effluents the partitioning of longer chain pfas to sludge and the transformation of precursors to shorter chain pfaas during biological treatment influence the concentrations of pfas in the sludge and the effluents the release of volatile compounds is a possible route for the transfer of precursors from wastewater to air and remains unexplored currently while most studies monitored the removal of pfas from the aqueous phase effluents their fate after partitioning to sludge and or biosolids is relatively unexplored which compels us to think if the mere shifting of pfas loads from one phase to the other has been misunderstood as removal to date 5 2 research recommendations the limited information about pfas levels in developing and least developed countries necessitates future studies in these regions to date no study has critically reviewed the sampling procedures despite it being critical in monitoring pfas considering the high risk of background contamination monitoring ultra short chain pfas precursors of pfas and new generation pfas in wastewater and studying their transformation pathways is required as some of these compounds can exhibit similar persistence and bioaccumulating capabilities as their longer chain counterparts more monitoring data for pfas in the influents could add to the existing knowledge about the sources of short chain pfas and newly discovered pfas precursors in wwtps while adequate studies reveal pfas precursors transformation into perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas c 4 the likelihood of precursors to transform into ultrashort chain pfcas c2 c3 remains unexplored investigating the degradability e g biodegradation photodegradation ozonation etc of synthetic precursor compounds at a laboratory scale could help better understand the mechanisms responsible for their transformations and effective treatments the effects of different biological treatments especially the effects of aerobic and anaerobic microbes on pfas precursors transformation to pfaas need to be explored the reported rise in the levels of pfas after the application of biological deodorization in wwtps necessitates studying the effects of specific microorganisms used for the deodorization process more mass balance studies of pfas and their precursors in wwtps accounting for masses in all three phases are advised as their removal reported in wwtps so far could be simply the result of a transfer of mass load from one phase to another within a wwtp the common practice of discharging landfill leachates into wwtps and dumping wwtp sludge and or biosolids in landfills necessitates studying the fate of pfas throughout such interconnected systems the combined effects of various organic e g humic and fulvic substances lipids and proteins and natural and or dissolved organic matter and inorganic ions cations anions and zwitterions on the removal of co existing short chain pfas and precursors need further studies due to the real world implications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
16956,poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfas comprise more than 4 000 anthropogenically manufactured compounds with widescale consumer and industrial applications this critical review compiles the latest information on the worldwide distribution of pfas and evaluates their fate in wastewater treatment plants wwtps a large proportion 30 of monitoring studies in wwtps were conducted in china followed by europe 30 and north america 16 whereas information is generally lacking for other parts of the world including most of the developing countries short and long chain perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas were widely detected in both the influents up to 1 000 ng l and effluents 15 to 1 500 ng l of wwtps to date limited data is available regarding levels of pfas precursors and ultra short chain pfas in wwtps most wwtps exhibited low removal efficiencies for pfas and many studies reported an increase in the levels of pfaas after wastewater treatment the analysis of the fate of various classes of pfas at different wastewater treatment stages aerobic and aerobic biodegradation photodegradation and chemical degradation revealed biodegradation as the primary mechanism responsible for the transformation of pfas precursors to pfaas in wwtps remediation studies at full scale and laboratory scale suggest advanced processes such as adsorption using ion exchange resins electrochemical degradation and nanofiltration are more effective in removing pfas 95 100 than conventional processes however the applicability of such treatments for real world wwtps faces significant challenges due to the scaling up requirements mass transfer limitations and management of treatment by products and wastes combining more than one technique for effective removal of pfas while addressing limitations of the individual treatments could be beneficial considering environmental concentrations of pfas cost effectiveness and ease of operation nanofiltration followed by adsorption using wood derived biochar and or activated carbons could be a viable option if introduced to conventional treatment systems however the large scale applicability of the same needs to be further verified graphical

used in various industrial and commercial products from the mid twentieth century wang et al 2017 comprised of a hydrophobic fluorinated alkyl chain at one end and a hydrophilic functional group at the other arvaniti et al 2014 pfas cnf2n 1 r r functional group meng et al 2020 buck et al 2011 have high thermal and chemical stability owing to the strong c f bonds mulabagal et al 2018 this unique combination of physical and chemical properties along with the hydrophobic and lipophobic moieties make pfas extremely suitable as water and oil repellants and friction resistants kwiatkowski et al 2020 due to the desired performance and production suitability pfas are manufactured massively for wide scale industrial manufacturing of paper textiles pesticides leather medical aids oil and minerals metal plating etc and consumer applications food packaging cosmetics and personal care products paints inks non stick cooking utensils surfactants firefighting foams and several other waterproof products gagliano et al 2020 ji et al 2020 wang et al 2017 lu et al 2017 kotthoff et al 2015 the general purpose of treating consumer products with pfas is to impart an extended service life and durability this practice in turn results in prolonged exposure of humans wildlife and the environment to pfas herzke et al 2012 although pfas have been used widely since the 1950s it was only after the first report of pfas in wildlife and human serum in the early 2000s that scientific studies on the properties occurrence environmental fate and health effects of pfas accelerated cousins 2015 over the past few decades pfas have been widely detected in the environment nakayama et al 2019 and they are ubiquitous in almost all aquatic matrices such as drinking water surface water groundwater and coastal water wei et al 2018 humans can be exposed to pfas through drinking water and dietary intake domingo nadal 2019 sunderland et al 2019 wei et al 2018 studies have reported that several acute as well as chronic human diseases such as thyroid asthma anxiety obesity pediatric allergies hyperuricemia peroxisome proliferation immune toxicity kidney disorders liver damage and cardiovascular diseases may be associated with pfas exposure ruan et al 2019 jian et al 2017 suja et al 2009 other studies have demonstrated toxic effects such as immunotoxicity carcinogenicity and hormonal disorders of some perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas on animals poothong et al 2020 rand mabury 2017 today more than 4 000 pfas are manufactured and used worldwide including both conventional e g pfoa and pfos and alternative pfas short chain pfas and newly identified fluorinated replacements of conventional pfas pan et al 2019 anticipating long term exposure effects due to their persistent and bio accumulative nature ateia et al 2019a wang et al 2016 conventional pfas were voluntarily phased out wang et al 2014b krafft riess 2015 due to regulations e g us epa drinking water guideline for pfoa and pfos 70 ng l li et al 2020 ateia et al 2019b pan et al 2019 still many studies have reported high levels of conventional pfas in wwtp effluents 100 ng l table 2 and 3 alternative pfas have also been detected abundantly in wwtps by several studies with concentrations up to some hundred ng l table 2 and 3 short chain pfas being highly mobile are detected in all ecosystems brendel et al 2018 and can be equally toxic as their longer chain counterparts li et al 2020 the occurrence of pfas in wwtps has been reviewed earlier by arvaniti stasinakis 2015 however more than 100 new monitoring studies have been published since 2015 some involve aspects not covered earlier such as the effect of different treatment stages of a wwtp on removal efficiencies and the transformation of pfas precursors to perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas during wastewater treatment that allows a better understanding of the fate of pfas in wwtps overall this article aims at providing a systematic overview of the up to date knowledge on the occurrence fate transformation and removal of pfas in wwtps first the sampling and analysis methods adopted in monitoring studies are discussed followed by the global occurrence data of different types of pfas in the influents and effluents of wwtps the removal efficiencies and mechanisms are then discussed in detail emphasising the fate of pfas in a full scale treatment plant and the transformation of pfas precursors during treatment this comprehensive review on the levels and fate of conventional and alternative pfas in wwtps along with their removal at different scales allows the identification of research gaps those are compiled in the last section along with suggestions for future research concerning alternative pfas especially ultra short chain pfas and pfas precursors transformation mechanism of pfas precursors and large scale applications of laboratory tested pfas treatment techniques 2 sampling and analysis measuring pfas at environmentally relevant concentrations ng l comes with a series of associated challenges from sampling to analysis the sampling laboratory and analytical components e g sample collection equipment and containers laboratory consumables analytical grade water and solvents sample preparation and analytical instruments can potentially cause background interference owing to the ubiquitous presence of pfas al amin et al 2020 misa and kennedy 2018 table 1 summarizes the commonly practised sampling and analytical procedures applied when monitoring pfas in wastewaters ideally glass and fluoropolymer containers should be strictly avoided while collecting and storing samples lath et al 2019 this is because of the tendency of pfas to adsorb onto glass surface tian and sun 2019 and contamination from fluoropolymer e g ptfe polytetrafluoroethylene containers chen et al 2018 may result in inaccurate analysis while recent studies have mostly used either polypropylene or high density polyethylene hdpe bottles for the collection of samples table 1 the consequences of using glass containers on quantification remain ambiguous kibambe et al 2020 nakayama et al 2019 ciofi et al 2018 cleaning all the sampling equipment and containers with tap water followed by triple rinsing with ultra pure water and methanol can reduce background contamination elmoznino et al 2018 it is essential to carefully consider the variableness for a wwtp e g diurnal seasonal and representativeness of a sample without which the evaluation of pfas is of the least value liu et al 2020 gallen et al 2018 berger et al 2011 many recent studies have relied on composite sampling for observing the presence of pfas in wwtps table 3 grab samples wang et al 2020c elmoznino et al 2018 could be considered less representative as they fail to take into account the diurnal variations in wastewater flow and may not be apt to understand the diversity in pfas quality and quantity during the treatment though acidification kibambe et al 2020 nguyen et al 2019 and refrigeration zhou et al 2019 dauchy et al 2017 of biologically active samples such as wastewater and sludge can reduce the biodegradation potential of pfas precursors tian and sun 2019 the excess protons in acidic water could lead to the adsorption of pfas onto the container surface upon acidification ateia et al 2019b most studies refrigerated samples at 4 c table 1 as recommended by standard methods epa 537 1 2018 d 7979 19 2019 to ensure the preservation of target pfas until analysis the typically low concentrations of pfas in wastewater table 3 along with the high levels of organic matter and inorganic salts may result in inaccurate quantification of the target compounds liu et al 2020 al amin et al 2020 huset et al 2011 hence clean up and concentration of wastewater are vital steps prior to pfas analysis despite the capability of glass fibre cellulose acetate nylon etc to adsorb or release pfas tian and sun 2019 filtration using glass fibres prior to extraction is often applied table 1 as polypropylene filters can also retain long chain pfas elmoznino et al 2018 future studies could rely on centrifugation for pre cleaning wastewaters table 1 at present solid phase extraction spe using weak anion exchange wax adsorbents is the primary sample clean up approach for wastewater matrices table 1 and table 4 as wax cartridges have shown better recoveries for short chain pfas than other polymeric cartridges such as hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb pan et al 2019 mullin et al 2019 hopkins et al 2018 taniyasu et al 2005 analytical sensitivities using direct injection has greatly improved over the last few years 1 ng l which can overcome the contamination risks associated with sample manipulation during spe nakayama et al 2019 ciofi et al 2018 most studies have used ultra high performance liquid chromatography to analyse pfas with the mass spectroscopy usually operated in negative electron ionisation mode as most target pfas are anionic nakayama et al 2019 while the predominantly used reversed phase chromatography columns work well for most anionic pfas separation of highly polar short chain pfas especially ultra short chain c 4 is challenging tian and sun 2019 due to their higher solubility and poor retainability yeung et al 2017 since the prevalent detection techniques are not capable of detecting a wide range of precursors due to inadequate sensitivities and the unavailability of reference standards pan et al 2019 further studies must adopt the total oxidisable precursors assay topa technique to analyse pfas al amin et al 2020 houtz et al 2018 blank samples e g field transport procedural blanks are necessary to ensure maximum accuracy liu et al 2020 houtz et al 2018 wang et al 2018b chen et al 2018 shi et al 2015 the emerging approach to evaluating pfas contamination in wastewater is to implement complementary target and nontarget analyses while the target analyses can quantify known pfas nontarget analyses are recommended to fully elucidate the types of pfas that are present in a sample including pfas that are unexpected or unknown by means of high resolution mass spectrometry hrms jacob et al 2021 while sample preservation and preparation are performed with maximum vigilance in the majority of studies sampling is often not reported in detail a special emphasis should be placed on the collection of contamination free samples as it can be critical in trace analysis of pfas feng et al 2019 concha gra√±a et al 2018 berger et al 2011 some of the essential elements of sampling were unclear from the literature such as standard deviations and limitations of sampling methods undertaken lorenzo et al 2019 hence detailing the critical aspects of sampling such as the type of sampling duration and frequency of sample collection samples procedure and duration of storage and precautions necessary to minimize background contamination would help guide future monitoring studies 3 occurrence of pfas in wwtps 3 1 global distribution of monitoring studies pfas have been monitored in wastewaters worldwide table 2 but the geographical distribution of studies conducted over the last decade is largely unequal fig 1 the majority of studies were conducted in china 31 followed by europe 30 and north america 16 whereas very limited data is currently available for other parts of the world including africa oceania or south america emissions and occurrence of pfas are expected to be higher in more urbanized and industrialized regions which is a possible rationale behind the high number of studies in china wang et al 2015c conversely lesser studies are expected for countries with lower manufacturing output such as australia where pfas issues are mostly associated with the use of imported products usage coggan et al 2019b however detection of significant amounts of pfas maximum reported concentrations of 440 ng l in influents and 560 ng l in effluents in wwtps around australian regions gallen et al 2018 together with recent developments in analytical capabilities might have triggered many recent investigations in australia table 2 at present no little information is available regarding the occurrence fate and transformation of pfas in wwtps of least developed and developing countries except china similar to other persistent organic pollutants pfas tend to move around the earth through atmospheric and or oceanic diffusion lam et al 2017 due to their long range mobility wang et al 2019c the data gaps regarding the occurrence and fate of pfas in wwtps in several parts of the world limits our understanding of their global production usage and transport although the lesser number of studies have been conducted in some countries such as south korea or germany in comparison to china or u s a larger number of wwtps 70 kwon et al 2017 ulrich et al 2016 have been surveyed in a single study for some countries hence comparison of countries based solely on the number of monitoring studies does not present a complete picture of pfas occurrence considering the variableness in conducting monitoring studies worldwide and lack of such details in many studies 3 2 pfas monitored in wwtps to date very few compounds among the vast pfas family have been monitored perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas and perfluoroalkyl sulfonates sulfonic acids pfsas largely dominate letcher et al 2020 ruan and jiang 2017 whereas there is no data for a significant proportion of pfas out of more than 4 000 pfas currently present in the global market wang et al 2017 most studies so far have focussed largely on two long chain pfas which have been used for the longest time pfos and pfoa cohen hubal 2019 the production of long chain pfas has greatly decreased in the last two decades as a consequence of voluntary initiatives e g pfoa pfos and related compounds phased out by 3m in 2000 krafft and riess 2015 national e g pfoa production ban in norway in 2013 li et al 2020 and international restrictions e g inclusion in the stockholm convention in 2009 buck et al 2011 askeland et al 2020 szabo et al 2018 however the proportional distribution of different pfas detected in wwtps worldwide indicates pfoa and pfos were monitored and found in about 70 of studies fig 2 the inability of natural environmental conditions to degrade these recalcitrant pfas blum 2015 with long half lives pfos 41 years and pfoa 92 years szabo et al 2018 olsen et al 2008 could be a possible reason for their prevalence long after phasing out from the year 2000 onwards houtz et al 2016 krafft and riess 2015 wang et al 2009 another long chain pfas pfna c9 has also been reported in more than 40 of studies after being previously detected in a wide range of consumer products and human samples kotthoff and b√ºcking 2018 an unfortunate consequence of these efforts to reduce contamination by conventional pfas is the increased production and use of shorter chain c4 c6 pfas which are now ubiquitous at relatively elevated concentrations in wwtps phong vo et al 2020 a significant proportion 40 of studies reported short chain pfas c 6 e g pfba pfbs pfhxs and pfpea with the exception of pfhxa c6 which was found in 69 of the total studies fig 2 pfhxa has been extensively used as an alternative to pfoa over the last decade which explains its increased occurrence in wwtps shan et al 2014 the detection of the above mentioned short chain pfas in wwtps is consistent with the studies reporting pfhpa pfhxa pfpea pfba and pfbs as the most widely found short chain pfas in the environment li et al 2020 and pfhxs as the most widely used compound in stain and water repellent products wang et al 2015a the danish environmental protection agency 2015 despite their pervasive occurrence in wwtps and other environmental media worldwide no regulatory measures are in place regarding short chain pfas which could be attributed to the limited knowledge about their toxic effects and human exposure pathways recent literature suggests shorter chain pfas might behave similarly in terms of persistence and bio accumulation as their longer chain counterparts ateia et al 2019b and can be equally hazardous as observed during experiments on animals sunderland et al 2019 it is noteworthy that pfhxs having similar toxicity potential as pfoa szabo et al 2018 has been proposed for inclusion as a persistent organic pollutant poprc 15 1 under the stockholm convention kotthoff and b√ºcking 2018 the relative lack of information regarding levels of short and ultra short chain pfas in wastewaters is particularly concerning as the demand for short chain pfas especially in developing countries is likely to increase their release into the environment in the coming years li et al 2020 the occurrence of precursors of pfas and their fate in wwtps is least studied which calls for future research in this field as the production of precursors of pfas outweighs that of pfcas and pfsas letcher et al 2020 pfas precursors e g ftohs are widely used for manufacturing of various products such as fabrics papers surfactants water and stain resistant products and firefighting foams lewis et al 2016 liu et al 2015 shi et al 2015 wang et al 2012 and hence eventually make their way to wwtps zhang et al 2013b where they can transform into pfaas brendel et al 2018 houtz et al 2016 recently two new side chain polymers perfluorooctane sulfonamide urethane polymer and perfluorobutane sulfonamide urethane polymer which could potentially transform into polyfluorinated sulfonamides e g fbsa and fosa and then short chain pfsas e g pfbs were reported for the first time in canadian wwtp sludge with maximum concentrations of 105 and 2 051 ng g d w respectively letcher et al 2020 perfluoroalkyl ether acids pfesas and pfecas and fluorotelomer acids ftsa and ftca are two main classes of pfas which are widely used as alternatives to conventional pfas in electroplating processing aids metal surface treatment plastics manufacturing etc wang et al 2019c wang et al 2015d and hence they are likely to be present in wwtps however very few studies have evaluated the occurrence and fate of such compounds in wwtps hence the role of wwtps as point sources of alternative pfas to the aquatic environment requires deeper investigations 3 3 concentrations of pfas in influents table 3 summarises the concentrations ng l of different pfas classes detected in the influent of wwtps across the world pfaas tend to be more abundant and present at higher concentrations in wwtps relative to other classes of pfas according to filipovic berger 2015 industrial wastes are a primary source of pfaas found in wwtp for instance gallen et al 2018 suspected a local industry to be responsible for high levels 444 ng l of pfaas found in the influent of a wwtp similarly influents receiving wastes from an electroplating industry carried elevated pfas content with short chain pfaas c4 c8 accounting for more than 60 of the total pfas jiawei et al 2019 in some studies conducted prior to 2015 pfoa concentrations were as high as 92 66 000 ng l in wwtp influents sun et al 2012 the lower levels of pfoa typically reported after 2015 3 100 ng l kim et al 2021 lorenzo et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 gallen et al 2018 houtz et al 2018 pan et al 2016 can be attributed to the united efforts undertaken to reduce the production of conventional pfas see section pfas monitored in wwtps above following pfoa pfhxa has been the second most abundant in terms of occurrence in wwtp influents dauchy et al 2017 found pfhxa at an unusually elevated concentration 4 000 ng l in the influent of a wwtp that received raw effluents from a fluorochemical manufacturing plant the technical performance of short chain pfas being lower than long chain pfas ateia et al 2019b larger quantities of short chain pfhxa are typically required to achieve similar performance as long chain pfoa this in turn can lead to the massive production and abundance of pfhxa shan et al 2014 more studies elucidating the reason behind such a high prevalence of pfhxa and tracking its sources to wwtps are needed in addition to short c6 c4 and long c 6 chain pfaas pfsas c9 c4 have also been detected at significant levels up to 1 500 ng l in wwtp influents table 3 the abundance of pfos in domestic wastes chen et al 2012 and the use of pfbs as an alternative to conventional pfas liang and chang 2019 have been stated earlier studies regarding ultrashort c2 c3 chain pfas in wwtps are scarce which could be attributed to the difficulty in analysing three or fewer carbon pfas see the section on sampling and analysis bj√∂rnsdotter et al 2019 confirmed the presence of tfa c2 and pfpra c3 at concentrations as high as 14 000 and 53 000 ng l in landfill leachates and groundwater samples respectively another study in china detected pfpra 17 ng l in the influent of a wwtp zhang et al 2015 these findings highlight the need for a further investigation of wwtps as potential sources of such ultrashort chain pfas to groundwater and or landfills precursors of prevalent pfas have been found at elevated concentrations in influents of some wwtps table 3 unlike pfaas the precursors concentrations systematically decreased from influent to effluent dauchy et al 2017 houtz et al 2018 probably due to their transformation into pfas or other compounds during treatment chen et al 2017b in some cases the precursors were reported in the influent but not in the effluent for instance houtz et al 2018 for the first time reported two new classes of fluorotelomer thioether surfactants ftshcs and fluorotelomer thioether alkylamido hydroxyl carboxylate ftsahcs in the influent but did not find those in the effluent other new pfas e g 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonamide alkylbetaine 6 2 ftab and 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonamide propyl n n dimethylamine m4 have been reported at high concentrations table 3 in influent of a wwtp receiving effluent from a fluorochemical manufacturing facility dauchy et al 2017 thus more monitoring studies involving new classes of pfas and their precursors are recommended to understand their occurrence and fate in wwtps most monitoring studies conducted to date have focused on the occurrence of pfas in the effluents than in influents of wwtps however more work on pfas in the influents could add to the existing knowledge about the source of newly discovered precursors to influents 3 4 concentrations of pfas in effluents knowing the levels of pfas in the effluents of a wwtp allows characterisation of the discharge into the environment effluents with comparatively lesser background matrix effect are easier to analyse than influents this could be a possible reason behind the availability of more data on pfas in effluents than in influents table 3 high levels 1 100 ng l of pfas has been detected in the effluents of wwtps receiving wastes from industries castiglioni et al 2015 wwtp effluents are significant point sources of pfas to various environmental matrices which receive wastewaters either through direct discharge surface and coastal water or application of recycled wastewaters groundwaters soils and vegetation elmoznino et al 2018 found wwtp effluent in the long island south usa to be a source of pfaas to major tributary rivers similarly a study conducted in the state of washington usa suspected the effluent about 200 ng l of pfaas from a wwtp as the source of contamination to the surface water downstream furl et al 2011 inadequate removal or rather elevated levels of pfas in the effluents has been observed in most of the studies table 3 for instance in a recent study shigei et al 2020 noticed that the combined concentration of three pfas i e pfpea pfoa and pfna increased six times from influent to effluent similarly the concentrations of short chain pfas such as pfba pfpea and pfhxa are often larger in the effluent than in the influent lorenzo et al 2019 houtz et al 2018 gallen et al 2018 filipovic et al 2015 arvaniti et al 2012 which is much likely due to the degradation of precursors into recalcitrant shorter chain pfas chen et al 2017b on the other hand the concentration of longer chain pfas c 9 and precursors in the effluent decreased for some cases which could be due to their sorption onto activated sludge zhou et al 2019 sun et al 2012 and or degradation to short chain pfaas zhang et al 2015 houtz et al 2018 suggested adsorption onto sludge and or degradation to be responsible for the absence of novel pfas precursors ftshcs and ftsahcs in the effluent in spite of their detection in the influent another study reported high removal 80 for two new fluorotelomer compounds 6 2 ftab and m4 in the final effluent after treatment dauchy et al 2017 the actual reason behind the substantial elimination of such newly found pfas in effluents is unclear and needs further research however an exception was observed in the case of a pfas precursor 6 2 fts whose concentration doubled after treatment houtz et al 2018 emerging pfas such as the ones mentioned above have comparable levels of residue as their longer chain counterparts and can potentially cause similar impacts as long chain pfas ruan and jiang 2017 hence in depth investigation of newly discovered precursors and fluorinated compounds in terms of their occurrence and fate in wwtp would be helpful in better understanding such contradictory observations 3 5 pfas in biosolids the occurrence of pfas in biosolids and its consequences are often overlooked letcher et al 2020 although biosolids and sludge from secondary treatment are notable routes for pfas emission into the environment e g groundwater soil vegetation etc ebrahimi et al 2021 stoiber et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 pfcas pfsas precursors e g ftohs guerra et al 2014 and novel fluorinated polymers letcher et al 2020 have been detected in biosolids worldwide including north america europe africa asia and australia moodie et al 2021 a recent study in australia reported significant levels of pfas up to 910 ng g in biosolids moodie et al 2021 despite the usage of imported products rather than pfas using manufacturing industries being predominantly responsible for the generation of pfas wastes coggan et al 2019b regulating various operational parameters e g solid retention time temperature and solution chemistry e g ph have shown to reduce the pfas loads in the effluent due to enhanced partitioning of pfas into sludge ebrahimi et al 2021 zhang et al 2013 section 4 1 however these techniques result in the accumulation of pfas in biosolids which could eventually leach into the environment rodr√≠guez varela et al 2021 moodie et al 2021 guerra et al 2014 further research indicating the effects of various process parameters on the leaching and or release of pfas from biosolids into the environment is required pfas enriched biosolids are disposed to landfills stoiber et al 2020 fuertes et al 2017 which could be responsible for the abundance of pfas 10 to 416 000 ng l including short and ultra short chain compounds bj√∂rnsdotter et al 2019 in landfill leachates throughout the world hamid et al 2018 concerns regarding the long term release of pfas from solid waste disposal facilities and associated risks are emerging due to observed emissions of pfas from landfills into various environmental matrices wang et al 2020a while incineration of pfas loaded wastes and evaporation of volatile pfas primarily precursors e g ftohs can discharge pfas including harmful fluorinated greenhouse gases into the atmosphere stoiber et al 2020 wang et al 2020a hamid et al 2018 leaching of pfas can contaminate the groundwater and soil moodie et al 2021 stoiber et al 2020 the potential of commercial landfills to release pfas into the air water and soil require immediate attention moreover treating landfill leachates through wwtps is widely practised stoiber et al 2020 hence pfas could be just transferring between wastewater and solid waste treatment facilities rather than getting removed from the environment and hence more research is needed in this field 4 removal of pfas through wastewater remediation techniques the type of treatment and the physicochemical characteristics of pfas significantly affect their removal efficiencies and composition kibambe et al 2020 ateia et al 2019b chen et al 2018 rahman et al 2014 table 4 summarizes the various treatment techniques and their effectiveness for the removal of pfas from wastewater along with the effect of the background matrix a drastic increase in the concentrations of pfas from influent to effluent has been observed in many studies table 3 and is discussed in more detail in the following section 4 1 full scale treatment 4 1 1 conventional wwtps overview very few studies have investigated the levels of pfas at various stages of a wwtp kibambe et al 2020 wang et al 2019a zhou et al 2019 the design capacity and operating conditions such as hydraulic and sludge retention time feed concentrations temperature flow rate and mixed liquor suspended solids decide the fate of pfas in a wwtp kibambe et al 2020 for instance longer retention time and higher temperature led to the formation of pfaas which increased their levels in the effluent guerra et al 2014 on the other hand unique operating parameters of higher mixed liquor suspended solids 5 000 mg l and longer sludge retention time 45 days enhanced the removal of pfas from the aqueous phase significantly in a wwtp using recirculation of activated sludge kibambe et al 2020 other factors such as the source of wastewaters domestic industrial urban runoff and or agricultural climatic conditions and atmospheric depositions influenced the concentrations of different pfas and their removal from the aqueous phase in wwtps ratola et al 2012 along with process and external factors the type of pfas is also crucial for example pfaas the most abundant class of pfas which are usually present in anionic forms are non volatile and recalcitrant to biodegradation ateia et al 2019b whereas neutral pfas which are mainly precursors such as ftohs and perfluoroalkyl sulfonamidoethanols are volatile and semi volatile wang et al 2021 ateia et al 2019b hamid et al 2018 and hence can be released into the atmosphere from wwtps fuertes et al 2017 to date the knowledge regarding the emission of volatile and or semi volatile pfas from wwtps into the atmosphere and the impact of various treatment processes is limited due to the complex wastewater matrix biological and physicochemical reactions and the unique properties of pfas wwtps directly or indirectly serve as either source or sink for various pfas chen et al 2018 hence the efficiency of different treatment processes in removing pfas and their formation in wwtps needs further study 4 1 2 adsorption in general adsorption and biodegradation are the two processes responsible for the removal of contaminants from the aqueous phase in wwtps however pfas long short ultra short chain and other new alternate pfas are least susceptible to biodegradation due to the strong c f bond 513 10 kj mol 1 rodr√≠guez varela et al 2021 and hence adsorption onto sludge is the primary mechanism for their removal from the aqueous phase in wwtps kibambe et al 2020 the distribution coefficient kd is an important parameter to evaluate the distribution of pfas between sludge adsorption onto sludge and wastewater dissolved phase during wastewater treatment li et al 2021 factors like ph and composition of the wastewater and the structure of pfas influences the partitioning of pfas wang et al 2020b for example with a decrease in ph 9 to 2 the pfas partitioning to sludge intensified resulting in increased sorption onto sludge in acidic conditions ebrahimi et al 2021 the chemical structure of pfas especially the length of the carbon chain dictates the partition behaviour of that pfas between liquid and solid phases mussabek et al 2019 for instance the hexagonal ring structure of perfluoroethylcyclohexane sulfonate was associated with enhanced adsorption onto sediments liu et al 2019b while the ether bonds present in adona was detrimental for its adsorption onto suspended particles sun et al 2016 studies suggest short chain pfas tend to partition to aqueous phase while long chain pfas partitions to the solid phase in the aquatic environment coggan et al 2019b a similar trend was observed in wwtps where partitioning of pfaas to sludge increased with an increase in chain length li et al 2021 mussabek et al 2019 coggan et al 2019b pan et al 2016 owing to the strong affinity of hydrophobic compounds to organic matter li et al 2021 moreover the type of functional group in a pfaas also influences its adsorption onto sludge wang et al 2015a found the kd of pfhxs to be higher than that of pfhpa suggesting a stronger affinity of more acidic sulfonate group towards organic content in the sludge than that of carboxylate groups arvaniti et al 2014 chen et al 2012 further studies utilizing kd for understanding the effect of pfas structure on its adsorption onto sludge could generate new insights very few studies have investigated the influence of pfas headgroup charge anionic cationic and zwitterionic on its partitioning at liquid liquid and solid liquid interfaces ebrahimi et al 2021 xiao et al 2019 brusseau van glubt 2019 while most pfas being anionic are partitioned to the sludge through hydrophobic and or london van der waals interactions cationic and zwitterionic compounds may be electrostatically attracted to negatively charged sites in the sludge along with other forces mentioned above xiao et al 2019 the organic and inorganic matter present in wastewater is also crucial for predicting the partitioning behaviour of pfas ebrahimi et al 2021 in wastewater sludge system which is discussed in later sections 4 2 1 1 and 4 2 1 2 as controlling the pfas loads to influent may be gradual and is not a viable option at present optimization of the process parameters such as maintenance of lower ph and monitoring and regulating organic and inorganic fractions in wastewater to enhance pfas partitioning to sludge could be beneficial the partition behaviour of pfas between water and solids e g sediments suspended particles and soils have been studied more in coastal surface and groundwater systems wang et al 2020b lee et al 2020 liu et al 2019ab mussabek et al 2019 li et al 2019 dong et al 2018 in comparison to wastewater and sludge in wwtps ebrahimi et al 2021 li et al 2021 wang et al 2015a coggan et al 2019b in addition most of the previous studies have focused on the two legacy pfas i e pfoa and pfos liu et al 2019b insights on the partition behaviour of short ultra short chain and precursor pfas between sludge wastewater and effects of treatment type on their partition are insufficient further studies on kd of sludge wastewater systems can provide a better understanding of the fate bioaccumulation adsorption mechanism and transport of pfas during and after treatment 4 1 3 transformation biological remediation techniques e g aerobic anaerobic digestion biological filtration applied during wastewater treatment influence the transformation of pfas precursors in wwtps which ultimately affects the concentrations of pfas in effluents chen et al 2012 while typical wwtp may remove longer chain pfaas from wastewater as a result of their adsorption onto sludge shorter chain pfas are formed during treatment houtz et al 2016 guerra et al 2014 short chain pfas are more persistent than their long chain counterparts resulting in longer term occurrence li et al 2020 therefore future studies should focus on the effective remediation of shorter chain pfas from wastewaters using cost effective robust techniques with practical applicability numerous studies have reported the formation of pfaas after secondary stage especially anaerobic anoxic oxic oxidation treatment table 3 wang et al 2019a zhou et al 2019 houtz et al 2018 chen et al 2012 ftohs and fluorotelomer sulfonates fts constitute a significant class of pfas precursor compounds that can degrade into perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas c 4 when undergoing aerobic and anaerobic treatment hamid et al 2020a hamid et al 2020b zhou et al 2019 coggan et al 2019b chen et al 2018 hamid et al 2018 liu et al 2015 biodegradation of ftohs to pfcas through microbes has been well studied in laboratories chen et al 2017b fluorotelomer carboxylic acids ftcas and unsaturated fluorotelomer carboxylic acids ftcuas are other intermediary compounds derived from fluorotelomer precursors of pfas which can eventually lead to the formation of pfaas as end products hamid et al 2018 the transformation of pfas precursors to product pfas in wwtps is shown in table 5 while many studies have revealed the transformation of pfas precursors into perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas c 4 the ability of precursors to transform into ultrashort chain pfcas c2 c3 remains unexplored a few studies suggested that ultrashort chain pfcas e g trifluoroacetic acid tfa and perfluoropropionic acid pfpra are usually generated at fluoropolymer manufacturing industries chen et al 2019 but overall knowledge regarding the degradation of ultra short chain pfas from their respective precursors in wwtps is limited a significant rise in the levels of pfas for wwtps applying biological deodorization to raw influent wang et al 2019b enunciates the need for evaluating the effect of specific microorganisms used for deodorization methods which caused 70 increase in the concentrations of pfas aerobic treatment also has the potential to degrade pfas precursors zhang et al 2013b which was confirmed by guerra et al 2014 who observed high levels of pfaas in the secondary sludge of a wwtp adopting aerobic oxidation zhang et al 2015 also reported a significant increase of pfas in the final effluent of a wwtp using sequencing batch reactor system overall pfas precursors transformation to pfaas was prominent in wwtps applying biological treatment methods houtz et al 2018 which are likely to break only the c c bond resulting in the formation of shorter chain pfas gagliano et al 2020 the weaker adsorption of pfas onto primary sludge than secondary sludge could be due to the hindrance from background ions see section 4 2 1 2 the enhanced transformation of pfas precursors during biological treatment could also be responsible for the higher detection of pfas in the final effluent after secondary treatment zhang et al 2015 microorganisms could gain energy for their growth from thermodynamically favoured reductive defluorination arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 provided strong electron donors are available to facilitate such reactions thus future studies should focus on the performance of anaerobic microorganisms capable of degrading pfas the efficiency of biological filters in removing pfas from wastewater is dependent on various parameters such as sludge age and thickness biological filters are inefficient in removing short chain pfas c 6 from wastewater observed removal efficiencies of about 60 for pfoa and 20 for pfaas c 6 by biological filtration confirmed the inability of microbial degradation to remove shorter chain pfas kibambe et al 2020 when thickened the biofilm can act as both aerobic outer layer and anaerobic inner layer which could be possibly influencing pfas rejection kibambe et al 2020 biological activated carbon filters using granular activated carbon gac perform more efficiently than biological filters in pfaas removal from wastewater due to the strong ability of gac to adsorb pfaas c 7 pramanik et al 2017 though biological filters biological activated carbon filters showed considerable removal for pfaas 50 kibambe et al 2020 wang et al 2019a activated sludge treatment outperformed both with 90 removal efficiency kibambe et al 2020 castiglioni et al 2015 further investigation to understand the effects of different biological treatments on the fate of pfas precursors long chain short chain and ultra short chain pfas are necessary for drawing tangible inferences in addition to wwtps landfills are also important sites where pfas precursors can transform into pfas the biotic conditions prevailing at landfills and subsequent biochemical treatment of landfill leachates are favourable for this transformation to occur hamid et al 2020a sun et al 2020 wang et al 2020a discharging leachates into wwtps and dumping wwtp sludge in landfills are common practices which may contribute towards pfas levels in both media seo et al 2019 hamid et al 2018 to our knowledge there are no insights available on this interrelation to date which requires further investigation 4 2 lab scale investigations 4 2 1 adsorption among all the processes explored for the remediation of pfas from wastewater adsorption is the most studied at the laboratory scale table 4 adsorption using ion exchange resins has shown promising results with 99 removal efficiency for pfas along with dissolved organics 90 dixit et al 2021 dixit et al 2020a however results obtained at high initial concentrations 5 1 000 mg l of pfas in synthetic and spiked wastewaters are not necessarily applicable to lower and more realistic concentrations 1 000 ng l the formation of nitrosamine precursors during regenerating amine based anion exchange ix resins documented earlier is also concerning flowers and singer 2013 biochar on the other hand successfully removed pfas at a lower concentration 1 000 ng l inyang and dickenson 2017 biochar filtration post secondary treatment after removal of most of the organic matter could facilitate the removal of pfas through adsorption dalahmeh et al 2019 modification of biochar surfaces to improve pfas adsorption especially for short chain pfas should also be further studied other novel adsorbents such as hydrogel polymers and magnetic fluorinated adsorbents showed excellent results in minimum time 2 4 h ateia et al 2019a du et al 2017 however the applicability of these adsorbents at large scale treatment facilities with lower concentrations of pfas and complex background matrix needs to be confirmed 4 2 1 1 role of pfas carbon chain length to date the effect of alkyl chain length on pfas adsorption have been investigated mostly with activated carbon biochars and resins in aqueous and or synthetic wastewater solutions gagliano et al 2020 hydrophobic interactions have been found to be the most prominent mechanism responsible for the adsorption of pfas onto various adsorbents ateia et al 2019a dalahmeh et al 2019 du et al 2014 hydrophobicity of perfluoroalkyl compounds in turn depends on the length of the carbon chain with an increase in the length of the carbon chain from c5 c15 the hydrophobicity and hence their adsorption onto sludge increases zhang et al 2013a shorter chain pfas being less hydrophobic and more water soluble are less likely to get adsorbed onto the sludge in wwtps brendel et al 2018 zhang et al 2013a hence the length of the carbon chain of a pfas plays a crucial role in the adsorption behaviour of that compound as wastewater has a different composition organic and inorganic matter from other aquatic matrices e g surface coastal and or groundwater phong vo et al 2020 pfas interacts differently with adsorbents in wastewater hence more studies are required to understand the role of chain length during adsorption of pfas onto sludge in wastewater matrix the interaction by short and long chain pfas with sludge has been studied using activated carbons and polymers which suggest short chain pfas interact with organic matter through electrostatic repulsions dalahmeh et al 2019 and pore blockage while long chain pfas tend to have hydrophobic interactions gagliano et al 2020 since organic matter constitutes a major fraction of sludge the adsorption mechanism between short ultra short chain pfas and sludge could be studied further as discussed in 4 1 2 4 2 1 2 role of background matrices earlier reviews have discussed in detail the interaction between inorganic and organic ions and organic contaminants kah et al 2017 the organic matter e g proteins lipids carboxylic and amino acids natural and or dissolved organic matter gagliano et al 2020 present in wastewater ebrahimi et al 2021 liu et al 2020 impact the adsorption of pfas onto sludge in wwtps zhang et al 2019 only a few studies have investigated the role of organic ions on pfas removal among which most are concentrated on the effect of humic and fulvic acids banks et al 2020 and least is known about the impact of dissolved organic matter on pfas removal from wastewater dixit et al 2020b found organic matter natural organic matter humic acid and fulvic acid from surface water had a negative impact 55 decrease in adsorption capacity on the adsorption of pfas using ion exchange ix resins as organic ions caused blockage of pores through diffusion and competed with pfas for adsorption sites dixit et al 2021 dixit et al 2019 on the contrary wang et al 2015a found that the adsorption of pfas to sludge reduced significantly after the removal of organic matter from the sludge through thermal treatment hence the authors suggested that pfas has a higher affinity for sludge from secondary treatment with higher biomass zhang et al 2013a observed that protein in the sludge had a positive effect on the adsorption of pfas and deduced that certain amide groups present in proteins could possibly be aiding the adsorption of pfas onto sludge while another study found protein in the wastewater influent led to lower removal of pfos and pfoa pramanik et al 2017 similar to organic ions inorganic ions can have both positive and negative effects on the adsorption of pfas kah et al 2020 banks et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 divalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 can form cation bridge between the negatively charged pfas and sludge thereby improving adsorption zhang et al 2013a in contrast monovalent cations present in wastewater such as na have been found to hinder the adsorption of pfas arvaniti et al 2014 anions such as so4 2 po4 3 no3 cl and cro4 strongly compete with pfas for adsorption sites dixit et al 2021 ateia et al 2019a thereby interfering with the adsorption of pfas on sludge deng et al 2010 ateia et al 2019a observed a rapid decrease 10 20 in the adsorption of short chain pfcas with an increase in anion concentrations whereas high background anions in the real wastewater matrix caused the salting out effect which compensated the hindrance by so4 2 by reducing the solubility of pfas du et al 2015 such conflicting observations in terms of the effect of organic and inorganic ions on the treatment of pfas in wastewater table 4 generates scope for more research on the impacts of different types of organic compounds and inorganic ions cations and anions on the removal of short chain pfas and precursors at environmentally relevant concentrations 1 000 ng l ateia et al 2019a further the effect of co existing pfas in the presence of background ions is yet to be explored indeed the rate of adsorption decreased significantly when three pfcas c6 c7 and c8 were treated simultaneously in wastewater with resins which was attributed to the competitive adsorption between short and long chain pfas du et al 2015 to date most studies have investigated the effects of organic and inorganic ions separately on individual pfas in aqueous solutions at concentrations not relevant to the environment outcomes of the simultaneous effects of various organic and inorganic ions on the removal of co existing short chain c4 pfas and or precursors would be relevant for real world conditions further the chemical interactions between various ions and pfas leading to the differences in adsorption behaviour could provide useful mechanistic insights 4 2 2 other treatment techniques advanced treatment processes like adsorption electrochemical degradation nanofiltration and reverse osmosis dixit et al 2020a ateia et al 2019a wang et al 2019b soriano et al 2017 are comparatively more effective than conventional processes kibambe et al 2020 wang et al 2019a in terms of pfas removal for example a wwtp based on conventional treatment showed negative removal 27 for pfas whereas a wwtp using advanced treatment reverse osmosis achieved 86 removal tabtong et al 2015 similarly a membrane bioreactor system was found to be more effective in removing long chain pfcas than conventional activated sludge treatment pan et al 2016 however it is noteworthy that some treatments like ozonation uv chlorination and sand filtration have been found ineffective in removing pfas gagliano et al 2020 pan et al 2016 nanofiltration nf has been efficient 98 in removing pfas along with dissolved organic carbon and mineral hardness from drinking water franke et al 2021 the efficiency of nf in removing pfas while simultaneously achieving other water quality targets in wastewater needs validation by further studies a study that conducted nf followed by electrochemical degradation could achieve 99 removal of c6 pfaa in less than 3 h for pfas concentrations 1 000 mg l soriano et al 2017 similarly electrochemical treatment processes using electrodes like boron doped diamond anode and stainless steel cathode could achieve 95 degradation of pfas with high and low initial concentrations of 1 642 ¬µg l gomez ruiz et al 2017 and 62 ng l wang et al 2019b within 10 h hence the application of electrochemistry for degradation of short chain pfas and pfas precursors at lower concentrations could be explored more rather than combining it with other techniques treatment trains should involve processes that are not efficient individually while their combined efficiency is higher in terms of pfas removal along with the ease of operation and cost effectiveness for instance ozonation wang et al 2019b and photocatalysis lopes da silva et al 2017 were ineffective in removing pfaas from wastewater matrix individually while the combination of ozonation and photocatalysis led to the degradation of pfas as the reactions between oh and pfaas precursors can initiate degradation reactions forming recalcitrant shorter chain pfas wang et al 2019a wang et al 2018a huang et al 2016 similarly efficient treatment 98 of pfas from drinking water using nf followed by subsequent adsorption of pfas 85 99 from nf concentrate franke et al 2021 calls for more study using such treatment train practices for effective remediation of pfas in wastewaters another unique aerosol based separation technique for remediation of precursor 6 2 ftsa achieved 100 removal within 1 h ebersbach et al 2016 however the initial concentration of the spiked pfas in wastewater was unrealistically high 10 mg l which is one common limitation in experimental studies published to date table 4 more experimental data carried out at realistic concentrations 1 000 ng l li et al 2020 and involving short chain pfas c 4 and matrix effects are needed the knowledge regarding the treatment of pfas precursors from wastewater at environmentally relevant concentrations is also limited 5 conclusions and research recommendations 5 1 conclusions the lack of monitoring data from many parts of the world limits our understanding of the global distribution of pfas the inaccessibility of advanced analytical facilities and the need to meet more pressing wastewater quality issues in many developing countries could be responsible for the dearth of pfas monitoring studies in these regions ultra short chain pfas precursors of pfas and new generation replacements of conventional pfas are understudied which could be attributed to their analytical method limitations and the complexity of topa and non target analysis the relative ease of pfas analysis in effluents having lower background interference than in influents could be responsible for fewer studies of pfas in influents than effluents the partitioning of longer chain pfas to sludge and the transformation of precursors to shorter chain pfaas during biological treatment influence the concentrations of pfas in the sludge and the effluents the release of volatile compounds is a possible route for the transfer of precursors from wastewater to air and remains unexplored currently while most studies monitored the removal of pfas from the aqueous phase effluents their fate after partitioning to sludge and or biosolids is relatively unexplored which compels us to think if the mere shifting of pfas loads from one phase to the other has been misunderstood as removal to date 5 2 research recommendations the limited information about pfas levels in developing and least developed countries necessitates future studies in these regions to date no study has critically reviewed the sampling procedures despite it being critical in monitoring pfas considering the high risk of background contamination monitoring ultra short chain pfas precursors of pfas and new generation pfas in

16957,due to the growing and diverse demands on water supply exploitation of non conventional sources of water has received much attention since water consumption for irrigation is the major contributor to total water withdrawal the utilization of non conventional sources of water for the purpose of irrigation is critical to assuring the sustainability of water resources although numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate and manage non conventional water sources little research has reviewed the suitability of available water technologies for improving water quality so that water reclaimed from non conventional supplies could be an alternative water resource for irrigation this article provides a systematic overview of all aspects of regulation technology and management to enable the innovative technology thereby promoting and facilitating the reuse of non conventional water the study first reviews the requirements for water quantity and quality i e physical chemical and biological parameters for agricultural irrigation five candidate sources of non conventional water were evaluated in terms of quantity and quality namely rainfall stormwater runoff industrial cooling water hydraulic fracturing wastewater process wastewater and domestic sewage water quality issues such as suspended solids biochemical chemical oxygen demand total dissolved solids total nitrogen bacteria and emerging contaminates were assessed available technologies for improving the quality of non conventional water were comprehensively investigated the potential risks to plants

abstract keywords irrigation water quality wastewater decentralization nutrients treatment technology 1 introduction water is not only an essential material for human beings 70 of our bodies by weight but also an important resource for human activities such as agriculture commerce industry and domestic use according to the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations un the annual water withdrawal worldwide from natural water bodies is estimated to be around 4250 km3 of which agricultural use is the largest consumer at around 71 7 of the total withdrawal fao 2021 meanwhile global climate change increases the intensity and frequency of droughts and floods posing a significant threat to the sustainability of agricultural production the 17 sustainable development goals sdgs proposed by the un establish the targets for assuring sustainable development including zero hunger sdg 2 and clean water and sanitation sdg 6 in line with the sdgs the world in 2050 report iiasa 2018 suggested six exemplary transformations for achieving long term sustainability by 2050 including resource allocation to solve the issues of food and water the world economic forum also indicated in their global risks report 2020 that water and food crises are among the top 10 long term risks in the impact category over the next 10 years wef 2019 several semi arid and arid areas especially in the middle east and africa hussain et al 2019 now face serious water stress due to limited water sources therefore it is essential to establish alternative sources of water to meet the water scarcity challenges in agriculture non conventional sources of water receive increasing attention due to their potential to reuse water for human activities morote et al 2019 omran 2019 which can alleviate the water scarcity in agriculture while realizing a circular water economy as shown in fig 1 in the present study the circular water economy is defined as the business model that aims to reuse non conventional water as alternative water source for various purposes while extracting valuable resources from non conventional water to realize sustainable production and consumption brears 2020 pieroni et al 2021 potting et al 2017 the concept of sustainable production and consumption was originally derived from waste to resource supply chains that reduce emissions slootweg 2020 mitigate waste chen et al 2017a and enhance the environmental resilience against climate change feng et al 2018 from the perspective of integrated water resource management beneficial reuse of non conventional water deserves attention as a route toward sustainable water supply hussain et al 2019 conventional water is defined as the water resources of the natural processes of the hydrological cycle where water can be taken from rivers streams lakes reservoirs rainfall and aquifers groundwater by contrast non conventional water as shown in fig 2 comes from seawater stormwater agricultural drainage thermoelectric cooling water hydraulic fracturing water industrial processed waste water domestic wastewater and commercial discharges e g hot spring discharge the massive amount of non conventional water provides a promising opportunity to meet the demand for water as we head toward a new era of urbanization a number of countries have started to reuse treated wastewater for crop growing especially in those areas facing severe water shortages such as egypt el kady and el shibini 2001 jordan abu sharar et al 2003 tunisia haddaoui et al 2017 turkey kanber et al 2005 and saudi arabia qadir et al 2007 however most of the sources for irrigation water are still dominated by conventional water in all arab countries the irrigation water from non conventional water sources amounts to no more than 0 3 while surface water and groundwater supply 70 1 and 29 5 respectively dabour 2006 total annual renewable water resources in 2017 were estimated to be about 42 800 billion m3 year knoema 2018 which was more than the total amount of water withdrawn the key problem is how to collect and utilize the resource appropriately the sources of non conventional water are diverse with significant variation in quality domestic sewage contains pathogenic bacteria cui et al 2019 while seawater and salt groundwater has higher salinity which cannot be used for irrigation without prior treatment bonnelye et al 2004 using non conventional water without proper treatment for irrigation not only impairs plant growth but also causes public health issues since non conventional water may include toxic substances or pathogenic bacteria thus combinations of water reuse technologies are required to support the utilization of non conventional water studies have evaluated the management of non conventional water in different countries such as spain morote et al 2019 china smith et al 2018 south africa mutamba 2017 and egypt omran 2019 several technologies have been developed for non conventional water reuse for different purposes including bio sand filtering of un treated irrigation water li et al 2015 nabila 2015 despite the recent progress little research has been conducted on the performance of water technologies in improving water quality for non conventional water reuse in agriculture this article provides a systematic overview of the regulatory technological and management aspects to enable the adoption of technological innovations in the reuse of non conventional water in line with the sdgs to explore the potential of non conventional water reuse in agriculture the water quality required for agricultural irrigation is reviewed first several non conventional water sources namely stormwater cooling water from power generation hydraulic fracturing wastewater process wastewater and domestic sewage are evaluated in terms of their quantity and quality a number of available technologies for improving the quality of non conventional water are reviewed lastly three priority research directions are proposed 2 water resource management in agriculture 2 1 water use in agriculture water use in agriculture is the most significant of all activities that require water according to the latest data from fao fao 2021 the water withdrawal for agricultural purposes accounts for 71 7 of total water consumption worldwide this proportion is even higher in arid and semi arid countries for example the annual water withdrawals for agriculture in north africa sub saharan africa the arabian peninsula and the middle east are around 85 8 100 2 28 6 and 229 7 km3 or 78 6 78 8 80 7 and 86 3 of the total water withdrawal respectively fao 2021 with population growth the demand for food has grown remarkably and more farming areas and effective agricultural practices are needed to meet growing demand unfortunately the overall amount of conventional water available worldwide remains steady and increasing the area devoted to agriculture requires additional non conventional water resources according to un fao less than 10 of irrigated land uses non conventional water worldwide this proportion should be increased to meet the growing demand for water in the future furthermore the agricultural water withdrawal is around 59 of total renewable water resources fao 2021 in other words more than half of all renewable water resources are needed to meet agricultural purposes 2 2 importance of water quality in agriculture table 1 presents the classification of important water quality parameters and their benchmarks for agricultural irrigation unfavorable levels of ph electrical conductivity ec and oil interfere with the absorption of nutrients by plants a previous study indicated that ec significantly affects crop productivity ding et al 2018 the crops of onions potatoes and dry beans were shown to have a 50 yield reduction for irrigation water with ec higher than 2900 3900 and 2400 ¬µs cm respectively high biochemical oxygen demand bod or chemical oxygen demand cod in water consumes dissolved oxygen do and inhibits plant growth halogens such as chlorine and fluorine can cause damage to the surface tissues of plants most of the regulated heavy metals have different impacts on various crops and tend to accumulate in soil so that the integrity of the ecological system is threatened some heavy metals cause adverse health effects in human beings and the utilization of water containing heavy metals for irrigation should be controlled sodium adsorption ratio sar and residual sodium carbonate rsc indices indicate the sodium hazard and high levels indicate the possible replacement of calcium and magnesium by sodium changing the configuration of soil and affecting soil permeability and crop growth 2 3 regulatory standards in irrigation water quality table 2 summarizes the standards and or recommendations of irrigation water quality in a number of different countries in general ph should be in the range 6 0 8 0 while ec exhibits a broad range from 300 in japan up to 7000 ¬µs cm in tunisia suspended solids ss are not allowed to exceed 100 mg l in a number of asian countries while it is regulated in the range of 10 30 mg l for countries in the middle east north africa and europe a few asian countries regulate the do to be higher than 2 5 mg l both taiwan and egypt have the standard of oil and grease for irrigation water at the concentration of 5 0 mg l a number of asian countries have a more stringent standard i e an order lower for bod cod and total nitrogen tn eighteen heavy metals are regulated in most of the countries depending on their toxicity and chemical characteristics for example the standard of iron fe ranges up to 5 mg l while the limit for mercury hg is only 0 001 0 002 mg l except for lithium li and selenium se the us has different standards for long term and short term exposures as most heavy metals accumulate in the soil several metals such as cobalt co have two orders of difference between the standards for short and long terms generally most of the regulation for the metals does not differ significantly among the countries table 3 presents the regulated biological aqueous standards used for irrigation the standards in the investigated countries can be classified into two different categories i e low and high depending on the target plants generally the low standard is for the edible crops that require cooking before ingestion while the high standard is for vegetables or fruits that can be digested directly fecal coliform and e coli which are related to the feces are the most common indicators used in regulation a number of countries have more stringent bacteria control standards than that suggested by who in order to maintain a healthy environment bacteria are not allowed to be detected in several countries such as south korea and the us because of their high standards for bacterial residues several other countries have a high bacteria standard between 5 and 250 cfu while a few countries set limits in the range of 200 10 000 cfu 3 sources of non conventional water in the present study a number of sources of non conventional water are explored namely stormwater runoff cooling water hydraulic fracturing water industrial process water e g pulp paper and food industries and domestic wastewater the quality and quantity of these sources are systematically discussed 3 1 rainfall and stormwater runoff rainfall and stormwater runoff are one type of non conventional water source that can be used for irrigation purpose however significant quantities of them directly flow into the surface water bodies such as rivers and are not readily accessible for further application if they were collected properly rainfall and stormwater runoff are a potential water source and usually do not require advanced treatment prior to irrigation collected rainfall or stormwater runoff can be even used as the alternative water resource in the dry season therefore different types of rainfall collection also known as runoff harvesting have been developed and widely employed abas and mahlia 2019 bashar et al 2018 yannopoulos et al 2019 rainfall collection systems can be located on the roof of a building for the purposes of home planting or toilet devkota et al 2015 be placed in the large scale raft foundation underneath airports and schools antunes and ghisi 2020 tzanakakis et al 2020 and even be installed as a ridge furrow rainfall harvesting system for direct irrigation zhang et al 2020 important parameters for successful runoff harvesting include the terrain and soil properties for the terrain a deep area is preferable to collect a large amount of precipitation and a steep slope enables the maximum collection of rainwater the soil should be of low permeability in the catchment area or a waterproof cover is required soil of a high permeability can be used for the connection between the catchment and the application farmland in general runoff harvesting systems are deployed near the farmlands that need irrigation as shown in figure s1 to reduce the evaporation loss yosef and asmamaw 2015 in some cases rainwater harvesting systems require on site containers such as barrels pipes and other auxiliaries which impact the ecosystem and the overall environmental impacts should be critically addressed 3 2 cooling water cooling water is used in boilers and cooling towers which are widely used in thermoelectric power plants and various other industries such as pulp and paper iron and steel and petroleum it accounts for 70 80 of total industrial water usage wang et al 2006 in the us the cooling water used in thermoelectric power generation amounts to approximately 196 billion gallons per day bauer et al 2014 thereby having significant potential to meet the needs of irrigation from alternative sources after several recirculating cycles cooling water is discharged in order to prevent corrosion deposition and biofilm formation ouyang et al 2006 the corrosion and deposition issues are mainly attributed to the alkalinity hardness and microbial induced parameters of cooling water kokilaramani et al 2021 which correspond to its high calcium and magnesium concentrations in the aqueous phase as presented in table s1 fig 3 shows a few selected water quality indices of cooling water although alkalinity is not a regulated standard of irrigation water it does cause damage to plants and impairs to the environment high alkaline water can cause lime deposition and pipe plugging in the irrigation system lime deposition may precipitate nutrients and affect their fate in the soil hopkins et al 2007 the presence of high sulfate and chloride accelerates the deposition as they often combine with ca2 and mg2 to form the insoluble inorganic substances resulting in high tds 1342 1482 mg l and ec 1500 3620 ¬µs cm as a result desalination is often suggested for cooling water treatment bacteria also pose a concern when reusing cooling water pan et al 2018c as the microbial concentration often exceeds the regulated standard as the cooling water remains in the system bacteria grow and accumulate causing several health concerns that need considering when reusing cooling water for irrigation purposes 3 3 hydraulic fracturing wastewater natural gas attracts great attentions due to its high efficiency and environmentally friendly characteristics in the process of generating electricity mojid et al 2021 among the diverse sources of natural gas shale gas has promising potential and its production share increased from 2 2000 to 23 2010 of the total us natural gas production administration 2012 shale gas production reached about 13 5 trillion cubic feet in 2014 eia 2014 and is expected to increase in the future the global natural gas supply should grow by 69 from 2012 to 2040 to meet the increasing demand for natural gas conti et al 2016 in line with increasing demand of shale gas the wastewater generated from the production processes will also increase generally hydraulic fracturing a process injecting a huge amount of pressurized water into the wellbore is a common method to release shale gas stringfellow et al 2014 however massive amounts of wastewater i e hydraulic fracturing water is generated during after the operation period the generation rate can be as high as 1000 m3 day at the initial stage and decreases gradually after it stabilizes the wastewater generation would be around 2 8 m3 day gregory et al 2011 on average the wastewater production from hydraulic fracturing worldwide is 250 million barrels per day torres et al 2016 which could be reused in agriculture if the fracking wastewater is subjected to proper treatment processes table s2 summarizes the selected water quality parameters of hydraulic fracturing water around the world and their graphical presentation is shown in fig 4 the concentrations of cl and na are higher than the respective standards for irrigation water leading to high ec sar and tds such high concentrations also imply that hydraulic fracturing water cannot be used for irrigation without proper treatment or the water absorption ability of plants and soil permeability would decrease meanwhile its bod and cod are also higher than the regulated standards because of the dissolution of organic matters from the soil during the hydraulic fracturing process given the high tn content in the hydraulic fracturing wastewater it may also need denitrification all the heavy metals content in the hydraulic fracturing water are lower than the respective standards for irrigation water except for iron the iron comes from the soil and must be removed to meet the water quality requirement for irrigation purposes 3 4 process wastewater pulp paper and food industries among the industries other than those generating cooling water and fracturing wastewater the pulp and paper industry produces the most wastewater the pulp and paper industry generates wastewater at a rate of around 300 000 400 000 l ton while other industries produce less than 300 000 l ton ranade and bhandari 2014 however the quantities of process wastewater generated in the pulp paper industries varied from country to country therefore the suitability of process wastewater as the alternative irrigation water resource is questionable in terms of quantity depending on the development of the country in the study by soloman et al 2009 the cod 925 mg l and bod 102 mg l in the pulp and paper wastewater effluent were higher than the effluent standards due to extensive use of organic solvents in the manufacturing process another reason for high organic content is the carbohydrate constituents of wood the literature also reports that the cod in the effluent from the pulp and paper industry is around 1248 mg l tarlan et al 2002 and 1400 mg l vieira et al 2001 another concern is the solids dissolved or in suspension in the wastewater the ss contents can be up to 570 mg l which is higher than the regulated standard 100 mg l the high conductivity in the range of 2860 5600 ¬µs cm implies the possible issue of dissolved solids pizzichini et al 2005 soloman et al 2009 for the dissolved solids the chloride and sulfate attract most attention because their aqueous concentrations are often above the regulation level pizzichini et al 2005 in contrast with this sodium magnesium and calcium do not cause any problem as the sar is within the acceptable range of 5 8 7 2 in addition the coliform bacteria in the pulp and paper wastewater is usually within the range of 1 2 3 5 108 cfu 100 ml which are well within the regulation levels gauthier et al 2000 the food industry is quite heterogeneous including mills that process dairy meat olive oil and other products the wastewater from those mills can be very diverse in quantity and quality for example wine and vinegar industrial wastewater has the wastewater generation factor around 11 46 m3 ton while that for dairy products it is in the range 3 10 m3 ton doorn et al 1997 the variation in these factors depends on the regional development plan generally the wastewater from the food industry contains high cod bod and ss that require further treatment prior to irrigation use connor et al 2017 for instance dairy wastewater has the maximum cod of about 95 g l wang and serventi 2019 which is higher than the regulated standard table 2 similar results were found by di berardino et al 2000 who indicated the cod between 530 2620 mg l in the food industrial wastewater most food production leads to organic matters of proteins lipids or carbohydrates as bod cod in the wastewater meanwhile the nutrients of nitrogen and phosphate are observed in different food industries such as brewing and dairy connor et al 2017 when applied in the appropriate quantity using wastewater from the food industry for irrigation is another method for facilitating nutrient recycling however industrial production of meat products releases wastewater containing nitrogen 2740 mg l above the regulated standard cristian 2010 on the other hand the discharge from food companies has high levels of sodium and chloride ions the salt additives are the major source of these ions that impact on plant growth when such wastewater is used for irrigation proper treatment for oil removal is also required because oil is another issue of food industry waste as most food e g meat diary cheese vegetable oil contains fats affandi et al 2014 nisola et al 2009 on the other hand the wastewater discharge from vegetable processing facilities may contain pesticide and fertilizer residues so that such wastewater can be beneficial to plant farming when used for irrigation with well controlled practice connor et al 2017 with the presence of nutrients bacteria can grow vigorously in the wastewater causing another issue for the re utilization of reclaimed water g√ºzel seydim et al 2004 3 5 domestic sewage domestic sewage comprises the used water from our daily routines such as toilets cooking dish washing and plant watering generally domestic sewage can be divided into gray water and black water gray water is composed of the wastewater from the activities of showering laundry and dish washing while black water includes urine flush water feces and toilet flush al hamaiedeh and bino 2010 boutin and eme 2016 memon and butler 2006 found that the proportions of daily routine water consumption for water closet washing machine kitchen sink and bath were about 31 20 15 and 15 respectively the average daily water consumption per person varies from country to country and is highly related to the economic development habits water resource availability population and climatic characteristics to increase the available water resource for irrigation domestic sewage can be considered as supplementary irrigation water in countries where daily water consumption is high and the wastewater can be reclaimed to supply the irrigation water for example countries with high water consumption are the us 575 l day capita followed by australia 493 l day capita italy 386 l day capita japan 374 l day capita and mexico 366 l day capita fig 5 shows the selected water quality indices of domestic sewage one concern for reusing domestic sewage is the ss most of the ss content in domestic sewage is high so that domestic sewage should not be used for irrigation purpose without proper treatment grisolia et al 2005 lado and ben hur 2009 domestic sewage also contains organic matter that is considered beneficial to growing plants however the situation can be totally different if the bod cod exceeds the upper limit for irrigation water especially when it contains toilet flush black water and kitchen discharge in which the cod is around 2 3 orders above the irrigation criterion kujawa roeleveld et al 2006 high bod cod causes the depletion of dissolved oxygen and trace metals can reduce the absorption of nutrients nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate from detergents are also beneficial to the growth of crops however excessive nutrients in the irrigation water may result in eutrophication and overgrowth of crops the tn of the toilet flush and kitchen discharge typically ranges between 1600 and 3000 mg l kujawa roeleveld et al 2006 which is the main source of nutrients in domestic sewage other ions such as chloride and sulfate ions are also high in domestic sewage making it inappropriate for irrigation purposes table s3 the possible sources of the aqueous chloride and sulfate are salts which are used extensively for seasoning food rsc is also above the regulated standard and excessive rsc alters the characteristics of soil and impacts plant growth the pathogenic bacteria and viruses in domestic sewage are another issue of concern there is a huge amount of e coli in the feces of human beings as the toilet flush is a part of domestic sewage the number of e coli 8 5 106 cfu per 100 ml can be several times higher than the criterion suggested by who tawfik et al 2003 causing health concerns when eating crops furthermore domestic sewage contains various types of emerging contaminants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs and antibiotic resistant genes args ghattas et al 2017 which cannot be degraded naturally thomaidi et al 2015 the concentrations of a number of emerging contaminants have been found to be high in domestic sewage such as 17Œ± ethinylestradiol diethylstilbestrol lei et al 2020 4 tert octylphenol bisphenol a 4 nonylphenol chen et al 2020 teta bird et al 2019 tetx belding and boopathy 2018 and meca boopathy 2017 4 technologies for non conventional water reuse table s4 summarizes concerns for the reviewed wastewater as the source for irrigation water 4 1 monitoring systems it is important to apply necessary monitoring and or detection technologies for non conventional water reuse to evaluate the quantity and quality of pollutants in water and soils and thus adjust the operating conditions of treatment processes according to the real situation for instance noticed adverse environmental impacts inhibiting the widespread application of wastewater reuse as irrigation mainly arise from the nutrients and salt content in the treated wastewater a number of detection technologies have been developed and deployed for monitoring different water quality parameters such as heavy metals syu et al 2020 nutrients leonel and tonetti 2021 human enteric viruses and coliphages truchado et al 2021 leonel and tonetti 2021 suggested that periodic monitoring of nutrients in treated non conventional water should be deployed to avoid imbalance in the supply of nutrients as the amount of nutrients in wastewater varies significantly the monitoring of water quality parameters using distributed smart sensors should also be integrated with efficient models to optimize non conventional water reuse singh 2021 also fonseca et al 2007 suggested that the monitoring of soil quality following the application of treated wastewater is imperative to sustain food quality 4 2 control and treatment of major contaminants attention should be paid to the ec coupled with the two anions cl and so4 2 since the observed ec may exceed the irrigation water quality standard and a similar situation also occurs with the indices of bacteria and bod cod among the five investigated categories of wastewater three were found to have issues concerning ec bod cod and bacteria suspended solids are present in a number of sources of non conventional wastewater such as domestic sewage hydraulic fracturing water and the wastewater from the pulp and paper industry specific attention should be paid to domestic sewage hydraulic fracturing water and food industry wastewater in terms of the nitrogen problem other concerns such as oil heavy metals and sar are present in several special cases suspended solids in non conventional wastewater can be reduced by a number of commercial technologies such as sedimentation song et al 2000 coagulation bukhari 2008 ebeling et al 2003 and filtration mulligan et al 2009 this is also the case for bod cod which is a legacy pollutant and there are a lot of available treatment technologies for bod cod removal including membrane filtration hube et al 2020 coagulation zhao et al 2021a adsorption shawwa et al 2001 biological degradation bhat and gogate 2021 and chemical oxidation blonskaja et al 2006 in the present study we focus on the treatment technologies for removing salinity ammonia nitrogen and bacteria which are the major concerns for most of the candidate water sources larger or equal to the regulated level and shown by three solid dots in table s4 4 2 1 desalination to date many desalination technologies have been developed and applied to remove excess ions and or salts from water fig 6 shows the expected time to commercialization for various types of desalination technologies the earliest technology of desalination was distillation which started in the 1960s al shammiri and safar 1999 in general the principle of distillation based desalination is to separate the water from salt by the difference in their boiling points the water is vaporized and condensed while the dissolved salts precipitate out in the distillation process el dessouky et al 1999 advanced distillation technologies have incorporated renewable energy such as solar power singh et al 2020 residual heat gonz√°lez et al 2017 and geothermal energy sarbatly and chiam 2013 to reduce the energy cost another often used technology for desalination is membrane filtration and it is often applied to seawater and brackish groundwater desalination lee et al 2011 wang et al 2008 the operation can be divided into various categories based on the pore sizes and characteristics of the filters membranes including microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro the key point of this technology is to differentiate the salt and water molecules on the basis of size generally mf and uf are used for solid removal as the size of the salts are smaller than the pore size jiang et al 2013 investigated three pore sizes mfs i e 1 4 0 8 and 0 2 ¬µm for their performance in removing tss and conductivity from hydraulic fracturing water the best performance was the one with the smallest pore size 0 2 ¬µm but the removal ratio of conductivity was only 2 7 although the tss removal ratio can be up to 100 another study tested the performance of desalination of cooling water from industrial application by uf and found the rejection rate was only 23 davood abadi farahani et al 2016 a similar study by xu et al 2007 found that the conductivity was slightly reduced from 39 000 47 680 to 38 000 42 000 ¬µs cm after uf treatment which did not meet the water quality standard for irrigation the treatment performance of nf depends on the pore size and it has been found that nf with small pore size had the removal ratio of 51 7 while only 19 5 was obtained by using the nf with large pore size kaya et al 2015 in the test the ions including na mg2 ca2 cl and so4 2 which were the main salts present in the selected non conventional wastewater were examined the results indicated that the removal ratios were 50 0 96 9 95 5 56 3 and 99 2 respectively with the small pore size nf while the removal ratios achieved by the large pore size nf were 15 4 98 8 97 5 21 9 and 98 8 respectively the ions with multiple charges could be efficiently removed by nf this treatment technology may be adapted to treat the cooling wastewater from industrial applications which often contains ca2 mg2 and so4 2 although mf uf and nf did not demonstrate excellent desalination performance like ro they were considered to be effective pre treatment for ro since they could remove large particles in the wastewater without pre treatment the ro system is subject to fouling more frequently for desalination ro is frequently used because of its high salt rejection ratio lee et al 2011 the treatment efficiency for cooling water from industrial application by ro was investigated by davood abadi farahani et al 2016 the ec was reduced from 2928 to 76 ¬µs cm a rejection ratio of 97 using ro without any pre treatment another study also examined the treatment efficiency of a single ro membrane and displayed a 97 reduction of ec and tds the corresponding removal ratios of na mg2 ca2 cl and so4 2 by ro were 98 0 99 6 99 0 98 0 and 99 8 respectively kaya et al 2015 in other words the removal ratios of salinity using ro were promising and could be successfully applied to desalination however a costly high pressure application is required at the feed to force the water molecules through ro membrane during operation qadir et al 2007 also the disposal of the brine solution was a problem in the ro operation morillo et al 2014 compared with ro distillation technology generates better quality water than ro the levels of dissolved solids produced in distillation are several orders less than those in ro qadir et al 2007 the operation and maintenance for distillation are also easier as ro needs regular replacement of the membrane and materials and the pre treatment for distillation is easier as well the suspended particles need to be removed before the untreated water is subject to the ro process however ro has a lower energy cost than distillation and the cost of ro is expected to be even lower as new energy recovery systems are developed skuse et al 2021 a recently developed membrane application technology is forward osmosis fo unlike ro which needs high pressure at the inflow fo requires nearly no additional pressure and that reduces the operation costs significantly eyvaz et al 2018 the principle of fo is to create a draw solution which has higher osmotic pressure than the incoming solution the water molecule penetrates into the draw solution through the membrane to achieve desalination akther et al 2015 however the draw solution is mainly produced by the salts so that desalination is still required after the operation the solution for the fatal drawback of fo is yet to be found other than filtration and distillation a number of electrochemical technologies can be applied for desalination such as electrodialysis ed electrodeionization edi and capacitive deionization cdi ed includes a membrane in the system but the driving force is not pressurized instead electricity is employed as the driving force the membrane used in this system is a selective membrane which only allows cations or anions to pass through after energizing the electrodes the cations and anions are attracted by the anode and cathode respectively mohammadi and kaviani 2003 confirmed that a tds ec removal ratio above 98 could be achieved under optimal operating conditions a flow rate of 0 3 ml s and a voltage of 6 v with the influx concentration of 30 000 mg l another study by adhikary et al 1991 examined the influence of inlet tds concentration and flow rate on the desalination performance by ed the result showed that the tds reduction ratio decreased if the flow rate was reduced and the inlet tds concentration increased the reduction efficiency was 83 3 a high flowrate of 9 0 l hr 93 5 a low flowrate of 4 8 l hr for a low inlet tds concentration 6000 mg l while it increased to 43 9 70 8 for high inlet tds concentration 36 000 mg l the voltage effect was evaluated by for seawater desalination and they found that the required operating time to meet the drinking water standard for nacl was decreased from 70 minutes to 27 minutes by increasing the voltage from 9 v to 18 v the removal efficiency was enhanced from 50 0 to 98 5 while the influx nacl concentration increased from 1 g l to 35 g l at the compromise of longer treatment times i e increasing from 17 minutes to 150 minutes an edi system has a similar configuration to that in ed and the major difference is the replacement of the selective membrane in ed by ion exchange resin in edi the advantage of using ion exchange resin is that the regeneration process does not need any chemicals and the conductivity between compartments is increased which generates purer water strathmann 2010 the edi consisting of a layer of weak acid resin and another of strong base resin ratio 1 2 was tested by shen et al 2014 who found a removal efficiency of ec 99 9 after 12 hours in the second layer which is the brine effluent the ec gradually increased from the start of the experiment the effluent from the first layer exhibited a breakthrough time around 8 hours another study reported that the salt removal ratio could be up to 98 99 pan et al 2018b a continuous type edi was investigated and found that the reduction ratio of ec was 97 4 coupled with ion concentrations below 4 ¬µg l ca2 mg2 na cl no3 and so4 2 song et al 2005 advanced edi configurations were developed to stabilize the quality of water produced and further increase the conductivity of the compartment for instance the feed water was introduced into the ion conductive material which was placed between two ion exchange membranes pan et al 2018a zheng et al 2018 investigated the desalination performance by wafer enhanced edi and indicated that 90 and 99 9 salinity removal ratios were attained at 35 and 90 minutes respectively with a voltage of 10 1 v with the initial salinity concentration of 3 g l a removal ratio of 94 4 99 9 was achieved in all the experiments after 90 minutes similar observations were also reported by pan et al 2017 another electrochemical technology for desalination is cdi which is a membrane free technology using ion adsorbed electrodes with high surface area and voltage to hold ions oren 2008 mossad et al 2013 used cdi to perform desalination on brackish water with various flow rates the tds removal efficiency was found to be 86 at a flow rate of 1 l min while only 65 removal efficiency was achieved at a flow rate of 9 l min three ions ca2 mg2 and na were measured and the removal efficiencies were around 87 86 and 73 for a flow rate of 1 l min respectively the impact of a novel mno2 nanoporous carbon composite on the treatment efficiency was also investigated yang et al 2011 salinity removal efficiency was 81 5 which was higher than that of activated carbon 26 1 the adsorption capacity 16 9 ¬µmol g of this material was also larger than that of activated carbon 5 4 ¬µmol g another electrode constructed by ordered mesoporous carbon carbon nanotube composite was used for electrode fabrication peng et al 2012 it was found that around 80 of ec reduction was observed while only around 20 removal can be achieved by commercial activated carbon after 2 hours of operation the performance of a carbon nanotube electrode can be further enhanced by adding additional composites such as polyaniline yan et al 2012 and polyacrylic acid nie et al 2012 4 2 2 denitrifying generally nitrogen reduction in wastewater is achieved through biological reactions and conventional treatments such as coagulation do not significantly remove nitrogen a previous study using three different coagulants for nitrogen removal showed that the removal efficiency of ammonium nitrogen nh3 n was only 17 aguilar et al 2002 nitrogen rejection technologies of membrane filtration are always accompanied by biological treatment such as aerated biofilm reactor terada et al 2003 and anoxic aerobic bioreactor wang et al 2005 a sequencing batch reactor sbr coupled with activated sludge was explored by wang et al 2009 who used domestic wastewater containing tn of 37 mg l and showed 83 removal efficiency on the tn rejection similar results were also reported in the literature jin et al 2012 wei et al 2014 that 87 8 of the tn was removed by the sbr activated sludge process abattoir wastewater with high nitrogen content i e 1057 mg l tkn was treated by the sbr activated sludge process and more than 97 reduction of tkn observed cassidy and belia 2005 a previous study demonstrated that the dominant microbial species for nitrogen reduction in the sludge were ammonia oxidizing bacteria bassin et al 2011 nitrite oxidizing bacteria pronk et al 2014 and denitrification bacteria di bella and torregrossa 2013 gupta and gupta 2001 employed a three stage rotating biological contactor rbc to remove nitrogen from domestic sewage its performance was affected by the initial nitrogen concentration for a given hydraulic retention time the tn reduction would drop from 82 5 to 46 9 when the initial tn concentration was reduced from 110 8 mg l to 54 4 mg l another study employed a two stage rbc to treat municipal wastewater containing tn concentrations of 39 118 mg l and the effluent tn concentration was observed around 12 64 mg l indicating the removal efficiency of 27 7 78 5 hiras et al 2004 the effect of hydraulic retention time on the performance of the rbc for nitrogen reduction was evaluated by gupta and gupta 1999 and the results revealed that a longer residence time 20 7 33 0 reduction for 9 18 days resulted in less efficient performance on nitrogen reduction than a shorter residence time 48 1 68 6 reduction for 6 8 days for anaerobic treatment the anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox process is frequently used to remove nitrogen anammox had only 10 of the operational cost of a conventional system jetten et al 2001 unlike the traditional nitrification and denitrification processes anammox uses ammonia and nitrite as reactants to convert nitrogen into nitrogen gas by autotrophic bacteria around 80 90 nitrogen was converted to nitrogen gas while the rest became nitrate capodaglio et al 2016 as a result partial transference from ammonia into nitrite but not into nitrate called partial nitrification was required for the anammox process the reactor configuration can be divided into two reactor and one reactor systems depending on the combination or separation of these two steps partial oxidation and anammox paredes et al 2007 g√ºven et al 2004 tested the performance of anammox with a continuous flow single reactor the removal ratios of ammonium and nitrite after 262 days were over 90 and 99 respectively resulting a tn concentration reduction of 87 the reduction ratio can be elevated 90 reduction of tn concentration if the retention time is increased 272 511 days anammox using a single rbc reactor was performed by siegrist et al 1998 and the nitrogen removal ratio was around 0 4 1 2 kg n m2 d similar result was found by pynaert et al 2002 who used the similar configuration to obtain 1 55 kg n m2 d an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb digestion was adopted for anammox application and had an 86 5 92 3 removal efficiency for tn with a retention time of 389 400 days the nitrogen removal ratio was 2 28 6 39 kg n m3 d imajo et al 2004 different reactor types including fluidized bed and fixed bed were examined by strous et al 1997 both configurations had excellent reduction performance on the nitrite 99 while 84 and 88 removal efficiency of ammonium were achieved by the fluidized bed and fixed bed respectively as indicated previously two reactor configuration consisted of one partial nitrification reactor and one anammox reactor the up air flow continuous stirred tank reactor cstr coupled with sbr were used for partial nitrification and anammox fux et al 2002 overall a 90 removal ratio were found at the effluent with negligible sludge production the rate determining step for the entire system was the partial nitrification a similar cstr sbr configuration was adopted by van dongen et al 2001 who found that only 53 of ammonia was converted into nitrite at the first reactor which was promising for activating anammox over 80 of the inflow ammonia was successfully converted into nitrogen gas anammox technology is one of the state of the art technologies for removing nitrogen from wastewater nowadays ahn 2006 4 2 3 disinfection the disinfection process is critical to the reuse of reclaimed water since it is directly related to the public health issue in some cases non conventional water may contain bacteria and viruses and require disinfection in the conventional wastewater treatment process coagulation can be a general microbial removal technology sozzi et al 2015 explored the efficiencies of two coagulants i e hydrated lime and aluminum sulfate in microbial removal after treatment the coliforms were reduced from 17 500 to 5 cfu 100 ml and from 49 800 to 106 cfu 100 ml for hydrated lime and aluminum sulfate respectively both coagulants could remove more than 99 of bacteria similar results were found by meri√ß et al 2002 who used ca oh 2 as a coagulant to achieve 73 removal efficiency for e coli and 81 for all coliforms on the other hand feso4 coagulant can produce a removal ratio of 96 99 for both e coli and total coliforms a combination of ca oh 2 and feso4 was applied as an integrated coagulant in different ph conditions and dosages 98 99 e coli and total coliforms reduction were achieved filtration is also a commonly used technology for removing microbial organisms g√≥mez et al 2006 studied the efficiency of various filtration systems on the reduction of fecal coliform and e coli for the disk filter and pressure sand filter systems the removal ratio for both fecal coliform and e coli were around 31 36 which was not efficient enough microfiltration mf performed excellently on microorganism reduction 99 8 for fecal coliform and 100 for e coli the uf process also achieved 99 998 and 100 reductions for fecal coliform and e coli respectively similar uf research by zhang et al 2006 indicated that the uf could not only reduce the turbidity and cod but also remove the total bacteria with a removal efficiency of up to 98 7 in another study three different filtration systems were investigated and the results showed that the effluents of dual media filters and cartridge filters still contained 80 90 of the initial bacteria concentration however the ro filtration system can have a bacteria removal efficiency of above 99 leparc et al 2007 uasb was investigated by tawfik et al 2003 and its removal ratio of e coli was around 54 86 depending on the operating temperature rbc was found to have an efficiency of 69 removal for e coli moreover the combination of uasb and rbc could achieve 92 5 e coli removal at 30 c different from anaerobic treatment a fixed film aerobic process was examined by pant and mittal 2007 and the fecal coliform decreased from 3010 000 to 46 800 mpn 100 ml after the aerobic process with 98 2 removal efficiency a similar result was reported by uemura et al 2002 that the fixed film aerobic process had fecal coliform reduction ratio of 98 6 the activated sludge plant was investigated to have over 99 fecal coliform reduction average 25 000 000 to 130 000 cfu 100 ml the aerobic process was found to be more efficient in microbial reduction than anaerobic treatment for disinfection chlorine is the most popular agent used in water wastewater treatment plants a number of studies show its high removal efficiency nearly 100 on e coli sobsey 1989 and fecal coliform pant and mittal 2007 however the critical concern of chlorine disinfection is the generation of process by products including trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids which have attracted attention because of their adverse effects on the public health gopal et al 2007 nieuwenhuijsen et al 2000 peracetic acid or peroxyacetic acid paa is an alternative oxidant to chlorine for disinfection ao et al 2021 it can release oxygen molecules with a high oxidation potential paa can damage the microbial catalase and further inactivate the microorganism block 2001 previous studies showed that paa results in over 99 99 removal ratio for e coli fecal coliform and total coliform within 5 20 minutes kitis 2004 the disadvantages include raised levels of bod cod because paa is an organic molecule which impairs the water quality and facilitates the growth of bacteria and microorganisms in the receiving water body iron another popular disinfectant not only acts as a coagulant but also as a disinfectant in wastewater treatment the iron can trigger the fenton reaction which is recognized as an advanced oxidation process aop that can degrade organic contaminants pignatello et al 2006 sharma et al 2005 used iron as a disinfectant and found that over 99 of e coli was killed at the iron dosage of 20 50 ¬µm similar results were found by waite 1979 when the addition of ferrate significantly decreased the concentration of total bacteria fecal coliform and total coliform by 91 99 99 and 99 98 respectively another popular reagent used for disinfection is ozone silva et al 2010 explored the ozone disinfection efficiency in wastewater treatment at various dosages 5 10 mg l and contact times 5 15 minutes the results revealed that the inactivation rate of total coliform was 2 2 3 7 log kill while 2 6 4 3 log kill of e coli occurred demonstrating a satisfactory performance for disinfection for physical treatment processes ultraviolet light received a great deal of attention due to its high disinfection efficiency without byproduct formation hijnen et al 2006 ultraviolet light can damage the dna of microorganisms grossweiner and smith 1989 a number of studies demonstrated that the maximum disinfection effect occurred at the ultraviolet wavelength of 260 nm as the radiation could be absorbed by most of the dnas of microorganisms song et al 2016 99 of fecal coliform reduction was achieved at 20 40 c at the applied radiation dose of 54 60 ¬µws cm2 abu ghararah 1994 a similar result of 99 reduction on 14 bacteria and three viruses was observed by johnson et al 2010 4 2 4 advanced processes for emerging contaminants emerging contaminants such as pharmaceutical and personal care products persistent organic compounds and microplastics ofori et al 2021 may not be efficiently removed by conventional water treatment plants and thus would pose potential risks to reuse for irrigation recently several technologies have been developed and applied for removing emerging contaminants from wastewater for instance advanced oxidation processes aops such as ozonation and fenton reaction were found to exhibit good performance on the removal of edcs ghernaout and elboughdiri 2020 si et al 2019 found that the colloidal 17Œ≤ estradiol estriol 17Œ± ethunylestradiol cannot be detected after ozonation similarly over 80 of soluble edcs were found to be effectively removed by the ozonation process huang et al 2019 for the fenton reaction sharma et al 2016 found an average of 2 42 5 log removal ratio on the args in addition to aop a membrane bioreactor mbr is effective in removing emerging contaminants ahmed et al 2017 a number of edcs such as triclosan and atendol can be effectively reduced by over 97 varjani and chaithanya sudha 2018 wang et al 2020 also demonstrated that the average cell free args can be completely removed by mbr catalytic processes are also an effective approach to removing emerging contaminants from wastewater for instance the magnetic carbon nanocomposites have been developed for 4 nitrophenol degradation with the achievable removal efficiency of around 90 using the catalyst dosage of 0 08 g l chen et al 2017b after treatment the magnetic catalysts could be easily recovered and regenerated simply by a magnet other kinds of magnetic nanocomposite catalysts such as fe3o4 au kou et al 2020 fe3o4 cu w zhao et al 2021b and cu cufe2o4 zheng et al 2020 have been developed the removal efficiency of emerging contaminants can be up to 96 7 by the fe3o4 au catalyst kou et al 2020 moreover the nanocomposite catalyst can be adopted on the electrodes incorporated with electrochemical treatment fadillah et al 2019 or be used in other detection and photocatalysis processes wu et al 2021 these processes usually have removal efficiencies of over 95 for emerging contaminants and are promising for future practical applications 4 3 systematic assessment for irrigation using non conventional water systematic assessment from various aspects such as plants environment human health and climate change should be critically considered and addressed to avoid potential risks salgot and folch 2018 suggested that besides the options of available technologies the reuse of reclaimed water should depend on the health socioeconomic and legal aspects leonel and tonetti 2021 conducted a critical review of wastewater reuse for irrigation and found that wastewater depending on the treatment applied could sometimes be a safer option than conventional water sources for ensuring food safety the soil physico chemical characteristics may be changed by the use of non conventional water even treated which would influence the interrelated network between biotic and abiotic factors and thus affect the microbial community in soils from the aspect of plants fonseca et al 2007 reported an insignificant variation in crop yield when treated wastewater was used as irrigation water however non conventional water reuse may still pose potential risks to plants and or human health due to the accumulation of contaminants in crops especially with high demand for irrigation water for instance as presented in table 3 several heavy metals in non conventional water are toxic to certain plants and human health the treated non conventional water should meet the requirements and standards of water quality for irrigation water the emerging contaminants should also be critically considered for the reuse of domestic sewage as most emerging contaminants cannot be effectively removed by conventional wastewater treatments their existence would result in significant endocrine and hormone problems for human beings lauretta et al 2019 moreover pathogenic microorganisms are an important issue for reusing non conventional in irrigation ofori et al 2021 disinfection byproducts such as clo2 tombini decol et al 2019 also pose significant risks to human health it is thus recommended that the aop treatment technologies should be applied as aops have been shown to be useful to remove both emerging contaminants and pathogenic microorganisms for the environmental aspect foglia et al 2021 conducted a comparative environmental impact analysis and demonstrated that the reclaimed water reuse has more environmental benefits than the direct discharge of treated water this was mainly attributed to avoidance of fertilizer application and direct emissions to surface waterbodies i e nutrients and heavy metals garc√≠a et al 2020 also applied ecological methods to treat and reuse non conventional water in wetland they found that the presence of wetland systems can effectively remove emerging contaminants with lower environmental impacts in addition due to the high frequency and intensity of extreme climate events such as drought and flooding agriculture water resource management will become more difficult it is expected that applying non conventional water for irrigation could increase the resistance of agriculture to climate change the challenges of drought can be compensated by using other alternatives such as the process wastewater and domestic sewage as described in this study in the future the relevant risk assessment and sensitivity analysis for non conventional water reuse as irrigation under global climate change should be performed critically 5 priority research directions perspectives and prospects access to sustainable water services is indispensable for adaptation to climate change in the agricultural sector reclaiming non conventional wastewater for irrigation purposes instead of traditional wastewater treatment is particularly conducive to achieving a circular water economy systematic economic evaluation with sensitivity and reliability analyses should be performed critically considering various factors such as different economic and water prices amos et al 2018 and the payback period kuntz maykot and ghisi 2020 the overall costs of non conventional water reuse systems are mainly the capital collection and operation costs as a result to accelerate the progress of non conventional water reuse in agriculture three priority research directions should be the focus of attention 1 design for efficient collection 2 design for fit for purpose treatment and 3 deployment of energy efficient processes for recovering value added resources and providing a sustainable water service 5 1 utilities for efficient collection of non conventional water the collection and transport of wastewater generally involve a significant portion of energy consumption and thus operating costs of the entire reuse system long distance transportation of water and its related energy consumption conflicts with the essence of resource conservation and responsible consumption for example water head loss occurs during the transportation because of the friction and elbows so that pumps are necessary water loss also occurs during transportation because of evaporation and leakage in the case of rainwater collection runoff harvesting systems are usually deployed near the farmlands to reduce the evaporation loss several parameters such as technology option maintenance and tank size should be fully considered as they are the dominant factors for the overall costs of runoff harvesting systems abdulla 2020 campisano et al 2017 in addition as the concept of environmental sustainability evolves continuously decentralization of non conventional water treatment for various purposes including agriculture is a trend that has received a great deal of attention figure s2 decentralized systems can be built locally to minimize the resource and energy losses compared with conventional practices in line with decentralization a major concern should be the capital investment and land resources however a decentralized water supply system should have lower water transport costs the construction scale facility size and land requirement are comparatively less because the overall wastewater is diverted into several water supply systems 5 2 design for fit for purpose treatment most non conventional water raises concerns about various water quality parameters such as ec ss bod cod nutrients chloride sulfate and bacteria as a number of commercial technologies can be found for different targeted parameters this review summarized several available technologies for removing the key contaminants in fact non conventional water reuse systems should be fit for purpose to minimize the overall operation costs the concept of fit for purpose emphasizes that the quality of treated wastewater can be just suitable for its purpose connor et al 2017 for example the treated water quality does not have to meet drinking water standards if it is to be used for irrigation purposes which would be considered over treated without cost effectiveness this could be easier to achieve in decentralized water supply systems figure s3 unlike the centralized water supply system a local water supply system is able to meet the water quality requirement designated for given purposes and demands such as agricultural use the non conventional water reuse system should be established in farming areas that have the demand for irrigation water supply it is thus suggested that the concept of fit for purpose could be realized more fully through decentralization as the precise amount of energy and chemicals to purify non conventional water could be assessed based on the agricultural use standards 5 3 deployment of energy efficient processes for recovering value added resources non conventional water reuse systems require additional energy and or chemicals to purify wastewater to acceptable levels of water quality which may compensate the benefits of non conventional water reuse therefore it should be coupled with the concept of resource recovery such as organic substances inorganic compounds and nutrients to maximize the revenues from the circular water economy to achieve this goal development and deployment of integrated separation processes are an essential strategy in response to the water and energy nexus under global climate change a major consideration for water reuse technologies is energy efficiency i e from thermodynamic point of view and the impact of the concentrate brine on the discharge environment for instance for non conventional water containing a medium salinity e g 2 5 g l deployment of electrokinetic separation processes would be more energy efficient from the thermodynamic point of view compared to pressure driven or thermal driven approaches pan et al 2020 the concentrated stream from the separation processes could be utilized as a byproduct for further applications in other words in addition to the purified water used for irrigation the concentrated byproduct if reaches the product specification in the market could be sold in the market to obtain additional revenue innovative business models for non conventional water reuse are imperative to achieve a sustainable water service for instance takeuchi and tanaka 2020 indicated that a water reuse business could be economically viable if it utilizes existing water pipelines for purified water supply even though their case studies were for industrial or domestic purposes with this experience we believe that non conventional water reuse systems should be combined with existing water utilities nearby farm lands non conventional water reuse systems not only refer to technologies and infrastructures but also local policies regulations institutions and society that are relevant to the system these factors would have a marked impact on the feasibility of the business models for supporting non conventional water reuse 6 conclusions there is an increasing need for irrigation water because of increasing demand for food appropriate water allocation and water resource management should be developed to meet this requirement this paper first reviewed how people can reuse non conventional water as available irrigation water five types of non conventional water rainfall stormwater runoff cooling water hydraulic fracturing wastewater process wastewater from pulp paper and food industries and domestic sewage were reviewed the results indicate that most of them raise concerns about water quality such as ss bod cod salinity nutrients chloride sulfate bacteria and emerging contaminants as a number of commercial technologies could be found for ss and bod cod this paper summarized the available technologies for monitoring and controlling the key contaminants in wastewater in addition this study addressed potential risks to plants human health the environment and climate change for non conventional water reuse as irrigation water lastly three priority research directions were proposed to achieve better water allocation and water resource management important concepts such as efficient collection of non conventional water fit for purpose treatment and value added resource recovery should be considered for successfully converting non conventional water into available irrigation water declaration

16957,due to the growing and diverse demands on water supply exploitation of non conventional sources of water has received much attention since water consumption for irrigation is the major contributor to total water withdrawal the utilization of non conventional sources of water for the purpose of irrigation is critical to assuring the sustainability of water resources although numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate and manage non conventional water sources little research has reviewed the suitability of available water technologies for improving water quality so that water reclaimed from non conventional supplies could be an alternative water resource for irrigation this article provides a systematic overview of all aspects of regulation technology and management to enable the innovative technology thereby promoting and facilitating the reuse of non conventional water the study first reviews the requirements for water quantity and quality i e physical chemical and biological parameters for agricultural irrigation five candidate sources of non conventional water were evaluated in terms of quantity and quality namely rainfall stormwater runoff industrial cooling water hydraulic fracturing wastewater process wastewater and domestic sewage water quality issues such as suspended solids biochemical chemical oxygen demand total dissolved solids total nitrogen bacteria and emerging contaminates were assessed available technologies for improving the quality of non conventional water were comprehensively investigated the potential risks to plants human health and the environment posed by non conventional water reuse for irrigation are also discussed lastly three priority research directions including efficient collection of non conventional water design of fit for purpose treatment and deployment of energy efficient processes were proposed to provide guidance on the potential for future research graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords irrigation water quality wastewater decentralization nutrients treatment technology 1 introduction water is not only an essential material for human beings 70 of our bodies by weight but also an important resource for human activities such as agriculture commerce industry and domestic use according to the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations un the annual water withdrawal worldwide from natural water bodies is estimated to be around 4250 km3 of which agricultural use is the largest consumer at around 71 7 of the total withdrawal fao 2021 meanwhile global climate change increases the intensity and frequency of droughts and floods posing a significant threat to the sustainability of agricultural production the 17 sustainable development goals sdgs proposed by the un establish the targets for assuring sustainable development including zero hunger sdg 2 and clean water and sanitation sdg 6 in line with the sdgs the world in 2050 report iiasa 2018 suggested six exemplary transformations for achieving long term sustainability by 2050 including resource allocation to solve the issues of food and water the world economic forum also indicated in their global risks report 2020 that water and food crises are among the top 10 long term risks in the impact category over the next 10 years wef 2019 several semi arid and arid areas especially in the middle east and africa hussain et al 2019 now face serious water stress due to limited water sources therefore it is essential to establish alternative sources of water to meet the water scarcity challenges in agriculture non conventional sources of water receive increasing attention due to their potential to reuse water for human activities morote et al 2019 omran 2019 which can alleviate the water scarcity in agriculture while realizing a circular water economy as shown in fig 1 in the present study the circular water economy is defined as the business model that aims to reuse non conventional water as alternative water source for various purposes while extracting valuable resources from non conventional water to realize sustainable production and consumption brears 2020 pieroni et al 2021 potting et al 2017 the concept of sustainable production and consumption was originally derived from waste to resource supply chains that reduce emissions slootweg 2020 mitigate waste chen et al 2017a and enhance the environmental resilience against climate change feng et al 2018 from the perspective of integrated water resource management beneficial reuse of non conventional water deserves attention as a route toward sustainable water supply hussain et al 2019 conventional water is defined as the water resources of the natural processes of the hydrological cycle where water can be taken from rivers streams lakes reservoirs rainfall and aquifers groundwater by contrast non conventional water as shown in fig 2 comes from seawater stormwater agricultural drainage thermoelectric cooling water hydraulic fracturing water industrial processed waste water domestic wastewater and commercial discharges e g hot spring discharge the massive amount of non conventional water provides a promising opportunity to meet the demand for water as we head toward a new era of urbanization a number of countries have started to reuse treated wastewater for crop growing especially in those areas facing severe water shortages such as egypt el kady and el shibini 2001 jordan abu sharar et al 2003 tunisia haddaoui et al 2017 turkey kanber et al 2005 and saudi arabia qadir et al 2007 however most of the sources for irrigation water are still dominated by conventional water in all arab countries the irrigation water from non conventional water sources amounts to no more than 0 3 while surface water and groundwater supply 70 1 and 29 5 respectively dabour 2006 total annual renewable water resources in 2017 were estimated to be about 42 800 billion m3 year knoema 2018 which was more than the total amount of water withdrawn the key problem is how to collect and utilize the resource appropriately the sources of non conventional water are diverse with significant variation in quality domestic sewage contains pathogenic bacteria cui et al 2019 while seawater and salt groundwater has higher salinity which cannot be used for irrigation without prior treatment bonnelye et al 2004 using non conventional water without proper treatment for irrigation not only impairs plant growth but also causes public health issues since non conventional water may include toxic substances or pathogenic bacteria thus combinations of water reuse technologies are required to support the utilization of non conventional water studies have evaluated the management of non conventional water in different countries such as spain morote et al 2019 china smith et al 2018 south africa mutamba 2017 and egypt omran 2019 several technologies have been developed for non conventional water reuse for different purposes including bio sand filtering of un treated irrigation water li et al 2015 nabila 2015 despite the recent progress little research has been conducted on the performance of water technologies in improving water quality for non conventional water reuse in agriculture this article provides a systematic overview of the regulatory technological and management aspects to enable the adoption of technological innovations in the reuse of non conventional water in line with the sdgs to explore the potential of non conventional water reuse in agriculture the water quality required for agricultural irrigation is reviewed first several non conventional water sources namely stormwater cooling water from power generation hydraulic fracturing wastewater process wastewater and domestic sewage are evaluated in terms of their quantity and quality a number of available technologies for improving the quality of non conventional water are reviewed lastly three priority research directions are proposed 2 water resource management in agriculture 2 1 water use in agriculture water use in agriculture is the most significant of all activities that require water according to the latest data from fao fao 2021 the water withdrawal for agricultural purposes accounts for 71 7 of total water consumption worldwide this proportion is even higher in arid and semi arid countries for example the annual water withdrawals for agriculture in north africa sub saharan africa the arabian peninsula and the middle east are around 85 8 100 2 28 6 and 229 7 km3 or 78 6 78 8 80 7 and 86 3 of the total water withdrawal respectively fao 2021 with population growth the demand for food has grown remarkably and more farming areas and effective agricultural practices are needed to meet growing demand unfortunately the overall amount of conventional water available worldwide remains steady and increasing the area devoted to agriculture requires additional non conventional water resources according to un fao less than 10 of irrigated land uses non conventional water worldwide this proportion should be increased to meet the growing demand for water in the future furthermore the agricultural water withdrawal is around 59 of total renewable water resources fao 2021 in other words more than half of all renewable water resources are needed to meet agricultural purposes 2 2 importance of water quality in agriculture table 1 presents the classification of important water quality parameters and their benchmarks for agricultural irrigation unfavorable levels of ph electrical conductivity ec and oil interfere with the absorption of nutrients by plants a previous study indicated that ec significantly affects crop productivity ding et al 2018 the crops of onions potatoes and dry beans were shown to have a 50 yield reduction for irrigation water with ec higher than 2900 3900 and 2400 ¬µs cm respectively high biochemical oxygen demand bod or chemical oxygen demand cod in water consumes dissolved oxygen do and inhibits plant growth halogens such as chlorine and fluorine can cause damage to the surface tissues of plants most of the regulated heavy metals have different impacts on various crops and tend to accumulate in soil so that the integrity of the ecological system is threatened some heavy metals cause adverse health effects in human beings and the utilization of water containing heavy metals for irrigation should be controlled sodium adsorption ratio sar and residual sodium carbonate rsc indices indicate the sodium hazard and high levels indicate the possible replacement of calcium and magnesium by sodium changing the configuration of soil and affecting soil permeability and crop growth 2 3 regulatory standards in irrigation water quality table 2 summarizes the standards and or recommendations of irrigation water quality in a number of different countries in general ph should be in the range 6 0 8 0 while ec exhibits a broad range from 300 in japan up to 7000 ¬µs cm in tunisia suspended solids ss are not allowed to exceed 100 mg l in a number of asian countries while it is regulated in the range of 10 30 mg l for countries in the middle east north africa and europe a few asian countries regulate the do to be higher than 2 5 mg l both taiwan and egypt have the standard of oil and grease for irrigation water at the concentration of 5 0 mg l a number of asian countries have a more stringent standard i e an order lower for bod cod and total nitrogen tn eighteen heavy metals are regulated in most of the countries depending on their toxicity and chemical characteristics for example the standard of iron fe ranges up to 5 mg l while the limit for mercury hg is only 0 001 0 002 mg l except for lithium li and selenium se the us has different standards for long term and short term exposures as most heavy metals accumulate in the soil several metals such as cobalt co have two orders of difference between the standards for short and long terms generally most of the regulation for the metals does not differ significantly among the countries table 3 presents the regulated biological aqueous standards used for irrigation the standards in the investigated countries can be classified into two different categories i e low and high depending on the target plants generally the low standard is for the edible crops that require cooking before ingestion while the high standard is for vegetables or fruits that can be digested directly fecal coliform and e coli which are related to the feces are the most common indicators used in regulation a number of countries have more stringent bacteria control standards than that suggested by who in order to maintain a healthy environment bacteria are not allowed to be detected in several countries such as south korea and the us because of their high standards for bacterial residues several other countries have a high bacteria standard between 5 and 250 cfu while a few countries set limits in the range of 200 10 000 cfu 3 sources of non conventional water in the present study a number of sources of non conventional water are explored namely stormwater runoff cooling water hydraulic fracturing water industrial process water e g pulp paper and food industries and domestic wastewater the quality and quantity of these sources are systematically discussed 3 1 rainfall and stormwater runoff rainfall and stormwater runoff are one type of non conventional water source that can be used for irrigation purpose however significant quantities of them directly flow into the surface water bodies such as rivers and are not readily accessible for further application if they were collected properly rainfall and stormwater runoff are a potential water source and usually do not require advanced treatment prior to irrigation collected rainfall or stormwater runoff can be even used as the alternative water resource in the dry season therefore different types of rainfall collection also known as runoff harvesting have been developed and widely employed abas and mahlia 2019 bashar et al 2018 yannopoulos et al 2019 rainfall collection systems can be located on the roof of a building for the purposes of home planting or toilet devkota et al 2015 be placed in the large scale raft foundation underneath airports and schools antunes and ghisi 2020 tzanakakis et al 2020 and even be installed as a ridge furrow rainfall harvesting system for direct irrigation zhang et al 2020 important parameters for successful runoff harvesting include the terrain and soil properties for the terrain a deep area is preferable to collect a large amount of precipitation and a steep slope enables the maximum collection of rainwater the soil should be of low permeability in the catchment area or a waterproof cover is required soil of a high permeability can be used for the connection between the catchment and the application farmland in general runoff harvesting systems are deployed near the farmlands that need irrigation as shown in figure s1 to reduce the evaporation loss yosef and asmamaw 2015 in some cases rainwater harvesting systems require on site containers such as barrels pipes and other auxiliaries which impact the ecosystem and the overall environmental impacts should be critically addressed 3 2 cooling water cooling water is used in boilers and cooling towers which are widely used in thermoelectric power plants and various other industries such as pulp and paper iron and steel and petroleum it accounts for 70 80 of total industrial water usage wang et al 2006 in the us the cooling water used in thermoelectric power generation amounts to approximately 196 billion gallons per day bauer et al 2014 thereby having significant potential to meet the needs of irrigation from alternative sources after several recirculating cycles cooling water is discharged in order to prevent corrosion deposition and biofilm formation ouyang et al 2006 the corrosion and deposition issues are mainly attributed to the alkalinity hardness and microbial induced parameters of cooling water kokilaramani et al 2021 which correspond to its high calcium and magnesium concentrations in the aqueous phase as presented in table s1 fig 3 shows a few selected water quality indices of cooling water although alkalinity is not a regulated standard of irrigation water it does cause damage to plants and impairs to the environment high alkaline water can cause lime deposition and pipe plugging in the irrigation system lime deposition may precipitate nutrients and affect their fate in the soil hopkins et al 2007 the presence of high sulfate and chloride accelerates the deposition as they often combine with ca2 and mg2 to form the insoluble inorganic substances resulting in high tds 1342 1482 mg l and ec 1500 3620 ¬µs cm as a result desalination is often suggested for cooling water treatment bacteria also pose a concern when reusing cooling water pan et al 2018c as the microbial concentration often exceeds the regulated standard as the cooling water remains in the system bacteria grow and accumulate causing several health concerns that need considering when reusing cooling water for irrigation purposes 3 3 hydraulic fracturing wastewater natural gas attracts great attentions due to its high efficiency and environmentally friendly characteristics in the process of generating electricity mojid et al 2021 among the diverse sources of natural gas shale gas has promising potential and its production share increased from 2 2000 to 23 2010 of the total us natural gas production administration 2012 shale gas production reached about 13 5 trillion cubic feet in 2014 eia 2014 and is expected to increase in the future the global natural gas supply should grow by 69 from 2012 to 2040 to meet the increasing demand for natural gas conti et al 2016 in line with increasing demand of shale gas the wastewater generated from the production processes will also increase generally hydraulic fracturing a process injecting a huge amount of pressurized water into the wellbore is a common method to release shale gas stringfellow et al 2014 however massive amounts of wastewater i e hydraulic fracturing water is generated during after the operation period the generation rate can be as high as 1000 m3 day at the initial stage and decreases gradually after it stabilizes the wastewater generation would be around 2 8 m3 day gregory et al 2011 on average the wastewater production from hydraulic fracturing worldwide is 250 million barrels per day torres et al 2016 which could be reused in agriculture if the fracking wastewater is subjected to proper treatment processes table s2 summarizes the selected water quality parameters of hydraulic fracturing water around the world and their graphical presentation is shown in fig 4 the concentrations of cl and na are higher than the respective standards for irrigation water leading to high ec sar and tds such high concentrations also imply that hydraulic fracturing water cannot be used for irrigation without proper treatment or the water absorption ability of plants and soil permeability would decrease meanwhile its bod and cod are also higher than the regulated standards because of the dissolution of organic matters from the soil during the hydraulic fracturing process given the high tn content in the hydraulic fracturing wastewater it may also need denitrification all the heavy metals content in the hydraulic fracturing water are lower than the respective standards for irrigation water except for iron the iron comes from the soil and must be removed to meet the water quality requirement for irrigation purposes 3 4 process wastewater pulp paper and food industries among the industries other than those generating cooling water and fracturing wastewater the pulp and paper industry produces the most wastewater the pulp and paper industry generates wastewater at a rate of around 300 000 400 000 l ton while other industries produce less than 300 000 l ton ranade and bhandari 2014 however the quantities of process wastewater generated in the pulp paper industries varied from country to country therefore the suitability of process wastewater as the alternative irrigation water resource is questionable in terms of quantity depending on the development of the country in the study by soloman et al 2009 the cod 925 mg l and bod 102 mg l in the pulp and paper wastewater effluent were higher than the effluent standards due to extensive use of organic solvents in the manufacturing process another reason for high organic content is the carbohydrate constituents of wood the literature also reports that the cod in the effluent from the pulp and paper industry is around 1248 mg l tarlan et al 2002 and 1400 mg l vieira et al 2001 another concern is the solids dissolved or in suspension in the wastewater the ss contents can be up to 570 mg l which is higher than the regulated standard 100 mg l the high conductivity in the range of 2860 5600 ¬µs cm implies the possible issue of dissolved solids pizzichini et al 2005 soloman et al 2009 for the dissolved solids the chloride and sulfate attract most attention because their aqueous concentrations are often above the regulation level pizzichini et al 2005 in contrast with this sodium magnesium and calcium do not cause any problem as the sar is within the acceptable range of 5 8 7 2 in addition the coliform bacteria in the pulp and paper wastewater is usually within the range of 1 2 3 5 108 cfu 100 ml which are well within the regulation levels gauthier et al 2000 the food industry is quite heterogeneous including mills that process dairy meat olive oil and other products the wastewater from those mills can be very diverse in quantity and quality for example wine and vinegar industrial wastewater has the wastewater generation factor around 11 46 m3 ton while that for dairy products it is in the range 3 10 m3 ton doorn et al 1997 the variation in these factors depends on the regional development plan generally the wastewater from the food industry contains high cod bod and ss that require further treatment prior to irrigation use connor et al 2017 for instance dairy wastewater has the maximum cod of about 95 g l wang and serventi 2019 which is higher than the regulated standard table 2 similar results were found by di berardino et al 2000 who indicated the cod between 530 2620 mg l in the food industrial wastewater most food production leads to organic matters of proteins lipids or carbohydrates as bod cod in the wastewater meanwhile the nutrients of nitrogen and phosphate are observed in different food industries such as brewing and dairy connor et al 2017 when applied in the appropriate quantity using wastewater from the food industry for irrigation is another method for facilitating nutrient recycling however industrial production of meat products releases wastewater containing nitrogen 2740 mg l above the regulated standard cristian 2010 on the other hand the discharge from food companies has high levels of sodium and chloride ions the salt additives are the major source of these ions that impact on plant growth when such wastewater is used for irrigation proper treatment for oil removal is also required because oil is another issue of food industry waste as most food e g meat diary cheese vegetable oil contains fats affandi et al 2014 nisola et al 2009 on the other hand the wastewater discharge from vegetable processing facilities may contain pesticide and fertilizer residues so that such wastewater can be beneficial to plant farming when used for irrigation with well controlled practice connor et al 2017 with the presence of nutrients bacteria can grow vigorously in the wastewater causing another issue for the re utilization of reclaimed water g√ºzel seydim et al 2004 3 5 domestic sewage domestic sewage comprises the used water from our daily routines such as toilets cooking dish washing and plant watering generally domestic sewage can be divided into gray water and black water gray water is composed of the wastewater from the activities of showering laundry and dish washing while black water includes urine flush water feces and toilet flush al hamaiedeh and bino 2010 boutin and eme 2016 memon and butler 2006 found that the proportions of daily routine water consumption for water closet washing machine kitchen sink and bath were about 31 20 15 and 15 respectively the average daily water consumption per person varies from country to country and is highly related to the economic development habits water resource availability population and climatic characteristics to increase the available water resource for irrigation domestic sewage can be considered as supplementary irrigation water in countries where daily water consumption is high and the wastewater can be reclaimed to supply the irrigation water for example countries with high water consumption are the us 575 l day capita followed by australia 493 l day capita italy 386 l day capita japan 374 l day capita and mexico 366 l day capita fig 5 shows the selected water quality indices of domestic sewage one concern for reusing domestic sewage is the ss most of the ss content in domestic sewage is high so that domestic sewage should not be used for irrigation purpose without proper treatment grisolia et al 2005 lado and ben hur 2009 domestic sewage also contains organic matter that is considered beneficial to growing plants however the situation can be totally different if the bod cod exceeds the upper limit for irrigation water especially when it contains toilet flush black water and kitchen discharge in which the cod is around 2 3 orders above the irrigation criterion kujawa roeleveld et al 2006 high bod cod causes the depletion of dissolved oxygen and trace metals can reduce the absorption of nutrients nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate from detergents are also beneficial to the growth of crops however excessive nutrients in the irrigation water may result in eutrophication and overgrowth of crops the tn of the toilet flush and kitchen discharge typically ranges between 1600 and 3000 mg l kujawa roeleveld et al 2006 which is the main source of nutrients in domestic sewage other ions such as chloride and sulfate ions are also high in domestic sewage making it inappropriate for irrigation purposes table s3 the possible sources of the aqueous chloride and sulfate are salts which are used extensively for seasoning food rsc is also above the regulated standard and excessive rsc alters the characteristics of soil and impacts plant growth the pathogenic bacteria and viruses in domestic sewage are another issue of concern there is a huge amount of e coli in the feces of human beings as the toilet flush is a part of domestic sewage the number of e coli 8 5 106 cfu per 100 ml can be several times higher than the criterion suggested by who tawfik et al 2003 causing health concerns when eating crops furthermore domestic sewage contains various types of emerging contaminants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs and antibiotic resistant genes args ghattas et al 2017 which cannot be degraded naturally thomaidi et al 2015 the concentrations of a number of emerging contaminants have been found to be high in domestic sewage such as 17Œ± ethinylestradiol diethylstilbestrol lei et al 2020 4 tert octylphenol bisphenol a 4 nonylphenol chen et al 2020 teta bird et al 2019 tetx belding and boopathy 2018 and meca boopathy 2017 4 technologies for non conventional water reuse table s4 summarizes concerns for the reviewed wastewater as the source for irrigation water 4 1 monitoring systems it is important to apply necessary monitoring and or detection technologies for non conventional water reuse to evaluate the quantity and quality of pollutants in water and soils and thus adjust the operating conditions of treatment processes according to the real situation for instance noticed adverse environmental impacts inhibiting the widespread application of wastewater reuse as irrigation mainly arise from the nutrients and salt content in the treated wastewater a number of detection technologies have been developed and deployed for monitoring different water quality parameters such as heavy metals syu et al 2020 nutrients leonel and tonetti 2021 human enteric viruses and coliphages truchado et al 2021 leonel and tonetti 2021 suggested that periodic monitoring of nutrients in treated non conventional water should be deployed to avoid imbalance in the supply of nutrients as the amount of nutrients in wastewater varies significantly the monitoring of water quality parameters using distributed smart sensors should also be integrated with efficient models to optimize non conventional water reuse singh 2021 also fonseca et al 2007 suggested that the monitoring of soil quality following the application of treated wastewater is imperative to sustain food quality 4 2 control and treatment of major contaminants attention should be paid to the ec coupled with the two anions cl and so4 2 since the observed ec may exceed the irrigation water quality standard and a similar situation also occurs with the indices of bacteria and bod cod among the five investigated categories of wastewater three were found to have issues concerning ec bod cod and bacteria suspended solids are present in a number of sources of non conventional wastewater such as domestic sewage hydraulic fracturing water and the wastewater from the pulp and paper industry specific attention should be paid to domestic sewage hydraulic fracturing water and food industry wastewater in terms of the nitrogen problem other concerns such as oil heavy metals and sar are present in several special cases suspended solids in non conventional wastewater can be reduced by a number of commercial technologies such as sedimentation song et al 2000 coagulation bukhari 2008 ebeling et al 2003 and filtration mulligan et al 2009 this is also the case for bod cod which is a legacy pollutant and there are a lot of available treatment technologies for bod cod removal including membrane filtration hube et al 2020 coagulation zhao et al 2021a adsorption shawwa et al 2001 biological degradation bhat and gogate 2021 and chemical oxidation blonskaja et al 2006 in the present study we focus on the treatment technologies for removing salinity ammonia nitrogen and bacteria which are the major concerns for most of the candidate water sources larger or equal to the regulated level and shown by three solid dots in table s4 4 2 1 desalination to date many desalination technologies have been developed and applied to remove excess ions and or salts from water fig 6 shows the expected time to commercialization for various types of desalination technologies the earliest technology of desalination was distillation which started in the 1960s al shammiri and safar 1999 in general the principle of distillation based desalination is to separate the water from salt by the difference in their boiling points the water is vaporized and condensed while the dissolved salts precipitate out in the distillation process el dessouky et al 1999 advanced distillation technologies have incorporated renewable energy such as solar power singh et al 2020 residual heat gonz√°lez et al 2017 and geothermal energy sarbatly and chiam 2013 to reduce the energy cost another often used technology for desalination is membrane filtration and it is often applied to seawater and brackish groundwater desalination lee et al 2011 wang et al 2008 the operation can be divided into various categories based on the pore sizes and characteristics of the filters membranes including microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro the key point of this technology is to differentiate the salt and water molecules on the basis of size generally mf and uf are used for solid removal as the size of the salts are smaller than the pore size jiang et al 2013 investigated three pore sizes mfs i e 1 4 0 8 and 0 2 ¬µm for their performance in removing tss and conductivity from hydraulic fracturing water the best performance was the one with the smallest pore size 0 2 ¬µm but the removal ratio of conductivity was only 2 7 although the tss removal ratio can be up to 100 another study tested the performance of desalination of cooling water from industrial application by uf and found the rejection rate was only 23 davood abadi farahani et al 2016 a similar study by xu et al 2007 found that the conductivity was slightly reduced from 39 000 47 680 to 38 000 42 000 ¬µs cm after uf treatment which did not meet the water quality standard for irrigation the treatment performance of nf depends on the pore size and it has been found that nf with small pore size had the removal ratio of 51 7 while only 19 5 was obtained by using the nf with large pore size kaya et al 2015 in the test the ions including na mg2 ca2 cl and so4 2 which were the main salts present in the selected non conventional wastewater were examined the results indicated that the removal ratios were 50 0 96 9 95 5 56 3 and 99 2 respectively with the small pore size nf while the removal ratios achieved by the large pore size nf were 15 4 98 8 97 5 21 9 and 98 8 respectively the ions with multiple charges could be efficiently removed by nf this treatment technology may be adapted to treat the cooling wastewater from industrial applications which often contains ca2 mg2 and so4 2 although mf uf and nf did not demonstrate excellent desalination performance like ro they were considered to be effective pre treatment for ro since they could remove large particles in the wastewater without pre treatment the ro system is subject to fouling more frequently for desalination ro is frequently used because of its high salt rejection ratio lee et al 2011 the treatment efficiency for cooling water from industrial application by ro was investigated by davood abadi farahani et al 2016 the ec was reduced from 2928 to 76 ¬µs cm a rejection ratio of 97 using ro without any pre treatment another study also examined the treatment efficiency of a single ro membrane and displayed a 97 reduction of ec and tds the corresponding removal ratios of na mg2 ca2 cl and so4 2 by ro were 98 0 99 6 99 0 98 0 and 99 8 respectively kaya et al 2015 in other words the removal ratios of salinity using ro were promising and could be successfully applied to desalination however a costly high pressure application is required at the feed to force the water molecules through ro membrane during operation qadir et al 2007 also the disposal of the brine solution was a problem in the ro operation morillo et al 2014 compared with ro distillation technology generates better quality water than ro the levels of dissolved solids produced in distillation are several orders less than those in ro qadir et al 2007 the operation and maintenance for distillation are also easier as ro needs regular replacement of the membrane and materials and the pre treatment for distillation is easier as well the suspended particles need to be removed before the untreated water is subject to the ro process however ro has a lower energy cost than distillation and the cost of ro is expected to be even lower as new energy recovery systems are developed skuse et al 2021 a recently developed membrane application technology is forward osmosis fo unlike ro which needs high pressure at the inflow fo requires nearly no additional pressure and that reduces the operation costs significantly eyvaz et al 2018 the principle of fo is to create a draw solution which has higher osmotic pressure than the incoming solution the water molecule penetrates into the draw solution through the membrane to achieve desalination akther et al 2015 however the draw solution is mainly produced by the salts so that desalination is still required after the operation the solution for the fatal drawback of fo is yet to be found other than filtration and distillation a number of electrochemical technologies can be applied for desalination such as electrodialysis ed electrodeionization edi and capacitive deionization cdi ed includes a membrane in the system but the driving force is not pressurized instead electricity is employed as the driving force the membrane used in this system is a selective membrane which only allows cations or anions to pass through after energizing the electrodes the cations and anions are attracted by the anode and cathode respectively mohammadi and kaviani 2003 confirmed that a tds ec removal ratio above 98 could be achieved under optimal operating conditions a flow rate of 0 3 ml s and a voltage of 6 v with the influx concentration of 30 000 mg l another study by adhikary et al 1991 examined the influence of inlet tds concentration and flow rate on the desalination performance by ed the result showed that the tds reduction ratio decreased if the flow rate was reduced and the inlet tds concentration increased the reduction efficiency was 83 3 a high flowrate of 9 0 l hr 93 5 a low flowrate of 4 8 l hr for a low inlet tds concentration 6000 mg l while it increased to 43 9 70 8 for high inlet tds concentration 36 000 mg l the voltage effect was evaluated by for seawater desalination and they found that the required operating time to meet the drinking water standard for nacl was decreased from 70 minutes to 27 minutes by increasing the voltage from 9 v to 18 v the removal efficiency was enhanced from 50 0 to 98 5 while the influx nacl concentration increased from 1 g l to 35 g l at the compromise of longer treatment times i e increasing from 17 minutes to 150 minutes an edi system has a similar configuration to that in ed and the major difference is the replacement of the selective membrane in ed by ion exchange resin in edi the advantage of using ion exchange resin is that the regeneration process does not need any chemicals and the conductivity between compartments is increased which generates purer water strathmann 2010 the edi consisting of a layer of weak acid resin and another of strong base resin ratio 1 2 was tested by shen et al 2014 who found a removal efficiency of ec 99 9 after 12 hours in the second layer which is the brine effluent the ec gradually increased from the start of the experiment the effluent from the first layer exhibited a breakthrough time around 8 hours another study reported that the salt removal ratio could be up to 98 99 pan et al 2018b a continuous type edi was investigated and found that the reduction ratio of ec was 97 4 coupled with ion concentrations below 4 ¬µg l ca2 mg2 na cl no3 and so4 2 song et al 2005 advanced edi configurations were developed to stabilize the quality of water produced and further increase the conductivity of the compartment for instance the feed water was introduced into the ion conductive material which was placed between two ion exchange membranes pan et al 2018a zheng et al 2018 investigated the desalination performance by wafer enhanced edi and indicated that 90 and 99 9 salinity removal ratios were attained at 35 and 90 minutes respectively with a voltage of 10 1 v with the initial salinity concentration of 3 g l a removal ratio of 94 4 99 9 was achieved in all the experiments after 90 minutes similar observations were also reported by pan et al 2017 another electrochemical technology for desalination is cdi which is a membrane free technology using ion adsorbed electrodes with high surface area and voltage to hold ions oren 2008 mossad et al 2013 used cdi to perform desalination on brackish water with various flow rates the tds removal efficiency was found to be 86 at a flow rate of 1 l min while only 65 removal efficiency was achieved at a flow rate of 9 l min three ions ca2 mg2 and na were measured and the removal efficiencies were around 87 86 and 73 for a flow rate of 1 l min respectively the impact of a novel mno2 nanoporous carbon composite on the treatment efficiency was also investigated yang et al 2011 salinity removal efficiency was 81 5 which was higher than that of activated carbon 26 1 the adsorption capacity 16 9 ¬µmol g of this material was also larger than that of activated carbon 5 4 ¬µmol g another electrode constructed by ordered mesoporous carbon carbon nanotube composite was used for electrode fabrication peng et al 2012 it was found that around 80 of ec reduction was observed while only around 20 removal can be achieved by commercial activated carbon after 2 hours of operation the performance of a carbon nanotube electrode can be further enhanced by adding additional composites such as polyaniline yan et al 2012 and polyacrylic acid nie et al 2012 4 2 2 denitrifying generally nitrogen reduction in wastewater is achieved through biological reactions and conventional treatments such as coagulation do not significantly remove nitrogen a previous study using three different coagulants for nitrogen removal showed that the removal efficiency of ammonium nitrogen nh3 n was only 17 aguilar et al 2002 nitrogen rejection technologies of membrane filtration are always accompanied by biological treatment such as aerated biofilm reactor terada et al 2003 and anoxic aerobic bioreactor wang et al 2005 a sequencing batch reactor sbr coupled with activated sludge was explored by wang et al 2009 who used domestic wastewater containing tn of 37 mg l and showed 83 removal efficiency on the tn rejection similar results were also reported in the literature jin et al 2012 wei et al 2014 that 87 8 of the tn was removed by the sbr activated sludge process abattoir wastewater with high nitrogen content i e 1057 mg l tkn was treated by the sbr activated sludge process and more than 97 reduction of tkn observed cassidy and belia 2005 a previous study demonstrated that the dominant microbial species for nitrogen reduction in the sludge were ammonia oxidizing bacteria bassin et al 2011 nitrite oxidizing bacteria pronk et al 2014 and denitrification bacteria di bella and torregrossa 2013 gupta and gupta 2001 employed a three stage rotating biological contactor rbc to remove nitrogen from domestic sewage its performance was affected by the initial nitrogen concentration for a given hydraulic retention time the tn reduction would drop from 82 5 to 46 9 when the initial tn concentration was reduced from 110 8 mg l to 54 4 mg l another study employed a two stage rbc to treat municipal wastewater containing tn concentrations of 39 118 mg l and the effluent tn concentration was observed around 12 64 mg l indicating the removal efficiency of 27 7 78 5 hiras et al 2004 the effect of hydraulic retention time on the performance of the rbc for nitrogen reduction was evaluated by gupta and gupta 1999 and the results revealed that a longer residence time 20 7 33 0 reduction for 9 18 days resulted in less efficient performance on nitrogen reduction than a shorter residence time 48 1 68 6 reduction for 6 8 days for anaerobic treatment the anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox process is frequently used to remove nitrogen anammox had only 10 of the operational cost of a conventional system jetten et al 2001 unlike the traditional nitrification and denitrification processes anammox uses ammonia and nitrite as reactants to convert nitrogen into nitrogen gas by autotrophic bacteria around 80 90 nitrogen was converted to nitrogen gas while the rest became nitrate capodaglio et al 2016 as a result partial transference from ammonia into nitrite but not into nitrate called partial nitrification was required for the anammox process the reactor configuration can be divided into two reactor and one reactor systems depending on the combination or separation of these two steps partial oxidation and anammox paredes et al 2007 g√ºven et al 2004 tested the performance of anammox with a continuous flow single reactor the removal ratios of ammonium and nitrite after 262 days were over 90 and 99 respectively resulting a tn concentration reduction of 87 the reduction ratio can be elevated 90 reduction of tn concentration if the retention time is increased 272 511 days anammox using a single rbc reactor was performed by siegrist et al 1998 and the nitrogen removal ratio was around 0 4 1 2 kg n m2 d similar result was found by pynaert et al 2002 who used the similar configuration to obtain 1 55 kg n m2 d an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb digestion was adopted for anammox application and had an 86 5 92 3 removal efficiency for tn with a retention time of 389 400 days the nitrogen removal ratio was 2 28 6 39 kg n m3 d imajo et al 2004 different reactor types including fluidized bed and fixed bed were examined by strous et al 1997 both configurations had excellent reduction performance on the nitrite 99 while 84 and 88 removal efficiency of ammonium were achieved by the fluidized bed and fixed bed respectively as indicated previously two reactor configuration consisted of one partial nitrification reactor and one anammox reactor the up air flow continuous stirred tank reactor cstr coupled with sbr were used for partial nitrification and anammox fux et al 2002 overall a 90 removal ratio were found at the effluent with negligible sludge production the rate determining step for the entire system was the partial nitrification a similar cstr sbr configuration was adopted by van dongen et al 2001 who found that only 53 of ammonia was converted into nitrite at the first reactor which was promising for activating anammox over 80 of the inflow ammonia was successfully converted into nitrogen gas anammox technology is one of the state of the art technologies for removing nitrogen from wastewater nowadays ahn 2006 4 2 3 disinfection the disinfection process is critical to the reuse of reclaimed water since it is directly related to the public health issue in some cases non conventional water may contain bacteria and viruses and require disinfection in the conventional wastewater treatment process coagulation can be a general microbial removal technology sozzi et al 2015 explored the efficiencies of two coagulants i e hydrated lime and aluminum sulfate in microbial removal after treatment the coliforms were reduced from 17 500 to 5 cfu 100 ml and from 49 800 to 106 cfu 100 ml for hydrated lime and aluminum sulfate respectively both coagulants could remove more than 99 of bacteria similar results were found by meri√ß et al 2002 who used ca oh 2 as a coagulant to achieve 73 removal efficiency for e coli and 81 for all coliforms on the other hand feso4 coagulant can produce a removal ratio of 96 99 for both e coli and total coliforms a combination of ca oh 2 and feso4 was applied as an integrated coagulant in different ph conditions and dosages 98 99 e coli and total coliforms reduction were achieved filtration is also a commonly used technology for removing microbial organisms g√≥mez et al 2006 studied the efficiency of various filtration systems on the reduction of fecal coliform and e coli for the disk filter and pressure sand filter systems the removal ratio for both fecal coliform and e coli were around 31 36 which was not efficient enough microfiltration mf performed excellently on microorganism reduction 99 8 for fecal coliform and 100 for e coli the uf process also achieved 99 998 and 100 reductions for fecal coliform and e coli respectively similar uf research by zhang et al 2006 indicated that the uf could not only reduce the turbidity and cod but also remove the total bacteria with a removal efficiency of up to 98 7 in another study three different filtration systems were investigated and the results showed that the effluents of dual media filters and cartridge filters still contained 80 90 of the initial bacteria concentration however the ro filtration system can have a bacteria removal efficiency of above 99 leparc et al 2007 uasb was investigated by tawfik et al 2003 and its removal ratio of e coli was around 54 86 depending on the operating temperature rbc was found to have an efficiency of 69 removal for e coli moreover the combination of uasb and rbc could achieve 92 5 e coli removal at 30 c different from anaerobic treatment a fixed film aerobic process was examined by pant and mittal 2007 and the fecal coliform decreased from 3010 000 to 46 800 mpn 100 ml after the aerobic process with 98 2 removal efficiency a similar result was reported by uemura et al 2002 that the fixed film aerobic process had fecal coliform reduction ratio of 98 6 the activated sludge plant was investigated to have over 99 fecal coliform reduction average 25 000 000 to 130 000 cfu 100 ml the aerobic process was found to be more efficient in microbial reduction than anaerobic treatment for disinfection chlorine is the most popular agent used in water wastewater treatment plants a number of studies show its high removal efficiency nearly 100 on e coli sobsey 1989 and fecal coliform pant and mittal 2007 however the critical concern of chlorine disinfection is the generation of process by products including trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids which have attracted attention because of their adverse effects on the public health gopal et al 2007 nieuwenhuijsen et al 2000 peracetic acid or peroxyacetic acid paa is an alternative oxidant to chlorine for disinfection ao et al 2021 it can release oxygen molecules with a high oxidation potential paa can damage the microbial catalase and further inactivate the microorganism block 2001 previous studies showed that paa results in over 99 99 removal ratio for e coli fecal coliform and total coliform within 5 20 minutes kitis 2004 the disadvantages include raised levels of bod cod because paa is an organic molecule which impairs the water quality and facilitates the growth of bacteria and microorganisms in the receiving water body iron another popular disinfectant not only acts as a coagulant but also as a disinfectant in wastewater treatment the iron can trigger the fenton reaction which is recognized as an advanced oxidation process aop that can degrade organic contaminants pignatello et al 2006 sharma et al 2005 used iron as a disinfectant and found that over 99 of e coli was killed at the iron dosage of 20 50 ¬µm similar results were found by waite 1979 when the addition of ferrate significantly decreased the concentration of total bacteria fecal coliform and total coliform by 91 99 99 and 99 98 respectively another popular reagent used for disinfection is ozone silva et al 2010 explored the ozone disinfection efficiency in wastewater treatment at various dosages 5 10 mg l and contact times 5 15 minutes the results revealed that the inactivation rate of total coliform was 2 2 3 7 log kill while 2 6 4 3 log kill of e coli occurred demonstrating a satisfactory performance for disinfection for physical treatment processes ultraviolet light received a great deal of attention due to its high disinfection efficiency without byproduct formation hijnen et al 2006 ultraviolet light can damage the dna of microorganisms grossweiner and smith 1989 a number of studies demonstrated that the maximum disinfection effect occurred at the ultraviolet wavelength of 260 nm as the radiation could be absorbed by most of the dnas of microorganisms song et al 2016 99 of fecal coliform reduction was achieved at 20 40 c at the applied radiation dose of 54 60 ¬µws cm2 abu ghararah 1994 a similar result of 99 reduction on 14 bacteria and three viruses was observed by johnson et al 2010 4 2 4 advanced processes for emerging contaminants emerging contaminants such as pharmaceutical and personal care products persistent organic compounds and microplastics ofori et al 2021 may not be efficiently removed by conventional water treatment plants and thus would pose potential risks to reuse for irrigation recently several technologies have been developed and applied for removing emerging contaminants from wastewater for instance advanced oxidation processes aops such as ozonation and fenton reaction were found to exhibit good performance on the removal of edcs ghernaout and elboughdiri 2020 si et al 2019 found that the colloidal 17Œ≤ estradiol estriol 17Œ± ethunylestradiol cannot be detected after ozonation similarly over 80 of soluble edcs were found to be effectively removed by the ozonation process huang et al 2019 for the fenton reaction sharma et al 2016 found an average of 2 42 5 log removal ratio on the args in addition to aop a membrane bioreactor mbr is effective in removing emerging contaminants ahmed et al 2017 a number of edcs such as triclosan and atendol can be effectively reduced by over 97 varjani and chaithanya sudha 2018 wang et al 2020 also demonstrated that the average cell free args can be completely removed by mbr catalytic processes are also an effective approach to removing emerging contaminants from wastewater for instance the magnetic carbon nanocomposites have been developed for 4 nitrophenol degradation with the achievable removal efficiency of around 90 using the catalyst dosage of 0 08 g l chen et al 2017b after treatment the magnetic catalysts could be easily recovered and regenerated simply by a magnet other kinds of magnetic nanocomposite catalysts such as fe3o4 au kou et al 2020 fe3o4 cu w zhao et al 2021b and cu cufe2o4 zheng et al 2020 have been developed the removal efficiency of emerging contaminants can be up to 96 7 by the fe3o4 au catalyst kou et al 2020 moreover the nanocomposite catalyst can be adopted on the electrodes incorporated with electrochemical treatment fadillah et al 2019 or be used in other detection and photocatalysis processes wu et al 2021 these processes usually have removal efficiencies of over 95 for emerging contaminants and are promising for future practical applications 4 3 systematic assessment for irrigation using non conventional water systematic assessment from various aspects such as plants environment human health and climate change should be critically considered and addressed to avoid potential risks salgot and folch 2018 suggested that besides the options of available technologies the reuse of reclaimed water should depend on the health socioeconomic and legal aspects leonel and tonetti 2021 conducted a critical review of wastewater reuse for irrigation and found that wastewater depending on the treatment applied could sometimes be a safer option than conventional water sources for ensuring food safety the soil physico chemical characteristics may be changed by the use of non conventional water even treated which would influence the interrelated network between biotic and abiotic factors and thus affect the microbial community in soils from the aspect of plants fonseca et al 2007 reported an insignificant variation in crop yield when treated wastewater was used as irrigation water however non conventional water reuse may still pose potential risks to plants and or human health due to the accumulation of contaminants in crops especially with high demand for irrigation water for instance as presented in table 3 several heavy metals in non conventional water are toxic to certain plants and human health the treated non conventional water should meet the requirements and standards of water quality for irrigation water the emerging contaminants should also be critically considered for the reuse of domestic sewage as most emerging contaminants cannot be effectively removed by conventional wastewater treatments their existence would result in significant endocrine and hormone problems for human beings lauretta et al 2019 moreover pathogenic microorganisms are an important issue for reusing non conventional in irrigation ofori et al 2021 disinfection byproducts such as clo2 tombini decol et al 2019 also pose significant risks to human health it is thus recommended that the aop treatment technologies should be applied as aops have been shown to be useful to remove both emerging contaminants and pathogenic microorganisms for the environmental aspect foglia et al 2021 conducted a comparative environmental impact analysis and demonstrated that the reclaimed water reuse has more environmental benefits than the direct discharge of treated water this was mainly attributed to avoidance of fertilizer application and direct emissions to surface waterbodies i e nutrients and heavy metals garc√≠a et al 2020 also applied ecological methods to treat and reuse non conventional water in wetland they found that the presence of wetland systems can effectively remove emerging contaminants with lower environmental impacts in addition due to the high frequency and intensity of extreme climate events such as drought and flooding agriculture water resource management will become more difficult it is expected that applying non conventional water for irrigation could increase the resistance of agriculture to climate change the challenges of drought can be compensated by using other alternatives such as the process wastewater and domestic sewage as described in this study in the future the relevant risk assessment and sensitivity analysis for non conventional water reuse as irrigation under global climate change should be performed critically 5 priority research directions perspectives and prospects access to sustainable water services is indispensable for adaptation to climate change in the agricultural sector reclaiming non conventional wastewater for irrigation purposes instead of traditional wastewater treatment is particularly conducive to achieving a circular water economy systematic economic evaluation with sensitivity and reliability analyses should be performed critically considering various factors such as different economic and water prices amos et al 2018 and the payback period kuntz maykot and ghisi 2020 the overall costs of non conventional water reuse systems are mainly the capital collection and operation costs as a result to accelerate the progress of non conventional water reuse in agriculture three priority research directions should be the focus of attention 1 design for efficient collection 2 design for fit for purpose treatment and 3 deployment of energy efficient processes for recovering value added resources and providing a sustainable water service 5 1 utilities for efficient collection of non conventional water the collection and transport of wastewater generally involve a significant portion of energy consumption and thus operating costs of the entire reuse system long distance transportation of water and its related energy consumption conflicts with the essence of resource conservation and responsible consumption for example water head loss occurs during the transportation because of the friction and elbows so that pumps are necessary water loss also occurs during transportation because of evaporation and leakage in the case of rainwater collection runoff harvesting systems are usually deployed near the farmlands to reduce the evaporation loss several parameters such as technology option maintenance and tank size should be fully considered as they are the dominant factors for the overall costs of runoff harvesting systems abdulla 2020 campisano et al 2017 in addition as the concept of environmental sustainability evolves continuously decentralization of non conventional water treatment for various purposes including agriculture is a trend that has received a great deal of attention figure s2 decentralized systems can be built locally to minimize the resource and energy losses compared with conventional practices in line with decentralization a major concern should be the capital investment and land resources however a decentralized water supply system should have lower water transport costs the construction scale facility size and land requirement are comparatively less because the overall wastewater is diverted into several water supply systems 5 2 design for fit for purpose treatment most non conventional water raises concerns about various water quality parameters such as ec ss bod cod nutrients chloride sulfate and bacteria as a number of commercial technologies can be found for different targeted parameters this review summarized several available technologies for removing the key contaminants in fact non conventional water reuse systems should be fit for purpose to minimize the overall operation costs the concept of fit for purpose emphasizes that the quality of treated wastewater can be just suitable for its purpose connor et al 2017 for example the treated water quality does not have to meet drinking water standards if it is to be used for irrigation purposes which would be considered over treated without cost effectiveness this could be easier to achieve in decentralized water supply systems figure s3 unlike the centralized water supply system a local water supply system is able to meet the water quality requirement designated for given purposes and demands such as agricultural use the non conventional water reuse system should be established in farming areas that have the demand for irrigation water supply it is thus suggested that the concept of fit for purpose could be realized more fully through decentralization as the precise amount of energy and chemicals to purify non conventional water could be assessed based on the agricultural use standards 5 3 deployment of energy efficient processes for recovering value added resources non conventional water reuse systems require additional energy and or chemicals to purify wastewater to acceptable levels of water quality which may compensate the benefits of non conventional water reuse therefore it should be coupled with the concept of resource recovery such as organic substances inorganic compounds and nutrients to maximize the revenues from the circular water economy to achieve this goal development and deployment of integrated separation processes are an essential strategy in response to the water and energy nexus under global climate change a major consideration for water reuse technologies is energy efficiency i e from thermodynamic point of view and the impact of the concentrate brine on the discharge environment for instance for non conventional water containing a medium salinity e g 2 5 g l deployment of electrokinetic separation processes would be more energy efficient from the thermodynamic point of view compared to pressure driven or thermal driven approaches pan et al 2020 the concentrated stream from the separation processes could be utilized as a byproduct for further applications in other words in addition to the purified water used for irrigation the concentrated byproduct if reaches the product specification in the market could be sold in the market to obtain additional revenue innovative business models for non conventional water reuse are imperative to achieve a sustainable water service for instance takeuchi and tanaka 2020 indicated that a water reuse business could be economically viable if it utilizes existing water pipelines for purified water supply even though their case studies were for industrial or domestic purposes with this experience we believe that non conventional water reuse systems should be combined with existing water utilities nearby farm lands non conventional water reuse systems not only refer to technologies and infrastructures but also local policies regulations institutions and society that are relevant to the system these factors would have a marked impact on the feasibility of the business models for supporting non conventional water reuse 6 conclusions there is an increasing need for irrigation water because of increasing demand for food appropriate water allocation and water resource management should be developed to meet this requirement this paper first reviewed how people can reuse non conventional water as available irrigation water five types of non conventional water rainfall stormwater runoff cooling water hydraulic fracturing wastewater process wastewater from pulp paper and food industries and domestic sewage were reviewed the results indicate that most of them raise concerns about water quality such as ss bod cod salinity nutrients chloride sulfate bacteria and emerging contaminants as a number of commercial technologies could be found for ss and bod cod this paper summarized the available technologies for monitoring and controlling the key contaminants in wastewater in addition this study addressed potential risks to plants human health the environment and climate change for non conventional water reuse as irrigation water lastly three priority research directions were proposed to achieve better water allocation and water resource management important concepts such as efficient collection of non conventional water fit for purpose treatment and value added resource recovery should be considered for successfully converting non conventional water into available irrigation water declaration

16958,composite adsorbent ultrafiltration membranes for micropollutant removal are an interesting concept although water matrix compounds such as organic matter om may interfere with micropollutant adsorption to prevent this interference the adsorbents such as single walled carbon nanotubes swcnts can be deposited on the permeate side of an ultrafiltration membrane uf that can retain om in this study the shielding effect by different uf mwcos of such an swcnt uf composite was evaluated for nine different types of om all nine om types competed with 17Œ≤ estradiol e2 for adsorption to varying extents and tannic acid ta 1 7 kda reduced e2 adsorption by swcnt uf most drastically ta interference mechanisms included direct competition with hormones for adsorption sites and indirect competition via ta hormone interactions ta was not fully retained by the composite membrane with an mwco range of 3 100 kda resulting in ineffective shielding in contrast humic acid was mostly retained by the composite with low mwco of 3 10 kda and allowed high e2 adsorption this study demonstrates that tailoring composite membranes by carefully choosing uf mwco can prevent interference of om types in micropollutant adsorption by permeate side adsorbents graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords natural organic matter membrane adsorption interference size exclusion liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd physico chemical water treatment 1 introduction 1 1 steroid hormone removal with composite adsorbent ultrafiltration membranes adsorbent incorporation in high permeability micro ultrafiltration membranes mf uf is a promising concept to remove micropollutants mps from water ihsanullah 2019 lewis et al 2019 peter et al 2016 steroid hormones such as estrone e1 and 17Œ≤ estradiol e2 are among the target mps for removal because they are ubiquitous in the environment and can cause endocrine disruption at concentrations as low as 1 6 ng l caldwell et al 2012 removal of steroid hormones to below 1 ng l is a technical and economic challenge unmodified mf uf with relatively low energy consumption 0 015 0 3 kw h m3 mass√© et al 2011 cannot remove steroid hormones yoon et al 2004 because pore sizes of 2 1000 nm van der bruggen et al 2003 do not allow size exclusion of these sub nanometre molecules in contrast carbon based adsorbents such as powdered activated carbon pac multi and single walled carbon nanotubes mw swcnts and graphene have high adsorption capacity for steroid hormones jiang et al 2017 nguyen et al 2020 pan et al 2008 sophia and lima 2018 therefore the combination of these materials and mf uf can allow effective steroid hormone removal through an adsorption mechanism notably hollow carbon nanoadsorbents deposited in an uf support loading 40 g m2 adsorbed 2 0 4 1 ng cm2 of 100 ng l steroid hormones with a treated volume of 530 l m2 liao et al 2020 with a low swcnt loading 2 g m2 an swcnt uf composite adsorbed 12 8 ng cm2 of 100 ng l 17Œ≤ estradiol e2 with a treated volume of 2750 l m2 nguyen et al 2021 these results with simple water matrices are encouraging however in real water matrices compounds such as organic matter om can interfere with micropollutant adsorption 1 2 interactions of organic matter om with adsorbents and steroid hormones to evaluate the interference of om with steroid hormone adsorption it is important to first understand the interactions of om with both adsorbents and hormones in respective om adsorbent and om hormone binary systems carbon nanotubes cnts which are the evaluated adsorbents in this study can adsorb om strongly because of their high external surface areas upadhyayula et al 2009 key om cnt interactions are hydrogen h bonding œÄ œÄ stacking and hydrophobic interaction hyung and kim 2008 wang et al 2013 œÄ œÄ stacking is a short range 0 5 nm interaction between aromatic rings and is relevant in the adsorption of aromatic compounds tournus et al 2005 short range 0 5 nm h bonding depends on the numbers of h bond donors and acceptors neel et al 2017 whereas hydrophobic interaction over relatively longer distances of 10 nm israelachvili and pashley 1982 is influenced by the hydrophobicity of the adsorbate and cnt surface mw swcnts adsorb highly aromatic om such as ha and tannic acid ta at capacities of hundreds of mg g lin and xing 2008 wang et al 2013 wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 solution chemistry affects the conformation of both om and cnts and hence om cnt hydrophobic interaction conte and piccolo 1999 as a result om adsorption decreases with solution ph and increases with ionic strength engel and chefetz 2016 hyung and kim 2008 in contrast om size has no direct impact on om adsorption ajmani et al 2014 reported that mw swcnts adsorbed the medium size and aromatic om more strongly than both the high hmw and low molecular weight lmw ones with lower aromaticity likewise cnts adsorb the aromatic om fraction with sizes of 1 6 2 8 nm but not the non aromatic fraction with sizes 1 nm ateia et al 2017 shimizu et al 2018 similar to om cnt interactions om hormone interactions include œÄ œÄ stacking h bonding and hydrophobic interaction ma and yates 2018 in addition electrostatic interaction occurs between charged om and hormones for example e2 at ph 10 hence solution chemistry is critical to om hormone interactions neale et al 2009 at neutral ph strong om hormone interactions were observed with highly aromatic om such as ta and ha jin et al 2007 neale et al 2009 yamamoto et al 2003 in contrast non aromatic and hydrophilic om such as alginate alg interacts weakly with hormone neale et al 2009 yamamoto et al 2003 the strength of the om hormone interaction does not depend on om size om fractions between 3 7 and 450 nm in size display the same binding affinity for e2 lee et al 2011 however steroid hormone does not interact with the smaller om fractions 1 6 3 7 nm in size because they are non aromatic lee et al 2011 yeh et al 2014 in summary om aromaticity appears to influence both om cnt and om hormone interactions naturally this implies potential intervention of aromatic om types with hormone adsorption by cnts when the three components are present 1 3 interference of om with steroid hormone adsorption the influence of om in a ternary system containing cnts om and mps has been reported engel and chefetz 2019 the cnt pores i e the areas inside the nanotubes appear inaccessible so pore blockage is not a relevant interference mechanism shimizu et al 2018 two relevant interference mechanisms are 1 direct competition of om with hormones for cnt adsorption sites and 2 indirect competition when om bound to hormones reduces the affinity between this hormone and cnts these mechanisms illustrated in fig 1 are determined by the respective om cnt and om hormone interactions described above om interference can be affected by the vast difference in concentration between om mgc l and mp hormone ng l in real waters zhang et al 2010 and the contact residence time of the adsorbates at the cnt surface ajmani et al 2014 several investigations were done with elevated and unrealistic hormone concentrations for example sun and zhou 2014 reported strong om e2 interactions that inhibited e2 adsorption by mwcnts although the initial e2 concentrations 0 4 2 4 mg l were high likewise jiang et al 2017 reported low e2 adsorption by mw swcnts in the presence of om but the initial e2 concentrations were 0 05 2 5 mg l these concentrations are 2 4 orders of magnitude higher than those of e2 in wastewater effluents and surface waters luo et al 2014 pal et al 2010 in static adsorption with a more relevant e2 concentration of 100 ng l tagliavini et al 2017 observed a minor decreasing trend in e2 adsorbed mass by polymer based spherical activated carbon pbsac from 98 to 80 ng g with increasing ha concentration the minimal competition was attributed to the exclusion of ha molecules from the small pbsac pores that were important to hormone adsorption the limited accessibility of ha to pbsac pores also resulted in similar and low ha adsorption and interference in both static and dynamic adsorption tagliavini et al 2017 wolters et al 2019 however when investigating cnts with predominantly external surfaces ajmani et al 2014 observed higher om adsorption in static than in dynamic filtration experiments which highlights the importance of factors such as mass transfer and residence time 1 4 om interference control with uf mwco once the om interference mechanism is understood strategies to prevent such interference can be designed tailoring the uf mwco allows the retention of certain om fractions based on size and can prevent om interference with permeate side adsorbents uf mwco of 5 10 kda can remove humic substances which are the main constituent 40 60 of natural organic matter nom thurman 1985 via size exclusion aschermann et al 2016 kennedy et al 2005 lowe and hossain 2008 however other compounds with diverse properties can also contribute to nom biopolymer like om mw 20 kda can be retained with higher uf mwcos of 30 300 kda filloux et al 2012 hadidi et al 2015 whereas lmw compounds mw 350 da can pass through uf kennedy et al 2005 with the uf pbsac composite wolters et al 2019 established a decreasing trend in ha and tanzanian nom retention with uf mwco between 1 and 300 kda near complete removals of ha and nom were achieved with uf mwco 5 kda as these om types contain mostly humic substances but e2 removal was only affected minimally it appears that ha and nom caused only minor interference with steroid hormone adsorption by pbsac to evaluate the control with uf mwco om retention should be considered together with its interference potential concerning adsorbents that contain mainly external surface like cnts the interference of om can be important wherein control strategies can yield better results in previous work hormone adsorption by an swcnt uf composite was investigated in the absence of om nguyen et al 2021 the novelty of this research however lies in the investigation of how a broad range of om types interfere with steroid hormone removal by this composite membrane subsequently a control strategy which is varying the uf mwco between 3 and 100 kda is evaluated with the most interfering om types the specific research questions are i does om significantly interfere with steroid hormone adsorption by swcnt uf ii which om characteristics lead to the interference and iii can such interference be controlled by uf mwco 2 materials and methods 2 1 ultrafiltration membranes the chosen membranes are the asymmetric ultracel plh uf 3 100 kda merck millipore usa which contain a regenerated cellulose dense layer and polypropylene polyethylene support layer these membranes were chosen based on their low adsorption of both hormones nguyen et al 2021 wolters et al 2019 and om wolters et al 2019 the membrane thickness is 230 Œºm merck millipore 2020 main membrane characteristics are summarised in table 1 2 2 single walled carbon nanotubes different carbon based nanoparticles such as mw swcnts graphene and fullerene c60 had been considered and swcnts outperformed other candidates owing to their fast apparent adsorption kinetics and high capacity of 10 mg g for steroid hormones in batch experiments nguyen et al 2020 in filtration studies fast adsorption kinetics is required because the residence times are typically short in a membrane i e of several seconds or fractions of seconds kulcke et al 1999 in comparison with mwcnts swcnts have a higher external surface area peigney et al 2001 which facilitates adsorbate access pan and xing 2008 other groups reported that swcnts show better adsorption performance in membrane composites ellerie et al 2013 wang et al 2015 therefore swcnts were selected over mwcnts for this adsorptive filtration study the surface area of these swcnts measured from argon adsorption desorption is high at about 800 m2 g and the swcnt surface contains 98 carbon and 2 oxygen according to x ray photoelectron spectroscopy

as ta are rich in aromatic rings and can interact with cnts and hormones via œÄ œÄ stacking and h bonding chen et al 2008 lin and xing 2008 ma and yates 2018 in contrast non aromatic and hydrophilic om types such as alg or glu can only form h bonds the other om types have previously unknown properties their potential interaction mechanisms with cnts and hormones will be determined in this study 2

analyzer sievers m9 suez france this toc analyzer was not used for feed and permeate samples containing steroid hormones because ethanol in the hormone solutions could reach 14 mgc l and hence did not allow om concentration determination instead lc ocd was used to determine the om concentration because it gave a separate organic carbon signal for ethanol at 40 min that was distinguishable from most om signals an uv vis spectrometer lambda 25 perkin elmer usa was used to determine the absorbance of om in the wavelength range of 220 700 nm absorbance of nine om types at 20 mgc l as a function of

q water the om concentration in the feed and initial solutions was 10 mgc l which is within the doc range in surface waters aschermann et al 2016 martin mousset et al 1997 in each static adsorption experiment two solutions in separate 250 ml conical flasks were prepared flask a contained swcnts and flask b contained om and e2 nguyen et al 2020 in flask a 25 mg of swcnts weighed with the analytical balance was mixed with 50 ml of milli q water and sonicated for 1 hour in the ultrasonic bath then background electrolytes and milli q water were added to flask a to make up 125 ml of 1 mm nahco3 and 10 mm nacl in flask b a 125 ml mixture of 200 ng l e2 20 mgc l om 1 mm nahco3 and 10 mm nacl was prepared from the respective stock solutions the ph of the feed and initial solutions was adjusted to 8 1 0 2 to ensure no bias emerging from incomplete om hormone interactions the mixtures of om and hormones in both static adsorption flask b and filtration were prepared around 30 min before the respective experiments 2 7 static adsorption static adsorption was performed to investigate om interference in a ternary mixture of om e2 and swcnts as the static adsorption started the om and hormone mixture flask b in section 2 6 was transferred to the swcnt solution flask a in section 2 6 in an incubator shaker innova 43r new brunswick scientific usa to make up 250 ml of 0 1 g l swcnts 100 ng l hormone and 10 mgc l om the incubator shaker operated at a shaking speed of 260 rpm and a temperature of 20 1 c at time intervals between 5 min and 26 h 2 5 ml aliquots were extracted with a plastic syringe norm ject 10 ml hsw germany and immediately filtered with the 100 kda uf ultracel plhhk in a stainless steel membrane holder 13 mm diameter merck millipore to avoid further swcnt hormone interaction each separate membrane coupon was used for filtering the extracted solutions and recycled up to six times 2 8 swcnt uf composite preparation to incorporate swcnts in the uf support two procedures were followed as illustrated in figure s1 si for the 10 100 kda uf swcnt incorporation was done via vacuum filtration as described previously nguyen et al 2021 a 70 mm membrane coupon was placed upside down on a stainless steel support inside a glass funnel diameter 73 mm duran germany then 84 ml of swcnt suspension which corresponds to the 2 g m2 loading was poured into the funnel and a vacuum pump model fb70155 fisher scientific uk assisted swcnt deposition with a maximum pressure of 2 3 bar for the 3 5 kda uf an alternative process was used to reduce the swcnt uf preparation time the 70 mm membrane coupon was placed upside down inside a stainless steel cell with a volume capacity of 900 ml imbrogno and sch√§fer 2019 subsequently 84 ml of swcnt suspension was added to the cell the cell was then sealed and the suspension was filtered with a synthetic air pressure of 4 bar in both procedures swcnt incorporation was complete once all suspension was filtered and each swcnt loaded membrane was cut into up to four 25 mm circular membrane coupons for each experiment a 25 mm swcnt loaded uf coupon 4 9 cm2 was placed on a 25 mm pristine uf membrane of the same mwco with the dense layer of both membranes facing upwards and mounted in the membrane cell the stock swcnt suspension was kept in the fridge at 4 c and sonicated for 1 h before each subsequent incorporation 2 9 filtration system and filtration protocol the filtration system fig 2 with an effective membrane area of 2 cm2 1 2 cm determined by a feed spacer was operated in cross flow mode which reassembles the spiral wound modules imbrogno and sch√§fer 2019 and causes less fouling by hmw om compared with the dead end mode see figure s4 si this system is similar to the one described in previous work nguyen et al 2021 it must be noted that the membrane coupon with an area of 4 9 cm2 was inserted in the system while only 2 cm2 was exposed to the feed solution however there is no flow restriction inside the membrane so the full membrane area of 4 9 cm2 was accessible to some extent the filtration protocol is as described in table s1 si each experiment contains a thirty minute compaction followed by a fifteen minute pure water flux test main filtration with the om hormone solution and another fifteen minute pure water flux test four types of experiments were performed a om type b steroid hormone type c pressure flux and d membrane mwco except in experiments with pressure variation the applied pressure was fixed at 1 bar for 10 100 kda and 4 bar for 3 5 kda membranes a fixed feed flow rate of 30 ml min was set with the hplc pump in all experiments the crossflow rate and hence recovery were not controlled and could depend on the membrane permeability applied pressure and om size the temperature was not controlled and varied around 24 2 c as shown in section 8 of the si error from this variation was included in cumulative error analysis in section 3 si filtration was done until 150 ml 750 l m2 and 30 ml 150 l m2 of permeate were obtained for 30 100 kda and 3 10 kda membranes respectively 2 10 data analyses the calculations in this work are described in table 3 error analysis is given in section 3 si adsorption performance is evaluated through the determination of removal and adsorbed mass parameters with eq 3 and eq 4 respectively adsorbed masses of steroid hormones and mass loss of om are reported in section 10 si to estimate the membrane porosity with the hagen poiseuille law kirby 2010 the membrane layer is assumed to consist of multiple cylindrical pores with the same dimension with radius r p and length Œ¥ m this assumption is incorrect for the asymmetric membranes hence the application of the hagen poiseuille law results in an apparent porosity that would be valid for membranes of the same mwco and with cylindrical pores the pressure difference between the two ends is Œ¥ p water velocity in one of these cylindrical pores is determined from the hagen poiseuille law and because the pure water flux is equal to porosity multiplied by water velocity the porosity can also be expressed as given in eq 6 mochizuki and zydney 1993 3 results and discussion previous studies focus on steroid hormone removal by swcnts in static adsorption and by swcnt uf composite in filtration experiments nguyen et al 2021 nguyen et al 2020 in this study the influence of nine om types in both types of experiments was first examined followed by the investigation of om characteristics that could cause interference finally hormone removal by swcnt uf under varying conditions hormone type residence time and uf mwco was evaluated with the most interfering om type s 3 1 impact of om types in static adsorption om can influence both the e2 adsorption efficiency and kinetics of swcnts to quantify such influences static adsorption was performed with a ternary mixture of swcnt e2 and om the e2 adsorbed mass at equilibrium and k e 2 are reported in fig 3 e2 adsorbed mass as a function of time is given in figure s5 si the temperature in the incubator shaker was controlled at 20 1 c as shown in fig 3 without om e2 adsorbed mass at equilibrium was 24 5 ng when om was introduced e2 adsorbed mass decreased to 18 7 21 8 ng which indicates interference by om e2 adsorbed mass variation was not significant between the nine different om types hence a relationship between om characteristics and om interference could not be determined this observation contradicts those in other studies where strong interactions of om with both cnts and small organic molecules were linked with high om aromaticity chen et al 2007 engel and chefetz 2015 ma and yates 2018 wang et al 2009 however when evaluating a larger sample set engel and chefetz 2019 found no correlation between om aromaticity and om adsorption by cnts specifically the concentration difference between e2 and om of five orders of magnitude in this work could enhance the direct competition of om with e2 for the adsorption sites and mask the impact of om characteristics zhang et al 2010 e2 adsorption rate constant k e 2 decreased from 57 20 h 1 in the control experiment without om to around 7 23 h 1 with ta tea glu and aus in contrast k e 2 with alg tann and wf did not vary significantly from the control value e2 adsorption kinetics could be related to om size since small om compounds might diffuse into more surface area of swcnts that would not be reached by larger om compounds pan and xing 2008 hence small om could compete with e2 for the less accessible swcnt adsorption sites which potentially limited the speed of hormone adsorption when swcnts in a composite membrane were operated with short residence times of several seconds for example 0 3 3 3 s in this work table s2 si the adsorption kinetics can determine e2 adsorption and removal to evaluate the adsorption performance in short residence times the hormone breakthrough curves with swcnt uf were examined 3 2 impact of om types on e2 breakthrough with swcnt uf breakthrough curves indicate the evolution of permeate hormone concentration c p with permeate volume or time and allow qualitative evaluation of om interference in a dynamic membrane adsorption process the breakthrough experiment was performed with swcnt uf 100 kda which would not retain om except some hmw fractions and ensured little or no om shielding fig 4 shows the breakthrough curves up to 150 ml of permeate volume experimental parameters such as pressure permeate mass conductivity and temperature are given in figure s8 si values of feed retentate and permeate concentrations are given in table s4 si as shown in fig 4 the adsorption saturation where c p would be equal to the feed or retentate concentration was not reached with or without om the impact of varying om types on c p was significant ha tea fp and ta increased c p in comparison with the control experiment without om while aus alg glu tann and wf had only minor influence on c p the strongest interference was found for ta where c p at a permeate volume of 150 ml was 87 ng l which is 30 higher than that of the control 59 ng l other studies showed that ta contained a high density of aromatic rings and could induce strong œÄ œÄ interactions with both swcnts lin and xing 2008 and e2 yamamoto et al 2003 hence this om type could influence e2 adsorption by swcnt uf via both direct and indirect competition mechanisms while the breakthrough curves provide a good impression of how om interfered with e2 removal the adsorbed mass of e2 determined from the mass balance allows a more quantitative analysis of such interference 3 3 impact of om types on e2 removal by swcnt uf the performance of swcnt uf with different om types was evaluated from e2 removal e2 adsorbed mass and om removal at a permeate volume of 150 ml as shown in fig 5 the performance in control conditions i e without om is indicated by the dashed line om concentrations except for ta were determined based on the sum of organic carbon matter in the humic substances building block and lmw fractions in lc ocd and reported in table s8 ta tann tea and wf were partly adsorbed by the instrument capillaries and sec column without the influence of the feed water matrix the estimated percentages of adsorbed om to lc ocd were 50 90 table s3 si with the influence of ethanol and background electrolytes in the feed om adsorption to lc ocd appeared less significant table s8 although the reported removals of tann tea and wf are not reliable ta is an important om type because it induced the strongest interference and to solve this analytical problem the concentration was determined accurately with uv vis spectroscopy at an absorbance wavelength of 213 nm the estimated om mass loss that was determinable with lc ocd is given in figure s13 as shown in fig 5 c om types retained by the 100 kda uf include alg 95 c p approached the detection limit of 0 1 mgc l and wf 45 which could be linked to high mw interference evaluation with these om types is affected by the partial om retention of the uf from fig 5 a and b the remaining seven om types appeared to permeate completely through swcnt uf 100 kda and influenced e2 removal and adsorbed mass to specific extents in the presence of ta ha and tea e2 adsorbed mass decreased to 0 8 1 7 ng cm2 from 3 1 ng cm2 in the control experiment without om the adsorbed mass of ta was significant figure s13 which could imply direct competition of ta with e2 for adsorption sites in contrast aus and fp had a moderate negative influence on e2 adsorbed mass 2 5 ng cm2 e2 adsorption by glu and tann were similar to that of the control om interference in dynamic membrane adsorption fig 5 differs from that in static adsorption fig 3 probably because interference may have been determined by parameters that are specific for each type of experiment such as mass transfer or residence time in static adsorption the swcnt surface accessibility was important nguyen et al 2020 hence varying the om type has a stronger influence on e2 adsorption kinetics than e2 adsorbed mass at equilibrium however in dynamic membrane adsorption with short residence times e2 adsorption appeared to happen only at the most accessible surface of swcnts nguyen et al 2021 here the affinity of om for swcnts and or e2 could be a critical factor the characteristics size and aromaticity of these nine om types were subsequently evaluated to explain their interference capability 3 4 characteristics of om that affect interference fractionation in terms of composition and size of the nine om types at 5 mgc l was determined to evaluate the relationship between the om fractions and om interference with e2 adsorption lc ocd analysis was performed to quantify organic carbon in biopolymer 20 kda humic substance around 1 kda building block 300 500 da and lmw 350 da fractions villacorte et al 2010 raw organic carbon signal is plotted against elution time as shown in fig 6 concentrations of individual fractions are shown in table s3 as shown in fig 6 c f and i the peak areas corresponding to the eluted phenol rich compounds tea tann and ta appear to be relatively small because parts of these om types were adsorbed by lc ocd capillaries and sec column and hence cannot be detected om losses were estimated in table s3 si to be 50 80 and 90 for tea tann and ta respectively non ideal fractionation of hydrophobic components is the major cause of om loss in the sec column mant et al 1987 detailed characterisation of lost om is not possible when only the eluted om is considered tann gives a peak corresponding to hmw biopolymer like compounds 20 kda while ta and tea contains mainly building blocks and lmw compounds small ta and tea compounds showed the strongest interference with e2 adsorption in contrast tann with higher mw did not intervene significantly as shown in fig 6 a and b ha shows strong resemblance to nom for example aus because both om types contain mainly fractions in the humic substance 1 kda region thurman 1985 the mw of humic substance fraction of aus is lower than that of ha according to lc ocd characterisation table s3 but both om types intervened similarly with e2 adsorption by swcnt uf fig 5 from fig 6 g and h substantial size difference is observed for fp and wf which are both products of biodegradation fp from the industrial fermentation process shows two building block and lmw fractions of similar maximum intensities whereas the home made wf shows a double peak indicating a mix of biopolymers and humic substances the size difference between wf and fp minimally affected e2 adsorbed mass in the filtration with swcnt uf fig 5 in the dynamic membrane adsorption process om size appeared not to be the deciding factor in om interference however in static adsorption the kinetic rate constant k e 2 was lower for small om types such as aus tea ta and glu fig 3 the only exception was small fp where k e 2 was high small om diffusing into the less accessible surface of swcnts could compete with e2 and hence reduce the kinetics of e2 mp adsorption pan and xing 2008 in the next step om aromaticity was determined to investigate whether this characteristic was linked to om interference the ratio between the uv absorbance at 254 nm and the toc concentration eq 8 referred to as the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva254 is commonly used to characterise aromaticity matilainen et al 2011 weishaar et al 2003 the higher suva254 the higher the content of aromatic rings suva254 of the nine om types measured with the uv vis spectrometer and toc analyzer are given in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 ha has a relatively high suva254 of 7 7 l mg m which characterised highly aromatic and hydrophobic compounds edzwald 1993 in contrast ta tann tea wf and aus have relatively lower suva254 of 2 4 l mg m so these om types are less aromatic than ha certain om types with high or moderate aromaticity such as ta tea ha and aus induced the strongest interference with e2 adsorption by swcnt uf fig 5 as such œÄ œÄ stacking can be an important interaction between om and swcnt or e2 in contrast fp alg and glu have near zero suva254 these om types have little impact on e2 adsorbed mass by swcnt uf which implies that h bonding may not be responsible for interference within short residence times in summary aromatic rings in om have the greatest direct impact on the interference with dynamic e2 adsorption by swcnt uf om size is not directly related to interference although aromatic om appeared to affect e2 adsorption strongly if the om was small such as in the cases of tea and ta for example next the impact of other filtration variables hormone type residence time and uf mwco is evaluated in the presence of ta which induced the strongest interference 3 5 impact of hormone types on om ta interference each steroid hormone type has distinct characteristics nguyen et al 2020 and can induce specific interactions with adsorbents and om to evaluate the adsorption of other hormone types e1 t and p by swcnt uf filtration experiments were performed with and without ta hormone removal hormone adsorbed mass and ta removal at 150 ml of permeate volume with swcnt uf 100 kda are shown in fig 8 ta was determined from uv absorbance at 213 nm ta adsorbed mass is given in figure s14 and experimental parameters such as pressure permeate mass conductivities and temperature are shown in figure s9 si from fig 8 b without om the adsorbed mass of p was highest 5 5 ng cm2 followed by those of e2 and t around 3 ng cm2 the adsorbed mass of e1 was the lowest 2 3 ng cm2 similar trend in adsorbed mass was reported with swcnt uf 10 kda in previous work where it was indicated that hormone adsorption was driven by the interactions at the most accessible swcnt surface nguyen et al 2021 as shown in fig 8 a ta interfered with the adsorption of all four hormone types as r h reduced drastically to below 10 for e1 e2 and t and slightly from 80 to 70 for p according to fig 8 c the difference in ta removal was not significant within error ta adsorbed mass is given in figure s14 indicating that more ta was adsorbed in the presence of p than e1 e2 and t ta appeared to interact strongly with p and was adsorbed by swcnts along with this hormone type although data may not be reliable at low ta retention neale et al 2009 observed stronger interactions of ta with p and e1 than with e2 and t and suggested that p and e1 had hydrogen accepting ketone groups that enhanced their interactions with ta interference due to ta e1 interactions cannot be assumed in this work because the adsorption of both e1 and ta by swcnt uf was low through the specific case of p it was hypothesised that the ta hormone interactions were relevant to hormone adsorption by swcnt uf as such ta competed indirectly with steroid hormones for adsorption sites 3 6 impact of flux residence time on om interference since steroid hormone adsorption by swcnt uf is a kinetic process the residence time t r of the hormones determines the adsorption efficiency by adjusting the pressure the flux could be varied and hence t r to determine whether e2 adsorption by swcnt uf 10 kda was limited by t r from 6 6 to 0 8 s in the presence of ta e2 filtration experiment was performed at different pressures from 0 5 to 4 bar fig 9 shows e2 removal e2 adsorbed mass and ta removal at 30 ml of permeate volume as functions of flux and t r ta was determined from uv absorbance at 213 nm complementary ta mass loss is given in figure s15 si experimental parameters such as pressure permeate mass conductivities and temperature are given in figure s10 si according to fig 9 a and b e2 removal and adsorbed mass in all ta experiments were independent of flux and residence time with values around 20 and 0 5 ng cm2 respectively similar e2 adsorption observations were reported in previous work without om nguyen et al 2021 where the swcnt surface was in excess and e2 adsorption at the most accessible sites was fast and not controlled by residence time between 0 08 and 7 1 s similarly although ta negatively affected e2 removal by swcnt uf ta did not appear to control the kinetic process of e2 adsorption at the most accessible swcnt surface therefore it was hypothesised that ta reduced the affinity of e2 for swcnts via ta e2 interactions i e indirect competition might occur the ta e2 interactions were favoured by the relatively long contact time of 30 min between the two species prior to the filtration experiment from fig 9 c the swcnt uf 10 kda partially removed ta 1 7 kda and ta removal appeared to increase with flux from around 37 at 16 l m2 h to 61 at 103 l m2 h however this variation in ta removal did not affect e2 adsorption by the permeate side swcnts ta removal could be attributed to either adsorption or retention adsorbed mass of ta did not vary significantly with flux at around 0 1 mgc cm2 figure s15 therefore it was implied that the trend in ta removal was due to ta retention probably because the flux of ta was lower than that of water and this flux difference increased with pressure in summary e2 removal with swcnt uf was low and independent of residence time 0 8 6 6 s in the presence of ta this implies a disadvantage to the filtration process because the intervention of this om type would not be alleviated by increasing the flow rate or pressure 3 7 impact of uf mwco on om interference and the shielding of uf certain fractions of the om can be removed by the uf mwco aoustin et al 2001 taniguchi et al 2003 therefore the interference from these fractions may be controlled in this section the mwco of swcnt uf was varied from 3 to 100 kda ha mw 4 7 30 4 kda see table 2 was selected in addition to ta 1 7 kda because shielding by uf might be more effective against the higher mw om type e2 removal e2 adsorbed mass and ta ha removal as a function of uf mwco are given in fig 10 the total permeate volume was 30 ml for 1 10 kda membranes and 150 ml for 30 100 kda membranes ta concentration was determined from uv absorbance at 213 nm whereas ha concentration was determined from the sum of humic substance building block and lmw concentrations in lc ocd with an uncertainty of 13 due to ha adsorption in the sec column table s3 si mass loss of ta ha is given in figure s6 experimental parameters such as pressure permeate mass conductivities and temperature are given in figures s11 and s12 si from fig 10 c ta removal decreased with mwco but even the lowest mwco of 3 kda could only retain about 80 of ta therefore the shielding of uf against ta was not efficient and as shown in fig 10 a ta permeation decreased r e 2 to 48 from 82 in the control experiment without om with swcnt uf 3 kda fig 10 c also shows that unlike ta ha was almost completely retained 95 99 removal by swcnt uf 3 10 kda since minimal ha concentration was found in the permeate of these membranes near complete ha retention by the same uf mwcos was also reported in the literature aoustin et al 2001 lowe and hossain 2008 wolters et al 2019 with efficient ha shielding by tight uf 3 10 kda as shown in fig 10 a and b e2 removal and adsorbed mass were similar between the ha and control no om experiments an increase in e2 removal due to the interactions between retained ha ta and e2 was not observed fig 10 a in dead end filtration experiments jermann et al 2009 reported a slight increase in e2 removal by 100 kda uf due to 10 mgc l ha neale and sch√§fer 2012 determined that 18 e2 was partitioned to ha and e2 ha interactions increased e2 removal by 1 100 kda uf by 2 3 times in contrast e2 removal enhancement due to ta ha was not observed with swcnt uf in this work probably because the amount of permeating e2 did not affect e2 adsorption this is attributed to the fact that the swcnt adsorption sites were in excess because the main fractions of nom are humic substances and most of these are humic acids in natural water the low uf mwco potentially shields the interference of a relatively wide range of om in real waters however in the operation of such low mwco membranes higher operating pressures and costs may be required to achieve the same productivity small and hydrophobic compounds in water similar to ta cannot be controlled by the uf mwco and may be detrimental to the adsorption performance of the composite membrane if these compounds occur at significant concentrations 4 conclusions in this work the interference of nine om types with different characteristics on hormone removal by an adsorptive swcnt uf membrane was investigated all om types interfered with e2 removal by swcnt uf in dynamic membrane experiments to varying extents aromatic om types especially those with low mw such as ta impacted e2 removal most drastically both e2 and ta were adsorbed by swcnt uf which could imply that ta competed directly with e2 for adsorption sites ta also strongly reduced e1 and t adsorption but only slightly affected p adsorption in addition reducing the residence time from 6 6 to 0 8 s did not affect hormone removal in the presence of ta it was then hypothesised that ta reduced the affinity of e2 for swcnts ta shielding 1 7 kda was not effective with uf mwco as low as 3 kda however humic acids 4 7 30 4 kda were well retained 95 99 by the mwco range of 3 10 kda and in consequence a high e2 removal of 80 was achieved similar to the control experiment without om this indicates successful control of interference while the adsorbents still need optimisation to achieve the european drinking water target of 1 ng l for e2 european parliament 2018 the enhanced adsorption performance due to om shielding is important swcnt uf can promise good performance with real waters where the humic like compounds that constitute the majority of nom are removed however small and aromatic om species in

16958,composite adsorbent ultrafiltration membranes for micropollutant removal are an interesting concept although water matrix compounds such as organic matter om may interfere with micropollutant adsorption to prevent this interference the adsorbents such as single walled carbon nanotubes swcnts can be deposited on the permeate side of an ultrafiltration membrane uf that can retain om in this study the shielding effect by different uf mwcos of such an swcnt uf composite was evaluated for nine different types of om all nine om types competed with 17Œ≤ estradiol e2 for adsorption to varying extents and tannic acid ta 1 7 kda reduced e2 adsorption by swcnt uf most drastically ta interference mechanisms included direct competition with hormones for adsorption sites and indirect competition via ta hormone interactions ta was not fully retained by the composite membrane with an mwco range of 3 100 kda resulting in ineffective shielding in contrast humic acid was mostly retained by the composite with low mwco of 3 10 kda and allowed high e2 adsorption this study demonstrates that tailoring composite membranes by carefully choosing uf mwco can prevent interference of om types in micropollutant adsorption by permeate side adsorbents graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords natural organic matter membrane adsorption interference size exclusion liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd physico chemical water treatment 1 introduction 1 1 steroid hormone removal with composite adsorbent ultrafiltration membranes adsorbent incorporation in high permeability micro ultrafiltration membranes mf uf is a promising concept to remove micropollutants mps from water ihsanullah 2019 lewis et al 2019 peter et al 2016 steroid hormones such as estrone e1 and 17Œ≤ estradiol e2 are among the target mps for removal because they are ubiquitous in the environment and can cause endocrine disruption at concentrations as low as 1 6 ng l caldwell et al 2012 removal of steroid hormones to below 1 ng l is a technical and economic challenge unmodified mf uf with relatively low energy consumption 0 015 0 3 kw h m3 mass√© et al 2011 cannot remove steroid hormones yoon et al 2004 because pore sizes of 2 1000 nm van der bruggen et al 2003 do not allow size exclusion of these sub nanometre molecules in contrast carbon based adsorbents such as powdered activated carbon pac multi and single walled carbon nanotubes mw swcnts and graphene have high adsorption capacity for steroid hormones jiang et al 2017 nguyen et al 2020 pan et al 2008 sophia and lima 2018 therefore the combination of these materials and mf uf can allow effective steroid hormone removal through an adsorption mechanism notably hollow carbon nanoadsorbents deposited in an uf support loading 40 g m2 adsorbed 2 0 4 1 ng cm2 of 100 ng l steroid hormones with a treated volume of 530 l m2 liao et al 2020 with a low swcnt loading 2 g m2 an swcnt uf composite adsorbed 12 8 ng cm2 of 100 ng l 17Œ≤ estradiol e2 with a treated volume of 2750 l m2 nguyen et al 2021 these results with simple water matrices are encouraging however in real water matrices compounds such as organic matter om can interfere with micropollutant adsorption 1 2 interactions of organic matter om with adsorbents and steroid hormones to evaluate the interference of om with steroid hormone adsorption it is important to first understand the interactions of om with both adsorbents and hormones in respective om adsorbent and om hormone binary systems carbon nanotubes cnts which are the evaluated adsorbents in this study can adsorb om strongly because of their high external surface areas upadhyayula et al 2009 key om cnt interactions are hydrogen h bonding œÄ œÄ stacking and hydrophobic interaction hyung and kim 2008 wang et al 2013 œÄ œÄ stacking is a short range 0 5 nm interaction between aromatic rings and is relevant in the adsorption of aromatic compounds tournus et al 2005 short range 0 5 nm h bonding depends on the numbers of h bond donors and acceptors neel et al 2017 whereas hydrophobic interaction over relatively longer distances of 10 nm israelachvili and pashley 1982 is influenced by the hydrophobicity of the adsorbate and cnt surface mw swcnts adsorb highly aromatic om such as ha and tannic acid ta at capacities of hundreds of mg g lin and xing 2008 wang et al 2013 wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 solution chemistry affects the conformation of both om and cnts and hence om cnt hydrophobic interaction conte and piccolo 1999 as a result om adsorption decreases with solution ph and increases with ionic strength engel and chefetz 2016 hyung and kim 2008 in contrast om size has no direct impact on om adsorption ajmani et al 2014 reported that mw swcnts adsorbed the medium size and aromatic om more strongly than both the high hmw and low molecular weight lmw ones with lower aromaticity likewise cnts adsorb the aromatic om fraction with sizes of 1 6 2 8 nm but not the non aromatic fraction with sizes 1 nm ateia et al 2017 shimizu et al 2018 similar to om cnt interactions om hormone interactions include œÄ œÄ stacking h bonding and hydrophobic interaction ma and yates 2018 in addition electrostatic interaction occurs between charged om and hormones for example e2 at ph 10 hence solution chemistry is critical to om hormone interactions neale et al 2009 at neutral ph strong om hormone interactions were observed with highly aromatic om such as ta and ha jin et al 2007 neale et al 2009 yamamoto et al 2003 in contrast non aromatic and hydrophilic om such as alginate alg interacts weakly with hormone neale et al 2009 yamamoto et al 2003 the strength of the om hormone interaction does not depend on om size om fractions between 3 7 and 450 nm in size display the same binding affinity for e2 lee et al 2011 however steroid hormone does not interact with the smaller om fractions 1 6 3 7 nm in size because they are non aromatic lee et al 2011 yeh et al 2014 in summary om aromaticity appears to influence both om cnt and om hormone interactions naturally this implies potential intervention of aromatic om types with hormone adsorption by cnts when the three components are present 1 3 interference of om with steroid hormone adsorption the influence of om in a ternary system containing cnts om and mps has been reported engel and chefetz 2019 the cnt pores i e the areas inside the nanotubes appear inaccessible so pore blockage is not a relevant interference mechanism shimizu et al 2018 two relevant interference mechanisms are 1 direct competition of om with hormones for cnt adsorption sites and 2 indirect competition when om bound to hormones reduces the affinity between this hormone and cnts these mechanisms illustrated in fig 1 are determined by the respective om cnt and om hormone interactions described above om interference can be affected by the vast difference in concentration between om mgc l and mp hormone ng l in real waters zhang et al 2010 and the contact residence time of the adsorbates at the cnt surface ajmani et al 2014 several investigations were done with elevated and unrealistic hormone concentrations for example sun and zhou 2014 reported strong om e2 interactions that inhibited e2 adsorption by mwcnts although the initial e2 concentrations 0 4 2 4 mg l were high likewise jiang et al 2017 reported low e2 adsorption by mw swcnts in the presence of om but the initial e2 concentrations were 0 05 2 5 mg l these concentrations are 2 4 orders of magnitude higher than those of e2 in wastewater effluents and surface waters luo et al 2014 pal et al 2010 in static adsorption with a more relevant e2 concentration of 100 ng l tagliavini et al 2017 observed a minor decreasing trend in e2 adsorbed mass by polymer based spherical activated carbon pbsac from 98 to 80 ng g with increasing ha concentration the minimal competition was attributed to the exclusion of ha molecules from the small pbsac pores that were important to hormone adsorption the limited accessibility of ha to pbsac pores also resulted in similar and low ha adsorption and interference in both static and dynamic adsorption tagliavini et al 2017 wolters et al 2019 however when investigating cnts with predominantly external surfaces ajmani et al 2014 observed higher om adsorption in static than in dynamic filtration experiments which highlights the importance of factors such as mass transfer and residence time 1 4 om interference control with uf mwco once the om interference mechanism is understood strategies to prevent such interference can be designed tailoring the uf mwco allows the retention of certain om fractions based on size and can prevent om interference with permeate side adsorbents uf mwco of 5 10 kda can remove humic substances which are the main constituent 40 60 of natural organic matter nom thurman 1985 via size exclusion aschermann et al 2016 kennedy et al 2005 lowe and hossain 2008 however other compounds with diverse properties can also contribute to nom biopolymer like om mw 20 kda can be retained with higher uf mwcos of 30 300 kda filloux et al 2012 hadidi et al 2015 whereas lmw compounds mw 350 da can pass through uf kennedy et al 2005 with the uf pbsac composite wolters et al 2019 established a decreasing trend in ha and tanzanian nom retention with uf mwco between 1 and 300 kda near complete removals of ha and nom were achieved with uf mwco 5 kda as these om types contain mostly humic substances but e2 removal was only affected minimally it appears that ha and nom caused only minor interference with steroid hormone adsorption by pbsac to evaluate the control with uf mwco om retention should be considered together with its interference potential concerning adsorbents that contain mainly external surface like cnts the interference of om can be important wherein control strategies can yield better results in previous work hormone adsorption by an swcnt uf composite was investigated in the absence of om nguyen et al 2021 the novelty of this research however lies in the investigation of how a broad range of om types interfere with steroid hormone removal by this composite membrane subsequently a control strategy which is varying the uf mwco between 3 and 100 kda is evaluated with the most interfering om types the specific research questions are i does om significantly interfere with steroid hormone adsorption by swcnt uf ii which om characteristics lead to the interference and iii can such interference be controlled by uf mwco 2 materials and methods 2 1 ultrafiltration membranes the chosen membranes are the asymmetric ultracel plh uf 3 100 kda merck millipore usa which contain a regenerated cellulose dense layer and polypropylene polyethylene support layer these membranes were chosen based on their low adsorption of both hormones nguyen et al 2021 wolters et al 2019 and om wolters et al 2019 the membrane thickness is 230 Œºm merck millipore 2020 main membrane characteristics are summarised in table 1 2 2 single walled carbon nanotubes different carbon based nanoparticles such as mw swcnts graphene and fullerene c60 had been considered and swcnts outperformed other candidates owing to their fast apparent adsorption kinetics and high capacity of 10 mg g for steroid hormones in batch experiments nguyen et al 2020 in filtration studies fast adsorption kinetics is required because the residence times are typically short in a membrane i e of several seconds or fractions of seconds kulcke et al 1999 in comparison with mwcnts swcnts have a higher external surface area peigney et al 2001 which facilitates adsorbate access pan and xing 2008 other groups reported that swcnts show better adsorption performance in membrane composites ellerie et al 2013 wang et al 2015 therefore swcnts were selected over mwcnts for this adsorptive filtration study the surface area of these swcnts measured from argon adsorption desorption is high at about 800 m2 g and the swcnt surface contains 98 carbon and 2 oxygen according to x ray photoelectron spectroscopy nguyen et al 2020 2 3 steroid hormones the steroid hormones in this study are tritium labelled 2 4 6 7 3h estrone e1 batch 2526125 2 4 6 7 3h 17Œ≤ estradiol e2 batch 2656306 1 2 6 7 3h progesterone p

prepared by diluting the supplied solutions by 300 times in milli q water reference a merck millipore and stored in a fridge at 4 c for up to one month 2 4 organic matter om nine om types of varying size origin aromaticity and hydrophobicity were selected to cover a wide range of om characteristics their characteristics are as shown in table 2 ha technical grade 80 purity sigma aldrich germany

product from three rounds of fermentation and purification of fruits and vegetables regulat 2020 wf is the raw liquid extracted from a stacked bin worm farm fed with food waste ha and phenolic om such as ta are rich in aromatic rings and can interact with cnts and hormones via œÄ œÄ stacking and h bonding chen et al 2008 lin and xing 2008 ma and yates 2018 in contrast non aromatic and hydrophilic om types such as alg or glu can only form h bonds the other om types have previously unknown properties their potential interaction mechanisms with cnts and hormones will be determined in this study 2 5 analytical methods liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd model 9 doc labor germany separated om into quantifiable fractions via size exclusion chromatography sec the previous lc ocd model model 8 is as described by huber et al 2011 the model 9 used in this study has higher sensitivity and shorter measurement time doc labor 2020 main om fractions are biopolymers 20 kda humic

software from doc labor huber et al 2011 software outputs included om concentration related to each fraction total organic carbon toc contents of the om stock solutions were measured with a toc analyzer sievers m9 suez france this toc analyzer was not used for feed and permeate samples containing steroid hormones because ethanol in the hormone solutions could reach 14 mgc l and hence did not allow om concentration determination instead lc ocd was used to determine the om concentration because it gave a separate organic carbon signal for ethanol at 40 min that was distinguishable from most om signals an uv vis spectrometer lambda 25 perkin elmer usa was used to determine the absorbance of om in the wavelength range of 220 700 nm absorbance of nine om types at 20 mgc l as a function of wavelength is shown in figure s6 supporting information si a liquid scintillation counter lsc 2550 tr ab packard usa was used to determine the concentrations of radiolabeled hormones birks 1975 the detection limit was about 0 1 ng l tagliavini et al 2017 a volume of 1 ml of hormone containing sample was mixed with 1 ml of scintillation liquid ultima gold llt perkinelmer and analyses three times hormone concentration was calculated from activity based on several calibration solutions 0 2 1 0 10 50 and 100 ng l lsc signal quenching was determined from the activities corresponding to 10 ng l and 100 ng l e2 in various om concentrations 1 5 10 20 50 and 100 mgc l figure s2 si the feed solution ph was determined with a ph meter inolab ph720 wtw germany 2 6 solution preparation for swcnt deposition in uf membrane a 0 1 g l stock swcnt suspension was prepared by mixing 100 mg of swcnts with 1 l of milli q water and 1 ml of triton x100 surfactant sigma aldrich usa the mixture was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath wg300 endo technik wg germany for 1 hour to obtain a near homogeneous state nguyen et al 2021 a background electrolyte stock solution of 5 mm nahco3 dissolved from emsure powder merck millipore and 50 mm nacl dissolved from 99 9 powder vwr germany was used ph adjustment was done with 1 m hcl diluted from hcl 37 roth germany and 1 m naoh dissolved from emsure 99 pellets merck millipore stock solutions 1000 mg l of ha ta tea aus tann alg and glu were prepared by dissolving 0 5 g of om powder or solid weighed with an explorer ex224 analytical balance ohaus usa in 500 ml of milli q water to enhance the solubility of ha 1 g of naoh pellets was added to the ha stock solution to increase the ph to 12 13 swift 1996 fp was supplied as a viscous liquid at approximately 50000 mgc l the stock fp solution was prepared by diluting this liquid by 500 times wf stock solution was the extracted liquid from the worm farm at a concentration of 1000 mgc l dissolved organic carbon doc of the nine stock solutions was obtained by filtering these solutions through 0 45 Œºm cellulose acetate filters millisart sartorius germany om concentrations as doc of the stock solutions were 220 1200 mgc l feed solutions in filtration experiments contained 100 ng l hormone 10 mgc l om 1 mm nahco3 and 10 mm nacl diluted from the respective stock solutions in milli q water the om concentration in the feed and initial solutions was 10 mgc l which is within the doc range in surface waters aschermann et al 2016 martin mousset et al 1997 in each static adsorption experiment two solutions in separate 250 ml conical flasks were prepared flask a contained swcnts and flask b contained om and e2 nguyen et al 2020 in flask a 25 mg of swcnts weighed with the analytical balance was mixed with 50 ml of milli q water and sonicated for 1 hour in the ultrasonic bath then background electrolytes and milli q water were added to flask a to make up 125 ml of 1 mm nahco3 and 10 mm nacl in flask b a 125 ml mixture of 200 ng l e2 20 mgc l om 1 mm nahco3 and 10 mm nacl was prepared from the respective stock solutions the ph of the feed and initial solutions was adjusted to 8 1 0 2 to ensure no bias emerging from incomplete om hormone interactions the mixtures of om and hormones in both static adsorption flask b and filtration were prepared around 30 min before the respective experiments 2 7 static adsorption static adsorption was performed to investigate om interference in a ternary mixture of om e2 and swcnts as the static adsorption started the om and hormone mixture flask b in section 2 6 was transferred to the swcnt solution flask a in section 2 6 in an incubator shaker innova 43r new brunswick scientific usa to make up 250 ml of 0 1 g l swcnts 100 ng l hormone and 10 mgc l om the incubator shaker operated at a shaking speed of 260 rpm and a temperature of 20 1 c at time intervals between 5 min and 26 h 2 5 ml aliquots were extracted with a plastic syringe norm ject 10 ml hsw germany and immediately filtered with the 100 kda uf ultracel plhhk in a stainless steel membrane holder 13 mm diameter merck millipore to avoid further swcnt hormone interaction each separate membrane coupon was used for filtering the extracted solutions and recycled up to six times 2 8 swcnt uf composite preparation to incorporate swcnts in the uf support two procedures were followed as illustrated in figure s1 si for the 10 100 kda uf swcnt incorporation was done via vacuum filtration as described previously nguyen et al 2021 a 70 mm membrane coupon was placed upside down on a stainless steel support inside a glass funnel diameter 73 mm duran germany then 84 ml of swcnt suspension which corresponds to the 2 g m2 loading was poured into the funnel and a vacuum pump model fb70155 fisher scientific uk assisted swcnt deposition with a maximum pressure of 2 3 bar for the 3 5 kda uf an alternative process was used to reduce the swcnt uf preparation time the 70 mm membrane coupon was placed upside down inside a stainless steel cell with a volume capacity of 900 ml imbrogno and sch√§fer 2019 subsequently 84 ml of swcnt suspension was added to the cell the cell was then sealed and the suspension was filtered with a synthetic air pressure of 4 bar in both procedures swcnt incorporation was complete once all suspension was filtered and each swcnt loaded membrane was cut into up to four 25 mm circular membrane coupons for each experiment a 25 mm swcnt loaded uf coupon 4 9 cm2 was placed on a 25 mm pristine uf membrane of the same mwco with the dense layer of both membranes facing upwards and mounted in the membrane cell the stock swcnt suspension was kept in the fridge at 4 c and sonicated for 1 h before each subsequent incorporation 2 9 filtration system and filtration protocol the filtration system fig 2 with an effective membrane area of 2 cm2 1 2 cm determined by a feed spacer was operated in cross flow mode which reassembles the spiral wound modules imbrogno and sch√§fer 2019 and causes less fouling by hmw om compared with the dead end mode see figure s4 si this system is similar to the one described in previous work nguyen et al 2021 it must be noted that the membrane coupon with an area of 4 9 cm2 was inserted in the system while only 2 cm2 was exposed to the feed solution however there is no flow restriction inside the membrane so the full membrane area of 4 9 cm2 was accessible to some extent the filtration protocol is as described in table s1 si each experiment contains a thirty minute compaction followed by a fifteen minute pure water flux test main filtration with the om hormone solution and another fifteen minute pure water flux test four types of experiments were performed a om type b steroid hormone type c pressure flux and d membrane mwco except in experiments with pressure variation the applied pressure was fixed at 1 bar for 10 100 kda and 4 bar for 3 5 kda membranes a fixed feed flow rate of 30 ml min was set with the hplc pump in all experiments the crossflow rate and hence recovery were not controlled and could depend on the membrane permeability applied pressure and om size the temperature was not controlled and varied around 24 2 c as shown in section 8 of the si error from this variation was included in cumulative error analysis in section 3 si filtration was done until 150 ml 750 l m2 and 30 ml 150 l m2 of permeate were obtained for 30 100 kda and 3 10 kda membranes respectively 2 10 data analyses the calculations in this work are described in table 3 error analysis is given in section 3 si adsorption performance is evaluated through the determination of removal and adsorbed mass parameters with eq 3 and eq 4 respectively adsorbed masses of steroid hormones and mass loss of om are reported in section 10 si to estimate the membrane porosity with the hagen poiseuille law kirby 2010 the membrane layer is assumed to consist of multiple cylindrical pores with the same dimension with radius r p and length Œ¥ m this assumption is incorrect for the asymmetric membranes hence the application of the hagen poiseuille law results in an apparent porosity that would be valid for membranes of the same mwco and with cylindrical pores the pressure difference between the two ends is Œ¥ p water velocity in one of these cylindrical pores is determined from the hagen poiseuille law and because the pure water flux is equal to porosity multiplied by water velocity the porosity can also be expressed as given in eq 6 mochizuki and zydney 1993 3 results and discussion previous studies focus on steroid hormone removal by swcnts in static adsorption and by swcnt uf composite in filtration experiments nguyen et al 2021 nguyen et al 2020 in this study the influence of nine om types in both types of experiments was first examined followed by the investigation of om characteristics that could cause interference finally hormone removal by swcnt uf under varying conditions hormone type residence time and uf mwco was evaluated with the most interfering om type s 3 1 impact of om types in static adsorption om can influence both the e2 adsorption efficiency and kinetics of swcnts to quantify such influences static adsorption was performed with a ternary mixture of swcnt e2 and om the e2 adsorbed mass at equilibrium and k e 2 are reported in fig 3 e2 adsorbed mass as a function of time is given in figure s5 si the temperature in the incubator shaker was controlled at 20 1 c as shown in fig 3 without om e2 adsorbed mass at equilibrium was 24 5 ng when om was introduced e2 adsorbed mass decreased to 18 7 21 8 ng which indicates interference by om e2 adsorbed mass variation was not significant between the nine different om types hence a relationship between om characteristics and om interference could not be determined this observation contradicts those in other studies where strong interactions of om with both cnts and small organic molecules were linked with high om aromaticity chen et al 2007 engel and chefetz 2015 ma and yates 2018 wang et al 2009 however when evaluating a larger sample set engel and chefetz 2019 found no correlation between om aromaticity and om adsorption by cnts specifically the concentration difference between e2 and om of five orders of magnitude in this work could enhance the direct competition of om with e2 for the adsorption sites and mask the impact of om characteristics zhang et al 2010 e2 adsorption rate constant k e 2 decreased from 57 20 h 1 in the control experiment without om to around 7 23 h 1 with ta tea glu and aus in contrast k e 2 with alg tann and wf did not vary significantly from the control value e2 adsorption kinetics could be related to om size since small om compounds might diffuse into more surface area of swcnts that would not be reached by larger om compounds pan and xing 2008 hence small om could compete with e2 for the less accessible swcnt adsorption sites which potentially limited the speed of hormone adsorption when swcnts in a composite membrane were operated with short residence times of several seconds for example 0 3 3 3 s in this work table s2 si the adsorption kinetics can determine e2 adsorption and removal to evaluate the adsorption performance in short residence times the hormone breakthrough curves with swcnt uf were examined 3 2 impact of om types on e2 breakthrough with swcnt uf breakthrough curves indicate the evolution of permeate hormone concentration c p with permeate volume or time and allow qualitative evaluation of om interference in a dynamic membrane adsorption process the breakthrough experiment was performed with swcnt uf 100 kda which would not retain om except some hmw fractions and ensured little or no om shielding fig 4 shows the breakthrough curves up to 150 ml of permeate volume experimental parameters such as pressure permeate mass conductivity and temperature are given in figure s8 si values of feed retentate and permeate concentrations are given in table s4 si as shown in fig 4 the adsorption saturation where c p would be equal to the feed or retentate concentration was not reached with or without om the impact of varying om types on c p was significant ha tea fp and ta increased c p in comparison with the control experiment without om while aus alg glu tann and wf had only minor influence on c p the strongest interference was found for ta where c p at a permeate volume of 150 ml was 87 ng l which is 30 higher than that of the control 59 ng l other studies showed that ta contained a high density of aromatic rings and could induce strong œÄ œÄ interactions with both swcnts lin and xing 2008 and e2 yamamoto et al 2003 hence this om type could influence e2 adsorption by swcnt uf via both direct and indirect competition mechanisms while the breakthrough curves provide a good impression of how om interfered with e2 removal the adsorbed mass of e2 determined from the mass balance allows a more quantitative analysis of such interference 3 3 impact of om types on e2 removal by swcnt uf the performance of swcnt uf with different om types was evaluated from e2 removal e2 adsorbed mass and om removal at a permeate volume of 150 ml as shown in fig 5 the performance in control conditions i e without om is indicated by the dashed line om concentrations except for ta were determined based on the sum of organic carbon matter in the humic substances building block and lmw fractions in lc ocd and reported in table s8 ta tann tea and wf were partly adsorbed by the instrument capillaries and sec column without the influence of the feed water matrix the estimated percentages of adsorbed om to lc ocd were 50 90 table s3 si with the influence of ethanol and background electrolytes in the feed om adsorption to lc ocd appeared less significant table s8 although the reported removals of tann tea and wf are not reliable ta is an important om type because it induced the strongest interference and to solve this analytical problem the concentration was determined accurately with uv vis spectroscopy at an absorbance wavelength of 213 nm the estimated om mass loss that was determinable with lc ocd is given in figure s13 as shown in fig 5 c om types retained by the 100 kda uf include alg 95 c p approached the detection limit of 0 1 mgc l and wf 45 which could be linked to high mw interference evaluation with these om types is affected by the partial om retention of the uf from fig 5 a and b the remaining seven om types appeared to permeate completely through swcnt uf 100 kda and influenced e2 removal and adsorbed mass to specific extents in the presence of ta ha and tea e2 adsorbed mass decreased to 0 8 1 7 ng cm2 from 3 1 ng cm2 in the control experiment without om the adsorbed mass of ta was significant figure s13 which could imply direct competition of ta with e2 for adsorption sites in contrast aus and fp had a moderate negative influence on e2 adsorbed mass 2 5 ng cm2 e2 adsorption by glu and tann were similar to that of the control om interference in dynamic membrane adsorption fig 5 differs from that in static adsorption fig 3 probably because interference may have been determined by parameters that are specific for each type of experiment such as mass transfer or residence time in static adsorption the swcnt surface accessibility was important nguyen et al 2020 hence varying the om type has a stronger influence on e2 adsorption kinetics than e2 adsorbed mass at equilibrium however in dynamic membrane adsorption with short residence times e2 adsorption appeared to happen only at the most accessible surface of swcnts nguyen et al 2021 here the affinity of om for swcnts and or e2 could be a critical factor the characteristics size and aromaticity of these nine om types were subsequently evaluated to explain their interference capability 3 4 characteristics of om that affect interference fractionation in terms of composition and size of the nine om types at 5 mgc l was determined to evaluate the relationship between the om fractions and om interference with e2 adsorption lc ocd analysis was performed to quantify organic carbon in biopolymer 20 kda humic substance around 1 kda building block 300 500 da and lmw 350 da fractions villacorte et al 2010 raw organic carbon signal is plotted against elution time as shown in fig 6 concentrations of individual fractions are shown in table s3 as shown in fig 6 c f and i the peak areas corresponding to the eluted phenol rich compounds tea tann and ta appear to be relatively small because parts of these om types were adsorbed by lc ocd capillaries and sec column and hence cannot be detected om losses were estimated in table s3 si to be 50 80 and 90 for tea tann and ta respectively non ideal fractionation of hydrophobic components is the major cause of om loss in the sec column mant et al 1987 detailed characterisation of lost om is not possible when only the eluted om is considered tann gives a peak corresponding to hmw biopolymer like compounds 20 kda while ta and tea contains mainly building blocks and lmw compounds small ta and tea compounds showed the strongest interference with e2 adsorption in contrast tann with higher mw did not intervene significantly as shown in fig 6 a and b ha shows strong resemblance to nom for example aus because both om types contain mainly fractions in the humic substance 1 kda region thurman 1985 the mw of humic substance fraction of aus is lower than that of ha according to lc ocd characterisation table s3 but both om types intervened similarly with e2 adsorption by swcnt uf fig 5 from fig 6 g and h substantial size difference is observed for fp and wf which are both products of biodegradation fp from the industrial fermentation process shows two building block and lmw fractions of similar maximum intensities whereas the home made wf shows a double peak indicating a mix of biopolymers and humic substances the size difference between wf and fp minimally affected e2 adsorbed mass in the filtration with swcnt uf fig 5 in the dynamic membrane adsorption process om size appeared not to be the deciding factor in om interference however in static adsorption the kinetic rate constant k e 2 was lower for small om types such as aus tea ta and glu fig 3 the only exception was small fp where k e 2 was high small om diffusing into the less accessible surface of swcnts could compete with e2 and hence reduce the kinetics of e2 mp adsorption pan and xing 2008 in the next step om aromaticity was determined to investigate whether this characteristic was linked to om interference the ratio between the uv absorbance at 254 nm and the toc concentration eq 8 referred to as the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva254 is commonly used to characterise aromaticity matilainen et al 2011 weishaar et al 2003 the higher suva254 the higher the content of aromatic rings suva254 of the nine om types measured with the uv vis spectrometer and toc analyzer are given in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 ha has a relatively high suva254 of 7 7 l mg m which characterised highly aromatic and hydrophobic compounds edzwald 1993 in contrast ta tann tea wf and aus have relatively lower suva254 of 2 4 l mg m so these om types are less aromatic than ha certain om types with high or moderate aromaticity such as ta tea ha and aus induced the strongest interference with e2 adsorption by swcnt uf fig 5 as such œÄ œÄ stacking can be an important interaction between om and swcnt or e2 in contrast fp alg and glu have near zero suva254 these om types have little impact on e2 adsorbed mass by swcnt uf which implies that h bonding may not be responsible for interference within short residence times in summary aromatic rings in om have the greatest direct impact on the interference with dynamic e2 adsorption by swcnt uf om size is not directly related to interference although aromatic om appeared to affect e2 adsorption strongly if the om was small such as in the cases of tea and ta for example next the impact of other filtration variables hormone type residence time and uf mwco is evaluated in the presence of ta which induced the strongest interference 3 5 impact of hormone types on om ta interference each steroid hormone type has distinct characteristics nguyen et al 2020 and can induce specific interactions with adsorbents and om to evaluate the adsorption of other hormone types e1 t and p by swcnt uf filtration experiments were performed with and without ta hormone removal hormone adsorbed mass and ta removal at 150 ml of permeate volume with swcnt uf 100 kda are shown in fig 8 ta was determined from uv absorbance at 213 nm ta adsorbed mass is given in figure s14 and experimental parameters such as pressure permeate mass conductivities and temperature are shown in figure s9 si from fig 8 b without om the adsorbed mass of p was highest 5 5 ng cm2 followed by those of e2 and t around 3 ng cm2 the adsorbed mass of e1 was the lowest 2 3 ng cm2 similar trend in adsorbed mass was reported with swcnt uf 10 kda in previous work where it was indicated that hormone adsorption was driven by the interactions at the most accessible swcnt surface nguyen et al 2021 as shown in fig 8 a ta interfered with the adsorption of all four hormone types as r h reduced drastically to below 10 for e1 e2 and t and slightly from 80 to 70 for p according to fig 8 c the difference in ta removal was not significant within error ta adsorbed mass is given in figure s14 indicating that more ta was adsorbed in the presence of p than e1 e2 and t ta appeared to interact strongly with p and was adsorbed by swcnts along with this hormone type although data may not be reliable at low ta retention neale et al 2009 observed stronger interactions of ta with p and e1 than with e2 and t and suggested that p and e1 had hydrogen accepting ketone groups that enhanced their interactions with ta interference due to ta e1 interactions cannot be assumed in this work because the adsorption of both e1 and ta by swcnt uf was low through the specific case of p it was hypothesised that the ta hormone interactions were relevant to hormone adsorption by swcnt uf as such ta competed indirectly with steroid hormones for adsorption sites 3 6 impact of flux residence time on om interference since steroid hormone adsorption by swcnt uf is a kinetic process the residence time t r of the hormones determines the adsorption efficiency by adjusting the pressure the flux could be varied and hence t r to determine whether e2 adsorption by swcnt uf 10 kda was limited by t r from 6 6 to 0 8 s in the presence of ta e2 filtration experiment was performed at different pressures from 0 5 to 4 bar fig 9 shows e2 removal e2 adsorbed mass and ta removal at 30 ml of permeate volume as functions of flux and t r ta was determined from uv absorbance at 213 nm complementary ta mass loss is given in figure s15 si experimental parameters such as pressure permeate mass conductivities and temperature are given in figure s10 si according to fig 9 a and b e2 removal and adsorbed mass in all ta experiments were independent of flux and residence time with values around 20 and 0 5 ng cm2 respectively similar e2 adsorption observations were reported in previous work without om nguyen et al 2021 where the swcnt surface was in excess and e2 adsorption at the most accessible sites was fast and not controlled by residence time between 0 08 and 7 1 s similarly although ta negatively affected e2 removal by swcnt uf ta did not appear to control the kinetic process of e2 adsorption at the most accessible swcnt surface therefore it was hypothesised that ta reduced the affinity of e2 for swcnts via ta e2 interactions i e indirect competition might occur the ta e2 interactions were favoured by the relatively long contact time of 30 min between the two species prior to the filtration experiment from fig 9 c the swcnt uf 10 kda partially removed ta 1 7 kda and ta removal appeared to increase with flux from around 37 at 16 l m2 h to 61 at 103 l m2 h however this variation in ta removal did not affect e2 adsorption by the permeate side swcnts ta removal could be attributed to either adsorption or retention adsorbed mass of ta did not vary significantly with flux at around 0 1 mgc cm2 figure s15 therefore it was implied that the trend in ta removal was due to ta retention probably because the flux of ta was lower than that of water and this flux difference increased with pressure in summary e2 removal with swcnt uf was low and independent of residence time 0 8 6 6 s in the presence of ta this implies a disadvantage to the filtration process because the intervention of this om type would not be alleviated by increasing the flow rate or pressure 3 7 impact of uf mwco on om interference and the shielding of uf certain fractions of the om can be removed by the uf mwco aoustin et al 2001 taniguchi et al 2003 therefore the interference from these fractions may be controlled in this section the mwco of swcnt uf was varied from 3 to 100 kda ha mw 4 7 30 4 kda see table 2 was selected in addition to ta 1 7 kda because shielding by uf might be more effective against the higher mw om type e2 removal e2 adsorbed mass and ta ha removal as a function of uf mwco are given in fig 10 the total permeate volume was 30 ml for 1 10 kda membranes and 150 ml for 30 100 kda membranes ta concentration was determined from uv absorbance at 213 nm whereas ha concentration was determined from the sum of humic substance building block and lmw concentrations in lc ocd with an uncertainty of 13 due to ha adsorption in the sec column table s3 si mass loss of ta ha is given in figure s6 experimental parameters such as pressure permeate mass conductivities and temperature are given in figures s11 and s12 si from fig 10 c ta removal decreased with mwco but even the lowest mwco of 3 kda could only retain about 80 of ta therefore the shielding of uf against ta was not efficient and as shown in fig 10 a ta permeation decreased r e 2 to 48 from 82 in the control experiment without om with swcnt uf 3 kda fig 10 c also shows that unlike ta ha was almost completely retained 95 99 removal by swcnt uf 3 10 kda since minimal ha concentration was found in the permeate of these membranes near complete ha retention by the same uf mwcos was also reported in the literature aoustin et al 2001 lowe and hossain 2008 wolters et al 2019 with efficient ha shielding by tight uf 3 10 kda as shown in fig 10 a and b e2 removal and adsorbed mass were similar between the ha and control no om experiments an increase in e2 removal due to the interactions between retained ha ta and e2 was not observed fig 10 a in dead end filtration experiments jermann et al 2009 reported a slight increase in e2 removal by 100 kda uf due to 10 mgc l ha neale and sch√§fer 2012 determined that 18 e2 was partitioned to ha and e2 ha interactions increased e2 removal by 1 100 kda uf by 2 3 times in contrast e2 removal enhancement due to ta ha was not observed with swcnt uf in this work probably because the amount of permeating e2 did not affect e2 adsorption this is attributed to the fact that the swcnt adsorption sites were in excess because the main fractions of nom are humic substances and most of these are humic acids in natural water the low uf mwco potentially shields the interference of a relatively wide range of om in real waters however in the operation of such low mwco membranes higher operating pressures and costs may be required to achieve the same productivity small and hydrophobic compounds in water similar to ta cannot be controlled by the uf mwco and may be detrimental to the adsorption performance of the composite membrane if these compounds occur at significant concentrations 4 conclusions in this work the interference of nine om types with different characteristics on hormone removal by an adsorptive swcnt uf membrane was investigated all om types interfered with e2 removal by swcnt uf in dynamic membrane experiments to varying extents aromatic om types especially those with low mw such as ta impacted e2 removal most drastically both e2 and ta were adsorbed by swcnt uf which could imply that ta competed directly with e2 for adsorption sites ta also strongly reduced e1 and t adsorption but only slightly affected p adsorption in addition reducing the residence time from 6 6 to 0 8 s did not affect hormone removal in the presence of ta it was then hypothesised that ta reduced the affinity of e2 for swcnts ta shielding 1 7 kda was not effective with uf mwco as low as 3 kda however humic acids 4 7 30 4 kda were well retained 95 99 by the mwco range of 3 10 kda and in consequence a high e2 removal of 80 was achieved similar to the control experiment without om this indicates successful control of interference while the adsorbents still need optimisation to achieve the european drinking water target of 1 ng l for e2 european parliament 2018 the enhanced adsorption performance due to om shielding is important swcnt uf can promise good performance with real waters where the humic like compounds that constitute the majority of nom are removed however small and aromatic om species in the feed that is similar to ta are not controlled and may cause unwanted interference declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements sartorius germany and merck millipore usa are thanked for

16959,ultraviolet based advanced oxidation processes uv aops are very promising in advanced treatment of municipal secondary effluents however the transformation of dissolved effluent organic matter defom in advanced treatment of real wastewater particularly at molecular level remains unclear in this study fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms coupled with multiple statistical analysis were performed to better understand the transformation of defom in uv h2o2 uv persulfate uv ps and uv chlorine treatments an obvious increase in oxygen content of defom was observed after every uv aops treatment and the detailed oxygenation processes were further uncovered by mass difference analysis based on 24 types of typical reactions generally uv h2o2 process was subjected to the most oxygenation reactions with the typical tri hydroxylation one 3o whereas di hydroxylation reaction h2o2 was dominant in uv ps and uv chlorine processes additionally the three uv aops shared the majority of precursors and more proportions of unique products were identified for each process the precursors with lower h c and higher aromaticity were readily degraded by uv chlorine over uv h2o2 and uv ps with the products featuring lower molecular weight moreover defom of high aromaticity tended to produce chlorinated byproducts through addition reactions in chlorination and uv chlorine processes among these uv aops the highest reduction of both acute toxicity and specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 was observed for uv chlorine implying the potential for uv chlorine process in advanced treatment of wastewater in addition acute toxicity was highly correlated with suva254 and chos compounds this study is believed to help better understand the different fates of defom in real wastewater during uv aops treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved effluent organic matter uv aops ft icr ms mass difference analysis

scarcity binz et al 2016 jin et al 2016 municipal wastewater is usually considered as an important source of reclaimed water due to its large yield and relatively high quality over industrial

pollutants e g endocrine disrupting compounds pharmaceuticals personal care products residues and pesticides chen et al 2017 michael kordatou et al 2015 tang et al 2014 consequently advanced treatment of municipal secondary effluent is a requisite step to address such adverse effects before water reuse knopp et al 2016 michael kordatou et al 2015 miklos et al 2018 tang et al 2013 ultraviolet based advanced oxidation processes uv aops including uv h2o2 uv persulfate uv ps and uv chlorine have been recognized as promising technologies in advanced treatment of municipal secondary effluent li et al

micro pollutants miklos et al 2018 miklos et al 2019 varanasi et al 2018 and full scale applications of uv aops including uv h2o2 audenaert et al 2011 horstmeyer et al 2018 and uv chlorine miklos et al 2018 have been reported for water reuse due to the unique characteristics of three types of free radicals the reaction mechanisms involved in these processes are quite distinct generally ho reacts non selectively with organic compounds through a series of reactions including hydrogen abstraction electron transfer and addition gligorovski et al 2015 comparatively so4 is more preferable for electron transfer reactions and less for hydrogen abstraction or addition reactions rendering it more selective to electron rich moieties nihemaiti et al 2018 in addition cl could attack electron rich

2020 pan et al 2017 yang et al 2016 yang et al 2019 in addition miklos et al 2019 reported faster degradation of uv chlorine than uv ps and uv h2o2 toward some trace organic chemicals e g caffeine carbamazepine primidone benzotriazole etc as well as higher selectivity in uv ps and uv chlorine than uv h2o2 by contrast limited studies are available concerning the transformation of complicated dissolved organic matters dom during uv aops mediated water wastewater treatment chen et al 2017 varanasi et al 2018 wang et al 2017 reported that chromophores and fluorophores of natural organic matter nom could be effectively destroyed during uv chlorine treatment by using spectroscopic characterization in addition defom with higher molecular weight mw was more readily degraded in uv h2o2 and uv ps based on chromatographic analysis chen et al 2017 in spite of some valuable information available based on the analytical methods mentioned above it is still far from systematically exploring the molecular transformation of dom in the uv aops the development of high resolution mass spectrometry hrms provides the possibility for deciphering the molecular composition of complex dom systems varanasi et al 2018 ever investigated the transformation of nom during three uv aops treatment using orbitrap ms they revealed that aliphatic compounds underwent an evident transformation in uv h2o2 and uv chorine whereas aromatic and olefinic ones were subjected to more readily degradation in uv ps compared with orbitrap ms fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is more powerful to characterize molecular composition of complicated dom with the highest resolution and mass accuracy up to date hawkes et al 2016 marshall and chen 2015 currently increasing studies are available to employ ft icr ms to characterize the molecular composition and or transformation of nom in natural water bodies hao et al 2017 kellerman et al 2015 lavonen et al 2015 mcdonough et al 2020 osterholz et al 2015 whereas limited studies fell in the field of wastewater treatment geng et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b in a very recent study fang et al 2020 reported the transformation of dom in uv aops treatment of oil sands processing wastewater based on ft icr ms analysis and naphthenic acids o2 species were found to exhibit the highest removal in uv ps while more nitrogen containing compounds were degraded in uv chlorine these studies indicated that the performance of uv aops depended upon the dom composition and water matrix significantly however understanding the transformation of defom in municipal wastewater during uv aops treatment particularly at molecular level still remains unclear in this study we employed ft icr ms to characterize the advanced treatment of municipal secondary effluent by using three uv aops in an attempt to better understand the molecular transformation of defom the common and unique precursors and products in these processes were identified and the possible precursor product pairs were deciphered based on 24 types of typical reactions further the chlorinated byproducts cl bps were detected along with the identification of their possible precursors the acute toxicity of all the samples before and after treatments was examined and its correlation with other parameters was established we believe this study could advance the understanding of molecular transformation of defom as induced by various free radicals in real wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials secondary effluent sample was

a 900 ml cylindrical borosilicate glass reactor equipped with a low pressure mercury lamp 254 nm 28 w shanghai jiguang special lighting appliance factory in a quartz sleeve the reactor was placed in a thermostatic water bath coupled with magnetic stirring to maintain the reaction temperature of 25 1 c the photon flux i 0 entering the solution was measured to be 2 72 Œºeinstein s 1 by using iodide

on the measurement of h2o2 photolysis kinetics li et al 2012 oxidants 0 50 mm h2o2 ps or free chlorine were spiked into 900 ml secondary effluent to initiate the experiments and the reaction solutions were simultaneously exposed to uv lamp for 20 min the uv lamp was preheated for at least 15 min before experiments after 20 min reaction the solutions quenched by sodium sulfite were collected to determine the concentrations of thms and haas and the non quenched solutions were sampled to measure the concentrations of the residual oxidants immediately in addition 700 ml quenched samples were used to conduct solid phase extraction spe for ft icr ms and acute toxicity analysis two spe cartridges agilent bond elut ppl 1 g 6 ml tandem merk lichrolut en 200 mg 3 ml were coupled for defom extraction with the procedures described in our recent studies zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2021 and the extraction efficiencies fell in the range of 53 2 62 2 table s2 note that the ph values of all samples were adjusted by formic acid rather than hydrochloric acid to avoid the formation of false positive cl containing compounds during spe processes gonsior et al 2015 phungsai et al 2016 sanchis et al 2020 besides the control tests of uv chlorination h2o2 or ps alone were performed under otherwise identical conditions to the corresponding uv aops due to the inappreciable changes of uv254 and the concentrations of h2o2 and ps the reaction systems of h2o2 alone and ps alone were not discussed in this study all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 general water parameters the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was determined by a toc lcsh analyzer shimadzu japan a uv 2600 spectrophotometer shimadzu japan was used to record the uv absorbance at 254 nm and the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 was calculated by normalizing uv254 to doc concentration weishaar et al 2003 other analytical methods are detailed in text s1 2 3 2 oxidants

scientific usa equipped with an electron capture detector ecd ristoiu et al 2009 sweetman et al 2018 the chromatographic column of tg 5ms 30 m 0 32 mm 0 25 ¬µm was used in this study with the detector

tbaa dibromoacetic acid dbaa monobromoacetic acid mbaa bromochloroacetic acid bcaa bromodichloroacetic acid bdcaa and chlorodibromoacetic acid cdbaa were measured by an ion chromatography with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with the detailed procedures described by cheng et al 2021 2 3 3 ft icr ms the dom samples were analyzed by a 15 t ft icr ms solarix bruker equipped with an electrospray ionization esi source in negative ionization mode other instrument parameters and operating conditions were consistent with our previous work zhang et al 2021 molecular formulae were assigned by matlab algorithms created by fu et al 2020a 2020b elemental composition was restricted with the combination of 12c1 60 1h1 120 16o1 50 14n0 5 32s0 3 31p0 2 35cl0 3 and only the peaks with signal to noise ratios 5 were considered during molecule assignment other restrictions of molecular composition are described in text s2 for a given formula the error between the measured mw and the theoretical one was set to 0 5 ppm and only the formulae coexisting in triplicated samples were retained to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of the detection hao et al 2017 lv et al 2018 the common formulae of each process were used to conduct further analysis for cl containing formulae the final verification was conducted by isotopic simulation according to the abundance ratio of 35cl 37cl 3 1 2 3 4 acute toxicity luminescent bacteria photobacterium t3 were resuscitated using 1 ml of 2 5 nacl in low temperature environment 4 c the 10 Œºl of bacteria solution was added into 2 ml samples diluted by 3 nacl with the concentration factor of 8 and 3 nacl solution was set for the control test weng et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a after 10 min exposure the luminosity was recorded by a biological toxicity analyzer dxy 3 nanjing institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences each sample was measured in triplicate the inhibition rate of luminescent bacteria was calculated by dividing the luminosity of sample by the control test the higher inhibition rate implies higher acute toxicity 2 4 statistical analysis to better investigate the molecular transformation of defom the compounds were classified into three categories of precursors products and resistants the classification process is detailed and illustrated in fig s1 first shapiro wilk test was used to determine the normality of the peak intensities of each coexisting formula in parallel samples seidel et al 2016 second if the peak intensities of a certain formula existing in both samples before and after treatment follow normal distribution the paired student s t test was applied to assess whether the peak intensities have changed significantly before and after treatment while the wilcoxon signed ranks test was used for abnormally distributed data sanchis et al 2020 the compounds with significant increase p value 0 05 in the peak intensity treated sample versus raw sample were considered to be products by contrast the ones with significant decline p value 0 05 in peak intensity treated sample versus raw sample were assigned as precursors all the test processes were performed in r software mathsoft version 4 0 3 the possible precursor product pairs were matched by mass difference analysis between all precursors and all products the detailed procedures are available from our recent work zhang et al 2021 the correlation analysis was performed in r software using corrgram package 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes of general properties after different treatments as shown in table 1 the doc removal was not noticeable during the treatment of uv alone chlorination and uv aops the highest doc removal of 6 95 was observed in uv ps implying the negligible mineralization ability of these systems toward defom miklos et al 2019 has also reported the similar mineralization rate 5 of trace organic chemicals in municipal wastewater during uv aops treatment under similar conditions to this study as a surrogate parameter for aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 suva254 dropped down to different extents in all the systems indicating the destruction of chromophores with conjugated double bond structures and or aromatic rings of defom notably the overall trend of the suva254 decline followed the order of uv chlorine uv ps uv h2o2 uv chlorination with the highest value of 80 93 for uv chlorine which might be related to its high radical yield li et al 2017 another important reason is possibly that cl features higher reactivity and more selectivity than ho toward electron rich compounds e g phenolic aromatic and aniline compounds pan et al 2017 in addition the ph values exhibited insignificant variation in all the systems indicating the strong buffering capacity of the test wastewater 3 2 overview of molecular composition of defom before and after treatment as shown in figs s2 s3 the molecular composition of secondary effluent mainly included cho chos and chon compounds compared with natural water chos compounds of high abundance in secondary effluent were likely to come from surfactants used in domestic detergents gonsior et al 2011 after treatments except chlorination the relative abundance of chos compounds was reduced obviously whereas an opposite trend was observed for cho compounds the similar result was observed in the transformation of defom during ozonation zhang et al 2021 implying that chos compounds might be easily destroyed and finally transformed into cho compounds during oxidation dai et al 2014 kalinski et al 2014 as expected both the number and the relative abundance of cl containing compounds increased clearly after chlorination and uv chlorine treatment figs s2c f and s3a and table s3 in viewpoint of the compound classes the highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and aliphatic compounds represented the predominant compounds of all test samples fig s3b 3 3 molecular transformation of defom in different processes 3 3 1 overview of the transformation to reflect and compare the overall changes of molecular parameters the intensity weighted averaged wa values were calculated according to the corresponding equations described elsewhere yuan et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 after treatment of three uv aops uv alone and chlorination respectively the values of h cwa o cwa and nominal oxidation state of carbon noscwa increased to some extent with the maximum increment of o cwa and noscwa observed in uv h2o2 table 1 obviously and understandably the reaction of oxygen addition is a common reaction in all the oxidation processes especially for those using ho as the main active species for instance the reaction of hydroxylation was extensively reported in uv h2o2 huang et al 2020 ja√©n gil et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 in addition the oxidation state of defom was increased after uv aops treatment which matches well with the increase of oxygen content on the contrary the molecular level parameters of double bond equivalent dbewa and modified aromaticity index aimodwa declined after treatment the maximum decrement of both parameters occurred in uv chlorine and was consistent with the observation of the reduction rate of suva254 the aforementioned results demonstrated that the unsaturated and aromatic compounds could be destroyed in the oxidation processes and rcs possessed the stronger reaction ability toward these compounds in fact hua et al 2021 have recently reported that clo played an important role in the transformation of defom with the reaction rate of 3 8 10 4 s 1 one order of magnitude higher than ho of 2 7 10 5 s 1 herein van krevelen diagrams of precursors products and resistants were employed to further characterize the molecular transformation of defom after different treatments of note is that the macromolecular compounds mw 1000 da were rarely detected on the basis of esi ft icr ms analysis possibly due to the difficult ionization or limited stability for these compounds in electrospray process these and reemtsma 2003 therefore only those of mw lower than 1000 da were discussed as illustrated in fig 1 the number of precursors and products in uv alone and chlorination was much lower than three uv aops implying that more transformation reactions arose in the latter reaction systems more specifically the number of precursors in different uv aops processes followed the order of uv chlorine uv h2o2 uv ps whereas the number of products and resistants matched a different trend of uv ps uv h2o2 uv chlorine this result once again suggested that uv chlorine possessed the highest reactivity with defom consistent with the oxygenation nature of the processes the precursors mainly featured low oxygen compounds o c 0 5 whereas the products mainly featured high oxygen ones o c 0 5 figs 1 and s4 to further explore the molecular transformation of oxygen containing compounds the distribution of o x species of precursors and products is displayed in fig s5 it clearly shows that the distribution of o x species of precursors was close to a normal distribution of one peak with o6 7 species as the most abundant ones just like that of the ozonation process zhang et al 2021 however two predominant peaks were observed for that of the products one with the abundant species of o11 12 for uv h2o2 and uv ps and the other with those of o7 8 for uv chlorine implying the weakest ability of the addition of multiple oxygen atoms for uv chlorine among three uv aops it might be ascribed to the lowest steady state concentration of ho in uv chlorine among these three processes hua et al 2021 further analysis was conducted to reveal the molecular dissimilarities of precursors and products in these reactions as shown in fig 2 a the majority of precursors overlapped among uv h2o2 uv ps and uv chlorine processes and only 258 8 29 30 1 22 and 395 11 76 precursors were exclusively unique for the three systems respectively in addition the unique precursors mainly featured h c of 1 40 2 20 and aimod of 0 0 25 for uv h2o2 while those for uv chlorine principally featured h c of 1 00 1 40 and aimod of 0 15 0 70 fig 2b c hence compounds of higher aromaticity and or unsaturated degree were more readily decomposed in uv chlorine than in uv h2o2 interestingly the number of common compounds in products significantly decreased 968 in products versus 2293 in precursors and the proportions of the unique products rose up to 25 26 23 83 and 28 89 for uv h2o2 uv ps and uv chlorine respectively fig 2d suggesting the distinct mechanisms of three uv aops exerting on the common compounds as evident from fig 2e f the unique products for uv chlorine were primarily concentrated at the range of mw 450 and c 20 whereas those of higher mw molecules were observed for uv h2o2 and uv ps it implied that the compounds of higher mw were more readily decomposed into lower ones during uv chlorine similar results were reported that the higher mw fractions of nom were degraded more rapidly than the lower ones during uv chlorine treatment wang et al 2017 moreover the values of h c of unique compounds in uv h2o2 is slightly lower than uv ps the different reactivity of three uv aops toward nom has been reported varanasi et al 2018 and the highest reactivity was observed between unsaturated compounds and so4 produced in uv ps however it is uv chlorine that was the most reactive in this study table 1 and figs 2 3 possibly arising from their different dom composition water matrix and oxidant dosage 3 3 2 chlorinated byproducts cl bps the concentration and composition of cl bps have been continuously concerned during water and wastewater treatment in consideration of their potential effect most unfavorable on the ecosystem hua et al 2021 phungsai et al 2018 2019 zhang et al 2012 first the concentrations of 13 known cl bps 4 thms and 9 haas were detected in this study from fig s6a b one can see that thms and haas in secondary effluent remained at a relatively low level 0 25 1 25 Œºg l and the processes of uv alone uv h2o2 and uv ps did not significantly increase their concentrations however chlorination and uv chlorine increased their concentrations dramatically to 45 85 106 69 Œºg l in these cl bps the dominant classes were trichloromethane dichloroacetic acid and monochloroacetic acid similar results were reported elsewhere hua et al 2021 wang et al 2017 which mainly arose from the substitution and addition reactions between chlorine free radicals and dom in addition 105 and 322 cl bps of unknown structures were identified for chlorination and uv chlorine respectively based on ft icr ms analysis fig s6c d and the excel table in si from the perspective of elemental composition the most abundant class of these unknown cl bps was chocl accounting for 68 57 and 83 95 in addition the proportions of choscl were 27 62 and 15 43 respectively a little higher than the chlorination and uv chlorine treatment of nom bulman and remucal 2020 ruan et al 2021 xiang et al 2020 this dissimilarity could be primarily attributed to the higher percentage of chos compounds in the secondary effluent of note is that the compound c12h19o8cl3 was presented throughout all the samples before and after treatment with relatively high intensity suggesting its high stability against uv aops it was further proved to be sucralose based on ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry analysis fig s7 note that sucralose is an artificial sweetener ubiquitous in water environment toth et al 2012 and it could induce glucose intolerance by altering the intestinal microbiota suez et al 2014 obviously how to achieve its efficient removal should be of concern in advanced wastewater treatment 3 4 identification of possible precursor product pairs as shown in fig 1f 711 3360 precursors and 735 2178 products were identified in different reaction systems indicating the complex transformation reactions in these processes to better understand the transformation processes in such a complex defom system mass difference analysis an effective approach to correlate the precursors and products lian et al 2020 raeke et al 2017 scholl√©e et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 was employed on the basis of 24 types of transformation reactions table s4 that have been reported in uv aops as depicted in fig 3a the oxygenation reactions occupied the absolute predominance in all the reaction systems with the highest oxygenation number for uv h2o2 which is consistent with its highest increment of o cwa table 1 the vast majority of oxygenation reactions were possibly associated with ho available in all the uv aops varanasi et al 2018 more specifically the reaction of addition of 3 oxygen atoms 3o was the most common reaction in uv h2o2 which could proceed via tri hydroxylation between ho and organic matter ja√©n gil et al 2021 however the most common reaction in uv ps and uv chlorine was di hydroxylation h2o2 note that this di hydroxylation was quite distinct to the common oxygenation reaction with an extra addition of 2 hydrogen atoms and its occurrence requires the presence of unsaturated bonds e g c c in the organic substrate pan et al 2017 yang et al 2017 in addition dealkylation e g ch2 c2h4 and c3h6 and dehydrogenation 2h were relatively common for all the uv aops in addition the reactions of chlorine addition only obviously existed in chlorination and uv chlorine where the reaction of hclo possessed the largest reaction number of 86 and 14 respectively for different compound categories e g cho chon chos and chons their possible precursor product pairs which are also based on the these transformation reactions 24 types could be revealed in fig s8 generally the total number of the reactions followed the order of cho chos chon chons and the highest number of cho compounds was consistent with their maximum proportion in defom note that chon compounds were proved to be the most reactive category during ozonation of defom due to the high reactivity between amines and ozone zhang et al 2021 in addition the number of 3o and h2o2 reactions in cho and chos compounds was comparable in uv ps and uv chlorine whereas the dominant h2o2 reaction occurred in chon and chons compounds implying that the reaction of di hydroxylation might be more likely to occur between ho and n containing compounds with unsaturated bonds moreover the reactions of deamination and denitration were mainly observed in chon compounds rather than chons compounds in such complex reaction systems each precursor and product could participate in multiple reactions lian et al 2020 scholl√©e et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 among 24 types of transformation reactions considered in this study each precursor could be associated with 1 to 12 products in three uv aops and each product could be associated with 1 to 16 precursors in three uv aops for example the precursor of c15h18o5 was involved in the formation of 6 cl bps c15h17o5cl c15h17o6cl c15h19o6cl c15h16o8cl2 c15h18o6cl2 and c15h20o7cl2 through different chlorine addition reactions fig 3b on the contrary the cl bp of c15h18o6cl2 could be transformed from 4 precursors c15h18o5 c15h16o4 c15h20o6 and c15h18o5 the distributions of all the precursors and products are presented in figs s9 s11 totally the number of possible precursor product pairs accounted for more than 73 of the number of precursors during uv aops the precursors associated with multiple reactions featured higher h c lower aimod and dbe values whereas the products associated with multiple reactions featured lower h c higher aimod and dbe values hereinto 312 possible precursor product pairs were identified for the unknown cl bps in chlorination and uv chlorine the corresponding precursors of these cl bps primarily possessed higher h c and lower o c values h c 0 80 and o c 0 55 the precursors participated in the addition reactions e g hclo h2cl2o2 and cl2o featured lower h c values than those of substitute reactions e g cl h clo h 2cl 2h and cl2o3 2h fig 4 a like the chlorination and uv chlorine treatment of nom ruan et al 2021 the precursors associated with addition reactions usually have higher aimod values than those involved in substitute reactions fig 4b implying that defom of high aromaticity tends to produce cl bps through addition reactions it also showed that the precursors involved in substitute reactions if with higher h c and lower aimod values could participate in more reactions moreover the cl bps produced by addition reactions featured lower o c and higher carbon number fig 4c d most of the cl bps involved in multiple addition reactions featured one chlorine atom while those in substitute reactions possessed two chlorine atoms in addition the cl bps and their corresponding precursors for the chos compounds had higher o c and lower aimod values fig s12 3 5 changes of acute toxicity and its correlation with other parameters the changes of acute toxicity of the effluent samples before and after treatment were evaluated by using photobacterium t3 cell epa 1995 weng et al 2018 and the results are shown in fig 5 one can see that the inhibition rates decreased for all the treatments following the order of uv chlorine uv h2o2 uv ps uv alone chlorination plewa et al 2012 reported that both the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity could be reduced during uv chlorine treatment of drinking water in addition hua et al 2021 reported that the concentrations of cl bps thms and haas increased significantly after uv chlorine treatment of municipal wastewater whereas the acute toxicity and genotoxicity decreased by 19 and 76 respectively it is very similar to this study and more than 300 unknown cl bps produced in uv chlorine generally cl bps are usually associated with potential carcinogenicity and developmental and reproductive toxicity richardson et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 thus further study is required to elucidate such discrepancy between their structure and concentration and the acute toxicity and the matrix effect of the sample vughs et al 2018 as well as the pretreatment of solid phase extraction in toxicological experiments may be considered in addition other toxicological methods such as the evaluations of chronic toxicity and cytotoxicity using zebra fish and human cells may be employed to evaluate the safety of the treated samples from different perspectives the proportion of macromolecular compounds mw 1000 da in defom is usually much lower than those with mw 1000 da wu et al 2020 in terms of toxicity the low mw fraction 1000 da in wastewater was usually regarded as the major contributor of toxicity aviani et al 2009 lv et al 2017 possibly based on the above considerations the correlation analyses between bulk parameters e g suva254 and acute toxicity and molecular formulae have been extensively reported hao et al 2018 kellerman et al 2018 maizel and remucal 2017 zito et al 2019 here the correlation analysis was also employed fig s13 shows the relationships among the acute toxicity suva254 the relative abundance of cho chos chon and chons compounds as well as the molecular level parameters as observed the acute toxicity showed significantly positive correlation with suva254 and the relative abundance of chos compounds p values 0 01 and 0 001 suggesting that the chos compounds and aromatic compounds might account for acute toxicity directly moreover the positive correlation between suva254 and aimodwa further confirmed the reliability of suva254 as a surrogate parameter for aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 4 conclusions and environmental implications most defom underwent structural transformation rather than mineralization in three uv aops with the highest mineralization rate of 6 95 only in uv ps on the basis of multiple statistical test methods the precursors were identified and featured lower o c values in uv aops whereas the products possessed higher ones uv chlorine could transform the largest number of precursors and the maximum increment of o c values was observed in uv h2o2 the three uv aops shared the majority of precursors whereas the unique products for each process were relatively high the unique precursors possessed lower h c and higher aimod values for uv chlorine than for uv h2o2 and the mw of products of uv chlorine was lower than the other two uv aops the oxygenation reactions were the most frequently detected in three uv aops in detail tri hydroxylation reaction 3o featured the largest number of precursor product pairs in uv h2o2 while di hydroxylation reaction h2o2 did in the other twos the reactions of chlorine addition were commonly observed in chlorination and uv chlorine and 351 cl bps of unknown structures were identified together with 312 of their precursor product pairs this study provided the molecular level transformation properties of defom in real matrix during three typical uv aops which may be helpful to guide the choice of appropriate uv aop process for advanced treatment of a given effluent for instance compared with uv h2o2 and uv ps uv chlorine exhibited the highest degradation of unsaturated aromatic compounds and reduction of acute toxicity in addition uv chlorine was favorable to enhance the adsorption efficiency of dom in post treatment by activated carbon xing et al 2019 yin and shang 2020 thus uv chlorine may be a potential option in advanced treatment of municipal secondary effluents especially for those containing aromatic micro pollutants however it should be further concerned in case high concentration of bromine ion is present in the effluent which may bring about the formation of brominated by products br bps of higher toxicity than their chlorinated analogues dong et al 2017 therefore the comprehensive toxicity evaluation seems necessary in these reaction systems when considered for practical

16959,ultraviolet based advanced oxidation processes uv aops are very promising in advanced treatment of municipal secondary effluents however the transformation of dissolved effluent organic matter defom in advanced treatment of real wastewater particularly at molecular level remains unclear in this study fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms coupled with multiple statistical analysis were performed to better understand the transformation of defom in uv h2o2 uv persulfate uv ps and uv chlorine treatments an obvious increase in oxygen content of defom was observed after every uv aops treatment and the detailed oxygenation processes were further uncovered by mass difference analysis based on 24 types of typical reactions generally uv h2o2 process was subjected to the most oxygenation reactions with the typical tri hydroxylation one 3o whereas di hydroxylation reaction h2o2 was dominant in uv ps and uv chlorine processes additionally the three uv aops shared the majority of precursors and more proportions of unique products were identified for each process the precursors with lower h c and higher aromaticity were readily degraded by uv chlorine over uv h2o2 and uv ps with the products featuring lower molecular weight moreover defom of high aromaticity tended to produce chlorinated byproducts through addition reactions in chlorination and uv chlorine processes among these uv aops the highest reduction of both acute toxicity and specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 was observed for uv chlorine implying the potential for uv chlorine process in advanced treatment of wastewater in addition acute toxicity was highly correlated with suva254 and chos compounds this study is believed to help better understand the different fates of defom in real wastewater during uv aops treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved effluent organic matter uv aops ft icr ms mass difference analysis

scarcity binz et al 2016 jin et al 2016 municipal wastewater is usually considered as an important source of reclaimed water due to its large yield and relatively high quality over industrial

of municipal secondary effluent is a requisite step to address such adverse effects before water reuse knopp et al 2016 michael kordatou et al 2015 miklos et al 2018 tang et al 2013 ultraviolet based advanced oxidation processes uv aops including uv h2o2 uv persulfate uv ps and uv chlorine have been recognized as promising technologies in advanced treatment of municipal secondary effluent li et al

non selectively with organic compounds through a series of reactions including hydrogen abstraction electron transfer and addition gligorovski et al 2015 comparatively so4 is more preferable for electron transfer reactions and less for hydrogen abstraction or addition reactions rendering it more selective to electron rich moieties nihemaiti et al 2018 in addition cl could attack electron rich

2020 pan et al 2017 yang et al 2016 yang et al 2019 in addition miklos et al 2019 reported faster degradation of uv chlorine than uv ps and uv h2o2 toward some trace organic chemicals e g caffeine carbamazepine primidone benzotriazole etc as well as higher selectivity in uv ps and uv chlorine than uv h2o2 by contrast limited studies are available concerning the transformation of complicated dissolved organic matters dom during uv aops mediated water wastewater treatment chen et al 2017 varanasi et al 2018 wang et al 2017 reported that chromophores and fluorophores of natural organic matter nom could be effectively destroyed during uv chlorine treatment by using spectroscopic characterization in addition defom with higher molecular weight mw was more readily degraded in uv h2o2 and uv ps based on chromatographic analysis chen et al 2017 in spite of some valuable information available based on the analytical methods mentioned above it is still far from systematically exploring the molecular transformation of dom in the uv aops the development of high resolution mass spectrometry hrms provides the possibility for deciphering the molecular composition of complex dom systems varanasi et al 2018 ever investigated the transformation of nom during three uv aops treatment using orbitrap ms they revealed that aliphatic compounds underwent an evident transformation in uv h2o2 and uv chorine whereas aromatic and olefinic ones were subjected to more readily degradation in uv ps compared with orbitrap ms fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is more powerful to characterize molecular composition of complicated dom with the highest resolution and mass accuracy up to date hawkes et al 2016 marshall and chen 2015 currently increasing studies are available to employ ft icr ms to characterize the molecular composition and or transformation of nom in natural water bodies hao et al 2017 kellerman et al 2015 lavonen et al 2015 mcdonough et al 2020 osterholz et al 2015 whereas limited studies fell in the field of wastewater treatment geng et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b in a very recent study fang et al 2020 reported the transformation of dom in uv aops treatment of oil sands processing wastewater based on ft icr ms analysis and naphthenic acids o2 species were found to exhibit the highest removal in uv ps while more nitrogen containing compounds were degraded in uv chlorine these studies indicated that the performance of uv aops depended upon the dom composition and water matrix significantly however understanding the transformation of defom in municipal wastewater during uv aops treatment particularly at molecular level still remains unclear in this study we employed ft icr ms to characterize the advanced treatment of municipal secondary effluent by using three uv aops in an attempt to better understand the molecular transformation of defom the common and unique precursors and products in these processes were identified and the possible precursor product pairs were deciphered based on 24 types of typical reactions further the chlorinated byproducts cl bps were detected along with the identification of their possible precursors the acute toxicity of all the samples before and after treatments was examined and its correlation with other parameters was established we believe this study could advance the understanding of molecular transformation of defom as induced by various free radicals in real wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials secondary effluent sample was collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp in nanjing china the sample was filtered through cellulose membranes 0 45 Œºm and stored in brown glass bottles at 4 c for further

a 900 ml cylindrical borosilicate glass reactor equipped with a low pressure mercury lamp 254 nm 28 w shanghai jiguang special lighting appliance factory in a quartz sleeve the reactor was placed in a thermostatic water bath coupled with magnetic stirring to maintain the reaction temperature of 25 1 c the photon flux i 0 entering the solution was measured to be 2 72 Œºeinstein s 1 by using iodide

on the measurement of h2o2 photolysis kinetics li et al 2012 oxidants 0 50 mm h2o2 ps or free chlorine were spiked into 900 ml secondary effluent to initiate the experiments and the reaction solutions were simultaneously exposed to uv lamp for 20 min the uv lamp was preheated for at least 15 min before experiments after 20 min reaction the solutions quenched by sodium sulfite were collected to determine the concentrations of thms and haas and the non quenched solutions were sampled to measure the concentrations of the residual oxidants immediately in addition 700 ml quenched samples were used to conduct solid phase extraction spe for ft icr ms and acute toxicity analysis two spe cartridges agilent bond elut ppl 1 g 6 ml tandem merk lichrolut en 200 mg 3 ml were coupled for defom extraction with the procedures described in our recent studies zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2021 and the extraction efficiencies fell in the range of 53 2 62 2 table s2 note that the ph values of all samples were adjusted by formic acid rather than hydrochloric acid to avoid the formation of false positive cl containing compounds during spe processes gonsior et al 2015 phungsai et al 2016 sanchis et al 2020 besides the control tests of uv chlorination h2o2 or ps alone were performed under otherwise identical conditions to the corresponding uv aops due to the inappreciable changes of uv254 and the concentrations of h2o2 and ps the reaction systems of h2o2 alone and ps alone were not discussed in this study all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 general water parameters the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was determined by a toc lcsh analyzer shimadzu japan a uv 2600 spectrophotometer shimadzu japan was used to record the uv absorbance at 254 nm and the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 was calculated by normalizing uv254 to doc concentration weishaar et al 2003 other analytical methods are detailed in text s1 2 3 2 oxidants

1998 thms including trichloromethane tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm and tribromomethane tbm were detected by headspace gas chromatography gc trace 1310 isq thermo fisher scientific usa equipped with an electron capture detector ecd ristoiu et al 2009 sweetman et al 2018 the chromatographic column of tg 5ms 30 m 0 32 mm 0 25 ¬µm was used in this study with the detector

tbaa dibromoacetic acid dbaa monobromoacetic acid mbaa bromochloroacetic acid bcaa bromodichloroacetic acid bdcaa and chlorodibromoacetic acid cdbaa were measured by an ion chromatography with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with the detailed procedures described by cheng et al 2021 2 3 3 ft icr ms the dom samples were analyzed by a 15 t ft icr ms solarix bruker equipped with an electrospray ionization esi source in negative ionization mode other instrument parameters and operating conditions were consistent with our previous work zhang et al 2021 molecular formulae were assigned by matlab algorithms created by fu et al 2020a 2020b elemental composition was restricted with the combination of 12c1 60 1h1 120 16o1 50 14n0 5 32s0 3 31p0 2 35cl0 3 and only the peaks with signal to noise ratios 5 were considered during molecule assignment other restrictions of molecular composition are described in text s2 for a given formula the error between the measured mw and the theoretical one was set to 0 5 ppm and only the formulae coexisting in triplicated samples were retained to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of the detection hao et al 2017 lv et al 2018 the common formulae of each process were used to conduct further analysis for cl containing formulae the final verification was conducted by isotopic simulation according to the abundance ratio of 35cl 37cl 3 1 2 3 4 acute toxicity luminescent bacteria photobacterium t3 were resuscitated using 1 ml of 2 5 nacl in low temperature environment 4 c the 10 Œºl of bacteria solution was added into 2 ml samples diluted by 3 nacl with the concentration factor of 8 and 3 nacl solution was set for the control test weng et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a after 10 min exposure the luminosity was recorded by a biological toxicity analyzer dxy 3 nanjing institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences each sample was measured in triplicate the inhibition rate of luminescent bacteria was calculated by dividing the luminosity of sample by the control test the higher inhibition rate implies higher acute toxicity 2 4 statistical analysis to better investigate the molecular transformation of defom the compounds were classified into three categories of precursors products and resistants the classification process is detailed and illustrated in fig s1 first shapiro wilk test was used to determine the normality of the peak intensities of each coexisting formula in parallel samples seidel et al 2016 second if the peak intensities of a certain formula existing in both samples before and after treatment follow normal distribution the paired student s t test was applied to assess whether the peak intensities have changed significantly before and after treatment while the wilcoxon signed ranks test was used for abnormally distributed data sanchis et al 2020 the compounds with significant increase p value 0 05 in the peak intensity treated sample versus raw sample were considered to be products by contrast the ones with significant decline p value 0 05 in peak intensity treated sample versus raw sample were assigned as precursors all the test processes were performed in r software mathsoft version 4 0 3 the possible precursor product pairs were matched by mass difference analysis between all precursors and all products the detailed procedures are available from our recent work zhang et al 2021 the correlation analysis was performed in r software using corrgram package 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes of general properties after different treatments as shown in table 1 the doc removal was not noticeable during the treatment of uv alone chlorination and uv aops the highest doc removal of 6 95 was observed in uv ps implying the negligible mineralization ability of these systems toward defom miklos et al 2019 has also reported the similar mineralization rate 5 of trace organic chemicals in municipal wastewater during uv aops treatment under similar conditions to this study as a surrogate parameter for aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 suva254 dropped down to different extents in all the systems indicating the destruction of chromophores with conjugated double bond structures and or aromatic rings of defom notably the overall trend of the suva254 decline followed the order of uv chlorine uv ps uv h2o2 uv chlorination with the highest value of 80 93 for uv chlorine which might be related to its high radical yield li et al 2017 another important reason is possibly that cl features higher reactivity and more selectivity than ho toward electron rich compounds e g phenolic aromatic and aniline compounds pan et al 2017 in addition the ph values exhibited insignificant variation in all the systems indicating the strong buffering capacity of the test wastewater 3 2 overview of molecular composition of defom before and after treatment as shown in figs s2 s3 the molecular composition of secondary effluent mainly included cho chos and chon compounds compared with natural water chos compounds of high abundance in secondary effluent were likely to come from surfactants used in domestic detergents gonsior et al 2011 after treatments except chlorination the relative abundance of chos compounds was reduced obviously whereas an opposite trend was observed for cho compounds the similar result was observed in the transformation of defom during ozonation zhang et al 2021 implying that chos compounds might be easily destroyed and finally transformed into cho compounds during oxidation dai et al 2014 kalinski et al 2014 as expected both the number and the relative abundance of cl containing compounds increased clearly after chlorination and uv chlorine treatment figs s2c f and s3a and table s3 in viewpoint of the compound classes the highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and aliphatic compounds represented the predominant compounds of all test samples fig s3b 3 3 molecular transformation of defom in different processes 3 3 1 overview of the transformation to reflect and compare the overall changes of molecular parameters the intensity weighted averaged wa values were calculated according to the corresponding equations described elsewhere yuan et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 after treatment of three uv aops uv alone and chlorination respectively the values of h cwa o cwa and nominal oxidation state of carbon noscwa increased to some extent with the maximum increment of o cwa and noscwa observed in uv h2o2 table 1 obviously and understandably the reaction of oxygen addition is a common reaction in all the oxidation processes especially for those using ho as the main active species for instance the reaction of hydroxylation was extensively reported in uv h2o2 huang et al 2020 ja√©n gil et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 in addition the oxidation state of defom was increased after uv aops treatment which matches well with the increase of oxygen content on the contrary the molecular level parameters of double bond equivalent dbewa and modified aromaticity index aimodwa declined after treatment the maximum decrement of both parameters occurred in uv chlorine and was consistent with the observation of the reduction rate of suva254 the aforementioned results demonstrated that the unsaturated and aromatic compounds could be destroyed in the oxidation processes and rcs possessed the stronger reaction ability toward these compounds in fact hua et al 2021 have recently reported that clo played an important role in the transformation of defom with the reaction rate of 3 8 10 4 s 1 one order of magnitude higher than ho of 2 7 10 5 s 1 herein van krevelen diagrams of precursors products and resistants were employed to further characterize the molecular transformation of defom after different treatments of note is that the macromolecular compounds mw 1000 da were rarely detected on the basis of esi ft icr ms analysis possibly due to the difficult ionization or limited stability for these compounds in electrospray process these and reemtsma 2003 therefore only those of mw lower than 1000 da were discussed as illustrated in fig 1 the number of precursors and products in uv alone and chlorination was much lower than three uv aops implying that more transformation reactions arose in the latter reaction systems more specifically the number of precursors in different uv aops processes followed the order of uv chlorine uv h2o2 uv ps whereas the number of products and resistants matched a different trend of uv ps uv h2o2 uv chlorine this result once again suggested that uv chlorine possessed the highest reactivity with defom consistent with the oxygenation nature of the processes the precursors mainly featured low oxygen compounds o c 0 5 whereas the products mainly featured high oxygen ones o c 0 5 figs 1 and s4 to further explore the molecular transformation of oxygen containing compounds the distribution of o x species of precursors and products is displayed in fig s5 it clearly shows that the distribution of o x species of precursors was close to a normal distribution of one peak with o6 7 species as the most abundant ones just like that of the ozonation process zhang et al 2021 however two predominant peaks were observed for that of the products one with the abundant species of o11 12 for uv h2o2 and uv ps and the other with those of o7 8 for uv chlorine implying the weakest ability of the addition of multiple oxygen atoms for uv chlorine among three uv aops it might be ascribed to the lowest steady state concentration of ho in uv chlorine among these three processes hua et al 2021 further analysis was conducted to reveal the molecular dissimilarities of precursors and products in these reactions as shown in fig 2 a the majority of precursors overlapped among uv h2o2 uv ps and uv chlorine processes and only 258 8 29 30 1 22 and 395 11 76 precursors were exclusively unique for the three systems respectively in addition the unique precursors mainly featured h c of 1 40 2 20 and aimod of 0 0 25 for uv h2o2 while those for uv chlorine principally featured h c of 1 00 1 40 and aimod of 0 15 0 70 fig 2b c hence compounds of higher aromaticity and or unsaturated degree were more readily decomposed in uv chlorine than in uv h2o2 interestingly the number of common compounds in products significantly decreased 968 in products versus 2293 in precursors and the proportions of the unique products rose up to 25 26 23 83 and 28 89 for uv h2o2 uv ps and uv chlorine respectively fig 2d suggesting the distinct mechanisms of three uv aops exerting on the common compounds as evident from fig 2e f the unique products for uv chlorine were primarily concentrated at the range of mw 450 and c 20 whereas those of higher mw molecules were observed for uv h2o2 and uv ps it implied that the compounds of higher mw were more readily decomposed into lower ones during uv chlorine similar results were reported that the higher mw fractions of nom were degraded more rapidly than the lower ones during uv chlorine treatment wang et al 2017 moreover the values of h c of unique compounds in uv h2o2 is slightly lower than uv ps the different reactivity of three uv aops toward nom has been reported varanasi et al 2018 and the highest reactivity was observed between unsaturated compounds and so4 produced in uv ps however it is uv chlorine that was the most reactive in this study table 1 and figs 2 3 possibly arising from their different dom composition water matrix and oxidant dosage 3 3 2 chlorinated byproducts cl bps the concentration and composition of cl bps have been continuously concerned during water and wastewater treatment in consideration of their potential effect most unfavorable on the ecosystem hua et al 2021 phungsai et al 2018 2019 zhang et al 2012 first the concentrations of 13 known cl bps 4 thms and 9 haas were detected in this study from fig s6a b one can see that thms and haas in secondary effluent remained at a relatively low level 0 25 1 25 Œºg l and the processes of uv alone uv h2o2 and uv ps did not significantly increase their concentrations however chlorination and uv chlorine increased their concentrations dramatically to 45 85 106 69 Œºg l in these cl bps the dominant classes were trichloromethane dichloroacetic acid and monochloroacetic acid similar results were reported elsewhere hua et al 2021 wang et al 2017 which mainly arose from the substitution and addition reactions between chlorine free radicals and dom in addition 105 and 322 cl bps of unknown structures were identified for chlorination and uv chlorine respectively based on ft icr ms analysis fig s6c d and the excel table in si from the perspective of elemental composition the most abundant class of these unknown cl bps was chocl accounting for 68 57 and 83 95 in addition the proportions of choscl were 27 62 and 15 43 respectively a little higher than the chlorination and uv chlorine treatment of nom bulman and remucal 2020 ruan et al 2021 xiang et al 2020 this dissimilarity could be primarily attributed to the higher percentage of chos compounds in the secondary effluent of note is that the compound c12h19o8cl3 was presented throughout all the samples before and after treatment with relatively high intensity suggesting its high stability against uv aops it was further proved to be sucralose based on ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry analysis fig s7 note that sucralose is an artificial sweetener ubiquitous in water environment toth et al 2012 and it could induce glucose intolerance by altering the intestinal microbiota suez et al 2014 obviously how to achieve its efficient removal should be of concern in advanced wastewater treatment 3 4 identification of possible precursor product pairs as shown in fig 1f 711 3360 precursors and 735 2178 products were identified in different reaction systems indicating the complex transformation reactions in these processes to better understand the transformation processes in such a complex defom system mass difference analysis an effective approach to correlate the precursors and products lian et al 2020 raeke et al 2017 scholl√©e et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 was employed on the basis of 24 types of transformation reactions table s4 that have been reported in uv aops as depicted in fig 3a the oxygenation reactions occupied the absolute predominance in all the reaction systems with the highest oxygenation number for uv h2o2 which is consistent with its highest increment of o cwa table 1 the vast majority of oxygenation reactions were possibly associated with ho available in all the uv aops varanasi et al 2018 more specifically the reaction of addition of 3 oxygen atoms 3o was the most common reaction in uv h2o2 which could proceed via tri hydroxylation between ho and organic matter ja√©n gil et al 2021 however the most common reaction in uv ps and uv chlorine was di hydroxylation h2o2 note that this di hydroxylation was quite distinct to the common oxygenation reaction with an extra addition of 2 hydrogen atoms and its occurrence requires the presence of unsaturated bonds e g c c in the organic substrate pan et al 2017 yang et al 2017 in addition dealkylation e g ch2 c2h4 and c3h6 and dehydrogenation 2h were relatively common for all the uv aops in addition the reactions of chlorine addition only obviously existed in chlorination and uv chlorine where the reaction of hclo possessed the largest reaction number of 86 and 14 respectively for different compound categories e g cho chon chos and chons their possible precursor product pairs which are also based on the these transformation reactions 24 types could be revealed in fig s8 generally the total number of the reactions followed the order of cho chos chon chons and the highest number of cho compounds was consistent with their maximum proportion in defom note that chon compounds were proved to be the most reactive category during ozonation of defom due to the high reactivity between amines and ozone zhang et al 2021 in addition the number of 3o and h2o2 reactions in cho and chos compounds was comparable in uv ps and uv chlorine whereas the dominant h2o2 reaction occurred in chon and chons compounds implying that the reaction of di hydroxylation might be more likely to occur between ho and n containing compounds with unsaturated bonds moreover the reactions of deamination and denitration were mainly observed in chon compounds rather than chons compounds in such complex reaction systems each precursor and product could participate in multiple reactions lian et al 2020 scholl√©e et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 among 24 types of transformation reactions considered in this study each precursor could be associated with 1 to 12 products in three uv aops and each product could be associated with 1 to 16 precursors in three uv aops for example the precursor of c15h18o5 was involved in the formation of 6 cl bps c15h17o5cl c15h17o6cl c15h19o6cl c15h16o8cl2 c15h18o6cl2 and c15h20o7cl2 through different chlorine addition reactions fig 3b on the contrary the cl bp of c15h18o6cl2 could be transformed from 4 precursors c15h18o5 c15h16o4 c15h20o6 and c15h18o5 the distributions of all the precursors and products are presented in figs s9 s11 totally the number of possible precursor product pairs accounted for more than 73 of the number of precursors during uv aops the precursors associated with multiple reactions featured higher h c lower aimod and dbe values whereas the products associated with multiple reactions featured lower h c higher aimod and dbe values hereinto 312 possible precursor product pairs were identified for the unknown cl bps in chlorination and uv chlorine the corresponding precursors of these cl bps primarily possessed higher h c and lower o c values h c 0 80 and o c 0 55 the precursors participated in the addition reactions e g hclo h2cl2o2 and cl2o featured lower h c values than those of substitute reactions e g cl h clo h 2cl 2h and cl2o3 2h fig 4 a like the chlorination and uv chlorine treatment of nom ruan et al 2021 the precursors associated with addition reactions usually have higher aimod values than those involved in substitute reactions fig 4b implying that defom of high aromaticity tends to produce cl bps through addition reactions it also showed that the precursors involved in substitute reactions if with higher h c and lower aimod values could participate in more reactions moreover the cl bps produced by addition reactions featured lower o c and higher carbon number fig 4c d most of the cl bps involved in multiple addition reactions featured one chlorine atom while those in substitute reactions possessed two chlorine atoms in addition the cl bps and their corresponding precursors for the chos compounds had higher o c and lower aimod values fig s12 3 5 changes of acute toxicity and its correlation with other parameters the changes of acute toxicity of the effluent samples before and after treatment were evaluated by using photobacterium t3 cell epa 1995 weng et al 2018 and the results are shown in fig 5 one can see that the inhibition rates decreased for all the treatments following the order of uv chlorine uv h2o2 uv ps uv alone chlorination plewa et al 2012 reported that both the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity could be reduced during uv chlorine treatment of drinking water in addition hua et al 2021 reported that the concentrations of cl bps thms and haas increased significantly after uv chlorine treatment of municipal wastewater whereas the acute toxicity and genotoxicity decreased by 19 and 76 respectively it is very similar to this study and more than 300 unknown cl bps produced in uv chlorine generally cl bps are usually associated with potential carcinogenicity and developmental and reproductive toxicity richardson et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 thus further study is required to elucidate such discrepancy between their structure and concentration and the acute toxicity and the matrix effect of the sample vughs et al 2018 as well as the pretreatment of solid phase extraction in toxicological experiments may be considered in addition other toxicological methods such as the evaluations of chronic toxicity and cytotoxicity using zebra fish and human cells may be employed to evaluate the safety of the treated samples from different perspectives the proportion of macromolecular compounds mw 1000 da in defom is usually much lower than those with mw 1000 da wu et al 2020 in terms of toxicity the low mw fraction 1000 da in wastewater was usually regarded as the major contributor of toxicity aviani et al 2009 lv et al 2017 possibly based on the above considerations the correlation analyses between bulk parameters e g suva254 and acute toxicity and molecular formulae have been extensively reported hao et al 2018 kellerman et al 2018 maizel and remucal 2017 zito et al 2019 here the correlation analysis was also employed fig s13 shows the relationships among the acute toxicity suva254 the relative abundance of cho chos chon and chons compounds as well as the molecular level parameters as observed the acute toxicity showed significantly positive correlation with suva254 and the relative abundance of chos compounds p values 0 01 and 0 001 suggesting that the chos compounds and aromatic compounds might account for acute toxicity directly moreover the positive correlation between suva254 and aimodwa further confirmed the reliability of suva254 as a surrogate parameter for aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 4 conclusions and environmental implications most defom underwent structural transformation rather than mineralization in three uv aops with the highest mineralization rate of 6 95 only in uv ps on the basis of multiple statistical test methods the precursors were identified and featured lower o c values in uv aops whereas the products possessed higher ones uv chlorine could transform the largest number of precursors and the maximum increment of o c values was observed in uv h2o2 the three uv aops shared the majority of precursors whereas the unique products for each process were relatively high the unique precursors possessed lower h c and higher aimod values for uv chlorine than for uv h2o2 and the mw of products of uv chlorine was lower than the other two uv aops the oxygenation reactions were the most frequently detected in three uv aops in detail tri hydroxylation reaction 3o featured the largest number of precursor product pairs in uv h2o2 while di hydroxylation reaction h2o2 did in the other twos the reactions of chlorine addition were commonly observed in chlorination and uv chlorine and 351 cl bps of unknown structures were identified together with 312 of their precursor product pairs this study provided the molecular level transformation properties of defom in real matrix during three typical uv aops which may be helpful to guide the choice of appropriate uv aop process for advanced treatment of a given effluent for instance compared with uv h2o2 and uv ps uv chlorine exhibited the highest degradation of unsaturated aromatic compounds and reduction of acute toxicity in addition uv chlorine was favorable to enhance the adsorption efficiency of dom in post treatment by activated carbon xing et al 2019 yin and shang 2020 thus uv chlorine may be a potential option in advanced treatment of municipal secondary effluents especially for those containing aromatic micro pollutants however it should be further concerned in case high concentration of bromine ion is present in the effluent which may bring about the formation of brominated by products br bps of higher toxicity than their chlorinated analogues dong et al 2017 therefore the comprehensive toxicity evaluation seems necessary in these reaction systems when considered for practical
