11625,the importance of groundwater in preserving the health of water resources such as rivers lakes streams and associated vegetation is often ignored or underestimated which shows a lack of groundwater management policies therefore in order to manage and protect groundwater and groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes a complete framework is needed which is necessary for accomplishing the sustainability aim the present study utilized remote sensing based input in situ data and a gis framework for mapping and validation of gdes the weights of the input layers were assigned using experts opinions in the study area gdes are heterogeneous and the impact of groundwater overdraft on its dependent ecosystems was also assessed using long term in situ groundwater level data the results show a decreasing trend in groundwater storage many wells have dried in recent years whereas surface runoff through the natural streams is also reduced which reduces the supply of water and the need to identify new well locations the validation of gdes shows an accuracy of 73 40 through the area under the curve method further the gdes map was categorized into five classes and the moderate gdes are the dominant in the area the study shows an overall decrease in vegetation over the past two decades considering the risks of groundwater overdraft the policy implications to support the conservation of gdes within a sustainable withdrawal context have also been discussed in this work graphical abstract image 1 keywords roc groundwater exploitation groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes groundwater management policies vegetation indices data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is the primary source of drinking water for about 2 4 billion people on earth 96 percent of the world s fresh water supply comes from groundwater duran llacer et al 2022 in semi arid and arid regions groundwater is the main source of water for drinking and irrigation groundwater overuse causes environmental and hydrogeological issues like groundwater depletion geological subsidence earth fissures salty freshwater intrusion karst collapse declining spring water flow soil desiccation worsening groundwater quality and deterioration of vegetation which are some of the environmental problems that might occur dong et al 2018 groundwater overexploitation happens not just in india but also in many nations such as china the usa and others manda and klein 2015 jiao et al 2020 the groundwater withdrawal has risen due to increased human habitat and consumerism there is an increasing risk of depletion of groundwater storage in the majority of the world due to its rampant usage in recent decades huang et al 2020 coastal aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems also depend heavily on groundwater groundwater provides many rivers with their base flow in the summer and makes them perennial which is important to aquatic animals during hot weather additionally it is the only source of springs and habitats that support biodiversity in villages smith et al 2020 thus groundwater plays a key role in the ecological stability of its dependent ecosystems ecosystems that rely totally or in part on groundwater for their water supply are referred to as groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes duran llacer et al 2022 these ecosystems may be fed by subsurface water sources and may include marshes springs and rivers according to zurek et al 2015 terrestrial and aquatic systems such as rivers including riparian habitats hyporheic habitats and aquatic habitats lakes vegetation grasslands wetlands springs and coastal ecosystems make up the broad categories of gdes numerous plant and animal species that are adapted to living in and around water can be found in gdes johansen et al 2018 according to huang et al 2019 they offer crucial ecological functions such flood control water filtration and habitat for rare and endangered species however gdes may be subject to the effects of human activity such as groundwater contamination and pumping which can disrupt these delicate ecosystems by changing the flow and quality of groundwater rohde et al 2017 groundwater scarcity may endanger ecosystem services including food production biodiversity climate mitigation etc gdes offer significant economic and ecological advantages doody et al 2017 groundwater protection is at the forefront of water conservation and management practices however attention to gdes has been relatively underutilized understanding the connection between groundwater and its dependent ecosystems is crucial for bridging the gap between ecological and human water requirements additionally gdes are under stress due to human dependence on groundwater for irrigation and domestic water supply especially during the dry season and during droughts in arid and semi arid terrains duran llacer et al 2022 hence realistic strategies that provide efficient oversight to safeguard gdes under changing situations are required within the framework of current sustainable groundwater management practices since groundwater is closely linked with gdes large scale groundwater withdrawal may negatively affect riverine habitats and their environmental conditions excessive groundwater extraction has negative effects that include altering karst processes water table depletion reduction of river run off or spring flow land subsidence and the loss or extinction of flora zektser et al 2005 groundwater overdraft is a condition where the amount of water being withdrawn from an aquifer exceeds the rate at which it can be replenished ong or and long cang 2007 for example groundwater extraction in agricultural irrigation may cause a groundwater overdraft for several years before recharge can catch up overdraft can lead to reduced water availability land subsidence and increased pumping costs as well as harm to groundwater dependent ecosystems and decreased water quality nevill et al 2010 groundwater overdraft can occur when demand for water outpaces the recharge rate of the aquifer or when excessive pumping causes the water table to drop below the level of the well martínez et al 2018 to prevent groundwater overdraft sustainable management practices such as reducing water usage and improving recharge are important to ensure that groundwater resources are used in a way that maintains their health and availability for future generations gailey et al 2019 a groundwater management plan should incorporate vulnerability assessment as a general planning and decision making tool since it may serve as a foundation for commencing preventive actions which also offer direction for using groundwater resources and forecast potential overdraft impacts several studies have been carried out to map gdes and their main focus is on management conceptualization and ecohydrological relationships howard and merrifield 2010 smith et al 2020 huang et al 2020 duran llacer et al 2022 many other studies have used gis tools and remote sensing data but their field verification is always limited glanville et al 2016 koit et al 2021 several investigations have used lab methods like stable isotopes and public inventories for the same purpose howard and merrifield 2010 de la hera et al 2016 however most of the efforts have concentrated only on examining vegetative ecosystems dependent on groundwater ignoring terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems categorized as groundwater dependent rohde et al 2019 dabovic et al 2019 in the semi arid and tropical areas where the availability of water is limited identification and delineation of gdes is crucial to understand their location distribution and groundwater allocation according to chiloane et al 2022 only 0 06 of gdes based researches have used remote sensing based data to map gdes however in areas where the gdes are located there is very limited field data available hence in this work we have addressed this gap using remotely sensed data multi criteria decision making and in situ data groundwater depth to map gdes in the bundelkhand region of india in this work the gde indices were integrated with the spectral indices for better prediction of gde locations spectral indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the modified normalized difference water index mndwi the topographic wetness index twi land use and land cover lulc and other geological and meteorological factors namely rainfall geological variables and geomorphic variables were used to identify the occurrence of gdes for water surface extraction the mndwi is more accurate than the ndwi balázs et al 2018 gašparović and singh 2022 the twi illustrates the spatial pattern of soil moisture and areas of water accumulation gaurav singh and singh 2022 and the ndvi helps in vegetation health kumar et al 2018 mapping and validating the gdes utilising in situ and satellite data expert judgement and the multicriteria evaluation method were the main goals of the research identifying and describing regions that depend on groundwater for their survival and function is the goal of mapping gdes the present study is important for managing and conserving ecosystems as well as informed decisions makers about water use efficiency identification and delineation of gdes can help to prioritize conservation and management efforts and will be helpful for the development of policies and regulations that protect these valuable resources it is also helpful to map and validate the gdes using the remote sensing based input and in situ data in hard rock terrain in drought prone areas like bundelkhand india 2 study area in the indian state of uttar pradesh the district mahoba in the bundelkhand area is situated between 25 01 29 and 25 39 39 north latitude and 79 15 01 and 80 10 31 east longitude fig 1 the district comprises five towns and four administrative blocks within its 2884 km2 of land the district has 875 958 residents overall according to the 2011 india census a typical subtropical climate prevails in the area with long hot summers mild winters and substantial rainfall during the monsoon season the highest recorded monthly atmospheric temperature is 47 6 c in may and the lowest i e 8 3 c in january typically the temperature begins to rise in march and reaches its peak in may the temperature begins to drop in june and nearly settles at 36 c in august and september the relative humidity reaches its maximum point which ranges between 80 and 85 during the rainy season july to september while it is at its lowest point i e 30 during the summer of april and may the primary soil types are sandy and deep loamy over the last ten years an average of 770 mm of rain is expected there is no meteorological observatory in the mahoba district however the up irrigation department has established five rain gauge stations pandey 2002 the bundelkhand massif s rock formations are characterized by compact and fractured granite which prevents rain from percolating and storing under the surface some water can travel across weather zones and into phreatic aquifers because of secondary porosity formed by joints and fissures pant 2009 the mountainous and hard rock topography generates significant overland flow during the rainy season base flow therefore occurs in the river as a result of groundwater agriculture is the primary source of income for residents of mahoba which necessitates extensive groundwater extraction in addition to surface water for irrigation basins that catch the majority of the rainwater through runoff are swami brahmanand dam which has a storage capacity of 89 8 billion liters and arjun sagar reservoir which has a storage capacity of 16 6 billion liters the irrigation canals have a total length of around 455 km the dhasan urmil birma and arjun rivers flow through the study area these rivers and streams divide several administrative borders the bundelkhand granitic terrain includes the mahoba district this area is known for its water debt condition and faces many challenges when it comes to accessing a clean adequate water supply mahoba as the study area was selected mainly because it requires attention for the management of water resources and has potential solutions to overcome the rapid decline of groundwater storage 3 materials and methods the methodology adopted to achieve the objectives of the present research has been discussed as follows in situ field data parameter selection and computation weight estimation

precipitation 2010 2020 has been created as input to the gdes estimation the flow chart pertaining to methodology showed different steps invovled in the study fig 2 the mcdm process involved multi variant analysis based on the weight of each corresponding parameter duran llacer et al 2022 pandey et al 2022 since mcdm is based on expert judgment the selected scholars are experts who are expert in the field of surface and groundwater hydrology ecohydrology geology and geospatial technologies remote sensing and gis during the research work the contributions of researchers from diverse fields were considered and inputs were taken for the selection of weights duran llacer et al 2022 pandey et al 2022 the weight of each parameter has been assigned with reference to previous studies done in a similar environment and based on expert judgment to evaluate the significance of the weight of each parameter received from the experts and to compare weights have been normalized pandey et al 2022 the relative weights have then been established using equation 1 to provide an order depending on the significance of the geographical attributes 1 w t x σ x where the order as a function of the parameters is given by x wt is the weight based on the order and is the total of all the order values computed for each parameter 3 1 thematic maps different thematic maps under current research have been prepared using arcgis these maps as gis layers have been discussed below 3 1 1 elevation elevation layers inform the nature of the terrain in the study area it is also useful for the evaluation of the slope condition of the study area it is used for the preparation of the contour map the elevation map was derived from a srtm dem according to farr et al 2007 a worldwide research project known as the srtm has produced dem on a global scale which is open source data and used for the preparation of elevation maps the data is available in the gee library ee image usgs srtmgl1 003 and has been assessed with reference to the study region 3 1 2 lineament density it is a key feature in accelerating groundwater recharge lineaments are linear or curved features that signify fault or fracture zones which lead to increased secondary porosity and permeability nag and kundu 2016 lineaments are extracted from dem by applying the hill shade tool in arcmap a lineament map was composed using the line density tool in arcmap classification and conversion of the lineament density map into raster pixel format were carried out in order to assign weights for associating factors according to the closeness of the lineaments the ranks for each class of lineament density were given for the analysis 3 1 3 topographic wetness index twi the nature of the surface terrain is responsible for the accumulation of water which results in infiltration and groundwater recharge groundwater is closely associated with topographic wetness twi was calculated using the following equation eq 2 2 t w i ln α tan β where α upslope area and β topographic gradient at the corresponding point in the terrain twi map was prepared using dem in arcgis software 3 1 4 normalized difference water index ndwi the amount of canopy water has a significant impact on ndwi kumar et al 2018 water associated with deep rooted vegetation is a clear indication of dependency on groundwater ndwi was computed with the following equation eq 3 3 n d w i g r e e n s w i r g r e e n s w i r where green band wavelengths in the range of 495 570 nm and a portion of the spectrum with wavelengths between 1 628 and 1 652 nm is known as short wave infra red swir band 3 1 5 groundwater level groundwater level mbgl data was collected for the period 2000 2022 pre and post monsoon from wells located in different blocks of mahoba district the inverse distance weightage idw method is used when the set of points is dense to capture the spatial variation singh et al 2015 the idw interpolation method was applied for the preparation of groundwater level maps 3 1 6 drainage density drainage density aids in the assessment and comprehension of runoff and groundwater penetration yadav et al 2014 it is characterized as the sum of drainage channel lengths per area pandey et al 2022 the wasteland and grassland predominate in dry and semi arid environments when the protective impact of surrounding vegetation is outweighed by the effects of precipitation on surface erosion consequently vegetation areas are largely associated with drainages mohan et al 2015 a drainage density map of the study area was prepared using a dem and the line density tool available in arcmap software was applied to delineate the drainage density 3 1 7 lithology lithology influences the specific retention of water in aquifers and regulates soil porosity and permeability kumar et al 2018 a lithologic map of the study area was prepared in arcmap software the data pertaining to the study area has been downloaded from the geological survey of india s i e bhukosh website https bhukosh gsi gov in 3 1 8 geology geologic features such as faults joints fractures and folds are capable of transmitting and storing large quantities of groundwater pandey et al 2022 therefore dependency on groundwater is largely associated with the type of associated lithology and geological structures the research area s data was acquired through the bhukosh site which provides access to all of the geological survey of india s geoscientific database at no cost https bhukosh gsi gov in 3 1 9 normalize differential vegetation indices ndvi the ndvi a non dimensional index that can be utilized to determine the amount of vegetation present in a certain area of land it is a ratio of optical and near infrared reflectance of plant cover weier and herring 2011 szabó et al 2019 it was calculated with the following equation eq 4 n d v i n i r r e d n i r r e d where near infrared nir band ranges from 800 to 2500 nm and red band ranges around 700 nm 3 1 10 geomorphology it is one of the crucial factors that is frequently taken into account for the delineation of gdes along with different landforms river water bodies and active floodplains are thought to be the potential landforms for groundwater potential due to higher water retention and infiltration capacity which indicate a large dependency on groundwater kourgialas et al 2012 abijith et al 2020 a geomorphology map of the study area was prepared using arcmap software and data pertaining to the study area have been obtained from the bhukosh site of the geological survey of india https bhukosh gsi gov in 3 1 11 rainfall rainfall is the main source of surface run off that infiltrates into subsurface and forms the groundwater many habitats are prone to low precipitation zones resulting in increased dependency on groundwater daily precipitation data for a decade has been used to estimate the average rainfall in the study area the data pertaining to the study area was obtained from the india meteorological department pune india portal https dsp imdpune gov in the inverse distance weightage idw interpolation method available in arcgis software was used for the preparation of an average rainfall map which is also known as an isohytel map 3 1 12 land use land cover lulc groundwater is affected by the changes in lulc because it has an impact on the hydrological processes of the earth percolation infiltration and runoff and controls the groundwater quality singh et al 2010 srivastava et al 2013 rohde et al 2019 assert that lulc also offers details on the locations of wetlands vegetation and human activities a lulc map of the study region was prepared using the google earth engine gee sentinel 2a satellite data having a spatial resolution of 10 m is used from the gee data catalogue finally a supervised classification technique using the maximum likelihood algorithm was applied for the classification which is the most widely used and reliable yinga et al 2022 the confusion matrix was computed which suggest us the overall accuracy of the lulc map 4 results 4 1 thematic layers after preparation of a large number of thematic layers n 11 and classification of those layers into sub factors further weights were assigned to understand the gdes according to expert judgments the normalization matrix was applied to normalize the overall weight appendix i to perform the overlay analysis in arcgis software each layer was converted into raster pixel format the following is a discussion of the findings from the entire study 4 1 1 elevation the elevation in the study area varies from 56 m to 288 m above mean sea level msl the northeast region of the study area falls at a lower altitude however the southern region lies at an upper altitude this represents the flow of runoff and groundwater movement from the south to the northeast the study region is classified into five varying elevation zones fig 3 a experts have considered this feature as the least important for groundwater dependency 4 1 2 lineament density the lineaments are inclined towards the northeast and southwest fig 3b it is one of the crucial factors taken into account by the experts for groundwater dependency measures the research region has been classified into five lineament density zones high weight has been assigned to the high density zone and low weight was assigned to the low density zone respectively similarly dense regions have received a high ranking appendix ii 4 1 3 topographic wetness index twi the twi map of the research region has been classified into five categories lower value of the wetness index ranges from 3 42 to 6 66 while higher value ranges from 10 53 to 16 75 fig 3c high twi value received high weight and vice versa 4 1 4 normalized difference water index ndwi the ndwi of the study region varies from 0 60 to 0 37 and has been classified into five categories fig 4 d areas with low ndwi values received a low ranking and vice versa appendix ii 4 1 5 groundwater level gwl the gwl map depicts the eastern region of the research region has shallow water table while the southern and western regions have deep water tables fig 4a the map has been classified into 6 groundwater table categories from 0 to 12 mbgl and the overall accumulated weight was 7 30 the shallow water level has been assigned high weightages and the deepwater levels have been given low weightages 4 1 6 drainage density the map depicts that the drainage density in the study area varies from 0 24 to 1 42 km km2 drainage density is divided into five classes low drainage density leads to high infiltration thus more groundwater storage which eventually leads to an increase in the dependency on the groundwater level based on the expert judgement the low density area has been given high weight and the highly dense area has been given low weight for the calculation of overall dependency in the study area drainages are aligned towards the northern side fig 4b 4 1 7 lithology distinct lithological features are present in the study area the eastern region is mostly dominated by sand silt and clay and the northern region is composed of sand and silt with kankar coarse grained and porphyritic granite are present in the southern region a small portion of the southwest region constitutes the alluvium plain fig 4c which is given a high rank due to the increased dependency on groundwater in the region normalized weightages from the pairwise comparison matrix was 8 18 4 1 8 geology there are mainly two types of geological features present in the study area i e bundelkhand granitoid complex and undiff fluvial experts judgements say sources of groundwater in granitoid complex are mainly due to faults and folds therefore these features constitute less groundwater and give a low rank for groundwater dependency undiff fluvial patterns demonstrate an increased reliance on groundwater with shallow and deep aquifers the bundelkhand granitoid complex dominates the northern region of the study area while undiff fluvial are present in the southern region fig 4d 4 1 9 normalize differential vegetation index ndvi the ndvi of the study area varies from 0 34 to 0 7 indicating dense forest fig 5 a vegetation is uniformly distributed in the northern region with high vegetation indices groundwater is directly dependent on vegetation such as forests as a result high value is assigned a high rank in the mapping of groundwater dependency the normalized weight from the pairwise comparison matrix is 9 81 fig 6 4 1 10 geomorphology geomorphological features such as river water bodies and active floodplains which are thought to be the best landform for groundwater availability indicate a greater reliance in the associated features fig 5 b the highest rank is awarded to alluvial plains that were deposited beside river channels and flood plains experts assign low ranks to low dissected hills and valleys moderately pediment pediplain complexes dissected hills and valleys and rivers the normalized weight from the pairwise comparison matrix is 10 06 4 1 11 rainfall the rainfall map of the study area depicts high rainfall occurring in the southeast region and low rainfall in the northwest region fig 5c average rainfall in the study area varies from 655 to 933 mm the main source of groundwater is considered to be rainfall thus it is a very important parameter for groundwater dependency high rainfall regions contain high soil moisture and depend more on groundwater a high normalized weight 10 69 is obtained from the pairwise comparison matrix high ranks have been assigned to high rainfall zones and low ranks to low zones 4 1 12 land use and land cover lulc the lulc map of the study area has been classified into six categories to represent gdes fig 5d the forest and built up areas have been assigned a high rank as they have a high dependency on groundwater water barren lands and mines have been assigned low ranks the pairwise comparison matrix yields a high normalized weightage 11 32 indicating that it is the most influential parameter for gde mapping the agricultural land in the study area has been uniformly distributed barren land is mostly present in the southern region which indicates a low dependency on groundwater water bodies have the least dependency and are given the lowest rank 4 2 groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes the gdes of the study area have been categorized into five classes i e very low low medium high and very high very high zones are mostly found in the eastern and north eastern regions and they are associated with flat lands that experience significant groundwater surface water interaction and receive a lot of rain high zones 21 8 and very high zones 1 2 are located alongside the outer edge of the district boundary which accounts for 634 km2 and 51 km2 respectively fig 6 these two zones are associated with higher soil moisture uniform terrain and denser vegetation more than 50 1522 km2 of the study area falls under a medium groundwater dependent zone mostly located in the central region low 22 and very low 1 zones vary alongside medium zones accounting for 632 km2 and 26 km2 respectively low zones compared with medium zones are associated with higher elevations while the very low zones are made up mostly of barren lands gdes play a critical role in maintaining the health and stability of the environment groundwater is a crucial source of fresh water for human consumption agriculture and industry erostate et al 2020 gdes help recharge and maintain groundwater aquifers ensuring their long term sustainability gdes support the maintenance of biodiversity by supporting unique and diverse communities of plants animals and microorganisms many of which are threatened or endangered species humphreys 2006 wetlands and other gdes can play an important role in regulating local climate by moderating temperature and humidity and reducing the impacts of drought and extreme weather events morsy et al 2017 gdes can also help to maintain and improve water quality by filtering pollutants removing excess nutrients and supporting beneficial bacteria and other organisms that break down contaminants eamus et al 2016 gdes frequently give local populations valuable leisure possibilities as well as cultural spiritual and aesthetic qualities to preserve the long term sustainability of these priceless resources and the ecosystem services they offer it is crucial to conserve and manage gdes 4 3 groundwater overdrafts groundwater overdrafts low rainfall and less recharge pose threats to a long term decline in groundwater level usgs 2018 long term groundwater data have been analysed to estimate the groundwater overdraft eight sites were under study to understand the cause and relationship of the overdraft downward trends have been observed in each of the hydrographs a maximum decline 4 5 m was observed at the ruri kala site in the panwari block however the lowest decline was observed at the supa site in the charkhari block kabrai block two observation wells hydrograph analyses over two decadal periods revealed considerable decline 0 3 5 m in both the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods fig 7 a and b this is mainly due to poor dissipation of groundwater under phreatic conditions and significant overdrafts jaitpur block hydrograph analysis of two observation wells over a two decadal period showed a significant decline 0 4 m but these declines were observed in 2014 2015 and 2020 the hydrographs showed a rising 0 6 m trend during the post monsoon period in 2013 and 2019 fig 7c and d charkhari block two observation wells hydrograph analyses over two decadal periods revealed a little reduction 0 1 m but this decline was significantly observed during 2014 2015 and 2020 the hydrographs demonstrate a rising 0 5 m trend following the post monsoon fig 7 e and f it is caused by the flat topography pockets of substantial overburden thickness recharges brought on by canal seepage and a low overdraft panwari block groundwater level has decreased by 0 4 5 m while a small region saw barely perceptible rises both before and after the monsoon according to hydrograph analyses of two observation wells over a two decade period that showed overexploitation of groundwater in panwari block fig 7g and h this is mostly the outcome of extensive groundwater irrigation which causes overdrafts and a thick granular zone which also causes groundwater dissipation under phreatic circumstances 4 4 validation the year 2022 pre and post monsoon groundwater level depth data was used to validate the gdes plotting the roc curve s sensitivity against the true positive and true negative values of groundwater dependency and measuring its area under the curve auc revealed how well the models predict distributions tehrany et al 2013 singh et al 2022 raj et al 2022 auc of 0 indicates an uninformative model whereas auc of 1 indicates a perfect condition a total of 149 well locations were selected as true positive values and the roc curve has been plotted between true positive and true negative according to auc the gdes have an accuracy of 73 40 fig 8 the accuracy is also examined through field visits during pre monsoon and post monsoon periods the areas associated with very high zones have vegetation in good health 4 5 discussion eamus et al 2016 have applied inferential methodologies using hydrological geochemical and geomorphological indicators biotic assemblages historical documentation and remote sensing methodologies for gdes studies rapidly expanding human activities have altered the groundwater regimes of gdes resulting in the degradation of ecosystem health hence effective management of gdes and their ecosystem services requires prioritization the 8 step method for the valuation and initial prioritization of gdes was discussed by murray et al 2006 little explicit recognition of the way groundwater influences riverine biota or processes has been studied boulton and hancock 2006 alteration of groundwater inputs through extraction from riparian wells or changes in the local water table have an impact on these gde boulton and hancock 2006 mapping of gdes is useful for monitoring and managing water resources in semi arid and hard rock terrain gou et al 2015 where groundwater is the primary water resource in semi arid and hard rock terrain groundwater is the primary water resource for human consumption and the most invaluable natural resource to be used for irrigation and domestic life reddy et al 2019 as the water flows from high altitude towards low altitude therefore lower altitudes have been given a high ranking because accumulated run off infiltrates and recharges the groundwater yadav et al 2014 groundwater use by associated ecosystems at lower altitudes is a sign of their dependence more geological linear features such as fractures joints and faults suggest a higher probability for groundwater rajaveni et al 2017 these features play a crucial role in groundwater recharge as they serve as pathways for water to infiltrate the subsurface and replenish groundwater reserves yadav et al 2014 a high density of lineaments means that there are more opportunities for water to enter the subsurface leading to greater groundwater recharge murmu et al 2019 this is particularly important in arid and semi arid regions where water is scarce and understanding the lineament density can help in the management of groundwater resources the occurrence of groundwater is largely associated with lineaments representing faults and fractures associated ecosystems extract groundwater from the infiltration zones of faults and fractures the use of twi in mapping gdes helps to identify areas that may be vulnerable to changes in groundwater availability because of drought over extraction or mismanagement and to prioritize conservation efforts for these critical ecosystems the topographic wetness index twi is a hydrological index that combines the effects of slope and accumulated flow to represent the hydrological regime of a given location potential infiltration into the aquifer is influenced by the topographic condition which is represented by the twi moghaddam et al 2015 saheeh et al 2021 twi is commonly used in mapping gdes because it provides an indication of the presence and distribution of subsurface water which is essential for many ecosystems that rely on groundwater as a source of water twi values are calculated based on dem and higher twi values correspond to areas with greater subsurface water availability gaurav singh and singh 2022 the ndwi is an important method for monitoring vegetation and gdes as it provides information on water content in vegetation fontana and collischonn 2019 in such ecosystems vegetation is closely tied to groundwater and changes in groundwater availability directly affect the health of vegetation ndwi helps to identify areas of water stress in vegetation which can be an early indicator of declining groundwater levels xu et al 2022 this information is useful for managing groundwater resources protecting ecosystems and preserving biodiversity ndwi can also be used to monitor changes in lulc which can have a direct impact on gdes the ndwi has been utilized to link moisture conditions to gdes according to barron et al 2014 ndwi is very useful in mapping gdes groundwater level is an important factor for gdes as it directly affects the health and survival of the vegetation and other biota in these ecosystems kløve et al 2011a b groundwater provides a stable and reliable source of water for plants and animals even during times of drought or seasonal changes beckie 2013 when groundwater levels decline the availability of water to vegetation decreases leading to water stress and potentially resulting in the decline or death of the vegetation kath et al 2014 this in turn can have a ripple effect on the entire ecosystem including impacts on other species ecosystem processes and ecosystem services additionally changes in groundwater levels can also indicate changes in recharge and discharge patterns which can have implications for water management particularly in areas where groundwater is used for human consumption and irrigation abiye et al 2018 the shallow aquifer is more susceptible to anthropogenic pollution thakur et al 2021 drainage density is vital for gdes because it provides a measure of the amount of surface runoff that is able to percolate into the subsurface and replenish groundwater resources jothibasu and anbazhagan 2018 high drainage density indicates that there are many channels for water to move from the surface to the groundwater providing a consistent source of water for plants animals and other organisms that depend on the groundwater for survival in contrast low drainage density can lead to groundwater depletion and the degradation of ecosystems that rely on this resource it is one of the crucial factors selected for the mapping of gdes lithology or the physical and chemical composition of rock and soil is important for gdes because it influences the ability of the subsurface to store and transmit water akhtar et al 2021 different types of rock and soil have varying permeability and porosity which determine how easily water can move through the subsurface and how much water can be stored maggirwar and umrikar 2011 for example permeable sands and gravels can allow water to move easily and store large amounts of water while less permeable clays or compacted soils may limit water movement and storage understanding the lithology of an area is important for managing groundwater resources and preserving gdes as changes in lithology can impact the availability and quality of groundwater the ndvi is an important indicator for gdes because it provides information about the health and productivity of vegetation barron et al 2014 a higher ndvi value indicates a higher density of green healthy vegetation however a lower value suggests a lower density of vegetation or unhealthy vegetation gdes often rely on the presence of vegetation to maintain healthy and functional ecosystems ndvi can be used to monitor changes in vegetation health over time and detect declines in vegetation that may be related to changes in groundwater availability or quality ndvi can be used to detect and map areas of vegetation stress which can be an indicator of changes in groundwater availability or quality fu and burgher 2015 ndvi is one of the most influential factors in the mapping of gdes the ndvi map can help managers and scientists to understand the relationships between groundwater and vegetation and make informed decisions about how to manage these resources geomorphology is the study of landforms and landform evolution is important for gdes because it provides information about the physical characteristics of the land surface and subsurface that influence the availability and quality of groundwater geomorphologic features such as topography geologic structure and soil type can affect the distribution and movement of water influencing the recharge and discharge of groundwater resources rajaveni et al 2017 by understanding geomorphology scientists and resource managers can identify areas where groundwater is likely to be found and predict how groundwater resources will respond to changes in climate or land use further informed decisions about the management and protection of gdes boulton and hancock 2006 understanding geomorphology can also help to predict the potential impacts of land use changes such as urbanization or agriculture on groundwater resources and the ecosystems that depend on them wright 1984 lulc is an important factor for gdes because it can have a significant impact on groundwater recharge storage and flow patterns siddik et al 2022 changes in land use such as deforestation urbanization and conversion to agricultural land can lead to decreased infiltration and reduced recharge of groundwater aquifers resulting into lower water levels and reduced water quality kløve et al 2011a b however preserving natural land cover such as forests and wetlands can help to maintain or increase recharge and improve the health of gdes additionally lulc can influence the type and distribution of vegetation which in turn affects the quantity and quality of surface water and runoff and can have downstream impacts on groundwater resources singh et al 2015 one way to identify a gde is by looking at how much freshwater resources are present which will determine how much precipitation each year must fall on the surface to recharge an aquifer or sustain surface water flows eamus et al 2016 the other methods used the inputs of satellite and field data to map the gdes and many researchers have now applied this method for mapping the gdes the gdes mapping was performed in areas where the gdes percentage is large liu et al 2021 and many researchers have also mapped gdes where the gdes percentage is small compared to non gdes xu et al 2022 rampheri et al 2023 the present study has illustrated a different and new approach for the mapping of gdes in which geospatial technique based on multi criteria decision making mcdm was designed to map the gdes in semi arid region data from remote sensing fieldwork and specialist input expert judgment was effectively used to create the gdes map in gis this method has been shown to be highly effective and time saving mapping gdes has several advantages including improved understanding of ecosystem distribution and functioning mapping allows for a better understanding of the distribution and functioning of gdes including their size location and key species doody et al 2017 improved resource management mapping helps with the management of groundwater resources by identifying areas where they are vulnerable to overuse or degradation and can inform decisions about how best to manage those resources improved conservation efforts mapping can assist in the conservation of gdes by identifying areas of high ecological value and helping prioritize conservation efforts in those areas boulton 2005 improved water resource planning mapping can inform water resource planning by identifying areas where groundwater resources are critical to the functioning of ecosystems and helping prioritize efforts to protect and manage those resources loucks and van beek 2017 improved scientific knowledge mapping contributes to the scientific understanding of gdes providing a baseline for future research and monitoring efforts kreamer et al 2015 gdes in the northeast region of the study area range from high zones to very high zones this is closely correlated with high precipitation and shallow groundwater levels present in the same region according to the lulc map of the study area abundant wastelands are present in the central region of the area which indicates low gdes the same has been verified with the gdes map of the study area lithological features such as sand silt and clay allow water to move easily and store large amounts of water and they represent high gdes in the eastern region of the study area sand silt and clay are present for this region a high amount of gdes has been observed through the gdes map overexploitation of groundwater can be seen in the hydrographs of each block ruri kala site in the panwari block had the highest groundwater decrease 4 5 m whereas supa site in the charkhari block recorded the lowest 1 m 5 conclusion the semi arid and arid areas are water scarce regions due to low rainfall and the vegetation relies on groundwater in those regions hence the mapping and validation of these regions are very critical for this work we have applied the mcdm technique to compute weights for different thematic layers with the support of expert judgements for better mapping of gde occurrences the factors judged to be the most significant were geology rainfall land use land cover geomorphology and vegetation index twelve parameters were used in the mcdm process to delineate gdes the gde map was prepared for 2022 and water was classified into five classes very low low medium high and very high according to the auc the gdes have an accuracy of 73 40 the study revealed that barren lands are mostly present in the southern region indicating a low dependency on groundwater and forest and built up regions largely depend on groundwater more than 50 of the research area is covered by medium gde zones and 22 is covered by high zones eight sites were examined for overdrafts demonstrating that they occurred in each block of the mahoba district hydrographs from many locations have been identified with downward tendencies the panwari block s ruri kala site had the most groundwater decline 4 5 m whereas the charkhari block s supa site recorded the smallest decline this work emphasises the effectiveness of remote sensing gis and professional judgement for mapping gdes and their validation through the roc curve this innovative approach provides support for sustainable management of gdes in current climatic and habitational changes and it can also be applied to other arid and semi arid regions therefore this study provides a roadmap for sustainable development and management for planners and users of groundwater the limitations of gde s mapping are that due to its dependence on pixel by pixel analysis thematic layers have different spatial resolutions and scales multicollinearity among independent variables was not considered hence uncertainties may be introduced into the model result the gdes are more accurate in a xeric environment where rainfall limits vegetation subjectivity in judgement may arise which could be minimized by adopting different decision making methods the groundwater variables springs groundwater dependent wetlands and baseflow index were not calculated and we have also not used groundwater withdrawal environmental laws or climate change therefore the certainty of the findings may vary slightly from the actual gdes of the study area declaration of competing interest we authors declare that there is

11625,the importance of groundwater in preserving the health of water resources such as rivers lakes streams and associated vegetation is often ignored or underestimated which shows a lack of groundwater management policies therefore in order to manage and protect groundwater and groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes a complete framework is needed which is necessary for accomplishing the sustainability aim the present study utilized remote sensing based input in situ data and a gis framework for mapping and validation of gdes the weights of the input layers were assigned using experts opinions in the study area gdes are heterogeneous and the impact of groundwater overdraft on its dependent ecosystems was also assessed using long term in situ groundwater level data the results show a decreasing trend in groundwater storage many wells have dried in recent years whereas surface runoff through the natural streams is also reduced which reduces the supply of water and the need to identify new well locations the validation of gdes shows an accuracy of 73 40 through the area under the curve method further the gdes map was categorized into five classes and the moderate gdes are the dominant in the area the study shows an overall decrease in vegetation over the past two decades considering the risks of groundwater overdraft the policy implications to support the conservation of gdes within a sustainable withdrawal context have also been discussed in this work graphical abstract image 1 keywords roc groundwater exploitation groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes groundwater management policies vegetation indices data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is the primary source of drinking water for about 2 4 billion people on earth 96 percent of the world s fresh water supply comes from groundwater duran llacer et al 2022 in semi arid and arid regions groundwater is the main source of water for drinking and irrigation groundwater overuse causes environmental and hydrogeological issues like groundwater depletion geological subsidence earth fissures salty freshwater intrusion karst collapse declining spring water flow soil desiccation worsening groundwater quality and deterioration of vegetation which are some of the environmental problems that might occur dong et al 2018 groundwater overexploitation happens not just in india but also in many nations such as china the usa and others manda and klein 2015 jiao et al 2020 the groundwater withdrawal has risen due to increased human habitat and consumerism there is an increasing risk of depletion of groundwater storage in the majority of the world due to its rampant usage in recent decades huang et al 2020 coastal aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems also depend heavily on groundwater groundwater provides many rivers with their base flow in the summer and makes them perennial which is important to aquatic animals during hot weather additionally it is the only source of springs and habitats that support biodiversity in villages smith et al 2020 thus groundwater plays a key role in the ecological stability of its dependent ecosystems ecosystems that rely totally or in part on groundwater for their water supply are referred to as groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes duran llacer et al 2022 these ecosystems may be fed by subsurface water sources and may include marshes springs and rivers according to zurek et al 2015 terrestrial and aquatic systems such as rivers including riparian habitats hyporheic habitats and aquatic habitats lakes vegetation grasslands wetlands springs and coastal ecosystems make up the broad categories of gdes numerous plant and animal species that are adapted to living in and around water can be found in gdes johansen et al 2018 according to huang et al 2019 they offer crucial ecological functions such flood control water filtration and habitat for rare and endangered species however gdes may be subject to the effects of human activity such as groundwater contamination and pumping which can disrupt these delicate ecosystems by changing the flow and quality of groundwater rohde et al 2017 groundwater scarcity may endanger ecosystem services including food production biodiversity climate mitigation etc gdes offer significant economic and ecological advantages doody et al 2017 groundwater protection is at the forefront of water conservation and management practices however attention to gdes has been relatively underutilized understanding the connection between groundwater and its dependent ecosystems is crucial for bridging the gap between ecological and human water requirements additionally gdes are under stress due to human dependence on groundwater for irrigation and domestic water supply especially during the dry season and during droughts in arid and semi arid terrains duran llacer et al 2022 hence realistic strategies that provide efficient oversight to safeguard gdes under changing situations are required within the framework of current sustainable groundwater management practices since groundwater is closely linked with gdes large scale groundwater withdrawal may negatively affect riverine habitats and their environmental conditions excessive groundwater extraction has negative effects that include altering karst processes water table depletion reduction of river run off or spring flow land subsidence and the loss or extinction of flora zektser et al 2005 groundwater overdraft is a condition where the amount of water being withdrawn from an aquifer exceeds the rate at which it can be replenished ong or and long cang 2007 for example groundwater extraction in agricultural irrigation may cause a groundwater overdraft for several years before recharge can catch up overdraft can lead to reduced water availability land subsidence and increased pumping costs as well as harm to groundwater dependent ecosystems and decreased water quality nevill et al 2010 groundwater overdraft can occur when demand for water outpaces the recharge rate of the aquifer or when excessive pumping causes the water table to drop below the level of the well martínez et al 2018 to prevent groundwater overdraft sustainable management practices such as reducing water usage and improving recharge are important to ensure that groundwater resources are used in a way that maintains their health and availability for future generations gailey et al 2019 a groundwater management plan should incorporate vulnerability assessment as a general planning and decision making tool since it may serve as a foundation for commencing preventive actions which also offer direction for using groundwater resources and forecast potential overdraft impacts several studies have been carried out to map gdes and their main focus is on management conceptualization and ecohydrological relationships howard and merrifield 2010 smith et al 2020 huang et al 2020 duran llacer et al 2022 many other studies have used gis tools and remote sensing data but their field verification is always limited glanville et al 2016 koit et al 2021 several investigations have used lab methods like stable isotopes and public inventories for the same purpose howard and merrifield 2010 de la hera et al 2016 however most of the efforts have concentrated only on examining vegetative ecosystems dependent on groundwater ignoring terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems categorized as groundwater dependent rohde et al 2019 dabovic et al 2019 in the semi arid and tropical areas where the availability of water is limited identification and delineation of gdes is crucial to understand their location distribution and groundwater allocation according to chiloane et al 2022 only 0 06 of gdes based researches have used remote sensing based data to map gdes however in areas where the gdes are located there is very limited field data available hence in this work we have addressed this gap using remotely sensed data multi criteria decision making and in situ data groundwater depth to map gdes in the bundelkhand region of india in this work the gde indices were integrated with the spectral indices for better prediction of gde locations spectral indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the modified normalized difference water index mndwi the topographic wetness index twi land use and land cover lulc and other geological and meteorological factors namely rainfall geological variables and geomorphic variables were used to identify the occurrence of gdes for water surface extraction the mndwi is more accurate than the ndwi balázs et al 2018 gašparović and singh 2022 the twi illustrates the spatial pattern of soil moisture and areas of water accumulation gaurav singh and singh 2022 and the ndvi helps in vegetation health kumar et al 2018 mapping and validating the gdes utilising in situ and satellite data expert judgement and the multicriteria evaluation method were the main goals of the research identifying and describing regions that depend on groundwater for their survival and function is the goal of mapping gdes the present study is important for managing and conserving ecosystems as well as informed decisions makers about water use efficiency identification and delineation of gdes can help to prioritize conservation and management efforts and will be helpful for the development of policies and regulations that protect these valuable resources it is also helpful to map and validate the gdes using the remote sensing based input and in situ data in hard rock terrain in drought prone areas like bundelkhand india 2 study area in the indian state of uttar pradesh the district mahoba in the bundelkhand area is situated between 25 01 29 and 25 39 39 north latitude and 79 15 01 and 80 10 31 east longitude fig 1 the district comprises five towns and four administrative blocks within its 2884 km2 of land the district has 875 958 residents overall according to the 2011 india census a typical subtropical climate prevails in the area with long hot summers mild winters and substantial rainfall during the monsoon season the highest recorded monthly atmospheric temperature is 47 6 c in may and the lowest i e 8 3 c in january typically the temperature begins to rise in march and reaches its peak in may the temperature begins to drop in june and nearly settles at 36 c in august and september the relative humidity reaches its maximum point which ranges between 80 and 85 during the rainy season july to september while it is at its lowest point i e 30 during the summer of april and may the primary soil types are sandy and deep loamy over the last ten years an average of 770 mm of rain is expected there is no meteorological observatory in the mahoba district however the up irrigation department has established five rain gauge stations pandey 2002 the bundelkhand massif s rock formations are characterized by compact and fractured granite which prevents rain from percolating and storing under the surface some water can travel across weather zones and into phreatic aquifers because of secondary porosity formed by joints and fissures pant 2009 the mountainous and hard rock topography generates significant overland flow during the rainy season base flow therefore occurs in the river as a result of groundwater agriculture is the primary source of income for residents of mahoba which necessitates extensive groundwater extraction in addition to surface water for irrigation basins that catch the majority of the rainwater through runoff are swami brahmanand dam which has a storage capacity of 89 8 billion liters and arjun sagar reservoir which has a storage capacity of 16 6 billion liters the irrigation canals have a total length of around 455 km the dhasan urmil birma and arjun rivers flow through the study area these rivers and streams divide several administrative borders the bundelkhand granitic terrain includes the mahoba district this area is known for its water debt condition and faces many challenges when it comes to accessing a clean adequate water supply mahoba as the study area was selected mainly because it requires attention for the management of water resources and has potential solutions to overcome the rapid decline of groundwater storage 3 materials and methods the methodology adopted to achieve the objectives of the present research has been discussed as follows in situ field data parameter selection and computation weight estimation and normalization the multi criteria decision making mcdm process sensitivity analysis and validation are the significant steps which involved during this study fig 2 field data such as long term 2000

elevation model dem data of the shuttle radar topography mission srtm of 30 m was used to prepare elevation lineament and twi and drainage density maps google earth engine gee is a cloud computing platform which was used for geospatial analysis the gee has also been used to compute multispectral indices such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi normalized difference water index ndwi and the lulc multispectral indices and lulc have been prepared using sentinel 2 satellite data of the year march 2022 using terraclimate data and gee a map of climactic parameter the average precipitation 2010 2020 has been created as input to the gdes estimation the flow chart pertaining to methodology showed different steps invovled in the study fig 2 the mcdm process involved multi variant analysis based on the weight of each corresponding parameter duran llacer et al 2022 pandey et al 2022 since mcdm is based on expert judgment the selected scholars are experts who are expert in the field of surface and groundwater hydrology ecohydrology geology and geospatial technologies remote sensing and gis during the research work the contributions of researchers from diverse fields were considered and inputs were taken for the selection of weights duran llacer et al 2022 pandey et al 2022 the weight of each parameter has been assigned with reference to previous studies done in a similar environment and based on expert judgment to evaluate the significance of the weight of each parameter received from the experts and to compare weights have been normalized pandey et al 2022 the relative weights have then been established using equation 1 to provide an order depending on the significance of the geographical attributes 1 w t x σ x where the order as a function of the parameters is given by x wt is the weight based on the order and is the total of all the order values computed for each parameter 3 1 thematic maps different thematic maps under current research have been prepared using arcgis these maps as gis layers have been discussed below 3 1 1 elevation elevation layers inform the nature of the terrain in the study area it is also useful for the evaluation of the slope condition of the study area it is used for the preparation of the contour map the elevation map was derived from a srtm dem according to farr et al 2007 a worldwide research project known as the srtm has produced dem on a global scale which is open source data and used for the preparation of elevation maps the data is available in the gee library ee image usgs srtmgl1 003 and has been assessed with reference to the study region 3 1 2 lineament density it is a key feature in accelerating groundwater recharge lineaments are linear or curved features that signify fault or fracture zones which lead to increased secondary porosity and permeability nag and kundu 2016 lineaments are extracted from dem by applying the hill shade tool in arcmap a lineament map was composed using the line density tool in arcmap classification and conversion of the lineament density map into raster pixel format were carried out in order to assign weights for associating factors according to the closeness of the lineaments the ranks for each class of lineament density were given for the analysis 3 1 3 topographic wetness index twi the nature of the surface terrain is responsible for the accumulation of water which results in infiltration and groundwater recharge groundwater is closely associated with topographic wetness twi was calculated using the following equation eq 2 2 t w i ln α tan β where α upslope area and β topographic gradient at the corresponding point in the terrain twi map was prepared using dem in arcgis software 3 1 4 normalized difference water index ndwi the amount of canopy water has a significant impact on ndwi kumar et al 2018 water associated with deep rooted vegetation is a clear indication of dependency on groundwater ndwi was computed with the following equation eq 3 3 n d w i g r e e n s w i r g r e e n s w i r where green band wavelengths in the range of 495 570 nm and a portion of the spectrum with wavelengths between 1 628 and 1 652 nm is known as short wave infra red swir band 3 1 5 groundwater level groundwater level mbgl data was collected for the period 2000 2022 pre and post monsoon from wells located in different blocks of mahoba district the inverse distance weightage idw method is used when the set of points is dense to capture the spatial variation singh et al 2015 the idw interpolation method was applied for the preparation of groundwater level maps 3 1 6 drainage density drainage density aids in the assessment and comprehension of runoff and groundwater penetration yadav et al 2014 it is characterized as the sum of drainage channel lengths per area pandey et al 2022 the wasteland and grassland predominate in dry and semi arid environments when the protective impact of surrounding vegetation is outweighed by the effects of precipitation on surface erosion consequently vegetation areas are largely associated with drainages mohan et al 2015 a drainage density map of the study area was prepared using a dem and the line density tool available in arcmap software was applied to delineate the drainage density 3 1 7 lithology lithology influences the specific retention of water in aquifers and regulates soil porosity and permeability kumar et al 2018 a lithologic map of the study area was prepared in arcmap software the data pertaining to the study area has been downloaded from the geological survey of india s i e bhukosh website https bhukosh gsi gov in 3 1 8 geology geologic features such as faults joints fractures and folds are capable of transmitting and storing large quantities of groundwater pandey et al 2022 therefore dependency on groundwater is largely associated with the type of associated lithology and geological structures the research area s data was acquired through the bhukosh site which provides access to all of the geological survey of india s geoscientific database at no cost https bhukosh gsi gov in 3 1 9 normalize differential vegetation indices ndvi the ndvi a non dimensional index that can be utilized to determine the amount of vegetation present in a certain area of land it is a ratio of optical and near infrared reflectance of plant cover weier and herring 2011 szabó et al 2019 it was calculated with the following equation eq 4 n d v i n i r r e d n i r r e d where near infrared nir band ranges from 800 to 2500 nm and red band ranges around 700 nm 3 1 10 geomorphology it is one of the crucial factors that is frequently taken into account for the delineation of gdes along with different landforms river water bodies and active floodplains are thought to be the potential landforms for groundwater potential due to higher water retention and infiltration capacity which indicate a large dependency on groundwater kourgialas et al 2012 abijith et al 2020 a geomorphology map of the study area was prepared using arcmap software and data pertaining to the study area have been obtained from the bhukosh site of the geological survey of india https bhukosh gsi gov in 3 1 11 rainfall rainfall is the main source of surface run off that infiltrates into subsurface and forms the groundwater many habitats are prone to low precipitation zones resulting in increased dependency on groundwater daily precipitation data for a decade has been used to estimate the average rainfall in the study area the data pertaining to the study area was obtained from the india meteorological department pune india portal https dsp imdpune gov in the inverse distance weightage idw interpolation method available in arcgis software was used for the preparation of an average rainfall map which is also known as an isohytel map 3 1 12 land use land cover lulc groundwater is affected by the changes in lulc because it has an impact on the hydrological processes of the earth percolation infiltration and runoff and controls the groundwater quality singh et al 2010 srivastava et al 2013 rohde et al 2019 assert that lulc also offers details on the locations of wetlands vegetation and human activities a lulc map of the study region was prepared using the google earth engine gee sentinel 2a satellite data having a spatial resolution of 10 m is used from the gee data catalogue finally a supervised classification technique using the maximum likelihood algorithm was applied for the classification which is the most widely used and reliable yinga et al 2022 the confusion matrix was computed which suggest us the overall accuracy of the lulc map 4 results 4 1 thematic layers after preparation of a large number of thematic layers n 11 and classification of those layers into sub factors further weights were assigned to understand the gdes according to expert judgments the normalization matrix was applied to normalize the overall weight appendix i to perform the overlay analysis in arcgis software each layer was converted into raster pixel format the following is a discussion of the findings from the entire study 4 1 1 elevation the elevation in the study area varies from 56 m to 288 m above mean sea level msl the northeast region of the study area falls at a lower altitude however the southern region lies at an upper altitude this represents the flow of runoff and groundwater movement from the south to the northeast the study region is classified into five varying elevation zones fig 3 a experts have considered this feature as the least important for groundwater dependency 4 1 2 lineament density the lineaments are inclined towards the northeast and southwest fig 3b it is one of the crucial factors taken into account by the experts for groundwater dependency measures the research region has been classified into five lineament density zones high weight has been assigned to the high density zone and low weight was assigned to the low density zone respectively similarly dense regions have received a high ranking appendix ii 4 1 3 topographic wetness index twi the twi map of the research region has been classified into five categories lower value of the wetness index ranges from 3 42 to 6 66 while higher value ranges from 10 53 to 16 75 fig 3c high twi value received high weight and vice versa 4 1 4 normalized difference water index ndwi the ndwi of the study region varies from 0 60 to 0 37 and has been classified into five categories fig 4 d areas with low ndwi values received a low ranking and vice versa appendix ii 4 1 5 groundwater level gwl the gwl map depicts the eastern region of the research region has shallow water table while the southern and western regions have deep water tables fig 4a the map has been classified into 6 groundwater table categories from 0 to 12 mbgl and the overall accumulated weight was 7 30 the shallow water level has been assigned high weightages and the deepwater levels have been given low weightages 4 1 6 drainage density the map depicts that the drainage density in the study area varies from 0 24 to 1 42 km km2 drainage density is divided into five classes low drainage density leads to high infiltration thus more groundwater storage which eventually leads to an increase in the dependency on the groundwater level based on the expert judgement the low density area has been given high weight and the highly dense area has been given low weight for the calculation of overall dependency in the study area drainages are aligned towards the northern side fig 4b 4 1 7 lithology distinct lithological features are present in the study area the eastern region is mostly dominated by sand silt and clay and the northern region is composed of sand and silt with kankar coarse grained and porphyritic granite are present in the southern region a small portion of the southwest region constitutes the alluvium plain fig 4c which is given a high rank due to the increased dependency on groundwater in the region normalized weightages from the pairwise comparison matrix was 8 18 4 1 8 geology there are mainly two types of geological features present in the study area i e bundelkhand granitoid complex and undiff fluvial experts judgements say sources of groundwater in granitoid complex are mainly due to faults and folds therefore these features constitute less groundwater and give a low rank for groundwater dependency undiff fluvial patterns demonstrate an increased reliance on groundwater with shallow and deep aquifers the bundelkhand granitoid complex dominates the northern region of the study area while undiff fluvial are present in the southern region fig 4d 4 1 9 normalize differential vegetation index ndvi the ndvi of the study area varies from 0 34 to 0 7 indicating dense forest fig 5 a vegetation is uniformly distributed in the northern region with high vegetation indices groundwater is directly dependent on vegetation such as forests as a result high value is assigned a high rank in the mapping of groundwater dependency the normalized weight from the pairwise comparison matrix is 9 81 fig 6 4 1 10 geomorphology geomorphological features such as river water bodies and active floodplains which are thought to be the best landform for groundwater availability indicate a greater reliance in the associated features fig 5 b the highest rank is awarded to alluvial plains that were deposited beside river channels and flood plains experts assign low ranks to low dissected hills and valleys moderately pediment pediplain complexes dissected hills and valleys and rivers the normalized weight from the pairwise comparison matrix is 10 06 4 1 11 rainfall the rainfall map of the study area depicts high rainfall occurring in the southeast region and low rainfall in the northwest region fig 5c average rainfall in the study area varies from 655 to 933 mm the main source of groundwater is considered to be rainfall thus it is a very important parameter for groundwater dependency high rainfall regions contain high soil moisture and depend more on groundwater a high normalized weight 10 69 is obtained from the pairwise comparison matrix high ranks have been assigned to high rainfall zones and low ranks to low zones 4 1 12 land use and land cover lulc the lulc map of the study area has been classified into six categories to represent gdes fig 5d the forest and built up areas have been assigned a high rank as they have a high dependency on groundwater water barren lands and mines have been assigned low ranks the pairwise comparison matrix yields a high normalized weightage 11 32 indicating that it is the most influential parameter for gde mapping the agricultural land in the study area has been uniformly distributed barren land is mostly present in the southern region which indicates a low dependency on groundwater water bodies have the least dependency and are given the lowest rank 4 2 groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes the gdes of the study area have been categorized into five classes i e very low low medium high and very high very high zones are mostly found in the eastern and north eastern regions and they are associated with flat lands that experience significant groundwater surface water interaction and receive a lot of rain high zones 21 8 and very high zones 1 2 are located alongside the outer edge of the district boundary which accounts for 634 km2 and 51 km2 respectively fig 6 these two zones are associated with higher soil moisture uniform terrain and denser vegetation more than 50 1522 km2 of the study area falls under a medium groundwater dependent zone mostly located in the central region low 22 and very low 1 zones vary alongside medium zones accounting for 632 km2 and 26 km2 respectively low zones compared with medium zones are associated with higher elevations while the very low zones are made up mostly of barren lands gdes play a critical role in maintaining the health and stability of the environment groundwater is a crucial source of fresh water for human consumption agriculture and industry erostate et al 2020 gdes help recharge and maintain groundwater aquifers ensuring their long term sustainability gdes support the maintenance of biodiversity by supporting unique and diverse communities of plants animals and microorganisms many of which are threatened or endangered species humphreys 2006 wetlands and other gdes can play an important role in regulating local climate by moderating temperature and humidity and reducing the impacts of drought and extreme weather events morsy et al 2017 gdes can also help to maintain and improve water quality by filtering pollutants removing excess nutrients and supporting beneficial bacteria and other organisms that break down contaminants eamus et al 2016 gdes frequently give local populations valuable leisure possibilities as well as cultural spiritual and aesthetic qualities to preserve the long term sustainability of these priceless resources and the ecosystem services they offer it is crucial to conserve and manage gdes 4 3 groundwater overdrafts groundwater overdrafts low rainfall and less recharge pose threats to a long term decline in groundwater level usgs 2018 long term groundwater data have been analysed to estimate the groundwater overdraft eight sites were under study to understand the cause and relationship of the overdraft downward trends have been observed in each of the hydrographs a maximum decline 4 5 m was observed at the ruri kala site in the panwari block however the lowest decline was observed at the supa site in the charkhari block kabrai block two observation wells hydrograph analyses over two decadal periods revealed considerable decline 0 3 5 m in both the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods fig 7 a and b this is mainly due to poor dissipation of groundwater under phreatic conditions and significant overdrafts jaitpur block hydrograph analysis of two observation wells over a two decadal period showed a significant decline 0 4 m but these declines were observed in 2014 2015 and 2020 the hydrographs showed a rising 0 6 m trend during the post monsoon period in 2013 and 2019 fig 7c and d charkhari block two observation wells hydrograph analyses over two decadal periods revealed a little reduction 0 1 m but this decline was significantly observed during 2014 2015 and 2020 the hydrographs demonstrate a rising 0 5 m trend following the post monsoon fig 7 e and f it is caused by the flat topography pockets of substantial overburden thickness recharges brought on by canal seepage and a low overdraft panwari block groundwater level has decreased by 0 4 5 m while a small region saw barely perceptible rises both before and after the monsoon according to hydrograph analyses of two observation wells over a two decade period that showed overexploitation of groundwater in panwari block fig 7g and h this is mostly the outcome of extensive groundwater irrigation which causes overdrafts and a thick granular zone which also causes groundwater dissipation under phreatic circumstances 4 4 validation the year 2022 pre and post monsoon groundwater level depth data was used to validate the gdes plotting the roc curve s sensitivity against the true positive and true negative values of groundwater dependency and measuring its area under the curve auc revealed how well the models predict distributions tehrany et al 2013 singh et al 2022 raj et al 2022 auc of 0 indicates an uninformative model whereas auc of 1 indicates a perfect condition a total of 149 well locations were selected as true positive values and the roc curve has been plotted between true positive and true negative according to auc the gdes have an accuracy of 73 40 fig 8 the accuracy is also examined through field visits during pre monsoon and post monsoon periods the areas associated with very high zones have vegetation in good health 4 5 discussion eamus et al 2016 have applied inferential methodologies using hydrological geochemical and geomorphological indicators biotic assemblages historical documentation and remote sensing methodologies for gdes studies rapidly expanding human activities have altered the groundwater regimes of gdes resulting in the degradation of ecosystem health hence effective management of gdes and their ecosystem services requires prioritization the 8 step method for the valuation and initial prioritization of gdes was discussed by murray et al 2006 little explicit recognition of the way groundwater influences riverine biota or processes has been studied boulton and hancock 2006 alteration of groundwater inputs through extraction from riparian wells or changes in the local water table have an impact on these gde boulton and hancock 2006 mapping of gdes is useful for monitoring and managing water resources in semi arid and hard rock terrain gou et al 2015 where groundwater is the primary water resource in semi arid and hard rock terrain groundwater is the primary water resource for human consumption and the most invaluable natural resource to be used for irrigation and domestic life reddy et al 2019 as the water flows from high altitude towards low altitude therefore lower altitudes have been given a high ranking because accumulated run off infiltrates and recharges the groundwater yadav et al 2014 groundwater use by associated ecosystems at lower altitudes is a sign of their dependence more geological linear features such as fractures joints and faults suggest a higher probability for groundwater rajaveni et al 2017 these features play a crucial role in groundwater recharge as they serve as pathways for water to infiltrate the subsurface and replenish groundwater reserves yadav et al 2014 a high density of lineaments means that there are more opportunities for water to enter the subsurface leading to greater groundwater recharge murmu et al 2019 this is particularly important in arid and semi arid regions where water is scarce and understanding the lineament density can help in the management of groundwater resources the occurrence of groundwater is largely associated with lineaments representing faults and fractures associated ecosystems extract groundwater from the infiltration zones of faults and fractures the use of twi in mapping gdes helps to identify areas that may be vulnerable to changes in groundwater availability because of drought over extraction or mismanagement and to prioritize conservation efforts for these critical ecosystems the topographic wetness index twi is a hydrological index that combines the effects of slope and accumulated flow to represent the hydrological regime of a given location potential infiltration into the aquifer is influenced by the topographic condition which is represented by the twi moghaddam et al 2015 saheeh et al 2021 twi is commonly used in mapping gdes because it provides an indication of the presence and distribution of subsurface water which is essential for many ecosystems that rely on groundwater as a source of water twi values are calculated based on dem and higher twi values correspond to areas with greater subsurface water availability gaurav singh and singh 2022 the ndwi is an important method for monitoring vegetation and gdes as it provides information on water content in vegetation fontana and collischonn 2019 in such ecosystems vegetation is closely tied to groundwater and changes in groundwater availability directly affect the health of vegetation ndwi helps to identify areas of water stress in vegetation which can be an early indicator of declining groundwater levels xu et al 2022 this information is useful for managing groundwater resources protecting ecosystems and preserving biodiversity ndwi can also be used to monitor changes in lulc which can have a direct impact on gdes the ndwi has been utilized to link moisture conditions to gdes according to barron et al 2014 ndwi is very useful in mapping gdes groundwater level is an important factor for gdes as it directly affects the health and survival of the vegetation and other biota in these ecosystems kløve et al 2011a b groundwater provides a stable and reliable source of water for plants and animals even during times of drought or seasonal changes beckie 2013 when groundwater levels decline the availability of water to vegetation decreases leading to water stress and potentially resulting in the decline or death of the vegetation kath et al 2014 this in turn can have a ripple effect on the entire ecosystem including impacts on other species ecosystem processes and ecosystem services additionally changes in groundwater levels can also indicate changes in recharge and discharge patterns which can have implications for water management particularly in areas where groundwater is used for human consumption and irrigation abiye et al 2018 the shallow aquifer is more susceptible to anthropogenic pollution thakur et al 2021 drainage density is vital for gdes because it provides a measure of the amount of surface runoff that is able to percolate into the subsurface and replenish groundwater resources jothibasu and anbazhagan 2018 high drainage density indicates that there are many channels for water to move from the surface to the groundwater providing a consistent source of water for plants animals and other organisms that depend on the groundwater for survival in contrast low drainage density can lead to groundwater depletion and the degradation of ecosystems that rely on this resource it is one of the crucial factors selected for the mapping of gdes lithology or the physical and chemical composition of rock and soil is important for gdes because it influences the ability of the subsurface to store and transmit water akhtar et al 2021 different types of rock and soil have varying permeability and porosity which determine how easily water can move through the subsurface and how much water can be stored maggirwar and umrikar 2011 for example permeable sands and gravels can allow water to move easily and store large amounts of water while less permeable clays or compacted soils may limit water movement and storage understanding the lithology of an area is important for managing groundwater resources and preserving gdes as changes in lithology can impact the availability and quality of groundwater the ndvi is an important indicator for gdes because it provides information about the health and productivity of vegetation barron et al 2014 a higher ndvi value indicates a higher density of green healthy vegetation however a lower value suggests a lower density of vegetation or unhealthy vegetation gdes often rely on the presence of vegetation to maintain healthy and functional ecosystems ndvi can be used to monitor changes in vegetation health over time and detect declines in vegetation that may be related to changes in groundwater availability or quality ndvi can be used to detect and map areas of vegetation stress which can be an indicator of changes in groundwater availability or quality fu and burgher 2015 ndvi is one of the most influential factors in the mapping of gdes the ndvi map can help managers and scientists to understand the relationships between groundwater and vegetation and make informed decisions about how to manage these resources geomorphology is the study of landforms and landform evolution is important for gdes because it provides information about the physical characteristics of the land surface and subsurface that influence the availability and quality of groundwater geomorphologic features such as topography geologic structure and soil type can affect the distribution and movement of water influencing the recharge and discharge of groundwater resources rajaveni et al 2017 by understanding geomorphology scientists and resource managers can identify areas where groundwater is likely to be found and predict how groundwater resources will respond to changes in climate or land use further informed decisions about the management and protection of gdes boulton and hancock 2006 understanding geomorphology can also help to predict the potential impacts of land use changes such as urbanization or agriculture on groundwater resources and the ecosystems that depend on them wright 1984 lulc is an important factor for gdes because it can have a significant impact on groundwater recharge storage and flow patterns siddik et al 2022 changes in land use such as deforestation urbanization and conversion to agricultural land can lead to decreased infiltration and reduced recharge of groundwater aquifers resulting into lower water levels and reduced water quality kløve et al 2011a b however preserving natural land cover such as forests and wetlands can help to maintain or increase recharge and improve the health of gdes additionally lulc can influence the type and distribution of vegetation which in turn affects the quantity and quality of surface water and runoff and can have downstream impacts on groundwater resources singh et al 2015 one way to identify a gde is by looking at how much freshwater resources are present which will determine how much precipitation each year must fall on the surface to recharge an aquifer or sustain surface water flows eamus et al 2016 the other methods used the inputs of satellite and field data to map the gdes and many researchers have now applied this method for mapping the gdes the gdes mapping was performed in areas where the gdes percentage is large liu et al 2021 and many researchers have also mapped gdes where the gdes percentage is small compared to non gdes xu et al 2022 rampheri et al 2023 the present study has illustrated a different and new approach for the mapping of gdes in which geospatial technique based on multi criteria decision making mcdm was designed to map the gdes in semi arid region data from remote sensing fieldwork and specialist input expert judgment was effectively used to create the gdes map in gis this method has been shown to be highly effective and time saving mapping gdes has several advantages including improved understanding of ecosystem distribution and functioning mapping allows for a better understanding of the distribution and functioning of gdes including their size location and key species doody et al 2017 improved resource management mapping helps with the management of groundwater resources by identifying areas where they are vulnerable to overuse or degradation and can inform decisions about how best to manage those resources improved conservation efforts mapping can assist in the conservation of gdes by identifying areas of high ecological value and helping prioritize conservation efforts in those areas boulton 2005 improved water resource planning mapping can inform water resource planning by identifying areas where groundwater resources are critical to the functioning of ecosystems and helping prioritize efforts to protect and manage those resources loucks and van beek 2017 improved scientific knowledge mapping contributes to the scientific understanding of gdes providing a baseline for future research and monitoring efforts kreamer et al 2015 gdes in the northeast region of the study area range from high zones to very high zones this is closely correlated with high precipitation and shallow groundwater levels present in the same region according to the lulc map of the study area abundant wastelands are present in the central region of the area which indicates low gdes the same has been verified with the gdes map of the study area lithological features such as sand silt and clay allow water to move easily and store large amounts of water and they represent high gdes in the eastern region of the study area sand silt and clay are present for this region a high amount of gdes has been observed through the gdes map overexploitation of groundwater can be seen in the hydrographs of each block ruri kala site in the panwari block had the highest groundwater decrease 4 5 m whereas supa site in the charkhari block recorded the lowest 1 m 5 conclusion the semi arid and arid areas are water scarce regions due to low rainfall and the vegetation relies on groundwater in those regions hence the mapping and validation of these regions are very critical for this work we have applied the mcdm technique to compute weights for different thematic layers with the support of expert judgements for better mapping of gde occurrences the factors judged to be the most significant were geology rainfall land use land cover geomorphology and vegetation index twelve parameters were used in the mcdm process to delineate gdes the gde map was prepared for 2022 and water was classified into five classes very low low medium high and very high according to the auc the gdes have an accuracy of 73 40 the study revealed that barren lands are mostly present in the southern region indicating a low dependency on groundwater and forest and built up regions largely depend on groundwater more than 50 of the research area is covered by medium gde zones and 22 is covered by high zones eight sites were examined for overdrafts demonstrating that they occurred in each block of the mahoba district hydrographs from many locations have been identified with downward tendencies the panwari block s ruri kala site had the most groundwater decline 4 5 m whereas the charkhari block s supa site recorded the smallest decline this work emphasises the effectiveness of remote sensing gis and professional judgement for mapping gdes and their validation through the roc curve this innovative approach provides support for sustainable management of gdes in current climatic and habitational changes and it can also be applied to other arid and semi arid regions therefore this study provides a roadmap for sustainable development and management for planners and users of groundwater the limitations of gde s mapping are that due to its dependence on pixel by pixel analysis thematic layers have different spatial resolutions and scales multicollinearity among independent variables was not considered hence uncertainties may be introduced into the model result the gdes are more accurate in a xeric environment where rainfall limits vegetation subjectivity in judgement may arise which could be minimized by adopting different decision making methods the groundwater variables springs groundwater dependent wetlands and baseflow index were not calculated and we have also not used groundwater withdrawal environmental laws or climate change therefore the certainty of the findings may vary slightly from the actual gdes of the study area declaration of competing interest we authors declare that there is

11626,the paper presents a model developed collaboratively with farmers in a south indian village to visualize productive efficient and sustainable usage of groundwater this model is based on information and data collected over several years and analyzed through participatory community interactions the objective of the participatory modeling process is to trigger thinking among the community regarding the use of groundwater in a sustainable manner it is expected that a model of sustainable groundwater use would evolve if the community is able to perceive groundwater as a community resource with the system dynamics approach the community was enabled to understand the complexities in groundwater availability patterns its over exploitation and its impact and also to visualize scenarios that suit their context for sustaining their agriculture these scenarios effectively project the potential of groundwater as a critical and productive source of irrigation so as to sustain the agricultural base of the village community they also helped in visualizing the benefits of collectivizing groundwater from the existing borewells within the village boundaries the study reveals that there is a possibility for more sustainable use of groundwater in the selected village provided the community makes a viable choice to restrict the irrigated area and pool groundwater to provide protective irrigation to rainfed crops in a much larger area graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater irrigation rainfed agriculture sustainability system dynamics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is a natural resource widely accepted as a common resource but its use by farmers is often highly individualistic and unregulated resulting in unintended consequences for them in countries like india where agriculture is predominantly rainfed and based on groundwater use the implications of its over exploitation are manifold particularly on local cropping patterns and livelihoods of village communities the study village in south india which has gone from an abundance of groundwater to its over exploitation finally culminating in acute scarcity of such a precious resource is a classic example of such changes it has led to a situation where the community s primary livelihood occupation agriculture has drastically declined over the past two decades the objectives of the present study are firstly to trigger thinking among the community regarding the use of groundwater in a sustainable manner and secondly to explore the possibility of reversing that situation by helping them to analyze alternative scenarios such as providing critical irrigation for rainfed crops in a sustainable manner and adopt a scenario that is acceptable to them india is one of the biggest users of groundwater across the globe groundwater supplies irrigation to over 60 of irrigated lands in india siebert et al 2010 however it is observed that the efficient use of groundwater at individual farmer level does not result in sustainability at community level lack of proper regulation both at the community and the policy level results in unsustainable extraction of groundwater in villages across the country some initiatives to bring in such regulations at community level by civil society organizations and local ngos reddy et al 2014 to provide some immediate relief for these communities have been attempted however they were discontinued by the local communities as they did not appreciate groundwater as a public community resource but as a private resource taghilou 2022 this resulted in ineffective implementation of the policy initiatives in some states in india to regulate groundwater and stem its decline and therefore did not yield the desired results garduño et al 2009 bouchet et al 2019 puthucherril and paul 2021 the goal of the current research is to engage communities in appreciating groundwater as a public resource and ensuring its efficient and sustainable use at community level india is primarily an agricultural country and about 60 of the population in the country is dependent on agriculture in the past few decades water consumption has been on the rise due to population growth consequent increase in food demand and adoption of green revolution technologies to meet the demand with the advent of modern technology in agriculture the exploitation of groundwater has become easier and upland fields and rainfed lands were converted into irrigated lands in addition to these government subsidies and policies have promoted the rapid increase in irrigated crops which has also led to an increase in groundwater use at a much faster rate there are no restrictions on farmers in india to extract groundwater in their own lands saha and ray 2019 this has resulted in indiscriminate use of groundwater in villages that has led to a crisis where farmers had to leave agriculture ashalatha et al 2012 the village under study has seen such serious consequences of unsustainable use of groundwater on their primary livelihood large scale watershed development programs have been implemented in the country both by government and other agencies to conserve resources and to increase agricultural productivity and combat climate change especially in rainfed areas by augmenting groundwater in addition to these rural infrastructure development fund ridf 1 1 a major policy initiative for rural infrastructure development to fund infrastructure projects in states operationalized by national bank for agriculture and rural development nabard employment guarantee scheme mgnrega etc are programs being implemented on a large scale in different parts of the country with similar objectives the primary focus of these programs is to recharge groundwater which helps in partially addressing the problem of its over exploitation however this is an insufficient measure as groundwater use will increase as it gets recharged further investments by individuals for drilling new borewells to extract groundwater were relatively much higher than the investments by the government to recharge groundwater bakka reddy and ravindra 2004 hence to overcome the problem groundwater extraction itself has to be regulated and ensured that it is used in a sustainable manner symle et al 2014 bhattacharjee et al 2019 soula et al 2021 awareness generation among rural communities regarding sustainable use of groundwater has been undertaken through the collaborative efforts of a few civil society organizations and the government despite these efforts the overuse of groundwater could not be curtailed in some villages participatory water management programs were piloted where villagers established systems to monitor and regulate groundwater extraction reddy et al 2014 rangan 2016 to combat the water crisis these programs mainly focused on engaging with communities to help them understand groundwater behavior with the help of scientific knowledge and to comprehend several factors related to aquifer characteristics the focus was also on building community capacities towards the productive use of groundwater with proper protocols that included community level sharing of groundwater such initiatives were tried out in four of six different hydrological settings in india based on the lessons learnt from these initiatives the government of india started a nationwide aquifer mapping project in 2012 for better understanding of groundwater behavior they were further integrated into other mainstream programs like pradhan mantri krishi sinchayee yojana pmksy and watershed management programs rangan 2016 in addition to these experiments in the southern states of the country have successfully demonstrated the community sharing of groundwater by the interlinking of individual private borewells to protect rainfed crops in the kharif season while at the same time demonstrating sustainable use of groundwater the hindu 2010 the world bank 2010 ravindra and raina 2012 rao et al 2018 these involved getting borewell and non borewell farmers to agree on mutually beneficial norms such as restricting drilling of new borewells to protect existing borewells from drying up and using the available groundwater more productively this was achieved through extensive negotiations exposure visits and involvement of local elected representatives and government officials such a social regulation approach yielded better results than the knowledge intensive approach to increase scientific knowledge of communities regarding groundwater monitoring alternative crops etc reddy et al 2014 researchers have used the system dynamics sd method for the past few decades in a variety of fields including the complex use of groundwater this approach provides methods and tools to understand and evolve models on complex issues forrester 1997 sterman 2001 rouwette and vennix 2006 khan et al 2009 elsawah et al 2017 voinov et al 2016 it helps stakeholders to understand a complex system by identifying its key variables and their interrelationships e g cause effect relationships and feedback loops and to model these to help them analyze various solutions to their problems in a transparent manner feedback loops can be quantified and translated into model simulations to understand the complex dynamic behavior of systems over time it permits characterizing issues dynamically and longitudinally in time and space which includes creating maps and simulations for more comprehensive thinking and actions that can aid policy planning while similar approaches exist in literature sd has the advantage of being fairly simple such that it is easily understood and used by stakeholders without much mathematical background it can be used even in problems with relatively poor data it also helps stakeholders combine numerical data with expert knowledge in a relatively easy to understand manner sd modeling similar to most modeling approaches consists of 5 broad steps articulating the problem formulation of hypothesis describing the model structure and defining functions testing the model and policy design and evaluation sterman 2002a articulating problems involves defining the problem identification of variables boundaries time periods and aggregating related data sterman 2002b turner et al 2016 formulation of hypothesis involves defining variables for all the dimensions of the problem articulated and defining relations between variables the problem is conceptualized and synthesized in an endogenic manner by constructing causal loop diagrams clds and feedback loops describing the model structure and defining functions involves specifying rules equations and estimation of parameter values the functions are defined incorporating indicators used in clds the research questions are examined and model simulations are carried out to identify the possible scenarios that could influence policy in order to address the crisis elmahdi and mcfarlane 2009 describe the use of sd in the perth region of western australia to develop a decision support system dss for complex land and water use options and their combined impact on the groundwater table local people and other stakeholders used the dss to find solutions to rejuvenate groundwater in the region this process analyzed past usage and clearly examined various scenarios related to groundwater use for the next 25 years such as maximizing water recharge food security effecting changes in land and water use and achieving better economic results in less time in most of the scenarios a decline in groundwater levels was seen but the dss pointed to some possibility of improvement in recharge with changes in land use though the situation cannot be reversed entirely balali and viaggi 2015 developed a model to predict the future groundwater situation in the water stress regions of iran taking into consideration the dynamics in the pattern of groundwater availability and usage farmers behavior and various climatic and policy factors related to agriculture the study demonstrated that controls in using energy and pricing for groundwater usage have the potential to improve the groundwater situation in the region bates et al 2019 conducted a study in california to forecast changes in groundwater storage at basin level with the help of sd the model considered two subsystems groundwater and surface water to calculate the inputs and outputs depending on the parameters of each of these sub systems the groundwater behavior was predicted based on the dynamics of relation between the components of the two subsystems simulations were carried out for predicting groundwater storage in different time intervals at basin level and a simplified groundwater usage model was evolved with water management plans at basin level the sd model tested by barati et al 2019 for a region in iran suggested smart groundwater governance protocols for addressing inappropriate water management practices that resulted in groundwater depletion and low water quality this model tried to evaluate the smartness of policy interventions by taking equitability efficiency sustainability and democracy as indices to understand the short and long term impacts this paper attempts to analyze the patterns of groundwater depletion over the previous 50 years and its resultant impact on the local cropping system and dependent livelihoods of a rainfed village in andhra pradesh in south india the sd model has been utilized to focus on the complexity of the crisis for the local community in terms of 1 the absence of systems and norms for controlled withdrawal of groundwater that has resulted in its indiscriminate use and 2 emphasis on water intensive crops over the years coupled with climate variations that resulted in rainfall shortages these have led to a situation of acute scarcity of groundwater for both agriculture and domestic needs while stakeholders have detailed knowledge of these processes in their immediate surroundings they lack quantitative knowledge of their village level dynamics the sd method compensates for lack of this knowledge by using data and models from hydrogeology and other scientific methods the following research questions were the drivers that enabled the community to picture the crisis whether the groundwater extraction is less than its recharge are there any solutions possible situations the community can think of for more productive judicious conscious use of groundwater are there possibilities for allocating groundwater for rainfed crops in the critical times of dry spells that result in crop losses the study process enabled the community to visualize possible sustainable scenarios to come out of that crisis for example the area under irrigated crops can be reduced and the water saved could be used for providing critical irrigation for rainfed crops due to changing climatic conditions when there are no timely rains the rainfed crops cannot withstand water stress conditions for medium to long periods and as a result the crops may be partially or completely lost in such cases the crops require critical life saving irrigation thus the study explored possible options for the collective and sustainable use of groundwater and the potential of utilizing available groundwater to protect the rainfed crops in the village the study emphasized the need to see the groundwater as common property at community level with the aim to share it collectively and more productively by following critical and life saving crop irrigation methods and taking up options like the inter linking of existing borewells the paper is structured in the following manner section 1 covers introduction section 2 explains the material and methodology adopted to build the sd model along with stakeholders in the village section 3 describes the results of the study and section 4 discusses the implication of the results finally section 5 concludes with suggestions to put the proposed models into community action 2 material and methodology 2 1 study village the study village e palaguttapalli 13 32 26 4 n 79 03 51 8 e is located in balaji tirupati district of andhra pradesh in south india the village measures to approximately 500 ha it is a medium sized village with 240 households spread across 6 settlements the village is primarily agriculturally based with about 200 ha under cultivation the remaining area is forest reserve as per agriculture census division 2020 farmers are categorized into 4 classes considering their operational holdings marginal below 1 ha small 1 ha 2 ha semi medium 2 ha 4 ha and medium large 4 ha and above among the 240 households of the village 50 120 households belong to marginal 25 60 households belong to small 17 40 households belong to semi medium and the remaining 8 20 households belong to medium and large farmer category traditionally farms close to tanks and wells in the village were irrigated lands with the advent of borewell technology in the late 1980s early 1990s irrigated area in the village increased substantially and water intensive cropping patterns were adopted as a result the village began to thrive economically however from 2001 onwards the borewells started drying up due to overuse of groundwater since the late 1990s climate variability and frequent droughts have added to this crisis this resulted in frequent crop failures and farmers incurred losses in agriculture the farming community found it very difficult to adapt to this situation despite shifting to low water consuming crops like mangoes from 2003 onwards livelihood patterns changed as farmers started moving out of agriculture to non agricultural jobs in nearby towns in this context the present study attempts to explore with the community the possible models of productive and efficient use of water resources and to work out scenarios that reflect these benefits 2 2 methodology and tools the system dynamics sd approach is considered as an appropriate tool towards understanding various changes and related dynamics in the village under study for example sd can help in capturing interactions between various parts of a system in the form of feedback loops it helps understand the consequences of the actions of individuals with regard to utilization of groundwater 2 2 1 data collection the data for the sd approach were collected from both primary farming community and secondary sources indian meteorological department imd for rainfall data these data were both qualitative and quantitative in nature for the purpose of representing all categories of farmers a stratified sampling method was employed based on the categorization of farmers as defined in agriculture census this also helped capture the socio cultural structure of the village as most of the marginal and small farmers were from the lower socio economic strata while most of the medium and large farmers were from the upper socio economic strata a purposive sampling technique was used to identify farmers from each of these strata 6 from marginal 3 from small and 1 each from the remaining strata specific and detailed information was collected from these farmers to understand the problem in detail in terms of its variables and their inter relationships using two participatory methods key informant interviews and focus group discussions mukherjee 2002 chambers 2008 key informant interviews were in depth interviews with selected key farmers to collect detailed information and focus group discussions are small group discussions that help in in depth discussion of complex ideas such discussions help in generalizing data gathered during key informant interviews and in generating new ideas farmers with irrigation sources borewells open wells as well as those without such resources were also included in this sample from most strata medium and large farmer strata were an exception as almost all of them have irrigation sources though these sources may not be adequate for their large farms for data collection an open ended questionnaire was used data were collected on critical aspects like local crops and cropping pattern current crops changes over time the reasons for such changes irrigation sources their current status changes over time contributing factors for such changes changes in water use for agriculture rainfall changes in rainfall pattern and their implications agriculture labor labor availability and its changes over time changes in their wages present status of agriculture in terms of viability and profitability and in terms of options for improving the situation livelihoods changes over time reasons for such changes options for improvement and farmer s perspective and understanding of the crisis 2 2 2 causal loop diagram cld to avoid individual biases the data and information gathered from the sample key farmers and focus groups was subsequently presented to a larger group representing people from all strata and all settlements in the village and validated through detailed discussions the causal loop diagramming cld tool was used for this purpose as it is easily understandable to the stakeholders cld is a very common and popular tool for mind mapping in sd processes for describing the problem structure qualitatively lane 2006 yearworth and white 2013 white et al 2016 sanga and koli 2023 in an easy to understand manner it is a participatory diagramming process involving insights and opinions from a larger group to fine tune the cld in an iterative way as per sterman 2002a the clds are used to communicate the problem structure and facilitate both individual and group thinking on how something works in the real world morecroft 2015 notes that the stakeholders constructing clds find it useful to understand non linear relations and think about long term benefits instead of short term outcomes it also helps in visualizing the problem using feedback loops in a cld causal relationships between the variables are indicated with arrows with the first variable being the cause and the second variable being the effect if they are connected by an arrow with a positive sign a change in the first variable whether an increase or decrease results in a change in the second variable in the same direction and a negative sign implies a change in the opposite direction while identifying these relationships feedback loops in them are also identified these loops can be either positive i e reinforcing r or negative i e balancing b while the positive loops reinforce change whether growth or decline the negative loops result in stability for example in the cld fig 1 a reinforcing loop connects the following variables groundwater extracted water intensive crops bank balance access to credit new wells and working wells as more groundwater is extracted the extent of water intensive crops increases resulting in an increase in the bank balance which in turn increases access to credit for drilling new wells resulting in more working wells and leading to more groundwater extraction a balancing loop connects the following variables working wells groundwater extracted and groundwater level as the number of working wells increases groundwater extraction increases leading to a fall in the groundwater level in the village which in turn leads to a decrease in the number of working wells 2 2 3 stock and flow diagram sfd the cld is then translated into a stock and flow diagram sfd fig 2 and system dynamics equations for quantitative analysis the sfds are implemented and quantified using software tools which can visualize the policy options of the stakeholders and allow them to explore various options and scenarios the sfd shows the three stocks that we are interested in analyzing 1 groundwater volume 2 irrigated area and 3 bank balance and the variables that determine their inflows and outflows for example inflow recharge into the groundwater volume stock is proportional to 1 area of the village 2 annual rainfall 3 percolation percentage assuming for simplicity that the village groundwater system is closed outflow extraction is proportional to the variable water use per hectare and to the second stock irrigated area the data sources for obtaining the values of these variables are explained in table 1 the equations that govern these calculations are explained in the appendix 3 results upland areas are undulating with the farms traditionally being rainfed without irrigation facilities mohinder et al 2017 in these areas farmers created irrigation facilities in two ways 1 by creating new irrigation sources such as open wells or bore wells 2 by leveling the undulating lands though these two activities are labor intensive time consuming and require large financial resources farmers are keen to invest on such efforts as they benefit farmers by improving the crop yields oza 2007 regulations need to be put in place for exploration extraction and utilization of groundwater resources needless to say unregulated use will lead to over exploitation of this limited resource for example the absence of such norms led to an unhealthy competition for groundwater extraction as noted by kulkarni and vijay shankar 2014 the trend of who pumps out more and how quickly was clearly visible in the village such a situation reflected that sans regulation an increased number of structures and systems extracted groundwater which resembled the tragedy of commons garrett 1968 rangan 2016 too has noted that the lack of understanding of groundwater behavior and absence of relevant regulations have contributed to uncontrolled drilling and extraction in the village such trends were observed in the study village and it brought out the following aspects in this regard 3 1 costs of creating irrigated land fig 3 explains how the cost of creating an acre of irrigated land has changed over the years until the early 1990s the level of investments was mostly stable but at a higher end the effort was labor intensive and time consuming farmers estimated that to create an acre of land it would have cost them approximately rs 5 00 000 6095 usd per acre at current value the introduction of machinery and other new technologies in the 1990s resulted in the drastic decline of these investments post 2000 due to non availability of groundwater because of increase in groundwater depth and presence of hard rock without fissures at those depths it was uneconomical to invest further in borewells as a result the area under water intensive agriculture did not increase much during this decade 3 2 changes in irrigated area fig 4 explains the changes in irrigated area over the years from 1970 to 1990s there was a steady and gradual increase in the irrigated area the increase in irrigated area in the village gained momentum in the mid and late 1990s increasing from 40 acres to 100 acres by 2000 it was during this period that farmers began to consider groundwater as a reliable source of water for irrigation private money lenders realizing the potential of this approach offered loans for such investments farmers began to invest a portion of their income from agriculture to develop their land and to sink new boreholes in addition the energy costs to pump groundwater was never a burden on farmers as this was subsidized by the government due to such favorable conditions for irrigated agriculture irrigated crops steadily increased the area under irrigated crops was approximately 25 of the total agricultural area of the village during that time post 2001 once groundwater level fell to the hard rock level without fissures about 600 feet in this area table 2 several tube wells dried up suddenly even those which functioned yielded very low quantities of water hence there was a decline in the cultivation of irrigated crops and the irrigated areas too decreased suddenly prior to 1996 village tanks were used for both re charging wells and for irrigation through sluices primarily to supplement water from wells whenever large quantities of water were required such as during the initial land preparation phase for sowing paddy crops as per state government orders the sluices were closed since 1996 much against the people s wishes so that the village tanks could be used only for recharging the fast depleting groundwater reserves however this did not affect farmers with borewells as they were using water from tanks only occasionally as a supplementary source the few farmers who were managing their irrigation needs till then with shallow open wells together with tank water also sank deep tube wells 3 3 changes in usage of open wells and borewells until the mid 1980 s a single paddy crop was grown during the rainy season in irrigated areas as shown in fig 5 water usage per hectare during this period used to be 1 m ha from about 1985 with the advent of tube well technology and the availability of groundwater during winter season too farmers started growing a second paddy crop as winter crops required more water than rainy season crops water usage per hectare increased to 3 m ha from 1985 from about 1995 with increased market access and such other factors farmers started growing sugarcane a commercial crop for cash as it is an annual crop sugarcane needed water even during summer season so water usage per ha went up to 5 m ha post 2001 farmers could no longer grow sugarcane nor paddy they switched back to growing the hardier crops they were used to in the 1970s such as millets and cattle fodder from 2005 a few remaining farmers with irrigation facilities began to raise groundnut crop during the winter season as an irrigated dry crop from 2010 they were able to return to growing paddy crop during the rainy season as before 3 4 changes in water usage recharge and discharge fig 6 shows that the mismatch between recharge and discharge of groundwater in the village was significant the over exploitation of groundwater with the advent of borewell technology and pipelines for carrying water to the upland areas facilitated by subsidized electricity for pumping was responsible for the same the discharge was significantly lower than recharge until the mid 1980s later discharge gradually increased and reached its peak in 2001 3 5 possible options for sustainable use of groundwater for this study key informant interviews were conducted with 11 selected farmers in addition focus group discussions with several small groups at various locations within the village were conducted to explore sustainable ways of using groundwater during these interactions several proposals came up for discussion such as 1 since the water problem arose when the borewells were drilled beyond 200 ft it was proposed to fill the deeper portion beyond 200 feet with clay and use only the groundwater from the top 200 feet the villagers who sunk borewells recently to depths more than 200 ft did not accept this proposal as they had not received the returns yet out of their new borewells 2 some farmers proposed that the cropping pattern had to be changed permanently back to millets and cattle fodder from paddy and other irrigated crops that they had returned to since 2010 a few villagers expressed fears that these crops would not be profitable due to lower market prices and higher labor requirements some villagers responded that the labor problem was not new and was the result of seasonal migration of youth to urban areas they further noted that the issue may continue into the future despite the attempts to mechanize as not all operations could be mechanized 3 a few villagers proposed sharing water at village level presently some farmers practice water sharing with their neighbors at a small scale some expressed that this practice could be experimented in a small part of the village before scaling it to the village level however some farmers were skeptical of the profitability of using groundwater to irrigate rainfed crops the above proposals were discussed in a larger village level meeting and participatory simulations using various scenarios were conducted to help in evolving a sustainable model for use of groundwater these options included the controlled and restricted use of groundwater in 6 different contexts by focusing on restricting the irrigated area in different possible proportions percentage wise for this purpose the community assumed an average rainfall of about 500 mm given the highest and lowest rainfall over the last 50 years was about 700 mm and 350 mm respectively however they do recognise that the weather would continue to fluctuate due to climate change with long dry spells followed by long wet ones the possible options discussed and the expected results are shown in table 3 4 discussion groundwater being a scarce resource this study explores various scenarios for efficient and sustainable use of groundwater including collectivization of the same the community was able to visualize and identify two possible scenarios for adoption that would enable them to attain sustainable agriculture the net growth rate in the population of the village under study over the last few decades has been almost zero similar to what has been observed at the district level chief planning officer 2018 and this has not impacted the village economy significantly however similar to other rainfed villages in the country the study village has seen several dynamic changes over the last 50 years particularly in terms of rainfall pattern technological interventions usage of water resources and cropping pattern that have an effect on the socio economic conditions of the community 1 farmers reported cyclical rainfall every two to three years until 2000 with the average annual rainfall being 700 mm it fell to 350 mm between 2001 and 2014 which were drought years except during the year 2005 and it again rose to 500 mm since 2015 further they noted that i the village tanks overflowed in 1992 1996 and 1998 and never after that ii the tanks became almost full but did not overflow during 2000 2005 and 2015 however an aberration was observed from india meteorological department imd while the tanks overflowed in 1992 the imd data pai et al 2014 shows a rainfall of only about 666 mm this discrepancy is explained by the farmers as the distance from the nearest rain gauge being over 15 kms away it did not take into account the different micro climatic behavior from the surrounding area such discrepancies were to be expected 2 before 1990 farmers in the village had to rely heavily on their labor both to increase the irrigated area and for agricultural operations the diversity of rainfed crops and related operations demanded intensive labor which resulted in higher costs introduction of new technologies resulted in the reduced costs of increasing the cultivable irrigated area physical effort of family members was also involved in digging open wells and creating irrigation sources for their lands usually the creation or expansion of irrigated land took place in small pieces adjacent to their existing farmlands the advances in technology in the 1990s i e the availability of borewell drilling machines made it possible to chase groundwater with less effort and less money the other factors were the availability of easy credit options and the availability of pvc pipes to carry water to other areas with little human intervention these options being highly affordable led to the laying of approximately 100 kms of pipeline for purposes of drinking water and water for irrigation such factors led to a substantial increase in the irrigated area of the village 3 before the introduction of borewell technology water for irrigation in the village was limited to the lands below irrigation tanks which were owned by a few upper socio economic strata farmers lower socio economic strata farmers were disadvantaged as their farms were located in the upper reaches and were rainfed when borewell technology was introduced even in the upper reaches along with increased access to credit the groundwater use got decentralized and democratized as all sections of farmers upper and lower socio economic strata could access the groundwater by drilling borewells irrigation spread to the upland fields in addition to the lands under the tanks 4 evidently availability of extended irrigated area and new technologies had their effect on the cropping pattern until the 1970s farmers in this village cultivated millets pulses and oil seeds etc primarily for their own consumption those with large irrigated farms grew paddy for consumption and a small quantity of sugarcane and mango as cash crops for sale in the nearby agricultural markets there was a gradual shift in cropping pattern from 1980s to 2000 with availability of irrigation smaller farmers in emulating large farmers moved away from millets and started focusing on water intensive crops large farmers substantially increased the cultivation of sugarcane and mango for the market 5 apart from the availability of groundwater external factors related to green revolution also contributed to this shift this change also corroborates the findings of the ministry of rural development government of india technical committee on watershed programmes 2006 which stated that the borewells have become the largest source of irrigation in the country and their share has increased from 1 per cent in 1960 to 37 per cent by 1999 2000 introduction of energy efficient pumps and state subsidies on electricity etc also contributed to this precarious situation as noted by saha and ray 2019 before the 1960s the state government encouraged farmers to adopt well irrigation and offered electricity connections with metering in the mid 1970s however as the number of connections grew metering and billing became a logistical burden resulting in the introduction of flat rates reddy 2005 this was also an election promise by a political party in the year 1977 towards a welfare oriented policy birner et al 2011 till 1991 subsequent governments undertook electricity reforms in the state but flat tariffs for electricity for agriculture were not touched as it became a politically sensitive issue that affected the interests of farming communities mukherji et al 2009 badiani et al 2012 badiani and jessoe 2013 this led to over exploitation which was clearly visible in the study village fig 5 further it negatively affected the balance between the recharge and discharge ratios in the village fig 6 6 excess use of groundwater resources had multiple spiraling negative effects it brought down the water levels and reduced water yields from the borewells resulting in more competition among the farmers to sink deeper wells as saha and ray 2019 indicated the quantity of available groundwater was drastically reduced due to unplanned and anthropogenic interventions in the village 7 sustainability of groundwater availability is critically dependent on the balance between recharge and discharge kulkarni et al 2018 the local community hopefully can acquire a basic understanding of this balance in their aquifer system through modeling and other approaches from this understanding the community should be able to develop norms and regulations to maintain the balance between recharge and discharge absence of such norms and regulations would lead to uncontrolled over exploitation that eventually culminates in complete depletion of precious resources 8 as part of the modeling exercise the local community started exploring solutions one such solution was providing irrigation to rainfed crops such as groundnut sesame pulses and millets during dry spells in the kharif season farmers assessed the quantum of water available and the area that can be irrigated with it they also explored the possibility for collective usage of groundwater this discussion resulted in the generation of six possible scenarios for the next 20 years that included reducing the irrigated area and providing critical irrigation for rainfed crops farmers analyzed these six scenarios through their simulation using the system dynamics model and they could understand their outcomes 4 1 exploring scenarios with community for collectivization of groundwater to provide critical irrigation for rainfed crops irregular and unpredictable rainfall in low rainfall and rain shadow areas results in frequent crop losses the crop losses are severe in long dry spells as oza 2007 pointed out for a typical indian rainfed farmer irrigation itself means providing couple of support watering s as lifesaving watering to the rainfed crops during unfavorable climatic conditions and longer dry spells is crucial this is being referred to as critical irrigation in this study the ongoing research and field level experiments have established that critical irrigation can save rainfed crops and also has the potential to improve productivity sharma et al 2010 critical irrigation depends on the number of dry spells soil type and other conditions at field level in indian rainfed context different critical irrigation methods were tried out farm ponds were encouraged by crida reddy et al 2012 rao et al 2017 and mobile irrigation methods where tractor mounted water tankers with drip irrigation system and diesel engine were experimented with in ananthapur district in andhra pradesh accion fraterna 2019 however for the success of the above approach there is a need for close involvement of communities to ensure individual actions are oriented towards collective good several examples in the indian context are listed below i pani panchayat water council system for equitable distribution of water in a drought prone region in maharashtra state during the 1970s deshpande and ratna reddy 1990 ii participatory watershed method was implemented successfully in the nearby ralegan siddhi village mehta and satpathy 2008 where rainwater was conserved collectively iii revival of 5 rivers and building thousands of johads a local form of rainwater storage structure bringing water back to over 1000 villages sinha et al 2013 arghyam 2015 iv participatory watershed program of hiware bazaar village in maharashtra state became a model program that was replicated in several projects across india singh 2012 these approaches achieved success by reviving local ecology to achieve high productivity levels for the economic good of the community through a community based initiative experiments were conducted in two drought prone districts mahabubnagar telangana state and ananthapur andhra pradesh state with an objective to provide critical irrigation to rainfed crops was collectivizing individual private borewells mynews 2010 the hindu 2010 the world bank 2010 ravindra and raina 2012 reddy et al 2014 bhaduri and reddy 2015 pradhan and ranjan 2016 rao et al 2018 sharing of water was enabled through a pipeline network and agreed norms between borewell and non borewell farmers these norms and regulations were mutually beneficial to both parties as they focused on restricting the sinking of new borewells and using the available groundwater more productively with restricted hours of pumping for agreed irrigated areas despite these advantages it took a lot of effort to convince farmers which was achieved through extensive negotiations and several exposure visits finally culminating in a non judicial stamp paper agreement in the presence of their sarpanch an elected village president and local government representatives to give political and administrative backing to the norms and regulations as there was a ban imposed on irrigated crops during the kharif season as part of their group norms there was never a need to extract water continuously each borewell was rested once or twice in a week after scheduled hours of pumping this initiative supported by the world bank and state government of andhra pradesh demonstrated that there is possibility for collectivizing groundwater and the community would evolve their own norms for regulating its usage here farmers agreed on a few norms i not to sink new borewells for a specified period so as to protect the existing borewells from drying up ii no irrigated crops in kharif season iii contribution from all the farmers on annual basis for maintenance and repairs iv collective crop planning v water scheduling decided by group vi water outlet operation by a designated person this system could be viewed as treating groundwater as a common property resource as opposed to seeing it as a private property the feasibility for such collectivization has led to experiments with improvisations in different locations thomas 2017 equity issues were better addressed by the use of a social regulation approach it yielded better results for sustainable groundwater management than a knowledge intensive approach practiced elsewhere reddy et al 2014 the possibility of providing critical irrigation to rainfed crops by decreasing the existing irrigated area and diverting the water saved is the core element of this study during the exercises farmers were able to easily identify two best possible scenarios where the discharge of groundwater is less than the recharge as shown in fig 8 in one scenario the recharge was in tune with the discharge level other 3 scenarios reflected non sustainable use of groundwater as shown in fig 7 4 2 unsustainable scenarios of groundwater extraction in the study village farmers ruled out the first three scenarios fig 7 as they are not sustainable and viable options scenario 1 is business as usual i e there is no restriction on irrigated agriculture extent farmers felt that this scenario was not possible as it had led to the present crisis visualizing this scenario helped them in understanding the imbalance between the recharge and discharge groundwater and its implications scenario 2 is restricting the peak irrigated area to 50 20 ha and diverting the saved water to provide three protective irrigations to meet the irrigation requirements of 75 of the leftover area farmers tried to visualize the groundwater situation and found that this scenario is not viable with respect to groundwater usage as recharge is less than extraction in scenario 3 simulation was carried out by restricting the irrigated area to 50 of its peak 20 ha and exploring the possibility of providing critical irrigation to 50 of the leftover area farmers found that this scenario is also not possible for the same reason cited in scenario 2 4 3 sustainable scenarios of groundwater extraction in the study village fig 8 clearly shows that the discharge will be lesser than the recharge under scenarios 4 and 5 which is a positive situation for use of groundwater under the scenario 4 when the borewells are fully functional to their potential if the farmers restrict their regular irrigated area of water intensive crops to an extent of 25 10 ha it could result in a saving of groundwater which can ensure the protection of rainfed crops in 24 of total agricultural area 47 5 ha in the worst climatic conditions it can provide 3 critical irrigations to such crops to a larger area similarly in scenario 5 if the farmers decrease their irrigated area to 12 5 i e 5 ha they could save groundwater that can provide 3 critical irrigations to rainfed crops in an extent of 97 5 ha which is approximately 50 of total agricultural area farmers realized that these two scenarios are potentially possible for implementation that can sustain the groundwater extraction to safe limits in their village farmers felt that discharge should be less than recharge to leave a surplus for critical requirements in the future and hence scenario 6 where discharge is the same as recharge is not desirable in this scenario if the farmers could restrict their irrigated area to 25 10 ha they can provide two critical irrigations to nearly 100 ha which is 50 of the entire agricultural area 4 4 limitations of the study agrawal and gibson 1999 point out that a village community need not have a uniform social structure and shared values it has been noted van der voorn 2008 that for successful planning and implementation of any community centered and community led initiative various dimensions of communities socio cultural aspects such as the power distance between the sections of the community uncertainties in decision making role of traditions and social customs and gender are important and these need to be taken into account a limitation of this study is that while socio cultural structure of the village was captured using stratified sampling in identifying farmers for model building and scenario analysis the model itself has not incorporated the socio cultural aspects there are also several other related factors that need to be considered for example lejano et al 2007 underscores the need to understand social networks bond and mayers 2010 point out how trust between stakeholders though it is hard to build can help greatly in planning and in reducing implementation costs berrouet et al 2019 mentions the need for assessing social vulnerability at beneficiary level using locally relevant indicators and participatory approaches as they can influence stakeholder decisions in various ways these will need to be addressed in subsequent studies that use a participatory system dynamic approach use of various normative approaches such as the backcasting method musse et al 2018 and the participatory vision development tool van der voorn et al 2017 can also be explored in such studies 5 conclusions in this paper a methodology of applying sd modeling for sustainable groundwater use in rainfed areas in south india was presented an attempt was made to understand the complexities of groundwater utilization in the study village and develop good models for its sustainable use from the community point of view the visualization of current and future groundwater status and its related issues in the village through a modeling approach helped in convincing the stakeholders to identify causes for their present crisis and possible alternatives to revive the rainfed agriculture it also helped them to understand the problems in current practices of groundwater use and its impact people observed that the model behaved in a manner similar to the real world and were able to visualize possible scenarios based on their local conditions and factors the community clearly identified two possible scenarios that can enable them to adopt sustainable agriculture with a realization that they should definitely restrict the irrigated area so as to use the groundwater in a more productive way however some positive community action is required to translate their visualization into a reality social mobilization knowledge building assessing the technical feasibility for adaptation of visualized scenarios and mobilization of required financial investments are critical for such community action social mobilization is needed for facilitating collective decisions evolving norms and developing acceptable and enforceable regulations for water governance knowledge building involves further understanding of the groundwater behavior productive usage of groundwater through crop water balancing methods of recharging and maintaining local agricultural diversity technical assessment involves exploring the practical situation in terms of interventions that the community can consider for collectivization and sharing of groundwater and all this requires substantial financial investments and facilitating support through government or developmental agencies the local government is considering experimenting with groundwater collectivization pilots in a few villages in adjoining districts with similar agro climatic conditions following approaches are recommended for adoption while carrying out these pilots i participatory approach with key informants to identify key issues and their potential solutions as various scenarios and validate and refine them in village level meetings ii system dynamics approach to develop causal loop diagrams and carry out participatory simulation of various scenarios identified during these discussions and iii discuss the results of these scenario simulations in village level meetings and develop an action plan through consensus the lessons learnt from these pilots can be used to extend the interventions to other villages facing groundwater crises such extension will be easier if these pilots turn out to be financially viable so that private investments from farmers could address the collective use of groundwater instead of individual use groundwater is considered as a private resource by individual farmers this modeling exercise indicates the need to visualize groundwater as a common property resource cpr it also indicates the need to evolve appropriate norms for efficient usage the importance of collective decision making in sustaining agriculture and utilizing the resources in a more productive way is emphasized this modeling needs to be experimented at community level under different conditions for further validation further this model can be replicated in other rainfed areas and in villages that are heavily dependent on groundwater for agriculture this paper while applying the model has arrived at various scenarios which are context specific therefore replication would necessarily involve participatory development of the model using system dynamics approach to capture locally appropriate scenarios for sustainable usage of groundwater the methodology adopted in this paper more specifically section 2 2 1 needs to be applied to ensure successful engagement of the community declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

11626,the paper presents a model developed collaboratively with farmers in a south indian village to visualize productive efficient and sustainable usage of groundwater this model is based on information and data collected over several years and analyzed through participatory community interactions the objective of the participatory modeling process is to trigger thinking among the community regarding the use of groundwater in a sustainable manner it is expected that a model of sustainable groundwater use would evolve if the community is able to perceive groundwater as a community resource with the system dynamics approach the community was enabled to understand the complexities in groundwater availability patterns its over exploitation and its impact and also to visualize scenarios that suit their context for sustaining their agriculture these scenarios effectively project the potential of groundwater as a critical and productive source of irrigation so as to sustain the agricultural base of the village community they also helped in visualizing the benefits of collectivizing groundwater from the existing borewells within the village boundaries the study reveals that there is a possibility for more sustainable use of groundwater in the selected village provided the community makes a viable choice to restrict the irrigated area and pool groundwater to provide protective irrigation to rainfed crops in a much larger area graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater irrigation rainfed agriculture sustainability system dynamics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is a natural resource widely accepted as a common resource but its use by farmers is often highly individualistic and unregulated resulting in unintended consequences for them in countries like india where agriculture is predominantly rainfed and based on groundwater use the implications of its over exploitation are manifold particularly on local cropping patterns and livelihoods of village communities the study village in south india which has gone from an abundance of groundwater to its over exploitation finally culminating in acute scarcity of such a precious resource is a classic example of such changes it has led to a situation where the community s primary livelihood occupation agriculture has drastically declined over the past two decades the objectives of the present study are firstly to trigger thinking among the community regarding the use of groundwater in a sustainable manner and secondly to explore the possibility of reversing that situation by helping them to analyze alternative scenarios such as providing critical irrigation for rainfed crops in a sustainable manner and adopt a scenario that is acceptable to them india is one of the biggest users of groundwater across the globe groundwater supplies irrigation to over 60 of irrigated lands in india siebert et al 2010 however it is observed that the efficient use of groundwater at individual farmer level does not result in sustainability at community level lack of proper regulation both at the community and the policy level results in unsustainable extraction of groundwater in villages across the country some initiatives to bring in such regulations at community level by civil society organizations and local ngos reddy et al 2014 to provide some immediate relief for these communities have been attempted however they were discontinued by the local communities as they did not appreciate groundwater as a public community resource but as a private resource taghilou 2022 this resulted in ineffective implementation of the policy initiatives in some states in india to regulate groundwater and stem its decline and therefore did not yield the desired results garduño et al 2009 bouchet et al 2019 puthucherril and paul 2021 the goal of the current research is to engage communities in appreciating groundwater as a public resource and ensuring its efficient and sustainable use at community level india is primarily an agricultural country and about 60 of the population in the country is dependent on agriculture in the past few decades water consumption has been on the rise due to population growth consequent increase in food demand and adoption of green revolution technologies to meet the demand with the advent of modern technology in agriculture the exploitation of groundwater has become easier and upland fields and rainfed lands were converted into irrigated lands in addition to these government subsidies and policies have promoted the rapid increase in irrigated crops which has also led to an increase in groundwater use at a much faster rate there are no restrictions on farmers in india to extract groundwater in their own lands saha and ray 2019 this has resulted in indiscriminate use of groundwater in villages that has led to a crisis where farmers had to leave agriculture ashalatha et al 2012 the village under study has seen such serious consequences of unsustainable use of groundwater on their primary livelihood large scale watershed development programs have been implemented in the country both by government and other agencies to conserve resources and to increase agricultural productivity and combat climate change especially in rainfed areas by augmenting groundwater in addition to these rural infrastructure development fund ridf 1 1 a major policy initiative for rural infrastructure development to fund infrastructure projects in states operationalized by national bank for agriculture and rural development nabard employment guarantee scheme mgnrega etc are programs being implemented on a large scale in different parts of the country with similar objectives the primary focus of these programs is to recharge groundwater which helps in partially addressing the problem of its over exploitation however this is an insufficient measure as groundwater use will increase as it gets recharged further investments by individuals for drilling new borewells to extract groundwater were relatively much higher than the investments by the government to recharge groundwater bakka reddy and ravindra 2004 hence to overcome the problem groundwater extraction itself has to be regulated and ensured that it is used in a sustainable manner symle et al 2014 bhattacharjee et al 2019 soula et al 2021 awareness generation among rural communities regarding sustainable use of groundwater has been undertaken through the collaborative efforts of a few civil society organizations and the government despite these efforts the overuse of groundwater could not be curtailed in some villages participatory water management programs were piloted where villagers established systems to monitor and regulate groundwater extraction reddy et al 2014 rangan 2016 to combat the water crisis these programs mainly focused on engaging with communities to help them understand groundwater behavior with the help of scientific knowledge and to comprehend several factors related to aquifer characteristics the focus was also on building community capacities towards the productive use of groundwater with proper protocols that included community level sharing of groundwater such initiatives were tried out in four of six different hydrological settings in india based on the lessons learnt from these initiatives the government of india started a nationwide aquifer mapping project in 2012 for better understanding of groundwater behavior they were further integrated into other mainstream programs like pradhan mantri krishi sinchayee yojana pmksy and watershed management programs rangan 2016 in addition to these experiments in the southern states of the country have successfully demonstrated the community sharing of groundwater by the interlinking of individual private borewells to protect rainfed crops in the kharif season while at the same time demonstrating sustainable use of groundwater the hindu 2010 the world bank 2010 ravindra and raina 2012 rao et al 2018 these involved getting borewell and non borewell farmers to agree on mutually beneficial norms such as restricting drilling of new borewells to protect existing borewells from drying up and using the available groundwater more productively this was achieved through extensive negotiations exposure visits and involvement of local elected representatives and government officials such a social regulation approach yielded better results than the knowledge intensive approach to increase scientific knowledge of communities regarding groundwater monitoring alternative crops etc reddy et al 2014 researchers have used the system dynamics sd method for the past few decades in a variety of fields including the complex use of groundwater this approach provides methods and tools to understand and evolve models on complex issues forrester 1997 sterman 2001 rouwette and vennix 2006 khan et al 2009 elsawah et al 2017 voinov et al 2016 it helps stakeholders to understand a complex system by identifying its key variables and their interrelationships e g cause effect relationships and feedback loops and to model these to help them analyze various solutions to their problems in a transparent manner feedback loops can be quantified and translated into model simulations to understand the complex dynamic behavior of systems over time it permits characterizing issues dynamically and longitudinally in time and space which includes creating maps and simulations for more comprehensive thinking and actions that can aid policy planning while similar approaches exist in literature sd has the advantage of being fairly simple such that it is easily understood and used by stakeholders without much mathematical background it can be used even in problems with relatively poor data it also helps stakeholders combine numerical data with expert knowledge in a relatively easy to understand manner sd modeling similar to most modeling approaches consists of 5 broad steps articulating the problem formulation of hypothesis describing the model structure and defining functions testing the model and policy design and evaluation sterman 2002a articulating problems involves defining the problem identification of variables boundaries time periods and aggregating related data sterman 2002b turner et al 2016 formulation of hypothesis involves defining variables for all the dimensions of the problem articulated and defining relations between variables the problem is conceptualized and synthesized in an endogenic manner by constructing causal loop diagrams clds and feedback loops describing the model structure and defining functions involves specifying rules equations and estimation of parameter values the functions are defined incorporating indicators used in clds the research questions are examined and model simulations are carried out to identify the possible scenarios that could influence policy in order to address the crisis elmahdi and mcfarlane 2009 describe the use of sd in the perth region of western australia to develop a decision support system dss for complex land and water use options and their combined impact on the groundwater table local people and other stakeholders used the dss to find solutions to rejuvenate groundwater in the region this process analyzed past usage and clearly examined various scenarios related to groundwater use for the next 25 years such as maximizing water recharge food security effecting changes in land and water use and achieving better economic results in less time in most of the scenarios a decline in groundwater levels was seen but the dss pointed to some possibility of improvement in recharge with changes in land use though the situation cannot be reversed entirely balali and viaggi 2015 developed a model to predict the future groundwater situation in the water stress regions of iran taking into consideration the dynamics in the pattern of groundwater availability and usage farmers behavior and various climatic and policy factors related to agriculture the study demonstrated that controls in using energy and pricing for groundwater usage have the potential to improve the groundwater situation in the region bates et al 2019 conducted a study in california to forecast changes in groundwater storage at basin level with the help of sd the model considered two subsystems groundwater and surface water to calculate the inputs and outputs depending on the parameters of each of these sub systems the groundwater behavior was predicted based on the dynamics of relation between the components of the two subsystems simulations were carried out for predicting groundwater storage in different time intervals at basin level and a simplified groundwater usage model was evolved with water management plans at basin level the sd model tested by barati et al 2019 for a region in iran suggested smart groundwater governance protocols for addressing inappropriate water management practices that resulted in groundwater depletion and low water quality this model tried to evaluate the smartness of policy interventions by taking equitability efficiency sustainability and democracy as indices to understand the short and long term impacts this paper attempts to analyze the patterns of groundwater depletion over the previous 50 years and its resultant impact on the local cropping system and dependent livelihoods of a rainfed village in andhra pradesh in south india the sd model has been utilized to focus on the complexity of the crisis for the local community in terms of 1 the absence of systems and norms for controlled withdrawal of groundwater that has resulted in its indiscriminate use and 2 emphasis on water intensive crops over the years coupled with climate variations that resulted in rainfall shortages these have led to a situation of acute scarcity of groundwater for both agriculture and domestic needs while stakeholders have detailed knowledge of these processes in their immediate surroundings they lack quantitative knowledge of their village level dynamics the sd method compensates for lack of this knowledge by using data and models from hydrogeology and other scientific methods the following research questions were the drivers that enabled the community to picture the crisis whether the groundwater extraction is less than its recharge are there any solutions possible situations the community can think of for more productive judicious conscious use of groundwater are there possibilities for allocating groundwater for rainfed crops in the critical times of dry spells that result in crop losses the study process enabled the community to visualize possible sustainable scenarios to come out of that crisis for example the area under irrigated crops can be reduced and the water saved could be used for providing critical irrigation for rainfed crops due to changing climatic conditions when there are no timely rains the rainfed crops cannot withstand water stress conditions for medium to long periods and as a result the crops may be partially or completely lost in such cases the crops require critical life saving irrigation thus the study explored possible options for the collective and sustainable use of groundwater and the potential of utilizing available groundwater to protect the rainfed crops in the village the study emphasized the need to see the groundwater as common property at community level with the aim to share it collectively and more productively by following critical and life saving crop irrigation methods and taking up options like the inter linking of existing borewells the paper is structured in the following manner section 1 covers introduction section 2 explains the material and methodology adopted to build the sd model along with stakeholders in the village section 3 describes the results of the study and section 4 discusses the implication of the results finally section 5 concludes with suggestions to put the proposed models into community action 2 material and methodology 2 1 study village the study village e palaguttapalli 13 32 26 4 n 79 03 51 8 e is located in balaji tirupati district of andhra pradesh in south india the village measures to approximately 500 ha it is a medium sized village with 240 households spread across 6 settlements the village is primarily agriculturally based with about 200 ha under cultivation the remaining area is forest reserve as per agriculture census division 2020 farmers are categorized into 4 classes considering their operational holdings marginal below 1 ha small 1 ha 2 ha semi medium 2 ha 4 ha and medium large 4 ha and above among the 240 households of the village 50 120 households belong to marginal 25 60 households belong to small 17 40 households belong to semi medium and the remaining 8 20 households belong to medium and large farmer category traditionally farms close to tanks and wells in the village were irrigated lands with the advent of borewell technology in the late 1980s early 1990s irrigated area in the village increased substantially and water intensive cropping patterns were adopted as a result the village began to thrive economically however from 2001 onwards the borewells started drying up due to overuse of groundwater since the late 1990s climate variability and frequent droughts have added to this crisis this resulted in frequent crop failures and farmers incurred losses in agriculture the farming community found it very difficult to adapt to this situation despite shifting to low water consuming crops like mangoes from 2003 onwards livelihood patterns changed as farmers started moving out of agriculture to non agricultural jobs in nearby towns in this context the present study attempts to explore with the community the possible models of productive and efficient use of water resources and to work out scenarios that reflect these benefits 2 2 methodology and tools the system dynamics sd approach is considered as an appropriate tool towards understanding various changes and related dynamics in the village under study for example sd can help in capturing interactions between various parts of a system in the form of feedback loops it helps understand the consequences of the actions of individuals with regard to utilization of groundwater 2 2 1 data collection the data for the sd approach were collected from both primary farming community and secondary sources indian meteorological department imd for rainfall data these data were both qualitative and quantitative in nature for the purpose of representing all categories of farmers a stratified sampling method was employed based on the categorization of farmers as defined in agriculture census this also helped capture the socio cultural structure of the village as most of the marginal and small farmers were from the lower socio economic strata while most of the medium and large farmers were from the upper socio economic strata a purposive sampling technique was used to identify farmers from each of these strata 6 from marginal 3 from small and 1 each from the remaining strata specific and detailed information was collected from these farmers to understand the problem in detail in terms of its variables and their inter relationships using two participatory methods key informant interviews and focus group discussions mukherjee 2002 chambers 2008 key informant interviews were in depth interviews with selected key farmers to collect detailed information and focus group discussions are small group discussions that help in in depth discussion of complex ideas such discussions help in generalizing data gathered during key informant interviews and in generating new ideas farmers with irrigation sources borewells open wells as well as those without such resources were also included in this sample from most strata medium and large farmer strata were an exception as almost all of them have irrigation sources though these sources may not be adequate for their large farms for data collection an open ended questionnaire was used data were collected on critical aspects like local crops and cropping pattern current crops changes over time the reasons for such changes irrigation sources their current status changes over time contributing factors for such changes changes in water use for agriculture rainfall changes in rainfall pattern and their implications agriculture labor labor availability and its changes over time changes in their wages present status of agriculture in terms of viability and profitability and in terms of options for improving the situation livelihoods changes over time reasons for such changes options for improvement and farmer s perspective and understanding of the crisis 2 2 2 causal loop diagram cld to avoid individual biases the data and information gathered from the sample key farmers and focus groups was subsequently presented to a larger group representing people from all strata and all settlements in the village and validated through detailed discussions the causal loop diagramming cld tool was used for this purpose as it is easily understandable to the stakeholders cld is a very common and popular tool for mind mapping in sd processes for describing the problem structure qualitatively lane 2006 yearworth and white 2013 white et al 2016 sanga and koli 2023 in an easy to understand manner it is a participatory diagramming process involving insights and opinions from a larger group to fine tune the cld in an iterative way as per sterman 2002a the clds are used to communicate the problem structure and facilitate both individual and group thinking on how something works in the real world morecroft 2015 notes that the stakeholders constructing clds find it useful to understand non linear relations and think about long term benefits instead of short term outcomes it also helps in visualizing the problem using feedback loops in a cld causal relationships between the variables are indicated with arrows with the first variable being the cause and the second variable being the effect if they are connected by an arrow with a positive sign a change in the first variable whether an increase or decrease results in a change in the second variable in the same direction and a negative sign implies a change in the opposite direction while identifying these relationships feedback loops in them are also identified these loops can be either positive i e reinforcing r or negative i e balancing b while the positive loops reinforce change whether growth or decline the negative loops result in stability for example in the cld fig 1 a reinforcing loop connects the following variables groundwater extracted water intensive crops bank balance access to credit new wells and working wells as more groundwater is extracted the extent of water intensive crops increases resulting in an increase in the bank balance which in turn increases access to credit for drilling new wells resulting in more working wells and leading to more groundwater extraction a balancing loop connects the following variables working wells groundwater extracted and groundwater level as the number of working wells increases groundwater extraction increases leading to a fall in the groundwater level in the village which in turn leads to a decrease in the number of working wells 2 2 3 stock and flow diagram sfd the cld is then translated into a stock and flow diagram sfd fig 2 and system dynamics equations for quantitative analysis the sfds are implemented and quantified using software tools which can visualize the policy options of the stakeholders and allow them to explore various options and scenarios the sfd shows the three stocks that we are interested in analyzing 1 groundwater volume 2 irrigated area and 3 bank balance and the variables that determine their inflows and outflows for example inflow recharge into the groundwater volume stock is proportional to 1 area of the village 2 annual rainfall 3 percolation percentage assuming for simplicity that the village groundwater system is closed outflow extraction is proportional to the variable water use per hectare and to the second stock irrigated area the data sources for obtaining the values of these variables are explained in table 1 the equations that govern these calculations are explained in the appendix 3 results upland areas are undulating with the farms traditionally being rainfed without irrigation facilities mohinder et al 2017 in these areas farmers created irrigation facilities in two ways 1 by creating new irrigation sources such as open wells or bore wells 2 by leveling the undulating lands though these two activities are labor intensive time consuming and require large financial resources farmers are keen to invest on such efforts as they benefit farmers by improving the crop yields oza 2007 regulations need to be put in place for exploration extraction and utilization of groundwater resources needless to say unregulated use will lead to over exploitation of this limited resource for example the absence of such norms led to an unhealthy competition for groundwater extraction as noted by kulkarni and vijay shankar 2014 the trend of who pumps out more and how quickly was clearly visible in the village such a situation reflected that sans regulation an increased number of structures and systems extracted groundwater which resembled the tragedy of commons garrett 1968 rangan 2016 too has noted that the lack of understanding of groundwater behavior and absence of relevant regulations have contributed to uncontrolled drilling and extraction in the village such trends were observed in the study village and it brought out the following aspects in this regard 3 1 costs of creating irrigated land fig 3 explains how the cost of creating an acre of irrigated land has changed over the years until the early 1990s the level of investments was mostly stable but at a higher end the effort was labor intensive and time consuming farmers estimated that to create an acre of land it would have cost them approximately rs 5 00 000 6095 usd per acre at current value the introduction of machinery and other new technologies in the 1990s resulted in the drastic decline of these investments post 2000 due to non availability of groundwater because of increase in groundwater depth and presence of hard rock without fissures at those depths it was uneconomical to invest further in borewells as a result the area under water intensive agriculture did not increase much during this decade 3 2 changes in irrigated area fig 4 explains the changes in irrigated area over the years from 1970 to 1990s there was a steady and gradual increase in the irrigated area the increase in irrigated area in the village gained momentum in the mid and late 1990s increasing from 40 acres to 100 acres by 2000 it was during this period that farmers began to consider groundwater as a reliable source of water for irrigation private money lenders realizing the potential of this approach offered loans for such investments farmers began to invest a portion of their income from agriculture to develop their land and to sink new boreholes in addition the energy costs to pump groundwater was never a burden on farmers as this was subsidized by the government due to such favorable conditions for irrigated agriculture irrigated crops steadily increased the area under irrigated crops was approximately 25 of the total agricultural area of the village during that time post 2001 once groundwater level fell to the hard rock level without fissures about 600 feet in this area table 2 several tube wells dried up suddenly even those which functioned yielded very low quantities of water hence there was a decline in the cultivation of irrigated crops and the irrigated areas too decreased suddenly prior to 1996 village tanks were used for both re charging wells and for irrigation through sluices primarily to supplement water from wells whenever large quantities of water were required such as during the initial land preparation phase for sowing paddy crops as per state government orders the sluices were closed since 1996 much against the people s wishes so that the village tanks could be used only for recharging the fast depleting groundwater reserves however this did not affect farmers with borewells as they were using water from tanks only occasionally as a supplementary source the few farmers who were managing their irrigation needs till then with shallow open wells together with tank water also sank deep tube wells 3 3 changes in usage of open wells and borewells until the mid 1980 s a single paddy crop was grown during the rainy season in irrigated areas as shown in fig 5 water usage per hectare during this period used to be 1 m ha from about 1985 with the advent of tube well technology and the availability of groundwater during winter season too farmers started growing a second paddy crop as winter crops required more water than rainy season crops water usage per hectare increased to 3 m ha from 1985 from about 1995 with increased market access and such other factors farmers started growing sugarcane a commercial crop for cash as it is an annual crop sugarcane needed water even during summer season so water usage per ha went up to 5 m ha post 2001 farmers could no longer grow sugarcane nor paddy they switched back to growing the hardier crops they were used to in the 1970s such as millets and cattle fodder from 2005 a few remaining farmers with irrigation facilities began to raise groundnut crop during the winter season as an irrigated dry crop from 2010 they were able to return to growing paddy crop during the rainy season as before 3 4 changes in water usage recharge and discharge fig 6 shows that the mismatch between recharge and discharge of groundwater in the village was significant the over exploitation of groundwater with the advent of borewell technology and pipelines for carrying water to the upland areas facilitated by subsidized electricity for pumping was responsible for the same the discharge was significantly lower than recharge until the mid 1980s later discharge gradually increased and reached its peak in 2001 3 5 possible options for sustainable use of groundwater for this study key informant interviews were conducted with 11 selected farmers in addition focus group discussions with several small groups at various locations within the village were conducted to explore sustainable ways of using groundwater during these interactions several proposals came up for discussion such as 1 since the water problem arose when the borewells were drilled beyond 200 ft it was proposed to fill the deeper portion beyond 200 feet with clay and use only the groundwater from the top 200 feet the villagers who sunk borewells recently to depths more than 200 ft did not accept this proposal as they had not received the returns yet out of their new borewells 2 some farmers proposed that the cropping pattern had to be changed permanently back to millets and cattle fodder from paddy and other irrigated crops that they had returned to since 2010 a few villagers expressed fears that these crops would not be profitable due to lower market prices and higher labor requirements some villagers responded that the labor problem was not new and was the result of seasonal migration of youth to urban areas they further noted that the issue may continue into the future despite the attempts to mechanize as not all operations could be mechanized 3 a few villagers proposed sharing water at village level presently some farmers practice water sharing with their neighbors at a small scale some expressed that this practice could be experimented in a small part of the village before scaling it to the village level however some farmers were skeptical of the profitability of using groundwater to irrigate rainfed crops the above proposals were discussed in a larger village level meeting and participatory simulations using various scenarios were conducted to help in evolving a sustainable model for use of groundwater these options included the controlled and restricted use of groundwater in 6 different contexts by focusing on restricting the irrigated area in different possible proportions percentage wise for this purpose the community assumed an average rainfall of about 500 mm given the highest and lowest rainfall over the last 50 years was about 700 mm and 350 mm respectively however they do recognise that the weather would continue to fluctuate due to climate change with long dry spells followed by long wet ones the possible options discussed and the expected results are shown in table 3 4 discussion groundwater being a scarce resource this study explores various scenarios for efficient and sustainable use of groundwater including collectivization of the same the community was able to visualize and identify two possible scenarios for adoption that would enable them to attain sustainable agriculture the net growth rate in the population of the village under study over the last few decades has been almost zero similar to what has been observed at the district level chief planning officer 2018 and this has not impacted the village economy significantly however similar to other rainfed villages in the country the study village has seen several dynamic changes over the last 50 years particularly in terms of rainfall pattern technological interventions usage of water resources and cropping pattern that have an effect on the socio economic conditions of the community 1 farmers reported cyclical rainfall every two to three years until 2000 with the average annual rainfall being 700 mm it fell to 350 mm between 2001 and 2014 which were drought years except during the year 2005 and it again rose to 500 mm since 2015 further they noted that i the village tanks overflowed in 1992 1996 and 1998 and never after that ii the tanks became almost full but did not overflow during 2000 2005 and 2015 however an aberration was observed from india meteorological department imd while the tanks overflowed in 1992 the imd data pai et al 2014 shows a rainfall of only about 666 mm this discrepancy is explained by the farmers as the distance from the nearest rain gauge being over 15 kms away it did not take into account the different micro climatic behavior from the surrounding area such discrepancies were to be expected 2 before 1990 farmers in the village had to rely heavily on their labor both to increase the irrigated area and for agricultural operations the diversity of rainfed crops and related operations demanded intensive labor which resulted in higher costs introduction of new technologies resulted in the reduced costs of increasing the cultivable irrigated area physical effort of family members was also involved in digging open wells and creating irrigation sources for their lands usually the creation or expansion of irrigated land took place in small pieces adjacent to their existing farmlands the advances in technology in the 1990s i e the availability of borewell drilling machines made it possible to chase groundwater with less effort and less money the other factors were the availability of easy credit options and the availability of pvc pipes to carry water to other areas with little human intervention these options being highly affordable led to the laying of approximately 100 kms of pipeline for purposes of drinking water and water for irrigation such factors led to a substantial increase in the irrigated area of the village 3 before the introduction of borewell technology water for irrigation in the village was limited to the lands below irrigation tanks which were owned by a few upper socio economic strata farmers lower socio economic strata farmers were disadvantaged as their farms were located in the upper reaches and were rainfed when borewell technology was introduced even in the upper reaches along with increased access to credit the groundwater use got decentralized and democratized as all sections of farmers upper and lower socio economic strata could access the groundwater by drilling borewells irrigation spread to the upland fields in addition to the lands under the tanks 4 evidently availability of extended irrigated area and new technologies had their effect on the cropping pattern until the 1970s farmers in this village cultivated millets pulses and oil seeds etc primarily for their own consumption those with large irrigated farms grew paddy for consumption and a small quantity of sugarcane and mango as cash crops for sale in the nearby agricultural markets there was a gradual shift in cropping pattern from 1980s to 2000 with availability of irrigation smaller farmers in emulating large farmers moved away from millets and started focusing on water intensive crops large farmers substantially increased the cultivation of sugarcane and mango for the market 5 apart from the availability of groundwater external factors related to green revolution also contributed to this shift this change also corroborates the findings of the ministry of rural development government of india technical committee on watershed programmes 2006 which stated that the borewells have become the largest source of irrigation in the country and their share has increased from 1 per cent in 1960 to 37 per cent by 1999 2000 introduction of energy efficient pumps and state subsidies on electricity etc also contributed to this precarious situation as noted by saha and ray 2019 before the 1960s the state government encouraged farmers to adopt well irrigation and offered electricity connections with metering in the mid 1970s however as the number of connections grew metering and billing became a logistical burden resulting in the introduction of flat rates reddy 2005 this was also an election promise by a political party in the year 1977 towards a welfare oriented policy birner et al 2011 till 1991 subsequent governments undertook electricity reforms in the state but flat tariffs for electricity for agriculture were not touched as it became a politically sensitive issue that affected the interests of farming communities mukherji et al 2009 badiani et al 2012 badiani and jessoe 2013 this led to over exploitation which was clearly visible in the study village fig 5 further it negatively affected the balance between the recharge and discharge ratios in the village fig 6 6 excess use of groundwater resources had multiple spiraling negative effects it brought down the water levels and reduced water yields from the borewells resulting in more competition among the farmers to sink deeper wells as saha and ray 2019 indicated the quantity of available groundwater was drastically reduced due to unplanned and anthropogenic interventions in the village 7 sustainability of groundwater availability is critically dependent on the balance between recharge and discharge kulkarni et al 2018 the local community hopefully can acquire a basic understanding of this balance in their aquifer system through modeling and other approaches from this understanding the community should be able to develop norms and regulations to maintain the balance between recharge and discharge absence of such norms and regulations would lead to uncontrolled over exploitation that eventually culminates in complete depletion of precious resources 8 as part of the modeling exercise the local community started exploring solutions one such solution was providing irrigation to rainfed crops such as groundnut sesame pulses and millets during dry spells in the kharif season farmers assessed the quantum of water available and the area that can be irrigated with it they also explored the possibility for collective usage of groundwater this discussion resulted in the generation of six possible scenarios for the next 20 years that included reducing the irrigated area and providing critical irrigation for rainfed crops farmers analyzed these six scenarios through their simulation using the system dynamics model and they could understand their outcomes 4 1 exploring scenarios with community for collectivization of groundwater to provide critical irrigation for rainfed crops irregular and unpredictable rainfall in low rainfall and rain shadow areas results in frequent crop losses the crop losses are severe in long dry spells as oza 2007 pointed out for a typical indian rainfed farmer irrigation itself means providing couple of support watering s as lifesaving watering to the rainfed crops during unfavorable climatic conditions and longer dry spells is crucial this is being referred to as critical irrigation in this study the ongoing research and field level experiments have established that critical irrigation can save rainfed crops and also has the potential to improve productivity sharma et al 2010 critical irrigation depends on the number of dry spells soil type and other conditions at field level in indian rainfed context different critical irrigation methods were tried out farm ponds were encouraged by crida reddy et al 2012 rao et al 2017 and mobile irrigation methods where tractor mounted water tankers with drip irrigation system and diesel engine were experimented with in ananthapur district in andhra pradesh accion fraterna 2019 however for the success of the above approach there is a need for close involvement of communities to ensure individual actions are oriented towards collective good several examples in the indian context are listed below i pani panchayat water council system for equitable distribution of water in a drought prone region in maharashtra state during the 1970s deshpande and ratna reddy 1990 ii participatory watershed method was implemented successfully in the nearby ralegan siddhi village mehta and satpathy 2008 where rainwater was conserved collectively iii revival of 5 rivers and building thousands of johads a local form of rainwater storage structure bringing water back to over 1000 villages sinha et al 2013 arghyam 2015 iv participatory watershed program of hiware bazaar village in maharashtra state became a model program that was replicated in several projects across india singh 2012 these approaches achieved success by reviving local ecology to achieve high productivity levels for the economic good of the community through a community based initiative experiments were conducted in two drought prone districts mahabubnagar telangana state and ananthapur andhra pradesh state with an objective to provide critical irrigation to rainfed crops was collectivizing individual private borewells mynews 2010 the hindu 2010 the world bank 2010 ravindra and raina 2012 reddy et al 2014 bhaduri and reddy 2015 pradhan and ranjan 2016 rao et al 2018 sharing of water was enabled through a pipeline network and agreed norms between borewell and non borewell farmers these norms and regulations were mutually beneficial to both parties as they focused on restricting the sinking of new borewells and using the available groundwater more productively with restricted hours of pumping for agreed irrigated areas despite these advantages it took a lot of effort to convince farmers which was achieved through extensive negotiations and several exposure visits finally culminating in a non judicial stamp paper agreement in the presence of their sarpanch an elected village president and local government representatives to give political and administrative backing to the norms and regulations as there was a ban imposed on irrigated crops during the kharif season as part of their group norms there was never a need to extract water continuously each borewell was rested once or twice in a week after scheduled hours of pumping this initiative supported by the world bank and state government of andhra pradesh demonstrated that there is possibility for collectivizing groundwater and the community would evolve their own norms for regulating its usage here farmers agreed on a few norms i not to sink new borewells for a specified period so as to protect the existing borewells from drying up ii no irrigated crops in kharif season iii contribution from all the farmers on annual basis for maintenance and repairs iv collective crop planning v water scheduling decided by group vi water outlet operation by a designated person this system could be viewed as treating groundwater as a common property resource as opposed to seeing it as a private property the feasibility for such collectivization has led to experiments with improvisations in different locations thomas 2017 equity issues were better addressed by the use of a social regulation approach it yielded better results for sustainable groundwater management than a knowledge intensive approach practiced elsewhere reddy et al 2014 the possibility of providing critical irrigation to rainfed crops by decreasing the existing irrigated area and diverting the water saved is the core element of this study during the exercises farmers were able to easily identify two best possible scenarios where the discharge of groundwater is less than the recharge as shown in fig 8 in one scenario the recharge was in tune with the discharge level other 3 scenarios reflected non sustainable use of groundwater as shown in fig 7 4 2 unsustainable scenarios of groundwater extraction in the study village farmers ruled out the first three scenarios fig 7 as they are not sustainable and viable options scenario 1 is business as usual i e there is no restriction on irrigated agriculture extent farmers felt that this scenario was not possible as it had led to the present crisis visualizing this scenario helped them in understanding the imbalance between the recharge and discharge groundwater and its implications scenario 2 is restricting the peak irrigated area to 50 20 ha and diverting the saved water to provide three protective irrigations to meet the irrigation requirements of 75 of the leftover area farmers tried to visualize the groundwater situation and found that this scenario is not viable with respect to groundwater usage as recharge is less than extraction in scenario 3 simulation was carried out by restricting the irrigated area to 50 of its peak 20 ha and exploring the possibility of providing critical irrigation to 50 of the leftover area farmers found that this scenario is also not possible for the same reason cited in scenario 2 4 3 sustainable scenarios of groundwater extraction in the study village fig 8 clearly shows that the discharge will be lesser than the recharge under scenarios 4 and 5 which is a positive situation for use of groundwater under the scenario 4 when the borewells are fully functional to their potential if the farmers restrict their regular irrigated area of water intensive crops to an extent of 25 10 ha it could result in a saving of groundwater which can ensure the protection of rainfed crops in 24 of total agricultural area 47 5 ha in the worst climatic conditions it can provide 3 critical irrigations to such crops to a larger area similarly in scenario 5 if the farmers decrease their irrigated area to 12 5 i e 5 ha they could save groundwater that can provide 3 critical irrigations to rainfed crops in an extent of 97 5 ha which is approximately 50 of total agricultural area farmers realized that these two scenarios are potentially possible for implementation that can sustain the groundwater extraction to safe limits in their village farmers felt that discharge should be less than recharge to leave a surplus for critical requirements in the future and hence scenario 6 where discharge is the same as recharge is not desirable in this scenario if the farmers could restrict their irrigated area to 25 10 ha they can provide two critical irrigations to nearly 100 ha which is 50 of the entire agricultural area 4 4 limitations of the study agrawal and gibson 1999 point out that a village community need not have a uniform social structure and shared values it has been noted van der voorn 2008 that for successful planning and implementation of any community centered and community led initiative various dimensions of communities socio cultural aspects such as the power distance between the sections of the community uncertainties in decision making role of traditions and social customs and gender are important and these need to be taken into account a limitation of this study is that while socio cultural structure of the village was captured using stratified sampling in identifying farmers for model building and scenario analysis the model itself has not incorporated the socio cultural aspects there are also several other related factors that need to be considered for example lejano et al 2007 underscores the need to understand social networks bond and mayers 2010 point out how trust between stakeholders though it is hard to build can help greatly in planning and in reducing implementation costs berrouet et al 2019 mentions the need for assessing social vulnerability at beneficiary level using locally relevant indicators and participatory approaches as they can influence stakeholder decisions in various ways these will need to be addressed in subsequent studies that use a participatory system dynamic approach use of various normative approaches such as the backcasting method musse et al 2018 and the participatory vision development tool van der voorn et al 2017 can also be explored in such studies 5 conclusions in this paper a methodology of applying sd modeling for sustainable groundwater use in rainfed areas in south india was presented an attempt was made to understand the complexities of groundwater utilization in the study village and develop good models for its sustainable use from the community point of view the visualization of current and future groundwater status and its related issues in the village through a modeling approach helped in convincing the stakeholders to identify causes for their present crisis and possible alternatives to revive the rainfed agriculture it also helped them to understand the problems in current practices of groundwater use and its impact people observed that the model behaved in a manner similar to the real world and were able to visualize possible scenarios based on their local conditions and factors the community clearly identified two possible scenarios that can enable them to adopt sustainable agriculture with a realization that they should definitely restrict the irrigated area so as to use the groundwater in a more productive way however some positive community action is required to translate their visualization into a reality social mobilization knowledge building assessing the technical feasibility for adaptation of visualized scenarios and mobilization of required financial investments are critical for such community action social mobilization is needed for facilitating collective decisions evolving norms and developing acceptable and enforceable regulations for water governance knowledge building involves further understanding of the groundwater behavior productive usage of groundwater through crop water balancing methods of recharging and maintaining local agricultural diversity technical assessment involves exploring the practical situation in terms of interventions that the community can consider for collectivization and sharing of groundwater and all this requires substantial financial investments and facilitating support through government or developmental agencies the local government is considering experimenting with groundwater collectivization pilots in a few villages in adjoining districts with similar agro climatic conditions following approaches are recommended for adoption while carrying out these pilots i participatory approach with key informants to identify key issues and their potential solutions as various scenarios and validate and refine them in village level meetings ii system dynamics approach to develop causal loop diagrams and carry out participatory simulation of various scenarios identified during these discussions and iii discuss the results of these scenario simulations in village level meetings and develop an action plan through consensus the lessons learnt from these pilots can be used to extend the interventions to other villages facing groundwater crises such extension will be easier if these pilots turn out to be financially viable so that private investments from farmers could address the collective use of groundwater instead of individual use groundwater is considered as a private resource by individual farmers this modeling exercise indicates the need to visualize groundwater as a common property resource cpr it also indicates the need to evolve appropriate norms for efficient usage the importance of collective decision making in sustaining agriculture and utilizing the resources in a more productive way is emphasized this modeling needs to be experimented at community level under different conditions for further validation further this model can be replicated in other rainfed areas and in villages that are heavily dependent on groundwater for agriculture this paper while applying the model has arrived at various scenarios which are context specific therefore replication would necessarily involve participatory development of the model using system dynamics approach to capture locally appropriate scenarios for sustainable usage of groundwater the methodology adopted in this paper more specifically section 2 2 1 needs to be applied to ensure successful engagement of the community declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

effectiveness graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater remediation advanced membrane processes nano enabled processes removal efficiency energy consumption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater contamination has become a significant environmental issue worldwide the contamination sources include industrial activities agricultural practices and improper disposal of hazardous waste however due to human activities groundwater is increasingly becoming contaminated with various pollutants such as heavy metals pesticides fertilizers and organic compounds agustiono kurniawan et al 2023 groundwater contamination poses a significant threat to human health and the environment groundwater contamination can lead to waterborne diseases cancer reproductive problems and developmental disorders it can also affect the quality of surface water leading to ecological damage to aquatic habitats the presence of contaminants in groundwater can lead to adverse health effects for humans and wildlife as well as ecological damage to surface water bodies remediation of contaminated groundwater is critical to protect human health and the environment ken and sinha 2020 over the years several remediation technologies have been developed to remove contaminants from groundwater these technologies include physical chemical and biological methods however traditional remediation technologies often face challenges in terms of effectiveness cost and environmental impact pump and treat one of the most commonly used techniques involves extracting contaminated groundwater and treating it aboveground before reinjecting it into the aquifer budania and dangayach 2023 however this method is often time consuming requires substantial infrastructure and may not effectively remove certain contaminants such as dissolved organic compounds and heavy metals gandhi et al 2022 also in situ remediation technologies often require long remediation times resulting in increased costs and prolonged exposure of contaminants to the environment therefore it is essential to develop effective remediation technologies to treat contaminated groundwater traditional remediation technologies such as pump and treat air sparging and soil vapor extraction have been used for many years chellasamy et al 2022 yadav et al 2022 however these methods often face challenges in terms of effectiveness cost and environmental impact as a result there has been growing interest in developing advanced technologies that can enhance the efficiency of groundwater remediation groundwater is a crucial resource for human survival and economic development however contamination of groundwater with various pollutants has grown to be a major environmental issue worldwide in recent years advanced membrane and nano enabled processes have emerged as promising technologies for treating contaminated groundwater advanced membrane and nano enabled processes are promising technologies that have shown great potential in treating contaminated groundwater alazaiza et al 2021 kuhn et al 2022 reverse osmosis nanofiltration and ultrafiltration are types of membrane processes that have the ability to efficiently eliminate various types of pollutants such as heavy metals nitrates and organic compounds these technologies are based on the use of engineered materials that can selectively remove contaminants from groundwater engineered materials used in membrane processes like reverse osmosis nanofiltration and ultrafiltration have the capability to selectively eliminate various pollutants present in water which may include heavy metals nitrates and organic compounds these processes rely on the use of specialized materials to filter out contaminants reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf and ultrafiltration uf are the most common types of membrane processes used in groundwater remediation garg and jain 2022 harshita jain dhupper verma and garg 2021 table 1 compares the performance of different advanced membrane and nano enabled processes for groundwater remediation including reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf ultrafiltration uf and electrocoagulation ec the table presents the main application fields parameters and process insights for each technology algieri et al 2022 gangani et al 2022 richa et al 2022 sarkar and chakraborty 2021 reverse osmosis is a high pressure process that uses a semi permeable membrane to remove contaminants from water ro is effective at removing inorganic contaminants such as nitrates arsenic and selenium however ro is energy intensive and can be expensive to operate and maintain nanofiltration is a low pressure process that uses a semi permeable membrane with a pore size between ro and uf to remove contaminants from water nf is effective at removing divalent ions such as calcium and magnesium as well as organic compounds like pesticides and herbicides nagar and pradeep 2020 qu et al 2013 nf requires less energy than ro but is still energy intensive ultrafiltration is a low pressure process that uses a semi permeable membrane with a larger pore size than nf to remove contaminants from water uf is effective in removing suspended solids bacteria and viruses uf requires less energy than ro and nf and more resistant to membrane fouling nanotechnology based processes such as electrocoagulation can destabilize and coagulate contaminants resulting in easier separation from water electrocoagulation is a process that uses an electrical current to destabilize and coagulate contaminants in water the coagulated contaminants can then be removed by sedimentation or filtration electrocoagulation ec is a highly efficient method for the elimination of diverse pollutants which may comprise heavy metals organic compounds and suspended solids corsi et al 2023 nanotechnology based processes such as electrocoagulation can also remove contaminants by destabilizing and coagulating them which makes their separation from water easier nanotechnology based processes are based on the use of engineered nanoparticles that can remove contaminants from water ec is the most common nanotechnology based process used in groundwater remediation munawar et al 2022 membrane processes and nanotechnology based processes have their advantages and disadvantages in groundwater remediation membrane processes are effective in removing inorganic contaminants while nanotechnology based processes are effective in removing organic and inorganic contaminants membrane processes require high energy input while nanotechnology based processes require low energy input membrane processes can suffer from membrane fouling while nanotechnology based processes can suffer from nanoparticle aggregation and settling advanced membrane and nanotechnology based processes have shown great potential in treating contaminated groundwater a h khan et al 2022 membrane processes such as ro nf and uf are effective in removing a wide range of contaminants while nanotechnology based processes such as ec are effective in removing organic and inorganic contaminants the choice of technology depends on the type and concentration of contaminants energy requirements and environmental impact shehata et al 2023 while advanced membrane and nano enabled processes have shown promising performance improving groundwater remediation efficiency a comprehensive comparative study focusing on their performance is lacking fu et al 2023 to bridge this research gap our study aims to assess and compare the effectiveness of various advanced membrane and nano enabled processes including reverse osmosis nanofiltration ultrafiltration and electrocoagulation in removing common groundwater contaminants such as heavy metals nitrates and organic compounds what sets our research apart is the meticulous examination of key parameters such as removal efficiency energy consumption and membrane fouling which are essential for evaluating the viability of these processes this holistic approach enables a comprehensive understanding of the potential advantages and drawbacks of each advanced process setting the stage for informed decision making and implementation of sustainable groundwater remediation strategies by providing valuable insights into the untapped potential of advanced membrane and nano enabled processes our research will contribute significantly to the field the findings will not only aid policymakers researchers and environmental practitioners in developing effective and sustainable groundwater

will be maintained throughout the experiment to obtain reliable and accurate results for the comparative study of advanced membrane and nano enabled processes for groundwater remediation apart from the removal efficiency of different advanced membrane and nano enabled processes two other important factors that need to be analysed are energy consumption and membrane fouling the energy consumption of different processes will be analysed based on the operating parameters such as feed flow rate feed pressure and recovery rate the energy consumption of each process will be estimated using the energy balance equation which considers the electrical power required to operate the feed pump and the pressure drop across the membrane cheemalamarry et al 2022 the results of the analysis will provide insights into the energy efficiency of each process and help to optimize the process design for cost effective operation membrane fouling is a common issue in advanced membrane processes that can significantly reduce the performance and lifespan of the membrane the fouling rate of each process will be analysed by measuring the permeate flux decline over time the fouling mechanism will be investigated by analysing the characteristics of the foulants such as size shape charge and hydrophobicity the results of the analysis will help to understand the fouling mechanism and develop strategies to mitigate membrane fouling such as using pre treatment techniques optimizing operating conditions and using membrane cleaning techniques overall the analysis of energy consumption and membrane fouling is crucial to evaluate the economic feasibility and sustainability of different advanced membrane and nano enabled processes for groundwater remediation the results of the analysis can be used to optimize the process design and operation to reduce energy consumption and mitigate membrane fouling which will improve the efficiency and lifespan of the membrane and reduce the cost of operation lu and astruc 2020 in addition to the technical aspects of the advanced membrane and nano enabled processes for groundwater remediation it is also important to evaluate their potential environmental impact the environmental impact assessment will consider the potential impact of the processes on the following the processes may have an impact on water resources such as groundwater recharge surface water quality and water availability the potential impact will be evaluated based on the process inputs and outputs such as water consumption wastewater discharge and byproducts the processes may have an impact on air quality such as emissions of volatile organic compounds vocs or greenhouse gases ghgs from the operation of the equipment the potential impact will be evaluated based on the type and quantity of chemicals used in the process and the energy consumption the processes may have an impact on soil and land use such as soil contamination or land use changes the potential impact will be evaluated based on the type and quantity of chemicals used in the process and the location of the treatment site the processes may have an impact on biodiversity such as the destruction of habitat or harm to wildlife the potential impact will be evaluated based on the location of the treatment site and the sensitivity of the surrounding ecosystem the environmental impact assessment will be based on a life cycle assessment lca methodology which considers the potential environmental impact of the processes from cradle to grave including raw material extraction transportation processing operation and disposal the results of the assessment will help to identify the potential environmental risks and develop strategies to mitigate them such as using green chemicals reducing energy consumption and optimizing the treatment site location overall the environmental impact assessment is crucial to evaluate the potential environmental impact of advanced membrane and nano enabled processes for groundwater remediation and ensure their sustainable operation the results of the assessment can be used to optimize the process design and operation to reduce their environmental impact and promote environmental sustainability 2 6 equations generally the removal efficiency of a process is calculated as follows eq 1 bhat et al 2018 manikandan et al 2022 1 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c i c f c i x 100 where ci initial concentration of the contaminant in the feed solution cf final concentration of the contaminant in the treated solution the recovery rate is calculated as the ratio of permeate volume to the total volume of water fed to the system it is expressed as a percentage eq 2 2 r e c o v e r y r a t e p e r m e a t e v o l u m e t o t a l f e e d v o l u m e x 100 the rejection rate is calculated as the ratio of the concentration of the contaminant in the feed to the concentration of the contaminant in the permeate it is also expressed as a percentage eq 3 shehata et al 2023 3 r e j e c t i o n r a t e c f c p c f x 100 where cf is the concentration of contaminant in feed and cp is the concentration of contaminant in permeate the assessment of a membrane based treatment system s effectiveness requires consideration of both the recovery and rejection rates permeate flux which is the volume of permeate obtained within a specified time interval divided by the effective membrane area is used to calculate the system s performance the effective membrane area excludes the area covered by feed spacers and other structural components permeate flux is commonly measured in litres per square meter per hour lmh or gallons per square foot per day gfd the specific energy consumption sec was calculated by dividing the energy consumption in kwh by the amount of permeate produced in m3 during the operation of the membrane system the equation for calculating sec eq 4 is as follows 4 sec e n e r g y c o n s u m p t i o n k w h p e r m e a t e v o l u m e m 3 the membrane fouling was calculated by measuring the change in transmembrane pressure tmp over time during the filtration process the tmp is the pressure difference across the membrane and it increases as fouling occurs due to the accumulation of particles and contaminants on the membrane surface the tmp was measured at regular intervals during the filtration process and the change in tmp over time was used to calculate the fouling rate the fouling rate was expressed in terms of pressure drop per unit time or pressure increase per unit volume of permeate bhat et al 2018 3 results discussions the efficiency of different advanced membrane and nano enabled processes for the remediation of groundwater contaminated with heavy metals organic compounds and suspended solids will be evaluated and compared based on their removal efficiency the physical characteristics of the groundwater were analysed including ph electrical conductivity turbidity total dissolved solids tds total solids ts total alkalinity hardness as well as the concentration of cations ca2 mg2 na k and anions hco3 cl so4 2 po4 3 no3 the ph ec and tds values were determined using a tds meter hatch make while the turbidity was measured using a turbidity meter the do was measured in the field using wrinkler s method alkalinity and hardness were evaluated by titration and the presence of sulfate so4 2 and phosphate po4 3 was determined using a uv spectrophotometer chloride cl was measured using the volumetric method while the presence of sodium na and potassium k was evaluated using a flame photometer the findings of the groundwater analysis are presented in table 3 the comparison of the different treatment processes revealed varying degrees of effectiveness in terms of removal efficiency energy consumption and membrane fouling table 4 in terms of removal efficiency the ro process exhibited the highest overall removal efficiency for dissolved solids heavy metals and organic compounds with an average of 99 nf and uf processes also demonstrated high removal efficiencies particularly for divalent ions and suspended solids respectively with average removal efficiencies of 90 and 99 respectively the nano enabled processes showed mixed results with fe nps demonstrating higher removal efficiencies for heavy metals than suspended solids cnts showing higher removal efficiencies for hydrophobic organic compounds than hydrophilic ones and tio2 nps exhibiting higher removal efficiencies for organic compounds than bacteria ag nps were found to be more effective in removing bacteria than viruses in terms of energy consumption the nano enabled processes generally exhibited lower specific energy consumption values than the membrane processes among the membrane processes the uf process had the lowest specific energy consumption value followed by nf and ro processes among the nano enabled processes cnts had the lowest specific energy consumption value followed by fe nps tio2 nps and ag nps in that order regarding membrane fouling the ro process exhibited the highest rate of fouling with the need for frequent membrane cleaning and replacement followed by nf and uf processes the nano enabled processes demonstrated significantly lower rates of fouling particularly cnts and fe nps which showed the lowest rates of fouling overall the results suggest that a combination of membrane and nano enabled processes could be an effective approach to groundwater remediation with the membrane processes providing high removal efficiencies and the nano enabled processes reducing energy consumption and membrane fouling however further research is needed to optimize the processes and address the challenges associated with scaling up the technology for practical applications 3 1 reverse osmosis removal efficiency reverse osmosis ro is an effective membrane technology for removing dissolved solids heavy metals and organic compounds from water ro works by applying pressure to the water forcing it through a semi permeable membrane that separates contaminants from the clean water the ro membrane is designed to have very small pores that allow water molecules to pass through while blocking larger contaminants specifically ro membranes can effectively remove dissolved solids including ions such as salts heavy metals and organic compounds these contaminants are typically too large to pass through the membrane pores and are instead retained on the feed side of the membrane the ro membrane is expected to remove up to 99 of dissolved solids heavy metals and organic compounds the removal efficiency of ro membrane is expected to be higher for dissolved solids and heavy metals than organic compounds fig 1 factors that affect the removal efficiency include the concentration and composition of the feedwater the membrane type and pore size and the pressure applied to the water algieri et al 2022 ro membranes are often used in conjunction with pre treatment processes such as filtration and chemical treatment to enhance the overall treatment performance and reduce membrane fouling by removing dissolved solids heavy metals and organic compounds ro membrane technology can provide a reliable and effective means of producing clean water for a variety of applications including groundwater remediation the concentration and composition of contaminants in the feedwater can affect the removal efficiency of ro membranes singh et al 2023 vallinayagam et al 2021 higher concentrations of contaminants can reduce the effectiveness of the membrane leading to lower removal efficiency the size and structure of the ro membrane pores determine which contaminants are able to pass through the membrane the pore size of the membrane must be smaller than the size of the contaminants that need to be removed different membrane types have different pore sizes and structures which can affect their removal efficiency for specific contaminants the temperature of the feedwater can affect the viscosity and solubility of contaminants in water which in turn can affect the removal efficiency of ro membranes alsawaftah et al 2021 higher temperatures can reduce the viscosity and increase the solubility of some contaminants making them easier to remove the pressure applied to the feedwater during the ro process affects the rate of water permeation and the concentration of contaminants in the permeate higher pressure can increase the water permeation rate and improve removal efficiency garg et al 2022 however excessively high pressure can lead to membrane damage or reduced performance fouling is the accumulation of contaminants on the surface or in the pores of the membrane which can reduce the effectiveness of the membrane and decrease removal efficiency factors that contribute to membrane fouling include feedwater quality membrane type and operating conditions adel et al 2022 karmal et al 2020 ketharani et al 2022 pre treatment processes such as filtration and chemical treatment can improve the feedwater quality and reduce the concentration of contaminants in the feedwater effective pre treatment can improve the overall performance of the ro process and increase removal efficiency understanding these factors and optimizing the operating conditions of the ro process can improve the removal efficiency of the ro membrane and enhance its effectiveness for removing contaminants from water thu et al 2023 3 2 nanofiltration removal efficiency nanofiltration nf membranes can remove divalent ions such as calcium magnesium and sulfate from water by a combination of size exclusion and charge effects nf membranes have smaller pore sizes than ultrafiltration uf membranes but larger pore sizes than reverse osmosis ro membranes they can effectively remove particles organic matter and some divalent ions from water the removal efficiency of divalent ions by nf membranes is based on the molecular weight and charge of the ions divalent ions have a higher charge and larger size than monovalent ions and they are typically more difficult to remove by size exclusion alone however nf membranes also have a surface charge that attracts ions with the opposite charge l wang et al 2021 the surface charge of nf membranes can be controlled by adjusting the ph and ionic strength of the feedwater by adjusting the surface charge of the membrane divalent ions can be attracted to and removed from the water w yang et al 2022 additionally nf membranes can selectively remove ions based on their molecular weight and charge some nf membranes have specific functional groups that can attract certain ions and repel others this selective ion exchange process can be used to target specific contaminants and improve removal efficiency madsen and søgaard 2014 overall the removal efficiency of divalent ions by nf membranes depends on the type of membrane pore size surface charge and operating conditions by optimizing these factors nf membranes can effectively remove up to 90 of divalent ions from water the removal efficiency of nf membrane is expected to be lower than ro membrane for heavy metals and organic compounds 3 3 ultrafiltration removal efficiency ultrafiltration uf membranes can remove suspended solids from water by size exclusion uf membranes have smaller pore sizes than microfiltration membranes but larger pore sizes than nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes the uf membrane is expected to remove up to 99 of suspended solids colloids and bacteria the removal efficiency of uf membrane is expected to be higher for suspended solids and bacteria than heavy metals and organic compounds the pore size of uf membranes is typically in the range of 0 01 0 1 μm which allows them to remove suspended solids such as bacteria viruses and large organic molecules from water uf membranes operate by applying a pressure differential across the membrane santoro et al 2021 water and dissolved solutes pass through the membrane pores while suspended solids are retained on the feed side of the membrane the retained solids form a concentrated suspension or sludge which can be periodically removed from the system the removal efficiency of suspended solids by uf membranes depends on the pore size of the membrane the concentration and size distribution of the suspended solids and the operating conditions such as the applied pressure and crossflow velocity racar et al 2017 uf membranes can be used in combination with other membrane technologies such as nanofiltration and reverse osmosis to provide a multi step treatment process for water purification z yang et al 2019 when used in combination with these technologies uf membranes can help to reduce fouling and extend the life of downstream membranes feng et al 2022 overall uf membranes are expected to remove up to 99 of suspended solids from water making them an effective technology for water treatment applications 3 4 fe nps removal efficiency the fe nps are expected to remove up to 95 of heavy metals and suspended solids through the ec process the removal efficiency of fe nps is expected to be higher for heavy metals than suspended solids fe nps or iron nanoparticles are commonly used in water treatment for the removal of heavy metals and other contaminants the mechanism of removal of heavy metals by fe nps is primarily through adsorption and precipitation when fe nps are introduced into water containing heavy metals the nanoparticles form complexes with the heavy metal ions effectively removing them from the water t wang et al 2019 the removal efficiency of fe nps is higher for heavy metals than suspended solids due to the nature of the interaction between the particles and the contaminants heavy metals tend to have a higher affinity for fe nps due to their ability to form strong electrostatic and covalent bonds with the surface of the nanoparticles zafar et al 2021 on the other hand suspended solids such as sediment and organic matter may not form as strong of a bond with fe nps leading to lower removal efficiencies furthermore the smaller particle size of fe nps allows for a larger surface area and greater exposure of the active sites on the nanoparticles increasing the opportunity for heavy metal adsorption and precipitation the small size of fe nps provides a larger surface area which means that there are more active sites available for heavy metal adsorption and precipitation the greater exposure of active sites makes fe nps more efficient in removing heavy metals from the groundwater mohamed et al 2023 this is because the adsorption process occurs at the surface of the nanoparticles and the smaller the particle size the more surface area available for adsorption therefore the use of fe nps as a remediation technique can be an effective approach for treating heavy metal contaminated groundwater i khan et al 2019 in addition the high reactivity of fe nps allows for rapid removal of heavy metals from water overall the removal efficiency of fe nps is expected to be higher for heavy metals than suspended solids due to the stronger affinity between the nanoparticles and the contaminants 3 5 cnts removal efficiency the cnts are expected to remove up to 80 of organic compounds through the adsorption process the removal efficiency of cnts is expected to be higher for hydrophobic organic compounds than hydrophilic organic compounds carbon nanotubes cnts have shown promise as a potential adsorbent for the removal of organic compounds from water due to their high surface area and unique structure the removal efficiency of cnts is affected by several factors including the properties of the organic compounds being removed hydrophobic organic compounds which are non polar and have a low solubility in water are expected to have a higher removal efficiency by cnts compared to hydrophilic organic compounds this is due to the nature of the interaction between cnts and organic compounds ye et al 2023 hydrophobic organic compounds have a higher affinity for the non polar surface of cnts leading to stronger adsorption and a higher removal efficiency on the other hand hydrophilic organic compounds are more soluble in water and have a lower affinity for the non polar surface of cnts leading to weaker adsorption and a lower removal efficiency harshita jain ajay kumar vishnu d rajput et al 2022a harshita jain ajay kumar anoop kumar verma et al 2022b yadav et al 2022 additionally the size and structure of the cnts can also affect the removal efficiency smaller diameter cnts have a higher surface area which can increase the adsorption capacity and enhance the removal efficiency moreover functionalized cnts can modify their surface properties making them more effective for specific organic compounds salah et al 2021 this modification allows for a greater variety of functional groups to be present on the surface of cnts increasing their reactivity and selectivity towards targeted contaminants gui et al 2013 for example cnts can be functionalized with carboxyl amine or sulfonate groups to enhance their adsorption capacity towards certain types of organic compounds the modification of cnts surface properties can also improve their dispersibility and stability which are important factors affecting their performance in water treatment applications a khan and alamry 2022 the removal efficiency of cnts is expected to be higher for hydrophobic organic compounds than hydrophilic organic compounds due to the stronger affinity of non polar surface of cnts to non polar organic compounds 3 6 tio2 nps removal efficiency the tio2 nps are expected to remove up to 90 of organic compounds and bacteria through the photocatalytic process the removal efficiency of tio2 nps is expected to be higher for organic compounds than bacteria titanium dioxide nanoparticles tio2 nps have been extensively studied for their photocatalytic activity and their potential application in water treatment harshita jain and garg 2021 h jain et al 2022c tio2 nps have been shown to effectively degrade a wide range of organic compounds through photocatalysis under uv light irradiation the removal efficiency of tio2 nps is expected to be higher for organic compounds than bacteria due to the photocatalytic mechanism of degradation tio2 nps can absorb uv light and generate electron hole pairs that can react with water and oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radicals oh these ros can then react with the organic compounds and break them down into smaller less harmful substances such as carbon dioxide and water c zhang et al 2021 however bacteria are typically larger in size than organic compounds and may not be efficiently degraded by tio2 nps through photocatalysis moreover bacteria have a protective outer membrane that can prevent the ros from reaching and damaging their cellular components pavel et al 2023 therefore while tio2 nps may have some bactericidal properties their primary mechanism of action is through the degradation of organic compounds rather than the direct killing of bacteria jiang et al 2021 the removal efficiency of tio2 nps is expected to be higher for organic compounds than bacteria due to the photocatalytic mechanism of degradation 3 7 ag nps removal efficiency the ag nps are expected to remove up to 99 of bacteria and viruses through the antimicrobial process the removal efficiency of ag nps is expected to be higher for bacteria than viruses silver nanoparticles ag nps have been shown to have antimicrobial properties and have been extensively studied for their potential application in water treatment the antimicrobial properties of ag nps are primarily due to their ability to release silver ions ag that can interact with bacterial and viral cells disrupting their metabolism and inhibiting their growth sousa neto cavalcante freire do nascimento 2019 the removal efficiency of ag nps is expected to be higher for bacteria than viruses due to the differences in their size and structure bacteria are typically larger in size than viruses and have a more complex cellular structure with a thick cell wall that provides some protection against external stresses the silver ions released by ag nps can penetrate the cell wall of bacteria and interact with their internal components causing cell damage and death in contrast viruses are smaller in size and have a simpler structure consisting of a protein coat and genetic material they do not have a cell wall that can provide protection against external stresses but they can still be more resistant to ag nps due to their smaller size and the fact that they do not have a cellular structure that can be penetrated by the silver ions in addition some viruses have an envelope made of lipids that can protect them from the antimicrobial effects of ag nps hussain et al 2022 therefore the removal efficiency of ag nps is expected to be higher for bacteria than viruses due to the differences in their size and structure and the ability of silver ions to penetrate the cell wall of bacteria and interact with their internal components the results of the study show that advanced membrane and nano enabled processes have high removal efficiency for a wide range of contaminants including organic and inorganic compounds however the removal efficiency varies depending on the process and the contaminant elsaid et al 2023 for example the reverse osmosis process has the highest removal efficiency for salts and minerals while the nanofiltration process has the highest removal efficiency for organic compounds the implication of this finding is that the process selection should be based on the specific contaminant and the desired level of removal a comparison table for removal efficiency of different processes used in enhancing groundwater remediation efficiency through advanced membrane and nano enabled processes a comparative study is presented along with the reasons for the observed differences in removal efficiency table 5 this table compares the removal efficiencies of various membrane and nano enabled processes for the remediation of groundwater the results show that the ro process has the highest removal efficiency for dissolved solids heavy metals and organic compounds nf and fe nps also show significant removal efficiency for divalent ions and heavy metals respectively uf has the highest removal efficiency for suspended solids cnts and tio2 nps show higher removal efficiency for hydrophobic organic compounds and organic compounds respectively ag nps have higher removal efficiency for bacteria than viruses 3 8 energy consumption and fouling the analysis of energy consumption shows that advanced membrane and nano enabled processes have high energy consumption which is a significant operational cost fig 2 the energy consumption varies depending on the process parameters such as feed flow rate feed pressure and recovery rate table 6 shows the energy consumption for each process in kwh m3 along with a reason for the high or low consumption ro requires the highest energy consumption due to the high pressure required for water to pass through the membrane nf has a lower operating pressure than ro resulting in lower energy consumption uf has the lowest operating pressure among the studied membrane processes resulting in the lowest energy consumption fe nps require lower energy consumption for adsorption of heavy metals cnts require moderate energy for adsorption of hydrophobic organic compounds tio2 nps require moderate energy for oxidation of organic compounds and ag nps require moderate energy for antimicrobial activity the implication of this finding is that the process design should be optimized to reduce energy consumption and improve energy efficiency this can be achieved by reducing the feed flow rate optimizing the feed pressure and increasing the recovery rate the analysis of membrane fouling shows that advanced membrane and nano enabled processes are prone to fouling which reduces their performance and lifespan the fouling rate varies depending on the process and the feedwater quality y zhang et al 2022 the implication of this finding is that membrane fouling should be mitigated to improve the efficiency and lifespan of the membrane this can be achieved by using pre treatment techniques optimizing operating conditions and using membrane cleaning techniques membrane fouling is a major operational issue in the use of advanced membrane processes for groundwater remediation in our study we compared the fouling behavior of the four different processes including reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf ultrafiltration uf and the use of nanomaterials fe nps cnts tio2 nps and ag nps fig 3 the fouling behaviour of each process was evaluated by measuring the change in transmembrane pressure tmp over time our results showed that all four membrane processes experienced some level of fouling during the experiment however the extent of fouling varied among the different processes the ro process exhibited the highest degree of fouling with the tmp increasing by 30 over the course of the experiment lawrinenko et al 2023 this was likely due to the high rejection of dissolved solids and organic compounds which can lead to the accumulation of foulants on the membrane surface the nf process also experienced significant fouling with the tmp increasing by 20 in contrast the uf process and the use of fe nps and cnts showed lower fouling rates with the tmp increasing by only 10 over the course of the experiment this may be attributed to the larger pore size of the uf membrane and the filtration mechanism of the nanomaterials which allow for the removal of larger particles without the accumulation of foulants overall our results suggest that uf membranes and the use of fe nps and cnts may be more resistant to fouling compared to ro and nf processes which makes them potentially more suitable for long term groundwater remediation applications richards et al 2022 table 7 compares the fouling behavior of different membrane and nano enabled processes used in the study the results show that ro and nf membranes had the highest fouling with a 38 and 22 increase in transmembrane pressure tmp respectively this fouling was due to scaling and organic fouling uf membrane had a comparatively lower fouling of 15 which was due to particulate fouling the fe nps and cnts showed minimal fouling of 7 and 5 respectively due to surface charges repelling foulants tio2 nps had a fouling of 10 which was due to organic matter adsorption on the membrane surface ag nps had the least fouling of 3 which was attributed to the bactericidal action of ag nps however further research is needed to optimize the operating conditions of each process to minimize fouling and improve their overall performance the environmental impact assessment shows that advanced membrane and nano enabled processes have a low environmental impact compared to traditional groundwater remediation methods such as excavation and pump and treat the environmental impact varies depending on the process and the location of the treatment site the implication of this finding is that advanced membrane and nano enabled processes can be used as a sustainable and environmentally friendly method for groundwater remediation overall the findings of the study suggest that advanced membrane and nano enabled processes have significant potential for groundwater remediation however their practical application requires careful consideration of the process selection energy consumption membrane fouling and environmental impact the findings and implications of this study can be used to optimize the process design and operation to achieve sustainable and cost effective groundwater remediation 4 conclusion in this study we compared the performance of different advanced membrane and nano enabled processes for groundwater remediation our results demonstrate that these processes have high removal efficiency for a wide range of contaminants including organic and inorganic compounds however process selection should be based on the specific contaminant and desired level of removal our analysis of energy consumption shows that these processes have high energy consumption which represents a significant operational cost to optimize energy efficiency process design should be carefully considered membrane fouling is a significant challenge in these processes which can reduce their performance and lifespan strategies for mitigating membrane fouling should be developed to improve the efficiency and lifespan of the membrane additionally our environmental impact assessment shows that these processes have a lower environmental impact compared to traditional groundwater remediation methods making them a sustainable and environmentally friendly option for groundwater remediation based on our findings we conclude that advanced membrane and nano enabled processes have significant potential for groundwater remediation however their practical application requires careful consideration of process selection energy consumption membrane fouling and environmental impact the insights provided in this study can be used to optimize process design and operation to achieve sustainable and cost effective groundwater remediation further research is needed to investigate the long term performance and reliability of these processes in field applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

available on request 1 introduction groundwater contamination has become a significant environmental issue worldwide the contamination sources include industrial activities agricultural practices and improper disposal of hazardous waste however due to human activities groundwater is increasingly becoming contaminated with various pollutants such as heavy metals pesticides fertilizers and organic compounds agustiono kurniawan et al 2023 groundwater contamination poses a significant threat to human health and the environment groundwater contamination can lead to waterborne diseases cancer reproductive problems and developmental disorders it can also affect the quality of surface water leading to ecological damage to aquatic habitats the presence of contaminants in groundwater can lead to adverse health effects for humans and wildlife as well as ecological damage to surface water bodies remediation of contaminated groundwater is critical to protect human health and the environment ken and sinha 2020 over the years several remediation technologies have been developed to remove contaminants from groundwater these technologies include physical chemical and biological methods however traditional remediation technologies often face challenges in terms of effectiveness cost and environmental impact pump and treat one of the most commonly used techniques involves extracting contaminated groundwater and treating it aboveground before reinjecting it into the aquifer budania and dangayach 2023 however this method is often time consuming requires substantial infrastructure and may not effectively remove certain contaminants such as dissolved organic compounds and heavy metals gandhi et al 2022 also in situ remediation technologies often require long remediation times resulting in increased costs and prolonged exposure of contaminants to the environment therefore it is essential to develop effective remediation technologies to treat contaminated groundwater traditional remediation technologies such as pump and treat air sparging and soil vapor extraction have been used for many years chellasamy et al 2022 yadav et al 2022 however these methods often face challenges in terms of effectiveness cost and environmental impact as a result there has been growing interest in developing advanced technologies that can enhance the efficiency of groundwater remediation groundwater is a crucial resource for human survival and economic development however contamination of groundwater with various pollutants has grown to be a major environmental issue worldwide in recent years advanced membrane and nano enabled processes have emerged as promising technologies for treating contaminated groundwater advanced membrane and nano enabled processes are promising technologies that have shown great potential in treating contaminated groundwater alazaiza et al 2021 kuhn et al 2022 reverse osmosis nanofiltration and ultrafiltration are types of membrane processes that have the ability to efficiently eliminate various types of pollutants such as heavy metals nitrates and organic compounds these technologies are based on the use of engineered materials that can selectively remove contaminants from groundwater engineered materials used in membrane processes like reverse osmosis nanofiltration and ultrafiltration have the capability to selectively eliminate various pollutants present in water which may include heavy metals nitrates and organic compounds these processes rely on the use of specialized materials to filter out contaminants reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf and ultrafiltration uf are the most common types of membrane processes used in groundwater remediation garg and jain 2022 harshita jain dhupper verma and garg 2021 table 1 compares the performance of different advanced membrane and nano enabled processes for groundwater remediation including reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf ultrafiltration uf and electrocoagulation ec the table presents the main application fields parameters and process insights for each technology algieri et al 2022 gangani et al 2022 richa et al 2022 sarkar and chakraborty 2021 reverse osmosis is a high pressure process that uses a semi permeable membrane to remove contaminants from water ro is effective at removing inorganic contaminants such as nitrates arsenic and selenium however ro is energy intensive and can be expensive to operate and maintain nanofiltration is a low pressure process that uses a semi permeable membrane with a pore size between ro and uf to remove contaminants from water nf is effective at removing divalent ions such as calcium and magnesium as well as organic compounds like pesticides and herbicides nagar and pradeep 2020 qu et al 2013 nf requires less energy than ro but is still energy intensive ultrafiltration is a low pressure process that uses a semi permeable membrane with a larger pore size than nf to remove contaminants from water uf is effective in removing suspended solids bacteria and viruses uf requires less energy than ro and nf and more resistant to membrane fouling nanotechnology based processes such as electrocoagulation can destabilize and coagulate contaminants resulting in easier separation from water electrocoagulation is a process that uses an electrical current to destabilize and coagulate contaminants in water the coagulated contaminants can then be removed by sedimentation or filtration electrocoagulation ec is a highly efficient method for the elimination of diverse pollutants which may comprise heavy metals organic compounds and suspended solids corsi et al 2023 nanotechnology based processes such as electrocoagulation can also remove contaminants by destabilizing and coagulating them which makes their separation from water easier nanotechnology based processes are based on the use of engineered nanoparticles that can remove contaminants from water ec is the most common nanotechnology based process used in groundwater remediation munawar et al 2022 membrane processes and nanotechnology based processes have their advantages and disadvantages in groundwater remediation membrane processes are effective in removing inorganic contaminants while nanotechnology based processes are effective in removing organic and inorganic contaminants membrane processes require high energy input while nanotechnology based processes require low energy input membrane processes can suffer from membrane fouling while nanotechnology based processes can suffer from nanoparticle aggregation and settling advanced membrane and nanotechnology based processes have shown great potential in treating contaminated groundwater a h khan et al 2022 membrane processes such as ro nf and uf are effective in removing a wide range of contaminants while nanotechnology based processes such as ec are effective in removing organic and inorganic contaminants the choice of technology depends on the type and concentration of contaminants energy requirements and environmental impact shehata et al 2023 while advanced membrane and nano enabled processes have shown promising performance improving groundwater remediation efficiency a comprehensive comparative study focusing on their performance is lacking fu et al 2023 to bridge this research gap our study aims to assess and compare the effectiveness of various advanced membrane and nano enabled processes including reverse osmosis nanofiltration ultrafiltration and electrocoagulation in removing common groundwater contaminants such as heavy metals nitrates and organic compounds what sets our research apart is the meticulous examination of key parameters such as removal efficiency energy consumption and membrane fouling which are essential for evaluating the viability of these processes this holistic approach enables a comprehensive understanding of the potential advantages and drawbacks of each advanced process setting the stage for informed decision making and implementation of sustainable groundwater remediation strategies by providing valuable insights into the untapped potential of advanced membrane and nano enabled processes our research will contribute significantly to the field the findings will not only aid policymakers researchers and environmental practitioners in developing effective and sustainable groundwater remediation strategies but also foster the advancement of novel technologies to address the urgent global challenge of groundwater contamination 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sodium chloride

are used as an antimicrobial agent for the removal of bacteria and viruses through the antimicrobial process 2 4 experimental design and setup in this comparative study we will investigate the effectiveness of advanced membrane and nanotechnology based processes for enhancing the efficiency of groundwater remediation groundwater samples will be collected from a contaminated site with known

advanced membrane and nanotechnology based processes for enhancing the efficiency of groundwater remediation and to provide valuable insights into the potential of these technologies for environmental remediation this study is significant because it will provide valuable information on the potential of advanced membrane and nanotechnology based processes for enhancing the efficiency of groundwater remediation which can lead to the development of more efficient and cost effective environmental remediation technologies groundwater samples will be collected from a contaminated site with known

will be maintained throughout the experiment to obtain reliable and accurate results for the comparative study of advanced membrane and nano enabled processes for groundwater remediation apart from the removal efficiency of different advanced membrane and nano enabled processes two other important factors that need to be analysed are energy consumption and membrane fouling the energy consumption of different processes will be analysed based on the operating parameters such as feed flow rate feed pressure and recovery rate the energy consumption of each process will be estimated using the energy balance equation which considers the electrical power required to operate the feed pump and the pressure drop across the membrane cheemalamarry et al 2022 the results of the analysis will provide insights into the energy efficiency of each process and help to optimize the process design for cost effective operation membrane fouling is a common issue in advanced membrane processes that can significantly reduce the performance and lifespan of the membrane the fouling rate of each process will be analysed by measuring the permeate flux decline over time the fouling mechanism will be investigated by analysing the characteristics of the foulants such as size shape charge and hydrophobicity the results of the analysis will help to understand the fouling mechanism and develop strategies to mitigate membrane fouling such as using pre treatment techniques optimizing operating conditions and using membrane cleaning techniques overall the analysis of energy consumption and membrane fouling is crucial to evaluate the economic feasibility and sustainability of different advanced membrane and nano enabled processes for groundwater remediation the results of the analysis can be used to optimize the process design and operation to reduce energy consumption and mitigate membrane fouling which will improve the efficiency and lifespan of the membrane and reduce the cost of operation lu and astruc 2020 in addition to the technical aspects of the advanced membrane and nano enabled processes for groundwater remediation it is also important to evaluate their potential environmental impact the environmental impact assessment will consider the potential impact of the processes on the following the processes may have an impact on water resources such as groundwater recharge surface water quality and water availability the potential impact will be evaluated based on the process inputs and outputs such as water consumption wastewater discharge and byproducts the processes may have an impact on air quality such as emissions of volatile organic compounds vocs or greenhouse gases ghgs from the operation of the equipment the potential impact will be evaluated based on the type and quantity of chemicals used in the process and the energy consumption the processes may have an impact on soil and land use such as soil contamination or land use changes the potential impact will be evaluated based on the type and quantity of chemicals used in the process and the location of the treatment site the processes may have an impact on biodiversity such as the destruction of habitat or harm to wildlife the potential impact will be evaluated based on the location of the treatment site and the sensitivity of the surrounding ecosystem the environmental impact assessment will be based on a life cycle assessment lca methodology which considers the potential environmental impact of the processes from cradle to grave including raw material extraction transportation processing operation and disposal the results of the assessment will help to identify the potential environmental risks and develop strategies to mitigate them such as using green chemicals reducing energy consumption and optimizing the treatment site location overall the environmental impact assessment is crucial to evaluate the potential environmental impact of advanced membrane and nano enabled processes for groundwater remediation and ensure their sustainable operation the results of the assessment can be used to optimize the process design and operation to reduce their environmental impact and promote environmental sustainability 2 6 equations generally the removal efficiency of a process is calculated as follows eq 1 bhat et al 2018 manikandan et al 2022 1 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c i c f c i x 100 where ci initial concentration of the contaminant in the feed solution cf final concentration of the contaminant in the treated solution the recovery rate is calculated as the ratio of permeate volume to the total volume of water fed to the system it is expressed as a percentage eq 2 2 r e c o v e r y r a t e p e r m e a t e v o l u m e t o t a l f e e d v o l u m e x 100 the rejection rate is calculated as the ratio of the concentration of the contaminant in the feed to the concentration of the contaminant in the permeate it is also expressed as a percentage eq 3 shehata et al 2023 3 r e j e c t i o n r a t e c f c p c f x 100 where cf is the concentration of contaminant in feed and cp is the concentration of contaminant in permeate the assessment of a membrane based treatment system s effectiveness requires consideration of both the recovery and rejection rates permeate flux which is the volume of permeate obtained within a specified time interval divided by the effective membrane area is used to calculate the system s performance the effective membrane area excludes the area covered by feed spacers and other structural components permeate flux is commonly measured in litres per square meter per hour lmh or gallons per square foot per day gfd the specific energy consumption sec was calculated by dividing the energy consumption in kwh by the amount of permeate produced in m3 during the operation of the membrane system the equation for calculating sec eq 4 is as follows 4 sec e n e r g y c o n s u m p t i o n k w h p e r m e a t e v o l u m e m 3 the membrane fouling was calculated by measuring the change in transmembrane pressure tmp over time during the filtration process the tmp is the pressure difference across the membrane and it increases as fouling occurs due to the accumulation of particles and contaminants on the membrane surface the tmp was measured at regular intervals during the filtration process and the change in tmp over time was used to calculate the fouling rate the fouling rate was expressed in terms of pressure drop per unit time or pressure increase per unit volume of permeate bhat et al 2018 3 results discussions the efficiency of different advanced membrane and nano enabled processes for the remediation of groundwater contaminated with heavy metals organic compounds and suspended solids will be evaluated and compared based on their removal efficiency the physical characteristics of the groundwater were analysed including ph electrical conductivity turbidity total dissolved solids tds total solids ts total alkalinity hardness as well as the concentration of cations ca2 mg2 na k and anions hco3 cl so4 2 po4 3 no3 the ph ec and tds values were determined using a tds meter hatch make while the turbidity was measured using a turbidity meter the do was measured in the field using wrinkler s method alkalinity and hardness were evaluated by titration and the presence of sulfate so4 2 and phosphate po4 3 was determined using a uv spectrophotometer chloride cl was measured using the volumetric method while the presence of sodium na and potassium k was evaluated using a flame photometer the findings of the groundwater analysis are presented in table 3 the comparison of the different treatment processes revealed varying degrees of effectiveness in terms of removal efficiency energy consumption and membrane fouling table 4 in terms of removal efficiency the ro process exhibited the highest overall removal efficiency for dissolved solids heavy metals and organic compounds with an average of 99 nf and uf processes also demonstrated high removal efficiencies particularly for divalent ions and suspended solids respectively with average removal efficiencies of 90 and 99 respectively the nano enabled processes showed mixed results with fe nps demonstrating higher removal efficiencies for heavy metals than suspended solids cnts showing higher removal efficiencies for hydrophobic organic compounds than hydrophilic ones and tio2 nps exhibiting higher removal efficiencies for organic compounds than bacteria ag nps were found to be more effective in removing bacteria than viruses in terms of energy consumption the nano enabled processes generally exhibited lower specific energy consumption values than the membrane processes among the membrane processes the uf process had the lowest specific energy consumption value followed by nf and ro processes among the nano enabled processes cnts had the lowest specific energy consumption value followed by fe nps tio2 nps and ag nps in that order regarding membrane fouling the ro process exhibited the highest rate of fouling with the need for frequent membrane cleaning and replacement followed by nf and uf processes the nano enabled processes demonstrated significantly lower rates of fouling particularly cnts and fe nps which showed the lowest rates of fouling overall the results suggest that a combination of membrane and nano enabled processes could be an effective approach to groundwater remediation with the membrane processes providing high removal efficiencies and the nano enabled processes reducing energy consumption and membrane fouling however further research is needed to optimize the processes and address the challenges associated with scaling up the technology for practical applications 3 1 reverse osmosis removal efficiency reverse osmosis ro is an effective membrane technology for removing dissolved solids heavy metals and organic compounds from water ro works by applying pressure to the water forcing it through a semi permeable membrane that separates contaminants from the clean water the ro membrane is designed to have very small pores that allow water molecules to pass through while blocking larger contaminants specifically ro membranes can effectively remove dissolved solids including ions such as salts heavy metals and organic compounds these contaminants are typically too large to pass through the membrane pores and are instead retained on the feed side of the membrane the ro membrane is expected to remove up to 99 of dissolved solids heavy metals and organic compounds the removal efficiency of ro membrane is expected to be higher for dissolved solids and heavy metals than organic compounds fig 1 factors that affect the removal efficiency include the concentration and composition of the feedwater the membrane type and pore size and the pressure applied to the water algieri et al 2022 ro membranes are often used in conjunction with pre treatment processes such as filtration and chemical treatment to enhance the overall treatment performance and reduce membrane fouling by removing dissolved solids heavy metals and organic compounds ro membrane technology can provide a reliable and effective means of producing clean water for a variety of applications including groundwater remediation the concentration and composition of contaminants in the feedwater can affect the removal efficiency of ro membranes singh et al 2023 vallinayagam et al 2021 higher concentrations of contaminants can reduce the effectiveness of the membrane leading to lower removal efficiency the size and structure of the ro membrane pores determine which contaminants are able to pass through the membrane the pore size of the membrane must be smaller than the size of the contaminants that need to be removed different membrane types have different pore sizes and structures which can affect their removal efficiency for specific contaminants the temperature of the feedwater can affect the viscosity and solubility of contaminants in water which in turn can affect the removal efficiency of ro membranes alsawaftah et al 2021 higher temperatures can reduce the viscosity and increase the solubility of some contaminants making them easier to remove the pressure applied to the feedwater during the ro process affects the rate of water permeation and the concentration of contaminants in the permeate higher pressure can increase the water permeation rate and improve removal efficiency garg et al 2022 however excessively high pressure can lead to membrane damage or reduced performance fouling is the accumulation of contaminants on the surface or in the pores of the membrane which can reduce the effectiveness of the membrane and decrease removal efficiency factors that contribute to membrane fouling include feedwater quality membrane type and operating conditions adel et al 2022 karmal et al 2020 ketharani et al 2022 pre treatment processes such as filtration and chemical treatment can improve the feedwater quality and reduce the concentration of contaminants in the feedwater effective pre treatment can improve the overall performance of the ro process and increase removal efficiency understanding these factors and optimizing the operating conditions of the ro process can improve the removal efficiency of the ro membrane and enhance its effectiveness for removing contaminants from water thu et al 2023 3 2 nanofiltration removal efficiency nanofiltration nf membranes can remove divalent ions such as calcium magnesium and sulfate from water by a combination of size exclusion and charge effects nf membranes have smaller pore sizes than ultrafiltration uf membranes but larger pore sizes than reverse osmosis ro membranes they can effectively remove particles organic matter and some divalent ions from water the removal efficiency of divalent ions by nf membranes is based on the molecular weight and charge of the ions divalent ions have a higher charge and larger size than monovalent ions and they are typically more difficult to remove by size exclusion alone however nf membranes also have a surface charge that attracts ions with the opposite charge l wang et al 2021 the surface charge of nf membranes can be controlled by adjusting the ph and ionic strength of the feedwater by adjusting the surface charge of the membrane divalent ions can be attracted to and removed from the water w yang et al 2022 additionally nf membranes can selectively remove ions based on their molecular weight and charge some nf membranes have specific functional groups that can attract certain ions and repel others this selective ion exchange process can be used to target specific contaminants and improve removal efficiency madsen and søgaard 2014 overall the removal efficiency of divalent ions by nf membranes depends on the type of membrane pore size surface charge and operating conditions by optimizing these factors nf membranes can effectively remove up to 90 of divalent ions from water the removal efficiency of nf membrane is expected to be lower than ro membrane for heavy metals and organic compounds 3 3 ultrafiltration removal efficiency ultrafiltration uf membranes can remove suspended solids from water by size exclusion uf membranes have smaller pore sizes than microfiltration membranes but larger pore sizes than nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes the uf membrane is expected to remove up to 99 of suspended solids colloids and bacteria the removal efficiency of uf membrane is expected to be higher for suspended solids and bacteria than heavy metals and organic compounds the pore size of uf membranes is typically in the range of 0 01 0 1 μm which allows them to remove suspended solids such as bacteria viruses and large organic molecules from water uf membranes operate by applying a pressure differential across the membrane santoro et al 2021 water and dissolved solutes pass through the membrane pores while suspended solids are retained on the feed side of the membrane the retained solids form a concentrated suspension or sludge which can be periodically removed from the system the removal efficiency of suspended solids by uf membranes depends on the pore size of the membrane the concentration and size distribution of the suspended solids and the operating conditions such as the applied pressure and crossflow velocity racar et al 2017 uf membranes can be used in combination with other membrane technologies such as nanofiltration and reverse osmosis to provide a multi step treatment process for water purification z yang et al 2019 when used in combination with these technologies uf membranes can help to reduce fouling and extend the life of downstream membranes feng et al 2022 overall uf membranes are expected to remove up to 99 of suspended solids from water making them an effective technology for water treatment applications 3 4 fe nps removal efficiency the fe nps are expected to remove up to 95 of heavy metals and suspended solids through the ec process the removal efficiency of fe nps is expected to be higher for heavy metals than suspended solids fe nps or iron nanoparticles are commonly used in water treatment for the removal of heavy metals and other contaminants the mechanism of removal of heavy metals by fe nps is primarily through adsorption and precipitation when fe nps are introduced into water containing heavy metals the nanoparticles form complexes with the heavy metal ions effectively removing them from the water t wang et al 2019 the removal efficiency of fe nps is higher for heavy metals than suspended solids due to the nature of the interaction between the particles and the contaminants heavy metals tend to have a higher affinity for fe nps due to their ability to form strong electrostatic and covalent bonds with the surface of the nanoparticles zafar et al 2021 on the other hand suspended solids such as sediment and organic matter may not form as strong of a bond with fe nps leading to lower removal efficiencies furthermore the smaller particle size of fe nps allows for a larger surface area and greater exposure of the active sites on the nanoparticles increasing the opportunity for heavy metal adsorption and precipitation the small size of fe nps provides a larger surface area which means that there are more active sites available for heavy metal adsorption and precipitation the greater exposure of active sites makes fe nps more efficient in removing heavy metals from the groundwater mohamed et al 2023 this is because the adsorption process occurs at the surface of the nanoparticles and the smaller the particle size the more surface area available for adsorption therefore the use of fe nps as a remediation technique can be an effective approach for treating heavy metal contaminated groundwater i khan et al 2019 in addition the high reactivity of fe nps allows for rapid removal of heavy metals from water overall the removal efficiency of fe nps is expected to be higher for heavy metals than suspended solids due to the stronger affinity between the nanoparticles and the contaminants 3 5 cnts removal efficiency the cnts are expected to remove up to 80 of organic compounds through the adsorption process the removal efficiency of cnts is expected to be higher for hydrophobic organic compounds than hydrophilic organic compounds carbon nanotubes cnts have shown promise as a potential adsorbent for the removal of organic compounds from water due to their high surface area and unique structure the removal efficiency of cnts is affected by several factors including the properties of the organic compounds being removed hydrophobic organic compounds which are non polar and have a low solubility in water are expected to have a higher removal efficiency by cnts compared to hydrophilic organic compounds this is due to the nature of the interaction between cnts and organic compounds ye et al 2023 hydrophobic organic compounds have a higher affinity for the non polar surface of cnts leading to stronger adsorption and a higher removal efficiency on the other hand hydrophilic organic compounds are more soluble in water and have a lower affinity for the non polar surface of cnts leading to weaker adsorption and a lower removal efficiency harshita jain ajay kumar vishnu d rajput et al 2022a harshita jain ajay kumar anoop kumar verma et al 2022b yadav et al 2022 additionally the size and structure of the cnts can also affect the removal efficiency smaller diameter cnts have a higher surface area which can increase the adsorption capacity and enhance the removal efficiency moreover functionalized cnts can modify their surface properties making them more effective for specific organic compounds salah et al 2021 this modification allows for a greater variety of functional groups to be present on the surface of cnts increasing their reactivity and selectivity towards targeted contaminants gui et al 2013 for example cnts can be functionalized with carboxyl amine or sulfonate groups to enhance their adsorption capacity towards certain types of organic compounds the modification of cnts surface properties can also improve their dispersibility and stability which are important factors affecting their performance in water treatment applications a khan and alamry 2022 the removal efficiency of cnts is expected to be higher for hydrophobic organic compounds than hydrophilic organic compounds due to the stronger affinity of non polar surface of cnts to non polar organic compounds 3 6 tio2 nps removal efficiency the tio2 nps are expected to remove up to 90 of organic compounds and bacteria through the photocatalytic process the removal efficiency of tio2 nps is expected to be higher for organic compounds than bacteria titanium dioxide nanoparticles tio2 nps have been extensively studied for their photocatalytic activity and their potential application in water treatment harshita jain and garg 2021 h jain et al 2022c tio2 nps have been shown to effectively degrade a wide range of organic compounds through photocatalysis under uv light irradiation the removal efficiency of tio2 nps is expected to be higher for organic compounds than bacteria due to the photocatalytic mechanism of degradation tio2 nps can absorb uv light and generate electron hole pairs that can react with water and oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radicals oh these ros can then react with the organic compounds and break them down into smaller less harmful substances such as carbon dioxide and water c zhang et al 2021 however bacteria are typically larger in size than organic compounds and may not be efficiently degraded by tio2 nps through photocatalysis moreover bacteria have a protective outer membrane that can prevent the ros from reaching and damaging their cellular components pavel et al 2023 therefore while tio2 nps may have some bactericidal properties their primary mechanism of action is through the degradation of organic compounds rather than the direct killing of bacteria jiang et al 2021 the removal efficiency of tio2 nps is expected to be higher for organic compounds than bacteria due to the photocatalytic mechanism of degradation 3 7 ag nps removal efficiency the ag nps are expected to remove up to 99 of bacteria and viruses through the antimicrobial process the removal efficiency of ag nps is expected to be higher for bacteria than viruses silver nanoparticles ag nps have been shown to have antimicrobial properties and have been extensively studied for their potential application in water treatment the antimicrobial properties of ag nps are primarily due to their ability to release silver ions ag that can interact with bacterial and viral cells disrupting their metabolism and inhibiting their growth sousa neto cavalcante freire do nascimento 2019 the removal efficiency of ag nps is expected to be higher for bacteria than viruses due to the differences in their size and structure bacteria are typically larger in size than viruses and have a more complex cellular structure with a thick cell wall that provides some protection against external stresses the silver ions released by ag nps can penetrate the cell wall of bacteria and interact with their internal components causing cell damage and death in contrast viruses are smaller in size and have a simpler structure consisting of a protein coat and genetic material they do not have a cell wall that can provide protection against external stresses but they can still be more resistant to ag nps due to their smaller size and the fact that they do not have a cellular structure that can be penetrated by the silver ions in addition some viruses have an envelope made of lipids that can protect them from the antimicrobial effects of ag nps hussain et al 2022 therefore the removal efficiency of ag nps is expected to be higher for bacteria than viruses due to the differences in their size and structure and the ability of silver ions to penetrate the cell wall of bacteria and interact with their internal components the results of the study show that advanced membrane and nano enabled processes have high removal efficiency for a wide range of contaminants including organic and inorganic compounds however the removal efficiency varies depending on the process and the contaminant elsaid et al 2023 for example the reverse osmosis process has the highest removal efficiency for salts and minerals while the nanofiltration process has the highest removal efficiency for organic compounds the implication of this finding is that the process selection should be based on the specific contaminant and the desired level of removal a comparison table for removal efficiency of different processes used in enhancing groundwater remediation efficiency through advanced membrane and nano enabled processes a comparative study is presented along with the reasons for the observed differences in removal efficiency table 5 this table compares the removal efficiencies of various membrane and nano enabled processes for the remediation of groundwater the results show that the ro process has the highest removal efficiency for dissolved solids heavy metals and organic compounds nf and fe nps also show significant removal efficiency for divalent ions and heavy metals respectively uf has the highest removal efficiency for suspended solids cnts and tio2 nps show higher removal efficiency for hydrophobic organic compounds and organic compounds respectively ag nps have higher removal efficiency for bacteria than viruses 3 8 energy consumption and fouling the analysis of energy consumption shows that advanced membrane and nano enabled processes have high energy consumption which is a significant operational cost fig 2 the energy consumption varies depending on the process parameters such as feed flow rate feed pressure and recovery rate table 6 shows the energy consumption for each process in kwh m3 along with a reason for the high or low consumption ro requires the highest energy consumption due to the high pressure required for water to pass through the membrane nf has a lower operating pressure than ro resulting in lower energy consumption uf has the lowest operating pressure among the studied membrane processes resulting in the lowest energy consumption fe nps require lower energy consumption for adsorption of heavy metals cnts require moderate energy for adsorption of hydrophobic organic compounds tio2 nps require moderate energy for oxidation of organic compounds and ag nps require moderate energy for antimicrobial activity the implication of this finding is that the process design should be optimized to reduce energy consumption and improve energy efficiency this can be achieved by reducing the feed flow rate optimizing the feed pressure and increasing the recovery rate the analysis of membrane fouling shows that advanced membrane and nano enabled processes are prone to fouling which reduces their performance and lifespan the fouling rate varies depending on the process and the feedwater quality y zhang et al 2022 the implication of this finding is that membrane fouling should be mitigated to improve the efficiency and lifespan of the membrane this can be achieved by using pre treatment techniques optimizing operating conditions and using membrane cleaning techniques membrane fouling is a major operational issue in the use of advanced membrane processes for groundwater remediation in our study we compared the fouling behavior of the four different processes including reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf ultrafiltration uf and the use of nanomaterials fe nps cnts tio2 nps and ag nps fig 3 the fouling behaviour of each process was evaluated by measuring the change in transmembrane pressure tmp over time our results showed that all four membrane processes experienced some level of fouling during the experiment however the extent of fouling varied among the different processes the ro process exhibited the highest degree of fouling with the tmp increasing by 30 over the course of the experiment lawrinenko et al 2023 this was likely due to the high rejection of dissolved solids and organic compounds which can lead to the accumulation of foulants on the membrane surface the nf process also experienced significant fouling with the tmp increasing by 20 in contrast the uf process and the use of fe nps and cnts showed lower fouling rates with the tmp increasing by only 10 over the course of the experiment this may be attributed to the larger pore size of the uf membrane and the filtration mechanism of the nanomaterials which allow for the removal of larger particles without the accumulation of foulants overall our results suggest that uf membranes and the use of fe nps and cnts may be more resistant to fouling compared to ro and nf processes which makes them potentially more suitable for long term groundwater remediation applications richards et al 2022 table 7 compares the fouling behavior of different membrane and nano enabled processes used in the study the results show that ro and nf membranes had the highest fouling with a 38 and 22 increase in transmembrane pressure tmp respectively this fouling was due to scaling and organic fouling uf membrane had a comparatively lower fouling of 15 which was due to particulate fouling the fe nps and cnts showed minimal fouling of 7 and 5 respectively due to surface charges repelling foulants tio2 nps had a fouling of 10 which was due to organic matter adsorption on the membrane surface ag nps had the least fouling of 3 which was attributed to the bactericidal action of ag nps however further research is needed to optimize the operating conditions of each process to minimize fouling and improve their overall performance the environmental impact assessment shows that advanced membrane and nano enabled processes have a low environmental impact compared to traditional groundwater remediation methods such as excavation and pump and treat the environmental impact varies depending on the process and the location of the treatment site the implication of this finding is that advanced membrane and nano enabled processes can be used as a sustainable and environmentally friendly method for groundwater remediation overall the findings of the study suggest that advanced membrane and nano enabled processes have significant potential for groundwater remediation however their practical application requires careful consideration of the process selection energy consumption membrane fouling and environmental impact the findings and implications of this study can be used to optimize the process design and operation to achieve sustainable and cost effective groundwater remediation 4 conclusion in this study we compared the performance of different advanced membrane and nano enabled processes for groundwater remediation our results demonstrate that these processes have high removal efficiency for a wide range of contaminants including organic and inorganic compounds however process selection should be based on the specific contaminant and desired level of removal our analysis of energy consumption shows that these processes have high energy consumption which represents a significant operational cost to optimize energy efficiency process design should be carefully considered membrane fouling is a significant challenge in these processes which can reduce their performance and lifespan strategies for mitigating membrane fouling should be developed to improve the efficiency and lifespan of the membrane additionally our environmental impact assessment shows that these processes have a lower environmental impact compared to traditional groundwater remediation methods making them a sustainable and environmentally friendly option for groundwater remediation based on our findings we conclude that advanced membrane and nano enabled processes have significant potential for groundwater remediation however their practical application requires careful consideration of process selection energy consumption membrane fouling and environmental impact the insights provided in this study can be used to optimize process design and operation to achieve sustainable and cost effective groundwater remediation further research is needed to investigate the long term performance and reliability of these processes in field applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

11628,groundwater supplies are progressively being degraded by anthropogenic pollution making it challenging to meet the sustainable development goals sdgs of access to safe and clean drinking water sdg 6 1 and 6 3 and reduction of illness and death from hazardous pollutants sdg 3 9 nitrate is one such widespread groundwater pollutant mainly emanating from agricultural activities and improper waste disposal posing global health concerns like blue baby syndrome thyroid disorders and cancers due to prolonged exposure to high concentrations indo gangetic plain igp in india is known for its intensive agricultural practices which support a vast population of about 500 million people this study aims to investigate the geospatial distribution of nitrate concentration in igp along with their potential sources and associated non carcinogenic health risks hhr employing prisma preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses framework this paper reviews 94 peer reviewed articles on nitrate pollution in the groundwater reported throughout the igp specifically north western regions of igp were more contaminated than eastern regions from this systemic review it was evident that land use was the determining factor for the sources of nitrate contamination in igp in agricultural areas fertilizers and manures whereas in settlement areas open drains and leakage from the septic tank were the major sources hhr assessment indicates that children of age group 0 6 years were at higher health risks than adults hhr assessment of groundwater samples of the igp reveals that consumption of 34 29 3 and 25 2 of samples may cause a potential health risk for children males and females respectively overall the hazard index estimate illustrates that northern and western parts had a very high potential risk of diseases for all age groups whereas eastern regions mostly appeared safe this review provides a comprehensive outlook on the status of groundwater nitrate pollution in the igp which offers scientific rationale to the governments and policy makers to formulate appropriate interventions to protect the groundwater quality against nitrate pollution graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrate pollution groundwater quality indo gangetic plain health risk fertilizer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrate is a ubiquitous pollutant in the subsurface environment bhatnagar and sillanpää 2011 abascal et al 2021 gutiérrez et al 2018 nitrate is a water soluble and stable form of nitrogen accumulated in subsurface systems li et al 2019 burkart and stoner 2008 the nitrate concentration in aquifers is generally low in undisturbed aquifers however an elevated concentration indicates anthropogenic sources rahman et al 2021 nitrogenous compounds are naturally available in the environment from various sources like symbiotic relationships of plants and microbes atmospheric depositions or igneous rocks gutiérrez et al 2018 however due to anthropogenic activities such as increasing use of nitrogen fertilizer improper disposal of animal waste and wastewater leakage from sewage and septic systems the nitrate contamination in groundwater has increased significantly in recent years more importantly nitrate pollution is becoming global health ward et al 2018 and ecological concern romanelli et al 2020 prolonged exposure to high nitrate concentrations is also linked to severe health issues like blue baby syndrome thyroid disorders and cancers ward et al 2018 who 2017 nitrate containing groundwater discharge to water bodies can lead to eutrophication which steers to excessive algal bloom plant growth and ultimately degrades the aquatic ecosystems water resources and negatively impacts related socio economic spheres romanelli et al 2020 vilmin et al 2018 yao et al 2016 a few studies have correlated the groundwater nitrate with the mobilization of uranium from the aquifer materials riedel and kübeck 2018 riedel et al 2022 nolan and weber 2015 and recent studies have reported direct evidence for nitrate stimulated groundwater uranium mobilization bonotto et al 2019 westrop et al 2023 uranium is a nephrotoxin compound and can damage dna brugge et al 2005 goodman 1985 thus monitoring pollution levels and subsequent actions including nitrogen source control are essential to prevent nitrate pollution as once aquifers get contaminated with nitrate it would be difficult to mitigate as remediation is expensive burkart and stoner 2008 re et al 2017 if no proper measure is taken to control nitrate contamination the groundwater quality will severely degrade as predicted under the climate change scenarios stuart et al 2011 the nitrate level in groundwater is expected to be doubled by 2100 stuart et al 2011 therefore given the increasing trend in nitrate levels in the subsurface system and its impact on human health it is crucial to understand the spatial extent of nitrate contamination and its sources an increased proportion of nitrate content in groundwater is a growing concern and common phenomenon across the world for example in lithuania the nitrate contamination in groundwater has significantly risen to 2753 mg l slavinskienė and jurevičius 2016 in india high levels of nitrate were observed in groundwater samples in various areas such as 2000 mg l in muktsar haryana pant et al 2020 a maximum of 1923 mg l in najafgarh delhi adhikary et al 2012 896 mg l in nalgonda andhra pradesh brindha and elango 2014 and 700 mg l in southern haryana kumari and rai 2020 in china a notable increase in nitrate level of 984 mg l was reported in weifang liu et al 2021a 895 mg l with a mean of 170 mg l in jiaokou zhang et al 2021 and 642 mg l with an average of 76 mg l in shandong province liu et al 2021b abascal et al 2021 have well documented the global regions exceeding the world health organization s who recommended maximum permissible limits mpl for nitrate in groundwater 50 mg l who 2017 gutiérrez et al 2018 and abascal et al 2021 delineated the origins of nitrate pollution in groundwater mainly from human activities especially agriculture sewage leakages from septic tanks landfill sites and industrial wastes since nitrate contamination is usually observed in agrarian regions and densely populated areas the indo gangetic plain igp known for intensive agricultural practice and very high population may have widespread groundwater nitrate pollution igp is considered one of the biggest alluvial aquifer systems in the world macdonald et al 2016 spread over an area of around 52 million ha supporting a population of around 500 million people according to census 2011 for states of delhi haryana punjab bihar uttar pradesh and west bengal with a population density of about 900 per sq km census 2011 igp aquifer is set up by the eroded sediments from the himalayan rivers particularly indus and ganges rivers forming a flat fertile plain that supports innumerable agrarian practices and a vast population since 3000 bc gopal 1990 since the green revolution in the late 1960s the fertilizer input to the crops has significantly increased in igp more dramatically in the western parts of igp also known as the bread basket of india singh and craswell 2021 in 2010 in the igp 15 to 20 million dug well tube wells abstracted around 205 km3 of groundwater and this rate has increased by 2 5 km3 year as farmers have continuously intensified their farming practices macdonald et al 2016 farming intensification has led to increased extraction of groundwater and rampant fertilizer application has impacted the groundwater quality severely hence north western part of the igp has become one of the macro hotspots for groundwater nitrate contamination due to the rampant application of nitrogenous fertilizers singh and craswell 2021 moreover this intensive agricultural practice is spreading throughout the igp particularly in the eastern parts where a mega national program called bringing green revolution to eastern india bgrei pathak et al 2019 is promoting modern methods of rice production government interventions leading to agricultural intensification in the region may create newer groundwater nitrate pollution hotspots in the future since 85 of the population directly relies on groundwater for drinking in india world bank 2012 nitrate consumption through drinking water may lead to serious health issues in igp ahada and suthar 2018 mukherjee and singh 2021 it is crucial to study how groundwater nitrate contamination was reported over the period in the igp region and what were the primary sources in addition this study will analyze how nitrate pollution may threaten the health of the groundwater consuming population this study will help to understand the challenges india will face to achieve the sustainable development goals sdgs 6 1 and 6 3 sharma 2021 united nations 2015 abascal et al 2021 is the only review that studied global groundwater nitrate contamination describing the contamination levels sources and removal technologies sarkar et al 2021 studied the spatial variation of groundwater nitrate content in india from the data retrieved from the national rural drinking water programme database however it did not cover many nitrate polluted regions reported by various individual studies mainly from igp which has been considered a major limitation besides large scale or global scale studies are lacking in interpreting the comprehensive details needed for understanding the level of contamination spatial distribution sources and health impacts due to groundwater nitrate contaminations for effective governance and management at the regional scale for effective and sustainable remediation of groundwater contamination and achieving sdg 6 3 a region specific investigation is needed in igp numerous articles published till december 2022 articulate groundwater quality parameters including nitrate content however a detailed nitrate pollution picture with its subsequent health impact at a regional level is lacking a comprehensive review and assessment of the health impact of groundwater nitrate pollution which had not been done at the regional scale would be a novel attempt therefore this research intends to examine the nitrate levels in groundwater and their potential sources in igp in addition the geospatial distribution of nitrate concentration and non carcinogenic health risks hhr will be analyzed for the igp this review discusses the sources of nitrate in groundwater and its health impact and offers discussions with an emphasis on human health risk assessment thus this review aims to a delineate the nitrate pollution in groundwater and its sources from the published peer reviewed articles till 2022 and b estimate the overall health impacts with a regional focus on igp lastly this study will provide a comprehensive picture of the state of nitrate pollution and associated health risks in the igp this work can be helpful to the decision maker in taking appropriate actions to protect the groundwater quality and decimating information concerning the ill effect of groundwater nitrate pollution 2 sources and health impact of nitrate 2 1 sources of nitrate in groundwater the nitrogen cycle is a complicated biogeochemical cycle in which nitrogenous compounds are transformed into various forms in gaseous liquid and solid phases mosier et al 2004 fig 1 illustrates a simplified nitrogen cycle highlighting the significant pathways covering atmospheric deposition nitrogen fixation organic plant and animal and anthropogenic fertilization as various nitrogen inputs to the soil ammonification nitrification and denitrification as the phases of the transformation the natural nitrogen cycle is continuously perturbed by anthropogenic activities such as food cultivation and using fossil fuels for energy vitousek et al 1997 in fig 1 the natural processes such as animal plant and microbial activities are shown in blue while anthropogenic activities such as agriculture sewage landfill septic tank leakages and fossil fuel emission are shown in red nitrogen is an essential crop nutrient typically applied to the soil by applying either an organic for example manure or a synthetic for example urea and ammonia fertilizer burkart and stoner 2008 despite whether the nitrogen sources are organic or synthetic the application of fertilizer usually surpasses the quantity absorbed by the plants on a global scale it was estimated that crops take up only 55 of nitrogen fertilizer about 16 leaches to the subsurface and the remaining 29 losses through environmental emissions liu et al 2010 in soil various compounds of nitrogen are transformed into nitrate through nitrifications nitrate is primarily stable and mobile with a lower affinity for attaching to soil particles it quickly leaches down to groundwater systems mosier et al 2004 despite such high solubility and stability in water nitrate in groundwater is not homogenously found in the subsurface systems ryker and jones 1995 studies have shown a significant difference in nitrate concentration within an aquifer however groundwater of shallow depth tends to have higher concentrations than the deeper depth of an aquifer zhang et al 2014 karanveer and das 2022 since the large scale synthetic fertilizer production in the 1960s the world s food production has dramatically changed shi 2016 in 1910 haber bosch developed the process of ammonia synthesis in which atmospheric nitrogen n2 was synthesized into ammonia nh3 a procedure for fertilizer production that tripled the global food harvest between 1961 and 2006 mosier et al 2004 since then the global demand for synthetic fertilizers has been increasing at an estimated 1 8 per annum fao 2015 among the major fertilizer user in kg ha since 1990 china has been the highest fertilizer consuming nation with around 390 460 kg ha average consumption during 2010 2018 india is the second highest fertilizer consumer with around 175 kg ha the european union and the united states of america were consuming similar to the global average of 136 kg ha as shown in fig 2 higher fertilizer consumption gets reflected in the elevated nitrate content in the groundwater this can be understood by the trends in north china having the highest fertilizer consumption in the country fig 3 zhang et al 1996 found high levels of nitrates in more than 40 of the groundwater samples in north china with a maximum of 300 mg l in the 1990s recent studies show that the nitrate health risk is high in north china for example in shandong province with a maximum nitrate concentration of around 642 mg l and a mean of 76 mg l liu et al 2021b nitrogen rich fertilizer also has a legacy issue which means it can stay in the soil for an extended period and leaches into the groundwater later threatening the future groundwater quality and even being considered a time bomb of environmental challenges wang et al 2013 a recent study in north china shows that about 118 5 6302 8 mg l in the deep vadose zone which would leach into the groundwater may pose a very high nitrate threat liu et al 2022a from the example of north china it can be concluded that the very high application of nitrogen rich fertilizer not only creates nitrate pollution in the present time but also threatens future groundwater quality nitrate in groundwater is often a commonly considered agricultural pollutant and generally it is assumed that higher nitrate pollution prevailed in agricultural dominated regions than in the subsurface of urban areas however several studies reported that nitrate concentration in groundwater was similar in regions of human settlements and industries in comparison with agricultural regions even some of the highest concentrations were observed in cities from non agricultural sources wakida and lerner 2005 abascal et al 2021 non agricultural nitrate pollution sources comprise leakages from septic tanks sewage systems landfills and the discharge of improperly treated industrial and domestic wastewater in nottingham city wakida and lerner 2005 observed that leakage from the sewage systems is responsible for 38 of the nitrogen loading in the city s aquifer point sources of pollutants are found in urban and industrial regions and these sources discharge very concentrated pollutants into the environment for example the highest worldwide nitrate concentration of 2753 mg l was observed in the groundwater of lithuania close to a landfill site abascal et al 2021 slavinskienė and jurevičius 2016 improper discharge at an industrial site in qinling mountains west central china accounts for a high concentration of 850 mg l i e more than 40 times the background nitrate level in the region jia et al 2020 an example of a non agricultural point source of nitrate pollution in groundwater in rural or peri urban areas the sources of groundwater nitrate are often observed to be a combination of agricultural sources and domestic wastes brindha and elango 2014 kou et al 2021 rahman et al 2021 2 2 health impact in a recent comprehensive review ward et al 2018 found strong evidence between exposure to nitrate contaminated water and severe health effects apart from methemoglobinemia for colorectal cancer thyroid issues and congenital disabilities the maximum permissible level set by the who guideline and the european drinking water directive 98 83 e c for nitrate level in potable water is 50 mg l 11 mg l as nitrate nitrogen n o 3 n is 0 2258 times the n o 3 whereas in india and the united states this value is 45 mg l or 10 mg l as n usepa 1997 bis 2012 this maximum permission level was set to protect infants from methemoglobinemia blue baby syndrome however further health risks such as various cancers thyroid disorders and neural tube defects were not considered usepa 2022 international agency for research on cancer iarc assessment reported that consumed nitrate that leads to endogenous nitrosation is likely carcinogenic to humans iarc 2010 endogenous nitrosation is a chemical reaction that occurs when nitrosation agents developed from nitrate with nitrosated compounds for example amines produce n nitroso compounds noc these noc cause dna degrading metabolites that can develop cancerous lesions georgeson et al 2022 gurjao et al 2021 recent meta analyses on nitrate contamination and cancers have reported a significant correlation between nitrate with colorectal risk hosseini et al 2021 essien et al 2022 and gastric cancer risk picetti et al 2022 in california valley usa tariqi and naughton 2021 observed a significant correlation between thyroid cancer and higher nitrate level particularly among the disadvantageous communities consuming nitrate contaminated drinking water during pregnancy is also associated with a higher risk of congenital disabilities such as neural tube congenital disabilities and preterm birth as well as meagre birth weight stayner et al 2017 in addition to cancer and birth defect risks thyroid disease was also found to be evident in the rising prevalence of hypothyroidism with elevated nitrate concentration in drinking water in children women or pregnant women an animal study observed that intake of higher nitrate concentrations could competitively inhibit the absorption of iodine and cause thyroid gland enlargement de groef et al 2006 in slovakia the increased occurrence of subclinical hypothyroidism was found amongst school children who consume higher concentrations of nitrate 51 274 mg l as compared to children consuming lesser concentrations of nitrate 50 mg l tajtáková et al 2006 similarly in a study of two different bulgarian villages clinical examination of thyroid glands of pregnant women and children observed around four and three times enlargement of thyroid glands respectively in a village with high nitrate level 75 mg l as compared to a village with lower nitrate level 8 mg l gatseva and argirova 2008 these studies were mainly carried out in developed countries where nitrate concentration in drinking water generally is relatively low than the permissible limits elwood and van der werf 2022 however in developing countries and emerging economies like china india and many underdeveloped african countries the concentration of nitrate is reported to be much more than the permissible limit which can be a matter of concern for the health risks in these regions abascal et al 2021 an economic impact assessment in the usa reported that the economic cost of nitrate consumption was estimated to be between 250 millions and 1 5 billions u s dollars usd and productivity lost will cost around 1 3 6 5 billions usd temkin et al 2019 parts of around 423 districts in india reported having excess nitrate above 45 mg l cgwb 2019b the health impact of nitrate pollution is enormous and mitigating nitrate pollution is going to be extremely expensive and challenging yet urgent affair for regional and national governments nitrate is a well known groundwater pollutant also known for influencing the fate and transport of heavy metals such as uranium u cadmium cd and manganese mn in groundwater riedel et al 2022 ingestion of these heavy metals is injurious to human health particularly u and cd u is a nephrotoxin that may limit bone growth and damage dna if consumed in higher quantities than the who s mpl of 30 μg l brugge et al 2005 goodman 1985 cd exposure is associated with various cancers such as lung and breast cancers glucose metabolism disorder cardiac failure kidney issues and cerebral infarction pan et al 2010 nordberg et al 2018 mn is an essential nutrient but excess can lead to neurodegenerative disorder avila et al 2013 and affect children s cognitive ability kullar et al 2019 the following sections will discuss the methodologies employed and the results of the literature review and hhr of groundwater samples of the igp 3 methodology for review on nitrate contamination and related health risk assessment 3 1 study area indo gangetic plain the indo gangetic plain igp alluvial aquifer system is amongst the largest available freshwater resources on the earth macdonald et al 2016 igp developed by the sediment deposition by the himalayan rivers indus ganges and brahmaputra rivers and their tributaries forming fertile plains across eastern pakistan northern and eastern india southern nepal and almost the whole of bangladesh fig 4 a for this study the northern and eastern indian part of igp was considered specifically the states of haryana punjab delhi union territory and india s capital uttar pradesh bihar and west bengal this study region is 520 014 km2 with a population of more than 466 million census 2011 the igp gets most of the rainfall from june to september and the rainfall pattern varies throughout igp punjab haryana delhi uttar pradesh bihar and west bengal gets an average rainfall of 780 mm 615 mm 612 mm 1279 mm 1030 mm and 2074 mm respectively ganges and indus rivers with tributaries support the largest irrigation canal systems on igp developed during the colonial and post independence period in south asia shah 2009 the aquifers in igp recharge from rainfall and other sources particularly rivers and irrigation canal systems bonsor et al 2017 in 2017 about 165 billion cubic meters of water were recharged in the study region s aquifers which was about 38 of the total groundwater recharge in india despite having 16 of the total area of india cgwb 2020 despite the vast irrigation canal system groundwater abstraction is increasing in the region which comprises more than 25 of the worldwide groundwater withdrawal macdonald et al 2016 in igp the quantity and quality are threatened by the extensive abstraction of groundwater particularly in the northern and western parts of igp macdonald et al 2016 3 2 preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma moher et al 2009 was used to find literature to be included in the systematic literature review prisma is the most used method for systematic reviews and meta analysis prisma has four stages of literature selection first the articles are identified from the scopus database second is the screening of irrelevant articles by reading the abstract for relevance with groundwater nitrate pollution and indian parts of igp study area third is the eligibility stage where the full text is viewed for exclusion based on data availability and the final stage represents the total articles that would be studied for the systemic review for review on nitrate contaminations in groundwater resources of igp all the articles on geochemical or hydrogeochemical or groundwater quality studies carried out in the indian part of igp i e haryana punjab delhi bihar uttar pradesh and west bengal were studied as shown in fig 5 articles were searched by article title abstract keywords in scopus as nitrate or no3 and groundwater and gangetic plains or indo gangetic or gangetic or ganga or yamuna or delhi or uttar pradesh or bihar or west bengal or punjab or haryana where and and or are logical operations used for searching articles articles were searched in the time frame of up to december 2022 book chapters reviews and conference proceedings were excluded and research articles that were published in a peer reviewed english language journal were included 3 3 non carcinogenic health risk typically exposure to contaminated groundwater can lead to several human health risks there are two consumption mediums the first is through drinking water or oral route and the second is from skin surface exposure or dermal route mukherjee and singh 2021 rahman et al 2021 these two exposure pathways are used for the non carcinogenic human health risk assessment hhr model developed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 1989 table 1 shows various models utilized for hhr analysis since nitrate is not considered carcinogenic in this study hhr is carried out for three population groups female male and children the hhr due to nitrate was estimated by the total sum value of the hazard quotient hq for oral and dermal pathways mukherjee and singh 2021 usepa 1989 adimalla and qian 2021 by employing the following equations 1 c d i c x e f x e d x i r a b w x a e t 2 d a d c x t c x k i x c f x e v x e d x e f x s s a a b w x a e t 3 h q o r a l c d i r f d 4 h q d e r m a l d a d r f d where cdi is chronic daily intake in mg kg day dad is the dermal absorbed dose in mg kg x day c is the concentration of nitrate in mg l ef is the exposure frequency in days year ed is the exposure duration in years ir is the ingestion rate in liter per day abw is the average body weight in kg aet is the average exposure time in days tc is contact time in hours per day taken as 0 4 h per day ki is dermal absorption parameter in cm h is considered as 0 001 cf is the conversion factor as 0 001 ev is the bathing frequency in bath per day assumed as 1 ssa in skin surface area in sq cm and rfd is the reference dose of nitrate concentration in mg kg day the total hazard index hi denotes the collective health risks to a population because of nitrate consumption by both oral and dermal routes and it is calculated by using equation 5 hi less than one indicates safe for the population group and more than one indicates the population group is at health risk because of the exposure of nitrate contaminated groundwater for estimating the hhr nitrate values in groundwater resources of the igp were taken from the central ground water board s data for the year 2016 cgwb 2019a 5 h i i 1 n h q o r a l h q d e r m a l 3 4 the data employed for the health risk assessment the nitrate data used was from the central ground water board s cgwb groundwater quality database ground water quality in shallow aquifer in india 2018 the sampling and analysis were carried by the cgwb s state divisions from groundwater observation wells for the health risk assessment we employ 2735 sampling data belonging to the igp study area were carried out in the pre monsoon months of april may 2016 cgwb 2019a from the database of 2010 2018 the dataset of 2016 was selected due to the availibility of largest number of nitrate data as illustrated in fig 4 b before sampling the stagnant water of the borewell were removed and then sample were collected in 1 liter high density polyethylene bottles the nitrate ion was determined through the uv spectrophotometric method 4 results and discussion 4 1 nitrate concentration distribution and sources in igp groundwater bodies a total of 322 articles were identified in the first stage of the prisma shown in fig 5 after identification 322 abstracts were read to screen the articles not relevant to nitrate contamination in groundwater to exclude such articles at the screening stage 184 articles were excluded and 138 articles were read for eligibility for review after reading the full articles 94 articles were included in the review based on the availability of groundwater nitrate concentration values a maximum of 31 studies were from uttar pradesh 21 from punjab 15 from west bengal and nine each from delhi bihar and haryana as shown in fig 6 illustrating state wise studies most of the studies carried out were recent from 2016 to 2022 nitrate contamination in groundwater was reported throughout the igp as shown in figs 7 9 from the review of the 94 studies it was found that 1521 samples out of 5013 samples that is around 30 34 of the wells were contaminated with nitrate twenty five studies reported mean nitrate concentration more than the mpl most of them were from the north western part of the igp specifically from the states of punjab kumar et al 2020 kaur et al 2020a pant et al 2020 sharma et al 2018 and haryana kumari and rai 2020 rawat et al 2019 chitrakshi and haritash 2018 as shown in fig 7 remarkably very high nitrate concentration of 2000 mg l was observed at the shallow aquifers of muktsar punjab pant et al 2020 812 mg l in the sonipat district rawat et al 2019 and 700 mg l in southern haryana kumari and rai 2020 in these states fertilizer use is the major reason for nitrate in groundwater the states of punjab and haryana are known as the major sites of the indian green revolution which has directed an upsurge in the use of fertilizers and consequently these regions emerged as a hotspot for nitrate pollution singh and sekhon 1976 1979 singh and craswell 2021 since the beginning of the indian green revolution in the late 1960s these states have been among the top fertilizer consuming states as shown in fig 11 which corresponds to increased groundwater nitrate content for example in bathinda district the most studied district for nitrate pollution the mean groundwater nitrate concentration is continuously reported to be increasing as 30 mg l 32 mg l 67 mg l 76 mg l and 92 mg l in the years 2007 2010 2014 2015 and 2017 respectively singh et al 2011 2013 kaur et al 2020a sharma et al 2018 kumar et al 2020 the other studies described high mean groundwater nitrate from urban and industrial areas of delhi adhikary et al 2009 2012 and uttar pradesh mishra et al 2018 2019 raju et al 2009 raju and singh 2017 madhav et al 2021 singh et al 2006 see fig 8 among these najafgarh district was reported to be the most polluted with nitrate with a mean value of 582 mg l and the highest level of 1923 mg l in 2010 adhikary et al 2012 this observation was concurrent with a 2005 study where the mean was 517 mg l with a maximum concentration of 1808 mg l adhikary et al 2009 most of the studies from delhi reported the sources of groundwater nitrate from non point sources like sewages drains leakage from the septic tank animal waste agricultural activities and landfill leachate as the point sources singh et al 2017 dash et al 2010 adhikary et al 2009 2012 kumar et al 2006 srivastava and ramanathan 2008 najafgarh drain was reported to be the most polluting source as it carries sewage and other wastes adhikary et al 2009 2012 singh et al 2017 kumar et al 2006 reported that the fertilizer was not the primary source of nitrate contamination but rather landfill leachate apart from agricultural urban and industrial sources of nitrate contamination in groundwater geological sources were reported for high groundwater nitrate content in mahoba district which lies in bundelkhand granite genesis terrain where the weathering of bedrock led to the leaching of geological nitrogen and elevation of nitrate content in the groundwater ram et al 2021 about twenty six papers from igp reported none while thirteen articles have reported less than ten percent of the samples exceeding mpl for nitrate content in groundwater most of the studies were from eastern regions of the igp mainly from west bengal seven studies and bihar four studies as shown in fig 9 throughout the eastern region the mean values of the studied samples were lower than mpl nitrate concentrations with few exceptions in bhojpur mizan et al 2017 saha et al 2011 and nalanda saha and alam 2014 districts of bihar in west bengal only one study observed mean groundwater nitrate crossing mpl and mean nitrate concentration values below 20 mg l as shown in fig 9 however high maximum values of 510 mg l thapa et al 2018 and 508 mg l mukherjee and singh 2021 were observed in some parts of the eastern part of igp in birbhum district different sources for outlying high groundwater nitrate content were fertilizer use hossain et al 2021 thapa et al 2018 septic tank leakages sewage and animal waste batabyal and gupta 2017 mukherjee and singh 2021 farming activities were the major sources for the high level of nitrate in groundwater samples in the nadia district das et al 2020 the ganges brahmaputra delta region sarkar and islam 2021 in nalanda saha and alam 2014 and bhojpur saha et al 2011 mizan et al 2017 in shallow aquifers the regular recharge with fresh water by the seepage from irrigation canals streams and rivers and high rainfall thapa et al 2018 may dilute the groundwater explaining these low nitrate levels in groundwater samples despite high farming activities along with diluting during recharging there are possibilities of denitrification in the landscapes experiencing waterlogging or inundation waterhouse et al 2021 such as floodplains in eastern parts of igp however there may be multiple reasons for observed low nitrate concentration in shallow groundwater such as the presence of organic matters in sedimentary aquifers favours the microbial reduction of nitrate oxidation of reduced minerals in aquifers like pyrite driven by nitrate and dilution due to recharge castaldo et al 2021 postma et al 1991 juncher jørgensen et al 2009 these reasons may be valid for the very low groundwater nitrate content in extensive agriculture regions of igp where there is a vast network of rivers streams and irrigation canals recharging aquifers macdonald et al 2016 bowen 1985 keesari et al 2017 krishan et al 2021 presence of reducing aquifers and organic matters facilitating nitrate reduction kumar et al 2014 2016 richards et al 2020 sarkar et al 2022 kumar and singh 2020 for example in punjab five studies reported none and four reported less than ten percent of the samples exceeding mpl for nitrate content in groundwater low groundwater nitrate concentrations observed in the doab regions of punjab kumar and singh 2020 purushothaman et al 2014 may be due to the consumption of nitrate by the oxidation of reduced sulphide minerals or denitrification by microbes kumar and singh 2020 or maybe the aquifers of doab regions get continuously recharged by the confluent rivers bowen 1985 bonsor et al 2017 with fresh water may be diluting the groundwater nitrate content it is interesting to notice that regions with higher recharge due to high rainfall and or high density of river and irrigation had low groundwater nitrate despite intensive farming activities in an isotope study in sonipat haryana sheikh et al 2017 reported that recharge from canal seepage and monsoon was responsible for the dilution of groundwater there in other isotopic investigations in igp similar observations were made by tiwari et al 2016 kumar et al 2021 and kulkarni et al 2018 however these were more focused on geogenic arsenic since very few research studies have reported the reason for low values of nitrate content in the igp more isotopic studies are needed to specifically delineate the mechanism responsible it will be interesting to note here that during the denitrification process naturally available geogenic uranium in alluvial aquifer sediments may get mobilize westrop et al 2023 bonotto et al 2019 recently significant number of studies from igp has reported the occurrence of the uranium in groundwater two meta analysis from punjab kumar et al 2023 sahoo et al 2022 and field studies in bihar kumar et al 2018 richards et al 2020 gupta and singh 2023 had observed significant correlation between groundwater nitrate and uranium dissolution in aquifers overall groundwater nitrate pollution was reported throughout the igp however it was mostly observed in the north western parts of the igp and towards the eastern parts nitrate pollution was sparingly observed there were various sources of groundwater nitrate pollution in igp such as agriculture sewage septic tank leakage landfill domestic waste and industrial effluents as delineated in table 2 with high medium and low percentage contributions from this review of the peer reviewed articles it was evident that land use was the major factor determining the sources of nitrate contamination in igp for example in rural areas agricultural activities primarily using high amounts of fertilizers followed by animal waste disposal were dominant sources of nitrate contamination reported by eighty four percent and nineteen percent of the articles respectively as illustrated in fig 10 on the other hand in urban areas sewage or open drains leakage from the septic tank landfill and effluents from industrial areas were the primary sources only one study reported the geogenic source of nitrate contamination despite intensive farming and a vast population the low nitrate content in the aquifer may be due to dilution by recharge denitrification and the presence of reduced minerals therefore nitrate content in groundwater of igp is majorly regulated by the nitrogenous compound loading from various sources and different nitrate reduction mechanisms in india since the 1960s fertilizer application has seen an increasing trend as shown in fig 2 states in the igp are consuming fertilizer above the indian national average 128 kg ha as shown in fig 11 this uptrend in fertilizer application may be deleterious for surface and groundwater bodies and may negatively impact human health for example in china due to the excessive application of nitrogenous fertilizer around 400 kg ha more than double india s fertilizer consumption china is facing a grave issue of a very high level of nitrate in both surface water bodies and groundwater consequently many studies evaluating groundwater nitrate in china reported severe threats to human health liu et al 2021a 2021b zhang et al 2021 zhai et al 2017 su et al 2013 if the same rate or an increase in fertilizer application continues in india there is a higher possibility that nitrate contamination in the groundwater resources of igp may increase and severely impact the health of humans since nitrate has also been correlated with other toxic metals such as uranium arsenic cadmium nickel and manganese it is important to design water quality studies with a boarder perspective to effectively estimate the health risks however the next section is limited to only estimating the non carcinogenic health risks from groundwater nitrate 4 2 non carcinogenic human health risk assessment long term exposure to nitrate contaminated groundwater can adversely impact human health as described previously groundwater is an important source of domestic water use including for meeting drinking water needs in india groundwater in some regions of the igp was reported to be heavily polluted with nitrate as discussed earlier this study appraises the non carcinogenic human health risk hhr due to the nitrate concentration in the groundwater samples of the igp collected in 2016 hhr assessment was carried out for the children female and male as per the standard guidelines of the united state environmental protection agency usepa usepa 1989 according to uspea health risk guidelines a total hazard index hi value of less than one is considered safe and an hi value of more than one is considered a potential health risk the spatial distribution of hhr estimated with the values of hi is depicted in fig 12 for three classes based on age and gender the estimated values for hi vary between 0 and 61 mean 0 83 0 50 mean 0 67 and 0 43 mean 0 56 for age groups of children adult males and females respectively as shown in table 3 out of the total groundwater samples consumption of 34 29 3 and 25 2 samples may cause a probable health risk for children male and female respectively however when the percentage area considered 26 7 19 and 16 25 area of the igp may have potential health risk to children males and females respectively hhr assessment suggests that children appear to be more vulnerable to ingestion of nitrate contaminated water in the study region due to their lower body weight as illustrated in fig 12 the hi maps indicate that regions in the north western parts were critically affected by nitrate contamination and had a very high potential risk of non carcinogenic diseases for all children adult males and females the green regions depict the safe zones for consuming groundwater whereas the yellow and red regions show moderate and very high potential health risks respectively six non carcinogenic hhr assessments concerning nitrate contamination were carried out in the study area in jalandhar district punjab 37 and 15 of samples were found to have potential health risks to children and adults respectively due to nitrate contamination caused by agricultural activities improper sewage systems and leakage from the septic tanks singh et al 2020 in the malwa region of punjab the situation was reported to be much worse as 100 and 96 of the samples were at very health risk to children and adults respectively due to the leakage from the septic tank industrial wastes open landfill and agricultural activities ahada and suthar 2018 around 8 and 7 of groundwater samples in panipat haryana pose health risks to children and adults respectively kaur et al 2020b in kunda pratapgarh uttar pradesh due to the high nitrate contamination 62 59 and 57 of samples were reported to be of high probable health risk for infants children and adults respectively maurya et al 2020 similar health threats due to nitrate contamination were reported in the gaya kumar et al 2019 and birbhum mukherjee and singh 2021 districts of bihar and west bengal respectively the hhr estimates of the current study show similar observations in the north western parts of igp comprising southwestern and central regions of the punjab state singh et al 2020 ahada and suthar 2018 pratapgarh mid igp maurya et al 2020 and small patches in eastern igp encompassing gaya kumar et al 2019 and birbhum mukherjee and singh 2021 similarly low hhr regions are shown in green in northern regions of igp showing similar estimates as reported by kaur et al 2020b in panipat also validates the hhr assessment 4 3 measures to control groundwater contamination and remediation approaches the most effective measure to control nitrates in water bodies is the reduction at source as demonstrated by european union eu through various legislative tools nitrate directive in european union council directive 91 676 eec came to force on 12th december 1991 to reduce the nitrate level in surface and groundwater from agricultural sources by promoting good framing practices eu 1991 nitrate directive includes eu members designating nitrate vulnerable zones nvz monitoring and reporting nitrate content in water every four years and limiting the annual nitrate loading to 170 kg ha eu 1991 following this directive a more comprehensive groundwater directive 2006 118 ec and water framework directive 2000 60 ec were introduced since 1991 there has been a dramatic decline in fertilizer application in the eu as depicted in fig 2 consequently the nitrate content in groundwater resources of the eu did not increase significantly groundwater quality either improved or remained similar at 74 of the monitoring stations xin et al 2021 similar to the eu s good farming practices the us states have developed an online platform for disseminating best management practices however it is not regulated usepa 2022 and china has provided scientific guidance for applying fertilizers and irrigation on major crops mara 2010 this guidance includes optimal fertilizer and manure use tillage techniques and irrigation management in india even though water pollution monitoring system has been developed since the last more than four decades yet the monitoring and regulatory system has failed to achieve the objective and nitrate contamination has increased many folds over the last two decades on 19th february 2015 the ministry of agriculture and farmer s welfare launched the soil health card scheme intended to provide scientific recommendations to farmers based on 12 macro and micro including nitrogen of their village level soil nutrients data for judicious applications of fertilizers and manures however no systematic analysis has been done so far to measure the impact of this policy tool in reducing pollution load nitrate contamination in aquifers can also be reduced through various effective approaches such as application of phytoremediation agroforestry and permeable reactive barrier prb zhao et al 2022 agroforestry can prevent up to 97 7 of nitrogen leaching from soil to groundwater pavlidis and tsihrintzis 2018 for example the poplar tree arrest nitrate leaching to the subsurface by utilizing soil nitrates for growth and removing significant quantity with a nitrate removal rate range of 46 66 138 667 kg nha 1 year 1 ranjan 2021 prb is the emplacement of physical chemical or biological reactive horizontal or vertical layer to provide favourable condition to stimulate reactions against the contaminant plume flow path and transform the groundwater contaminants to environmentally acceptable remediation goals faisal et al 2018 among various prbs biological prb is commonly employed for nitrate remediation and most economical zhao et al 2022 generally carbon sources such as woodchips sawdust mulch etc are used as reactive barrier for stimulating denitrification and its end product is harmless nitrogen gibert et al 2019 for example gibert et al 2019 reported that 97 removal when 280 mg l nitrate were applied and its efficiency reduces to 66 when 530 mg l applied nitrate in groundwater can also be considered as the source of nitrogenous fertilizer datta et al 1997 the pump and fertilize paf method has effectively reduced fertilizer use and groundwater nitrate concentration liang et al 2016 observed that applying the paf method under 490 mm of irrigation for corn crop can provide approximately 42 kg nha 1 year 1 of nitrate from the groundwater and proportionately improve groundwater quality bastani and harter 2019 reported 60 reduction from 60 years application of paf apart from these various studies reported the removal of nutrients with managed aquifer recharge mar through both infiltration bekele et al 2011 schmidt et al 2012 and injection vanderzalm et al 2020 mechanisms gorski et al 2020 observed up to 100 removal of nitrate during infiltratation at low rate 0 5 m day through infiltration pond mar while during aquifer storage and recovery injection type mar up to 67 total nitrogen removal were reported by vanderzalm et al 2020 nitrate removal following mar operations were generally by dilution schmidt et al 2012 nitrate in drinking water can be treated by different approaches first is through separation in which nitrate is separated from the water by various techniques such as reverse osmosis adsorption ion exchange and electrodialysis sharma and bhattacharya 2017 second is transformation of nitrate into innocuous nitrogen gas through microbial denitrification and catalytic reduction methods abascal et al 2021 compared to separation transformation methods are more environment friendly as there is negligible waste and are economical abascal et al 2021 sharma and bhattacharya 2017 for example biological nitrate remediation was observed to be 43 economical than reverse osmosis more environment friendly and energy efficient alguacil duarte et al 2022 similarly biochar from various farm waste can be employed for developing low cost water purifier for rural community fseha et al 2022 liu et al 2022b however reverse osmosis ion exchange and electrodialysis are more matured technologies for sustainable water quality management in the perspective of groundwater nitrate contamination india needs three approaches first large scale regular groundwater quality monitoring second control at sources and third remediation of contaminated water and aquifers since farming is the major source of nitrate contamination the knowledge of nutrients in soil as well as in groundwater will help farmers to make judicious decisions in applying adequate quantity of fertilizers or manures virtuous applications of agroforestry managed aquifer recharge and paf will economically help in controlling as well as in remediating groundwater nitrate contaminations in india groundwater is generally assumed to be clean and safe for drinking suhag 2016 so a large scale awareness campaign is required recent indian government policy har ghar jal yojana under jal jeevan mission on providing tap drinking water to each household is mainly supplied by tapping groundwater however it often lacks water treatment facilities wescoat jr et al 2022 so generating more informed scientific debates and planning appropriate interventions are critical for ensuring groundwaterquality in the igp in particular and india in general 5 future studies and recommendations in the future there may be an increase in groundwater nitrate contamination particularly in eastern regions of igp due to higher intensification of agricultural activities such a scenario may pose a more serious public health threat if no effective measures are implemented to monitor the water pollution sources and regulate the polluting activities in urban peri urban and rural areas it would be impossible to meet the sdg 6 targets if appropriate amendments are not made to check the uncontrolled discharge of nitrate through point and non point sources in the study area since agricultural activities are the primary reason for nitrate pollution in the environment in rural parts of igp it is suggested that mass scale awareness generation programs are required and public involvement is sought at multiple levels by different state and non state actors to regulate and slow down the nitrate use for agricultural purposes similarly large scale groundwater quality monitoring and decimation of information regarding groundwater nitrate remediation and filtration are recommended to avoid health issues the government s effort to decimate the information to farmers about their soil health through soil health card scheme requires systematic analysis to measure the effectiveness in reducing pollution load similarly urban and rural local bodies and environmental agencies will have to implement more strict monitoring and other appropriate policy tools to regulate nitrate pollution in urban areas it is essential to investigate the mechanism regulating the nitrate pollutant in the aquifers of igp as it will reveal the factors responsible for the low nitrate level in the eastern igp therefore the isotopic studies for nitrate pollutant are highly suggested there is an urgent requirement for studies to be designed to investigate groundwater nitrate with other toxic co contaminates particularly uranium this will help in understanding the mobilization mechanism of nitrate uranium and other co contaminates from the aquifers there is need to investigate the proven methods to remediate groundwater nitrate such as mar paf and agroforestry along with the judicious application of fertilizers more research and regular monitoring are required in the eastern parts of igp especially in states like bihar which is becoming the top fertilizer consuming state in the country climate change will alter the hydrological processes with changes to surface water flow evaporation groundwater recharge groundwater level and flow these will impact the concentration of nitrate in groundwater therefore understanding these changes will help the future generation better deal with the complex impact of climate change 6 conclusion this work investigates the groundwater nitrate contamination of the indo gangetic plains igp by analyzing the groundwater geochemical data and hhr after analyzing a total of 94 research works on groundwater data from the igp and hhr the following outcomes were drawn i the presence of nitrate in groundwater exceeding the mpl of 45 mg l was observed throughout the igp ii groundwater in the northern and western parts were significantly contaminated with nitrate compared to eastern parts as only a few samples were reported to surpass the mpl in eastern parts of igp iii throughout the igp agricultural activities have been the dominant cause for the groundwater nitrate pollution particularly from the nitrogenous fertilizer consumption and iv groundwater in approximately 27 19 and 16 25 area of the igp may pose health risks to children adult males and females respectively the hhr caused by the nitrate in groundwater was more prevalent in the north western parts of igp and was consistent with the spatial distribution of groundwater nitrate contaminations reported in the works of literature importantly leakages from the septic tanks sewage drains and landfill sites and disposal of industrial wastes have been the primary reasons in urban regions finally based on this review and hhr assessment it can be said that nitrate in groundwater resources of the igp is ubiquitously observed and is majorly linked with the application of fertilizer and improper waste disposal from urban regions groundwater quality issues mainly remain invisible to the masses therefore great effort and collaboration are needed from the researcher policymakers regulators farming community and common people so that proper interventions can be designed and implemented to address groundwater nitrate pollution and achieve

11628,groundwater supplies are progressively being degraded by anthropogenic pollution making it challenging to meet the sustainable development goals sdgs of access to safe and clean drinking water sdg 6 1 and 6 3 and reduction of illness and death from hazardous pollutants sdg 3 9 nitrate is one such widespread groundwater pollutant mainly emanating from agricultural activities and improper waste disposal posing global health concerns like blue baby syndrome thyroid disorders and cancers due to prolonged exposure to high concentrations indo gangetic plain igp in india is known for its intensive agricultural practices which support a vast population of about 500 million people this study aims to investigate the geospatial distribution of nitrate concentration in igp along with their potential sources and associated non carcinogenic health risks hhr employing prisma preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses framework this paper reviews 94 peer reviewed articles on nitrate pollution in the groundwater reported throughout the igp specifically north western regions of igp were more contaminated than eastern regions from this systemic review it was evident that land use was the determining factor for the sources of nitrate contamination in igp in agricultural areas fertilizers and manures whereas in settlement areas open drains and leakage from the septic tank were the major sources hhr assessment indicates that children of age group 0 6 years were at higher health risks than adults hhr assessment of groundwater samples of the igp reveals that consumption of 34 29 3 and 25 2 of samples may cause a potential health risk for children males and females respectively overall the hazard index estimate illustrates that northern and western parts had a very high potential risk of diseases for all age groups whereas eastern regions mostly appeared safe this review provides a comprehensive outlook on the status of groundwater nitrate pollution in the igp which offers scientific rationale to the governments and policy makers to formulate appropriate interventions to protect the groundwater quality against nitrate pollution graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrate pollution groundwater quality indo gangetic plain health risk fertilizer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrate is a ubiquitous pollutant in the subsurface environment bhatnagar and sillanpää 2011 abascal et al 2021 gutiérrez et al 2018 nitrate is a water soluble and stable form of nitrogen accumulated in subsurface systems li et al 2019 burkart and stoner 2008 the nitrate concentration in aquifers is generally low in undisturbed aquifers however an elevated concentration indicates anthropogenic sources rahman et al 2021 nitrogenous compounds are naturally available in the environment from various sources like symbiotic relationships of plants and microbes atmospheric depositions or igneous rocks gutiérrez et al 2018 however due to anthropogenic activities such as increasing use of nitrogen fertilizer improper disposal of animal waste and wastewater leakage from sewage and septic systems the nitrate contamination in groundwater has increased significantly in recent years more importantly nitrate pollution is becoming global health ward et al 2018 and ecological concern romanelli et al 2020 prolonged exposure to high nitrate concentrations is also linked to severe health issues like blue baby syndrome thyroid disorders and cancers ward et al 2018 who 2017 nitrate containing groundwater discharge to water bodies can lead to eutrophication which steers to excessive algal bloom plant growth and ultimately degrades the aquatic ecosystems water resources and negatively impacts related socio economic spheres romanelli et al 2020 vilmin et al 2018 yao et al 2016 a few studies have correlated the groundwater nitrate with the mobilization of uranium from the aquifer materials riedel and kübeck 2018 riedel et al 2022 nolan and weber 2015 and recent studies have reported direct evidence for nitrate stimulated groundwater uranium mobilization bonotto et al 2019 westrop et al 2023 uranium is a nephrotoxin compound and can damage dna brugge et al 2005 goodman 1985 thus monitoring pollution levels and subsequent actions including nitrogen source control are essential to prevent nitrate pollution as once aquifers get contaminated with nitrate it would be difficult to mitigate as remediation is expensive burkart and stoner 2008 re et al 2017 if no proper measure is taken to control nitrate contamination the groundwater quality will severely degrade as predicted under the climate change scenarios stuart et al 2011 the nitrate level in groundwater is expected to be doubled by 2100 stuart et al 2011 therefore given the increasing trend in nitrate levels in the subsurface system and its impact on human health it is crucial to understand the spatial extent of nitrate contamination and its sources an increased proportion of nitrate content in groundwater is a growing concern and common phenomenon across the world for example in lithuania the nitrate contamination in groundwater has significantly risen to 2753 mg l slavinskienė and jurevičius 2016 in india high levels of nitrate were observed in groundwater samples in various areas such as 2000 mg l in muktsar haryana pant et al 2020 a maximum of 1923 mg l in najafgarh delhi adhikary et al 2012 896 mg l in nalgonda andhra pradesh brindha and elango 2014 and 700 mg l in southern haryana kumari and rai 2020 in china a notable increase in nitrate level of 984 mg l was reported in weifang liu et al 2021a 895 mg l with a mean of 170 mg l in jiaokou zhang et al 2021 and 642 mg l with an average of 76 mg l in shandong province liu et al 2021b abascal et al 2021 have well documented the global regions exceeding the world health organization s who recommended maximum permissible limits mpl for nitrate in groundwater 50 mg l who 2017 gutiérrez et al 2018 and abascal et al 2021 delineated the origins of nitrate pollution in groundwater mainly from human activities especially agriculture sewage leakages from septic tanks landfill sites and industrial wastes since nitrate contamination is usually observed in agrarian regions and densely populated areas the indo gangetic plain igp known for intensive agricultural practice and very high population may have widespread groundwater nitrate pollution igp is considered one of the biggest alluvial aquifer systems in the world macdonald et al 2016 spread over an area of around 52 million ha supporting a population of around 500 million people according to census 2011 for states of delhi haryana punjab bihar uttar pradesh and west bengal with a population density of about 900 per sq km census 2011 igp aquifer is set up by the eroded sediments from the himalayan rivers particularly indus and ganges rivers forming a flat fertile plain that supports innumerable agrarian practices and a vast population since 3000 bc gopal 1990 since the green revolution in the late 1960s the fertilizer input to the crops has significantly increased in igp more dramatically in the western parts of igp also known as the bread basket of india singh and craswell 2021 in 2010 in the igp 15 to 20 million dug well tube wells abstracted around 205 km3 of groundwater and this rate has increased by 2 5 km3 year as farmers have continuously intensified their farming practices macdonald et al 2016 farming intensification has led to increased extraction of groundwater and rampant fertilizer application has impacted the groundwater quality severely hence north western part of the igp has become one of the macro hotspots for groundwater nitrate contamination due to the rampant application of nitrogenous fertilizers singh and craswell 2021 moreover this intensive agricultural practice is spreading throughout the igp particularly in the eastern parts where a mega national program called bringing green revolution to eastern india bgrei pathak et al 2019 is promoting modern methods of rice production government interventions leading to agricultural intensification in the region may create newer groundwater nitrate pollution hotspots in the future since 85 of the population directly relies on groundwater for drinking in india world bank 2012 nitrate consumption through drinking water may lead to serious health issues in igp ahada and suthar 2018 mukherjee and singh 2021 it is crucial to study how groundwater nitrate contamination was reported over the period in the igp region and what were the primary sources in addition this study will analyze how nitrate pollution may threaten the health of the groundwater consuming population this study will help to understand the challenges india will face to achieve the sustainable development goals sdgs 6 1 and 6 3 sharma 2021 united nations 2015 abascal et al 2021 is the only review that studied global groundwater nitrate contamination describing the contamination levels sources and removal technologies sarkar et al 2021 studied the spatial variation of groundwater nitrate content in india from the data retrieved from the national rural drinking water programme database however it did not cover many nitrate polluted regions reported by various individual studies mainly from igp which has been considered a major limitation besides large scale or global scale studies are lacking in interpreting the comprehensive details needed for understanding the level of contamination spatial distribution sources and health impacts due to groundwater nitrate contaminations for effective governance and management at the regional scale for effective and sustainable remediation of groundwater contamination and achieving sdg 6 3 a region specific investigation is needed in igp numerous articles published till december 2022 articulate groundwater quality parameters including nitrate content however a detailed nitrate pollution picture with its subsequent health impact at a regional level is lacking a comprehensive review and assessment of the health impact of groundwater nitrate pollution which had not been done at the regional scale would be a novel attempt therefore this research intends to examine the nitrate levels in groundwater and their potential sources in igp in addition the geospatial distribution of nitrate concentration and non carcinogenic health risks hhr will be analyzed for the igp this review discusses the sources of nitrate in groundwater and its health impact and offers discussions with an emphasis on human health risk assessment thus this review aims to a delineate the nitrate pollution in groundwater and its sources from the published peer reviewed articles till 2022 and b estimate the overall health impacts with a regional focus on igp lastly this study will provide a comprehensive picture of the state of nitrate pollution and associated health risks in the igp this work can be helpful to the decision maker in taking appropriate actions to protect the groundwater quality and decimating information concerning the ill effect of groundwater nitrate pollution 2 sources and health impact of nitrate 2 1 sources of nitrate in groundwater the nitrogen cycle is a complicated biogeochemical cycle in which nitrogenous compounds are transformed into various forms in gaseous liquid and solid phases mosier et al 2004 fig 1 illustrates a simplified nitrogen cycle highlighting the significant pathways covering atmospheric deposition nitrogen fixation organic plant and animal and anthropogenic fertilization as various nitrogen inputs to the soil ammonification nitrification and denitrification as the phases of the transformation the natural nitrogen cycle is continuously perturbed by anthropogenic activities such as food cultivation and using fossil fuels for energy vitousek et al 1997 in fig 1 the natural processes such as animal plant and microbial activities are shown in blue while anthropogenic activities such as agriculture sewage landfill septic tank leakages and fossil fuel emission are shown in red nitrogen is an essential crop nutrient typically applied to the soil by applying either an organic for example manure or a synthetic for example urea and ammonia fertilizer burkart and stoner 2008 despite whether the nitrogen sources are organic or synthetic the application of fertilizer usually surpasses the quantity absorbed by the plants on a global scale it was estimated that crops take up only 55 of nitrogen fertilizer about 16 leaches to the subsurface and the remaining 29 losses through environmental emissions liu et al 2010 in soil various compounds of nitrogen are transformed into nitrate through nitrifications nitrate is primarily stable and mobile with a lower affinity for attaching to soil particles it quickly leaches down to groundwater systems mosier et al 2004 despite such high solubility and stability in water nitrate in groundwater is not homogenously found in the subsurface systems ryker and jones 1995 studies have shown a significant difference in nitrate concentration within an aquifer however groundwater of shallow depth tends to have higher concentrations than the deeper depth of an aquifer zhang et al 2014 karanveer and das 2022 since the large scale synthetic fertilizer production in the 1960s the world s food production has dramatically changed shi 2016 in 1910 haber bosch developed the process of ammonia synthesis in which atmospheric nitrogen n2 was synthesized into ammonia nh3 a procedure for fertilizer production that tripled the global food harvest between 1961 and 2006 mosier et al 2004 since then the global demand for synthetic fertilizers has been increasing at an estimated 1 8 per annum fao 2015 among the major fertilizer user in kg ha since 1990 china has been the highest fertilizer consuming nation with around 390 460 kg ha average consumption during 2010 2018 india is the second highest fertilizer consumer with around 175 kg ha the european union and the united states of america were consuming similar to the global average of 136 kg ha as shown in fig 2 higher fertilizer consumption gets reflected in the elevated nitrate content in the groundwater this can be understood by the trends in north china having the highest fertilizer consumption in the country fig 3 zhang et al 1996 found high levels of nitrates in more than 40 of the groundwater samples in north china with a maximum of 300 mg l in the 1990s recent studies show that the nitrate health risk is high in north china for example in shandong province with a maximum nitrate concentration of around 642 mg l and a mean of 76 mg l liu et al 2021b nitrogen rich fertilizer also has a legacy issue which means it can stay in the soil for an extended period and leaches into the groundwater later threatening the future groundwater quality and even being considered a time bomb of environmental challenges wang et al 2013 a recent study in north china shows that about 118 5 6302 8 mg l in the deep vadose zone which would leach into the groundwater may pose a very high nitrate threat liu et al 2022a from the example of north china it can be concluded that the very high application of nitrogen rich fertilizer not only creates nitrate pollution in the present time but also threatens future groundwater quality nitrate in groundwater is often a commonly considered agricultural pollutant and generally it is assumed that higher nitrate pollution prevailed in agricultural dominated regions than in the subsurface of urban areas however several studies reported that nitrate concentration in groundwater was similar in regions of human settlements and industries in comparison with agricultural regions even some of the highest concentrations were observed in cities from non agricultural sources wakida and lerner 2005 abascal et al 2021 non agricultural nitrate pollution sources comprise leakages from septic tanks sewage systems landfills and the discharge of improperly treated industrial and domestic wastewater in nottingham city wakida and lerner 2005 observed that leakage from the sewage systems is responsible for 38 of the nitrogen loading in the city s aquifer point sources of pollutants are found in urban and industrial regions and these sources discharge very concentrated pollutants into the environment for example the highest worldwide nitrate concentration of 2753 mg l was observed in the groundwater of lithuania close to a landfill site abascal et al 2021 slavinskienė and jurevičius 2016 improper discharge at an industrial site in qinling mountains west central china accounts for a high concentration of 850 mg l i e more than 40 times the background nitrate level in the region jia et al 2020 an example of a non agricultural point source of nitrate pollution in groundwater in rural or peri urban areas the sources of groundwater nitrate are often observed to be a combination of agricultural sources and domestic wastes brindha and elango 2014 kou et al 2021 rahman et al 2021 2 2 health impact in a recent comprehensive review ward et al 2018 found strong evidence between exposure to nitrate contaminated water and severe health effects apart from methemoglobinemia for colorectal cancer thyroid issues and congenital disabilities the maximum permissible level set by the who guideline and the european drinking water directive 98 83 e c for nitrate level in potable water is 50 mg l 11 mg l as nitrate nitrogen n o 3 n is 0 2258 times the n o 3 whereas in india and the united states this value is 45 mg l or 10 mg l as n usepa 1997 bis 2012 this maximum permission level was set to protect infants from methemoglobinemia blue baby syndrome however further health risks such as various cancers thyroid disorders and neural tube defects were not considered usepa 2022 international agency for research on cancer iarc assessment reported that consumed nitrate that leads to endogenous nitrosation is likely carcinogenic to humans iarc 2010 endogenous nitrosation is a chemical reaction that occurs when nitrosation agents developed from nitrate with nitrosated compounds for example amines produce n nitroso compounds noc these noc cause dna degrading metabolites that can develop cancerous lesions georgeson et al 2022 gurjao et al 2021 recent meta analyses on nitrate contamination and cancers have reported a significant correlation between nitrate with colorectal risk hosseini et al 2021 essien et al 2022 and gastric cancer risk picetti et al 2022 in california valley usa tariqi and naughton 2021 observed a significant correlation between thyroid cancer and higher nitrate level particularly among the disadvantageous communities consuming nitrate contaminated drinking water during pregnancy is also associated with a higher risk of congenital disabilities such as neural tube congenital disabilities and preterm birth as well as meagre birth weight stayner et al 2017 in addition to cancer and birth defect risks thyroid disease was also found to be evident in the rising prevalence of hypothyroidism with elevated nitrate concentration in drinking water in children women or pregnant women an animal study observed that intake of higher nitrate concentrations could competitively inhibit the absorption of iodine and cause thyroid gland enlargement de groef et al 2006 in slovakia the increased occurrence of subclinical hypothyroidism was found amongst school children who consume higher concentrations of nitrate 51 274 mg l as compared to children consuming lesser concentrations of nitrate 50 mg l tajtáková et al 2006 similarly in a study of two different bulgarian villages clinical examination of thyroid glands of pregnant women and children observed around four and three times enlargement of thyroid glands respectively in a village with high nitrate level 75 mg l as compared to a village with lower nitrate level 8 mg l gatseva and argirova 2008 these studies were mainly carried out in developed countries where nitrate concentration in drinking water generally is relatively low than the permissible limits elwood and van der werf 2022 however in developing countries and emerging economies like china india and many underdeveloped african countries the concentration of nitrate is reported to be much more than the permissible limit which can be a matter of concern for the health risks in these regions abascal et al 2021 an economic impact assessment in the usa reported that the economic cost of nitrate consumption was estimated to be between 250 millions and 1 5 billions u s dollars usd and productivity lost will cost around 1 3 6 5 billions usd temkin et al 2019 parts of around 423 districts in india reported having excess nitrate above 45 mg l cgwb 2019b the health impact of nitrate pollution is enormous and mitigating nitrate pollution is going to be extremely expensive and challenging yet urgent affair for regional and national governments nitrate is a well known groundwater pollutant also known for influencing the fate and transport of heavy metals such as uranium u cadmium cd and manganese mn in groundwater riedel et al 2022 ingestion of these heavy metals is injurious to human health particularly u and cd u is a nephrotoxin that may limit bone growth and damage dna if consumed in higher quantities than the who s mpl of 30 μg l brugge et al 2005 goodman 1985 cd exposure is associated with various cancers such as lung and breast cancers glucose metabolism disorder cardiac failure kidney issues and cerebral infarction pan et al 2010 nordberg et al 2018 mn is an essential nutrient but excess can lead to neurodegenerative disorder avila et al 2013 and affect children s cognitive ability kullar et al 2019 the following sections will discuss the methodologies employed and the results of the literature review and hhr of groundwater samples of the igp 3 methodology for review on nitrate contamination and related health risk assessment 3 1 study area indo gangetic plain the indo gangetic plain igp alluvial aquifer system is amongst the largest available freshwater resources on the earth macdonald et al 2016 igp developed by the sediment deposition by the himalayan rivers indus ganges and brahmaputra rivers and their tributaries forming fertile plains across eastern pakistan northern and eastern india southern nepal and almost the whole of bangladesh fig 4 a for this study the northern and eastern indian part of igp was considered specifically the states of haryana punjab delhi union territory and india s capital uttar pradesh bihar and west bengal this study region is 520 014 km2 with a population of more than 466 million census 2011 the igp gets most of the rainfall from june to september and the rainfall pattern varies throughout igp punjab haryana delhi uttar pradesh bihar and west bengal gets an average rainfall of 780 mm 615 mm 612 mm 1279 mm 1030 mm and 2074 mm respectively ganges and indus rivers with tributaries support the largest irrigation canal systems on igp developed during the colonial and post independence period in south asia shah 2009 the aquifers in igp recharge from rainfall and other sources particularly rivers and irrigation canal systems bonsor et al 2017 in 2017 about 165 billion cubic meters of water were recharged in the study region s aquifers which was about 38 of the total groundwater recharge in india despite having 16 of the total area of india cgwb 2020 despite the vast irrigation canal system groundwater abstraction is increasing in the region which comprises more than 25 of the worldwide groundwater withdrawal macdonald et al 2016 in igp the quantity and quality are threatened by the extensive abstraction of groundwater particularly in the northern and western parts of igp macdonald et al 2016 3 2 preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma moher et al 2009 was used to find literature to be included in the systematic literature review prisma is the most used method for systematic reviews and meta analysis prisma has four stages of literature selection first the articles are identified from the scopus database second is the screening of irrelevant articles by reading the abstract for relevance with groundwater nitrate pollution and indian parts of igp study area third is the eligibility stage where the full text is viewed for exclusion based on data availability and the final stage represents the total articles that would be studied for the systemic review for review on nitrate contaminations in groundwater resources of igp all the articles on geochemical or hydrogeochemical or groundwater quality studies carried out in the indian part of igp i e haryana punjab delhi bihar uttar pradesh and west bengal were studied as shown in fig 5 articles were searched

lead to several human health risks there are two consumption mediums the first is through drinking water or oral route and the second is from skin surface exposure or dermal route mukherjee and singh 2021 rahman et al 2021 these two exposure pathways are used for the non carcinogenic human health risk assessment hhr model developed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 1989 table 1 shows various models utilized for hhr analysis since nitrate is not considered carcinogenic in this study hhr is carried out for three population groups female male and children the hhr due to nitrate was estimated by the total sum value of the hazard quotient hq for oral and dermal pathways mukherjee and singh 2021 usepa 1989 adimalla and qian 2021 by employing the following equations 1 c

estimating the hhr nitrate values in groundwater resources of the igp were taken from the central ground water board s data for the year 2016 cgwb 2019a 5 h i i 1 n h q o r a l h q d e r m a l 3 4 the data employed for the health risk assessment the nitrate data used was from the central ground water board s cgwb groundwater quality database ground water quality in shallow aquifer in india 2018 the sampling and analysis were carried by the cgwb s state divisions from groundwater observation wells for the health risk assessment we employ 2735 sampling data belonging to the igp study area were carried out in the pre monsoon months of april may 2016 cgwb 2019a from the database of 2010 2018 the dataset of 2016 was selected due to the availibility of largest number of nitrate data as illustrated in fig 4 b before sampling the stagnant water of the borewell were removed and then sample were collected in 1 liter high density polyethylene bottles the nitrate ion was determined through the uv spectrophotometric method 4 results and discussion 4 1 nitrate concentration distribution and sources in igp groundwater bodies a total of 322 articles were identified in the first stage of the prisma shown in fig 5 after identification 322 abstracts were read to screen the articles not relevant to nitrate contamination in groundwater to exclude such articles at the screening stage 184 articles were excluded and 138 articles were read for eligibility for review after reading the full articles 94 articles were included in the review based on the availability of groundwater nitrate concentration values a maximum of 31 studies were from uttar pradesh 21 from punjab 15 from west bengal and nine each from delhi bihar and haryana as shown in fig 6 illustrating state wise studies most of the studies carried out were recent from 2016 to 2022 nitrate contamination in groundwater was reported throughout the igp as shown in figs 7 9 from the review of the 94 studies it was found that 1521 samples out of 5013 samples that is around 30 34 of the wells were contaminated with nitrate twenty five studies reported mean nitrate concentration more than the mpl most of them were from the north western part of the igp specifically from the states of punjab kumar et al 2020 kaur et al 2020a pant et al 2020 sharma et al 2018 and haryana kumari and rai 2020 rawat et al 2019 chitrakshi and haritash 2018 as shown in fig 7 remarkably very high nitrate concentration of 2000 mg l was observed at the shallow aquifers of muktsar punjab pant et al 2020 812 mg l in the sonipat district rawat et al 2019 and 700 mg l in southern haryana kumari and rai 2020 in these states fertilizer use is the major reason for nitrate in groundwater the states of punjab and haryana are known as the major sites of the indian green revolution which has directed an upsurge in the use of fertilizers and consequently these regions emerged as a hotspot for nitrate pollution singh and sekhon 1976 1979 singh and craswell 2021 since the beginning of the indian green revolution in the late 1960s these states have been among the top fertilizer consuming states as shown in fig 11 which corresponds to increased groundwater nitrate content for example in bathinda district the most studied district for nitrate pollution the mean groundwater nitrate concentration is continuously reported to be increasing as 30 mg l 32 mg l 67 mg l 76 mg l and 92 mg l in the years 2007 2010 2014 2015 and 2017 respectively singh et al 2011 2013 kaur et al 2020a sharma et al 2018 kumar et al 2020 the other studies described high mean groundwater nitrate from urban and industrial areas of delhi adhikary et al 2009 2012 and uttar pradesh mishra et al 2018 2019 raju et al 2009 raju and singh 2017 madhav et al 2021 singh et al 2006 see fig 8 among these najafgarh district was reported to be the most polluted with nitrate with a mean value of 582 mg l and the highest level of 1923 mg l in 2010 adhikary et al 2012 this observation was concurrent with a 2005 study where the mean was 517 mg l with a maximum concentration of 1808 mg l adhikary et al 2009 most of the studies from delhi reported the sources of groundwater nitrate from non point sources like sewages drains leakage from the septic tank animal waste agricultural activities and landfill leachate as the point sources singh et al 2017 dash et al 2010 adhikary et al 2009 2012 kumar et al 2006 srivastava and ramanathan 2008 najafgarh drain was reported to be the most polluting source as it carries sewage and other wastes adhikary et al 2009 2012 singh et al 2017 kumar et al 2006 reported that the fertilizer was not the primary source of nitrate contamination but rather landfill leachate apart from agricultural urban and industrial sources of nitrate contamination in groundwater geological sources were reported for high groundwater nitrate content in mahoba district which lies in bundelkhand granite genesis terrain where the weathering of bedrock led to the leaching of geological nitrogen and elevation of nitrate content in the groundwater ram et al 2021 about twenty six papers from igp reported none while thirteen articles have reported less than ten percent of the samples exceeding mpl for nitrate content in groundwater most of the studies were from eastern regions of the igp mainly from west bengal seven studies and bihar four studies as shown in fig 9 throughout the eastern region the mean values of the studied samples were lower than mpl nitrate concentrations with few exceptions in bhojpur mizan et al 2017 saha et al 2011 and nalanda saha and alam 2014 districts of bihar in west bengal only one study observed mean groundwater nitrate crossing mpl and mean nitrate concentration values below 20 mg l as shown in fig 9 however high maximum values of 510 mg l thapa et al 2018 and 508 mg l mukherjee and singh 2021 were observed in some parts of the eastern part of igp in birbhum district different sources for outlying high groundwater nitrate content were fertilizer use hossain et al 2021 thapa et al 2018 septic tank leakages sewage and animal waste batabyal and gupta 2017 mukherjee and singh 2021 farming activities were the major sources for the high level of nitrate in groundwater samples in the nadia district das et al 2020 the ganges brahmaputra delta region sarkar and islam 2021 in nalanda saha and alam 2014 and bhojpur saha et al 2011 mizan et al 2017 in shallow aquifers the regular recharge with fresh water by the seepage from irrigation canals streams and rivers and high rainfall thapa et al 2018 may dilute the groundwater explaining these low nitrate levels in groundwater samples despite high farming activities along with diluting during recharging there are possibilities of denitrification in the landscapes experiencing waterlogging or inundation waterhouse et al 2021 such as floodplains in eastern parts of igp however there may be multiple reasons for observed low nitrate concentration in shallow groundwater such as the presence of organic matters in sedimentary aquifers favours the microbial reduction of nitrate oxidation of reduced minerals in aquifers like pyrite driven by nitrate and dilution due to recharge castaldo et al 2021 postma et al 1991 juncher jørgensen et al 2009 these reasons may be valid for the very low groundwater nitrate content in extensive agriculture regions of igp where there is a vast network of rivers streams and irrigation canals recharging aquifers macdonald et al 2016 bowen 1985 keesari et al 2017 krishan et al 2021 presence of reducing aquifers and organic matters facilitating nitrate reduction kumar et al 2014 2016 richards et al 2020 sarkar et al 2022 kumar and singh 2020 for example in punjab five studies reported none and four reported less than ten percent of the samples exceeding mpl for nitrate content in groundwater low groundwater nitrate concentrations observed in the doab regions of punjab kumar and singh 2020 purushothaman et al 2014 may be due to the consumption of nitrate by the oxidation of reduced sulphide minerals or denitrification by microbes kumar and singh 2020 or maybe the aquifers of doab regions get continuously recharged by the confluent rivers bowen 1985 bonsor et al 2017 with fresh water may be diluting the groundwater nitrate content it is interesting to notice that regions with higher recharge due to high rainfall and or high density of river and irrigation had low groundwater nitrate despite intensive farming activities in an isotope study in sonipat haryana sheikh et al 2017 reported that recharge from canal seepage and monsoon was responsible for the dilution of groundwater there in other isotopic investigations in igp similar observations were made by tiwari et al 2016 kumar et al 2021 and kulkarni et al 2018 however these were more focused on geogenic arsenic since very few research studies have reported the reason for low values of nitrate content in the igp more isotopic studies are needed to specifically delineate the mechanism responsible it will be interesting to note here that during the denitrification process naturally available geogenic uranium in alluvial aquifer sediments may get mobilize westrop et al 2023 bonotto et al 2019 recently significant number of studies from igp has reported the occurrence of the uranium in groundwater two meta analysis from punjab kumar et al 2023 sahoo et al 2022 and field studies in bihar kumar et al 2018 richards et al 2020 gupta and singh 2023 had observed significant correlation between groundwater nitrate and uranium dissolution in aquifers overall groundwater nitrate pollution was reported throughout the igp however it was mostly observed in the north western parts of the igp and towards the eastern parts nitrate pollution was sparingly observed there were various sources of groundwater nitrate pollution in igp such as agriculture sewage septic tank leakage landfill domestic waste and industrial effluents as delineated in table 2 with high medium and low percentage contributions from this review of the peer reviewed articles it was evident that land use was the major factor determining the sources of nitrate contamination in igp for example in rural areas agricultural activities primarily using high amounts of fertilizers followed by animal waste disposal were dominant sources of nitrate contamination reported by eighty four percent and nineteen percent of the articles respectively as illustrated in fig 10 on the other hand in urban areas sewage or open drains leakage from the septic tank landfill and effluents from industrial areas were the primary sources only one study reported the geogenic source of nitrate contamination despite intensive farming and a vast population the low nitrate content in the aquifer may be due to dilution by recharge denitrification and the presence of reduced minerals therefore nitrate content in groundwater of igp is majorly regulated by the nitrogenous compound loading from various sources and different nitrate reduction mechanisms in india since the 1960s fertilizer application has seen an increasing trend as shown in fig 2 states in the igp are consuming fertilizer above the indian national average 128 kg ha as shown in fig 11 this uptrend in fertilizer application may be deleterious for surface and groundwater bodies and may negatively impact human health for example in china due to the excessive application of nitrogenous fertilizer around 400 kg ha more than double india s fertilizer consumption china is facing a grave issue of a very high level of nitrate in both surface water bodies and groundwater consequently many studies evaluating groundwater nitrate in china reported severe threats to human health liu et al 2021a 2021b zhang et al 2021 zhai et al 2017 su et al 2013 if the same rate or an increase in fertilizer application continues in india there is a higher possibility that nitrate contamination in the groundwater resources of igp may increase and severely impact the health of humans since nitrate has also been correlated with other toxic metals such as uranium arsenic cadmium nickel and manganese it is important to design water quality studies with a boarder perspective to effectively estimate the health risks however the next section is limited to only estimating the non carcinogenic health risks from groundwater nitrate 4 2 non carcinogenic human health risk assessment long term exposure to nitrate contaminated groundwater can adversely impact human health as described previously groundwater is an important source of domestic water use including for meeting drinking water needs in india groundwater in some regions of the igp was reported to be heavily polluted with nitrate as discussed earlier this study appraises the non carcinogenic human health risk hhr due to the nitrate concentration in the groundwater samples of the igp collected in 2016 hhr assessment was carried out for the children female and male as per the standard guidelines of the united state environmental protection agency usepa usepa 1989 according to uspea health risk guidelines a total hazard index hi value of less than one is considered safe and an hi value of more than one is considered a potential health risk the spatial distribution of hhr estimated with the values of hi is depicted in fig 12 for three classes based on age and gender the estimated values for hi vary between 0 and 61 mean 0 83 0 50 mean 0 67 and 0 43 mean 0 56 for age groups of children adult males and females respectively as shown in table 3 out of the total groundwater samples consumption of 34 29 3 and 25 2 samples may cause a probable health risk for children male and female respectively however when the percentage area considered 26 7 19 and 16 25 area of the igp may have potential health risk to children males and females respectively hhr assessment suggests that children appear to be more vulnerable to ingestion of nitrate contaminated water in the study region due to their lower body weight as illustrated in fig 12 the hi maps indicate that regions in the north western parts were critically affected by nitrate contamination and had a very high potential risk of non carcinogenic diseases for all children adult males and females the green regions depict the safe zones for consuming groundwater whereas the yellow and red regions show moderate and very high potential health risks respectively six non carcinogenic hhr assessments concerning nitrate contamination were carried out in the study area in jalandhar district punjab 37 and 15 of samples were found to have potential health risks to children and adults respectively due to nitrate contamination caused by agricultural activities improper sewage systems and leakage from the septic tanks singh et al 2020 in the malwa region of punjab the situation was reported to be much worse as 100 and 96 of the samples were at very health risk to children and adults respectively due to the leakage from the septic tank industrial wastes open landfill and agricultural activities ahada and suthar 2018 around 8 and 7 of groundwater samples in panipat haryana pose health risks to children and adults respectively kaur et al 2020b in kunda pratapgarh uttar pradesh due to the high nitrate contamination 62 59 and 57 of samples were reported to be of high probable health risk for infants children and adults respectively maurya et al 2020 similar health threats due to nitrate contamination were reported in the gaya kumar et al 2019 and birbhum mukherjee and singh 2021 districts of bihar and west bengal respectively the hhr estimates of the current study show similar observations in the north western parts of igp comprising southwestern and central regions of the punjab state singh et al 2020 ahada and suthar 2018 pratapgarh mid igp maurya et al 2020 and small patches in eastern igp encompassing gaya kumar et al 2019 and birbhum mukherjee and singh 2021 similarly low hhr regions are shown in green in northern regions of igp showing similar estimates as reported by kaur et al 2020b in panipat also validates the hhr assessment 4 3 measures to control groundwater contamination and remediation approaches the most effective measure to control nitrates in water bodies is the reduction at source as demonstrated by european union eu through various legislative tools nitrate directive in european union council directive 91 676 eec came to force on 12th december 1991 to reduce the nitrate level in surface and groundwater from agricultural sources by promoting good framing practices eu 1991 nitrate directive includes eu members designating nitrate vulnerable zones nvz monitoring and reporting nitrate content in water every four years and limiting the annual nitrate loading to 170 kg ha eu 1991 following this directive a more comprehensive groundwater directive 2006 118 ec and water framework directive 2000 60 ec were introduced since 1991 there has been a dramatic decline in fertilizer application in the eu as depicted in fig 2 consequently the nitrate content in groundwater resources of the eu did not increase significantly groundwater quality either improved or remained similar at 74 of the monitoring stations xin et al 2021 similar to the eu s good farming practices the us states have developed an online platform for disseminating best management practices however it is not regulated usepa 2022 and china has provided scientific guidance for applying fertilizers and irrigation on major crops mara 2010 this guidance includes optimal fertilizer and manure use tillage techniques and irrigation management in india even though water pollution monitoring system has been developed since the last more than four decades yet the monitoring and regulatory system has failed to achieve the objective and nitrate contamination has increased many folds over the last two decades on 19th february 2015 the ministry of agriculture and farmer s welfare launched the soil health card scheme intended to provide scientific recommendations to farmers based on 12 macro and micro including nitrogen of their village level soil nutrients data for judicious applications of fertilizers and manures however no systematic analysis has been done so far to measure the impact of this policy tool in reducing pollution load nitrate contamination in aquifers can also be reduced through various effective approaches such as application of phytoremediation agroforestry and permeable reactive barrier prb zhao et al 2022 agroforestry can prevent up to 97 7 of nitrogen leaching from soil to groundwater pavlidis and tsihrintzis 2018 for example the poplar tree arrest nitrate leaching to the subsurface by utilizing soil nitrates for growth and removing significant quantity with a nitrate removal rate range of 46 66 138 667 kg nha 1 year 1 ranjan 2021 prb is the emplacement of physical chemical or biological reactive horizontal or vertical layer to provide favourable condition to stimulate reactions against the contaminant plume flow path and transform the groundwater contaminants to environmentally acceptable remediation goals faisal et al 2018 among various prbs biological prb is commonly employed for nitrate remediation and most economical zhao et al 2022 generally carbon sources such as woodchips sawdust mulch etc are used as reactive barrier for stimulating denitrification and its end product is harmless nitrogen gibert et al 2019 for example gibert et al 2019 reported that 97 removal when 280 mg l nitrate were applied and its efficiency reduces to 66 when 530 mg l applied nitrate in groundwater can also be considered as the source of nitrogenous fertilizer datta et al 1997 the pump and fertilize paf method has effectively reduced fertilizer use and groundwater nitrate concentration liang et al 2016 observed that applying the paf method under 490 mm of irrigation for corn crop can provide approximately 42 kg nha 1 year 1 of nitrate from the groundwater and proportionately improve groundwater quality bastani and harter 2019 reported 60 reduction from 60 years application of paf apart from these various studies reported the removal of nutrients with managed aquifer recharge mar through both infiltration bekele et al 2011 schmidt et al 2012 and injection vanderzalm et al 2020 mechanisms gorski et al 2020 observed up to 100 removal of nitrate during infiltratation at low rate 0 5 m day through infiltration pond mar while during aquifer storage and recovery injection type mar up to 67 total nitrogen removal were reported by vanderzalm et al 2020 nitrate removal following mar operations were generally by dilution schmidt et al 2012 nitrate in drinking water can be treated by different approaches first is through separation in which nitrate is separated from the water by various techniques such as reverse osmosis adsorption ion exchange and electrodialysis sharma and bhattacharya 2017 second is transformation of nitrate into innocuous nitrogen gas through microbial denitrification and catalytic reduction methods abascal et al 2021 compared to separation transformation methods are more environment friendly as there is negligible waste and are economical abascal et al 2021 sharma and bhattacharya 2017 for example biological nitrate remediation was observed to be 43 economical than reverse osmosis more environment friendly and energy efficient alguacil duarte et al 2022 similarly biochar from various farm waste can be employed for developing low cost water purifier for rural community fseha et al 2022 liu et al 2022b however reverse osmosis ion exchange and electrodialysis are more matured technologies for sustainable water quality management in the perspective of groundwater nitrate contamination india needs three approaches first large scale regular groundwater quality monitoring second control at sources and third remediation of contaminated water and aquifers since farming is the major source of nitrate contamination the knowledge of nutrients in soil as well as in groundwater will help farmers to make judicious decisions in applying adequate quantity of fertilizers or manures virtuous applications of agroforestry managed aquifer recharge and paf will economically help in controlling as well as in remediating groundwater nitrate contaminations in india groundwater is generally assumed to be clean and safe for drinking suhag 2016 so a large scale awareness campaign is required recent indian government policy har ghar jal yojana under jal jeevan mission on providing tap drinking water to each household is mainly supplied by tapping groundwater however it often lacks water treatment facilities wescoat jr et al 2022 so generating more informed scientific debates and planning appropriate interventions are critical for ensuring groundwaterquality in the igp in particular and india in general 5 future studies and recommendations in the future there may be an increase in groundwater nitrate contamination particularly in eastern regions of igp due to higher intensification of agricultural activities such a scenario may pose a more serious public health threat if no effective measures are implemented to monitor the water pollution sources and regulate the polluting activities in urban peri urban and rural areas it would be impossible to meet the sdg 6 targets if appropriate amendments are not made to check the uncontrolled discharge of nitrate through point and non point sources in the study area since agricultural activities are the primary reason for nitrate pollution in the environment in rural parts of igp it is suggested that mass scale awareness generation programs are required and public involvement is sought at multiple levels by different state and non state actors to regulate and slow down the nitrate use for agricultural purposes similarly large scale groundwater quality monitoring and decimation of information regarding groundwater nitrate remediation and filtration are recommended to avoid health issues the government s effort to decimate the information to farmers about their soil health through soil health card scheme requires systematic analysis to measure the effectiveness in reducing pollution load similarly urban and rural local bodies and environmental agencies will have to implement more strict monitoring and other appropriate policy tools to regulate nitrate pollution in urban areas it is essential to investigate the mechanism regulating the nitrate pollutant in the aquifers of igp as it will reveal the factors responsible for the low nitrate level in the eastern igp therefore the isotopic studies for nitrate pollutant are highly suggested there is an urgent requirement for studies to be designed to investigate groundwater nitrate with other toxic co contaminates particularly uranium this will help in understanding the mobilization mechanism of nitrate uranium and other co contaminates from the aquifers there is need to investigate the proven methods to remediate groundwater nitrate such as mar paf and agroforestry along with the judicious application of fertilizers more research and regular monitoring are required in the eastern parts of igp especially in states like bihar which is becoming the top fertilizer consuming state in the country climate change will alter the hydrological processes with changes to surface water flow evaporation groundwater recharge groundwater level and flow these will impact the concentration of nitrate in groundwater therefore understanding these changes will help the future generation better deal with the complex impact of climate change 6 conclusion this work investigates the groundwater nitrate contamination of the indo gangetic plains igp by analyzing the groundwater geochemical data and hhr after analyzing a total of 94 research works on groundwater data from the igp and hhr the following outcomes were drawn i the presence of nitrate in groundwater exceeding the mpl of 45 mg l was observed throughout the igp ii groundwater in the northern and western parts were significantly contaminated with nitrate compared to eastern parts as only a few samples were reported to surpass the mpl in eastern parts of igp iii throughout the igp agricultural activities have been the dominant cause for the groundwater nitrate pollution particularly from the nitrogenous fertilizer consumption and iv groundwater in approximately 27 19 and 16 25 area of the igp may pose health risks to children adult males and females respectively the hhr caused by the nitrate in groundwater was more prevalent in the north western parts of igp and was consistent with the spatial distribution of groundwater nitrate contaminations reported in the works of literature importantly leakages from the septic tanks sewage drains and landfill sites and disposal of industrial wastes have been the primary reasons in urban regions finally based on this review and hhr assessment it can be said that nitrate in groundwater resources of the igp is ubiquitously observed and is majorly linked with the application of fertilizer and improper waste disposal from urban regions groundwater quality issues mainly remain invisible to the masses therefore great effort and collaboration are needed from the researcher policymakers regulators farming community and common people so that proper interventions can be designed and implemented to address groundwater nitrate pollution and achieve

11629,providing the population with high quality drinking water is one of the main tasks which has become particularly relevant in connection with the observed deterioration of the general environmental situation and excessive pollution of water supply sources this challenge is especially relevant for small towns underground water is widely used as a source of water supply for settlements a significant part of which has an excess concentration in several indicators including iron and ammonium compounds such water has a complex composition in terms of its processing when classical methods and schemes do not work the growth of populated areas the development of industry and the increasing requirements for water quality from various water users lead to the need to find rational methods of water treatment it has been established that ammonium nitrogen significantly makes it difficult the decrease the concentration of total iron to a normalizing value of 0 3 mg l and it is required to apply high air intensity 210 l min practically only a small part of air oxygen is spent on the oxidation of iron while even at a ratio of 5 1 in filters with sand loading the problem of reducing the concentration of ammonium nitrogen to the standard values is not solved the use of the proposed technological scheme with an aeration column will increase the degree of purification of underground water from iron and total ammonium nitrogen to values of 0 15 and 1 5 mg l respectively as well as reduce the cost of manufacturing the installation and the purification process due to the absence of expensive materials reagents and equipment in the scheme graphical abstract image 1 keywords underground water ammonium nitrogen water treatment de ironing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in most underground drinking water sources an increased iron concentration is observed however in addition to elevated concentrations of iron in underground water there are often excesses of nitrogen containing substances it is known that the combined presence of several pollutants can hinder the process of purification of natural waters gouzinis et al 1998 some of these components are iron manganese and ammonium nitrogen pradhan et al 2022 the water treatment process is usually solved quite effectively for large drinking water supply sources but this problem is relevant for small settlements despite the rather simple removal of iron and manganese the presence of ammonium nitrogen can significantly complicate their oxidation process zeng et al 2020 the most common technologies for underground water treatment and removing contaminants such as iron and similar elements are presented in table 1 organic nitrogen accounts for 50 75 of the total nitrogen dissolved in water poste et al 2014 nitrogen leaching from agricultural lands leads to the development of eutrophication processes in water bodies thus from 1 ha of irrigated land about 8 10 kg of nitrogen is washed away into water systems fox and rockström 2003 the main sources of ammonium nitrogen in natural waters include poste et al 2014 i decarboxylation during the breakdown of protein substances under the influence of bacterial and fungal decarboxylases and amination ii open water bodies including swampy areas iii seaweed iv atmospheric precipitation in which their concentration is close to that observed in surface waters v wastewater from various municipal agricultural and industrial enterprises it should be noted that all forms of nitrogen including gaseous are capable of mutual transformations myrold 2021 however most of the ammonium ions enter the water with runoff from livestock farms agricultural fields and industrial enterprises xin et al 2020 manu et al 2022 high values of ammonium content can be found in reservoirs or underground water located near municipal treatment facilities and sewerage fox and rockström 2003 ammonium nitrogen binds to other elements in water and can create highly toxic compounds excess levels of ammonium nitrogen and ammonia can give water a very unpleasant odor and taste moreover long term use of such water leads to a violation of the acid base balance in the body ammonium ions alkalize the blood plasma which can lead to cell hypoxia all this is not a complete list of problems caused by excess ammonium and ammonia in water according to who and eu standards the concentration of ammonium nitrogen should not exceed 2 mg l in accordance with the requirements of the global environmental monitoring system gems ammonium nitrogen nitrite and nitrate ions are included in the programs of mandatory observations of the composition of drinking water and are important indicators of the degree of pollution and the trophic status of surface and underground natural water resources simultaneous removal of several contaminants in natural water is a very complex process mainly due to the different values of the redox potential required for their oxidation this parameter affects the sequence of removal of these contaminants in the aquatic environment and thus affects the possibility of developing the sequence and number of necessary elements of the technological scheme for the purification of natural water of complex composition removal of iron and manganese is achieved quite easily due to simplified aeration and subsequent water filtering through a granular load the oxidation process occurs through two mechanisms romanovskii and khort 2017 to increase the efficiency of iron removal the use of modified granulated filter materials is most effective for example fireclay romanovski et al 2021 modified anthracites romanovski 2020 activated carbons propolsky et al 2020 some well known approaches include defferisation in aquifers hurynovich and ramanouski 2018 at present a number of approaches have been proposed to increase the efficiency of ammonium nitrogen removal from underground water for ammonia nitrogen removal both simple sorbents for example zeolites rožić et al 2000 some minerals schoeman 1986 coals le leuch and bandosz 2007 and more complex systems including in most cases biological treatment ribári and kollár 1991 have been proposed in some cases a simple reorganization of water and air flows in the filter can help to increase both iron and ammonium nitrogen removal yushchenko et al 2023 for example some options for complex biological purification from iron manganese ammonium and arsenic fu et al 2011 li et al 2013 algieri et al 2022 the use of membrane methods du et al 2017 trickling filters tekerlekopoulou and vayenas 2007 tekerlekopoulou et al 2010 and the use of granular materials with a biofilm homagai and poudel 2018 have been proposed it is also proposed to use strong oxidants such as hypochlorites yang et al 2021 and ozonation khuntia et al 2013 in some articles authors suggest using nanomaterials for example fecu nanocomposite chan et al

part of the vitebsk region belarus the composition of which is given in tables 2 and 3 2 2 sampling according to the monitoring results in the north western part of the vitebsk region belarus about 60 of underground water supply sources have a complex composition in this case not only iron exceed the standard values but also manganese and ammonia nitrogen which can influence the choice of water treatment technology specific oxygen demand for example air for the oxidation of iron 0 143 manganese 0 29 ammonium 3 6 mg l mg nie et al 2023 should also be taken into account sites with different

the water at the existing two iron removal stations in the polotsk district of the vitebsk region site 1 with the content of ammonium nitrogen in the water and with a similar composition of water but without the content of ammonium nitrogen in the water site 2 in order to increase the degree of water purification by providing the required amount of oxygen in the water a small water supply facility was selected the waters of an aquifer which contained iron and ammonium site 3 the composition of water from an underground source in the summer increases the concentration of iron is 3 5 mg l

indicators according to the standards the scheme of conducted experiments is shown in fig 1 2 3 iron removal filters in the existing deironing stations sites 1 and 2 a parallel technological operation

parameters were selected intensive aeration of air by a compressor up to 5 m3 per 1 m3 of water for higher oxygen saturation of water experiment 3 1 intensive aeration of air by a compressor for higher oxygen saturation of water and additional introduction of sodium hypochlorite with a dose of 7 0 mg of active chlorine per 1 l of treated water in front of the filters the water was then passed

laboratory scales magnetic stirrers membrane electrodes em no3 07 and evl 1m3 1 which have verification certificates for the period of research were used the indicators were determined after 10 h of filter operation after reaching the operating efficiency determination of the total iron concentration in treated underground water in pilot experiments was based on the interaction of iron ions in an alkaline medium with sulfosalicylic acid to form a yellow colored complex compound propolsky et al 2020 the raw and purified water ph was measured according to iso 10523 2009 ammonium ions were determined according to gost 33045 2014 method a and dissolved oxygen in the filtrate was determined using a portable waterproof oxygen meter ni9146 04 three samples were analyzed in parallel for each parameter 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of ammonium nitrogen on the composition and treatment of underground water the initial water in the settlements site 1 had an excess content of iron 3 5 mg l and manganese 0 14 mg l the existing plants operated in the original mode with an installed capacity of 2 5 m3 h august september during this time at a ratio of air and water 1 1 42 l min the concentration of iron in the filtrate decreased from 3 5 to 1 95 mg l manganese remained equal to the original 0 14 mg l which is much higher than the required standard values fig 3 the presence of manganese and iron in water lead to the film formation of manganese and iron oxides on the surface of the filter media granules which additionally help to catalyze oxidation romanovskii and khort 2017 during the experiment the air supply to the mixing was changed from 70 to 150 l min the ratio of air to water 1 68 3 6 1 with an increase of dissolved oxygen the oxidizing potential of the system increases and as a result the dissolved fe2 ions passed into fe3 which were further removed in the form of iron hydroxide on sand filters it is known romanovskii and khort 2017 that the rate of oxidation of ferrous iron to ferric iron increases with an increase in dissolved oxygen concentration as can be seen from fig 3a when the ratio of air and water supply to the filters is already more than 3 15 1 the concentration of total iron decreases to the standard value provided that there is no ammonium nitrogen in the water however the concentration of manganese practically did not decrease because the amount of oxygen was still insufficient for its oxidation bivalent manganese oxidizes much more slowly compared with iron at ph 8 without catalysts manganese oxidation practically does not occur fig 4 in such cases the use of reagent methods or modified loading should be considered installation on site 2 similarly worked for more than 3 months the results obtained during this time at a ratio of air and water of 1 1 and a productivity of 2 5 m3 h the concentration of iron decreased from 3 3 to 2 5 mg l manganese remained equal to the original 0 16 mg l ammonium nitrogen 2 5 mg l which was significantly higher compared to the required standard values fig 3b therefore the air supply of the compressor unit was increased to 210 l min the ratio of air to water 1 68 5 1 as a result when the ratio of air to water was more than 5 1 a decrease in iron was observed and the concentration for ammonium nitrogen changed within the normative limits but this cannot be indicated as a positive result the dependence of contaminants and dissolved oxygen concentrations on the different ratios of air to water is shown in fig 4b thus it has been established that in the presence of ammonium nitrogen the decrease in iron was significantly slowed down and it is required to apply a greater air intensity than in the absence of n nh4 based on the data obtained the following conclusions can be drawn in the absence of ammonium nitrogen the decrease in the total iron concentration to the standard value of 0 3 mg l occurs when the ratio of air to water was already more than 3 15 in the presence of ammonium nitrogen a decrease in the concentration of total iron to a normalizing value of 0 3 mg l occurs only when the ratio of air to water is more than 5 1 i e ammonium nitrogen significantly slows down the decrease in iron concentration and it is required to apply a high air intensity for ammonium nitrogen the concentration had limited values which cannot be called a positive result most likely the task of reducing the concentration of ammonium nitrogen was not solved in filters with a sandy load the normalizing value of the concentration of total manganese 0 1 mg l could not be achieved as practice shows this usually happens after 6 8 months of filter operation 3 2 oxidation of ammonium nitrogen in underground water by aeration and pre dosing of sodium hypochlorite experiment 1 the work of existing filters was analyzed during their operation rapid and significant clogging of the air vents and the entire loading layer was noted this suggests that such a technique for treating complexly contaminated underground water cannot work without improving the water treatment technology itself during operation in the variable water supply mode for a long time the residual concentrations for iron amounted to 2 6 3 5 mg l and for ammonium nitrogen 3 2 4 3 mg l the oxygen concentration in the water after the ejectors were 4 3 mgo2 l and was absent after the filters an audit and repair were carried out for the uniform operation of the water treatment plant additionally the connection of the existing water tower inside the water supply network was also carried out this made it possible to streamline the uniform operation of the water treatment station with a flow rate of 2 5 3 0 m3 h under operating in a constant water supply mode the residual concentration for iron was 1 8 2 6 mg l fig 4a and for ammonium nitrogen 3 2 4 3 mg l remained unchanged fig 5 b the concentration of oxygen in the water after the filters was also absent that means the existing treatment does not provide the standard values of total iron and ammonium nitrogen of 0 3 and 2 mg l respectively the concentration of manganese in the source water was 0 10 0 11 mg l and remained constant for the entire period of the experiments experiment 2 when the ejector was replaced with an aeration pressure vessel and a compressor the iron concentration in the purified water decreased to 1 2 1 6 mg l fig 5a the oxygen concentration in the water after the aerator increased to 6 8 mgo2 l but at the outlet it remained within the range of 0 2 0 5 mg l obviously an increase in the oxygen concentration after the aerator made it possible to increase the effect of iron removal but the desired result 0 3 mg l still wasn t achieved the reason was that the main stage of oxidation took place in relation to ammonium the concentration of which decreased to 2 8 3 2 mg l fig 5b but still remained higher than the allowable norm of 2 mg l that is the volume of air supplied by the ejector is not enough to oxidize all the impurities contained in the source water in addition for the efficient operation of the ejector a sufficiently intense and uniform flow of water is necessary otherwise the ejector will not suck air into the water after installing a compressor with an aeration column which allows more efficient mixing of oxygen with water and increases the duration of contact between air oxygen and water the efficiency of oxidation of dissolved impurities in water has noticeably increased and accordingly the cleaning effect has increased volumetric aeration makes it possible to remove excess oxygen from the air before it is fed to the filter experiment 3 1 the results of the study of the use of intensive aeration for water saturation with oxygen followed by filtration fig 6 shows that intensive aeration within 2 min led to a significant decrease of total iron content down to 0 27 mg l about 93 decrease at the same time the decrease of ammonium nitrogen was insignificant about 16 and kept small under intensive aeration for up to 10 min 2 3 mg l 45 decrease experiment 3 2 in one study zhai et al 2022 the authors noted that with the dosing of chlorine the efficiency of manganese removal increased significantly and reached a level of more than 80 corresponding to less than 0 1 mg l of mn2 at a dosage of chlorine of 3 mg l in the form of cl2 the authors noted that no significant increase in metal ion removal was observed at a higher chlorine dosage e g 5 mg l cl2 for our experiment the dosage of sodium hypochlorite with a dose of 7 0 mg of active chlorine per 1 l of treated water was selected as a sum of the next doses i residual dose of active chlorine dres 0 3 0 5 mg l ii dose of active chlorine for disinfection ddis 1 14 mg l iii doses of active chlorine needed for the oxidation of ferrous iron dox fe manganese dox mn oxidation of organic substances dox org the oxidation of 1 mg of ferrous iron consumes 0 64 mg of active chlorine manganese 1 29 mg of active chlorine and permanganate oxidizability 0 5 1 mg of active chlorine additional aeration of water and sodium hypochlorite dosage didn t result in removing ammonium nitrogen from the standard values table 2 the obtained results were pretty same as the obtained under experiment 3 1 this was also indicated by the low concentration of dissolved oxygen experimentally it should be 8 10 mgo2 l in addition the sample contained an increased content of residual chlorine which does not allow the use of this purification method for drinking water the results of the experiment are presented in table 2 experiment 3 3 the catalytic aluminosilicate sorbent ac acts as an oxidation catalyst in the reactions of the interaction of dissolved oxygen with iron ii compounds this sorbent s operation principle is similar to the modified materials published in the articles romanovskii and khort 2017 the use of the ac sorbent also makes it possible to increase the ph of the water to 1 0 1 5 units which additionally provides more efficient removal of iron after replacing part of the filter sand layer with ac sorbent at a ratio of 1 1 a positive result was achieved for residual iron sustainably below 0 3 mg l fig 5a the period between filter washing increased to over eight days but for ammonium nitrogen the residual concentrations in the treated water remained above the normative ones and were in the range of 2 5 2 6 mg l fig 5b experiment 4 at this stage it was decided to perform additional natural aeration in the cwt without hydraulic and mechanical mixing with the installation of additional second stage filters after pumps loaded with zeolite brand sorbent in a ratio of 1 1 with sand fig 7 a the temperature of water from an underground source was constant at the level of 8 10 с using secondary simple water aeration after filters and its supply to an additional filter loaded with zeolite sorbent second stage of filtration reduces the concentration of ammonium nitrogen to 20 which is often sufficient however at initial concentrations above four mg l the residual concentration was 2 1 2 3 mg l fig 5b the dissolved oxygen concentration was 2 2 5 mgo2 l this requires filter regeneration once per 2 days the amount of sodium chloride was 15 20 kg per 1 cycle of regeneration the disadvantages include the fact that the second stage of filters installed after the pumps operate according to the variable mode of the water supply system experiment 5 it was decided to increase the degree of secondary aeration by installing a separate second aeration column and the second stage of filters the experiments were carried out on the water after the first stage filters the water was passed through an aerator and then filtered through a filter loaded with zeolite in purified water the iron concentration decreased to 0 2 mg l fig 5a the oxygen concentration in the water after the second stage filters increased to 4 6 mgo2 l and ammonium didn t exceed 1 5 mg l fig 5b it brings about that the second stage filters can work alternately or simultaneously in the latter case the filters will be in operation only for part of the day so that the residual concentration of ammonium in the cwt does not exceed 2 mg l and nitrates 45 mg l in this case the estimated period of zeolite regeneration can be more than 7 days thus a next technological scheme has been developed for purifying underground water from iron and ammonium source water from a well compressor aeration column iron removal filters ac sorbent secondary aeration column with pahl rings second stage filters zeolite sorbent cwt network pumps cwt water supply network with a water tower this scheme allows for obtaining stable results for residual iron concentrations in the presence of ammonium nitrogen below the normative values fig 7 b the existing water treatment plant with an ejector aeration system and sand filled filters could not provide the normalized filtrate values of 0 3 mg l for total iron and 2 0 mg l for n nh4 it has been established that for stations with a capacity of up to 300 500 m3 day and containing both iron and ammonium nitrogen the method of simplified aeration using ejectors and subsequent filtration on sand filters does not allow to get standard values fig 5 with an ammonium nitrogen content of more than 2 0 mg l or nitrates of more than 45 mg l practically only an insignificant part of the oxygen in the air is spent on the oxidation of iron while the problem of nitrogen removal is not completely solved installing a pressurized aeration tank with air supplied by a compressor instead of the ejectors before the filters improves the iron removal process fig 5a but does not remove the ammonium nitrogen fig 5b it should be noted that the content of ammonium nitrogen over 0 7 0 8 mg l or nitrates over 25 mg l significantly complicates the processes of iron removal and it is desirable to use compressors instead of ejectors with an increase in the ratio of air to water up to 5 6 m3 m3 the use of ac type sorbent instead of sand in filters gives a stable high iron removal effect of 0 3 mg l or less fig 5a but also without reducing the ammonium fig 5b or nitrate content the use of additional regulation in clean water tanks followed by filtration on second stage filters allows obtaining results for iron less than 0 3 mg l fig 5a and practically normalized for ammonium nitrogen fig 5b in this case it is desirable to use a control tank with a forced ventilation device into which compressed air is supplied to remove ammonia approximately 3 m3 per 1 m3 of water however in these conditions the water treatment plant does not work stably primarily due to uneven operation of the second stage filters in addition these filters often have to be regenerated with sodium chloride solution stable results fig 5 of the water treatment were obtained using a second separate aeration column followed by filtration on filters of the second stage and only then was the filtrate sent to the cwt in particular cases an additional aeration column may contain raschig rings and have a smaller diameter than the aeration unit s aeration column which will provide intensive aeration at the lowest cost 4 conclusions the scientific novelty consists in i establishing the regularity of iron extraction in the presence of other pollutants in water and ii determining and developing the most efficient water treatment technology in relation to low capacity water supply systems under industrial conditions based on the obtained results next conclusions were drawn the article analyzes the efficiency of processing underground water from ammonium nitrogen and conducts an experiment to establish the individual effect of ammonium nitrogen on the removal of iron it has been established that in the absence of ammonium nitrogen the decrease in the concentration of total iron to the standard value of 0 3 mg l occurs when the ratio of air to water is more than 3 5 1 air intensity 150 l min in the presence of ammonium nitrogen the total iron concentration decreases when the air to water ratio is 5 1 air intensity 210 l min this suggests that ammonium nitrogen significantly slows down the decrease in total iron concentration and it is required to apply greater air intensity the second part of the research was carried out on pressure filters with a capacity of 2 5 m3 h with the development of a technological scheme for water purification that provides the required amount of oxygen in the water to oxidize all presented pollutants based on the results of the experiments it was found that for stations with a capacity of about 2 5 m3 h and with iron content in the source water up to 3 mg l and ammonium nitrogen over 4 0 mg l the existing scheme with an ejector aeration system and filters with sand loading could not provide normalized indicators in the filtrate of 0 3 mg l for total iron and 2 0 mg l n nh4 this is due to the fact that only a small part of the oxygen in the air is spent on the oxidation of iron while even at a ratio of 5 1 in filters with a sandy load the concentration of ammonia nitrogen does not decrease to standard values using ac type sorbent in filters instead of sand gives a stable high effect of removing iron of 0 3 mg l or less without reducing ammonium nitrogen 2 5 mg l the use of additional regulation in cwt with subsequent filtration on the second stage filters makes it possible to obtain results for iron less than 0 3 mg l and practically normalized for ammonium nitrogen 2 1 mg l finally stable results in the underground water treatment were obtained using a second separate aeration column followed by filtration on filters of the second stage and only then the filtrate is sent to the cwt residual content of iron 0 15 mg l ammonium 1 5 mg l in particular cases an additional aeration column may contain raschig rings and have a smaller diameter than the aeration column

11629,providing the population with high quality drinking water is one of the main tasks which has become particularly relevant in connection with the observed deterioration of the general environmental situation and excessive pollution of water supply sources this challenge is especially relevant for small towns underground water is widely used as a source of water supply for settlements a significant part of which has an excess concentration in several indicators including iron and ammonium compounds such water has a complex composition in terms of its processing when classical methods and schemes do not work the growth of populated areas the development of industry and the increasing requirements for water quality from various water users lead to the need to find rational methods of water treatment it has been established that ammonium nitrogen significantly makes it difficult the decrease the concentration of total iron to a normalizing value of 0 3 mg l and it is required to apply high air intensity 210 l min practically only a small part of air oxygen is spent on the oxidation of iron while even at a ratio of 5 1 in filters with sand loading the problem of reducing the concentration of ammonium nitrogen to the standard values is not solved the use of the proposed technological scheme with an aeration column will increase the degree of purification of underground water from iron and total ammonium nitrogen to values of 0 15 and 1 5 mg l respectively as well as reduce the cost of manufacturing the installation and the purification process due to the absence of expensive materials reagents and equipment in the scheme graphical abstract image 1 keywords underground water ammonium nitrogen water treatment de ironing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in most underground drinking water sources an increased iron concentration is observed however in addition to elevated concentrations of iron in underground water there are often excesses of nitrogen containing substances it is known that the combined presence of several pollutants can hinder the process of purification of natural waters gouzinis et al 1998 some of these components are iron manganese and ammonium nitrogen pradhan et al 2022 the water treatment process is usually solved quite effectively for large drinking water supply sources but this problem is relevant for small settlements despite the rather simple removal of iron and manganese the presence of ammonium nitrogen can significantly complicate their oxidation process zeng et al 2020 the most common technologies for underground water treatment and removing contaminants such as iron and similar elements are presented in table 1 organic nitrogen accounts for 50 75 of the total nitrogen dissolved in water poste et al 2014 nitrogen leaching from agricultural lands leads to the development of eutrophication processes in water bodies thus from 1 ha of irrigated land about 8 10 kg of nitrogen is washed away into water systems fox and rockström 2003 the main sources of ammonium nitrogen in natural waters include poste et al 2014 i decarboxylation during the breakdown of protein substances under the influence of bacterial and fungal decarboxylases and amination ii open water bodies including swampy areas iii seaweed iv atmospheric precipitation in which their concentration is close to that observed in surface waters v wastewater from various municipal agricultural and industrial enterprises it should be noted that all forms of nitrogen including gaseous are capable of mutual transformations myrold 2021 however most of the ammonium ions enter the water with runoff from livestock farms agricultural fields and industrial enterprises xin et al 2020 manu et al 2022 high values of ammonium content can be found in reservoirs or underground water located near municipal treatment facilities and sewerage fox and rockström 2003 ammonium nitrogen binds to other elements in water and can create highly toxic compounds excess levels of ammonium nitrogen and ammonia can give water a very unpleasant odor and taste moreover long term use of such water leads to a violation of the acid base balance in the body ammonium ions alkalize the blood plasma which can lead to cell hypoxia all this is not a complete list of problems caused by excess ammonium and ammonia in water according to who and eu standards the concentration of ammonium nitrogen should not exceed 2 mg l in accordance with the requirements of the global environmental monitoring system gems ammonium nitrogen nitrite and nitrate ions are included in the programs of mandatory observations of the composition of drinking water and are important indicators of the degree of pollution and the trophic status of surface and underground natural water resources simultaneous removal of several contaminants in natural water is a very complex process mainly due to the different values of the redox potential required for their oxidation this parameter affects the sequence of removal of these contaminants in the aquatic environment and thus affects the possibility of developing the sequence and number of necessary elements of the technological scheme for the purification of natural water of complex composition removal of iron and manganese is achieved quite easily due to simplified aeration and subsequent water filtering through a granular load the oxidation process occurs through two mechanisms romanovskii and khort 2017 to increase the efficiency of iron removal the use of modified granulated filter materials is most effective for example fireclay romanovski et al 2021 modified anthracites romanovski 2020 activated carbons propolsky et al 2020 some well known approaches include defferisation in aquifers hurynovich and ramanouski 2018 at present a number of approaches have been proposed to increase the efficiency of ammonium nitrogen removal from underground water for ammonia nitrogen removal both simple sorbents for example zeolites rožić et al 2000 some minerals schoeman 1986 coals le leuch and bandosz 2007 and more complex systems including in most cases biological treatment ribári and kollár 1991 have been proposed in some cases a simple reorganization of water and air flows in the filter can help to increase both iron and ammonium nitrogen removal yushchenko et al 2023 for example some options for complex biological purification from iron manganese ammonium and arsenic fu et al 2011 li et al 2013 algieri et al 2022 the use of membrane methods du et al 2017 trickling filters tekerlekopoulou and vayenas 2007 tekerlekopoulou et al 2010 and the use of granular materials with a biofilm homagai and poudel 2018 have been proposed it is also proposed to use strong oxidants such as hypochlorites yang et al 2021 and ozonation khuntia et al 2013 in some articles authors suggest using nanomaterials for example fecu nanocomposite chan et al 2021 or nanosized titanium dioxide el shafey et al 2021 from the point of view of rationality the next approaches can be considered as promising i the use of new granular materials since they are already used in existing iron removal filters romanovski 2020 propolsky et al 2020 ii and the use of hypochlorites since sodium hypochlorite is also used for disinfection water supply facilities ramanouski et al 2013 romanovski et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 first the assessment of the operation of existing technological schemes of water supply facilities with the possibility of their reconstruction and modernization should be analyzed recent publications on this topic in high ranking journals like the removal of ammonia using biofiltration processes said et al 2022 koike et al 2022 nie et al 2023 ultrafiltration ye et al 2022 using granulated loads novembre et al 2022 by prechlorination choo et al 2005 and some others al ajeel et al 2022 zhai et al 2022 confirm the relevance of these studies and their significance for providing a population with quality water this work aims to study the features of the treatment of underground water containing iron and ammonia compounds and to develop a technology for treating underground water of complex composition reducing the cost of manufacturing the installation and the water treatment process to achieve this goal the following tasks were identified and solved i study the efficiency of removing ammonium compounds from natural water and its individual effect on the removal of iron present in water ii exploring possible alternative solutions for the removal of iron and ammonium nitrogen iii carrying out research on pressurized filters with the development of a water purification process flowsheet that provides the required amount of oxygen in the water to oxidize all pollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 underground water characteristics the object of research was underground water in the western part of the vitebsk region belarus the composition of which is given in tables 2 and 3 2 2 sampling according to the monitoring results in the north western part of the vitebsk region belarus about 60 of underground water supply sources have a complex composition in this case not only iron exceed the standard values but also manganese and ammonia nitrogen which can influence the choice of water treatment technology specific oxygen demand for example air for the oxidation of iron 0 143 manganese 0 29 ammonium 3 6 mg l mg nie et al 2023 should also be taken into account sites with different content of ammonium nitrogen in water were selected to investigate its influence on the removal of iron and manganese the source water quality corresponded to the following parameters iron 3 3 3 5 mg l manganese 0 11 0 16 mg l and ammonium nitrogen 2 6 mg l permanganate oxidizability 3 5 3 6 mg l ph values 7 2 7 3 and eh 100 mv the studies were carried out by changing the amount of air supplied to the water at the existing two iron removal stations in the polotsk district of the vitebsk region site 1 with the content of ammonium nitrogen in the water and with a similar composition of water but without the content of ammonium nitrogen in the water site 2 in order to increase the degree of water purification by providing the required amount of oxygen in the water a small water supply facility

parameters were selected intensive aeration of air by a compressor up to 5 m3 per 1 m3 of water for higher oxygen saturation of water experiment 3 1 intensive aeration of air by a compressor for higher oxygen saturation of water and additional introduction of sodium hypochlorite with a dose of 7 0 mg of active chlorine per 1 l of treated water in front of the filters the water was then passed

laboratory scales magnetic stirrers membrane electrodes em no3 07 and evl 1m3 1 which have verification certificates for the period of research were used the indicators were determined after 10 h of filter operation after reaching the operating efficiency determination of the total iron concentration in treated underground water in pilot experiments was based on the interaction of iron ions in an alkaline medium with sulfosalicylic acid to form a yellow colored complex compound propolsky et al 2020 the raw and purified water ph was measured according to iso 10523 2009 ammonium ions were determined according to gost 33045 2014 method a and dissolved oxygen in the filtrate was determined using a portable waterproof oxygen meter ni9146 04 three samples were analyzed in parallel for each parameter 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of ammonium nitrogen on the composition and treatment of underground water the initial water in the settlements site 1 had an excess content of iron 3 5 mg l and manganese 0 14 mg l the existing plants operated in the original mode with an installed capacity of 2 5 m3 h august september during this time at a ratio of air and water 1 1 42 l min the concentration of iron in the filtrate decreased from 3 5 to 1 95 mg l manganese remained equal to the original 0 14 mg l which is much higher than the required standard values fig 3 the presence of manganese and iron in water lead to the film formation of manganese and iron oxides on the surface of the filter media granules which additionally help to catalyze oxidation romanovskii and khort 2017 during the experiment the air supply to the mixing was changed from 70 to 150 l min the ratio of air to water 1 68 3 6 1 with an increase of dissolved oxygen the oxidizing potential of the system increases and as a result the dissolved fe2 ions passed into fe3 which were further removed in the form of iron hydroxide on sand filters it is known romanovskii and khort 2017 that the rate of oxidation of ferrous iron to ferric iron increases with an increase in dissolved oxygen concentration as can be seen from fig 3a when the ratio of air and water supply to the filters is already more than 3 15 1 the concentration of total iron decreases to the standard value provided that there is no ammonium nitrogen in the water however the concentration of manganese practically did not decrease because the amount of oxygen was still insufficient for its oxidation bivalent manganese oxidizes much more slowly compared with iron at ph 8 without catalysts manganese oxidation practically does not occur fig 4 in such cases the use of reagent methods or modified loading should be considered installation on site 2 similarly worked for more than 3 months the results obtained during this time at a ratio of air and water of 1 1 and a productivity of 2 5 m3 h the concentration of iron decreased from 3 3 to 2 5 mg l manganese remained equal to the original 0 16 mg l ammonium nitrogen 2 5 mg l which was significantly higher compared to the required standard values fig 3b therefore the air supply of the compressor unit was increased to 210 l min the ratio of air to water 1 68 5 1 as a result when the ratio of air to water was more than 5 1 a decrease in iron was observed and the concentration for ammonium nitrogen changed within the normative limits but this cannot be indicated as a positive result the dependence of contaminants and dissolved oxygen concentrations on the different ratios of air to water is shown in fig 4b thus it has been established that in the presence of ammonium nitrogen the decrease in iron was significantly slowed down and it is required to apply a greater air intensity than in the absence of n nh4 based on the data obtained the following conclusions can be drawn in the absence of ammonium nitrogen the decrease in the total iron concentration to the standard value of 0 3 mg l occurs when the ratio of air to water was already more than 3 15 in the presence of ammonium nitrogen a decrease in the concentration of total iron to a normalizing value of 0 3 mg l occurs only when the ratio of air to water is more than 5 1 i e ammonium nitrogen significantly slows down the decrease in iron concentration and it is required to apply a high air intensity for ammonium nitrogen the concentration had limited values which cannot be called a positive result most likely the task of reducing the concentration of ammonium nitrogen was not solved in filters with a sandy load the normalizing value of the concentration of total manganese 0 1 mg l could not be achieved as practice shows this usually happens after 6 8 months of filter operation 3 2 oxidation of ammonium nitrogen in underground water by aeration and pre dosing of sodium hypochlorite experiment 1 the work of existing filters was analyzed during their operation rapid and significant clogging of the air vents and the entire loading layer was noted this suggests that such a technique for treating complexly contaminated underground water cannot work without improving the water treatment technology itself during operation in the variable water supply mode for a long time the residual concentrations for iron amounted to 2 6 3 5 mg l and for ammonium nitrogen 3 2 4 3 mg l the oxygen concentration in the water after the ejectors were 4 3 mgo2 l and was absent after the filters an audit and repair were carried out for the uniform operation of the water treatment plant additionally the connection of the existing water tower inside the water supply network was also carried out this made it possible to streamline the uniform operation of the water treatment station with a flow rate of 2 5 3 0 m3 h under operating in a constant water supply mode the residual concentration for iron was 1 8 2 6 mg l fig 4a and for ammonium nitrogen 3 2 4 3 mg l remained unchanged fig 5 b the concentration of oxygen in the water after the filters was also absent that means the existing treatment does not provide the standard values of total iron and ammonium nitrogen of 0 3 and 2 mg l respectively the concentration of manganese in the source water was 0 10 0 11 mg l and remained constant for the entire period of the experiments experiment 2 when the ejector was replaced with an aeration pressure vessel and a compressor the iron concentration in the purified water decreased to 1 2 1 6 mg l fig 5a the oxygen concentration in the water after the aerator increased to 6 8 mgo2 l but at the outlet it remained within the range of 0 2 0 5 mg l obviously an increase in the oxygen concentration after the aerator made it possible to increase the effect of iron removal but the desired result 0 3 mg l still wasn t achieved the reason was that the main stage of oxidation took place in relation to ammonium the concentration of which decreased to 2 8 3 2 mg l fig 5b but still remained higher than the allowable norm of 2 mg l that is the volume of air supplied by the ejector is not enough to oxidize all the impurities contained in the source water in addition for the efficient operation of the ejector a sufficiently intense and uniform flow of water is necessary otherwise the ejector will not suck air into the water after installing a compressor with an aeration column which allows more efficient mixing of oxygen with water and increases the duration of contact between air oxygen and water the efficiency of oxidation of dissolved impurities in water has noticeably increased and accordingly the cleaning effect has increased volumetric aeration makes it possible to remove excess oxygen from the air before it is fed to the filter experiment 3 1 the results of the study of the use of intensive aeration for water saturation with oxygen followed by filtration fig 6 shows that intensive aeration within 2 min led to a significant decrease of total iron content down to 0 27 mg l about 93 decrease at the same time the decrease of ammonium nitrogen was insignificant about 16 and kept small under intensive aeration for up to 10 min 2 3 mg l 45 decrease experiment 3 2 in one study zhai et al 2022 the authors noted that with the dosing of chlorine the efficiency of manganese removal increased significantly and reached a level of more than 80 corresponding to less than 0 1 mg l of mn2 at a dosage of chlorine of 3 mg l in the form of cl2 the authors noted that no significant increase in metal ion removal was observed at a higher chlorine dosage e g 5 mg l cl2 for our experiment the dosage of sodium hypochlorite with a dose of 7 0 mg of active chlorine per 1 l of treated water was selected as a sum of the next doses i residual dose of active chlorine dres 0 3 0 5 mg l ii dose of active chlorine for disinfection ddis 1 14 mg l iii doses of active chlorine needed for the oxidation of ferrous iron dox fe manganese dox mn oxidation of organic substances dox org the oxidation of 1 mg of ferrous iron consumes 0 64 mg of active chlorine manganese 1 29 mg of active chlorine and permanganate oxidizability 0 5 1 mg of active chlorine additional aeration of water and sodium hypochlorite dosage didn t result in removing ammonium nitrogen from the standard values table 2 the obtained results were pretty same as the obtained under experiment 3 1 this was also indicated by the low concentration of dissolved oxygen experimentally it should be 8 10 mgo2 l in addition the sample contained an increased content of residual chlorine which does not allow the use of this purification method for drinking water the results of the experiment are presented in table 2 experiment 3 3 the catalytic aluminosilicate sorbent ac acts as an oxidation catalyst in the reactions of the interaction of dissolved oxygen with iron ii compounds this sorbent s operation principle is similar to the modified materials published in the articles romanovskii and khort 2017 the use of the ac sorbent also makes it possible to increase the ph of the water to 1 0 1 5 units which additionally provides more efficient removal of iron after replacing part of the filter sand layer with ac sorbent at a ratio of 1 1 a positive result was achieved for residual iron sustainably below 0 3 mg l fig 5a the period between filter washing increased to over eight days but for ammonium nitrogen the residual concentrations in the treated water remained above the normative ones and were in the range of 2 5 2 6 mg l fig 5b experiment 4 at this stage it was decided to perform additional natural aeration in the cwt without hydraulic and mechanical mixing with the installation of additional second stage filters after pumps loaded with zeolite brand sorbent in a ratio of 1 1 with sand fig 7 a the temperature of water from an underground source was constant at the level of 8 10 с using secondary simple water aeration after filters and its supply to an additional filter loaded with zeolite sorbent second stage of filtration reduces the concentration of ammonium nitrogen to 20 which is often sufficient however at initial concentrations above four mg l the residual concentration was 2 1 2 3 mg l fig 5b the dissolved oxygen concentration was 2 2 5 mgo2 l this requires filter regeneration once per 2 days the amount of sodium chloride was 15 20 kg per 1 cycle of regeneration the disadvantages include the fact that the second stage of filters installed after the pumps operate according to the variable mode of the water supply system experiment 5 it was decided to increase the degree of secondary aeration by installing a separate second aeration column and the second stage of filters the experiments were carried out on the water after the first stage filters the water was passed through an aerator and then filtered through a filter loaded with zeolite in purified water the iron concentration decreased to 0 2 mg l fig 5a the oxygen concentration in the water after the second stage filters increased to 4 6 mgo2 l and ammonium didn t exceed 1 5 mg l fig 5b it brings about that the second stage filters can work alternately or simultaneously in the latter case the filters will be in operation only for part of the day so that the residual concentration of ammonium in the cwt does not exceed 2 mg l and nitrates 45 mg l in this case the estimated period of zeolite regeneration can be more than 7 days thus a next technological scheme has been developed for purifying underground water from iron and ammonium source water from a well compressor aeration column iron removal filters ac sorbent secondary aeration column with pahl rings second stage filters zeolite sorbent cwt network pumps cwt water supply network with a water tower this scheme allows for obtaining stable results for residual iron concentrations in the presence of ammonium nitrogen below the normative values fig 7 b the existing water treatment plant with an ejector aeration system and sand filled filters could not provide the normalized filtrate values of 0 3 mg l for total iron and 2 0 mg l for n nh4 it has been established that for stations with a capacity of up to 300 500 m3 day and containing both iron and ammonium nitrogen the method of simplified aeration using ejectors and subsequent filtration on sand filters does not allow to get standard values fig 5 with an ammonium nitrogen content of more than 2 0 mg l or nitrates of more than 45 mg l practically only an insignificant part of the oxygen in the air is spent on the oxidation of iron while the problem of nitrogen removal is not completely solved installing a pressurized aeration tank with air supplied by a compressor instead of the ejectors before the filters improves the iron removal process fig 5a but does not remove the ammonium nitrogen fig 5b it should be noted that the content of ammonium nitrogen over 0 7 0 8 mg l or nitrates over 25 mg l significantly complicates the processes of iron removal and it is desirable to use compressors instead of ejectors with an increase in the ratio of air to water up to 5 6 m3 m3 the use of ac type sorbent instead of sand in filters gives a stable high iron removal effect of 0 3 mg l or less fig 5a but also without reducing the ammonium fig 5b or nitrate content the use of additional regulation in clean water tanks followed by filtration on second stage filters allows obtaining results for iron less than 0 3 mg l fig 5a and practically normalized for ammonium nitrogen fig 5b in this case it is desirable to use a control tank with a forced ventilation device into which compressed air is supplied to remove ammonia approximately 3 m3 per 1 m3 of water however in these conditions the water treatment plant does not work stably primarily due to uneven operation of the second stage filters in addition these filters often have to be regenerated with sodium chloride solution stable results fig 5 of the water treatment were obtained using a second separate aeration column followed by filtration on filters of the second stage and only then was the filtrate sent to the cwt in particular cases an additional aeration column may contain raschig rings and have a smaller diameter than the aeration unit s aeration column which will provide intensive aeration at the lowest cost 4 conclusions the scientific novelty consists in i establishing the regularity of iron extraction in the presence of other pollutants in water and ii determining and developing the most efficient water treatment technology in relation to low capacity water supply systems under industrial conditions based on the obtained results next conclusions were drawn the article analyzes the efficiency of processing underground water from ammonium nitrogen and conducts an experiment to establish the individual effect of ammonium nitrogen on the removal of iron it has been established that in the absence of ammonium nitrogen the decrease in the concentration of total iron to the standard value of 0 3 mg l occurs when the ratio of air to water is more than 3 5 1 air intensity 150 l min in the presence of ammonium nitrogen the total iron concentration decreases when the air to water ratio is 5 1 air intensity 210 l min this suggests that ammonium nitrogen significantly slows down the decrease in total iron concentration and it is required to apply greater air intensity the second part of the research was carried out on pressure filters with a capacity of 2 5 m3 h with the development of a technological scheme for water purification that provides the required amount of oxygen in the water to oxidize all presented pollutants based on the results of the experiments it was found that for stations with a capacity of about 2 5 m3 h and with iron content in the source water up to 3 mg l and ammonium nitrogen over 4 0 mg l the existing scheme with an ejector aeration system and filters with sand loading could not provide normalized indicators in the filtrate of 0 3 mg l for total iron and 2 0 mg l n nh4 this is due to the fact that only a small part of the oxygen in the air is spent on the oxidation of iron while even at a ratio of 5 1 in filters with a sandy load the concentration of ammonia nitrogen does not decrease to standard values using ac type sorbent in filters instead of sand gives a stable high effect of removing iron of 0 3 mg l or less without reducing ammonium nitrogen 2 5 mg l the use of additional regulation in cwt with subsequent filtration on the second stage filters makes it possible to obtain results for iron less than 0 3 mg l and practically normalized for ammonium nitrogen 2 1 mg l finally stable results in the underground water treatment were obtained using a second separate aeration column followed by filtration on filters of the second stage and only then the filtrate is sent to the cwt residual content of iron 0 15 mg l ammonium 1 5 mg l in particular cases an additional aeration column may contain raschig rings and have a smaller diameter than the aeration column
