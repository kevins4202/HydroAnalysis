5430,macroscopic modeling approaches based on the solution of the richards equation with root water uptake rwu as a sink term can help in understanding soil water plant interactions within the rhizosphere however these models currently cannot capture the differences in rwu attributed to variations in plant health errors in simulating rwu from unhealthy plants are significant when disease causing fungus inhibits water uptake rather than other usually considered plant stresses we developed rwu reduction functions to simulate plant transpiration under combined water and disease stress conditions using linear and non linear response models the developed functions were implemented in the numerical model hydrus 2d 3d to simulate water uptake from a root system in a radially symmetrical flow domain field experiments were conducted in the vidarbha region of central india for one crop cycle on four citrus trees with varying disease intensities healthy to severely diseased the proposed model was rigorously tested by comparing its results with measured soil water contents and plant transpiration fluxes under various water and disease limiting conditions error in simulating rwu fluxes from unhealthy trees by ignoring the disease stress factor was found to be significant 15 for slightly diseased to 26 for the severely diseased tree parameters of the spatial root distribution and the disease stress response functions were optimized for each scenario using a genetic algorithm approach our results indicate that calibration targets to validate uptake reduction functions should be chosen cautiously based on the dominant stress experienced by the plant root system keywords root water uptake water stress disease stress citrus hydrus central india 1 introduction the plant root system is a primary pathway for the exchange of water and energy between the soil environment and the atmosphere zheng and wang 2015 the morphology spatial distribution and water uptake mechanism of the root system controls several hydrological fluxes including evapotranspiration soil moisture and drainage canadell et al 1996 accurate quantification of root water uptake rwu and characterization of its temporal variability can help in optimizing irrigation schedules and improving crop productivity for sustainable development schröder et al 2009 the assessment of rwu can also help in understanding the movement of nutrients and other chemicals in the vadose zone for solute transport studies somma et al 1998 vrugt et al 2001b several variably saturated water flow models that simulate soil water plant interactions within the rhizosphere including swap kroes et al 2000 and hydrus šimůnek et al 2008 2016 can analyze the role of site specific irrigation and management practices on crop production skaggs et al 2006 however these models work on the assumption that the plant is healthy and do not impose any stress on rwu resulting from the disease severity based on the representation of complex structure and geometry of roots in the soil water flow equation rwu from the vadose zone can be modeled using two approaches i e microscopic and macroscopic in the microscopic approach the geometry of individual roots is approximated by an infinitely long cylinder of uniform radius and water absorbent properties e g gardner 1960 philip 1957 the soil water flow equation is then analytically solved in a radial domain with the flow into the root driven by a product of the water potential gradient and the soil hydraulic conductivity šimůnek and hopmans 2009 however this method considers steady state conditions that rarely exist in field situations feddes and raats 2004 yadav et al 2009 also this method requires detailed knowledge of the geometry of the root system which is difficult to measure and hence limits its application to simple root systems deb et al 2013 vrugt et al 2001b in the macroscopic approach the richards equation is numerically solved with rwu represented by an empirical sink term averaged over the system of roots vrugt et al 2001b 1 θ t k h z s x y z t where θ is the volumetric water content cm3cm 3 k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity tensor cm s 1 h is the soil water matric potential the pressure head cm and s is an empirical sink representing rwu cm3cm 3s 1 the macroscopic approach is widely used in numerical models since it requires easy to measure and or estimate parameters including the soil water potential plant transpiration and root density wang et al 2015 the sink term s in eq 1 defines the volume of water removed by rwu from a unit volume of soil per time this can be represented using i water transfer models that are based on the water pressure head gradient at the soil root interface and a depth dependent root density function e g feddes et al 1974 gardner 1964 molz 1981 or ii transpiration based models that depend on the atmospheric demand and a spatially varied root distribution function e g belmans et al 1983 šimůnek et al 1994 wu and cosgrove 2000 zuo et al 2004 in the former case the root density function is primarily dependent on soil hydraulic properties whereas in the latter case it represents root morphology and architecture in the spatial domain skaggs et al 2006 owing to a simple representation and reliable estimation of the atmospheric demand from meteorological parameters the transpiration based rwu functions are commonly adopted gardner 1960 and have the form 2 s p x y z t β x y z t pot l t where s p is the potential rwu that could occur from a water unlimited saline free and healthy root system β x y z is a normalized root density distribution function cm 3 t pot is potential transpiration cm s 1 that depends on meteorological conditions and leaf properties van den berg et al 2002 and lt is the surface area associated with transpiration cm2 several empirical equations were proposed in the literature to model β x y z e g feddes and zaradny 1978 hao et al 2005 vrugt et al 2001b wu and cosgrove 2000 these functions largely differ in terms of representing the shape linear exponential or trapezoidal and scale parameters of the root system actual rwu under prevailing agrometeorological conditions can be obtained as 3 s a x y z t γ h φ s p x y z t where sa is actual rwu occurring from a natural root system and γ h φ is a dimensionless stress response function 0 γ h φ 1 representing the stress factors that reduce potential rwu due to non optimal conditions that exist during crop growth such as a the water stress α h that reduces rwu due to sub optimal soil water pressure head h and can be modeled using either a piece wise linear reduction function feddes and zaradny 1978 or a continuous s shape reduction function van genuchten and jury 1987 and b the salinity stress α φ that reduces rwu due to the osmotic head φ and can be modeled considering the relation between the whole plant water use and yield loss van genuchten and hoffman 1984 maas and hoffman 1977 almost all water uptake reduction functions proposed in the literature are based on abiotic drought salinity nutrient stresses encountered by a plant however the plant water consumption can also be hampered by biotic bacteria viruses fungi stresses which primarily reduce the ability of roots to absorb water by lowering the crop water consumption and associated yield rejeb et al 2014 for the same irrigation and water management conditions it is well known that a diseased tree consumes less water than a healthy tree it is difficult to modify existing abiotic stress functions to account for both abiotic and biotic stresses as the inter dependence of these stresses can result in different rwu patterns atkinson and urwin 2012 fujita et al 2006 the effect of soil borne diseases on the uptake mechanism was never explored from the hydrological perspective hence questioning the applicability of existing models to simulate rwu from disease affected trees peddinti et al 2018 in the co existence of multiple uptake reduction factors of varying strengths it is crucial to dynamically quantify appropriate stresses that a plant experiences so that effective management strategies can be implemented peddinti et al 2018 highlighted the role of plant health in simulating rwu from disease citrus trees however they failed to develop stress response functions that consider plant health conditions for the use with numerical models and irrigation scheduling the vidarbha region in maharashtra india is the leading producer of mandarin oranges citrus reticulate accounting for 40 of the country s citrus production with a yield of 6 t ha 1 far below the nation s average peddinti et al 2018 the low citrus production in vidarbha is primarily attributed to improper management activities that result in the formation and propagation of a water mold disease called root rot phytophthora spp under favorable conditions high soil moisture and cold temperature the disease causing fungus produces a large number of motile zoospores that move towards the roots these zoospores contact the root system then encyst germinate and enter the root tip resulting in the rot of the entire rootlet savita and nagpal 2012 these root pathogens can damage the tree by decreasing the root density and water and nutrient uptake duniway 1971 it is almost impossible to identify early stage symptoms of this disease which originates in the rhizosphere jagtap et al 2012 late stage impressions of a disease affected tree are seen at the surface with symptoms including leafless branches yellow foliage shoot dieback reduced fruit size and yield thin canopy and reduced water and nutrient uptake zekri and rouse 2007 the disease intensity can be estimated by measuring the population density of phytophthora spp in the soil surrounding the root zone and is expressed on a scale of 0 healthy to 4 severely diseased gade et al 2006 gade and koche 2012 the disease intensity has a strong negative correlation with biomass and crop yield choudhari et al 2018 a disease affected tree inhibits rwu resulting in higher soil water contents a condition favorable for further growth of disease causing fungus in order to evaluate alternate irrigation and management practices for citrus trees of different health conditions it is imperative to accurately represent rwu from disease affected trees using numerical tools the objectives of this research are i to formulate linear and non linear disease stress response functions and implement them in a numerical model to simulate rwu from citrus trees ii to evaluate the applicability of disease stress response functions in the presence and absence of water stress conditions and iii to derive optimal root distribution and disease sensing parameters for use with numerical models and the operational management of citrus trees 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and data acquisition factorial field scale experiments were conducted on four matured citrus trees of varying health conditions located in the nagziri village of maharashtra india latitude 21 27 5 n longitude 78 9 12 e elevation 460 m asl agrometeorological conditions at the experimental site were discussed in peddinti et al 2018 the selection of trees was made based on the visual disease symptoms at the surface gade and koche 2012 these include a healthy tree with no yellowing t1 a tree with 10 25 yellowing of leaves with oozing lesions of 1 cm2 area t2 a tree with 25 50 yellowing of leaves with oozing lesions of 2 5 cm2 area t3 and a tree with more than 50 yellowing of leaves with oozing lesions of 5 cm2 area t4 phenological and disease characteristics of the experimental trees are presented in table 1 electrical resistivity tomography ert was proven to be an effective method to monitor soil moisture profiles at a high spatial resolution within the root zone of orange trees cassiani et al 2015 a square grid of 2 8 m by 2 8 m having 40 surface electrodes δ x 0 4 m δ y 0 7 m with an orange tree located at the center was laid to monitor root zone water contents fig 1 the reliability of ert to estimate soil water contents was tested using gravimetric measurements at selective depths plant transpiration was measured using sfm1 sap flow meters ict international armidale nsw australia that were placed in the tree trunk at the height of 0 5 m above the ground in four citrus trees fig 1 the sap flow meter utilizes a heat ratio method to measure high low and reverse sap flows using a set of three 35 mm stainless steel needles placed at 5 mm spacing sap flows were monitored at 15 min interval and accumulated over each day the hydraulic gradient across the root zone was estimated using tensiometers placed along the vertical axis fig 1 and drainage fluxes across the bottom boundary were estimated using darcy s law whitaker 1986 2 2 laboratory estimation of soil properties undisturbed soil samples were collected in cylindrical cores height 13 cm diameter 10 cm from a representative depth of 30 cm surrounding each experimental plot these samples were used to estimate soil physical and electrical properties in the laboratory under controlled conditions table 1 texturally the soil is classified as vertisol having high expansive clay content and water holding capacity with a swell index of 55 virmani et al 1982 soil suctions and moisture contents during the drying phase were estimated using dew point potentiometer and gravimetric methods respectively the van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 shape parameters α and n were estimated using the retc code van genuchten et al 1991 that considers the constitutive relationships given by 4 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α v ψ n m ψ 0 θ s ψ 0 where θ r a n d θ s a r e the residual and saturated soil water contents c m 3 c m 3 respectively α v is the reciprocal of air entry ψ c m 1 n is a pore size distribution index with m 1 1 n the non linear relation between electrical resistivity and soil moisture was developed following astm guidelines astm g57 06 2012 a simplified form of waxman and smits 1968 was fitted to the data using the constitutive relation given by 5 σ a θ c b where σ s m 1 is the electrical conductivity of a soil sample θ c m 3 c m 3 is the soil volumetric water content with a s m 1 b s m 1 and c being the best fit parameters a comprehensive description and methodology for laboratory estimation of pedo physical and pedo electrical relations can be found in peddinti et al 2018 inoculum dynamics for the four trees t1 through t4 were observed at weekly intervals to characterize disease intensity soil cores from four corners of each tree located at 75 cm distance from the trunk were pooled to make the composite soil about 10 cm3 of soil from the homogeneous sample was added to 90 ml of 0 025 percent agar and 1 ml of the slurry was plated on phytophthora selective medium tsao and stephen 1977 plates were then incubated at 27 c for three days and phytophthora colonies were counted using a microscope and reported as a propagule count per cc of soil pc gade and koche 2012 2 3 root water uptake model for isolated trees such as citrus in large monocultures the process of water uptake is complex and hence requires a three dimensional representation of the spatial root distribution green and clothier 1998 the distribution of soil moisture following the irrigation of citrus trees has been found to be symmetric in the x y plane and hence considering an isotropic distribution of rwu in the lateral direction is appropriate peddinti et al 2018 since the root distribution function proposed by vrugt et al 2001a can be readily tested with numerical tools such as hydrus and has the scale and shape parameters that can be readily modified it is ideal for characterizing the root morphology and simulating rwu keeping these points in view we have adopted the two dimensional axisymmetric form of the root distribution function proposed by vrugt et al 2001a to model rwu of the citrus trees in the study area 6 β r z 1 z z m 1 r r m e p z z m z z p r r m r r where β r z is the shape function describing the spatial root distribution cm 2 zm and rm are the maximum rooting depth cm and the maximum radial distance cm respectively z and r are the empirical parameters that control the position of the maximum uptake intensity cm and pz and pr are the empirical parameters that control the shape of the root distribution these empirical parameters are constrained to provide zero rwu at z zm r rm and maximum rwu at z and r normalized rwu from the citrus root system s p cm3cm 3s 1 considering the atmospheric demand is given by 7 s p r z β r z t p l t 2 4 uptake reduction functions eq 7 is applicable to estimate potential rwu from a healthy tree subjected to stress free conditions in the presence of uptake reduction stresses actual rwu s a cm3cm 3s 1 is given by 8 s a r z γ h φ p c s p r z where γ h φ p c is the total stress experienced by the plant root system involving both biotic and abiotic components the integration of the above equation over the spatial domain gives cumulative actual rwu from the root system which is equal to actual plant transpiration ta vrugt et al 2001b šimůnek and hopmans 2009 commonly used abiotic uptake reduction factors include the water stress α h and the salinity stress α φ which depend on the pressure head and the osmotic head respectively fujimaki et al 2008 when the assumption of disease free conditions is violated biotic pathogens in the rhizosphere can cause an additional reduction in rwu and the plant is said to experience the disease stress α pc in reality all these stresses can coexist during the crop cycle hence their integrated effect on rwu needs to be simulated the combined effect of all possible uptake reduction factors can be described using either additive or multiplicative approaches of individual stresses experienced by the plant it is still under debate which approach can best describe the plant water uptake more accurately fujimaki et al 2008 šimůnek and hopmans 2009 2 4 1 water stress response function to account for the reduction in rwu resulting from changes in soil moisture between irrigations piece wise linear and non linear response functions are often used feddes and zaradny 1978 van genuchten and jury 1987 the piece wise linear model is parameterized using four thresholds of the soil water pressure head between a permanent wilting point and full saturation with h 4 h 3 h 2 h 1 the water stress response function α h used in this study is given as feddes and zaradny 1978 9 α h h h 4 h 3 h 4 h 3 h h 4 1 h 2 h h 3 h 2 h h 3 h h 1 h 2 h 1 h 1 h h 2 0 h h 4 o r h h 1 2 4 2 disease stress response function peddinti et al 2018 concluded that ignoring plant health conditions in the numerical models can result in significant deviations in simulated rwu fluxes particularly from disease affected trees in this research the disease level of a citrus tree is quantified using the population density of phytophthora spp i e propagule count pc per a unit volume of soil cfu g 1 and is represented on a scale of 0 healthy with no yellowing to 4 severely affected with more than 50 yellowing and leaf fall gade et al 2006 several researchers have concluded that pc changes during crop growth stages have a strong correlation with soil moisture and yield loss bright et al 2004 gade and koche 2012 we considered the yield data from 30 mature citrus trees of the region with varying disease intensities to obtain a functional form of the water uptake reduction function due to plant disease conditions α p c fig 2 because of the differences in frequency and amount of irrigation between crop growth stages we defined stage specific parameters while formulating the disease stress response function for the observed citrus trees the range in pc is highest during the growth stage 20 35 followed by the flowering stage 9 20 and the harvest stage 4 15 increased frequency and irrigation amounts during the growth stage has resulted in swampy environment and high soil moisture a condition favorable for further growth of disease causing bacteria first we proposed a segmented linear function of the form 10 α p c 1 pc pc min 1 p c pc min γ pc min p c pc max α min pc pc max where α min is the lowest possible uptake factor that is possible from a disease affected tree pc min and pc max are the minimum and maximum thresholds for pc that results in unit and α min uptake factors respectively and γ is the slope of the linear function note that γ can be evaluated directly from pc min pc max and α min similarly a nonlinear or s shaped continuous smooth function is postulated to simulate the effects of plant health on rwu 11 α p c 1 1 pc pc 50 p 3 where pc 50 and p 3 are the empirical parameters with pc 50 representing the soil pc at which α p c becomes 0 5 2 4 3 combined water and disease stress we assume that the two stress functions disease and water are solely caused by changes in pc and water potential respectively and are independent of each other even though pc has an indirect relationship with the soil water potential this relationship is yet unexplored and hence difficult to implement with eq 9 since the soil water potential is explicitly included in the water stress function this assumption seems to be meaningful in reality plants show different degrees of sensitivity to water and disease stress conditions rejeb et al 2014 we assumed that the effects of water and disease stress on the uptake reduction are independent and hence their integrated effect γ h p c can be obtained using a multiplication rule skaggs et al 2006 šimůnek and hopmans 2009 12 γ h p c α h α p c where γ h pc ranges from 1 healthy water unlimited to 0 severe disease water stress and is always less than or equal to α h and α p c 2 4 4 numerical implementation the proposed linear and non linear disease stress response functions eqs 10 and 11 were implemented in hydrus 2d 3d šimůnek et al 2016 2008 to simulate either individual or simultaneous effects of water and disease stresses on rwu both static z m r m p z p r z r and dynamic pc min pc max α min or pc 50 p 3 parameters of the rwu function were varied during model calibration to minimize the discrepancy between measured and simulated soil water contents as well as plant transpiration fluxes 2 5 model calibration and performance evaluation the proposed model was calibrated for different water pre and post irrigation and disease limiting conditions t1 to t4 using the spatial distribution of water contents and whole plant transpiration fluxes a global sensitivity analysis was performed using the sobol s method sobol 2001 to reveal critical parameters of each function and to determine the contribution of the uncertainty of each parameter to the uncertainty of the model output the first order s i and total order sensitivity s ti indices were approximated by a numerical monte carlo estimation proposed by saltelli et al 2010 the static root distribution parameters and the stage specific disease stress function parameters were transformed into their defined parameter intervals based on the specified minimum and maximum values parameter limits on the rooting depth and radial distance were observed from the ert profiles whereas the other root distribution parameters were taken from the literature a total of 1000 parameter sets were considered to develop the first order and total order sensitivity indices optimization was performed using a genetic algorithm ga to reveal the optimal set of the most sensitive parameters vrugt et al 2001b gas were developed based on the evolution theory inspired by natural selection and genetics and aimed to solve complex optimization problems the root distribution and disease stress response function parameters were optimized by calibrating the model against soil water contents and plant transpiration fluxes respectively since the inverse module of hydrus 2d 3d is not set to optimize these parameters the ga toolbox in matlab was coupled with the forward computational module of hydrus 2d 3d to perform the calibration the ga was run with 1000 initial parameter sets a penalty factor of 10 a population size of 1000 a crossover fraction of 0 5 and a mutation rate of 0 05 during optimization two point cross over and uniform mutation functions were used with the ga solver goldberg and holland 1988 eight markov chain runs with a set of 1000 generations were utilized to minimize the errors in hydrus 2d 3d simulated water contents model performance was evaluated using the statistical indices that include the root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r 2 cai et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of soil moisture profiles from ert spatiotemporal patterns of the soil water content surrounding the citrus tree were obtained by performing 3d ert experiments before and after each irrigation application during each watering citrus trees were flood irrigated to a depth of about 35 40 mm to replicate the field practices six irrigation applications were considered during the monitoring period table 2 and a typical ert generated soil moisture profile is presented in fig 3 before the interpretation of the results ert data quality and noise reduction were ensured using reciprocal errors and stacking sreeparvathy et al 2019 calibrated time domain reflectometry tdr probes placed at four depths 15 30 45 and 60 cm below the ground level were used to correlate with ert measurements ert derived soil moisture data was in agreement with tdr observations r2 0 65 rmse 0 03 cm3 cm 3 error range 0 04 to 0 08 n 21 and hence were considered as observed soil water contents for use with hydrus 2d 3d calibration it can be observed that irrespective of the health condition soil moisture profiles are visibly distinct between pre and post irrigation scenarios since no lithological anomalies were reported these changes in soil water contents can be attributed to the root zone activity cassiani et al 2015 peddinti et al 2018 before irrigation water stress conditions the soil moisture front that separates the active root zone from the bottom soil layers is clearly visible from the ert profiles fig 3 the depth of the soil moisture front was decreasing from 47 cm for a healthy matured tree t1 to 35 cm for a severely diseased citrus tree t4 as the disease intensity progresses from t1 to t4 the root zone is observed to be attenuating in radial and depth directions for the same applied irrigation water and evaporation losses relatively high soil water contents under a diseased tree following irrigation no water stress condition were observed due to less rwu low photosynthetic activity of diseased trees due to a reduction in lai and chlorophyll contents could be an additional cause even though healthy and unhealthy trees have recorded similar temporal moisture patterns their values differed significantly ert results led to the conclusion that ignoring the health condition of a tree in the numerical model can result in high rwu from diseased trees due to the absence of the water stress which is in contrary to the field measurements 3 2 numerical simulations with hydrus 2d 3d an axisymmetric form of the richards equation for water flow under unsaturated conditions around the citrus tree with rwu represented by an external sink term was numerically solved the finite element mesh along with the applicable boundary conditions is shown in fig 4 the generated mesh with a mesh refinement around the root zone consisted of 8884 nodes 346 1d elements and 17 420 2d elements the model refinement is chosen to achieve a tradeoff between computational cost and numerical convergence the flow domain has a length of 250 cm in the radial direction and 100 cm in the depth direction the upper boundary of the flow domain represents the land surface subjected to atmospheric and irrigation fluxes and was assigned an atmospheric boundary condition since the groundwater table depth 4 6 m is well below the root zone the bottom boundary was assigned a free drainage boundary condition to allow gravitational drainage fluxes following irrigation which were estimated using darcy s equation all remaining boundaries were assumed to represent no flow conditions the upper boundary conditions were assigned using a daily time step for 110 days 09 sep to 27 dec 2017 daily meteorological data was obtained from an automatic weather station aws located at about 30 m from the experimental site the reference evapotranspiration et 0 was estimated using the fao based penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and is in the range of 2 to 8 mm day et 0 was further partitioned into evaporative e 0 and transpiration t 0 demands using the methodology proposed by ritchie 1972 and is validated using flux partitioning methodology peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 rwu is considered as a system dependent boundary condition and is adjusted during the simulation depending on the state variables water and disease stresses rwu is equal to potential transpiration from a healthy irrigated plant and is limited by the lack of soil moisture and or plant health conditions two disease stress response functions linear and non linear models were incorporated into the hydrus 2d 3d code using time varying stage specific pc values since hydrus 2d 3d does not have a dedicated calibration tool for root distribution and disease sensing parameters it was coupled with the ga tool in matlab to perform calibration and parameter estimation the variance based sensitivity analysis using sobol s algorithm was performed to reveal the contribution of individual parameters and their interactions on simulated soil water and transpiration fluxes the detailed results of the sensitivity analysis are available as supplementary material model parameterization and optimization were performed by considering model sensitive parameters root distribution parameters that are sensitive to soil water simulations and their optimal values for each experimental tree are given in table 3 it can be observed that the parameters defining the shape of the spatial root distribution pz and pr are insensitive to model simulations as discussed below in section 3 5 the β r z function for different experimental trees is governed exclusively by scale parameters in the depth and radial directions the ert domain was discretized in such a way that the grid cells of ert and hydrus 2d 3d coincide as much as possible to minimize the interpolation errors model calibration was achieved by matching i simulated soil water contents with ert measurements and ii simulated whole plant transpiration fluxes with sap flow measurements a good agreement between simulated and observed soil water contents was achieved during water limiting pre irrigation and water available post irrigation conditions fig 5 overall hydrus 2d 3d was able to capture the soil moisture profiles for t1 r 2 0 71 rmse 0 032 n 230 t2 r 2 0 74 rmse 0 026 n 230 t3 r 2 0 69 rmse 0 039 n 230 and t4 r 2 0 78 rmse 0 021 n 230 scenarios 3 3 evaluation of disease stress response functions to be consistent with the commonly used water and salinity stress response models we developed piece wise linear and s shaped nonlinear disease stress response functions fig 2 for use with hydrus 2d 3d simulations however the pc of disease causing bacteria was observed to change dynamically during the crop cycle and was controlled by soil water contents and crop phenology fig 2 hence we divided the crop cycle into three stages flowering doy90 135 growth doy136 287 and harvest doy288 365 to define the stage specific functional parameters daily plots of rwu from the experimental plots using the two models are presented in fig 6 both models produced similar rwu patterns during the simulations with marginally different magnitudes during the simulation daily rwu was in the range of 0 05 to 0 46 cm d using a linear stress function and 0 01 to 0 34 cm d using a nonlinear stress function lumped over all experimental trees the linear stress response function yielded slightly higher rwu 0 20 0 08 cm d in comparison to the non linear model 0 16 0 06 cm d cumulative rwu from the four experimental trees t1 through t4 using a linear stress response function were found to be 28 07 25 48 20 84 and 13 54 cm respectively and their counterparts using a nonlinear stress response function were found to be 20 34 19 91 17 75 and 11 54 cm respectively rwu from the linear stress response function was in close agreement with observed transpiration fluxes in comparison to the non linear model daily rwu fluxes simulated using a linear stress response function from a healthy citrus tree t1 for growth and harvest stages were 0 29 0 06 cm d and 0 18 0 03 cm d respectively and the corresponding values from a severely diseased citrus tree t4 were 0 146 0 04 cm d and 0 08 0 01 cm d respectively similarly daily rwu fluxes simulated using a non linear stress response function from a healthy citrus trees t1 for the growth and harvest stages were 0 21 0 04 cm and 0 12 0 01 cm d respectively and the corresponding values from a severely diseased citrus tree t4 were 0 13 0 03 cm d and 0 07 0 01 cm d respectively temporal patterns of rwu averaged over each crop stage can be approximated by a unimodal distribution with low rwu during the flowering stage highest during the growth stage followed by a decreasing trend towards the harvest interestingly this pattern coincides with the pc fig 2 and irrigation frequency this indicates that plant transpiration is sensitive to the pc and applied irrigation water with varying strengths hence the application of irrigation water to disease affected trees during the crop growth stage is more crucial for the effective management of citrus trees parameters of the disease stress response function were optimized for each crop growth stage using linear and nonlinear functions and are presented in table 4 it can be observed that differences between optimized parameters are relatively small between different experimental plots for a given growth stage and relatively large between different growth stages this indicates that it is important to consider time variable disease sensing parameters such as pc 50 p 3 pc max pc min α min to effectively simulate rwu from diseased trees scatter plots of actual transpiration rwu simulated using the two disease stress reduction models along with observed whole plant transpiration fluxes are shown in fig 7 results showed that the rwu fluxes simulated using the piece wise linear stress response function are clustered around the 1 1 line for all scenarios t2 through t4 even though there is some scatter and bias in the estimates it can be observed that the magnitude of underestimation of rwu fluxes deviations from the 1 1 line when the non linear stress response function is used diminishes towards severely disease affected trees t4 this indicates that for severely diseased trees both linear and non linear stress functions give similar predictions close to observed rwu fluxes in other words the bias in estimated daily rwu fluxes is high for a slightly diseased tree t2 and gradually diminishes as the disease severity progresses we attribute this change to variations in model parameters 3 4 propagation of the error in simulated rwu due to ignorance of disease stress to quantify the error and its magnitude in the estimated rwu fluxes from unhealthy trees as a function of disease intensity hydrus 2d 3d simulations were repeated without considering the disease stress response function a healthy citrus tree t1 for which the disease stress function is not applicable had slightly higher simulated transpiration fluxes fig 8 in reality the ubiquitous influence of low pc from healthy trees might inhibit rwu resulting in low observed transpiration to match with hydrus 2d 3d adjusts its root distribution parameters yet achieving significantly deviated rwu fluxes a similar yet significant deviation was observed for other disease affected trees t2 through t4 indicating that consideration of a compensationmechanism to lower simulated rwu is essential the error in simulated rwu from unhealthy trees when ignoring the α pc component i e the difference in box plots of without disease stress and observed transpiration was found to be in the range of 15 to 26 fig 8 it can be observed that for diseased trees of varying intensities t2 through t4 actual transpiration simulated by considering the disease stress response function matched almost perfectly with the observed values having the same range and median values 3 5 spatial distribution of rwu from citrus trees the spatial representation of root water uptake β r z from the experimental trees is illustrated in fig 9 it can be observed that the zone of maximum rwu is located in a thin soil layer that varies from 0 2 m for t4 to about 0 32 m for t1 this zone can be designated as an external sink region that drives soil water flow towards active roots a healthy citrus tree t1 has a larger rooting depth and radius compared to the other three diseased trees it can be observed that the shape of the root distribution function remains the same for all experimental trees this indicates that the health condition of a tree has a significant impact on the scale parameters of the root distribution function the close spacing of contours for a diseased tree indicates that pathogens are inhibiting the water uptake mechanism thereby minimizing the spatial extent of rwu we also conclude that measured plant transpiration fluxes are more useful than measured water content for calibration of soil water plant models from diseased trees 3 6 limitations of research the proposed disease stress functions are applicable to citrus orchards family with similar agro climatic conditions and hence cannot be generalized to other plants we assumed that the two stress functions are independent of each other when evaluating their combined effect on rwu simulations which may not be accurate in reality we could not compare the simulated transpiration fluxes with observations during the flowering stage due to the absence of sap flow measurements the proposed idea can be taken further to develop similar disease stress response functions applicable to different crops of various agro climatic conditions 4 summary and conclusions this research provides an insight into soil water disease interactions of citrus trees using combined experimental and numerical studies field experiments were conducted at four citrus trees of varying health conditions located in the vidarbha region of india to monitor hydrological and root water uptake fluxes in response to irrigation soil water contents and rwu within the rhizosphere were monitored using 3d ert measurements and sap flow meters respectively ert results revealed that a diseased tree consumes less water resulting in higher soil water contents in the root zone a condition favorable to further growth of the fungus an axisymmetric form of the richards equation with the root distribution function proposed by vrugt et al 2001a was then numerically solved using hydrus 2d 3d the reduction in rwu due to the disease stress was modeled using piece wise linear and s shaped non linear functions and their applicability to simulate rwu was evaluated in the presence of the water stress parameters of the disease stress response function were specified by defining thresholds of pc of bacterial pathogens for each crop growth stage optimal root distribution and disease stress function parameters for each scenario were obtained using a genetic algorithm errors in simulating rwu from un healthy tress by ignoring the disease stress condition was observed to be in the range of 15 26 our results indicate that model calibration using plant transpiration data can accurately quantify rwu fluxes from diseased trees declaration of

5430,macroscopic modeling approaches based on the solution of the richards equation with root water uptake rwu as a sink term can help in understanding soil water plant interactions within the rhizosphere however these models currently cannot capture the differences in rwu attributed to variations in plant health errors in simulating rwu from unhealthy plants are significant when disease causing fungus inhibits water uptake rather than other usually considered plant stresses we developed rwu reduction functions to simulate plant transpiration under combined water and disease stress conditions using linear and non linear response models the developed functions were implemented in the numerical model hydrus 2d 3d to simulate water uptake from a root system in a radially symmetrical flow domain field experiments were conducted in the vidarbha region of central india for one crop cycle on four citrus trees with varying disease intensities healthy to severely diseased the proposed model was rigorously tested by comparing its results with measured soil water contents and plant transpiration fluxes under various water and disease limiting conditions error in simulating rwu fluxes from unhealthy trees by ignoring the disease stress factor was found to be significant 15 for slightly diseased to 26 for the severely diseased tree parameters of the spatial root distribution and the disease stress response functions were optimized for each scenario using a genetic algorithm approach our results indicate that calibration targets to validate uptake reduction functions should be chosen cautiously based on the dominant stress experienced by the plant root system keywords root water uptake water stress disease stress citrus hydrus central india 1 introduction the plant root system is a primary pathway for the exchange of water and energy between the soil environment and the atmosphere zheng and wang 2015 the morphology spatial distribution and water uptake mechanism of the root system controls several hydrological fluxes including evapotranspiration soil moisture and drainage canadell et al 1996 accurate quantification of root water uptake rwu and characterization of its temporal variability can help in optimizing irrigation schedules and improving crop productivity for sustainable development schröder et al 2009 the assessment of rwu can also help in understanding the movement of nutrients and other chemicals in the vadose zone for solute transport studies somma et al 1998 vrugt et al 2001b several variably saturated water flow models that simulate soil water plant interactions within the rhizosphere including swap kroes et al 2000 and hydrus šimůnek et al 2008 2016 can analyze the role of site specific irrigation and management practices on crop production skaggs et al 2006 however these models work on the assumption that the plant is healthy and do not impose any stress on rwu resulting from the disease severity based on the representation of complex structure and geometry of roots in the soil water flow equation rwu from the vadose zone can be modeled using two approaches i e microscopic and macroscopic in the microscopic approach the geometry of individual roots is approximated by an infinitely long cylinder of uniform radius and water absorbent properties e g gardner 1960 philip 1957 the soil water flow equation is then analytically solved in a radial domain with the flow into the root driven by a product of the water potential gradient and the soil hydraulic conductivity šimůnek and hopmans 2009 however this method considers steady state conditions that rarely exist in field situations feddes and raats 2004 yadav et al 2009 also this method requires detailed knowledge of the geometry of the root system which is difficult to measure and hence limits its application to simple root systems deb et al 2013 vrugt et al 2001b in the macroscopic approach the richards equation is numerically solved with rwu represented by an empirical sink term averaged over the system of roots vrugt et al 2001b 1 θ t k h z s x y z t where θ is the volumetric water content cm3cm 3 k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity tensor cm s 1 h is the soil water matric potential the pressure head cm and s is an empirical sink representing rwu cm3cm 3s 1 the macroscopic approach is widely used in numerical models since it requires easy to measure and or estimate parameters including the soil water potential plant transpiration and root density wang et al 2015 the sink term s in eq 1 defines the volume of water removed by rwu from a unit volume of soil per time this can be represented using i water transfer models that are based on the water pressure head gradient at the soil root interface and a depth dependent root density function e g feddes et al 1974 gardner 1964 molz 1981 or ii transpiration based models that depend on the atmospheric demand and a spatially varied root distribution function e g belmans et al 1983 šimůnek et al 1994 wu and cosgrove 2000 zuo et al 2004 in the former case the root density function is primarily dependent on soil hydraulic properties whereas in the latter case it represents root morphology and architecture in the spatial domain skaggs et al 2006 owing to a simple representation and reliable estimation of the atmospheric demand from meteorological parameters the transpiration based rwu functions are commonly adopted gardner 1960 and have the form 2 s p x y z t β x y z t pot l t where s p is the potential rwu that could occur from a water unlimited saline free and healthy root system β x y z is a normalized root density distribution function cm 3 t pot is potential transpiration cm s 1 that depends on meteorological conditions and leaf properties van den berg et al 2002 and lt is the surface area associated with transpiration cm2 several empirical equations were proposed in the literature to model β x y z e g feddes and zaradny 1978 hao et al 2005 vrugt et al 2001b wu and cosgrove 2000 these functions largely differ in terms of representing the shape linear exponential or trapezoidal and scale parameters of the root system actual rwu under prevailing agrometeorological conditions can be obtained as 3 s a x y z t γ h φ s p x y z t where sa is actual rwu occurring from a natural root system and γ h φ is a dimensionless stress response function 0 γ h φ 1 representing the stress factors that reduce potential rwu due to non optimal conditions that exist during crop growth such as a the water stress α h that reduces rwu due to sub optimal soil water pressure head h and can be modeled using either a piece wise linear reduction function feddes and zaradny 1978 or a continuous s shape reduction function van genuchten and jury 1987 and b the salinity stress α φ that reduces rwu due to the osmotic head φ and can be modeled considering the relation between the whole plant water use and yield loss van genuchten and hoffman 1984 maas and hoffman 1977 almost all water uptake reduction functions proposed in the literature are based on abiotic drought salinity nutrient stresses encountered by a plant however the plant water consumption can also be hampered by biotic bacteria viruses fungi stresses which primarily reduce the ability of roots to absorb water by lowering the crop water consumption and associated yield rejeb et al 2014 for the same irrigation and water management conditions it is well known that a diseased tree consumes less water than a healthy tree it is difficult to modify existing abiotic stress functions to account for both abiotic and biotic stresses as the inter dependence of these stresses can result in different rwu patterns atkinson and urwin 2012 fujita et al 2006 the effect of soil borne diseases on the uptake mechanism was never explored from the hydrological perspective hence questioning the applicability of existing models to simulate rwu from disease affected trees peddinti et al 2018 in the co existence of multiple uptake reduction factors of varying strengths it is crucial to dynamically quantify appropriate stresses that a plant experiences so that effective management strategies can be implemented peddinti et al 2018 highlighted the role of plant health in simulating rwu from disease citrus trees however they failed to develop stress response functions that consider plant health conditions for the use with numerical models and irrigation scheduling the vidarbha region in maharashtra india is the leading producer of mandarin oranges citrus reticulate accounting for 40 of the country s citrus production with a yield of 6 t ha 1 far below the nation s average peddinti et al 2018 the low citrus production in vidarbha is primarily attributed to improper management activities that result in the formation and propagation of a water mold disease called root rot phytophthora spp under favorable conditions high soil moisture and cold temperature the disease causing fungus produces a large number of motile zoospores that move towards the roots these zoospores contact the root system then encyst germinate and enter the root tip resulting in the rot of the entire rootlet savita and nagpal 2012 these root pathogens can damage the tree by decreasing the root density and water and nutrient uptake duniway 1971 it is almost impossible to identify early stage symptoms of this disease which originates in the rhizosphere jagtap et al 2012 late stage impressions of a disease affected tree are seen at the surface with symptoms including leafless branches yellow foliage shoot dieback reduced fruit size and yield thin canopy and reduced water and nutrient uptake zekri and rouse 2007 the disease intensity can be estimated by measuring the population density of phytophthora spp in the soil surrounding the root zone and is expressed on a scale of 0 healthy to 4 severely diseased gade et al 2006 gade and koche 2012 the disease intensity has a strong negative correlation with biomass and crop yield choudhari et al 2018 a disease affected tree inhibits rwu resulting in higher soil water contents a condition favorable for further growth of disease causing fungus in order to evaluate alternate irrigation and management practices for citrus trees of different health conditions it is imperative to accurately represent rwu from disease affected trees using numerical tools the objectives of this research are i to formulate linear and non linear disease stress response functions and implement them in a numerical model to simulate rwu from citrus trees ii to evaluate the applicability of disease stress response functions in the presence and absence of water stress conditions and iii to derive optimal root distribution and disease sensing parameters for use with numerical models and the operational management of citrus trees 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and data acquisition factorial field scale experiments were conducted on four matured citrus trees of varying health conditions located in the nagziri village of maharashtra india latitude 21 27 5 n longitude 78 9 12 e elevation 460 m asl agrometeorological conditions at the experimental site were discussed in peddinti et al 2018 the selection of trees was made based on the visual disease symptoms at the surface gade and koche 2012 these include a healthy tree with no yellowing t1 a tree with 10 25 yellowing of leaves with oozing lesions of 1 cm2 area t2 a tree with 25 50 yellowing of leaves with oozing lesions of 2 5 cm2 area t3 and a tree with more than 50 yellowing of leaves with oozing lesions of 5 cm2 area t4 phenological and disease characteristics of the experimental trees are presented in table 1 electrical resistivity tomography ert was proven to be an effective method to monitor soil moisture profiles at a high spatial resolution within the root zone of orange trees cassiani et al 2015 a square grid of 2 8 m by 2 8 m having 40 surface electrodes δ x 0 4 m δ y 0 7 m with an orange tree located at the center was laid to monitor root zone water contents fig 1 the reliability of ert to estimate soil water contents was tested using gravimetric measurements at selective depths plant transpiration was measured using sfm1 sap flow meters ict international armidale nsw australia that were placed in the tree trunk at the height of 0 5 m above the ground in four citrus trees fig 1 the sap flow meter utilizes a heat ratio method to measure high low and reverse sap flows using a set of three 35 mm stainless steel needles placed at 5 mm spacing sap flows were monitored at 15 min interval and accumulated over each day the hydraulic gradient across the root zone was estimated using tensiometers placed along the vertical axis fig 1 and drainage fluxes across the bottom boundary were estimated using darcy s law whitaker 1986 2 2 laboratory estimation of soil properties undisturbed soil samples were collected in cylindrical cores height 13 cm diameter 10 cm from a representative depth of 30 cm surrounding each experimental plot these samples were used to estimate soil physical and electrical properties in the laboratory under controlled conditions table 1 texturally the soil is classified as vertisol having high expansive clay content and water holding capacity with a swell index of 55 virmani et al 1982 soil suctions and moisture contents during the drying phase were estimated using dew point potentiometer and gravimetric methods respectively the van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 shape parameters α and n were estimated using the retc code van genuchten et al 1991 that considers the constitutive relationships given by 4 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 α v ψ n m ψ 0 θ s ψ 0 where θ r a n d θ s a r e the residual and saturated soil water contents c m 3 c m 3 respectively α v is the reciprocal of air entry ψ c m 1 n is a pore size distribution index with m 1 1 n the non linear relation between electrical resistivity and soil moisture was developed following astm guidelines astm g57 06 2012 a simplified form of waxman and smits 1968 was fitted to the data using the constitutive relation given by 5 σ a θ c b where σ s m 1 is the electrical conductivity of a soil sample θ c m 3 c m 3 is the soil volumetric water content with a s m 1 b s m 1 and c being the best fit parameters a comprehensive description and methodology for laboratory estimation of pedo physical and pedo electrical relations can be found in peddinti et al 2018 inoculum dynamics for the four trees t1 through t4 were observed at weekly intervals to characterize disease intensity soil cores from four corners of each tree located at 75 cm distance from the trunk were pooled to make the composite soil about 10 cm3 of soil from the homogeneous sample was added to 90 ml of 0 025 percent agar and 1 ml of the slurry was plated on phytophthora selective medium tsao and stephen 1977 plates were then incubated at 27 c for three days and phytophthora colonies were counted using a microscope and reported as a propagule count per cc of soil pc gade and koche 2012 2 3 root water uptake model for isolated trees such as citrus in large monocultures the process of water uptake is complex and hence requires a three dimensional representation of the spatial root distribution green and clothier 1998 the distribution of soil moisture following the irrigation of citrus trees has been found to be symmetric in the x y plane and hence considering an isotropic distribution of rwu in the lateral direction is appropriate peddinti et al 2018 since the root distribution function proposed by vrugt et al 2001a can be readily tested with numerical tools such as hydrus and has the scale and shape parameters that can be readily modified it is ideal for characterizing the root morphology and simulating rwu keeping these points in view we have adopted the two dimensional axisymmetric form of the root distribution function proposed by vrugt et al 2001a to model rwu of the citrus trees in the study area 6 β r z 1 z z m 1 r r m e p z z m z z p r r m r r where β r z is the shape function describing the spatial root distribution cm 2 zm and rm are the maximum rooting depth cm and the maximum radial distance cm respectively z and r are the empirical parameters that control the position of the maximum uptake intensity cm and pz and pr are the empirical parameters that control the shape of the root distribution these empirical parameters are constrained to provide zero rwu at z zm r rm and maximum rwu at z and r normalized rwu from the citrus root system s p cm3cm 3s 1 considering the atmospheric demand is given by 7 s p r z β r z t p l t 2 4 uptake reduction functions eq 7 is applicable to estimate potential rwu from a healthy tree subjected to stress free conditions in the presence of uptake reduction stresses actual rwu s a cm3cm 3s 1 is given by 8 s a r z γ h φ p c s p r z where γ h φ p c is the total stress experienced by the plant root system involving both biotic and abiotic components the integration of the above equation over the spatial domain gives cumulative actual rwu from the root system which is equal to actual plant transpiration ta vrugt et al 2001b šimůnek and hopmans 2009 commonly used abiotic uptake reduction factors include the water stress α h and the salinity stress α φ which depend on the pressure head and the osmotic head respectively fujimaki et al 2008 when the assumption of disease free conditions is violated biotic pathogens in the rhizosphere can cause an additional reduction in rwu and the plant is said to experience the disease stress α pc in reality all these stresses can coexist during the crop cycle hence their integrated effect on rwu needs to be simulated the combined effect of all possible uptake reduction factors can be described using either additive or multiplicative approaches of individual stresses experienced by the plant it is still under debate which approach can best describe the plant water uptake more accurately fujimaki et al 2008 šimůnek and hopmans 2009 2 4 1 water stress response function to account for the reduction in rwu resulting from changes in soil moisture between irrigations piece wise linear and non linear response functions are often used feddes and zaradny 1978 van genuchten and jury 1987 the piece wise linear model is parameterized using four thresholds of the soil water pressure head between a permanent wilting point and full saturation with h 4 h 3 h 2 h 1 the water stress response function α h used in this study is given as feddes and zaradny 1978 9 α h h h 4 h 3 h 4 h 3 h h 4 1 h 2 h h 3 h 2 h h 3 h h 1 h 2 h 1 h 1 h h 2 0 h h 4 o r h h 1 2 4 2 disease stress response function peddinti et al 2018 concluded that ignoring plant health conditions in the numerical models can result in significant deviations in simulated rwu fluxes particularly from disease affected trees in this research the disease level of a citrus tree is quantified using the population density of phytophthora spp i e propagule count pc per a unit volume of soil cfu g 1 and is represented on a scale of 0 healthy with no yellowing to 4 severely affected with more than 50 yellowing and leaf fall gade et al 2006 several researchers have concluded that pc changes during crop growth stages have a strong correlation with soil moisture and yield loss bright et al 2004 gade and koche 2012 we considered the yield data from 30 mature citrus trees of the region with varying disease intensities to obtain a functional form of the water uptake reduction function due to plant disease conditions α p c fig 2 because of the differences in frequency and amount of irrigation between crop growth stages we defined stage specific parameters while formulating the disease stress response function for the observed citrus trees the range in pc is highest during the growth stage 20 35 followed by the flowering stage 9 20 and the harvest stage 4 15 increased frequency and irrigation amounts during the growth stage has resulted in swampy environment and high soil moisture a condition favorable for further growth of disease causing bacteria first we proposed a segmented linear function of the form 10 α p c 1 pc pc min 1 p c pc min γ pc min p c pc max α min pc pc max where α min is the lowest possible uptake factor that is possible from a disease affected tree pc min and pc max are the minimum and maximum thresholds for pc that results in unit and α min uptake factors respectively and γ is the slope of the linear function note that γ can be evaluated directly from pc min pc max and α min similarly a nonlinear or s shaped continuous smooth function is postulated to simulate the effects of plant health on rwu 11 α p c 1 1 pc pc 50 p 3 where pc 50 and p 3 are the empirical parameters with pc 50 representing the soil pc at which α p c becomes 0 5 2 4 3 combined water and disease stress we assume that the two stress functions disease and water are solely caused by changes in pc and water potential respectively and are independent of each other even though pc has an indirect relationship with the soil water potential this relationship is yet unexplored and hence difficult to implement with eq 9 since the soil water potential is explicitly included in the water stress function this assumption seems to be meaningful in reality plants show different degrees of sensitivity to water and disease stress conditions rejeb et al 2014 we assumed that the effects of water and disease stress on the uptake reduction are independent and hence their integrated effect γ h p c can be obtained using a multiplication rule skaggs et al 2006 šimůnek and hopmans 2009 12 γ h p c α h α p c where γ h pc ranges from 1 healthy water unlimited to 0 severe disease water stress and is always less than or equal to α h and α p c 2 4 4 numerical implementation the proposed linear and non linear disease stress response functions eqs 10 and 11 were implemented in hydrus 2d 3d šimůnek et al 2016 2008 to simulate either individual or simultaneous effects of water and disease stresses on rwu both static z m r m p z p r z r and dynamic pc min pc max α min or pc 50 p 3 parameters of the rwu function were varied during model calibration to minimize the discrepancy between measured and simulated soil water contents as well as plant transpiration fluxes 2 5 model calibration and performance evaluation the proposed model was calibrated for different water pre and post irrigation and disease limiting conditions t1 to t4 using the spatial distribution of water contents and whole plant transpiration fluxes a global sensitivity analysis was performed using the sobol s method sobol 2001 to reveal critical parameters of each function and to determine the contribution of the uncertainty of each parameter to the uncertainty of the model output the first order s i and total order sensitivity s ti indices were approximated by a numerical monte carlo estimation proposed by saltelli et al 2010 the static root distribution parameters and the stage specific disease stress function parameters were transformed into their defined parameter intervals based on the specified minimum and maximum values parameter limits on the rooting depth and radial distance were observed from the ert profiles whereas the other root distribution parameters were taken from the literature a total of 1000 parameter sets were considered to develop the first order and total order sensitivity indices optimization was performed using a genetic algorithm ga to reveal the optimal set of the most sensitive parameters vrugt et al 2001b gas were developed based on the evolution theory inspired by natural selection and genetics and aimed to solve complex optimization problems the root distribution and disease stress response function parameters were optimized by calibrating the model against soil water contents and plant transpiration fluxes respectively since the inverse module of hydrus 2d 3d is not set to optimize these parameters the ga toolbox in matlab was coupled with the forward computational module of hydrus 2d 3d to perform the calibration the ga was run with 1000 initial parameter sets a penalty factor of 10 a population size of 1000 a crossover fraction of 0 5 and a mutation rate of 0 05 during optimization two point cross over and uniform mutation functions were used with the ga solver goldberg and holland 1988 eight markov chain runs with a set of 1000 generations were utilized to minimize the errors in hydrus 2d 3d simulated water contents model performance was evaluated using the statistical indices that include the root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r 2 cai et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of soil moisture profiles from ert spatiotemporal patterns of the soil water content surrounding the citrus tree were obtained by performing 3d ert experiments before and after each irrigation application during each watering citrus trees were flood irrigated to a depth of about 35 40 mm to replicate the field practices six irrigation applications were considered during the monitoring period table 2 and a typical ert generated soil moisture profile is presented in fig 3 before the interpretation of the results ert data quality and noise reduction were ensured using reciprocal errors and stacking sreeparvathy et al 2019 calibrated time domain reflectometry tdr probes placed at four depths 15 30 45 and 60 cm below the ground level were used to correlate with ert measurements ert derived soil moisture data was in agreement with tdr observations r2 0 65 rmse 0 03 cm3 cm 3 error range 0 04 to 0 08 n 21 and hence were considered as observed soil water contents for use with hydrus 2d 3d calibration it can be observed that irrespective of the health condition soil moisture profiles are visibly distinct between pre and post irrigation scenarios since no lithological anomalies were reported these changes in soil water contents can be attributed to the root zone activity cassiani et al 2015 peddinti et al 2018 before irrigation water stress conditions the soil moisture front that separates the active root zone from the bottom soil layers is clearly visible from the ert profiles fig 3 the depth of the soil moisture front was decreasing from 47 cm for a healthy matured tree t1 to 35 cm for a severely diseased citrus tree t4 as the disease intensity progresses from t1 to t4 the root zone is observed to be attenuating in radial and depth directions for the same applied irrigation water and evaporation losses relatively high soil water contents under a diseased tree following irrigation no water stress condition were observed due to less rwu low photosynthetic activity of diseased trees due to a reduction in lai and chlorophyll contents could be an additional cause even though healthy and unhealthy trees have recorded similar temporal moisture patterns their values differed significantly ert results led to the conclusion that ignoring the health condition of a tree in the numerical model can result in high rwu from diseased trees due to the absence of the water stress which is in contrary to the field measurements 3 2 numerical simulations with hydrus 2d 3d an axisymmetric form of the richards equation for water flow under unsaturated conditions around the citrus tree with rwu represented by an external sink term was numerically solved the finite element mesh along with the applicable boundary conditions is shown in fig 4 the generated mesh with a mesh refinement around the root zone consisted of 8884 nodes 346 1d elements and 17 420 2d elements the model refinement is chosen to achieve a tradeoff between computational cost and numerical convergence the flow domain has a length of 250 cm in the radial direction and 100 cm in the depth direction the upper boundary of the flow domain represents the land surface subjected to atmospheric and irrigation fluxes and was assigned an atmospheric boundary condition since the groundwater table depth 4 6 m is well below the root zone the bottom boundary was assigned a free drainage boundary condition to allow gravitational drainage fluxes following irrigation which were estimated using darcy s equation all remaining boundaries were assumed to represent no flow conditions the upper boundary conditions were assigned using a daily time step for 110 days 09 sep to 27 dec 2017 daily meteorological data was obtained from an automatic weather station aws located at about 30 m from the experimental site the reference evapotranspiration et 0 was estimated using the fao based penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and is in the range of 2 to 8 mm day et 0 was further partitioned into evaporative e 0 and transpiration t 0 demands using the methodology proposed by ritchie 1972 and is validated using flux partitioning methodology peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 rwu is considered as a system dependent boundary condition and is adjusted during the simulation depending on the state variables water and disease stresses rwu is equal to potential transpiration from a healthy irrigated plant and is limited by the lack of soil moisture and or plant health conditions two disease stress response functions linear and non linear models were incorporated into the hydrus 2d 3d code using time varying stage specific pc values since hydrus 2d 3d does not have a dedicated calibration tool for root distribution and disease sensing parameters it was coupled with the ga tool in matlab to perform calibration and parameter estimation the variance based sensitivity analysis using sobol s algorithm was performed to reveal the contribution of individual parameters and their interactions on simulated soil water and transpiration fluxes the detailed results of the sensitivity analysis are available as supplementary material model parameterization and optimization were performed by considering model sensitive parameters root distribution parameters that are sensitive to soil water simulations and their optimal values for each experimental tree are given in table 3 it can be observed that the parameters defining the shape of the spatial root distribution pz and pr are insensitive to model simulations as discussed below in section 3 5 the β r z function for different experimental trees is governed exclusively by scale parameters in the depth and radial directions the ert domain was discretized in such a way that the grid cells of ert and hydrus 2d 3d coincide as much as possible to minimize the interpolation errors model calibration was achieved by matching i simulated soil water contents with ert measurements and ii simulated whole plant transpiration fluxes with sap flow measurements a good agreement between simulated and observed soil water contents was achieved during water limiting pre irrigation and water available post irrigation conditions fig 5 overall hydrus 2d 3d was able to capture the soil moisture profiles for t1 r 2 0 71 rmse 0 032 n 230 t2 r 2 0 74 rmse 0 026 n 230 t3 r 2 0 69 rmse 0 039 n 230 and t4 r 2 0

shaped nonlinear disease stress response functions fig 2 for use with hydrus 2d 3d simulations however the pc of disease causing bacteria was observed to change dynamically during the crop cycle and was controlled by soil water contents and crop phenology fig 2 hence we divided the crop cycle into three stages flowering doy90 135 growth doy136 287 and harvest doy288 365 to define the stage specific functional parameters daily plots of rwu from the experimental plots using the two models are presented in fig 6 both models produced similar rwu patterns during the simulations with marginally different magnitudes during the simulation daily rwu was in the range of 0 05 to 0 46 cm d using a linear stress function and 0 01 to 0 34 cm d using a nonlinear stress function lumped over all experimental trees the linear stress response function yielded slightly higher rwu 0 20 0 08 cm d in comparison to the non linear model 0 16 0 06 cm d cumulative rwu from the four experimental trees t1 through t4 using a linear stress response function were found to be 28 07 25 48 20 84 and 13 54 cm respectively and their counterparts using a nonlinear stress response function were found to be 20 34 19 91 17 75 and 11 54 cm respectively rwu from the linear stress response function was in close agreement with observed transpiration fluxes in comparison to the non linear model daily rwu fluxes simulated using a linear stress response function from a healthy citrus tree t1 for growth and harvest stages were 0 29 0 06 cm d and 0 18 0 03 cm d respectively and the corresponding values from a severely diseased citrus tree t4 were 0 146 0 04 cm d and 0 08 0 01 cm d respectively similarly daily rwu fluxes simulated using a non linear stress response function from a healthy citrus trees t1 for the growth and harvest stages were 0 21 0 04 cm and 0 12 0 01 cm d respectively and the corresponding values from a severely diseased citrus tree t4 were 0 13 0 03 cm d and 0 07 0 01 cm d respectively temporal patterns of rwu averaged over each crop stage can be approximated by a unimodal distribution with low rwu during the flowering stage highest during the growth stage followed by a decreasing trend towards the harvest interestingly this pattern coincides with the pc fig 2 and irrigation frequency this indicates that plant transpiration is sensitive to the pc and applied irrigation water with varying strengths hence the application of irrigation water to disease affected trees during the crop growth stage is more crucial for the effective management of citrus trees parameters of the disease stress response function were optimized for each crop growth stage using linear and nonlinear functions and are presented in table 4 it can be observed that differences between optimized parameters are relatively small between different experimental plots for a given growth stage and relatively large between different growth stages this indicates that it is important to consider time variable disease sensing parameters such as pc 50 p 3 pc max pc min α min to effectively simulate rwu from diseased trees scatter plots of actual transpiration rwu simulated using the two disease stress reduction models along with observed whole plant transpiration fluxes are shown in fig 7 results showed that the rwu fluxes simulated using the piece wise linear stress response function are clustered around the 1 1 line for all scenarios t2 through t4 even though there is some scatter and bias in the estimates it can be observed that the magnitude of underestimation of rwu fluxes deviations from the 1 1 line when the non linear stress response function is used diminishes towards severely disease affected trees t4 this indicates that for severely diseased trees both linear and non linear stress functions give similar predictions close to observed rwu fluxes in other words the bias in estimated daily rwu fluxes is high for a slightly diseased tree t2 and gradually diminishes as the disease severity progresses we attribute this change to variations in model parameters 3 4 propagation of the error in simulated rwu due to ignorance of disease stress to quantify the error and its magnitude in the estimated rwu fluxes from unhealthy trees as a function of disease intensity hydrus 2d 3d simulations were repeated without considering the disease stress response function a healthy citrus tree t1 for which the disease stress function is not applicable had slightly higher simulated transpiration fluxes fig 8 in reality the ubiquitous influence of low pc from healthy trees might inhibit rwu resulting in low observed transpiration to match with hydrus 2d 3d adjusts its root distribution parameters yet achieving significantly deviated rwu fluxes a similar yet significant deviation was observed for other disease affected trees t2 through t4 indicating that consideration of a compensationmechanism to lower simulated rwu is essential the error in simulated rwu from unhealthy trees when ignoring the α pc component i e the difference in box plots of without disease stress and observed transpiration was found to be in the range of 15 to 26 fig 8 it can be observed that for diseased trees of varying intensities t2 through t4 actual transpiration simulated by considering the disease stress response function matched almost perfectly with the observed values having the same range and median values 3 5 spatial distribution of rwu from citrus trees the spatial representation of root water uptake β r z from the experimental trees is illustrated in fig 9 it can be observed that the zone of maximum rwu is located in a thin soil layer that varies from 0 2 m for t4 to about 0 32 m for t1 this zone can be designated as an external sink region that drives soil water flow towards active roots a healthy citrus tree t1 has a larger rooting depth and radius compared to the other three diseased trees it can be observed that the shape of the root distribution function remains the same for all experimental trees this indicates that the health condition of a tree has a significant impact on the scale parameters of the root distribution function the close spacing of contours for a diseased tree indicates that pathogens are inhibiting the water uptake mechanism thereby minimizing the spatial extent of rwu we also conclude that measured plant transpiration fluxes are more useful than measured water content for calibration of soil water plant models from diseased trees 3 6 limitations of research the proposed disease stress functions are applicable to citrus orchards family with similar agro climatic conditions and hence cannot be generalized to other plants we assumed that the two stress functions are independent of each other when evaluating their combined effect on rwu simulations which may not be accurate in reality we could not compare the simulated transpiration fluxes with observations during the flowering stage due to the absence of sap flow measurements the proposed idea can be taken further to develop similar disease stress response functions applicable to different crops of various agro climatic conditions 4 summary and conclusions this research provides an insight into soil water disease interactions of citrus trees using combined experimental and numerical studies field experiments were conducted at four citrus trees of varying health conditions located in the vidarbha region of india to monitor hydrological and root water uptake fluxes in response to irrigation soil water contents and rwu within the rhizosphere were monitored using 3d ert measurements and sap flow meters respectively ert results revealed that a diseased tree consumes less water resulting in higher soil water contents in the root zone a condition favorable to further growth of the fungus an axisymmetric form of the richards equation with the root distribution function proposed by vrugt et al 2001a was then numerically solved using hydrus 2d 3d the reduction in rwu due to the disease stress was modeled using piece wise linear and s shaped non linear functions and their applicability to simulate rwu was evaluated in the presence of the water stress parameters of the disease stress response function were specified by defining thresholds of pc of bacterial pathogens for each crop growth stage optimal root distribution and disease stress function parameters for each scenario were obtained using a genetic algorithm errors in simulating rwu from un healthy tress by ignoring the disease stress condition was observed to be in the range of 15 26 our results indicate that model calibration using plant transpiration data can accurately quantify rwu fluxes from diseased trees declaration of

dams there are over 59 000 dams globally that support irrigation hydropower water supply and flood control world register of dams 2018 dams however block the transportation of sediment and create

huang et al 2019 multi purpose reservoir operation problem can be defined as a complex interrelated system problem that covers both socio economic and eco environmental subsystems with conflicting targets existing among them chang et al 2010 yin et al 2014 for example flushing is a widely used sediment management method that releases stored water to flush reservoir sediment lai and shen 1996 atkinson 1996 shen 1999 white 2001 haun and olsen 2012 however the flushing operation affects slope stability as reservoir water level fluctuation is one of the main factors driving river bank erosion which then may eventually lead to landslide disaster fujita 1977 jia et al 2009 johansson and edeskär 2014 hui 2015 when landslide fails the land mass enters the reservoir and in turn adds to the total amount of reservoir sediment to date however research that takes into account the interactions and feedbacks among sediment flushing and reservoir induced landslides is still missing in an

2020 this paper presents the development of a system dynamics simulation approach sdsa for the analyses of interactions between reservoir s various functions including those for human purposes such as hydropower generation and those for environmental protection such as fish habitats sediment flushing and landslide stability the novelty of this paper lies in i the development of a reservoir system dynamics simulation model that can provide deeper insights into relationships between various reservoir purposes and ii the explicit consideration of the process of landslide failure and its interactions with sediment flushing the proposed sdsa is then applied to the world s largest hydro project three gorges reservoir in china the results from this study can contribute to the environmentally friendly operation of a reservoir system the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the methodology of sdsa for reservoir modelling section 3 focusses on the three gorges reservoir case study and it is followed by the model validation and sensitivity analysis in section 4 the paper ends with the conclusions and discussion in section 5 2 methodology in this section a generic system dynamics simulation approach sdsa is developed to a high level of detail including power production fish habitat sediment flushing and landslide stability sectors that will allow investigators to assess the impacts of placing different operating priorities on the reservoir system s performance the development of sdsa involves i development of causal diagram of a reservoir system that is used to map out and analyze qualitatively all the feedbacks and the main interactions among reservoir system s components and ii development of the simulation model using object oriented approach and the stock and flow diagram the developed sdsa is a generic framework that can be used for any reservoir system 2 1 causal diagram of a reservoir system in the context of sd simulation causal diagrams including combinations of positive and negative causal relationships are far more important for understanding system behavior than the separate details of system structure causal relationships form feedback loops that can be either positive or negative positive feedback loop accelerates change within the system and eventually results in rapid growth or decline negative feedback loop counteracts change and displays goal seeking behavior causal diagrams show how the system variables are interconnected to form the feedback loops and how the feedback loops are interconnected to describe the system structure forester 1971 sterman et al 2000 simonovic 2009 a schematic diagram shown in fig 1 is used to simplify the following description of reservoir system in the remaining of the text the variables used in the model will be in italics their definitions mathematical formulation and units are provided in appendix a in the figure total reservoir volume consists of water volume and total sediment volume total sediment volume consists of river sediment transported from upstream as well as landslide deposit when a reservoir induced landslide fails fish release and flood release represent the water that is released through the spillway and sluices with the former used only for improving downstream fish habitats when applicable and the latter is just the literally meaning i e used for discharging floods power release is the water discharged through the power plant usually the amount of sediment flushed as part of the power and flood releases is negligible during the non flood seasons so this study assumes that sediment can only be flushed away through the scouring sluices sediment release is thus a mixture of sediment and water released through the scouring sluices fig 2 shows the main causal diagram of a reservoir system with feedbacks as closed loop structures that connect the individual variables 2 1 1 loop a in this feedback loop the system behavior of power release is illustrated an increase in power release increases the amount of total release which then decreases the total reservoir volume and the starting reservoir volume correspondingly a decrease in starting reservoir volume decreases the value of expected power production a decrease in expected power production requires smaller amount of power release and thus forms a negative feedback 2 1 2 loop b the structure of this feedback loop is very simple it analyzes the system behavior for fish release an increase in fish release increases the total release and an increase in total release decreases the flow deficit which is defined as the difference between total release and ideal fish flow a decrease in flow deficit results in lower fish release and thus forms a negative feedback loop 2 1 3 loop c in this feedback loop the performance of sediment flushing over time is analyzed an increase in sediment release leads to an increase in total release from the reservoir followed with an increase in reservoir water level drop rate an increase in reservoir water level drop rate enhances the sediment flushing rate and thus increases the amount of sediment flushed away from the reservoir which leads to a decrease in river sediment in the reservoir and accordingly a decrease in total reservoir volume a decrease in total reservoir volume decreases the value of starting reservoir volume which eventually results in a decrease in sediment release and thus generates a negative feedback loop 2 1 4 loop d in this feedback loop the stability of landslide over time is illustrated an increase in total release from the reservoir which may be caused by either an increase in power release or sediment release or flood release or spill leads to an increase in reservoir water level drop rate an increase in reservoir water level drop rate decreases the landslide safety factor thus increasing the risk of landslide failure and the volume of landslide deposit an increase in landslide deposit leads to increases in total sediment volume and total reservoir volume an increase in total reservoir volume increases the value of starting reservoir volume which leads to an increase in total release through either power release or sediment release or flood release or spill this eventually produces a positive feedback and is a very unwelcome consequence during reservoir operation the above presented causal feedback loops capture a reservoir system s behavior qualitatively loops a b and c show negative system behavior indicating that the releases for power production for fish habitats and for sediment flushing display goal seeking behavior loop d illustrates the impacts of total release on the stability of landslide over time and forms a positive feedback loop which means that an increase in total release accelerates the risks of landslide failure within each loop and eventually results in rapid deterioration of landslide stability from loops c and d we can analyze expected interactions between sediment flushing and landslide stability when the impact of total release on sediment flushing outperforms its impact on the stability of landslide the total sediment volume decreases however the total sediment volume will increase if the impact of sediment flushing exceeds the impact of landslide stability 2 2 stock and flow diagram of a reservoir system stocks and flows are the basic building blocks of the system structure a stock represents the accumulation of a quantity state variable while a flow represents the accumulation rate the main stock variables in a reservoir system include the water volume and river sediment in a reservoir the amount of energy generated and the landslide safety factor stock can exist only together with flows in this case the corresponding flow variables are the inflow into and power release flood release sediment release and spill out from the reservoir the sedimentation rate and sediment flushing rate the power production and the decreasing rate of landslide safety factor in this section simulation tool vensim vensim 2014 is used to develop the sdsa model of a reservoir system 2 2 1 reservoir operation sector stock and flow diagram of a reservoir operation sector that was developed in vensim is shown in fig 3 the states of water volume and river sediment are subject to the reservoir operating rules i e the release decisions they include flood release fish release power release and sediment release and can be introduced in the simulation model by using a set of if then else statements see fig 9 and table a1 in appendix a for full details of the specific functions of reservoir operation 2 2 2 reservoir power production sector the stock and flow diagram of the power production sector is shown in fig 4 table a1 in appendix a presents the calculations of power production and energy 2 2 3 reservoir fish sector the schematic diagram that describes the impacts of reservoir operation on downstream fish habitats is shown in fig 5 the flow deficit is defined as the difference between total release and ideal fish flow where ideal fish flow is the ideal flow condition for fish spawning the constants implicit time and factor are employed to ensure convergence while solving the simultaneous equation involving in fish release 2 2 4 reservoir sediment sector flushing can be very effective for removing accumulated sediment from the reservoir a lot of factors influence flushing efficiency like reservoir topography sediment characteristics discharge volume flow velocity and reservoir water level drop rate and duration of flushing in this research only the factor of reservoir water level drop rate is considered the stock and flow diagram that simulates the impacts of reservoir operation on sediment flushing is shown in fig 6 the key of this sector is to quantify the relationship between reservoir water level drop rate and sediment flushing rate 1 s f rate f dwl in which dwl represents the reservoir water level drop rate defined as the difference between ending reservoir water level and starting reservoir water level sfrate is sediment flushing rate 2 2 5 reservoir landslide sector the influence of water level fluctuations on reservoir slope stability has been widely studied reservoir induced landslide can occur as a result of reservoir filling or drawdown schuster 1979 most of the time landsides occur during rapid drawdown periods fujita 1977 jia et al 2009 wang et al 2015a b in this study the impacts of reservoir water level drop rate on slope stability is explored the stock and flow diagram that describes the impact of reservoir operation on landslide stability is shown in fig 7 in this sector the landslide safety factor which is a dimensionless parameter widely used to describe landslide stability is treated as a stock variable its corresponding flow variable is decreasing rate which is measured per unit of time to quantify the impact of reservoir water level drop rate on landslide safety factor an auxiliary variable landslide safety factor multiplier is introduced the landslide safety factor multiplier is assumed to be a function of reservoir water level drop rate 2 multiplier f dwl where multiplier represents the landslide safety factor multiplier landslide failure occurs when landslide safety factor drops below the value of 1 0 landslide deposit is the amount of landslide body that slides directly into the reservoir the total sediment volume is thus the sum of the landslide deposit and the river sediment landslide caused life loss and economic loss can be computed based on the frequency and severity of landslide failure as 3 l life n 1 n b 1 n l i f e 1 n b 2 n l i f e 2 n b 3 n l i f e 3 n l economic n 1 n a 1 n e c o n 1 n a 2 n e c o n 2 n a 3 n e c o n 3 n in which n is the number of failed landslides life 1 life 2 and life 3 are the three different severity levels of life loss caused by landslide failure people b 1 b 2 and b 3 are the corresponding weight coefficients of landslide induced loss of life econ 1 econ 2 and econ 3 are the three different severity levels of economic loss caused by landslide failure 108 rmb a 1 a 2 and a 3 are the corresponding weight coefficients of landslide economic loss 3 a case study to test the utility of the proposed sdsa modeling framework the three gorges reservoir tgr on the yangtze river china is used as an illustrative case study 3 1 system description the three gorges dam tgd made of concrete and steel is about 2 3 kilometers long and 185 m high the construction of the project took over 17 years to complete when the reservoir is filled to its normal water level 175 m abs a nearly 600 kilometre long reservoir with a total storage of 393 108 m3 has been created of which 221 5 108 m3 is used for flood control besides its main purpose as flood control the huge reservoir created by the tgd also serves for hydropower generation and navigation the three gorges plant is the world s largest hydropower station in terms of installed capacity 22 500 mw an estimated 100 twh electricity is being generated and transmitted to china s mega cities including shanghai and guangdong by deepening the channel and slowing down the flow tgr also improves the navigability and increases the trade capacity of the river the yangtze river is one of the largest transportation routes within china however besides its huge economic and social benefits the tgr also has some negative impacts on local environment which include but not limited to the reservoir operation caused landslides sedimentation alteration of downstream natural flow regime and disruption of downstream aquatic system to name a few 3 2 input data and operation scenarios according to the operation scheduling procedure september 11 is the date that tgr reservoir starts to fill up from 145 m to 175 m whereas june 10 is the date that reservoir water level should drop down to 145 m to allow for incoming floods in this study the reservoir operation is simulated for the period from september 11 to june 10 with a daily time step the historical daily inflow series for the period 1991 2000 shown in fig 8 are used as the input data series four operation scenarios are developed to test the impacts of placing different economic and environmental priorities on the reservoir system performance the main characteristics of reservoir operation under each of the four operation scenarios are summarized in table 1 the s power scenario is used as a baseline the s fish s sediment and s landslide scenarios investigate the effects of creating ideal fish flow for sturgeon spawning prioritizing reservoir sediment release and controlling reservoir water level drop rate in the tgr system respectively the operation of reservoir follows the following steps i calculate sediment release sediment release is activated only when s sediment is in operation otherwise it equals to zero ii calculate power release details of power release rules are illustrated in fig 9 iii calculate fish release fish release is activated only when s fish scenario is in operation otherwise it equals to zero iv calculate flood release and v calculate potential spill 3 3 quantification of the empirical relationships according to the description in the stock and flow diagram of a reservoir system section two sets of empirical functions eqs 1 and 2 need to be quantified for eq 1 the empirical relationship between sediment flushing rate and reservoir water level drop rate shown in fig 10 a is derived based on the sediment flushing experiments conducted in 2012 and 2013 zhou et al 2015a b c for eq 2 the empirical relationship between landslide safety factor multiplier and reservoir water level drop rate shown in fig 10 b is derived based on previous published research by headquarters of the prevention and control of geo disaster within tgr 2004 and wang et al 2015a b 3 4 simulation results in this case study eighteen typical large scale landslides are taken into consideration model parameters and their corresponding values are provided in appendix a table a1 the proposed four operation scenarios are used to assess the impacts of placing different economic and environmental priorities on the performance of reservoir system in terms of energy total sediment volume river sediment landslide deposit flow deficit and landslide induced loss of life and economic loss the behavior of reservoir water level under different operation scenarios is shown in fig 11 the simulation results from the period 1991 2000 under each operation scenario are averaged and shown in table 2 and fig 12 the simulation results in table 2 and fig 12 do clearly present the trade offs between different reservoir purposes enumeration of various trade offs using the proposed sdsa can serve the reservoir operators in i modifying the reservoir operations ii assessing the impacts of different operations strategies and iii easily adopting the model structure and simulation scenarios to changing conditions for example climate change land use change etc the following discussion of trade offs for the three gorges illustrative case study follows the dynamic behavior of energy production under four operation scenarios is shown in table 2 and fig 12a as can be seen a significant energy difference exists between the s fish scenario and the other three scenarios during the sturgeon spawning season an extra amount of water i e fish release is released to meet the flow demand for sturgeon spawning as was illustrated in section causal diagram of a reservoir system fish release represents the water that is released through the spillway and sluices not through the power plant so this amount of water can not be used to generate electricity in addition ensuring the ideal fish flow for the sturgeon results in the failure of filling up the reservoir up to 175 m in most of the years see fig 11b the inability to fill up the reservoir to its full storage capacity further reduces the production of energy by the end of simulation the average production of energy is only 41 85 billion kwh a 3 59 billion of energy was lost when compared to the s power scenario allowing for sediment flushing under s sediment scenario results in a decrease of 0 27 billion of energy production when compared to the base run however in comparison to the base run a slight increase of 0 01 billion in energy production is found under s landslide scenario indicating that the controlling of reservoir water level drop rate actually is in favor of energy production results from table 2 and fig 12b show that the total flow deficit for sturgeon spawning under the s fish scenario is zero while the flow deficits under the other three operation scenarios are about 88 thousand m3 s indicating that s fish scenario improves significantly the flow conditions for sturgeon spawning however at the cost of large energy loss as was illustrated in the previous paragraph fig 12c and d show the dynamic behavior of river sediment and landslide deposit because a constant river sedimentation rate is assumed the curves of river sediment under s power s fish and s landslide scenarios rise up linearly during the simulation period for s sediment scenario the river sediment drops down when sediment flushing is activated the landslide deposit under s landslide scenario remains zero during the whole simulation the results of landslide deposit under s power s fish and s sediment scenarios show two major jumps at the beginning and the end of simulation because of reservoir induced landslide failure the total amount of landslide deposit under s sediment scenario is 62 06 million m3 a value that is higher than those of the other two scenarios the total sediment volume shown in fig 12e is the sum of river sediment and landslide deposit one major finding about the behavior of total sediment volume is that the intention of sediment flushing s sediment scenario actually generates more sediment in the reservoir as the cumulative total sediment volume under this scenario is 111 14 million m3 which is slightly bigger than the s power scenario 111 05 million m3 the reason of which is the initiation of sediment release which adds to the total release increases the reservoir water level drop rate which not only enhances the ability of sediment flushing but also increases the risk of landslide failure obviously the effect of reservoir water level drop rate on landslide failure dominates the effect on sediment flushing in this case as the s landslide scenario ensures the stability of landslides the total sediment volume keeps rising linearly during the simulation reaching a total value of 53 43 million m3 at the end of simulation results from table 2 and fig 12f show that the loss of life and economic loss rise up sharply under s power s fish and s sediment scenarios especially during the reservoir drawdown period the s sediment scenario leads to the greatest life and economic losses among the three scenarios with a total of 160 lives and 0 64 108 rmb losses caused by landslide failure at the end of simulation s power and s fish scenarios both result in a total loss of 150 lives and 0 6 108 rmb for the s landslide scenario there is no landslide induced losses of life nor the economic losses however ensuring a maximum allowable water level drop rate to guarantee landslide stability can pose potential risk to the reservoir system this can be confirmed by the results shown in fig 11d as can be seen the reservoir water level may unable to drop down to 145 m to allow for incoming floods during high flow years like for example 1991 by the end of simulation the reservoir water level is 153 m 4 model validation and sensitivity analysis in the context of system dynamics model validation is more like a semi formal process consisting of both quantitative and qualitative evaluations barlas 1996 and has not always been discussed in detail like those purely data driven black box models yu and schwartz 1999 sterman et al 2000 in system dynamics modeling validation is focused on system structure and can be done throughout the application of modeling steps starting with problem definition causal diagram development and continuing with the stock and flow diagram construction barlas 1996 in this research the major effort went into ensuring the quality of the model in model conceptualization and formulation phases see methodology section to further validate the model or to quantitatively evaluate the model performance we used sensitivity analysis to determine how are the target variables affected by changes in input parameters the largest uncertainty is observed for initial water volume and fraction factor variables the value of initial water volume is varied from s wl140 to s wl145 and s wl150 the 1998 inflow series is used as input data the impacts of initialization on reservoir system behavior is shown in fig 13 it is observed that the behavior of energy total sediment volume flow deficit and landslide induced life loss basically has the same shape when the initial reservoir water levels are 140 m 145 m and 150 m respectively the sensitivity of model behavior to the parameter fraction factor is also evaluated by changing its value from 0 1 to 1 0 with an increment of 0 1 the 1998 inflow series is used as input data results shown in fig 14 indicate that the variable that is sensitive to fraction factor is the total sediment volume this is because the volume of landslide considered in this research is negligible when compared to the large reservoir storage capacity therefore its impacts on energy and flow deficit is hardly noticeable the qualitative and quantitative model validation results suggest that the developed sdsa model is capable of simulating interactions between different system components and the case study application of the developed model is able to capture the main behavioral dynamics of the reservoir system 5 conclusions and discussion as the appeal for lowering environmental impacts of reservoir is growing louder the implementation of environmentally friendly operating rules is becoming increasingly important a systems view of the interactions between hydropower production and environmental impacts is a prerequisite to attain the full benefits of reservoir operation in this research a generic sdsa model that explicitly takes into account the feedbacks and interrelationships among reservoir system s various functions is proposed the approach has been applied to the tgr in china as an illustrative case study the dynamic behavior of the tgr under the proposed four operation scenarios with different priorities focusing on economic and environmental impacts respectively are investigated the sdsa simulation results offer the better understanding of trade offs between the considered reservoir functions in s power scenario five power production transition zones 6 300 mw 8 400 mw 10 500 mw 12 600 mw and 14 700 mw are set to generate as much electricity as possible during the reservoir filling up and draining down periods the potential abrupt change in power release together with the fluctuation of inflow series see fig 8 can lead to a sudden drop of reservoir water level which may eventually trigger landslide failure and result in landslide induced life and economic losses see fig 12d and 12f in s fish scenario the release of an extra amount of water to meet the sturgeon spawning flow improves substantially the flow conditions for sturgeon spawning however at a very high cost of reduction in electricity generation because the reservoir can not fill up to its designed normal water level of 175 m in five out of ten simulation years 1991 1992 1996 1997 1998 see fig 11b in s sediment scenario the initiation of sediment release does evacuate river sediment but the total sediment volume is however slightly higher than in the s power scenario as the effect of reservoir water level drop rate on landslide failure dominates the effect on sediment flushing in s landslide scenario ensuring a maximum allowable water level drop rate to guarantee landslide stability results in a significant decrease in total sediment volume and no landslide induced life and economic losses at all however ensuring landslide stability during reservoir operation can pose potential risk to the reservoir system as the reservoir water level may fail to drop to 145 m to allow for incoming floods during high flow years like the year of 1991 fig 11d it is important to keep in mind that the proposed operation scenarios are only for illustrative use and do not indicate actual operation policies of the china three gorges corporation it is also important to note that reservoir operation is a very complex decision making process because of its multiple and usually conflicting targets any advice on how to design dispatching rules can not be possible without conducting a thorough investigation of varying inflow conditions potential conflicting targets and various operation scenarios it is our expectation that the proposed sdsa methodology can be effectively used in the process of deriving reservoir friendly operation however derivation of reservoir dispatching rules is beyond the scope of this research based on the results obtained from the illustrative case study the following future research tasks can be attempted in investigating the friendly operation of the tgr 1 how to generate as much electricity and avoid abrupt drop of reservoir water level during the reservoir fill up and drawdown periods 2 how to balance the needs of reservoir fill up and releasing of fish flow during the sturgeon spawning season 3 more experiments should be conducted to reveal the mechanisms of the reservoir water level fluctuation on sediment flushing and landslide stability and 4 explore the trade offs between ensuring a maximum allowable water level drop rate and the potential risk of the failure of reservoir water level dropping down to 145 m during the reservoir drawdown period 6 data availability statement all data models or code generated or used during the study are available from

5431,multipurpose reservoir operation is a very complex decision making process because of its multiple and usually conflicting targets a system view of the interactions between various reservoir purposes like for example hydropower production and environmental impacts such as fish habitats sediment flushing and landslide stability is a prerequisite to attain the full benefits from reservoir operations system dynamics simulation is a well suited approach for dealing with complex time varying systems and is widely used in water resources management and analyses of global change this paper presents the development of a generic system dynamics simulation approach sdsa for the analyses of interactions between reservoir s various functions the implementation of sdsa includes two steps first the causal diagram of the reservoir system is used to map and analyze the main interactions among reservoir system s different components identify driving feedback relationships and use the system structure to obtain insights into system behavior in the second step the stock and flow diagraming is used to quantify those feedbacks and interactions by introducing a set of physical and empirical relationships required to simulate the model the developed sdsa is applied to the three gorges reservoir in china scenario based simulation analyses are performed with the sdsa model to increase the understanding of placing different priorities on the interactions between hydropower production and environmental impacts of reservoir operations results from model validation and sensitivity analyses suggest that the developed sdsa model is capable of simulating interactions among reservoir s various functions and the case study application demonstrates the utility of the model for capturing the main characteristics of reservoir system dynamic behavior the insights gained from model simulations can assist in environmentally friendly operations of the reservoir keywords

people and property from floods irrigating farmland providing for municipal and industrial water supply controlling water quality and generating electricity yoo 2009 jiang et al 2015 ehsani et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 world register of dams 2018 turgut et al 2019 therefore a very large number of dams are built under construction or planned globally according to the international commission on large dams there are over 59 000 dams globally that support irrigation hydropower water supply and flood control world register of dams 2018 dams however block the transportation of sediment and create barriers to the movement of nutrients and organisms shields et al 2000 jansson 2002 gong et al 2006 chai et al 2009 morais et al 2009 rollet et al 2009 dai 2013 kondolf et al 2014 for example it is estimated that one and a half per cent of the total storage volume is lost annually to sedimentation white 2001 the operation of reservoir changes the natural aquatic flow regime which in turn changes the aquatic and riparian habitat and thus affects the structure and function of flora and fauna suen et al 2009 li et al 2010 tebakari et al 2012 gao et al 2013 fishes especially the long distance

huang et al 2019 multi purpose reservoir operation problem can be defined as a complex interrelated system problem that covers both socio economic and eco environmental subsystems with conflicting targets existing among them chang et al 2010 yin et al 2014 for example flushing is a widely used sediment management method that releases stored water to flush reservoir sediment lai and shen 1996 atkinson 1996 shen 1999 white 2001 haun and olsen 2012 however the flushing operation affects slope stability as reservoir water level fluctuation is one of the main factors driving river bank erosion which then may eventually lead to landslide disaster fujita 1977 jia et al 2009 johansson and edeskär 2014 hui 2015 when landslide fails the land mass enters the reservoir and in turn adds to the total amount of reservoir sediment to date however research that takes into account the interactions and feedbacks among sediment flushing and reservoir induced landslides is still missing in an effort to account for the complex interrelations and feedbacks in reservoir system researchers have advocated for system thinking while designing operating rules elsawah et al 2017 mirchi et al 2012

2020 this paper presents the development of a system dynamics simulation approach sdsa for the analyses of interactions between reservoir s various functions including those for human purposes such as hydropower generation and those for environmental protection such as fish habitats sediment flushing and landslide stability the novelty of this paper lies in i the development of a reservoir system dynamics simulation model that can provide deeper insights into relationships between various reservoir purposes and ii the explicit consideration of the process of landslide failure and its interactions with sediment flushing the proposed sdsa is then applied to the world s largest hydro project three gorges reservoir in china the results from this study can contribute to the environmentally friendly operation of a reservoir system the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the methodology of sdsa for reservoir modelling section 3 focusses on the three gorges reservoir case study and it is followed by the model validation and sensitivity analysis in section 4 the paper ends with the conclusions and discussion in section 5 2 methodology in this section a generic system dynamics simulation approach sdsa is developed to a high level of detail including power production fish habitat sediment flushing and landslide stability sectors that will allow investigators to assess the impacts of placing different operating priorities on the reservoir system s performance the development of sdsa involves i development of causal diagram of a reservoir system that is used to map out and analyze qualitatively all the feedbacks and the main interactions among reservoir system s components and ii development of the simulation model using object oriented approach and the stock and flow diagram the developed sdsa is a generic framework that can be used for any reservoir system 2 1 causal diagram of a reservoir system in the context of sd simulation causal diagrams including combinations of positive and negative causal relationships are far more important for understanding system behavior than the separate details of system structure causal relationships form feedback loops that can be either positive or negative positive feedback loop accelerates change within the system and eventually results in rapid growth or decline negative feedback loop counteracts change and displays goal seeking behavior causal diagrams show how the system variables are interconnected to form the feedback loops and how the feedback loops are interconnected to describe the system structure forester 1971 sterman et al 2000 simonovic 2009 a schematic diagram shown in fig 1 is used to simplify the following description of reservoir system in the remaining of the text the variables used in the model will be in italics their definitions mathematical formulation and units are provided in appendix a in the figure total reservoir volume consists of water volume and total sediment volume total sediment volume consists of river sediment transported from upstream as well as landslide deposit when a reservoir induced landslide fails fish release and flood release represent the water that is released through the spillway and sluices with the former used only for improving downstream fish habitats when applicable and the latter is just the literally meaning i e used for discharging floods power release is the water discharged through the power plant usually the amount of sediment flushed as part of the power and flood releases is negligible during the non flood seasons so this study assumes that sediment can only be flushed away through the scouring sluices sediment release is thus a mixture of sediment and water released through the scouring sluices fig 2 shows the main causal diagram of a reservoir system with feedbacks as closed loop structures that connect the individual variables 2 1 1 loop a in this feedback loop the system behavior of power release is illustrated an increase in power release increases the amount of total release which then decreases the total reservoir volume and the starting reservoir volume correspondingly a decrease in starting reservoir volume decreases the value of expected power production a decrease in expected power production requires smaller amount of power release and thus forms a negative feedback 2 1 2 loop b the structure of this feedback loop is very simple it analyzes the system behavior for fish release an increase in fish release increases the total release and an increase in total release decreases the flow deficit which is defined as the difference between total release and ideal fish flow a decrease in flow deficit results in lower fish release and thus forms a negative feedback loop 2 1 3 loop c in this feedback loop the performance of sediment flushing over time is analyzed an increase in sediment release leads to an increase in total release from the reservoir followed with an increase in reservoir water level drop rate an increase in reservoir water level drop rate enhances the sediment flushing rate and thus increases the amount of sediment flushed away from the reservoir which leads to a decrease in river sediment in the reservoir and accordingly a decrease in total reservoir volume a decrease in total reservoir volume decreases the value of starting reservoir volume which eventually results in a decrease in sediment release and thus generates a negative feedback loop 2 1 4 loop d in this feedback loop the stability of landslide over time is illustrated an increase in total release from the reservoir which may be caused by either an increase in power release or sediment release or flood release or spill leads to an increase in reservoir water level drop rate an increase in reservoir water level drop rate decreases the landslide safety factor thus increasing the risk of landslide failure and the volume of landslide deposit an increase in landslide deposit leads to increases in total sediment volume and total reservoir volume an increase in total reservoir volume increases the value of starting reservoir volume which leads to an increase in total release through either power release or sediment release or flood release or spill this eventually produces a positive feedback and is a very unwelcome consequence during reservoir operation the above presented causal feedback loops capture a reservoir system s behavior qualitatively loops a b and c show negative system behavior indicating that the releases for power production for fish habitats and for sediment flushing display goal seeking behavior loop d illustrates the impacts of total release on the stability of landslide over time and forms a positive feedback loop which means that an increase in total release accelerates the risks of landslide failure within each loop and eventually results in rapid deterioration of landslide stability from loops c and d we can analyze expected interactions between sediment flushing and landslide stability when the impact of total release on sediment flushing outperforms its impact on the stability of landslide the total sediment volume decreases however the total sediment volume will increase if the impact of sediment flushing exceeds the impact of landslide stability 2 2 stock and flow diagram of a reservoir system stocks and flows are the basic building blocks of the system structure a stock represents the accumulation of a quantity state variable while a flow represents the accumulation rate the main stock variables in a reservoir system include the water volume and river sediment in a reservoir the amount of energy generated and the landslide safety factor stock can exist only together with flows in this case the corresponding flow variables are the inflow into and power release flood release sediment release and spill out from the reservoir the sedimentation rate and sediment flushing rate the power production and the decreasing rate of landslide safety factor in this section simulation tool vensim vensim 2014 is used to develop the sdsa model of a reservoir system 2 2 1 reservoir operation sector stock and flow diagram of a reservoir operation sector that was developed in vensim is shown in fig 3 the states of water volume and river sediment are subject to the reservoir operating rules i e the release decisions they include flood release fish release power release and sediment release and can be introduced in the simulation model by using a set of if then else statements see fig 9 and table a1 in appendix a for full details of the specific functions of reservoir operation 2 2 2 reservoir power production sector the stock and flow diagram of the power production sector is shown in fig 4 table a1 in appendix a presents the calculations of power production and energy 2 2 3 reservoir fish sector the schematic diagram that describes the impacts of reservoir operation on downstream fish habitats is shown in fig 5 the flow deficit is defined as the difference between total release and ideal fish flow where ideal fish flow is the ideal flow condition for fish spawning the constants implicit time and factor are employed to ensure convergence while solving the simultaneous equation involving in fish release 2 2 4 reservoir sediment sector flushing can be very effective for removing accumulated sediment from the reservoir a lot of factors influence flushing efficiency like reservoir topography sediment characteristics discharge volume flow velocity and reservoir water level drop rate and duration of flushing in this research only the factor of reservoir water level drop rate is considered the stock and flow diagram that simulates the impacts of reservoir operation on sediment flushing is shown in fig 6 the key of this sector is to quantify the relationship between reservoir water level drop rate and sediment flushing rate 1 s f rate f dwl in which dwl represents the reservoir water level drop rate defined as the difference between ending reservoir water level and starting reservoir water level sfrate is sediment flushing rate 2 2 5 reservoir landslide sector the influence of water level fluctuations on reservoir slope stability has been widely studied reservoir induced landslide can occur as a result of reservoir filling or drawdown schuster 1979 most of the time landsides occur during rapid drawdown periods fujita 1977 jia et al 2009 wang et al 2015a b in this study the impacts of reservoir water level drop rate on slope stability is explored the stock and flow diagram that describes the impact of reservoir operation on landslide stability is shown in fig 7 in this sector the landslide safety factor which is a dimensionless parameter widely used to describe landslide stability is treated as a stock variable its corresponding flow variable is decreasing rate which is measured per unit of time to quantify the impact of reservoir water level drop rate on landslide safety factor an auxiliary variable landslide safety factor multiplier is introduced the landslide safety factor multiplier is assumed to be a function of reservoir water level drop rate 2 multiplier f dwl where multiplier represents the landslide safety factor multiplier landslide failure occurs when landslide safety factor drops below the value of 1 0 landslide deposit is the amount of landslide body that slides directly into the reservoir the total sediment volume is thus the sum of the landslide deposit and the river sediment landslide caused life loss and economic loss can be computed based on the frequency and severity of landslide failure as 3 l life n 1 n b 1 n l i f e 1 n b 2 n l i f e 2 n b 3 n l i f e 3 n l economic n 1 n a 1 n e c o n 1 n a 2 n e c o n 2 n a 3 n e c o n 3 n in which n is the number of failed landslides life 1 life 2 and life 3 are the three different severity levels of life loss caused by landslide failure people b 1 b 2 and b 3 are the corresponding weight coefficients of landslide induced loss of life econ 1 econ 2 and econ 3 are the three different severity levels of economic loss caused by landslide failure 108 rmb a 1 a 2 and a 3 are the corresponding weight coefficients of landslide economic loss 3 a case study to test the utility of the proposed sdsa modeling framework the three gorges reservoir tgr on the yangtze river china is used as an illustrative case study 3 1 system description the three gorges dam tgd made of concrete and steel is about 2 3 kilometers long and 185 m high the construction of the project took over 17 years to complete when the reservoir is filled to its normal water level 175 m abs a nearly 600 kilometre long reservoir with a total storage of 393 108 m3 has been created of which 221 5 108 m3 is used for flood control besides its main purpose as flood control the huge reservoir created by the tgd also serves for hydropower generation and navigation the three gorges plant is the world s largest hydropower station in terms of installed capacity 22 500 mw an estimated 100 twh electricity is being generated and transmitted to china s mega cities including shanghai and guangdong by deepening the channel and slowing down the flow tgr also improves the navigability and increases the trade capacity of the river the yangtze river is one of the largest transportation routes within china however besides its huge economic and social benefits the tgr also has some negative impacts on local environment which include but not limited to the reservoir operation caused landslides sedimentation alteration of downstream natural flow regime and disruption of downstream aquatic system to name a few 3 2 input data and operation scenarios according to the operation scheduling procedure september 11 is the date that tgr reservoir starts to fill up from 145 m to 175 m whereas june 10 is the date that reservoir water level should drop down to 145 m to allow for incoming floods in this study the reservoir operation is simulated for the period from september 11 to june 10 with a daily time step the historical daily inflow series for the period 1991 2000 shown in fig 8 are used as the input data series four operation scenarios are developed to test the impacts of placing different economic and environmental priorities on the reservoir system performance the main characteristics of reservoir operation under each of the four operation scenarios are summarized in table 1 the s power scenario is used as a baseline the s fish s sediment and s landslide scenarios investigate the effects of creating ideal fish flow for sturgeon spawning prioritizing reservoir sediment release and controlling reservoir water level drop rate in the tgr system respectively the operation of reservoir follows the following steps i calculate sediment release sediment release is activated only when s sediment is in operation otherwise it equals to zero ii calculate power release details of power release rules are illustrated in fig 9 iii calculate fish release fish release is activated only when s fish scenario is in operation otherwise it equals to zero iv calculate flood release and v calculate potential spill 3 3 quantification of the empirical relationships according to the description in the stock and flow diagram of a reservoir system section two sets of empirical functions eqs 1 and 2 need to be quantified for eq 1 the empirical relationship between sediment flushing rate and reservoir water level drop rate shown in fig 10 a is derived based on the sediment flushing experiments conducted in 2012 and 2013 zhou et al 2015a b c for eq 2 the empirical relationship between landslide safety factor multiplier and reservoir water level drop rate shown in fig 10 b is derived based on previous published research by headquarters of the prevention and control of geo disaster within tgr 2004 and wang et al 2015a b 3 4 simulation results in this case study eighteen typical large scale landslides are taken into consideration model parameters and their corresponding values are provided in appendix a table a1 the proposed four operation scenarios are used to assess the impacts of placing different economic and environmental priorities on the performance of reservoir system in terms of energy total sediment volume river sediment landslide deposit flow deficit and landslide induced loss of life and economic loss the behavior of reservoir water level under different operation scenarios is shown in fig 11 the simulation results from the period 1991 2000 under each operation scenario are averaged and shown in table 2 and fig 12 the simulation results in table 2 and fig 12 do clearly present the trade offs between different reservoir purposes enumeration of various trade offs using the proposed sdsa can serve the reservoir operators in i modifying the reservoir operations ii assessing the impacts of different operations strategies and iii easily adopting the model structure and simulation scenarios to changing conditions for example climate change land use change etc the following discussion of trade offs for the three gorges illustrative case study follows the dynamic behavior of energy production under four operation scenarios is shown in table 2 and fig 12a as can be seen a significant energy difference exists between the s fish scenario and the other three scenarios during the sturgeon spawning season an extra amount of water i e fish release is released to meet the flow demand for sturgeon spawning as was illustrated in section causal diagram of a reservoir system fish release represents the water that is released through the spillway and sluices not through the power plant so this amount of water can not be used to generate electricity in addition ensuring the ideal fish flow for the sturgeon results in the failure of filling up the reservoir up to 175 m in most of the years see fig 11b the inability to fill up the reservoir to its full storage capacity further reduces the production of energy by the end of simulation the average production of energy is only 41 85 billion kwh a 3 59 billion of energy was lost when compared to the s power scenario allowing for sediment flushing under s sediment scenario results in a decrease of 0 27 billion of energy production when compared to the base run however in comparison to the base run a slight increase of 0 01 billion in energy production is found under s landslide scenario indicating that the controlling of reservoir water level drop rate actually is in favor of energy production results from table 2 and fig 12b show that the total flow deficit for sturgeon spawning under the s fish scenario is zero while the flow deficits under the other three operation scenarios are about 88 thousand m3 s indicating that s fish scenario improves significantly the flow conditions for sturgeon spawning however at the cost of large energy loss as was illustrated in the previous paragraph fig 12c and d show the dynamic behavior of river sediment and landslide deposit because a constant river sedimentation rate is assumed the curves of river sediment under s power s fish and s landslide scenarios rise up linearly during the simulation period for s sediment scenario the river sediment drops down when sediment flushing is activated the landslide deposit under s landslide scenario remains zero during the whole simulation the results of landslide deposit under s power s fish and s sediment scenarios show two major jumps at the beginning and the end of simulation because of reservoir induced landslide failure the total amount of landslide deposit under s sediment scenario is 62 06 million m3 a value that is higher than those of the other two scenarios the total sediment volume shown in fig 12e is the sum of river sediment and landslide deposit one major finding about the behavior of total sediment volume is that the intention of sediment flushing s sediment scenario actually generates more sediment in the reservoir as the cumulative total sediment volume under this scenario is 111 14 million m3 which is slightly bigger than the s power scenario 111 05 million m3 the reason of which is the initiation of sediment release which adds to the total release increases the reservoir water level drop rate which not only enhances the ability of sediment flushing but also increases the risk of landslide failure obviously the effect of reservoir water level drop rate on landslide failure dominates the effect on sediment flushing in this case as the s landslide scenario ensures the stability of landslides the total sediment volume keeps rising linearly during the simulation reaching a total value of 53 43 million m3 at the end of simulation results from table 2 and fig 12f show that the loss of life and economic loss rise up sharply under s power s fish and s sediment scenarios especially during the reservoir drawdown period the s sediment scenario leads to the greatest life and economic losses among the three scenarios with a total of 160 lives and 0 64 108 rmb losses caused by landslide failure at the end of simulation s power and s fish scenarios both result in a total loss of 150 lives and 0 6 108 rmb for the s landslide scenario there is no landslide induced losses of life nor the economic losses however ensuring a maximum allowable water level drop rate to guarantee landslide stability can pose potential risk to the reservoir system this can be confirmed by the results shown in fig 11d as can be seen the reservoir water level may unable to drop down to 145 m to allow for incoming floods during high flow years like for example 1991 by the end of simulation the reservoir water level is 153 m 4 model validation and sensitivity analysis in the context of system dynamics model validation is more like a semi formal process consisting of both quantitative and qualitative evaluations barlas 1996 and has not always been discussed in detail like those purely data driven black box models yu and schwartz 1999 sterman et al 2000 in system dynamics modeling validation is focused on system structure and can be done throughout the application of modeling steps starting with problem definition causal diagram development and continuing with the stock and flow diagram construction barlas 1996 in this research the major effort went into ensuring the quality of the model in model conceptualization and formulation phases see methodology section to further validate the model or to quantitatively evaluate the model performance we used sensitivity analysis to determine how are the target variables affected by changes in input parameters the largest uncertainty is observed for initial water volume and fraction factor variables the value of initial water volume is varied from s wl140 to s wl145 and s wl150 the 1998 inflow series is used as input data the impacts of initialization on reservoir system behavior is shown in fig 13 it is observed that the behavior of energy total sediment volume flow deficit and landslide induced life loss basically has the same shape when the initial reservoir water levels are 140 m 145 m and 150 m respectively the sensitivity of model behavior to the parameter fraction factor is also evaluated by changing its value from 0 1 to 1 0 with an increment of 0 1 the 1998 inflow series is used as input data results shown in fig 14 indicate that the variable that is sensitive to fraction factor is the total sediment volume this is because the volume of landslide considered in this research is negligible when compared to the large reservoir storage capacity therefore its impacts on energy and flow deficit is hardly noticeable the qualitative and quantitative model validation results suggest that the developed sdsa model is capable of simulating interactions between different system components and the case study application of the developed model is able to capture the main behavioral dynamics of the reservoir system 5 conclusions and discussion as the appeal for lowering environmental impacts of reservoir is growing louder the implementation of environmentally friendly operating rules is becoming increasingly important a systems view of the interactions between hydropower production and environmental impacts is a prerequisite to attain the full benefits of reservoir operation in this research a generic sdsa model that explicitly takes into account the feedbacks and interrelationships among reservoir system s various functions is proposed the approach has been applied to the tgr in china as an illustrative case study the dynamic behavior of the tgr under the proposed four operation scenarios with different priorities focusing on economic and environmental impacts respectively are investigated the sdsa simulation results offer the better understanding of trade offs between the considered reservoir functions in s power scenario five power production transition zones 6 300 mw 8 400 mw 10 500 mw 12 600 mw and 14 700 mw are set to generate as much electricity as possible during the reservoir filling up and draining down periods the potential abrupt change in power release together with the fluctuation of inflow series see fig 8 can lead to a sudden drop of reservoir water level which may eventually trigger landslide failure and result in landslide induced life and economic losses see fig 12d and 12f in s fish scenario the release of an extra amount of water to meet the sturgeon spawning flow improves substantially the flow conditions for sturgeon spawning however at a very high cost of reduction in electricity generation because the reservoir can not fill up to its designed normal water level of 175 m in five out of ten simulation years 1991 1992 1996 1997 1998 see fig 11b in s sediment scenario the initiation of sediment release does evacuate river sediment but the total sediment volume is however slightly higher than in the s power scenario as the effect of reservoir water level drop rate on landslide failure dominates the effect on sediment flushing in s landslide scenario ensuring a maximum allowable water level drop rate to guarantee landslide stability results in a significant decrease in total sediment volume and no landslide induced life and economic losses at all however ensuring landslide stability during reservoir operation can pose potential risk to the reservoir system as the reservoir water level may fail to drop to 145 m to allow for incoming floods during high flow years like the year of 1991 fig 11d it is important to keep in mind that the proposed operation scenarios are only for illustrative use and do not indicate actual operation policies of the china three gorges corporation it is also important to note that reservoir operation is a very complex decision making process because of its multiple and usually conflicting targets any advice on how to design dispatching rules can not be possible without conducting a thorough investigation of varying inflow conditions potential conflicting targets and various operation scenarios it is our expectation that the proposed sdsa methodology can be effectively used in the process of deriving reservoir friendly operation however derivation of reservoir dispatching rules is beyond the scope of this research based on the results obtained from the illustrative case study the following future research tasks can be attempted in investigating the friendly operation of the tgr 1 how to generate as much electricity and avoid abrupt drop of reservoir water level during the reservoir fill up and drawdown periods 2 how to balance the needs of reservoir fill up and releasing of fish flow during the sturgeon spawning season 3 more experiments should be conducted to reveal the mechanisms of the reservoir water level fluctuation on sediment flushing and landslide stability and 4 explore the trade offs between ensuring a maximum allowable water level drop rate and the potential risk of the failure of reservoir water level dropping down to 145 m during the reservoir drawdown period 6 data availability statement all data models or code generated or used during the study are available from

5 interactions among agricultural water consumptions of the three countries i e kazakhstan uzbekistan and tajikistan and interactions between evapotranspiration and agricultural water consumptions have noticeable effects on isa ii during 1992 2015 the main factors are agricultural water consumption of uzbekistan 21 4 upstream inflow 19 0 agricultural water consumption of kazakhstan 16 0 agricultural water consumption of tajikistan 14 2 industrial water consumption of uzbekistan 9 4 interactions among agricultural water consumptions of the three countries and interactions between upstream inflow and agricultural water consumptions have important effects on isa iii the contribution of agricultural activity decreases from 69 3 in 1960 1991 to 51 6 in 1992 2015 the findings are helpful for decision makers to formulate effective strategies to increase the runoff of the syr darya and restore the eco environment of the aral sea keywords agricultural water consumption bayesian neural network factorial analysis interactive effect north aral sea syr darya 1 introduction the aral sea has suffered from an unprecedented shrinkage over the past decades in 1960 2015 the water quantity of the aral sea reduced by more than 95 from 1089 km3 to 48 km3 and the surface area shrank by nearly 90 from 67 499 km2 to 6990 km2 micklin 2016 the salinity of the aral sea increased rapidly from 10 g l to more than 150 g l leading to a significant decline of the species diversity and biological productivity aladin et al 2018 the vast exposed former lakebed turned into a special saline desert which accumulated more than 1 billion tons of salt and transported about 20 million ton year of salty dust to the surrounding region kozhoridze et al 2012 issanova et al 2015 moreover the shrinkage of the aral sea aggravated the destruction of oasis the salinization of farmland the deterioration of regional climate and the pollution of water body which posed great threats to human health ecological environment and social economy hummel 2017 burr et al 2019 the syr darya is one of the major rivers feeding the aral sea which contributes about 40 of the lake s total water quantity nezlin et al 2004 in 1960 2015 the inflow from the syr darya to the aral sea isa decreased sharply from 21 2 km3 to 4 3 km3 ultimately leading to the shrinkage of the lake cawater 2020 therefore it is urgent to simulate the variation of isa and identify the main reason of the runoff reduction previously numerous machine learning methods were used for runoff simulation sedighi et al 2016 han and coulibaly 2017 liang et al 2018 sauter et al 2009 used an artificial neural network ann tool to simulate the hydrological process in an alpine catchment area of andes chile revealing that precipitation is the dominant factor of influencing the upstream runoff huang et al 2016 employed a support vector machine svm method to analyze the runoff of the wei river china indicating that human activity is the primary driver for runoff decrease during the last decades zhuang et al 2016 developed a stepwise cluster analysis sca method to simulate runoff of the kaidu river china results indicated that minimum temperature and precipitation have significant effects on the river runoff avanzi et al 2019 used a random forest rf algorithm to investigate the relationship between snowpack runoff and weather snow conditions results indicated that rainfall longwave radiation and snow surface temperature are important factors affecting snowpack runoff in general svm is effective in processing small sample data however its performance extremely depends on selection of internal parameters li et al 2020 sca can realize runoff simulation without assumption of determined linear nonlinear functions nevertheless its cluster tree is incapable of producing outputs beyond the training set sun et al 2018 rf can simulate runoff in an ensemble and random manner to mitigate the error of a single decision tree conversely it is sensitive to the allocation of training data belgiu and dragut 2016 as a most widely used machine learning method ann has advantages in parallel data processing and nonlinear modeling with swift response and high accuracy sedighi et al 2016 amroune et al 2018 conventional ann is trained by adjusting the values of network parameters i e connection weights and biases over multiple iterations till a single optimal set that can minimize the error function is obtained this manner may lead the ann to overreact to the trivial fluctuations i e noise in the training data thus failing to reflect the intrinsic relationship of the entire population jana et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 mishra and karmakar 2019 this overfitting problem occurs mainly due to without considering the uncertainty of network parameter khan and coulibaly 2006 in fact the relationship between input factors and river runoff is perturbed by substantial uncertainties which are associated with randomness of hydrological processes and inaccuracy of observation data zhang et al 2009 liu et al 2017 a single set of deterministic weights is incapable of reflecting these uncertainties and thus inappropriate for a real world hydrological problem jana et al 2008 bayesian technique is an attractive way to deal with the above obstacle in which uncertain parameters are initially described by prior distributions before observing data and then the posterior distributions can be obtained based on the bayesian inference utama et al 2016 karmakar and maiti 2019 bayesian training of neural network can obtain a range of weights rather than a single value which in turn yields a distribution of the output niu and liang 2018 due to the capabilities of controlling model complex and reducing overfitting problem bayesian neural network bnn has been widely applied to financial engineered and hydrological fields khan and coulibaly 2006 ticknor 2013 arangio and bontempi 2015 sholahudin et al 2019 for example zhang et al 2009 used bnn for daily runoff simulations of the reynolds creek and little river watersheds america results indicated that bnn is effective in performing uncertainty analysis and has superior generalization capacity to the deterministic ann humphrey et al 2016 developed a monthly streamflow forecasting model based on bnn and applied it to three catchments in the south east of south australia an excellent performance with the nash sutcliffe efficiency being 0 89 for the validation phase was found generally bnn is effective in accurately capturing the nonlinear relationship between inputs and river runoff however as a black box model it is insufficient in quantitatively analyzing the effects of different factors on the runoff shoaib et al 2016 ali et al 2019 sensitivity analysis is then necessary for post optimization wang et al 2013 conventional sensitivity analysis is performed by varying one factor over its range with the other factors held constant which can only reflect the individual effects of factors and fail to explore the interactions among them zhou and huang 2011 factorial analysis fa a multivariate inference method can effectively reveal the interactive effects of multiple factors through calculating the variations in simulation responses under different combinations of factors levels un et al 2015 previously fa has been widely used in experiments and hydrological modeling mabilia et al 2010 onsekizoglu et al 2010 liu et al 2019 however no previous study was conducted to reflect the effects of multiple factors and their interactions on river runoff through coupling bnn with fa technique the objective of this study is to develop a bayesian neural network based factorial analysis bnn fa method through incorporating bayesian neural network bnn and factorial analysis fa within a general framework then the bnn fa method will be applied to the downstream of the syr darya river basin plain area with elevation less than 300 m for quantitatively analyzing the effects of multiple factors e g human activity hydrological and ecological on the inflow from the syr darya to the aral sea isa since the disintegration of the soviet union posed great geopolitical impacts on this region it is necessary to analyze the effects of multiple factors on isa in the pre disintegration prd and post disintegration pod periods respectively 2 methodology fig 1 presents the general framework of the bnn fa method bnn is used for capturing the nonlinear relationship between isa and human activity hydrological and ecological factors with the consideration of parameter uncertainty fa is used for analyzing individual and interactive effects of multiple factors based on the trained bnn model ann is used for further illustrating the effectiveness of bnn in isa simulation 2 1 artificial neural network artificial neural network ann can approximate the nonlinear relationship between input and output by adjusting the network parameters weights and biases in an iterative manner liu et al 2020 the equation that expresses the relationship between the input and output can be written as utama et al 2016 1 y f output j 1 h w j f hidden i 1 n w ij x i b j b output where n is the number of input neurons h is the number of neurons in the hidden layer y is the actual output of ann xi is the ith input unit wij is the weight parameter between input i and hidden neuron j wj is the weight parameter between hidden neuron j and the output neuron fhidden is the activation function of the hidden layer foutput is the transfer function of the output layer bj is the bias of the hidden neuron j boutput is the bias of the output neuron the error function is defined as karmakar and maiti 2019 2 e d w 1 2 k 1 n y k x k w t k 2 where d d x k t k k 1 n is the training set w is the weight including bias xk is the input data yk is the actual output of the neutral network tk is the target value the error ed w was fed backward through the network to optimize the weights until the error was acceptable for the network model one of the techniques for optimizing the weights is levenberg marquardt lm algorithm kumar and rajasekhar 2017 the weights of ann with lm algorithm can be calculated as shi et al 2019 3 w m 1 w m j m t j m μ m i 1 j m t e m where m is the number of iterations e m e m 1 e m 2 e m n t is the error vector containing the output errors for each input vector in the training set jm is the jacobian matrix of the mth iteration of output errors i is the identity matrix μm is the learning parameter μm 0 matrix j m t j m μ m i in the right hand is positive definite and invertible madaen et al 2004 proof for the positive definiteness and invertibility is provided in appendix a to this paper 2 2 bayesian neural network in the traditional deterministic training of ann a single set of weight w is identified in bnn w is considered as a random variable and the optimization of w can be taken as a problem of bayesian inference the key principle of bayesian training is to derive the posterior probability distribution of w based on the observed data and prior knowledge of parameters burden and winkler 2008 in the training process a weight decay item is added to the error function i e eq 2 to reduce the potential of overfitting hyper parameters i e α and β are then introduced to the new objective function bayesian inference is also used for determination of the posterior probability distribution of α and β when weights and hyper parameters are determined distributions of the network outputs can be derived according to the rule of conditional probability 2 2 1 objective function of bayesian neural network training neural network based on ed w may lead to overfitting problem and decrease the generalization capability of ann ticknor 2013 therefore in bayesian neural network bnn the objective function is defined as gao et al 2015 4a s w β e d w α e w w 4b e w w 1 2 i m w i 2 where ew w is the weight decay item m is total number of weights including biases α and β are the error function parameters also known as hyper parameters kocadagli and asikgil 2014 suitable values for α and β in s w are important for the neural network when α is much smaller than β the weight would be allowed to be large and the noise in the data would be overfitted when α is much larger than β underfitting problem would occur in bnn α and β are also optimized in the bayesian training process the most probable values of α and β can be obtained as lauret et al 2008 5a α mp γ 2 e w w mp 5b β mp n γ 2 e d w mp 5c γ m α t r a c e a 1 where γ is the effective number of parameters necessary for the network a is the hessian matrix of s w the inference procedure for the optimal hyper parameters is provided in appendix b to this paper substituting eqs 5a and 5b into 4a objective function s w would become n 2 therefore the iterative learning process of bnn would be terminated when s w converge to half of the sample size of the training set as shown in fig 1 in this study the iteration is terminated when the change in s w is less than 0 1 2 2 2 posterior distribution of the weight bayesian training framework is started with a suitable prior distribution of weights before observing the data once the data is observed bayesian inference is used for obtaining the posterior probability distribution as follows bui et al 2012 6 p w d α β p d w β p w α p d α β where p w α is the prior probability distribution of w p d w β is the likelihood function which is the probability of error p d α β is the normalization factor named evidence for the model assuming that the weight has a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1 α and the noise of the target data has a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1 β the posterior probability distribution of w can be written as niu and liang 2018 7 p w d α β 1 z m α β exp β e d α e w 1 z m α β exp s w the inference procedure is provided in appendix b to this paper from eq 7 training the network with the aim of minimizing the function s w corresponds to maximizing the posterior distribution of the network parameter w 2 2 3 distribution of the network output the distribution of the output from bnn can be expressed as karmakar and maiti 2019 8a p t x d 1 2 π σ t 2 1 2 exp t y x w mp 2 2 σ t 2 8b σ t 2 1 β g t a 1 g where wmp is the most probable value for the weight vector which corresponds to the maximum of the posterior probability and minimum of s w y x wmp is the mean value of the output σt is the standard deviation of the output a is the hessian matrix of s w g is the gradient of y x w with respect to weight w evaluated at wmp for each input vector x 95 confidence interval ci of the mean network output y x wmp can be estimated by zhang et al 2011 9a y x low y x w mp 1 96 σ t 9b y x up y x w mp 1 96 σ t where y x low is the lower bound of 95 ci y x up is the upper bound of 95 ci 2 2 4 determination of network structure identifying the number of hidden neurons is a key issue for neural network for a network with n input neurons one hidden layer and one output neuron each additional hidden neuron introduces n 2 new weights burden and winkler 2008 in ann a highly complex model would overfit to the training data and thus has poor performance in the validation period in bnn due to the introduction of weight decay item in the objective function too complicated models are penalized as unnecessary weights are driven to zero thus whatever the complexity of the network is overfitting does not occur in bnn through increasing the number of hidden neurons until the performance of calibration no longer improves the network structure can be determined mean squared errors mse between simulated and observed data were used to examine the performances of different models in validation and calibration periods khalili 2018 10 mse 1 n i 1 n is a obs i is a sim i 2 where n is the number of samples isa obs i is the observed isa isa sim i is the simulated isa in this study bnn models with different hidden neurons were trained 50 times to eliminate the spurious effect the performances of the selected ann and bnn models are evaluated by coefficient of correlation r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and mean absolute percentage error mape as follows wang et al 2019 11 r 2 n i 1 n is a obs i is a sim i i 1 n is a obs i i 1 n is a sim i 2 n i 1 n isa obs i 2 i 1 n is a obs i 2 n i 1 n isa sim i 2 i 1 n is a sim i 2 12 nse 1 i 1 n is a obs i is a sim i 2 i 1 n is a obs i is a obs 2 13 mape 1 n i 1 n is a sim i is a obs i is a obs i 100 where is a obs is mean of observed isa the closer r2 and nse values to 1 and the closer mape value to 0 the better the model performance sun et al 2018 generally a model with r2 and nse higher than 0 7 and mape lower than 3 can be considered as reliable zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2019 in addition the kolmogorov smirnov k s test was used for examining the normality of the distribution of errors xu et al 2019 the statistic of k s dks is defined as the maximum difference between the sample cumulative probability and the normal cumulative probability kroll et al 2015 14 d ks max f x s x where f x and s x are the normal and observed cumulative distribution functions evaluated at error x the null hypothesis is that the errors are normally distributed which is accepted at level α if dks dcrit the largest theoretical difference acceptable for the k s test at the significance level α su et al 2017 in this study significance level α was set to be 0 05 thus when the observed significance level p larger than 0 05 the null hypothesis is accepted at 95 confidence level and the errors are considered as normally distributed awange et al 2019 2 3 factorial analysis factorial analysis fa a multivariate inference method can effectively reveal the individual and interactive effects of multiple factors on river runoff through factorial design un et al 2015 an important case of factorial analysis is two level factorial design which is implemented at low l and high h levels for each of k factors leading to 2 k treatment combinations then the sum of squares for individual factor can be calculated by the statistic model as follows montgomery 2012 15 s s a 1 jt i 1 i j 1 j t 1 t y ijt 2 1 ijt i 1 i j 1 j t 1 t y ijt 2 16 s s b 1 it j 1 j i 1 i t 1 t y ijt 2 1 ijt i 1 i j 1 j t 1 t y ijt 2 17 s s c 1 ij t 1 t i 1 i j 1 j y ijt 2 1 ijt i 1 i j 1 j t 1 t y ijt 2 where ssa ssb and ssc denote the sums of squares of factors a b and c yijt denotes the system response under the ith level of factor a jth level of factor b and tth level of factor c i j and t denote the numbers of levels of a b and c contribution of each factor to isa can be obtained by calculating the proportion of its sum of squares to the total sum of squares zhang et al 2016 the sum of squares for two factor interaction can be calculated by montgomery 2012 18 s s a b 1 t i 1 i j 1 j t 1 t y ijt 2 1 ijt i 1 i j 1 j t 1 t y ijt 2 s s a s s b 19 s s a c 1 j i 1 i t 1 t j 1 j y ijt 2 1 ijt i 1 i j 1 j

study only six factors with significant main effect on isa were selected for analyzing interactive effect 3 case study the syr darya is one of the two major rivers feeding the aral sea it originates from the pamir and tien shan plateaus running approximately 2500 km across the territories of kyrgyzstan tajikistan uzbekistan and kazakhstan before finally flowing into the aral sea cai et al 2002 since the aral sea separated into two water bodies i e north aral sea and south aral sea in 1987 the syr darya has been flowed into the north aral sea micklin 2016 the annual mean runoff of the syr darya is 14 1 km3 which is mainly formed from glacier and snow melting in the upstream jilili and ma 2015 the area of downstream of the syr darya river basin is about 0 6 106 km2 containing eight districts i e kyzylorda and south kazakhstan in kazakhstan tashkent dzhizak syrdar ya namangan and fergana in uzbekistan and khudzhand in tajikistan as shown in fig 2 the region is dominated by broad desert plains along the river support some vegetations and settlements the region is characterized by temperate continental arid climate with average annual temperature of 14 2 c and precipitation of 60 mm yao and chen 2015 in 2015 the population of the study area was approximately 19 1 million and the urbanization rate was 43 4 cawater 2020 the gross domestic product gdp was 64 5 billion with about 87 3 of the total value being from industry and 12 7 being from agriculture cawater 2020 human have practiced irrigation in the syr darya river basin for at least three millennia however until the 1960s irrigation agriculture did not substantially diminish runoff of the syr darya owing to substantial return flows from irrigated fields and other compensatory factors micklin 2016 since 1960 due to the decision of soviet administration to expand cotton and rice agriculture intensive irrigation system that diverts runoff of the syr darya to cultivated land was developed leading to a sharp decrease of isa aladin et al 2018 shen et al 2018 about 90 of the water withdrawn from the river was used for irrigation cawater 2020 excepted for irrigation agriculture growing municipal and industrial water demands also exacerbated the decrease of isa moreover rainfall evapotranspiration upstream inflow and natural vegetation are important factors causing the variation of isa bocchiola et al 2017 gao et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 quantitatively analyzing the effects of multiple factors on isa is thus crucial for facilitating sustainable water management the geo political context of the syr darya river basin further complicated the regional water resource management during soviet era the uzbek and kazakh soviet socialist republics ssrs in downstream of the syr darya river basin were designated as agricultural production bases with the kyrgyz and tajik ssrs in the upstream designated as water suppliers sorg et al 2014 the cost of water management and the loss of water resources in the upstream of ssrs were subsidized from soviet central funds or compensated by the downstream of ssrs in terms of cheap fuel electricity and food provision kemelova and zhalkubaev 2003 after the disintegration of the soviet union the syr darya became an international river basin covering territories of four newly independent states the riparian states have failed to put forward a feasible regional agreement to replace the soviet subsidized system lee and jung 2018 the downstream countries require more water in summer for their expanding cotton and rice production whereas the upstream countries with little fossil energy are trying to store water in summer and release water in winter for hydropower production sorg et al 2014 the timing problems leave the downstream of the syr darya river basin suffering from water shortage in summer and relatively surplus in winter in this study monthly human activity hydrological and ecological data with a time span of 56 years 1960 2015 are used for simulating isa table 1 presents the considered factors and their data sources these data are divided into two sets data from 1960 to 1991 384 samples for analyzing effects of multiple factors on isa in period of prd and data from 1991 to 2015 288 samples for period of pod for both prd and pod 80 of the total samples are used for calibration and 20 are used for validation these calibration and validation thresholds are widely used in machine learning techniques ticknor 2013 humphrey et al 2016 the calibration and validation sets are assigned randomly 4 result and discussion 4 1 effectiveness of bayesian neural network fig 3 presents the mse of different ann and bnn models mse of ann decreases for calibration and increases for validation when the number of hidden neurons increases from 1 to 15 a highly complex ann model e g the ann model with 15 hidden neurons overfits the training data and thus has poor performance in the validation period however for bnn prd or bnn pod model increasing the number of hidden neurons from 11 or 9 to 15 makes essentially no difference to the mse this is mainly due to the introduction of weight decay item in the objective function too complicated models are penalized as unnecessary weights are driven to zero therefore in this study 11 and 9 hidden neurons were selected for bnn prd and bnn pod models respectively ann models used the same structures for comparison fig 4 a presents r2 nse and mape of the ann models results indicate that ann has a good performance in calibration but poor in validation for example in ann prd model r2 nse and mape of calibration are 0 923 0 923 and 1 96 respectively while those of validation are 0 595 0 468 and 4 48 respectively fig 4a also presents the distribution of errors through dividing them into 15 intervals evenly to further illustrate the model s performance errors in calibration of ann prd randomly and evenly distributed around zero with a mean of 0 00 and a strand deviation sd of 141 67 the p value in the k s test is 0 000 smaller than 0 05 which rejects the null hypothesis that the errors are normally distributed this is mainly because the kurtosis of the errors distribution is higher than the normal distribution curve which further demonstrates the great performance of the ann prd model in calibration phase however in validation the ann prd model has a poor performance as the mean and sd are 55 83 and 394 48 respectively the errors are not normally distributed due to the large sd it could be concluded form the results that even has 11 or 9 hidden neurons the ann models also overfit to the noise of the training data and fail in capturing the intrinsic relationship between input factors and isa fig 4b presents the performances of the bnn models results indicate that bnn performs marginally worse in calibration but much better in validation compared to ann for example r2 nse and mape of bnn prd are 0 814 0 814 and 2 77 in calibration and 0 870 0 846 and 2 47 in validation respectively the mean of errors in validation 37 64 is closer to zero and the sd 199 32 is smaller than those of ann prd this result indicates that bnn can effectively reduce the problem of overfitting which strength the generalization capacity for new data this is mainly because the consideration of parameter uncertainty allows bnn to obtain output through integrating over its posterior probability distribution which avoids the error of single value fig 5 presents the mean network output and its 95 confidence interval for every input vector in calibration and validation phases results indicate that there is a good agreement between simulated and observed isa almost all of the observed values are within the 95 confidence intervals of the mean network outputs in summary the trained bnn models can effectively capture the complex nonlinear relationship between input factors and isa which guarantees the credibility of the subsequent analysis 4 2 main factors affecting isa the effects of 15 factors were investigated based on the factorial analysis technique each factor was designed into two levels low and high corresponding to the 20th and 80th percentiles of all values leading to 215 treatment combinations sun et al 2018 fig 6 presents the distribution and the 20th and 80th percentiles for each factor table 2 shows the serial number of the 215 treatment combinations isa simulation with the trained bnn model was then launched for each of the treatment combinations fig 7 presents the simulated results for prd the highest lowest and average isa of the 215 treatments are 9 20 109 m3 11 10 109 m3 and 0 73 109 m3 respectively for pod the highest lowest and average isa are 0 93 109 m3 0 35 109 m3 and 0 28 109 m3 respectively the large fluctuation range of isa demonstrates the sensitivity of the bnn fa method many negative values for isa are found in fig 7 this is because the combinations of factor levels are constructed artificially to investigate the effects of factors comprehensively the result of factorial design is not a simulation of the real world fig 8 presents main effects of individual factors on isa take the plot of aw u in prd as an example isa decreases from 2 18 109 m3 to 0 73 109 m3 with aw u increasing from its low level of 612 3 106 m3 to high level of 2860 9 106 m3 the slope of the line is negative indicating that aw u has negative effect on isa compared with other factors aw u has the steepest slope implying that aw u has the greatest magnitude of main effect on isa the horizontal line represents the mean value of isa in prd from the results aw k aw t et and rs also have obvious negative effects on isa in period of prd ndvi and ui has slightly positive effects in period of pod factors of aw k aw t aw u and rs still have significant negative effects on isa indicating that irrigated agriculture remains the primary water consumer in the syr darya river basin iw u and et have negative effects on isa and ui has positive effect the slope of ui is larger than that in prd indicating an increasing impact of ui on isa fig 9 a shows the contributions of factors to the variation of isa in period of prd results indicate that aw u is the most significant factor to isa with a contribution of 31 2 followed by aw k 23 8 and aw t 14 3 this is mainly because uzbekistan has the largest area of cultivated land in downstream of the syr darya river basin among the three riparian countries rs is also an important factor whose contribution is 10 6 this is mainly due to the large scale construction of reservoirs in period of prd to promote agricultural irrigation et has a relatively high contribution to isa 7 5 while rf has the smallest 0 1 this is mainly attributed to the arid climate i e high evapotranspiration and low rainfall in the central asia in general human activity factor has the most significant impact on the variation of isa with a total contribution of 88 9 the followings are hydrological and ecological factors with the total contributions being 8 7 and 2 4 respectively among human activities agriculture has the most significant impact on isa with the contribution being 69 3 fig 9b illustrates the contributions of different factors to isa in period of pod aw u remains the most significant factor to isa with a contribution of 21 4 contributions of aw k and aw t are 16 0 and 14 2 respectively contribution of iw u increases slightly from 4 8 to 9 4 due to the development of industry in uzbekistan the largest difference occurs in factor of ui whose contribution increases from 1 1 in prd to 19 1 in pod this is mainly because the disintegration of the soviet union and the consequent dispute between the upstream countries and downstream countries the timing problems leave the study area downstream of the syr darya river basin suffering from water shortage in summer and relatively surplus in winter which increases the impact of ui on isa in pod human activity remains the most significant factor to isa with a total contribution of 72 8 the followings are hydrological and ecological factors with the total contributions being 23 4 and 3 8 respectively agricultural water consumption has the most significant impact on isa with the contribution being 51 6 4 3 interactive effects of multiple factors on isa six significant factors were selected for the analysis of interactive effects on isa table 3 shows sum of squares for two factor interaction results indicate that in prd interactions among agricultural water consumptions of the three countries i e aw k aw t aw k aw u and aw t aw u and interactions between et and agricultural water consumptions i e et aw k et aw t and et aw u have important effects on isa aw t aw k has the most significant interaction with the sum of squares being 12 4 1015 in pod interactions among agricultural water consumptions of the three countries interactions between ui and agricultural water consumptions i e aw k ui aw t ui aw u ui and interaction between aw u and iw u have noticeable effects on isa aw u ui has the largest interactive effect with the sum of squares being 20 7 1012 fig 10 presents the matrix of interaction plots in prd which further illustrates the specific manners of the interactions between different factors note that the interaction plot of aw k aw t row 1 column 1 when aw t is at low level aw k has a slight negative effect on isa 1 3 109 m3 when aw t is at high level aw k has a significant negative effect 3 8 109 m3 the impact of aw t on aw k can be measured by the gap between the two effects 2 5 109 m3 from the results the impact of aw u on aw k is 2 1 109 m3 and the impact of aw u on aw t is 1 9 109 m3 this is mainly because when the agricultural water consumption of one country is at high level the resource competition will increase the sensitivity of isa to another countries agricultural water consumption the results imply the importance for simultaneously optimizing the agricultural water consumptions of kazakhstan uzbekistan and tajikistan moreover the effects of aw k aw t and aw u depend on the level of et in detail the negative effects of aw k aw t and aw u on isa increase 1 9 109 m3 1 7 109 m3 and 1 7 109 m3 respectively when et varies from its low level to high level this is mainly because high level evapotranspiration means less water resource available for irrigated agriculture which increases the sensitivity of isa to agricultural water consumption fig 11 presents the matrix of interaction plots in pod results indicate that interactions still exist in aw k aw t aw k aw u and aw t aw u with the impacts being 61 106 m3 93 106 m3 and 91 106 m3 respectively in addition interactions between ui and agricultural water consumptions have noticeable effects on isa when ui is at low level aw k aw t and aw u have obvious negative effects on isa 145 106 m3 135 106 m3 and 170 106 m3 respectively when ui is at high level these effects reduce to 64 106 m3 61 106 m3 and 70 106 m3 respectively this is mainly because high level upstream inflow relieves the water stress in downstream of the syr darya river basin results also indicate that the effect of aw u depends on the level of iw u the negative effect of aw u on isa decreases by 74 106 m3 when ui varies from its low level to high level this indicates that development of industry in uzbekistan can reduce the effect of agriculture on isa 4 4 sensitivity of bnn fa to non agricultural factors through the proposed bnn fa method agricultural water consumption was identified to be the dominated factor that affects the water resource in the syr darya river basin which is in accordance with previous scientific literatures beek et al 2011 lee and jung 2018 in fact the bnn fa method is also sensitive to the other non agricultural factors with factors aw k aw t and aw u being at their high level and keeping unchanged the factorial design for the other 12 factors can be obtained fig 12 presents the simulated isa under 212 combinations of non agricultural factor levels for prd the lowest and highest isa are 11 10 109 m3 and 2 55 109 m3 respectively the fluctuation range is 13 65 109 m3 which occupies 67 2 of the fluctuation range in the complete 215 factorial design as shown in fig 7 for pod the lowest and highest isa are 0 35 109 m3 and 0 57 109 m3 respectively the fluctuation range of the 212 factorial design is 0 92 109 m3 occupying 71 9 of the complete factorial design the results indicate that bnn fa can give enough responses to the variations of non agricultural factors which demonstrates its sensitivity in determining the contributions of all factors it can be concluded that the bnn fa method is also applicable for the other case studies where the influence of one factor is not so evident 5 conclusions in this study a bayesian neural network based factorial analysis bnn fa method has been developed for quantitatively analyzing effects of multiple factors on isa through integrating techniques of bayesian neural network bnn and factorial analysis fa into a general framework the bnn fa method has been proved to be effective in i reflecting the complex nonlinear relationship between input factors and river runoff ii assessing parameter uncertainty with bayesian inference to reduce the overfitting problem and iii revealing the individual and interactive effects of multiple factors on river runoff then the bnn fa method has been applied to the downstream of the syr darya river basin where effects of human activity hydrological and ecological factors have been analyzed results indicate that i in period of prd the major factors affecting isa are aw u 31 2 aw k 23 8 aw t 14 3 rs 10 6 et 7 5 interactions among agricultural water consumptions of the three countries and interactions between et and agricultural water consumptions have noticeable effects on isa ii in period of pod the major factors are aw u 21 4 ui 19 0 aw k 16 0 aw t 14 2 iw u 9 4 interactions among agricultural water consumptions of the three countries and interactions between ui and agricultural water consumptions have important effects on isa iii the contribution of agricultural activity has a decreased trend from 69 3 in prd to 51 6 in pod iv due to the disintegration of the soviet union and the consequent international dispute the contribution of ui increases obviously from 1 1 in prd to 19 1 in pod the findings are helpful for decision makers to formulate effective strategies to increase the runoff of the syr darya and restore the eco environment of the aral sea although the proposed bnn fa method has proven to be effective in quantitatively analyzing effects of multiple factors on isa some limitations exist in this study bnn fa is actually a system theoretical model that cannot characterize the physical mechanism of hydrological process thus conceptual or physically based hydrological models are desired to be incorporated into bnn fa to reveal the internal hydrological sub process of the syr darya river basin only 15 factors associated with human activity hydrological process and ecosystem were investigated in this study some other factors such as water management measure agricultural policy land use change population temperature and groundwater level could also affect isa more factors should be considered in future studies to obtain a more accurate simulation two level factorial analysis was used in the bnn fa method which can hardly reflect the nonlinear response of river runoff to variation of factor levels factorial analysis with three or more factor levels is desired in future research in addition this study only identified the major factors for the variation of isa based on the last decades data forecasting of isa should be conducted in the future to explore the specific measures to increase the runoff of the

5432,in this study a bayesian neural network based factorial analysis abbreviated as bnn fa method is developed for quantifying the effects of multiple factors on inflow from the syr darya to the aral sea abbreviated as isa bnn fa cannot only reflect the complex relationship between inputs and outputs but also reveal the individual and interactive effects of multiple factors bnn fa is applied to the downstream of the syr darya river basin where effects of human activity hydrological and ecological factors are analyzed results reveal that i during 1960 1991 the main factors affecting isa are agricultural water consumption of uzbekistan 31 2 agricultural water consumption of kazakhstan 23 8 agricultural water consumption of tajikistan 14 3 reservoir water storage 10 6 evapotranspiration 7 5 interactions among agricultural water consumptions of the three countries i e kazakhstan uzbekistan and tajikistan and interactions between evapotranspiration and agricultural water consumptions have noticeable effects on isa ii during 1992 2015 the main factors are agricultural water consumption of uzbekistan 21 4 upstream inflow 19 0 agricultural water consumption of kazakhstan 16 0 agricultural water consumption of tajikistan 14 2 industrial water consumption of uzbekistan 9 4 interactions among agricultural water consumptions of the three countries and interactions between upstream inflow and agricultural water consumptions have important effects on isa iii the contribution of agricultural activity decreases from 69 3 in 1960 1991 to 51 6 in 1992 2015 the findings are helpful for decision makers to formulate effective strategies to increase the runoff of the syr darya and restore the eco environment of the aral sea keywords agricultural water consumption bayesian neural network factorial analysis interactive effect north aral sea syr darya 1 introduction the aral sea has suffered from an unprecedented shrinkage over the past decades in 1960 2015 the water quantity of the aral sea reduced by more than 95 from 1089 km3 to 48 km3 and the surface area shrank by nearly 90 from 67 499 km2 to 6990 km2 micklin 2016 the salinity of the aral sea increased rapidly from 10 g l to more than 150 g l leading to a significant decline of the species diversity and biological productivity aladin et al 2018 the vast exposed former lakebed turned into a special saline desert which accumulated more than 1 billion tons of salt and transported about 20 million ton year of salty dust to the surrounding region kozhoridze et al 2012 issanova et al 2015 moreover the shrinkage of the aral sea aggravated the destruction of oasis the salinization of farmland the deterioration of regional climate and the pollution of water body which posed great threats to human health ecological environment and social economy hummel 2017 burr et al 2019 the syr darya is one of the major rivers feeding the aral sea which contributes about 40 of the lake s total water quantity nezlin et al 2004 in 1960 2015 the inflow from the syr darya to the aral sea isa decreased sharply from 21 2 km3 to 4 3 km3 ultimately leading to the shrinkage of the lake cawater 2020 therefore it is urgent to simulate the variation of isa and identify the main reason of the runoff reduction previously numerous machine learning methods were used for runoff simulation sedighi et al 2016 han and coulibaly 2017 liang et al 2018 sauter et al 2009 used an artificial neural network ann tool to simulate the hydrological process in an alpine catchment area of andes chile revealing that precipitation is the dominant factor of influencing the upstream runoff huang et al 2016 employed a support vector machine svm method to analyze the runoff of the wei river china indicating that human activity is the primary driver for runoff decrease during the last decades zhuang et al 2016 developed a stepwise cluster analysis sca method to simulate runoff of the kaidu river china results indicated that minimum temperature and precipitation have significant effects on the river runoff avanzi et al 2019 used a random forest rf algorithm to investigate the relationship between snowpack runoff and weather snow conditions results indicated that rainfall longwave radiation and snow surface temperature are important factors affecting snowpack runoff in general svm is effective in processing small sample data however its performance extremely depends on selection of internal parameters li et al 2020 sca can realize runoff simulation without assumption of determined linear nonlinear functions nevertheless its cluster tree is incapable of producing outputs beyond the training set sun et al 2018 rf can simulate runoff in an ensemble and random manner to mitigate the error of a single decision tree conversely it is sensitive to the allocation of training data belgiu and dragut 2016 as a most widely used machine learning method ann has advantages in parallel data processing and nonlinear modeling with swift response and high accuracy sedighi et al 2016 amroune et al 2018 conventional ann is trained by adjusting the values of network parameters i e connection weights and biases over multiple iterations till a single optimal set that can minimize the error function is obtained this manner may lead the ann to overreact to the trivial fluctuations i e noise in the training data thus failing to reflect the intrinsic relationship of the entire population jana et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 mishra and karmakar 2019 this overfitting problem occurs mainly due to without considering the uncertainty of network parameter khan and coulibaly 2006 in fact the relationship between input factors and river runoff is perturbed by substantial uncertainties which are associated with randomness of hydrological processes and inaccuracy of observation data zhang et al 2009 liu et al 2017 a single set of deterministic weights is incapable of reflecting these uncertainties and thus inappropriate for a real world hydrological problem jana et al 2008 bayesian technique is an attractive way to deal with the above obstacle in which uncertain parameters are initially described by prior distributions before observing data and then the posterior distributions can be obtained based on the bayesian inference utama et al 2016 karmakar and maiti 2019 bayesian training of neural network can obtain a range of weights rather than a single value which in turn yields a distribution of the output niu and liang 2018 due to the capabilities of controlling model complex and reducing overfitting problem bayesian neural network bnn has been widely applied to financial engineered and hydrological fields khan and coulibaly 2006 ticknor 2013 arangio and bontempi 2015 sholahudin et al 2019 for example zhang et al 2009 used bnn for daily runoff simulations of the reynolds creek and little river watersheds america results indicated that bnn is effective in performing uncertainty analysis and has superior generalization capacity to the deterministic ann humphrey et al 2016 developed a monthly streamflow forecasting model based on bnn and applied it to three catchments in the south east of south australia an excellent performance with the nash sutcliffe efficiency being 0 89 for the validation phase was found generally bnn is effective in accurately capturing the nonlinear relationship between inputs and river runoff however as a black box model it is insufficient in quantitatively analyzing the effects of different factors on the runoff shoaib et al 2016 ali et al 2019 sensitivity analysis is then necessary for post optimization wang et al 2013 conventional sensitivity analysis is performed by varying one factor over its range with the other factors held constant which can only reflect the individual effects of factors and fail to explore the interactions among them zhou and huang 2011 factorial analysis fa a multivariate inference method can effectively reveal the interactive effects of multiple factors through calculating the variations in simulation responses under different combinations of factors levels un et al 2015 previously fa has been widely used in experiments and hydrological modeling mabilia et al 2010 onsekizoglu et al 2010 liu et al 2019 however no previous study was conducted to reflect the effects of multiple factors and their interactions on river runoff through coupling bnn with fa technique the objective of this study is to develop a bayesian neural network based factorial analysis bnn fa method through incorporating bayesian neural network bnn and factorial analysis fa within a general framework then the bnn fa method will be applied to the downstream of the syr darya river basin plain area with elevation less than 300 m for quantitatively analyzing the effects of multiple factors e g human activity hydrological and ecological on the inflow from the syr darya to the aral sea isa since the disintegration of the soviet union posed great geopolitical impacts on this region it is necessary to analyze the effects of multiple factors on isa in the pre disintegration prd and post disintegration pod periods respectively 2 methodology fig 1 presents the general framework of the bnn fa method bnn is used for capturing the nonlinear relationship between isa and human activity hydrological and ecological factors with the consideration of parameter uncertainty fa is used for analyzing individual and interactive effects of multiple factors based on the trained bnn model ann is used for further illustrating the effectiveness of bnn in isa simulation 2 1 artificial neural network artificial neural network ann can approximate the nonlinear relationship between input and output by adjusting the network parameters weights and biases in an iterative manner liu et al 2020 the equation that expresses the relationship between the input and output can be written as utama et al 2016 1 y f output j 1 h w j f hidden i 1 n w ij x i b j b output where n is the number of input neurons h is the number of neurons in the hidden layer y is the actual output of ann xi is the ith input unit wij is the weight parameter between input i and hidden neuron j wj is the weight parameter between hidden neuron j and the output neuron fhidden is the activation function of the hidden layer foutput is the transfer function of the output layer bj is the bias of the hidden neuron j boutput is the bias of the output neuron the error function is defined as karmakar and maiti 2019 2 e d w 1 2 k 1 n y k x k w t k 2 where d d x k t k k 1 n is the training set w is the weight including bias xk is the input data yk is the actual output of the neutral network tk is the target value the error ed w was fed backward through the network to optimize the weights until the error was acceptable for the network model one of the techniques for optimizing the weights is levenberg marquardt lm algorithm kumar and rajasekhar 2017 the weights of ann with lm algorithm can be calculated as shi et al 2019 3 w m 1 w m j m t j m μ m i 1 j m t e m where m is the number of iterations e m e m 1 e m 2 e m n t is the error vector containing the output errors for each input vector in the training set jm is the jacobian matrix of the mth iteration of output errors i is the identity matrix μm is the learning parameter μm 0 matrix j m t j m μ m i in the right hand is positive definite and invertible madaen et al 2004 proof for the positive definiteness and invertibility is provided in appendix a to this paper 2 2 bayesian neural network in the traditional deterministic training of ann a single set of weight w is identified in bnn w is considered as a random variable and the optimization of w can be taken as a problem of bayesian inference the key principle of bayesian training is to derive the posterior probability distribution of w based on the observed data and prior knowledge of parameters burden and winkler 2008 in the training process a weight decay item is added to the error function i e eq 2 to reduce the potential of overfitting hyper parameters i e α and β are then introduced to the new objective function bayesian inference is also used for determination of the posterior probability distribution of α and β when weights and hyper parameters are determined distributions of the network outputs can be derived according to the rule of conditional probability 2 2 1 objective function of bayesian neural network training neural network based on ed w may lead to overfitting problem and decrease the generalization capability of ann ticknor 2013 therefore in bayesian neural network bnn the objective function is defined as gao et al 2015 4a s w β e d w α e w w 4b e w w 1 2 i m w i 2 where ew w is the weight decay item m is total number of weights including biases α and β are the error function parameters also known as hyper parameters kocadagli and asikgil 2014 suitable values for α and β in s w are important for the neural network when α is much smaller than β the weight would be allowed to be large and the noise in the data would be overfitted when α is much larger than β underfitting problem would occur in bnn α and β are also optimized in the bayesian training process the most probable values of α and β can be obtained as lauret et al 2008 5a α mp γ 2 e w w mp 5b β mp n γ 2 e d w mp 5c γ m α t r a c e a 1 where γ is the effective number of parameters necessary for the network a is the hessian matrix of s w the inference procedure for the optimal hyper parameters is provided in appendix b to this paper substituting eqs 5a and 5b into 4a objective function s w would become n 2 therefore the iterative learning process of bnn would be terminated when s w converge to half of the sample size of the training set as shown in fig 1 in this study the iteration is terminated when the change in s w is less than 0 1 2 2 2 posterior distribution of the weight bayesian training framework is started with a suitable prior distribution of weights before observing the data once the data is observed bayesian inference is used for obtaining the posterior probability distribution as follows bui et al 2012 6 p w d α β p d w β p w α p d α β where p w α is the prior probability distribution of w p d w β is the likelihood function which is the probability of error p d α β is the normalization factor named evidence for the model assuming that the weight has a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1 α and the noise of the target data has a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1 β the posterior probability distribution of w can be written as niu and liang 2018 7 p w d α β 1 z m α β exp β e d α e w 1 z m α β exp s w the inference procedure is provided in appendix b to this paper from eq 7 training the network with the aim of minimizing the function s w corresponds to maximizing the posterior distribution of the network parameter w 2 2 3 distribution of the network output the distribution of the output from bnn can be expressed as karmakar and maiti 2019 8a p t x d 1 2 π σ t 2 1 2 exp t y x w mp 2 2 σ t 2 8b σ t 2 1 β g t a 1 g where wmp is the most probable value for the weight vector which corresponds to the maximum of the posterior probability and minimum of s w y x wmp is the mean value of the output σt is the standard deviation of the output a is the hessian matrix of s w g is the gradient of y x w with respect to weight w evaluated at wmp for each input vector x 95 confidence interval ci of the mean network output y x wmp can be estimated by zhang et al 2011 9a y x low y x w mp 1 96 σ t 9b y x up y x w mp 1 96 σ t where y x low is the lower bound of 95 ci y x up is the upper bound of 95 ci 2 2 4 determination of network structure identifying the number of hidden neurons is a key issue for neural network for a network with n input neurons one hidden layer and one output neuron each additional hidden neuron introduces n 2 new weights burden and winkler 2008 in ann a highly complex model would overfit to the training data and thus has poor performance in the validation period in bnn due to the introduction of weight decay item in the objective function too complicated models are penalized as unnecessary weights are driven to zero thus whatever the complexity of the network is overfitting does not occur in bnn through increasing the number of hidden neurons until the performance of calibration no longer improves the network structure can be determined mean squared errors mse between simulated and observed data were used to examine the performances of different models in validation and calibration periods khalili 2018 10 mse 1 n i 1 n is a obs i is a sim i 2 where n is the number of samples isa obs i is the observed isa isa sim i is the simulated isa in this study bnn models with different hidden neurons were trained 50 times to eliminate the spurious effect the performances of the selected ann and bnn models are evaluated by coefficient of correlation r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and mean absolute percentage error mape as follows wang et al 2019 11 r 2 n i 1 n is a obs i is a sim i i 1 n is a obs i i 1 n is a sim i 2 n i 1 n isa obs i 2 i 1 n is a obs i 2 n i 1 n isa sim i 2 i 1 n is a sim i 2 12 nse 1 i 1 n is a obs i is a sim i 2 i 1 n is a obs i is a obs 2 13 mape 1 n i 1 n is a sim i is a obs i is a obs i 100 where is a obs is mean of observed isa the closer r2 and nse values to 1 and the closer mape value to 0 the better the model performance sun et al 2018 generally a model with r2 and nse higher than 0 7 and mape lower than 3 can be considered as reliable zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2019 in addition the kolmogorov smirnov k s test was used for examining the normality of the distribution of errors xu et al 2019 the statistic of k s dks is defined as the maximum difference between the sample cumulative probability and the normal cumulative probability kroll et al 2015 14 d ks max f x s x where f x and s x are the normal and observed cumulative distribution functions evaluated at error x the null hypothesis is that the errors are normally distributed which is accepted at level α if dks dcrit the largest theoretical difference acceptable for the k s test at the significance level α su et al 2017 in this study significance level α was set to be 0 05 thus when the observed significance level p larger than 0 05 the null hypothesis is accepted at 95 confidence level and the errors are considered as normally distributed awange et al 2019 2 3 factorial analysis factorial analysis fa a multivariate inference method can effectively reveal the individual and interactive effects of multiple factors on river runoff through factorial design un et al 2015 an important case of factorial analysis is two level factorial design which is implemented at low l and high h levels for each of k factors leading to 2 k treatment combinations then the sum of squares for individual factor can be calculated by the statistic model as follows montgomery 2012 15 s s a 1 jt i 1 i j 1 j t 1 t y

ssc denote the sums of squares of factors a b and c yijt denotes the system response under the ith level of factor a jth level of factor b and tth level of factor c i j and t denote the numbers of levels of a b and c contribution of each factor to isa can be obtained by calculating the proportion of its sum of squares to the total sum of squares zhang et al 2016 the sum of squares for two factor interaction can be calculated by montgomery 2012 18 s s a b 1 t i 1 i j 1 j t 1 t y ijt 2 1 ijt i 1 i j 1 j t 1 t y ijt 2 s s a s s b 19 s s a c 1 j i 1 i t 1 t j 1 j y ijt 2 1 ijt i 1 i j 1 j

study only six factors with significant main effect on isa were selected for analyzing interactive effect 3 case study the syr darya is one of the two major rivers feeding the aral sea it originates from the pamir and tien shan plateaus running approximately 2500 km across the territories of kyrgyzstan tajikistan uzbekistan and kazakhstan before finally flowing into the aral sea cai et al 2002 since the aral sea separated into two water bodies i e north aral sea and south aral sea in 1987 the syr darya has been flowed into the north aral sea micklin 2016 the annual mean runoff of the syr darya is 14 1 km3 which is mainly formed from glacier and snow melting in the upstream jilili and ma 2015 the area of downstream of the syr darya river basin is about 0 6 106 km2 containing eight districts i e kyzylorda and south kazakhstan in kazakhstan tashkent dzhizak syrdar ya namangan and fergana in uzbekistan and khudzhand in tajikistan as shown in fig 2 the region is dominated by broad desert plains along the river support some vegetations and settlements the region is characterized by temperate continental arid climate with average annual temperature of 14 2 c and precipitation of 60 mm yao and chen 2015 in 2015 the population of the study area was approximately 19 1 million and the urbanization rate was 43 4 cawater 2020 the gross domestic product gdp was 64 5 billion with about 87 3 of the total value being from industry and 12 7 being from agriculture cawater 2020 human have practiced irrigation in the syr darya river basin for at least three millennia however until the 1960s irrigation agriculture did not substantially diminish runoff of the syr darya owing to substantial return flows from irrigated fields and other compensatory factors micklin 2016 since 1960 due to the decision of soviet administration to expand cotton and rice agriculture intensive irrigation system that diverts runoff of the syr darya to cultivated land was developed leading to a sharp decrease of isa aladin et al 2018 shen et al 2018 about 90 of the water withdrawn from the river was used for irrigation cawater 2020 excepted for irrigation agriculture growing municipal and industrial water demands also exacerbated the decrease of isa moreover rainfall evapotranspiration upstream inflow and natural vegetation are important factors causing the variation of isa bocchiola et al 2017 gao et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 quantitatively analyzing the effects of multiple factors on isa is thus crucial for facilitating sustainable water management the geo political context of the syr darya river basin further complicated the regional water resource management during soviet era the uzbek and kazakh soviet socialist republics ssrs in downstream of the syr darya river basin were designated as agricultural production bases with the kyrgyz and tajik ssrs in the upstream designated as water suppliers sorg et al 2014 the cost of water management and the loss of water resources in the upstream of ssrs were subsidized from soviet central funds or compensated by the downstream of ssrs in terms of cheap fuel electricity and food provision kemelova and zhalkubaev 2003 after the disintegration of the soviet union the syr darya became an international river basin covering territories of four newly independent states the riparian states have failed to put forward a feasible regional agreement to replace the soviet subsidized system lee and jung 2018 the downstream countries require more water in summer for their expanding cotton and rice production whereas the upstream countries with little fossil energy are trying to store water in summer and release water in winter for hydropower production sorg et al 2014 the timing problems leave the downstream of the syr darya river basin suffering from water shortage in summer and relatively surplus in winter in this study monthly human activity hydrological and ecological data with a time span of 56 years 1960 2015 are used for simulating isa table 1 presents the considered factors and their data sources these data are divided into two sets data from 1960 to 1991 384 samples for analyzing effects of multiple factors on isa in period of prd and data from 1991 to 2015 288 samples for period of pod for both prd and pod 80 of the total samples are used for calibration and 20 are used for validation these calibration and validation thresholds are widely used in machine learning techniques ticknor 2013 humphrey et al 2016 the calibration and validation sets are assigned randomly 4 result and discussion 4 1 effectiveness of bayesian neural network fig 3 presents the mse of different ann and bnn models mse of ann decreases for calibration and increases for validation when the number of hidden neurons increases from 1 to 15 a highly complex ann model e g the ann model with 15 hidden neurons overfits the training data and thus has poor performance in the validation period however for bnn prd or bnn pod model increasing the number of hidden neurons from 11 or 9 to 15 makes essentially no difference to the mse this is mainly due to the introduction of weight decay item in the objective function too complicated models are penalized as unnecessary weights are driven to zero therefore in this study 11 and 9 hidden neurons were selected for bnn prd and bnn pod models respectively ann models used the same structures for comparison fig 4 a presents r2 nse and mape of the ann models results indicate that ann has a good performance in calibration but poor in validation for example in ann prd model r2 nse and mape of calibration are 0 923 0 923 and 1 96 respectively while those of validation are 0 595 0 468 and 4 48 respectively fig 4a also presents the distribution of errors through dividing them into 15 intervals evenly to further illustrate the model s performance errors in calibration of ann prd randomly and evenly distributed around zero with a mean of 0 00 and a strand deviation sd of 141 67 the p value in the k s test is 0 000 smaller than 0 05 which rejects the null hypothesis that the errors are normally distributed this is mainly because the kurtosis of the errors distribution is higher than the normal distribution curve which further demonstrates the great performance of the ann prd model in calibration phase however in validation the ann prd model has a poor performance as the mean and sd are 55 83 and 394 48 respectively the errors are not normally distributed due to the large sd it could be concluded form the results that even has 11 or 9 hidden neurons the ann models also overfit to the noise of the training data and fail in capturing the intrinsic relationship between input factors and isa fig 4b presents the performances of the bnn models results indicate that bnn performs marginally worse in calibration but much better in validation compared to ann for example r2 nse and mape of bnn prd are 0 814 0 814 and 2 77 in calibration and 0 870 0 846 and 2 47 in validation respectively the mean of errors in validation 37 64 is closer to zero and the sd 199 32 is smaller than those of ann prd this result indicates that bnn can effectively reduce the problem of overfitting which strength the generalization capacity for new data this is mainly because the consideration of parameter uncertainty allows bnn to obtain output through integrating over its posterior probability distribution which avoids the error of single value fig 5 presents the mean network output and its 95 confidence interval for every input vector in calibration and validation phases results indicate that there is a good agreement between simulated and observed isa almost all of the observed values are within the 95 confidence intervals of the mean network outputs in summary the trained bnn models can effectively capture the complex nonlinear relationship between input factors and isa which guarantees the credibility of the subsequent analysis 4 2 main factors affecting isa the effects of 15 factors were investigated based on the factorial analysis technique each factor was designed into two levels low and high corresponding to the 20th and 80th percentiles of all values leading to 215 treatment combinations sun et al 2018 fig 6 presents the distribution and the 20th and 80th percentiles for each factor table 2 shows the serial number of the 215 treatment combinations isa simulation with the trained bnn model was then launched for each of the treatment combinations fig 7 presents the simulated results for prd the highest lowest and average isa of the 215 treatments are 9 20 109 m3 11 10 109 m3 and 0 73 109 m3 respectively for pod the highest lowest and average isa are 0 93 109 m3 0 35 109 m3 and 0 28 109 m3 respectively the large fluctuation range of isa demonstrates the sensitivity of the bnn fa method many negative values for isa are found in fig 7 this is because the combinations of factor levels are constructed artificially to investigate the effects of factors comprehensively the result of factorial design is not a simulation of the real world fig 8 presents main effects of individual factors on isa take the plot of aw u in prd as an example isa decreases from 2 18 109 m3 to 0 73 109 m3 with aw u increasing from its low level of 612 3 106 m3 to high level of 2860 9 106 m3 the slope of the line is negative indicating that aw u has negative effect on isa compared with other factors aw u has the steepest slope implying that aw u has the greatest magnitude of main effect on isa the horizontal line represents the mean value of isa in prd from the results aw k aw t et and rs also have obvious negative effects on isa in period of prd ndvi and ui has slightly positive effects in period of pod factors of aw k aw t aw u and rs still have significant negative effects on isa indicating that irrigated agriculture remains the primary water consumer in the syr darya river basin iw u and et have negative effects on isa and ui has positive effect the slope of ui is larger than that in prd indicating an increasing impact of ui on isa fig 9 a shows the contributions of factors to the variation of isa in period of prd results indicate that aw u is the most significant factor to isa with a contribution of 31 2 followed by aw k 23 8 and aw t 14 3 this is mainly because uzbekistan has the largest area of cultivated land in downstream of the syr darya river basin among the three riparian countries rs is also an important factor whose contribution is 10 6 this is mainly due to the large scale construction of reservoirs in period of prd to promote agricultural irrigation et has a relatively high contribution to isa 7 5 while rf has the smallest 0 1 this is mainly attributed to the arid climate i e high evapotranspiration and low rainfall in the central asia in general human activity factor has the most significant impact on the variation of isa with a total contribution of 88 9 the followings are hydrological and ecological factors with the total contributions being 8 7 and 2 4 respectively among human activities agriculture has the most significant impact on isa with the contribution being 69 3 fig 9b illustrates the contributions of different factors to isa in period of pod aw u remains the most significant factor to isa with a contribution of 21 4 contributions of aw k and aw t are 16 0 and 14 2 respectively contribution of iw u increases slightly from 4 8 to 9 4 due to the development of industry in uzbekistan the largest difference occurs in factor of ui whose contribution increases from 1 1 in prd to 19 1 in pod this is mainly because the disintegration of the soviet union and the consequent dispute between the upstream countries and downstream countries the timing problems leave the study area downstream of the syr darya river basin suffering from water shortage in summer and relatively surplus in winter which increases the impact of ui on isa in pod human activity remains the most significant factor to isa with a total contribution of 72 8 the followings are hydrological and ecological factors with the total contributions being 23 4 and 3 8 respectively agricultural water consumption has the most significant impact on isa with the contribution being 51 6 4 3 interactive effects of multiple factors on isa six significant factors were selected for the analysis of interactive effects on isa table 3 shows sum of squares for two factor interaction results indicate that in prd interactions among agricultural water consumptions of the three countries i e aw k aw t aw k aw u and aw t aw u and interactions between et and agricultural water consumptions i e et aw k et aw t and et aw u have important effects on isa aw t aw k has the most significant interaction with the sum of squares being 12 4 1015 in pod interactions among agricultural water consumptions of the three countries interactions between ui and agricultural water consumptions i e aw k ui aw t ui aw u ui and interaction between aw u and iw u have noticeable effects on isa aw u ui has the largest interactive effect with the sum of squares being 20 7 1012 fig 10 presents the matrix of interaction plots in prd which further illustrates the specific manners of the interactions between different factors note that the interaction plot of aw k aw t row 1 column 1 when aw t is at low level aw k has a slight negative effect on isa 1 3 109 m3 when aw t is at high level aw k has a significant negative effect 3 8 109 m3 the impact of aw t on aw k can be measured by the gap between the two effects 2 5 109 m3 from the results the impact of aw u on aw k is 2 1 109 m3 and the impact of aw u on aw t is 1 9 109 m3 this is mainly because when the agricultural water consumption of one country is at high level the resource competition will increase the sensitivity of isa to another countries agricultural water consumption the results imply the importance for simultaneously optimizing the agricultural water consumptions of kazakhstan uzbekistan and tajikistan moreover the effects of aw k aw t and aw u depend on the level of et in detail the negative effects of aw k aw t and aw u on isa increase 1 9 109 m3 1 7 109 m3 and 1 7 109 m3 respectively when et varies from its low level to high level this is mainly because high level evapotranspiration means less water resource available for irrigated agriculture which increases the sensitivity of isa to agricultural water consumption fig 11 presents the matrix of interaction plots in pod results indicate that interactions still exist in aw k aw t aw k aw u and aw t aw u with the impacts being 61 106 m3 93 106 m3 and 91 106 m3 respectively in addition interactions between ui and agricultural water consumptions have noticeable effects on isa when ui is at low level aw k aw t and aw u have obvious negative effects on isa 145 106 m3 135 106 m3 and 170 106 m3 respectively when ui is at high level these effects reduce to 64 106 m3 61 106 m3 and 70 106 m3 respectively this is mainly because high level upstream inflow relieves the water stress in downstream of the syr darya river basin results also indicate that the effect of aw u depends on the level of iw u the negative effect of aw u on isa decreases by 74 106 m3 when ui varies from its low level to high level this indicates that development of industry in uzbekistan can reduce the effect of agriculture on isa 4 4 sensitivity of bnn fa to non agricultural factors through the proposed bnn fa method agricultural water consumption was identified to be the dominated factor that affects the water resource in the syr darya river basin which is in accordance with previous scientific literatures beek et al 2011 lee and jung 2018 in fact the bnn fa method is also sensitive to the other non agricultural factors with factors aw k aw t and aw u being at their high level and keeping unchanged the factorial design for the other 12 factors can be obtained fig 12 presents the simulated isa under 212 combinations of non agricultural factor levels for prd the lowest and highest isa are 11 10 109 m3 and 2 55 109 m3 respectively the fluctuation range is 13 65 109 m3 which occupies 67 2 of the fluctuation range in the complete 215 factorial design as shown in fig 7 for pod the lowest and highest isa are 0 35 109 m3 and 0 57 109 m3 respectively the fluctuation range of the 212 factorial design is 0 92 109 m3 occupying 71 9 of the complete factorial design the results indicate that bnn fa can give enough responses to the variations of non agricultural factors which demonstrates its sensitivity in determining the contributions of all factors it can be concluded that the bnn fa method is also applicable for the other case studies where the influence of one factor is not so evident 5 conclusions in this study a bayesian neural network based factorial analysis bnn fa method has been developed for quantitatively analyzing effects of multiple factors on isa through integrating techniques of bayesian neural network bnn and factorial analysis fa into a general framework the bnn fa method has been proved to be effective in i reflecting the complex nonlinear relationship between input factors and river runoff ii assessing parameter uncertainty with bayesian inference to reduce the overfitting problem and iii revealing the individual and interactive effects of multiple factors on river runoff then the bnn fa method has been applied to the downstream of the syr darya river basin where effects of human activity hydrological and ecological factors have been analyzed results indicate that i in period of prd the major factors affecting isa are aw u 31 2 aw k 23 8 aw t 14 3 rs 10 6 et 7 5 interactions among agricultural water consumptions of the three countries and interactions between et and agricultural water consumptions have noticeable effects on isa ii in period of pod the major factors are aw u 21 4 ui 19 0 aw k 16 0 aw t 14 2 iw u 9 4 interactions among agricultural water consumptions of the three countries and interactions between ui and agricultural water consumptions have important effects on isa iii the contribution of agricultural activity has a decreased trend from 69 3 in prd to 51 6 in pod iv due to the disintegration of the soviet union and the consequent international dispute the contribution of ui increases obviously from 1 1 in prd to 19 1 in pod the findings are helpful for decision makers to formulate effective strategies to increase the runoff of the syr darya and restore the eco environment of the aral sea although the proposed bnn fa method has proven to be effective in quantitatively analyzing effects of multiple factors on isa some limitations exist in this study bnn fa is actually a system theoretical model that cannot characterize the physical mechanism of hydrological process thus conceptual or physically based hydrological models are desired to be incorporated into bnn fa to reveal the internal hydrological sub process of the syr darya river basin only 15 factors associated with human activity hydrological process and ecosystem were investigated in this study some other factors such as water management measure agricultural policy land use change population temperature and groundwater level could also affect isa more factors should be considered in future studies to obtain a more accurate simulation two level factorial analysis was used in the bnn fa method which can hardly reflect the nonlinear response of river runoff to variation of factor levels factorial analysis with three or more factor levels is desired in future research in addition this study only identified the major factors for the variation of isa based on the last decades data forecasting of isa should be conducted in the future to explore the specific measures to increase the runoff of the syr darya and restore the eco environment of the aral sea declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

5433,karst springs constitute an important water resource their aquatic environment however is susceptible to degradation due to the presence of karst conduit that can deliver pollutants rapidly to the groundwater this investigation is a case study of a spring fed pool that is affected by a river hydrological hydrochemical and biological approaches were used to reveal the characteristics and consequences of the interaction between the groundwater of karst springs and the surface water during the rainy seasons the river backflow effect causes the spring fed pool to form a hyporheic zone that is sensitive to hydrological and hydrochemical processes under forward flow conditions the physicochemical parameters of groundwater at the spring fed pool exhibited gradient variations in longitudinal flow direction and changed with depth the threshold value of river backflow into the pool is 99 m masl in 2017 the water level of the pool ranged from 96 to 100 m during the high flow period which was 1 to 5 m higher than those in the low flow period one to several times a year of river backflow ultimately leads to the death of submerged plants at the spring fed pool followed by phytoplankton blooms chlorophyll a chl a concentration of groundwater was 16 times higher in regions with the slow flow than in those with the quick flow and chl a concentration was higher in the bottom layer than in the surface layer e coli in groundwater was affected by the hyporheic zone and downstream rivers and e coli counts were associated with hydrodynamic conditions due to the reduced upstream discharge and the increased amount of water consumption the frequency and intensity of river backflow increase leading to a weakening of the hydrological and biological functions in the hyporheic zone the presence of the hyporheic zone makes possible the transport of pollutants microorganisms and plankton to upstream springs via the reverse flow of downstream rivers we recommend that the effects of hyporheic zones be considered when classifying sanitary protection zones in the karst water system keywords karst spring hyporheic zone river backflow e coli drinking water source 1 introduction streams in karst areas may disappear by converting to underground rivers through sinkholes and then being discharged by karst springs several kilometers away converging into higher order rivers this phenomenon causes the frequent conversion of surface water and groundwater in karst regions the relationships between rivers and groundwater become closer and variable in karst regions bonacci 2015 during low flow periods groundwater is discharged from spring outlets and flows to rivers during high flow periods river water levels rapidly rise after heavy rains and rivers flow back into the spring outlet or even enter the aquifer through karst conduits causing spring or even aquifer pollution the interaction of groundwater and surface water not only affects hydrological processes but also the migration of pollutants and organisms understanding the degree and range of the groundwater surface water interface gwswi is challenging however as there are many influencing factors conant et al 2019 groundwater surface water interactions can mutually affect the hydrological processes water quality and the health of ecosystems environment agency 2009a krause et al 2017 the transition zone where groundwater and surface water mixing has been defined as hyporheic zone white 1993 more specifically river hyporheic zones that are at the conversion interface between groundwater and surface water spatially refer to water saturated regions located in the downstream section of rivers that extend to the riparian zones on both sides of the rivers boulton et al 1998 yuan and luo 2003 dahm et al 2007 the hyporheic zone is a space in which multiple phases solid liquid gas and biological co exist it is an area that possesses dynamic spatiotemporal variation characteristics and performs active hydrological geochemical and biological functions triska et al 1989 the hyporheic zone can significantly promote pollutant degradation and stimulate changes in the aquatic environment and aquatic ecology brunke and gonser 1997 fox and durnford 2003 however researchers have different interpretations as to the actual extent of hyporheic zone based on their discipline background agency 2009 in addition to hydrochemical indices research on the aquatic environment of hyporheic zones also focuses on biological effects plankton is an indicator organism for water quality change singh et al 2013 plankton can be used to measure the primary productivity and degree of eutrophication of water bodies all phytoplankton contains chlorophyll a chl a therefore chl a concentration is generally used to characterize phytoplankton biomass boyer et al 2009 some studies have indicated that chl a can be used to reveal the relationship between karst water systems and rivers since chl a is absent in groundwater under natural conditions gaillard et al 2020 bacterial and viral counts are also important indicators of groundwater quantity fecal pollution of spring waters is typically determined via fecal indicator organisms such as e coli knierim et al 2015 the study of sinreich et al 2014 concluded that e coli is an adequate indicator for the arrival of bacterial pathogens viruses and protozoa at karst springs the world health organization requires that e coli or fecal coliforms should not be detected in any 100 ml water sample from the perspective of groundwater and surface water interaction this effect is more significant and special in karst areas in karst regions the scope of a hyporheic zone is not limited to the mixed region formed from groundwater recharged by riverbed deposits but may extend to aquifers along the karst conduit or expand towards the deep karst and the regions between rivers when the backflow of river occurs during rainy seasons a unique karst hyporheic zone is formed at the spring fed pool although the concept of karst hyporheic zone was proposed in 2013 it focused only on the areas where the karst groundwater and the surrounding karst matrix water are actively alternating wilson 2013 research on hyporheic zone where karst water and surface water interact was seldom reported especially in water systems where conduit flows are dominated in addition there is a lack of knowledge on ecological and aquatic environmental effects caused by karst hyporheic zones karst spring outlets are usually important sources of drinking water many countries have formulated regulations for delineating sanitary protection zones based on the hydrological and geological conditions as well as the fragility of karst aquifers for instance germany has stipulated that the first zone immediate zone for wells in karst aquifers is within a 30 m upstream radius the corresponding values are 20 m for slovenia and 100 m for turkey živanović 2015 china stipulates that the classification of the first zone in a peak cluster depression conduit type water source can refer to the methods of surface river water source i e the upstream extent of the water source should not be less than 1000 m and the downstream should not be less than 100 m ministry of environment protection 2018 when a riverside karst spring is used as a water source it may be affected by the interaction between surface water and groundwater existing delineation method however does not consider the effects of hyporheic zones therefore whether or not this type of sanitary protection zone can truly play a conservation role is a question that deserves discussion the goal of this study was to investigate the hydrological and ecological processes of hyporheic zone at a karst spring fed pool that is affected by river backflow to discuss the appropriate indicators of aquatic environment and the variation mechanisms of it in the hyporheic zone then the effect of the environmental function of hyporheic zones on the delineation of sanitary protection zones at the spring fed pool was examined this research also broadens the definition of the hyporheic zone that consists primarily of karst conduit flows 2 overview of the study area the total area of the wuming basin which is located in the central guangxi region of china is 4536 km2 of which the area of the karst region is 3176 km2 this region is an important fruit production base in south china the annual rainfall of the wuming basin is 1247 mm and the mean annual temperature is 21 9 c the basin has abundant karst groundwater and 148 groundwater subsystems have been recorded of which lingshui is the largest with a drainage basin of 693 km2 jiang and guo 2012 sandong and dongfeng are the largest springs in the lingshui catchment area in addition luobotan and qinzhu are large springs in the basin fig 1 the wuming river and its primary tributaries the xi river and the xiangshan river are major surface rivers in the basin groundwater discharge is controlled by local river erosion of the datum plane and is mainly discharged through springs in the basin 70 of spring water is exposed in the riverbed or riparian zone and spring outlets form pools with large water body areas this environment provides conditions for river backflow into pool lingshui is a small lake pool formed from the concentrated discharge of 9 springs outlets s1 s9 s2 is the largest spring in the lingshui spring group and it is the main centralized drainage outlet of the aquifer the outlet of s2 is characterized by an l shaped karst conduit with a measured depth of 10 m s1 is the second big spring in addition the rest of the springs are submerged after discharge a pool with an area of 29 300 m2 is formed and the pool converges into the wuming river after flowing for 40 m lingshui is the only water source for 130 000 people in the city and s2 and s1 are outlets from which water is collected with pump volumes of 0 8 and 0 4 m3 s respectively currently during the low flow period the discharge of the lingshui spring group is 1 4 4 m3 s in most time of one hydrological cycle groundwater flows to wuming river after it discharges from the aquifer in the form of a spring group during heavy rains however the river flows back into the pool occasionally under this circumstance groundwater and surface water interacts here even the interaction is not processing all the time the sediment and nutrients matter carrying by surface water will deposit in the pool or even some organisms may stay and reproduce the effect of interaction is continuous and permanent therefore the spring fed pool is undoubtedly a unique hyporheic zone every year river backflow causes the turbidity of lingshui to exceed standards resulting in interruptions to the tap water supply this has resulted in persistent destruction to the ecological environment at the pool from 2010 to 2013 lingshui pool experienced a gradual loss in submerged plants and there are now no submerged plants from 2016 to the present e coli counts have exceeded standards there have been large numbers of tilapia and large amounts of fish feces have floated on the water surface or have been submerged at the bottom of the pool from 2017 to the present the local government has used metal wires to delineate a region with s2 as its center to 50 m in the pool as a sanitary protection red line rl in order to protect the lingshui water source in 2018 a 100 m long and 25 m wide pontoon swimming pool psp was constructed 30 m downstream of the red line 3 methods the largest spring lingshui in the wuming basin was selected and a detailed study of the hydrological dynamics of the groundwater groundwater surface water relationship and aquatic environment indicators was conducted since lingshui has a large area the study site needs to be divided into several sub regions the wuming river flows back into lingshui pool forming a mixed area of groundwater and surface water which is part of the estuary hyporheic zone the interaction range of groundwater and surface water in the hyporheic zone varies with hydrodynamic conditions the farthest boundary of the hyporheic zone reaches the depth of 5 m underwater at s2 outlet because of backflow of river water sediment deposits in the hyporheic zone previous studies have found that the content of organic carbon and carbon isotopes in sediments can be used to determine areas where groundwater and surface water are strongly mixed guo et al 2016 during the interaction process water temperature water chemistry and turbidity can also be used to determine the scope of the interaction the hyporheic zone in this study refers to the area from 100 m downstream of s2 to the end of the pool therefore groundwater outlets of s2 and s1 and their surrounding area can be classified as the groundwater zone gw while the convergence between the wuming river and lingshui represents the surface water zone sw meanwhile the region between the gw and sw is the groundwater surface water hyporheic zone hz fig 2 groundwater flowing into the river was defined as forward flow while river backflow into lingshui pool was defined as reverse flow 3 1 physical chemical parameters and water level monitoring in 2015 a monitoring station ms was built at

hydrological instrument co ltd was used to measure the velocity of groundwater at the cross section of the hz every 3 months the discharge of lingshui spring group then was calculated based on the cross sectional area and flow velocity 3 3 water samples analysis and aquatic environmental survey seven profiles were situated in lingshui pool from the gw to the hz with 3 or 4 points placed at

according to the standard methods of monitoring analysis for water another 0 5 l volume of water samples was filtered through a 0 45 μm fibrous membrane freeze thawed repeatedly and used for determining the chlorophyll a chl a content by acetone extraction from 2018 to 2019 chl a was measured quarterly in situ by using an algae wader pro with a precision of 0 01 μg l from 23 may to 15 august 2019 multiple sampling points were set along the flow direction from the gw to the sw in lingshui pool in order to analyze the e coli concentration at the 2 sampling timepoints the discharge

pool in a hydrological cycle groundwater flows towards the river in most of the time and forward flow occurs in the hyporheic zone during heavy rains however the river water level rises faster than the groundwater resulting in reverse flow when reverse flow occurs the water level of the hyporheic zone increases rapidly in 2017 rainfall was concentrated from may to september accounting for 70 of the annual rainfall during the low flow period the water level at the cross section of the monitoring station was 2 3 m during the high flow period the water level fluctuated due to frequent rainfall reaching a maximum of 7 3 m during the 10 year observation period through 2010 to 2019 the highest water level was 12 m the overall variations in ph t and sec were low at the interannual scale during the low flow period ph t and sec all exhibited diurnal nocturnal variations which were not significantly related to rainfall during the high flow period ph t and sec still remained constant and were inconsistent with rainfall occurrence or intensity fig 3 even though a portion of the 2017 high flow period data was missing because the apparatus was relocated in order to avoid flooding this phenomenon was observed repeatedly in other years in the gw zone groundwater flows out along several fractures in the bedrock with fast groundwater renewal the hydraulic condition at the s2 outlet was strong and the flow velocity was 0 05 0 23 m s in the hz the groundwater flow velocity was 0 03 0 2 m s fig 4 the cross sectional flow velocity measurements in the hz revealed that the water level was approximately 0 5 2 m and the flow velocity was 0 03 0 1 m s during the low flow period meanwhile the water level rose to 1 5 2 5 m and the flow velocity increased to 0 1 0 22 m s during the high flow period during the observed heavy rain events the cross sectional water level increased to 3 5 m due to the effects of river backwater or backflow but the groundwater flow velocity was only 0 01 0 1 m s 4 2 physical chemistry characteristics of groundwater in the spring pool system the ph t sec and do in lingshui pool showed gradual difference between the gw and the sw forward direction of water taking the physicochemical parameters at the bottom layer 2 m of the pool as an example the water temperature was 24 24 5 c near the gw and increased slightly during downstream discharge the ph in the vicinity of the gw ranged from 7 32 to 7 34 and increased in the downstream direction to 7 35 7 37 s7 is connected with s9 spring through karst conduit and it had the highest ph similarly do was the lowest in the gw region and gradually increased in the downstream direction sec did not exhibit a pattern similar to the other parameters sec was the highest at outlets s2 and s8 ranging from approximately 375 383 μs cm and it had lowest value at s7 350 360 μs cm fig 5 the mean values of the physiochemical parameters in the 3 regions were calculated in the longitudinal flow direction table 1 ph t and do increased from the gw zone to the sw zone the turbidity so4 2 and po4 3 in the sw zone were higher than those in the gw and hz although the depth of lingshui pool only ranges from approximately 1 3 m the physical chemical parameters of the water still exhibited some vertical gradients fig 6 t in all sites began to decrease at 0 2 m below the water surface the water temperature continuously decreased at a depth below 0 2 m in the gw zone while it began to keep stable below 0 5 m in the hz zone in the gw zone ph remained constant above 1 m and began to fall below 1 m in the hz zone ph decreased with depth especially where it closed to the sw zone the changes in sec were even more significant in general sec increased with depth except in regions with significant human disturbance in the pool c1 and c4 but when it closed to the sw the sec showed irregular changes the do decreased with depth in the gw but remained constant in the hz 4 3 chl a in early 2016 2017 at the start of the complete degeneration of the submerged plants the concentration range of chl a in lingshui pool was only 0 60 1 48 μg l in 2018 2019 the chl a concentration rapidly increased in spring season the chl a concentration values of s1 and s2 were 0 609 and 0 873 μg l respectively fig 7 in the center of the pool the variation ranges of the chl a concentration in the surface and bottom layers were 0 673 1 151 μg l and 0 940 4 288 μg l respectively in the swimming pool and its surroundings the chl a content significantly increased ranging from 0 808 to 1 149 μg l and 1 134 7 957 μg l in the surface and bottom layers respectively in winter season the overall chl a concentration significantly increased the mean chl a concentrations were 6 637 3 375 and 1 581 μg l in the surface layer of s1 the center of the pool and the swimming pool respectively in the bottom layer the variation range of the chl a concentration near s1 was greater ranging from 2 905 to 14 338 μg l with a mean value of 7 901 μg l in the center of the pool the variation range of the chl a was 10 053 13 374 μg l and the mean was 11 959 μg l in the swimming pool the variation range of the chl a concentration was 1 320 3 926 μg l and the mean was 2 899 μg l in the hyporheic zone of the pool the spatial and temporal variations of water temperature were very low and the chl a was not controlled by either t or ph the results of water samples collected at june 25 2015 showed the nitrogen and phosphorus contents were low and did not have a significant relationship with chl a sd and chl a exhibited a significant correlation table 2 4 4 fecal bacteria before 2010 e coli was seldom detected in the s2 spring from 2011 to 2016 although e coli was sometimes not detected counts of 9 240 cfu 100 ml were measured when e coli was detected fig 8 during both low flow and high flow periods e coli was not detected in s2 e coli was not detected in s1 during the low flow period but detected at a level of 520 cfu 100 ml during the rainy season overall the e coli counts within the red line ranged from 0 to 180 cfu 100 ml and ranged from 260 to 1080 cfu 100 ml outside the red line during the low flow period fig 9 the closer to sw zone the higher of e coli counts and it reached a peak of 1560 cfu 100 ml at the spring river convergence during the high flow period e coli was detected in all sites except s2 the e coli counts within the sanitary protection red line ranged from 0 to 1300 cfu 100 ml and were 60 cfu 100 ml outside the red line overall e coli counts were higher during the high flow period than during the low flow period within the red line 5 discussion 5 1 the influence of groundwater decline and river backflow on the hyporheic zone in the 1970 s the discharge of lingshui was 4 000 l s during low flow period continuous measurements from 2010 found the discharge of lingshui was 1 400 4 000 l s in dry seasons mostly about 2000 l s compared to the 1970 s the discharge of lingshui spring group during the low flow period in this stage has decreased by 12 5 50 among them the reduction of s2 was the greatest its proportion dropped from 23 of the total discharge in the 1980 s to 12 in this stage most of the springs in the basin were in similar conditions owing to a combination effect of land use change increasing pumping and changes in the precipitation regimes guo et al 2015 in contrast water demand has been increasing year by year in 2017 the volume of water collected from the lingshui spring was 24 times that of 1978 reaching 29 41 million m3 the decrease in spring discharge is also the main factor leading to changes in water quality in addition the increase in human activities and the increase in contamination load are also the reasons for the deterioration of water quality they weaken the self purification ability of the groundwater environment therefore hydrological functions the ability of hydrological exchange environment agency 2005 boulton et al 1998 that is physical effects such as dilution mixing scouring and sedimentation by hydrodynamics and hydrochemical functions the ability to promote the degradation the transformation of pollutants and the ability of exchange flow to provide nutrients to aquatic organisms agency 2009 boulton et al 1998 in the hyporheic zone are weakened the backflow of rivers into spring outlets or aquifers is a common phenomenon in karst areas in south china as mentioned earlier river backflow occurs once or several times a year in lingshui according to manual field observation river backflow will occur when the water level exceeds 99 m masl based on the hydrographs 4 times of river backflow events could be delineated in 2017 the duration time of the water level exceeded the threshold value for these events ranged from 7 to 46 h although the water levels dropped below 99 m afterward the influence of backflow still continued for some time backflow from rivers is a big threat to groundwater quality because water quality of the river is often worse than groundwater for example compared to the two samples taken on february 19 2009 and may 13 2015 it was found that the concentration of po4 3 in wuming river was 50 times that of lingshui the river water is poured back into the spring outlet or even aquifer which not only increase temporary turbidity but may also change the physical chemical properties and biological characteristics of groundwater albéric 2004 suspended particles brought by the river will reduce the water transparency of the hyporheic zone thereby reducing the photosynthesis of submerged plants organic matter decomposes subsequently this process consumes a large amount of oxygen making the water environment transit to a reducing environment these processes affect not only the water quality of water bodies but also the healthy growth of aquatic ecosystems due to the decrease in the flow of lingshui and the weakening of hydrodynamic conditions the possibility of river backflow increases observations found the river backflow events were 0 to 2 times in 2011 2014 while it was 4 times in 2017 indicating that the frequency of wuming river s flowing back into lingshui has increased we also found the duration of the backflow has become longer the consequence of backflow lasted from 1 to 3 days in 2011 2014 to 3 5 days in 2017 increasing frequency and duration of river backflow had a pronounced impact on the water environment of lingshui spring and even the entire aquifer guo et al 2019 5 2 causes of aquatic environment changes in the spring fed pool the above mentioned data revealed that groundwater discharges from spring and converges with the river during this process the water quality changes gradually a transition zone clearly exists between springs and rivers which is created from the interaction of groundwater and surface water the causes of the associated aquatic environment changes can be examined from multiple perspectives firstly these processes can be explored in terms of the river backflow effects during the low flow period and under forward flow the effects of the river aquatic environment on spring outlets are little when the reverse flow occurs the aquatic environment of the spring fed pool will be affected by the river the effects of river backwater on the hydraulic behavior at lingshui spring are reflected in 2 evidences 1 during the high flow period no corresponding relationship was found between water level of the pool and discharge in lingshui and the water level t and hydrochemistry sec changes were slight and asynchronous the changes in spring discharge reflect rainfall recharge within the catchment area and the groundwater runoff patterns in the system since the lingshui system is a large syncline aquifer characterized by karstic fractures network the hydrological dynamic is not sensitive to rainfall in contrast water level changes are mostly affected by river water levels river backflow causes changes in water quality in the pool resulting in water quality stratification groundwater is located in the bottom layer while river water is in the top layer since the online water quality monitor was installed at the bottom layer of the pool it was not affected by river water 2 the cross sectional flow velocity was inconsistent with water level flow velocity did not increase with water level during the extremely high water level period indicating that the increase in water level was caused by river backflow rather than the increase of karst spring discharge secondly the causes of the aquatic environment changes can be examined in terms of human activities the anthropogenic effects on the aquatic environment are measured from 2 perspectives 1 on a ten year scale it was proved that the contamination load experienced by the lingshui karst system exhibited an increasing trend from the 1970 s to 2019 nitrate content of s2 changed from nearly 0 to 10 mg l guo et al 2015 2 the pollutant of the pool had several different sources and migration pathways the codmn values of s2 and s1 were 4 23 and 11 2 mg l respectively with an average value of 7 19 mg l in the pool meanwhile a comparison of the e coli distribution showed that e coli could be detected at s1 in the high and low flow periods demonstrating that the effects of domestic pollutants on lingshui pool occur primarily through the s1 outlet thirdly the explanation of the aquatic environment changes can be investigated in terms of local environmental differences at the pool the hydrochemistry of karst spring is controlled by the lithology of carbonate rock and appears to be a simple and stable water type however it may undergo changes once the water has converged at the pool in that case abiotic factors depth sediment thickness and nature and substrate features can all affect hydrochemical characters grabowska et al 2014 biotic factors such as aquatic flora and fauna will drastically change the hydrochemical environment some submerged plants can decrease the turbidity of a water body and increase dissolved oxygen levels kosten et al 2009 lingshui karst spring pool underwent the stages of 1 vigorous submerged plants 2 dying out of submerged plants 3 phytoplankton proliferation 4 invasion of alien species tilapia and fish manure could not decompose in time and 5 e coli pollution resulting in a weakening of the biological function in the hyporheic zone and rapid changes of the local environment in the pool evidently although the water quality of lingshui spring keeps in good status from the view of inorganic hydrochemistry evaluation it is at the transition period from a macrophytic to an algal environment therefore the combination of hydrochemistry chl a and microorganisms represented by e coli more accurately reflects the status of the aquatic environment when a karst groundwater system is influenced by groundwater surface water interaction an ecosystem prospection including the physicochemical approaches of water plankton biomass and microorganisms should be better for identifying the environmental quality 5 3 strategy of sanitary protection zones in hyporheic zone the delineation of sanitary protection zones usually uses water intake sites as centers and semi circles with different radii superimposed on the upstream region as boundaries for various classes of protection zones based on the migration times of pollutants to the water intake site changes in the aquatic environment at the hyporheic zones reveal that major physicochemical parameters of water are indicators of the overall environmental quality of aquifers and reflect the internal and upstream effects of aquifers even though there are differences in water quality at different sites in the aquifer the mixing is completely after convergence in the spring fed pool during heavy rains river backflow into the pool occurs and the hydrochemistry will exhibit transient but significant gradients in this study concentrations of chl a which is an indicator of phytoplankton biomass were found to be high reflecting a deterioration of the ecosystem in the pool due to the effects of changeable hydraulic conditions in pool water the spatial distribution of chl a was variable e coli is a pathogenic microbe and is an indicator of health risk in drinking water even though the s1 and s2 are two karst springs closed to each other from the same aquifer e coli was seldom detected in s2 but frequently found in s1 indicating that e coli does not originate from the aquifer but rather from closely domestic pollutants around the pool during the high flow period e coli is often detected at the s1 spring signifying that pollutants are flushed into the pool mainly from the s1 pathway the higher e coli counts in the hz and sw suggest that swimming may be another major source of e coli before 2017 residents were allowed to swim anywhere in the pool now however swimming in the pool is forbidden since e coli levels exceed the standards in 2018 a pontoon swimming pool psp was built in the hz and then people began to swim in or around the psp the integrated analysis revealed that e coli may find a way to across the protection red line rl and migrate to upstream or enter the gw zone or even enter the pumping site s2 and inner aquifer through karst conduits that s why e coli can be detected occasionally in s2 spring therefore the governmental stipulation of a 50 m radius upstream of the water intake site as an immediate sanitary protection zone i may not provide protective effects completely the delineation of protection red line in the spring fed pool should consider the effects of hyporheic zones and then i zone should be expanded downstream of the water intake site the distance depends on the extent of hyporheic zone iʹ fig 10 6 conclusions karst springs emerged at river bank are sensitive on hydrological and ecological processes to environmental disturbance under the condition of forward flow ph t and do showed gradient changes in the direction of karst spring pool river under the influence of reverse flow the water level change of the pool was not synchronized with the water chemistry and the water body became stratified river backflow causes the spring fed pool to experience transient but strong groundwater surface water interaction due to the combined effects of facts such as land use change increased groundwater abstraction and climate change in the basin discharge in lingshui decreased significantly in dry seasons the hydraulic balance between groundwater and river has been broken and then the frequency and duration of river backflow have a trend of increase the changes weaken the hydrological and hydrochemical functions of the hyporheic zone after degeneration of submerged plants in the hyporheic zone phytoplankton rapidly blooms showing an increase in chl a it was also found that the spatial distribution of chl a was related to hydrodynamic conditions e coli could often be detected in the pool but there were differences in space and time e coli was mainly derived from the surrounding domestic sewage however when the slow flow was dominated in the pool e coli might also migrate from the river or the hyporheic zone to the upstream aquifer threatening the drinking water safety the aquatic environment of the spring fed pool is jointly affected by hydrological conditions the local environment and the intensity of human disturbance as a result the aquatic environment protection of the karst spring fed pool will not only be limited to the karst groundwater drainage basin but also extend to the rivers outside the basin our results showed the existing immediate sanitary protection zone might not provide complete protective effect it is recommended that the delineation of protection zones in a spring fed pool should consider the effects of hyporheic zone

5433,karst springs constitute an important water resource their aquatic environment however is susceptible to degradation due to the presence of karst conduit that can deliver pollutants rapidly to the groundwater this investigation is a case study of a spring fed pool that is affected by a river hydrological hydrochemical and biological approaches were used to reveal the characteristics and consequences of the interaction between the groundwater of karst springs and the surface water during the rainy seasons the river backflow effect causes the spring fed pool to form a hyporheic zone that is sensitive to hydrological and hydrochemical processes under forward flow conditions the physicochemical parameters of groundwater at the spring fed pool exhibited gradient variations in longitudinal flow direction and changed with depth the threshold value of river backflow into the pool is 99 m masl in 2017 the water level of the pool ranged from 96 to 100 m during the high flow period which was 1 to 5 m higher than those in the low flow period one to several times a year of river backflow ultimately leads to the death of submerged plants at the spring fed pool followed by phytoplankton blooms chlorophyll a chl a concentration of groundwater was 16 times higher in regions with the slow flow than in those with the quick flow and chl a concentration was higher in the bottom layer than in the surface layer e coli in groundwater was affected by the hyporheic zone and downstream rivers and e coli counts were associated with hydrodynamic conditions due to the reduced upstream discharge and the increased amount of water consumption the frequency and intensity of river backflow increase leading to a weakening of the hydrological and biological functions in the hyporheic zone the presence of the hyporheic zone makes possible the transport of pollutants microorganisms and plankton to upstream springs via the reverse flow of downstream rivers we recommend that the effects of hyporheic zones be considered when classifying sanitary protection zones in the karst water system keywords karst spring hyporheic zone river backflow e coli drinking water source 1 introduction streams in karst areas may disappear by converting to underground rivers through sinkholes and then being discharged by karst springs several kilometers away converging into higher order rivers this phenomenon causes the frequent conversion of surface water and groundwater in karst regions the relationships between rivers and groundwater become closer and variable in karst regions bonacci 2015 during low flow periods groundwater is discharged from spring outlets and flows to rivers during high flow periods river water levels rapidly rise after heavy rains and rivers flow back into the spring outlet or even enter the aquifer through karst conduits causing spring or even aquifer pollution the interaction of groundwater and surface water not only affects hydrological processes but also the migration of pollutants and organisms understanding the degree and range of the groundwater surface water interface gwswi is challenging however as there are many influencing factors conant et al 2019 groundwater surface water interactions can mutually affect the hydrological processes water quality and the health of ecosystems environment agency 2009a krause et al 2017 the transition zone where groundwater and surface water mixing has been defined as hyporheic zone white 1993 more specifically river hyporheic zones that are at the conversion interface between groundwater and surface water spatially refer to water saturated regions located in the downstream section of rivers that extend to the riparian zones on both sides of the rivers boulton et al 1998 yuan and luo 2003 dahm et al 2007 the hyporheic zone is a space in which multiple phases solid liquid gas and biological co exist it is an area that possesses dynamic spatiotemporal variation characteristics and performs active hydrological geochemical and biological functions triska et al 1989 the hyporheic zone can significantly promote pollutant degradation and stimulate changes in the aquatic environment and aquatic ecology brunke and gonser 1997 fox and durnford 2003 however researchers have different interpretations as to the actual extent of hyporheic zone based on their discipline background agency 2009 in addition to hydrochemical indices research on the aquatic environment of hyporheic zones also focuses on biological effects plankton is an indicator organism for water quality change singh et al 2013 plankton can be used to measure the primary productivity and degree of eutrophication of water bodies all phytoplankton contains chlorophyll a chl a therefore chl a concentration is generally used to characterize phytoplankton biomass boyer et al 2009 some studies have indicated that chl a can be used to reveal the relationship between karst water systems and rivers since chl a is absent in groundwater under natural conditions gaillard et al 2020 bacterial and viral counts are also important indicators of groundwater quantity fecal pollution of spring waters is typically determined via fecal indicator organisms such as e coli knierim et al 2015 the study of sinreich et al 2014 concluded that e coli is an adequate indicator for the arrival of bacterial pathogens viruses and protozoa at karst springs the world health organization requires that e coli or fecal coliforms should not be detected in any 100 ml water sample from the perspective of groundwater and surface water interaction this effect is more significant and special in karst areas in karst regions the scope of a hyporheic zone is not limited to the mixed region formed from groundwater recharged by riverbed deposits but may extend to aquifers along the karst conduit or expand towards the deep karst and the regions between rivers when the backflow of river occurs during rainy seasons a unique karst hyporheic zone is formed at the spring fed pool although the concept of karst hyporheic zone was proposed in 2013 it focused only on the areas where the karst groundwater and the surrounding karst matrix water are actively alternating wilson 2013 research on hyporheic zone where karst water and surface water interact was seldom reported especially in water systems where conduit flows are dominated in addition there is a lack of knowledge on ecological and aquatic environmental effects caused by karst hyporheic zones karst spring outlets are usually important sources of drinking water many countries have formulated regulations for delineating sanitary protection zones based on the hydrological and geological conditions as well as the fragility of karst aquifers for instance germany has stipulated that the first zone immediate zone for wells in karst aquifers is within a 30 m upstream radius the corresponding values are 20 m for slovenia and 100 m for turkey živanović 2015 china stipulates that the classification of the first zone in a peak cluster depression conduit type water source can refer to the methods of surface river water source i e the upstream extent of the water source should not be less than 1000 m and the downstream should not be less than 100 m ministry of environment protection 2018 when a riverside karst spring is used as a water source it may be affected by the interaction between surface water and groundwater existing delineation method however does not consider the effects of hyporheic zones therefore whether or not this type of sanitary protection zone can truly play a conservation role is a question that deserves discussion the goal of this study was to investigate the hydrological and ecological processes of hyporheic zone at a karst spring fed pool that is affected by river backflow to discuss the appropriate indicators of aquatic environment and the variation mechanisms of it in the hyporheic zone then the effect of the environmental function of hyporheic zones on the delineation of sanitary protection zones at the spring fed pool was examined this research also broadens the definition of the hyporheic zone that consists primarily of karst conduit flows 2 overview of the study area the total area of the wuming basin which is located in the central guangxi region of china is 4536 km2 of which the area of the karst region is 3176 km2 this region is an important fruit production base in south china the annual rainfall of the wuming basin is 1247 mm and the mean annual temperature is 21 9 c the basin has abundant karst groundwater and 148 groundwater subsystems have been recorded of which lingshui is the largest with a drainage basin of 693 km2 jiang and guo 2012 sandong and dongfeng are the largest springs in the lingshui catchment area in addition luobotan and qinzhu are large springs in the basin fig 1 the wuming river and its primary tributaries the xi river and the xiangshan river are major surface rivers in the basin groundwater discharge is controlled by local river erosion of the datum plane and is mainly discharged through springs in the basin 70 of spring water is exposed in the riverbed or riparian zone and spring outlets form pools with large water body areas this environment provides conditions for river backflow into pool lingshui is a small lake pool formed from the concentrated discharge of 9 springs outlets s1 s9 s2 is the largest spring in the lingshui spring group and it is the main centralized drainage outlet of the aquifer the outlet of s2 is characterized by an l shaped karst conduit with a measured depth of 10 m s1 is the second big spring in addition the rest of the springs are submerged after discharge a pool with an area of 29 300 m2 is formed and the pool converges into the wuming river after flowing for 40 m lingshui is the only water source for 130 000 people in the city and s2 and s1 are outlets from which water is collected with pump volumes of 0 8 and 0 4 m3 s respectively currently during the low flow period the discharge of the lingshui spring group is 1 4 4 m3 s in most time of one hydrological cycle groundwater flows to wuming river after it discharges from the aquifer in the form of a spring group during heavy rains however the river flows back into the pool occasionally under this circumstance groundwater and surface water interacts here even the interaction is not processing all the time the sediment and nutrients matter carrying by surface water will deposit in the pool or even some organisms may stay and reproduce the effect of interaction is continuous and permanent therefore the spring fed pool is undoubtedly a unique hyporheic zone every year river backflow causes the turbidity of lingshui to exceed standards resulting in interruptions to the tap water supply this has resulted in persistent destruction to the ecological environment at the pool from 2010 to 2013 lingshui pool experienced a gradual loss in submerged plants and there are now no submerged plants from 2016 to the present e coli counts have exceeded standards there have been large numbers of tilapia and large amounts of fish feces have floated on the water surface or have been submerged at the bottom of the pool from 2017 to the present the local government has used metal wires to delineate a region with s2 as its center to 50 m in the pool as a sanitary protection red line rl in order to protect the lingshui water source in 2018 a 100 m long and 25 m wide pontoon swimming pool psp was constructed 30 m downstream of the red line 3 methods the largest spring lingshui in the wuming basin was selected and a detailed study of the hydrological dynamics of the groundwater groundwater surface water relationship and aquatic environment indicators was conducted since lingshui has a large area the study site needs to be divided into several sub regions the wuming river flows back into lingshui pool forming a mixed area of groundwater and surface water which is part of the estuary hyporheic zone the interaction range of groundwater and surface water in the hyporheic zone varies with hydrodynamic conditions the farthest boundary of the hyporheic zone reaches the depth of 5 m underwater at s2 outlet because of backflow of river water sediment deposits in the hyporheic zone previous studies have found that the content of organic carbon and carbon isotopes in sediments can be used to determine areas where groundwater and surface water are strongly mixed guo et al 2016 during the interaction process water temperature water chemistry and turbidity can also be used to determine the scope of the interaction the hyporheic zone in this study refers to the area from 100 m downstream of s2 to the end of the pool therefore groundwater outlets of s2 and s1 and their surrounding area can be classified as the groundwater zone gw while the convergence between the wuming river and lingshui represents the surface water zone sw meanwhile the region between the gw and sw is the groundwater surface water hyporheic zone hz fig 2 groundwater flowing into the river was defined as forward flow while river backflow into lingshui pool was defined as reverse flow 3 1 physical chemical parameters and water level monitoring in 2015 a monitoring station ms was built at

pool in a hydrological cycle groundwater flows towards the river in most of the time and forward flow occurs in the hyporheic zone during heavy rains however the river water level rises faster than the groundwater resulting in reverse flow when reverse flow occurs the water level of the hyporheic zone increases rapidly in 2017 rainfall was concentrated from may to september accounting for 70 of the annual rainfall during the low flow period the water level at the cross section of the monitoring station was 2 3 m during the high flow period the water level fluctuated due to frequent rainfall reaching a maximum of 7 3 m during the 10 year observation period through 2010 to 2019 the highest water level was 12 m the overall variations in ph t and sec were low at the interannual scale during the low flow period ph t and sec all exhibited diurnal nocturnal variations which were not significantly related to rainfall during the high flow period ph t and sec still remained constant and were inconsistent with rainfall occurrence or intensity fig 3 even though a portion of the 2017 high flow period data was missing because the apparatus was relocated in order to avoid flooding this phenomenon was observed repeatedly in other years in the gw zone groundwater flows out along several fractures in the bedrock with fast groundwater renewal the hydraulic condition at the s2 outlet was strong and the flow velocity was 0 05 0 23 m s in the hz the groundwater flow velocity was 0 03 0 2 m s fig 4 the cross sectional flow velocity measurements in the hz revealed that the water level was approximately 0 5 2 m and the flow velocity was 0 03 0 1 m s during the low flow period meanwhile the water level rose to 1 5 2 5 m and the flow velocity increased to 0 1 0 22 m s during the high flow period during the observed heavy rain events the cross sectional water level increased to 3 5 m due to the effects of river backwater or backflow but the groundwater flow velocity was only 0 01 0 1 m s 4 2 physical chemistry characteristics of groundwater in the spring pool system the ph t sec and do in lingshui pool showed gradual difference between the gw and the sw forward direction of water taking the physicochemical parameters at the bottom layer 2 m of the pool as an example the water temperature was 24 24 5 c near the gw and increased slightly during downstream discharge the ph in the vicinity of the gw ranged from 7 32 to 7 34 and increased in the downstream direction to 7 35 7 37 s7 is connected with s9 spring through karst conduit and it had the highest ph similarly do was the lowest in the gw region and gradually increased in the downstream direction sec did not exhibit a pattern similar to the other parameters sec was the highest at outlets s2 and s8 ranging from approximately 375 383 μs cm and it had lowest value at s7 350 360 μs cm fig 5 the mean values of the physiochemical parameters in the 3 regions were calculated in the longitudinal flow direction table 1 ph t and do increased from the gw zone to the sw zone the turbidity so4 2 and po4 3 in the sw zone were higher than those in the gw and hz although the depth of lingshui pool only ranges from approximately 1 3 m the physical chemical parameters of the water still exhibited some vertical gradients fig 6 t in all sites began to decrease at 0 2 m below the water surface the water temperature continuously decreased at a depth below 0 2 m in the gw zone while it began to keep stable below 0 5 m in the hz zone in the gw zone ph remained constant above 1 m and began to fall below 1 m in the hz zone ph decreased with depth especially where it closed to the sw zone the changes in sec were even more significant in general sec increased with depth except in regions with significant human disturbance in the pool c1 and c4 but when it closed to the sw the sec showed irregular changes the do decreased with depth in the gw but remained constant in the hz 4 3 chl a in early 2016 2017 at the start of the complete degeneration of the submerged plants the concentration range of chl a in lingshui pool was only 0 60 1 48 μg l in 2018 2019 the chl a concentration rapidly increased in spring season the chl a concentration values of s1 and s2 were 0 609 and 0 873 μg l respectively fig 7 in the center of the pool the variation ranges of the chl a concentration in the surface and bottom layers were 0 673 1 151 μg l and 0 940 4 288 μg l respectively in the swimming pool and its surroundings the chl a content significantly increased ranging from 0 808 to 1 149 μg l and 1 134 7 957 μg l in the surface and bottom layers respectively in winter season the overall chl a concentration significantly increased the mean chl a concentrations were 6 637 3 375 and 1 581 μg l in the surface layer of s1 the center of the pool and the swimming pool respectively in the bottom layer the variation range of the chl a concentration near s1 was greater ranging from 2 905 to 14 338 μg l with a mean value of 7 901 μg l in the center of the pool the variation range of the chl a was 10 053 13 374 μg l and the mean was 11 959 μg l in the swimming pool the variation range of the chl a concentration was 1 320 3 926 μg l and the mean was 2 899 μg l in the hyporheic zone of the pool the spatial and temporal variations of water temperature were very low and the chl a was not controlled by either t or ph the results of water samples collected at june 25 2015 showed the nitrogen and phosphorus contents were low and did not have a significant relationship with chl a sd and chl a exhibited a significant correlation table 2 4 4 fecal bacteria before 2010 e coli was seldom detected in the s2 spring from 2011 to 2016 although e coli was sometimes not detected counts of 9 240 cfu 100 ml were measured when e coli was detected fig 8 during both low flow and high flow periods e coli was not detected in s2 e coli was not detected in s1 during the low flow period but detected at a level of 520 cfu 100 ml during the rainy season overall the e coli counts within the red line ranged from 0 to 180 cfu 100 ml and ranged from 260 to 1080 cfu 100 ml outside the red line during the low flow period fig 9 the closer to sw zone the higher of e coli counts and it reached a peak of 1560 cfu 100 ml at the spring river convergence during the high flow period e coli was detected in all sites except s2 the e coli counts within the sanitary protection red line ranged from 0 to 1300 cfu 100 ml and were 60 cfu 100 ml outside the red line overall e coli counts were higher during the high flow period than during the low flow period within the red line 5 discussion 5 1 the influence of groundwater decline and river backflow on the hyporheic zone in the 1970 s the discharge of lingshui was 4 000 l s during low flow period continuous measurements from 2010 found the discharge of lingshui was 1 400 4 000 l s in dry seasons mostly about 2000 l s compared to the 1970 s the discharge of lingshui spring group during the low flow period in this stage has decreased by 12 5 50 among them the reduction of s2 was the greatest its proportion dropped from 23 of the total discharge in the 1980 s to 12 in this stage most of the springs in the basin were in similar conditions owing to a combination effect of land use change increasing pumping and changes in the precipitation regimes guo et al 2015 in contrast water demand has been increasing year by year in 2017 the volume of water collected from the lingshui spring was 24 times that of 1978 reaching 29 41 million m3 the decrease in spring discharge is also the main factor leading to changes in water quality in addition the increase in human activities and the increase in contamination load are also the reasons for the deterioration of water quality they weaken the self purification ability of the groundwater environment therefore hydrological functions the ability of hydrological exchange environment agency 2005 boulton et al 1998 that is physical effects such as dilution mixing scouring and sedimentation by hydrodynamics and hydrochemical functions the ability to promote the degradation the transformation of pollutants and the ability of exchange flow to provide nutrients to aquatic organisms agency 2009 boulton et al 1998 in the hyporheic zone are weakened the backflow of rivers into spring outlets or aquifers is a common phenomenon in karst areas in south china as mentioned earlier river backflow occurs once or several times a year in lingshui according to manual field observation river backflow will occur when the water level exceeds 99 m masl based on the hydrographs 4 times of river backflow events could be delineated in 2017 the duration time of the water level exceeded the threshold value for these events ranged from 7 to 46 h although the water levels dropped below 99 m afterward the influence of backflow still continued for some time backflow from rivers is a big threat to groundwater quality because water quality of the river is often worse than groundwater for example compared to the two samples taken on february 19 2009 and may 13 2015 it was found that the concentration of po4 3 in wuming river was 50 times that of lingshui the river water is poured back into the spring outlet or even aquifer which not only increase temporary turbidity but may also change the physical chemical properties and biological characteristics of groundwater albéric 2004 suspended particles brought by the river will reduce the water transparency of the hyporheic zone thereby reducing the photosynthesis of submerged plants organic matter decomposes subsequently this process consumes a large amount of oxygen making the water environment transit to a reducing environment these processes affect not only the water quality of water bodies but also the healthy growth of aquatic ecosystems due to the decrease in the flow of lingshui and the weakening of hydrodynamic conditions the possibility of river backflow increases observations found the river backflow events were 0 to 2 times in 2011 2014 while it was 4 times in 2017 indicating that the frequency of wuming river s flowing back into lingshui has increased we also found the duration of the backflow has become longer the consequence of backflow lasted from 1 to 3 days in 2011 2014 to 3 5 days in 2017 increasing frequency and duration of river backflow had a pronounced impact on the water environment of lingshui spring and even the entire aquifer guo et al 2019 5 2 causes of aquatic environment changes in the spring fed pool the above mentioned data revealed that groundwater discharges from spring and converges with the river during this process the water quality changes gradually a transition zone clearly exists between springs and rivers which is created from the interaction of groundwater and surface water the causes of the associated aquatic environment changes can be examined from multiple perspectives firstly these processes can be explored in terms of the river backflow effects during the low flow period and under forward flow the effects of the river aquatic environment on spring outlets are little when the reverse flow occurs the aquatic environment of the spring fed pool will be affected by the river the effects of river backwater on the hydraulic behavior at lingshui spring are reflected in 2 evidences 1 during the high flow period no corresponding relationship was found between water level of the pool and discharge in lingshui and the water level t and hydrochemistry sec changes were slight and asynchronous the changes in spring discharge reflect rainfall recharge within the catchment area and the groundwater runoff patterns in the system since the lingshui system is a large syncline aquifer characterized by karstic fractures network the hydrological dynamic is not sensitive to rainfall in contrast water level changes are mostly affected by river water levels river backflow causes changes in water quality in the pool resulting in water quality stratification groundwater is located in the bottom layer while river water is in the top layer since the online water quality monitor was installed at the bottom layer of the pool it was not affected by river water 2 the cross sectional flow velocity was inconsistent with water level flow velocity did not increase with water level during the extremely high water level period indicating that the increase in water level was caused by river backflow rather than the increase of karst spring discharge secondly the causes of the aquatic environment changes can be examined in terms of human activities the anthropogenic effects on the aquatic environment are measured from 2 perspectives 1 on a ten year scale it was proved that the contamination load experienced by the lingshui karst system exhibited an increasing trend from the 1970 s to 2019 nitrate content of s2 changed from nearly 0 to 10 mg l guo et al 2015 2 the pollutant of the pool had several different sources and migration pathways the codmn values of s2 and s1 were 4 23 and 11 2 mg l respectively with an average value of 7 19 mg l in the pool meanwhile a comparison of the e coli distribution showed that e coli could be detected at s1 in the high and low flow periods demonstrating that the effects of domestic pollutants on lingshui pool occur primarily through the s1 outlet thirdly the explanation of the aquatic environment changes can be investigated in terms of local environmental differences at the pool the hydrochemistry of karst spring is controlled by the lithology of carbonate rock and appears to be a simple and stable water type however it may undergo changes once the water has converged at the pool in that case abiotic factors depth sediment thickness and nature and substrate features can all affect hydrochemical characters grabowska et al 2014 biotic factors such as aquatic flora and fauna will drastically change the hydrochemical environment some submerged plants can decrease the turbidity of a water body and increase dissolved oxygen levels kosten et al 2009 lingshui karst spring pool underwent the stages of 1 vigorous submerged plants 2 dying out of submerged plants 3 phytoplankton proliferation 4 invasion of alien species tilapia and fish manure could not decompose in time and 5 e coli pollution resulting in a weakening of the biological function in the hyporheic zone and rapid changes of the local environment in the pool evidently although the water quality of lingshui spring keeps in good status from the view of inorganic hydrochemistry evaluation it is at the transition period from a macrophytic to an algal environment therefore the combination of hydrochemistry chl a and microorganisms represented by e coli more accurately reflects the status of the aquatic environment when a karst groundwater system is influenced by groundwater surface water interaction an ecosystem prospection including the physicochemical approaches of water plankton biomass and microorganisms should be better for identifying the environmental quality 5 3 strategy of sanitary protection zones in hyporheic zone the delineation of sanitary protection zones usually uses water intake sites as centers and semi circles with different radii superimposed on the upstream region as boundaries for various classes of protection zones based on the migration times of pollutants to the water intake site changes in the aquatic environment at the hyporheic zones reveal that major physicochemical parameters of water are indicators of the overall environmental quality of aquifers and reflect the internal and upstream effects of aquifers even though there are differences in water quality at different sites in the aquifer the mixing is completely after convergence in the spring fed pool during heavy rains river backflow into the pool occurs and the hydrochemistry will exhibit transient but significant gradients in this study concentrations of chl a which is an indicator of phytoplankton biomass were found to be high reflecting a deterioration of the ecosystem in the pool due to the effects of changeable hydraulic conditions in pool water the spatial distribution of chl a was variable e coli is a pathogenic microbe and is an indicator of health risk in drinking water even though the s1 and s2 are two karst springs closed to each other from the same aquifer e coli was seldom detected in s2 but frequently found in s1 indicating that e coli does not originate from the aquifer but rather from closely domestic pollutants around the pool during the high flow period e coli is often detected at the s1 spring signifying that pollutants are flushed into the pool mainly from the s1 pathway the higher e coli counts in the hz and sw suggest that swimming may be another major source of e coli before 2017 residents were allowed to swim anywhere in the pool now however swimming in the pool is forbidden since e coli levels exceed the standards in 2018 a pontoon swimming pool psp was built in the hz and then people began to swim in or around the psp the integrated analysis revealed that e coli may find a way to across the protection red line rl and migrate to upstream or enter the gw zone or even enter the pumping site s2 and inner aquifer through karst conduits that s why e coli can be detected occasionally in s2 spring therefore the governmental stipulation of a 50 m radius upstream of the water intake site as an immediate sanitary protection zone i may not provide protective effects completely the delineation of protection red line in the spring fed pool should consider the effects of hyporheic zones and then i zone should be expanded downstream of the water intake site the distance depends on the extent of hyporheic zone iʹ fig 10 6 conclusions karst springs emerged at river bank are sensitive on hydrological and ecological processes to environmental disturbance under the condition of forward flow ph t and do showed gradient changes in the direction of karst spring pool river under the influence of reverse flow the water level change of the pool was not synchronized with the water chemistry and the water body became stratified river backflow causes the spring fed pool to experience transient but strong groundwater surface water interaction due to the combined effects of facts such as land use change increased groundwater abstraction and climate change in the basin discharge in lingshui decreased significantly in dry seasons the hydraulic balance between groundwater and river has been broken and then the frequency and duration of river backflow have a trend of increase the changes weaken the hydrological and hydrochemical functions of the hyporheic zone after degeneration of submerged plants in the hyporheic zone phytoplankton rapidly blooms showing an increase in chl a it was also found that the spatial distribution of chl a was related to hydrodynamic conditions e coli could often be detected in the pool but there were differences in space and time e coli was mainly derived from the surrounding domestic sewage however when the slow flow was dominated in the pool e coli might also migrate from the river or the hyporheic zone to the upstream aquifer threatening the drinking water safety the aquatic environment of the spring fed pool is jointly affected by hydrological conditions the local environment and the intensity of human disturbance as a result the aquatic environment protection of the karst spring fed pool will not only be limited to the karst groundwater drainage basin but also extend to the rivers outside the basin our results showed the existing immediate sanitary protection zone might not provide complete protective effect it is recommended that the delineation of protection zones in a spring fed pool should consider the effects of hyporheic zone

5434,erosion is caused by detachment of soil materials from the surface of the soil matrix where they are held by cohesion and inter particle friction followed by transport of the detached particles away from the point of detachment it is well known that raindrop impact and surface water flow can be involved individually or together in causing erosion when raindrop impact causes erosion crusting may occur so that erosion rate varies with time flow depth influences detachment by raindrops in rain impacted flows so that detachment varies in space and time in addition splash transport associated with splash erosion and the transport of coarse material by raindrop induced saltation in rain impacted flows produces a layer of non cohesive material that also influences detachment in space and time various detachment and transport mechanism operate on surfaces eroding under artificial rainfall the spatial distribution of the mechanisms varies with flow conditions which are influenced by rainfall intensity slope length and slope gradient together with the infiltration characteristics of the soil surface detached particles travel across the soil surface at rates that depend on the size and density and the transport mechanisms involved and the steady state is not achieved until the slowest moving particle detached at the point farthest from the discharge point is discharged most experiments with artificial rainfall apply rain at a fixed intensity for a fixed time before the steady state occurs sediment discharge and composition produced when rainfall and runoff rates are both steady will vary with time total amounts or average rates of soil discharged in experiments of fixed duration will produce results that are dependent on the duration of the experiment this needs to be taken into account when designing and analysing experiments using artificial rainfall to erode soils keywords soil erosion rate rainfall intensity runoff slope length slope gradient 1 introduction in the past 5 years more than 100 papers per year have been published where artificial rainfall has been applied to inclined plane soil surfaces in laboratory and field experiments in laboratory experiments it is common to have a rectangular container of a given length width and depth that can be tilted to some selected gradient the container is designed in such a way that runoff together with the sediment it contains can be collected at the bottom end commonly soil material is packed into the container to a specified density procedures may also be adopted to ensure the soil has a preselected moisture content generally smooth planar surfaces are used once the experimental surface has been prepared rain is applied at some fixed rainfall intensity for a fixed time laboratory experiments have been undertaken on surfaces of various lengths ranging from less than about 0 5 m to about 5 m with gradients varying from less than 1 0 to more than 40 rainfall intensities used in these experiments have ranged from less than 50 mm h 1 to about 150 mm h 1 with events having durations varying from less than 15 min to a few hours experiments that focus on short slopes with high slope gradients can be considered to focus on interrill erosion as it is defined in the context of the so called process based wepp model laflen et al 1991 that focusses on erosion in ridge tillage systems in the experiments used to determine interrill erodibilities in the usa steady soil loss rates from 250 mm long planes inclined at about 50 were used elliot 1990 however the erosion plots used to develop the universal soil loss equation wischmeier and smith 1965 wischmeier and smith 1978 model were generally more than 20 m long and focussed on not only crops that were grown using ridge tillage but also crops that were grown on planar surfaces in the latter sheet erosion occurred as a general rule at the beginning of a rainstorm with rilling only occurring if flow conditions became severe enough cause detachment at a later time experiments with artificial rainfall in laboratory and field experiments are also undertaken where sheet erosion occurs throughout the event or rilling occurs after a period of sheet erosion rain impacted flows play a major role in the discharge of soil material in these experiments and experiments using short slopes with high slope gradients as a general rule when soil material is discharged by rain impacted flows sheet flow occurs and the area closest to the outlet contributes to the water discharged from the outlet during a rainfall event much sooner than an area further away from the outlet when water from the most remote point reaches the outlet and is discharged 100 of the watershed area contributes to the discharge in hydrology time of concentration is determined as the time needed for water to flow from the most remote point in a watershed to the watershed outlet time of concentration for runoff depends among other things on slope length and gradient and in most cases it is short in experiments where artificial rainfall is applied to inclined plane soil surfaces in the laboratory and many field experiments while surface water flows provide the transport medium for detached particles moving in rain impacted flows only particles moving in complete suspension move over the surface at about the same velocities as water in the flow coarse particles that move by saltation and rolling either raindrop induced or entirely flow driven move over the surface slower this is because they spend time resting on the soil surface between periods when they move in the flow lisle et al 1998 consequently the time of concentration for coarse sediment is longer than for runoff and is determined by the time needed for the slowest moving particle to travel from the most remote point in the eroding area to the outlet as indicated here that time depends on surface water flow conditions on the eroding area and the mechanisms moving the particles down to the outlet 2 detachment and transport in rain impacted flows it is well known that detachment the mobilization of particles held within the surface of the soil matrix can occur through the expenditure of raindrop and flow energy in flows not impacted by raindrops flows must exceed a critical flow condition below which no detachment by flow occurs however raindrops impacting flows less than about 3 drop diameters deep can detach soil particles when that critical flow condition has not been exceeded for erosion to occur particles need to be moved away from the site of detachment in rain impacted flows coarse material particularly sand and aggregates can move by raindrop induced saltation ris raindrop induced rolling rir flow driven saltation fds and flow driven rolling fdr kinnell 2012 flows have an inherent ability to transport soil material by flow driven saltation and rolling once flows exceed certain critical flow conditions that are dependent on particle size and density before those critical conditions are met coarse material can move by raindrop driven saltation and rolling whenever detachment occurs either by the expenditure raindrop or flow energy fine material moves in complete suspension fig 1 provides a schematic of how the various detachment and transport mechanisms are influenced when the shear stress is used as a measure of the inherent ability of the flow to detach and transport soil material fig 2 provides a schematic of the spatial distribution of the detachment and transport mechanisms that may operate as flow conditions vary on planar surfaces when rainfall intensity slope length and slope gradient vary in experiments involving rain impacted flow when rilling does not occur in sheet erosion areas or interrill areas on short slopes with high gradient usually at the start of a rainfall event the surface has no surface water flowing over it and so splash is the only mechanism that can move soil material downslope fig 2a splash tends to move particles radially from the point of drop impact and net downslope movement results from more material travelling downslope than upslope while particles can be splashed over a wide area by a drop impact the efficiency of transport of detached material is low on low gradient slopes no net movement away from the site of detachment occurs on flat horizontal surfaces when surface water flows develop on the eroding surface soil material may be discharged in both splash and the runoff fig 2b the presence of the surface water layer influences splash trajectories so that splash transport tends to decline with flow depth this decline in splash transport tends to be compensated by an increase in the ability of rain impacted flows to transport detached particles over the downstream boundary moss and green 1983 as flow depths increase from zero sediment transport by rain impacted flows tends to dominate in the area near the downstream boundary fig 2c 3 particle travel rates associated with raindrop induced saltation and rolling when coarse particles move by raindrop induced saltation ris soil material is lifted from the soil surface into the flowing water by a drop impact and it then falls back to the surface under the influence of gravity while in the flow the soil particles move downstream with the flow and so fall back to the surface some distance from where they were lifted into the flow by a drop impact although the uplift of particles from the surface produces a cloud the process can be represented by the scheme shown in fig 3 in this scheme a drop impact lifts particles from an area that depends on drop size and flow depth to produce a cloud that has projected area that is greater than the area disturbed by the drop impact the material lifted from the soil surface moves laterally downstream a distance that depends on flow velocity and the time the particles are in the flow before returning to the soil surface that time varies with the size of the impacting drops the size and density of the particles and the height the particles a lifted in the flow coarse particles moving in rain impacted flow comprise of both primary particles sand silt clay and aggregates generally because of differences in densities aggregates travel faster by raindrop induced saltation than particles of sand of the same size particles that are induced to roll also travel limited distances from the point of drop impact because soil material contains a multitude of particles with different sizes and density numerous time scales influence the movement of coarse material by raindrop induced saltation consequently each particle size and density combination has a time of concentration associated with it particles travelling from upslope move downslope in a dispersed wavefront fig 4 this is because the footprint of the material that falls back to the bed is larger than the footprint of the area impacted by the drop and many subsequent randomly timed drop impacts are needed to move all that material from where it fell the dispersion of particles detached from a point on the surface means that a time gap exists between the discharges of particles of a given size and density detached at the same time by a drop impacting at the upslope end of the eroding surface because of this gap the time taken for the last and not the first of the particles of a given size and density detached by that drop impact at the upslope end to be discharged determines that actual time of concentration for particles of that given size and density when a drop impacts the soil surface under a flow mpd the mass of particles of size p lifted from the soil surface under the flow by a drop of size d has two sources loose material sitting on the surface is not attached to that surface and will be lifted into the flow before detachment from the surface of the soil matrix takes place because moving loose material uses raindrop energy the more the amount of loose material sitting on the surface the less raindrop energy is available for detachment consequently loose material provides a degree of protection against detachment and 1 m pd h m pd l 1 h m pd c where mpd l is the mass of loose material lifted by a drop impact when the layer of loose material completely protects against detachment mpd c is the mass of soil material detached when no loose material exists on the surface and h is the degree of protection provided by loose material sitting on the surface h varies from 0 when there is no protection to 1 0 when there is complete protection for particles of a given particle size and density to be discharged without stimulation by subsequent raindrop impacts the drop impacts must occur within the distance xpd of the boundary the area extending upslope a distance xpd can be termed the active zone any drop impacting within the active zone results in sediment being discharged over the downstream boundary without stimulation by subsequent raindrop impacts because many particle sizes and densities exist in the material being transported numerous active zones operate simultaneously on surfaces when raindrop induced saltation occurs when drop impacts occur before runoff loose material is deposited on the surface by splash so that h 0 can occur when runoff commences the movement of soil material from upslope into the active zone usually causes loose material in the active zone to increase with time and as a result mpd l can completely dominate mpd in addition the composition of the layer of loose particles coarsens with time as the slow moving large particles detached upslope migrate over the surface ultimately when the particles being transported are stable the particle size distribution will tend towards that of the original soil even though the particle size distribution of the loose material is coarser than the original soil this occurs because of active zones for the smaller less dense particles moving by raindrop induced saltation extend upslope further than for the larger more dense particles for example if xpd for a less dense particle is twice that of another more dense particle then twice as many impacts in the active zone for the less dense particle generate the discharge of the less dense particles than the more dense particles generally the steady state occurs when the sediment enrichment ratio for all the actual particle sizes in the sediment is 1 0 and that will not be achieved if the duration of the experiment is not long enough fig 5 the sediment enrichment ratio is the ratio of the proportion of particles of a given size in the sediment and the proportion of the particles of that size in the original soil normally particle size data for soils is produced by dispersing soil material into primary components sediment enrichment ratios should be based on the measurement of the intact particles in the soil it is a mathematical fact that if the enrichment ratio for a particle differs from 1 0 then the enrichment ratio will differ for 1 0 in the opposite direction for one or more other sizes in order to compensate many soils produce detached particles that break down during transport asadi et al 2007 so that the enrichment ratio of 1 0 for all particle sizes actually being transported may not be achievable generally steady sediment discharge rates are seen as an indicator that steady state conditions occur when soil material is transported by raindrop induced saltation however when sediment discharge is controlled by raindrop impact induced saltation and rolling the slowest moving particles may be relatively few so that steady discharge rates may seem to occur long before equilibrium occurs true equilibrium many not actually occur in most laboratory experiments lisle et al 2017 experiments with sand and other stable materials have been valuable in demonstrating the factors that influence sediment transport by raindrop induced saltation the use of equipment such as shown in fig 6 under rainfall simulators producing mono sized raindrops has enabled the effects of rainfall intensity flow depth and sand size on the discharge of sand particles by rain impacted flow to be examined kinnell 1991 kinnell 1993b moss and green 1983 those experiments led to the empirical equation kinnell 1991 2 q sr p d a p i d u f h d where qsr p d is the sediment discharge mass flow width time of p sized particles induced by the impact of d sized raindrops impacting flows h deep flowing with a flow velocity of u id is the rainfall intensity of the rain with drop size d ap is an empirical coefficient that varies with particle size and density and f h d is a function that varies with flow depth and raindrop size as illustrated in fig 7 initially qsr p d increases with flow depth as it increases from zero before reaching a peak that varies with drop size before declining as flow depth increases further the effect of flow depth is two fold the absorption of drop energy in disturbing the flow reduces the mass lifted into the flow by each drop impact flow depth also influences xpd in very shallow flows the height to which particles are lifted is restricted by the shallowness of the flow so that tp d fig 3 initially increases as flow depth increases from h 0 at some drop size dependent flow depth the loss of energy in disrupting the flow becomes the factor restricting the height to which particles are lifted beyond that depth qsr p d decreases as flow depth increases f h d accounts for both the effect of flow depth on the mass lifted into the flow and tp d for sand particles varying from 0 1 mm to 0 9 mm ap varies by a factor of 4 6 over the 0 1 mm to 0 9 mm range in sand size kinnell 2009 eq 1 provides the capacity to apply the scheme shown in fig 3 to qualitatively model the effect of raindrop detachment and raindrop induced saltation in experiments using the apparatus shown fig 6 the scheme shown in fig 3 is relevant to 2 7 mm raindrop impacting 7 mm deep flows when the drops are travelling at or near terminal velocity and 0 46 mm sand particles spend 0 2 s moving downstream at the velocity of the flow after being mobilized by a drop impact kinnell 2006 fig 8 shows how the discharge of the 0 46 mm sand particles varies in flows with velocities of 10 mm s 1 and 100 mm 1 over both non cohesive and cohesive surfaces 500 mm long when the rain with only 2 7 mm drops has an intensity of 60 mm h 1 the model was also applied to the transport of fine sediment moving in complete suspension over the surface at the same velocity of the flow when cohesive surfaces occurred fig 8a and b show the discharges when the model was applied to the situation where the susceptibility of the cohesive surface remained constant with time for the fine sediment the time of concentration varies from 5 s when the flow velocity is 100 mm s 1 to 50 s when the flow velocity is 10 mm s 1 when the non cohesive surface erodes the sediment discharge of the 0 46 mm sand is generally constant over time short term variations occur because of the random spatial distribution of drop impacts used in the model however when the cohesive surface erodes the discharge of the coarse material when mpd c remains constant throughout the event increases with time to reach the same rates as when the non cohesive surface erodes fig 8a and b the steady rates are achieved sooner with the 10 mm s 1 flow velocity than when the flow velocity is 100 mm h 1 this is because the slower rate of travel of the 0 46 mm sand across the surface encourages more rapid development of the layer of coarse material towards that where full protection against detachment occurs at the downstream end the decline in the discharge of fine material is caused by the temporal and special increase in the protection provided by the coarse layer the model was also applied to the case where the amount of material detached by a drop impact declined with time according to the equation 3a m pd c t m pd c exp 0 332 t t 10 min 3b m pd c t m pd c exp 3 32 t 10 min where t min is the time from the start of the rain kinnell 2006 mpd c 10 0 04 mpd c eq 3 is used to mimic the change in susceptibility to detachment caused by crusting when the flow velocity is 10 mm s 1 the discharge of the 0 46 mm sand fig 8c is similar to that produced when the susceptibility to detachment remained constant fig 8a however it takes longer for the discharge of the 0 46 mm sand to become steady than when the susceptibility to detachment remains constant in contrast the discharge of the 0 46 mm sand when the flow was 100 mm s 1 over the surface where the susceptibility of detachment declines with time reaches a peak after about 10 min before declining to become steady after about 20 min fig 8d the peak discharge is considerably less than the steady discharge achieved with the non cohesive surface in this case the cohesive layer does not provide complete protection at the downstream end when soil is used in the equipment shown in fig 6 eq 2 is replaced by 4 q sr s d a s i d u f h d where s stands for a given soil kinnell 2013 in these circumstances as can be considered as an index of the erodibility of the soil surface it has been observed that the f h d flow depth relationships obtained for sand also apply to soils even though those relationships were obtained for only non cohesive surfaces as is an empirical factor that is influenced by the susceptibility of the soil surface to detachment and the sizes and densities of the particles being transported but eq 4 has no provision to take direct account of particle sizes and densities on sediment discharges the soil material moving in the flow comprises of both primary particles and aggregates and aggregates are completely disintegrated in the procedures normally used to determine soil particle size consequently data normally collected on physical and chemical properties of soils do not usually provide information useful to predicting as also the design of the equipment does not facilitate the collection of temporal variations in sediment discharge such as those obtained by modelling the detachment and transport mechanisms fig 8 consequently the results obtained for a given soil may vary depending on the duration of the rainfall event and flow velocities used in the experiment this is illustrated in by the average discharge rates of 0 46 mm sand for rainfall durations of 10 20 and 30 min and over the last 10 min shown in table 1 in the cases where the flow velocity is 10 mm s 1 the average discharge rates of the sand increase with rainfall duration and are highest during the last 10 min the same applies for average discharges of the sand for 100 mm s 1 flows when mpd c remains constant but they decline with duration when mpd c declines with time and the lowest discharge rates occur during the last 10 min as noted by walker et al 1978 and evident from fig 5 coarse and very coarse sand that is induced to roll can move quite rapidly in rain impacted flows over smooth surfaces parsons et al 1998 undertook experiments with unconstrained 2 88 mm to 10 63 mm gravel particles induced to move in rain impacted flows on a fixed bed of sand 1 mm 2 mm inclined at between 3 5 and 10 and measured the distance travelled in 15 min they suggested that the product of particle mass and transport rate varied with the product of rainfall kinetic energy to a power greater than 2 0 and runoff kinetic energy to a power near 1 0 little work has been done to develop models that can deal appropriately with the effects and interactions between particles size shape and density and surface roughness on the movement of particles that roll in rain impacted flows 4 raindrop detachment and flow driven transport as noted above very fine material detached by raindrop impact travels in complete suspension in the flow as flows travel downslope they may gain the ability to transport soil material by flow driven saltation and rolling fig 2d kinnell 2009 presented a qualitative model that simulated sediment transport by both raindrop induced and flow driven saltation on inclined slopes 2 m to 30 m long raindrop induced saltation was modelled using the scheme shown in fig 3 flow velocities along the inclined planes were modelled using kinematic overland flow moore and kinnell 1987 an equation developed by larionov et al 2006 was used to determine critical velocities for the onset of flow driven saltation fig 9 a shows the depths and velocities of the outflow modelled for 100 mm h 1 rainfall on a 2 m impermeable slope inclined between 5 and 55 together with the critical velocities for 0 46 mm coal and 0 11 mm sand when travelling by flow driven saltation particles travelled at velocities determined by govers 1989 fig 9b shows the discharges of particles travelling by raindrop induced saltation and flow driven saltation for the 2 m long slope using the qualitative model developed by kinnell 2009 when particles travel by flow driven saltation and rolling the upslope end of the active zone for the discharge of material detached by raindrop impact is effectively increased by the distance from the downstream boundary where flow driven bedload transport begins the increase in discharge of 0 46 mm coal when slope gradients exceed 30 results from that increase when particles travel by flow driven saltation it is assumed in the model that they do not contribute to the protection of loose material against detachment by raindrop impact consequently the value of h is less in at the downstream end of the eroding area when flow driven saltation of 0 46 mm coal occurs this results in an increase in the discharge of the particles that are still being discharged by raindrop induced saltation when slope gradients exceed 30 likewise an increase in the discharge of the particles that are still being discharged by raindrop induced saltation occurs when slope gradients exceed 45 when 0 11 mm sand is discharged by flow driven saltation it should be noted that while the model has been parameterized using empirical data the model is a qualitative model and the values shown in fig 9b are hypothetical however flow conditions can occur where all particles detached by raindrop impact are discharged by flow driven mechanisms that operate in the area adjacent to the downstream boundary as shown in fig 10 the transition from raindrop induced bedload transport to flow driven bedload transport has been demonstrated in experiments with poorly sorted sand in a 3 m long slope by moss et al 1979 5 aerial accession of detached material to rain impacted flows given the results of experiments on the effect of flow depth on splash transport such as those reported by moss and green 1983 it is generally acknowledged that splash transports detached material from areas where no surface water is present to areas where flows subsequently transport detached material downstream in their experiments comparing discharges of soil material in rain impacted flows and aerially by splash moss and green collected splashed material that passed in the air over the downstream end of the eroding surface shown in fig 6 moss and green clearly showed that the ratio of the material splashed over the boundary of an eroding area and the material discharged in the rain impacted flow varies with flow depth fig 11 is a schematic of the separation of the materials moving by splash and raindrop induced saltation in the moss and green experiments in this scheme material falling onto the rain impacted flow will move downstream as they fall through the flow in the scheme some of the splashed material that falls onto the flow adjacent end of the eroding surface will be discharged with the flow at the same time as material that did not become airborne this situation is not normally considered when data from experiments with rain impacted flows are analysed because the contribution of splashed material to sediment discharge by rain impacted flows is usually ignored recently experiments have been done where soil material splashed to slots along the sides of the eroding area was collected and measured wu et al 2019a 2018 zhang et al 2019 2018 the stated purpose of doing this was to measure detachment by raindrop impact under rain impacted flows on short slopes inclined at gradients greater than 10 wu et al 2019b this objective was not met kinnell et al 2019 because a not all the soil material detached by raindrop impact becomes airborne and b the material splashed to the slots contains not just material detached by the drop impacts producing the splash but also material detached previously however the material splashed into the slots provides a measure of detached material that falls into the flow from the air that is subsequently moved and discharged by the rain impacted flow theoretically the mass lifted into the air by a drop impact is given by 4 m pd a a m pd and the mass mobilised that remains in the flow 5 m pd f b m pd where mpd is the mass of particles of size p lifted from the soil surface under the flow by a drop described by eq 1 and a b 1 0 when the material lifted into the flow by a drop impact returns to the soil surface it is spread over a bigger area of the soil surface than the area disturbed by the drop causing the saltation jump fig 11 likewise the material lifted into the air by a drop impact returns to the soil surface generally it is spread over a bigger area of the soil surface than the area disturbed by the drop causing the saltation jump experiments on raindrop splash produced when raindrops impact surface water indicate that that area varies with flow depth that area is relatively large in shallow flows where b tends to be high b decreases with flow depth while h tends to increase in the downslope direction and with the ease of detachment but decrease with the flow velocity in very shallow flows sediment transport by raindrop induced saltation becomes severely restricted by the height of the water surface whereas the ability of drop impacts to cause particles to become airborne increases in the experiments using a clayey loessal soil in a 0 8 m long surface inclined various gradients between 12 3 and 46 6 under rain with intensities ranging from 42 mm h 1 to 90 mm h 1 zhang et al 2019 observed after a period of no runoff where splash erosion generated loose material on the soil surface the rates material was collected in the slots decreased with time to reach a steady rate within the 40 min duration of the experiments however for the 42 mm h 1 and 60 mm h 1 rain sediment discharges by rain impacted flows initially increased before reaching a peak and declining as time progressed fig 12 in contrast sediment discharges for 90 mm h 1 rains on the 25 degree slope declined with time right from the start of runoff altogether what takes place to influence the amounts of material splashed and discharged in the flow is complex further research into the mechanisms that operate on slopes with very shallow flows on high gradient is warranted 6 flow detachment and flow driven transport as noted above flow conditions can occur where all particles detached by raindrop impact are discharged by flow driven mechanisms that operate in the area adjacent to the downstream boundary once flow conditions occur that enable flows to detach soil material from the surface of the soil matrix without the aid of raindrop impact it is possible that in very shallow flows both raindrop detachment and flow detachment can occur in the area adjacent to the downstream boundary at the same time fig 2e under those circumstances all particles discharged over the downstream boundary are transported over the boundary by flow driven transport mechanisms irrespective of whether they are detached by raindrop impact or flow shear the occurrence of both raindrop detachment and flow detachment together in the area adjacent to the downstream boundary leads to an increase in sediment discharge but often rilling is initiated when flow detachment at the downstream end the migration of rills in the upslope direction leads to sediment discharge being dominated by soil particles that have been detached by flow shear this tends to result in particle size distributions matching those in the original soil kiani harchegani et al 2018 differences in particle composition for interrill and rill sources have also been observed by greenwood and zhang 2020 it is generally recognised that sediment entering rills from interrill areas can reduce the detachment capacity of flow within rills liebenow et al 1990 7 discussion as noted above frequently experiments under artificial rain often involve the use of planar soil surfaces of some given length inclined some particular gradient exposed to rain of an intensity that will lead to runoff occurring during the experiment often a period of time with no runoff occurs at the beginning of the rainfall event and raindrop detachment with splash transport will operate over the whole of the eroding surface rd st fig 2a historically considerable interest in splash erosion was generated by the understanding that raindrop impact was a major contributor to the initiation of soil erosion that followed work by ellison 1944 this led to the use of splash cups containing sand to measure the erosive effect of rainfall bisal 1950 1960 geißler et al 2010 scholten et al 2011 although exposing sand in a small circular container appears to be a simple way to measure the erosive effect time is a factor initially the sand surface is smooth and flush with the cup rim raindrops impacting near the rim not only splash particles but push sand over the side of the cup kinnell 1974 this results in high losses being recorded when splash cups are weighed to measure oven dried sand before and after rain also the rate of splash loss changes as the surface becomes pitted later splash can be intercepted by the inside wall of the cup as the sand surface falls some distance below the rim factors such as sand size and moisture suction sloneker et al 1976 also influence losses of sand from splash cups in most cases rainfall intensities produced by artificial rainfall cause ponding to occur in splash cups containing soil the development of a layer of water on the surface affects splash trajectories ghadiri 2004 ghadiri and payne 1988 mutchler and hansen 1970 so that usually using soil in splash cups does not provide measurements of soil loss suitable for determining susceptibilities of soil to rainfall erosion raindrop impact can cause aggregate breakdown and crusts to develop on the soil surface the development of surface crusts has a major influence on detachment by raindrop impact before runoff changes in the physical properties of the soil surface generated by raindrop impact can also influence infiltration and the onset of runoff bissonnais and singer 1992 le bissonnais et al 1995 splash tends to transport detached material radially from the point of drop impact and splash more material upslope than downslope when the soil surface is inclined as a result splash can generate appreciable amounts of loose material on top of the soil matrix before runoff occurs when soil aggregates are stable runoff produced by rainfall is only generated when the rainfall rate exceeds the infiltration rate and the infiltration rate associated with a soil varies with soil moisture rubin and steinhardt 1963 tisdall 1951 once runoff begins water begins to flow over the downstream boundary initially the source of that flow is runoff generated close to the downstream boundary and only soil material detached close the downstream boundary is discharged by the flow when runoff begins as time progresses runoff generated further upslope adds to the runoff generated close to the boundary steady runoff rates under steady rainfall rates occur when a infiltration rates are steady and b runoff from the farthest point from the outfall is discharged as noted above fine material detached by drop impact and flow shear travelling in suspension will always be transported by the flow and about the same velocity as the flow once flow is initiated on the soil surface surface water flows provide a vehicle to transport not only fine particles but also coarse material when flows are very shallow the movement of coarse material by raindrop induced saltation is severely restricted by the distance between the soil surface and the top of the flow considerable amounts of detached soil material may become airborne so that both splash and transport in rain impacted flows operate at the same time in the same area fig 2b coarse particles travelling by raindrop induced saltation travel at velocities that vary with their size and density fine material moving in complete suspension travel faster than coarse material moving by bedload transport generally the variation in particle travel rates leads to the composition of the sediment discharge being dominated by fine material initially and becoming coarser with time until the steady state exists slope length is often considered an independent variable when analysing results from experiments using artificial rainfall but the effective slope length is shorter than the physical length before the steady state is reached failure to reach the steady state is often seen in experiments when the sediment discharge rate does not become steady before the end of the experiment while the effective slope length for runoff has stabilized frequently that is not the case for the discharge of detached particles in many experiments even if the effective slope length for sediment discharge has stabilized during the experiment analysing data in terms of average rates of soil loss or averages of a number of particle size distributions obtained during the experiment will produce results that are highly dependent on the duration of the experiment the results may be appreciable different if the duration of the experiment were different also the steady state particle size distributions are likely to be appreciably different from event based averages the consequence of assuming that steady state conditions exist when they do not is illustrated by results presented by zhang 2019 zhang presented results from experiments where 4 sections in 1 8 m long flumes were sequentially exposed to rainfall during 15 min periods during an hour where rainfall intensity and slope gradient remained constant the upslope areas were protected by a tarp in one treatment a screen placed 5 cm above the soil surface to provide sheet flow protected from raindrop impact was used in another treatment in the first 15 min of experiments lasting 1 h the bottom quarter of the flumes was exposed to rainfall produced by the rainfall simulator in the 2nd 15 minute period erosion by the rainfall occurred on the bottom half of the flumes three quarters of the flume areas was exposed in the 3rd 15 minute period with the whole area being exposed in the 4th 15 minute period in the first hour 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity was used in the 2nd hour the exposure sequence was repeated with 90 mm h 1 rainfall intensity and 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensity in the 3rd hour zhang assumed that the average sediment discharges g m 1 min 1 obtained during each 15 min were steady state sediment discharges although there was evidence that rainfall intensity influenced the measured average sediment discharges zhang observed that the average sediment discharges were linearly related stream power which is directly related to the product of slope gradient and flow discharge when rainfall intensity is held constant the direct relationship between average sediment discharge and stream power indicates that a direct relationship exists between the 15 min sediment concentration the mass of soil discharged per unit volume of water discharged in 15 min and slope gradient however fig 5 in zhang 2019 shows that the sediment concentrations at outlet in both the trap and screen experiments increased with elapsed time that figure provides evidence to dispute the claim made by zhang that his analyses were done when steady state conditions existed it also needs to be kept in mind that each 15 min event on a given section is in effect a pre treatment for the next 15 min event on that section consequently the results obtained during each 15 min period depends on what happened during the previous 15 min changing the sequence of rainfall intensities applied during the three hours eg high intensity first and low intensity last or changing the time of exposure from 15 min may produce quite different results hysteretic loops in sediment fluxes have been observed when rainfall intensities have been varied stepwise from low to high and back again cheraghi et al 2016 the fact that the results obtained for steady state rates of soil loss are likely to be appreciably different from event based averages is an issue that is relevant to the determination of interrill erodibility in the wepp model laflen et al 1991 wepp is a steady state erosion prediction model in the experiments used to determine interrill erodibilities in the usa steady soil loss rates from interrill plots were used elliot 1990 some experiments done to determine wepp interrill experiments by others do not conform to this for example in experiments reported by vaezi et al 2018 total soil losses produced during one hour of rainfall were used to determine wepp interrill erodibilties also vaezi et al 2018 and deviren saygin et al 2018 used 1 m long flat planar surfaces a design quite different from the interrill plots used by elliot 1990 the interrill plots used in the wepp experiments in the usa were designed to be relevant to erosion in areas where ridge tillage cultivation was practised these plots were 500 mm wide and 750 mm long with sides sloping approximately 50 towards a metal longitudinal channel in the centre consequently the flow length on each plane was about 250 mm the wepp experiments in the usa also collected runoff and soil loss from flat planar plots 750 mm long and 500 mm wide elliot 1990 but these were installed to determine infiltration not erodibility kinnell 1993a showed that interrill erodibilities determined using these flat plots differed appreciably from the ones determined using the interrill plots arguably the differences between the erodibilities obtained for the interrill plots and the infiltration plots were caused by differences in the depth and velocities of the flows that occurred on the eroding surfaces wepp is designed to predict soil loses from ridge tillage agriculture and experiments to parameterize the model need to use plot designs that are appropriate to this outcome wepp can be calibrated to predict soil losses from rainstorms on planar usle type plots that are 20 m long or more but the predictions can be less reliable than predicted by the usle m kinnell 2017 the usle m is an event version of the usle kinnell and risse 1998 slope length is not considered as an independent variable in the prediction of interrill erosion by wepp the basic form of interrill erosion model in wepp is 6 d i k i i s f r where di is the erosion rate mass area time ki is the interrill erodibility i is rainfall intensity sf is the wepp slope gradient factor r is runoff rate zhang and wang 2017 conducted experiments where a soil with 39 sand 45 silt and 16 clay in surfaces with lengths ranging from 0 4 m to 2 0 m inclined at gradients ranging from 17 6 to 57 7 were exposed to rain with intensities ranging from 40 to 170 mm h 1 for one hour from the apparent steady sediment discharges obtained during the last 30 min in these experiments zhang and wang proposed that 6 d i k i i s f r a l b where l is slope length and a and b are empirical constants for the soil used in their experiments ki a and b were 132 9 0 242 and 0 137 in comparison a 1 and b 0 in wepp interrill model so that the equation proposed by zhang and wang 2017 indicates that for the soil they used runoff rate vol area time was not as effective in influencing interrill erosion as indicated by the wepp interrill model in generating and parameterizing eq 6 zhang and wang 2017 took no account of the sequence of detachment and transport mechanisms that operated in their experiments they state that generally no rill erosion initiated during the 60 min event early signs of rill initiation with small scouring holes were observed near the rainfall end in a few events this indicates that the situation depicted in fig 2e occurred in some of their experiments it is not clear exactly which of the other situations depicted in fig 2 occurred in the individual experiments but variations in the sequences of detachment and transport mechanisms operating on the eroding surfaces as rainfall intensity slope length and slope gradient varied may have influenced the results that generated eq 6 many experiments do not focus on a particular model of rainfall erosion but often the focus is on developing an empirical equation for event soil loss with rainfall intensity slope length and slope gradient as independent variables in some cases flow shear stress stream power and unit steam power are used zhang et al 2018 these variables all focus on slope gradient and either flow depth or flow discharge or flow velocity and are often considered without due regard as to the possible influence these hydraulic factors may actually have on soil loss as indicated above even if the effective slope length for sediment discharge has stabilized during the experiment the parameterization of the emperical equation will depend on the duration of the experiment different results are likely to occur if the experiment is repeated using a different duration also for the same set of rainfall intensities slope lengths and slope gradients the sequence of detachment and transport mechanisms fig 2 that operate using a different soil may be quite different this is illustrated by comparing the results presented by zhang et al 2019 with those presented by wu et al 2018 contrary to the results shown in fig 12 sediment discharges for the soil used by wu et al continued to increase with time over the whole of the 40 min event equations developed for the effect of factors such as rainfall intensity slope length and gradient on soil loss in an experiment tend specific to that experiment because different soils can behave quite differently under the same set of imposed conditions the lack of influence of slope length on short slopes with high slope gradient contrasts to the effects of slope length obtained when rain impacted flows operate on soils on longer slopes with lower gradients under natural rainfall in the field as noted above in relation to erodibilities obtained for wepp interrill and infiltration plots short lengths and high gradients produce flow conditions that differ considerably to those that occur on longer lengths and lower gradients in particular very shallow flows impose severe restrictions on sediment transport by raindrop driven saltation while high flow velocities favour flow driven bedload transport in their experiments zhang and wang 2017 reported flow depths ranging from 0 04 to 0 16 mm and velocities ranging from 46 to 269 mm s 1 in contrast generally sheet flows are several millimetres deep on longer surfaces with lower gradients there are experiments where artificial rainfall applied to planar areas generated rills after a period of time where sheet erosion occurred berger et al 2010 greenwood and zhang 2020 kiani harchegani et al 2018 qin et al 2018 shen et al 2016 shi et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 in these experiments interrill erosion contributes soil material to flow driven transport processes that operate in the rills rill flows are known to have a limited capacity to transport soil material so that the capacity for rill flows to detach and transport soil material within the rill can be reduced by the amount of sediment entering the rill from interrill areas while shallow flows may occur in interrill areas that occur on these plots generally flow velocities are much lower than on steep slopes consequently experiments on short steep slopes are not particularly useful in determining what contribution interrill erosion makes to the sediment discharged by rills on planar slopes the situation where both flow driven detachment and rainfall driven detachment operate simultaneously has been studied in experiments where surface water flow are generated by both rain and water input at the upslope end of the planar surface wen et al 2015 in experiments reported by singer and walker 1983 a soil with 13 9 2 µm 36 1 2 20 µm 18 8 20 50 µm 4 3 50 100 µm 8 9 100 250 µm and 18 0 250 2000 µm in a 3 m flume inclined 9 at was subjected to combinations of inflow and rainfall in addition to inflow alone and rainfall alone for 30 min two rainfall rates 50 100 mm h 1 and an inflow rate equivalent to a runoff rate of 100 mm h 1 were used beds exposed to rainfall or a combination of rainfall and inflow were not saturated by the end of the experiments and were crusted beds exposed to inflow alone were saturated before 30 min had passed showed no sign of a seal and there was evidence of minor rilling differences in surface condition between when erosion is caused by flow alone and by rain impacted flow must be taken into account when analysing experiments like these arguably it would be more appropriate to apply the inflow alone treatment after surfaces have been exposed to rain impacted flows some temporal variations in soil loss rates occurred but 50 mm h 1 rains with 100 mm h 1 inflows produced soil loss rates that averaged 3 7 times those produced by 50 mm h 1 rain alone 100 mm h 1 rains produced 3 6 times the 50 mm h 1 alone soil loss rates while the 100 mm h 1 rains with 100 mm h 1 inflow produced 7 85 times the 50 mm h 1 alone soil loss rates given that flow depths and velocities varied between the rain and flow combinations it is not possible to determine what if any detachment by flow shear contributed to the soil losses measured experiments like these in other experiments designed to investigate the effects of detachment by raindrop impact and flow shear experiments have been undertaken where soil losses produced by artificial rainfall have been compared with losses produced when flows are protected from raindrop impact by fine netting screens placed above the eroding surface for example lu et al 2016 use a 1 mm aperture nylon screen suspended 10 cm above an 8 m long planar surface using two gradients 8 7 17 6 in experiments with 50 mm h 1 and 100 mm h 1 rains produced by nozzles 16 m above the eroding surfaces they assumed that comparison of the soil losses obtained for the artificial rain and the protected treatments enabled them to determine the soil losses caused by raindrop impact and caused by flow detachment separately arguably this assumption is not correct because of differences in the soil surface conditions under the two treatments lu et al note that the nylon net prevented surface seal formation and increased infiltration the movement of water through the soil surface not only affects flow depth and velocity but may also affect the resistance of the soil surface to detachment experiments on the effects of exfiltration on erosion by rain impacted flow an et al 2013 huang and laften 1996 wang et al 2020 need to consider the effect of the water movement through the soil surface on both the resistance of the soil surface to detachment by raindrop impact and flow depth and velocity in the rain impacted flows 8 conclusion erosion is caused by detachment of soil material from the surface of the soil matrix where they are held by cohesion and inter particle friction followed by transport of the detached particles away from the point of detachment it is well known that raindrop impact and surface water flow can be involved individually or together in causing erosion prior to surface water developing on the soil surface erosion is caused by raindrop impacting detaching and transporting soil material away from the site of detachment aerially by splash in flows not impacted by raindrops flows must exceed a critical flow condition below which no detachment by flow occurs before detachment by flow shear can take place however raindrops impacting flows a few millimetres or less deep less can detach soil particles when that critical flow condition has not been exceeded when surface water flows occur detachment and transport of soil material may occur by raindrop impact and splash transport rd st raindrop detachment with transport by complete suspension in the flow rd fs raindrop detachment and transport by raindrop induced saltation rd ris or by raindrop induced rolling rd rir raindrop detachment and transport by flow driven saltation rd fds or by flow driven rolling rd fdr flow detachment with transport by complete suspension in the flow fd fs and flow detachment and transport by flow driven saltation fd fds or by flow driven rolling fd fdr because flow conditions vary in time and space the mechanisms that control detachment and transport of soil material in the downslope direction vary in time and space as indicated in fig 2 the suite of detachment and transport mechanisms that occur on an eroding surface where rain impacted flows occur may vary with rainfall intensity slope gradient and slope length the transition from the transport of detached material by splash to transport by rain impacted flow is influenced by flow depth fine material is always transport in completer suspension irrespective of the detachment mechanism coarse material is transported by saltation and rolling the transition from raindrop induced transport to flow driven transport of coarse material is often considered to be influenced by flow shear critical value τc loose fig 1 the onset of flow detachment is often associated with a critical value of flow shear τc bound fig 1 flow depth has a major influence on detachment by raindrop impact raindrop energy is used in penetrating the surface water so that spatial and temporal variations in raindrop detachment result from variations in flow depth over the eroding surface soil surfaces are affected by the detachment and transport mechanisms that operate to cause erosion raindrop impact on surfaces not covered by can cause soil surfaces to crust and change the resistance of the soil surface to detachment associated with raindrop detachment followed by transport by splash the resultant changes in the susceptibility to detachment will influence subsequent detachment by raindrops impacting flow and flow shear coarse material loose material that results from splashed material falling back to the surface forms a non cohesive layer of material sitting on the surface of the soil matrix this layer provides a degree of protection against the detachment of material from the surface of the soil matrix by subsequent drop impacts detached soil material that falls back to the soil surface after being lifted into the flow by a drop impact also contributes to the non cohesive layer the presence of this layer together with the effect of flow depth on the ability of drop impacts to cause detachment causes detachment to vary in space and time under rain impacted flows particles that are discharged with the flow travel from the point of detachment at rates that vary with their size and density and the mechanisms that transport them the net movement of material transported aerially by splash varies with slope gradient and is very slow when slope gradients are low there is an increase in transport rate of coarse material when raindrop induced saltation and rolling occur on such slopes and a further increase occurs when flow driven saltation and rolling occur fine material travelling in complete suspension travels at about the same velocities as the flow consequently variations in the suite of detachment and transport mechanisms that operate on an eroding surface influence how fast particles of various size and density travel for the site of detachment to the point where they are discharged given that the steady state in not achieved until the slowest moving particle detached from the farther point from the discharge point is discharged the time taken to reach the steady state depends on what suite of detachment and transport mechanisms operate on the eroding surface most experiments with artificial rainfall apply rain at a fixed intensity for a fixed period of time prior to the steady state occurring sediment discharge and composition produced when rainfall rates are steady will vary with time consequently total amounts or average rates of soil discharged in experiments of fixed duration will produce results that are dependent on the duration of the experiment this needs to be taken into account when designing and analysing experiments using artificial rainfall to erode soils declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
5434,erosion is caused by detachment of soil materials from the surface of the soil matrix where they are held by cohesion and inter particle friction followed by transport of the detached particles away from the point of detachment it is well known that raindrop impact and surface water flow can be involved individually or together in causing erosion when raindrop impact causes erosion crusting may occur so that erosion rate varies with time flow depth influences detachment by raindrops in rain impacted flows so that detachment varies in space and time in addition splash transport associated with splash erosion and the transport of coarse material by raindrop induced saltation in rain impacted flows produces a layer of non cohesive material that also influences detachment in space and time various detachment and transport mechanism operate on surfaces eroding under artificial rainfall the spatial distribution of the mechanisms varies with flow conditions which are influenced by rainfall intensity slope length and slope gradient together with the infiltration characteristics of the soil surface detached particles travel across the soil surface at rates that depend on the size and density and the transport mechanisms involved and the steady state is not achieved until the slowest moving particle detached at the point farthest from the discharge point is discharged most experiments with artificial rainfall apply rain at a fixed intensity for a fixed time before the steady state occurs sediment discharge and composition produced when rainfall and runoff rates are both steady will vary with time total amounts or average rates of soil discharged in experiments of fixed duration will produce results that are dependent on the duration of the experiment this needs to be taken into account when designing and analysing experiments using artificial rainfall to erode soils keywords soil erosion rate rainfall intensity runoff slope length slope gradient 1 introduction in the past 5 years more than 100 papers per year have been published where artificial rainfall has been applied to inclined plane soil surfaces in laboratory and field experiments in laboratory experiments it is common to have a rectangular container of a given length width and depth that can be tilted to some selected gradient the container is designed in such a way that runoff together with the sediment it contains can be collected at the bottom end commonly soil material is packed into the container to a specified density procedures may also be adopted to ensure the soil has a preselected moisture content generally smooth planar surfaces are used once the experimental surface has been prepared rain is applied at some fixed rainfall intensity for a fixed time laboratory experiments have been undertaken on surfaces of various lengths ranging from less than about 0 5 m to about 5 m with gradients varying from less than 1 0 to more than 40 rainfall intensities used in these experiments have ranged from less than 50 mm h 1 to about 150 mm h 1 with events having durations varying from less than 15 min to a few hours experiments that focus on short slopes with high slope gradients can be considered to focus on interrill erosion as it is defined in the context of the so called process based wepp model laflen et al 1991 that focusses on erosion in ridge tillage systems in the experiments used to determine interrill erodibilities in the usa steady soil loss rates from 250 mm long planes inclined at about 50 were used elliot 1990 however the erosion plots used to develop the universal soil loss equation wischmeier and smith 1965 wischmeier and smith 1978 model were generally more than 20 m long and focussed on not only crops that were grown using ridge tillage but also crops that were grown on planar surfaces in the latter sheet erosion occurred as a general rule at the beginning of a rainstorm with rilling only occurring if flow conditions became severe enough cause detachment at a later time experiments with artificial rainfall in laboratory and field experiments are also undertaken where sheet erosion occurs throughout the event or rilling occurs after a period of sheet erosion rain impacted flows play a major role in the discharge of soil material in these experiments and experiments using short slopes with high slope gradients as a general rule when soil material is discharged by rain impacted flows sheet flow occurs and the area closest to the outlet contributes to the water discharged from the outlet during a rainfall event much sooner than an area further away from the outlet when water from the most remote point reaches the outlet and is discharged 100 of the watershed area contributes to the discharge in hydrology time of concentration is determined as the time needed for water to flow from the most remote point in a watershed to the watershed outlet time of concentration for runoff depends among other things on slope length and gradient and in most cases it is short in experiments where artificial rainfall is applied to inclined plane soil surfaces in the laboratory and many field experiments while surface water flows provide the transport medium for detached particles moving in rain impacted flows only particles moving in complete suspension move over the surface at about the same velocities as water in the flow coarse particles that move by saltation and rolling either raindrop induced or entirely flow driven move over the surface slower this is because they spend time resting on the soil surface between periods when they move in the flow lisle et al 1998 consequently the time of concentration for coarse sediment is longer than for runoff and is determined by the time needed for the slowest moving particle to travel from the most remote point in the eroding area to the outlet as indicated here that time depends on surface water flow conditions on the eroding area and the mechanisms moving the particles down to the outlet 2 detachment and transport in rain impacted flows it is well known that detachment the mobilization of particles held within the surface of the soil matrix can occur through the expenditure of raindrop and flow energy in flows not impacted by raindrops flows must exceed a critical flow condition below which no detachment by flow occurs however raindrops impacting flows less than about 3 drop diameters deep can detach soil particles when that critical flow condition has not been exceeded for erosion to occur particles need to be moved away from the site of detachment in rain impacted flows coarse material particularly sand and aggregates can move by raindrop induced saltation ris raindrop induced rolling rir flow driven saltation fds and flow driven rolling fdr kinnell 2012 flows have an inherent ability to transport soil material by flow driven saltation and rolling once flows exceed certain critical flow conditions that are dependent on particle size and density before those critical conditions are met coarse material can move by raindrop driven saltation and rolling whenever detachment occurs either by the expenditure raindrop or flow energy fine material moves in complete suspension fig 1 provides a schematic of how the various detachment and transport mechanisms are influenced when the shear stress is used as a measure of the inherent ability of the flow to detach and transport soil material fig 2 provides a schematic of the spatial distribution of the detachment and transport mechanisms that may operate as flow conditions vary on planar surfaces when rainfall intensity slope length and slope gradient vary in experiments involving rain impacted flow when rilling does not occur in sheet erosion areas or interrill areas on short slopes with high gradient usually at the start of a rainfall event the surface has no surface water flowing over it and so splash is the only mechanism that can move soil material downslope fig 2a splash tends to move particles radially from the point of drop impact and net downslope movement results from more material travelling downslope than upslope while particles can be splashed over a wide area by a drop impact the efficiency of transport of detached material is low on low gradient slopes no net movement away from the site of detachment occurs on flat horizontal surfaces when surface water flows develop on the eroding surface soil material may be discharged in both splash and the runoff fig 2b the presence of the surface water layer influences splash trajectories so that splash transport tends to decline with flow depth this decline in splash transport tends to be compensated by an increase in the ability of rain impacted flows to transport detached particles over the downstream boundary moss and green 1983 as flow depths increase from zero sediment transport by rain impacted flows tends to dominate in the area near the downstream boundary fig 2c 3 particle travel rates associated with raindrop induced saltation and rolling when coarse particles move by raindrop induced saltation ris soil material is lifted from the soil surface into the flowing water by a drop impact and it then falls back to the surface under the influence of gravity while in the flow the soil particles move downstream with the flow and so fall back to the surface some distance from where they were lifted into the flow by a drop impact although the uplift of particles from the surface produces a cloud the process can be represented by the scheme shown in fig 3 in this scheme a drop impact lifts particles from an area that depends on drop size and flow depth to produce a cloud that has projected area that is greater than the area disturbed by the drop impact the material lifted from the soil surface moves laterally downstream a distance that depends on flow velocity and the time the particles are in the flow before returning to the soil surface that time varies with the size of the impacting drops the size and density of the particles and the height the particles a lifted in the flow coarse particles moving in rain impacted flow comprise of both primary particles sand silt clay and aggregates generally because of differences in densities aggregates travel faster by raindrop induced saltation than particles of sand of the same size particles that are induced to roll also travel limited distances from the point of drop impact because soil material contains a multitude of particles with different sizes and density numerous time scales influence the movement of coarse material by raindrop induced saltation consequently each particle size and density combination has a time of concentration associated with it particles travelling from upslope move downslope in a dispersed wavefront fig 4 this is because the footprint of the material that falls back to the bed is larger than the footprint of the area impacted by the drop and many subsequent randomly timed drop impacts are needed to move all that material from where it fell the dispersion of particles detached from a point on the surface means that a time gap exists between the discharges of particles of a given size and density detached at the same time by a drop impacting at the upslope end of the eroding surface because of this gap the time taken for the last and not the first of the particles of a given size and density detached by that drop impact at the upslope end to be discharged determines that actual time of concentration for particles of that given size and density when a drop impacts the soil surface under a flow mpd the mass of particles of size p lifted from the soil surface under the flow by a drop of size d has two sources loose material sitting on the surface is not attached to that surface and will be lifted into the flow before detachment from the surface of the soil matrix takes place because moving loose material uses raindrop energy the more the amount of loose material sitting on the surface the less raindrop energy is available for detachment consequently loose material provides a degree of protection against detachment and 1 m pd h m pd l 1 h m pd c where mpd l is the mass of loose material lifted by a drop impact when the layer of loose material completely protects against detachment mpd c is the mass of soil material detached when no loose material exists on the surface and h is the degree of protection provided by loose material sitting on the surface h varies from 0 when there is no protection to 1 0 when there is complete protection for particles of a given particle size and density to be discharged without stimulation by subsequent raindrop impacts the drop impacts must occur within the distance xpd of the boundary the area extending upslope a distance xpd can be termed the active zone any drop impacting within the active zone results in sediment being discharged over the downstream boundary without stimulation by subsequent raindrop impacts because many particle sizes and densities exist in the material being transported numerous active zones operate simultaneously on surfaces when raindrop induced saltation occurs when drop impacts occur before runoff loose material is deposited on the surface by splash so that h 0 can occur when runoff commences the movement of soil material from upslope into the active zone usually causes loose material in the active zone to increase with time and as a result mpd l can completely dominate mpd in addition the composition of the layer of loose particles coarsens with time as the slow moving large particles detached upslope migrate over the surface ultimately when the particles being transported are stable the particle size distribution will tend towards that of the original soil even though the particle size distribution of the loose material is coarser than the original soil this occurs because of active zones for the smaller less dense particles moving by raindrop induced saltation extend upslope further than for the larger more dense particles for example if xpd for a less dense particle is twice that of another more dense particle then twice as many impacts in the active zone for the less dense particle generate the discharge of the less dense particles than the more dense particles generally the steady state occurs when the sediment enrichment ratio for all the actual particle sizes in the sediment is 1 0 and that will not be achieved if the duration of the experiment is not long enough fig 5 the sediment enrichment ratio is the ratio of the proportion of particles of a given size in the sediment and the proportion of the particles of that size in the original soil normally particle size data for soils is produced by dispersing soil material into primary components sediment enrichment ratios should be based on the measurement of the intact particles in the soil it is a mathematical fact that if the enrichment ratio for a particle differs from 1 0 then the enrichment ratio will differ for 1 0 in the opposite direction for one or more other sizes in order to compensate many soils produce detached particles that break down during transport asadi et al 2007 so that the enrichment ratio of 1 0 for all particle sizes actually being transported may not be achievable generally steady sediment discharge rates are seen as an indicator that steady state conditions occur when soil material is transported by raindrop induced saltation however when sediment discharge is controlled by raindrop impact induced saltation and rolling the slowest moving particles may be relatively few so that steady discharge rates may seem to occur long before equilibrium occurs true equilibrium many not actually occur in most laboratory experiments lisle et al 2017 experiments with sand and other stable materials have been valuable in demonstrating the factors that influence sediment transport by raindrop induced saltation the use of equipment such as shown in fig 6 under rainfall simulators producing mono sized raindrops has enabled the effects of rainfall intensity flow depth and sand size on the discharge of sand particles by rain impacted flow to be examined kinnell 1991 kinnell 1993b moss and green 1983 those experiments led to the empirical equation kinnell 1991 2 q sr p d a p i d u f h d where qsr p d is the sediment discharge mass flow width time of p sized particles induced by the impact of d sized raindrops impacting flows h deep flowing with a flow velocity of u id is the rainfall intensity of the rain with drop size d ap is an empirical coefficient that varies with particle size and density and f h d is a function that varies with flow depth and raindrop size as illustrated in fig 7 initially qsr p d increases with flow depth as it increases from zero before reaching a peak that varies with drop size before declining as flow depth increases further the effect of flow depth is two fold the absorption of drop energy in disturbing the flow reduces the mass lifted into the flow by each drop impact flow depth also influences xpd in very shallow flows the height to which particles are lifted is restricted by the shallowness of the flow so that tp d fig 3 initially increases as flow depth increases from h 0 at some drop size dependent flow depth the loss of energy in disrupting the flow becomes the factor restricting the height to which particles are lifted beyond that depth qsr p d decreases as flow depth increases f h d accounts for both the effect of flow depth on the mass lifted into the flow and tp d for sand particles varying from 0 1 mm to 0 9 mm ap varies by a factor of 4 6 over the 0 1 mm to 0 9 mm range in sand size kinnell 2009 eq 1 provides the capacity to apply the scheme shown in fig 3 to qualitatively model the effect of raindrop detachment and raindrop induced saltation in experiments using the apparatus shown fig 6 the scheme shown in fig 3 is relevant to 2 7 mm raindrop impacting 7 mm deep flows when the drops are travelling at or near terminal velocity and 0 46 mm sand particles spend 0 2 s moving downstream at the velocity of the flow after being mobilized by a drop impact kinnell 2006 fig 8 shows how the discharge of the 0 46 mm sand particles varies in flows with velocities of 10 mm s 1 and 100 mm 1 over both non cohesive and cohesive surfaces 500 mm long when the rain with only 2 7 mm drops has an intensity of 60 mm h 1 the model was also applied to the transport of fine sediment moving in complete suspension over the surface at the same velocity of the flow when cohesive surfaces occurred fig 8a and b show the discharges when the model was applied to the situation where the susceptibility of the cohesive surface remained constant with time for the fine sediment the time of concentration varies from 5 s when the flow velocity is 100 mm s 1 to 50 s when the flow velocity is 10 mm s 1 when the non cohesive surface erodes the sediment discharge of the 0 46 mm sand is generally constant over time short term variations occur because of the random spatial distribution of drop impacts used in the model however when the cohesive surface erodes the discharge of the coarse material when mpd c remains constant throughout the event increases with time to reach the same rates as when the non cohesive surface erodes fig 8a and b the steady rates are achieved sooner with the 10 mm s 1 flow velocity than when the flow velocity is 100 mm h 1 this is because the slower rate of travel of the 0 46 mm sand across the surface encourages more rapid development of the layer of coarse material towards that where full protection against detachment occurs at the downstream end the decline in the discharge of fine material is caused by the temporal and special increase in the protection provided by the coarse layer the model was also applied to the case where the amount of material detached by a drop impact declined with time according to the equation 3a m pd c t m pd c exp 0 332 t t 10 min 3b m pd c t m pd c exp 3 32 t 10 min where t min is the time from the start of the rain kinnell 2006 mpd c 10 0 04 mpd c eq 3 is used to mimic the change in susceptibility to detachment caused by crusting when the flow velocity is 10 mm s 1 the discharge of the 0 46 mm sand fig 8c is similar to that produced when the susceptibility to detachment remained constant fig 8a however it takes longer for the discharge of the 0 46 mm sand to become steady than when the susceptibility to detachment remains constant in contrast the discharge of the 0 46 mm sand when the flow was 100 mm s 1 over the surface where the susceptibility of detachment declines with time reaches a peak after about 10 min before declining to become steady after about 20 min fig 8d the peak discharge is considerably less than the steady discharge achieved with the non cohesive surface in this case the cohesive layer does not provide complete protection at the downstream end when soil is used in the equipment shown in fig 6 eq 2 is replaced by 4 q sr s d a s i d u f h d where s stands for a given soil kinnell 2013 in these circumstances as can be considered as an index of the erodibility of the soil surface it has been observed that the f h d flow depth relationships obtained for sand also apply to soils even though those relationships were obtained for only non cohesive surfaces as is an empirical factor that is influenced by the susceptibility of the soil surface to detachment and the sizes and densities of the particles being transported but eq 4 has no provision to take direct account of particle sizes and densities on sediment discharges the soil material moving in the flow comprises of both primary particles and aggregates and aggregates are completely disintegrated in the procedures normally used to determine soil particle size consequently data normally collected on physical and chemical properties of soils do not usually provide information useful to predicting as also the design of the equipment does not facilitate the collection of temporal variations in sediment discharge such as those obtained by modelling the detachment and transport mechanisms fig 8 consequently the results obtained for a given soil may vary depending on the duration of the rainfall event and flow velocities used in the experiment this is illustrated in by the average discharge rates of 0 46 mm sand for rainfall durations of 10 20 and 30 min and over the last 10 min shown in table 1 in the cases where the flow velocity is 10 mm s 1 the average discharge rates of the sand increase with rainfall duration and are highest during the last 10 min the same applies for average discharges of the sand for 100 mm s 1 flows when mpd c remains constant but they decline with duration when mpd c declines with time and the lowest discharge rates occur during the last 10 min as noted by walker et al 1978 and evident from fig 5 coarse and very coarse sand that is induced to roll can move quite rapidly in rain impacted flows over smooth surfaces parsons et al 1998 undertook experiments with unconstrained 2 88 mm to 10 63 mm gravel particles induced to move in rain impacted flows on a fixed bed of sand 1 mm 2 mm inclined at between 3 5 and 10 and measured the distance travelled in 15 min they suggested that the product of particle mass and transport rate varied with the product of rainfall kinetic energy to a power greater than 2 0 and runoff kinetic energy to a power near 1 0 little work has been done to develop models that can deal appropriately with the effects and interactions between particles size shape and density and surface roughness on the movement of particles that roll in rain impacted flows 4 raindrop detachment and flow driven transport as noted above very fine material detached by raindrop impact travels in complete suspension in the flow as flows travel downslope they may gain the ability to transport soil material by flow driven saltation and rolling fig 2d kinnell 2009 presented a qualitative model that simulated sediment transport by both raindrop induced and flow driven saltation on inclined slopes 2 m to 30 m long raindrop induced saltation was modelled using the scheme shown in fig 3 flow velocities along the inclined planes were modelled using kinematic overland flow moore and kinnell 1987 an equation developed by larionov et al 2006 was used to determine critical velocities for the onset of flow driven saltation fig 9 a shows the depths and velocities of the outflow modelled for 100 mm h 1 rainfall on a 2 m impermeable slope inclined between 5 and 55 together with the critical velocities for 0 46 mm coal and 0 11 mm sand when travelling by flow driven saltation particles travelled at velocities determined by govers 1989 fig 9b shows the discharges of particles travelling by raindrop induced saltation and flow driven saltation for the 2 m long slope using the qualitative model developed by kinnell 2009 when particles travel by flow driven saltation and rolling the upslope end of the active zone for the discharge of material detached by raindrop impact is effectively increased by the distance from the downstream boundary where flow driven bedload transport begins the increase in discharge of 0 46 mm coal when slope gradients exceed 30 results from that increase when particles travel by flow driven saltation it is assumed in the model that they do not contribute to the protection of loose material against detachment by raindrop impact consequently the value of h is less in at the downstream end of the eroding area when flow driven saltation of 0 46 mm coal occurs this results in an increase in the discharge of the particles that are still being discharged by raindrop induced saltation when slope gradients exceed 30 likewise an increase in the discharge of the particles that are still being discharged by raindrop induced saltation occurs when slope gradients exceed 45 when 0 11 mm sand is discharged by flow driven saltation it should be noted that while the model has been parameterized using empirical data the model is a qualitative model and the values shown in fig 9b are hypothetical however flow conditions can occur where all particles detached by raindrop impact are discharged by flow driven mechanisms that operate in the area adjacent to the downstream boundary as shown in fig 10 the transition from raindrop induced bedload transport to flow driven bedload transport has been demonstrated in experiments with poorly sorted sand in a 3 m long slope by moss et al 1979 5 aerial accession of detached material to rain impacted flows given the results of experiments on the effect of flow depth on splash transport such as those reported by moss and green 1983 it is generally acknowledged that splash transports detached material from areas where no surface water is present to areas where flows subsequently transport detached material downstream in their experiments comparing discharges of soil material in rain impacted flows and aerially by splash moss and green collected splashed material that passed in the air over the downstream end of the eroding surface shown in fig 6 moss and green clearly showed that the ratio of the material splashed over the boundary of an eroding area and the material discharged in the rain impacted flow varies with flow depth fig 11 is a schematic of the separation of the materials moving by splash and raindrop induced saltation in the moss and green experiments in this scheme material falling onto the rain impacted flow will move downstream as they fall through the flow in the scheme some of the splashed material that falls onto the flow adjacent end of the eroding surface will be discharged with the flow at the same time as material that did not become airborne this situation is not normally considered when data from experiments with rain impacted flows are analysed because the contribution of splashed material to sediment discharge by rain impacted flows is usually ignored recently experiments have been done where soil material splashed to slots along the sides of the eroding area was collected and measured wu et al 2019a 2018 zhang et al 2019 2018 the stated purpose of doing this was to measure detachment by raindrop impact under rain impacted flows on short slopes inclined at gradients greater than 10 wu et al 2019b this objective was not met kinnell et al 2019 because a not all the soil material detached by raindrop impact becomes airborne and b the material splashed to the slots contains not just material detached by the drop impacts producing the splash but also material detached previously however the material splashed into the slots provides a measure of detached material that falls into the flow from the air that is subsequently moved and discharged by the rain impacted flow theoretically the mass lifted into the air by a drop impact is given by 4 m pd a a m pd and the mass mobilised that remains in the flow 5 m pd f b m pd where mpd is the mass of particles of size p lifted from the soil surface under the flow by a drop described by eq 1 and a b 1 0 when the material lifted into the flow by a drop impact returns to the soil surface it is spread over a bigger area of the soil surface than the area disturbed by the drop causing the saltation jump fig 11 likewise the material lifted into the air by a drop impact returns to the soil surface generally it is spread over a bigger area of the soil surface than the area disturbed by the drop causing the saltation jump experiments on raindrop splash produced when raindrops impact surface water indicate that that area varies with flow depth that area is relatively large in shallow flows where b tends to be high b decreases with flow depth while h tends to increase in the downslope direction and with the ease of detachment but decrease with the flow velocity in very shallow flows sediment transport by raindrop induced saltation becomes severely restricted by the height of the water surface whereas the ability of drop impacts to cause particles to become airborne increases in the experiments using a clayey loessal soil in a 0 8 m long surface inclined various gradients between 12 3 and 46 6 under rain with intensities ranging from 42 mm h 1 to 90 mm h 1 zhang et al 2019 observed after a period of no runoff where splash erosion generated loose material on the soil surface the rates material was collected in the slots decreased with time to reach a steady rate within the 40 min duration of the experiments however for the 42 mm h 1 and 60 mm h 1 rain sediment discharges by rain impacted flows initially increased before reaching a peak and declining as time progressed fig 12 in contrast sediment discharges for 90 mm h 1 rains on the 25 degree slope declined with time right from the start of runoff altogether what takes place to influence the amounts of material splashed and discharged in the flow is complex further research into the mechanisms that operate on slopes with very shallow flows on high gradient is warranted 6 flow detachment and flow driven transport as noted above flow conditions can occur where all particles detached by raindrop impact are discharged by flow driven mechanisms that operate in the area adjacent to the downstream boundary once flow conditions occur that enable flows to detach soil material from the surface of the soil matrix without the aid of raindrop impact it is possible that in very shallow flows both raindrop detachment and flow detachment can occur in the area adjacent to the downstream boundary at the same time fig 2e under those circumstances all particles discharged over the downstream boundary are transported over the boundary by flow driven transport mechanisms irrespective of whether they are detached by raindrop impact or flow shear the occurrence of both raindrop detachment and flow detachment together in the area adjacent to the downstream boundary leads to an increase in sediment discharge but often rilling is initiated when flow detachment at the downstream end the migration of rills in the upslope direction leads to sediment discharge being dominated by soil particles that have been detached by flow shear this tends to result in particle size distributions matching those in the original soil kiani harchegani et al 2018 differences in particle composition for interrill and rill sources have also been observed by greenwood and zhang 2020 it is generally recognised that sediment entering rills from interrill areas can reduce the detachment capacity of flow within rills liebenow et al 1990 7 discussion as noted above frequently experiments under artificial rain often involve the use of planar soil surfaces of some given length inclined some particular gradient exposed to rain of an intensity that will lead to runoff occurring during the experiment often a period of time with no runoff occurs at the beginning of the rainfall event and raindrop detachment with splash transport will operate over the whole of the eroding surface rd st fig 2a historically considerable interest in splash erosion was generated by the understanding that raindrop impact was a major contributor to the initiation of soil erosion that followed work by ellison 1944 this led to the use of splash cups containing sand to measure the erosive effect of rainfall bisal 1950 1960 geißler et al 2010 scholten et al 2011 although exposing sand in a small circular container appears to be a simple way to measure the erosive effect time is a factor initially the sand surface is smooth and flush with the cup rim raindrops impacting near the rim not only splash particles but push sand over the side of the cup kinnell 1974 this results in high losses being recorded when splash cups are weighed to measure oven dried sand before and after rain also the rate of splash loss changes as the surface becomes pitted later splash can be intercepted by the inside wall of the cup as the sand surface falls some distance below the rim factors such as sand size and moisture suction sloneker et al 1976 also influence losses of sand from splash cups in most cases rainfall intensities produced by artificial rainfall cause ponding to occur in splash cups containing soil the development of a layer of water on the surface affects splash trajectories ghadiri 2004 ghadiri and payne 1988 mutchler and hansen 1970 so that usually using soil in splash cups does not provide measurements of soil loss suitable for determining susceptibilities of soil to rainfall erosion raindrop impact can cause aggregate breakdown and crusts to develop on the soil surface the development of surface crusts has a major influence on detachment by raindrop impact before runoff changes in the physical properties of the soil surface generated by raindrop impact can also influence infiltration and the onset of runoff bissonnais and singer 1992 le bissonnais et al 1995 splash tends to transport detached material radially from the point of drop impact and splash more material upslope than downslope when the soil surface is inclined as a result splash can generate appreciable amounts of loose material on top of the soil matrix before runoff occurs when soil aggregates are stable runoff produced by rainfall is only generated when the rainfall rate exceeds the infiltration rate and the infiltration rate associated with a soil varies with soil moisture rubin and steinhardt 1963 tisdall 1951 once runoff begins water begins to flow over the downstream boundary initially the source of that flow is runoff generated close to the downstream boundary and only soil material detached close the downstream boundary is discharged by the flow when runoff begins as time progresses runoff generated further upslope adds to the runoff generated close to the boundary steady runoff rates under steady rainfall rates occur when a infiltration rates are steady and b runoff from the farthest point from the outfall is discharged as noted above fine material detached by drop impact and flow shear travelling in suspension will always be transported by the flow and about the same velocity as the flow once flow is initiated on the soil surface surface water flows provide a vehicle to transport not only fine particles but also coarse material when flows are very shallow the movement of coarse material by raindrop induced saltation is severely restricted by the distance between the soil surface and the top of the flow considerable amounts of detached soil material may become airborne so that both splash and transport in rain impacted flows operate at the same time in the same area fig 2b coarse particles travelling by raindrop induced saltation travel at velocities that vary with their size and density fine material moving in complete suspension travel faster than coarse material moving by bedload transport generally the variation in particle travel rates leads to the composition of the sediment discharge being dominated by fine material initially and becoming coarser with time until the steady state exists slope length is often considered an independent variable when analysing results from experiments using artificial rainfall but the effective slope length is shorter than the physical length before the steady state is reached failure to reach the steady state is often seen in experiments when the sediment discharge rate does not become steady before the end of the experiment while the effective slope length for runoff has stabilized frequently that is not the case for the discharge of detached particles in many experiments even if the effective slope length for sediment discharge has stabilized during the experiment analysing data in terms of average rates of soil loss or averages of a number of particle size distributions obtained during the experiment will produce results that are highly dependent on the duration of the experiment the results may be appreciable different if the duration of the experiment were different also the steady state particle size distributions are likely to be appreciably different from event based averages the consequence of assuming that steady state conditions exist when they do not is illustrated by results presented by zhang 2019 zhang presented results from experiments where 4 sections in 1 8 m long flumes were sequentially exposed to rainfall during 15 min periods during an hour where rainfall intensity and slope gradient remained constant the upslope areas were protected by a tarp in one treatment a screen placed 5 cm above the soil surface to provide sheet flow protected from raindrop impact was used in another treatment in the first 15 min of experiments lasting 1 h the bottom quarter of the flumes was exposed to rainfall produced by the rainfall simulator in the 2nd 15 minute period erosion by the rainfall occurred on the bottom half of the flumes three quarters of the flume areas was exposed in the 3rd 15 minute period with the whole area being exposed in the 4th 15 minute period in the first hour 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity was used in the 2nd hour the exposure sequence was repeated with 90 mm h 1 rainfall intensity and 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensity in the 3rd hour zhang assumed that the average sediment discharges g m 1 min 1 obtained during each 15 min were steady state sediment discharges although there was evidence that rainfall intensity influenced the measured average sediment discharges zhang observed that the average sediment discharges were linearly related stream power which is directly related to the product of slope gradient and flow discharge when rainfall intensity is held constant the direct relationship between average sediment discharge and stream power indicates that a direct relationship exists between the 15 min sediment concentration the mass of soil discharged per unit volume of water discharged in 15 min and slope gradient however fig 5 in zhang 2019 shows that the sediment concentrations at outlet in both the trap and screen experiments increased with elapsed time that figure provides evidence to dispute the claim made by zhang that his analyses were done when steady state conditions existed it also needs to be kept in mind that each 15 min event on a given section is in effect a pre treatment for the next 15 min event on that section consequently the results obtained during each 15 min period depends on what happened during the previous 15 min changing the sequence of rainfall intensities applied during the three hours eg high intensity first and low intensity last or changing the time of exposure from 15 min may produce quite different results hysteretic loops in sediment fluxes have been observed when rainfall intensities have been varied stepwise from low to high and back again cheraghi et al 2016 the fact that the results obtained for steady state rates of soil loss are likely to be appreciably different from event based averages is an issue that is relevant to the determination of interrill erodibility in the wepp model laflen et al 1991 wepp is a steady state erosion prediction model in the experiments used to determine interrill erodibilities in the usa steady soil loss rates from interrill plots were used elliot 1990 some experiments done to determine wepp interrill experiments by others do not conform to this for example in experiments reported by vaezi et al 2018 total soil losses produced during one hour of rainfall were used to determine wepp interrill erodibilties also vaezi et al 2018 and deviren saygin et al 2018 used 1 m long flat planar surfaces a design quite different from the interrill plots used by elliot 1990 the interrill plots used in the wepp experiments in the usa were designed to be relevant to erosion in areas where ridge tillage cultivation was practised these plots were 500 mm wide and 750 mm long with sides sloping approximately 50 towards a metal longitudinal channel in the centre consequently the flow length on each plane was about 250 mm the wepp experiments in the usa also collected runoff and soil loss from flat planar plots 750 mm long and 500 mm wide elliot 1990 but these were installed to determine infiltration not erodibility kinnell 1993a showed that interrill erodibilities determined using these flat plots differed appreciably from the ones determined using the interrill plots arguably the differences between the erodibilities obtained for the interrill plots and the infiltration plots were caused by differences in the depth and velocities of the flows that occurred on the eroding surfaces wepp is designed to predict soil loses from ridge tillage agriculture and experiments to parameterize the model need to use plot designs that are appropriate to this outcome wepp can be calibrated to predict soil losses from rainstorms on planar usle type plots that are 20 m long or more but the predictions can be less reliable than predicted by the usle m kinnell 2017 the usle m is an event version of the usle kinnell and risse 1998 slope length is not considered as an independent variable in the prediction of interrill erosion by wepp the basic form of interrill erosion model in wepp is 6 d i k i i s f r where di is the erosion rate mass area time ki is the interrill erodibility i is rainfall intensity sf is the wepp slope gradient factor r is runoff rate zhang and wang 2017 conducted experiments where a soil with 39 sand 45 silt and 16 clay in surfaces with lengths ranging from 0 4 m to 2 0 m inclined at gradients ranging from 17 6 to 57 7 were exposed to rain with intensities ranging from 40 to 170 mm h 1 for one hour from the apparent steady sediment discharges obtained during the last 30 min in these experiments zhang and wang proposed that 6 d i k i i s f r a l b where l is slope length and a and b are empirical constants for the soil used in their experiments ki a and b were 132 9 0 242 and 0 137 in comparison a 1 and b 0 in wepp interrill model so that the equation proposed by zhang and wang 2017 indicates that for the soil they used runoff rate vol area time was not as effective in influencing interrill erosion as indicated by the wepp interrill model in generating and parameterizing eq 6 zhang and wang 2017 took no account of the sequence of detachment and transport mechanisms that operated in their experiments they state that generally no rill erosion initiated during the 60 min event early signs of rill initiation with small scouring holes were observed near the rainfall end in a few events this indicates that the situation depicted in fig 2e occurred in some of their experiments it is not clear exactly which of the other situations depicted in fig 2 occurred in the individual experiments but variations in the sequences of detachment and transport mechanisms operating on the eroding surfaces as rainfall intensity slope length and slope gradient varied may have influenced the results that generated eq 6 many experiments do not focus on a particular model of rainfall erosion but often the focus is on developing an empirical equation for event soil loss with rainfall intensity slope length and slope gradient as independent variables in some cases flow shear stress stream power and unit steam power are used zhang et al 2018 these variables all focus on slope gradient and either flow depth or flow discharge or flow velocity and are often considered without due regard as to the possible influence these hydraulic factors may actually have on soil loss as indicated above even if the effective slope length for sediment discharge has stabilized during the experiment the parameterization of the emperical equation will depend on the duration of the experiment different results are likely to occur if the experiment is repeated using a different duration also for the same set of rainfall intensities slope lengths and slope gradients the sequence of detachment and transport mechanisms fig 2 that operate using a different soil may be quite different this is illustrated by comparing the results presented by zhang et al 2019 with those presented by wu et al 2018 contrary to the results shown in fig 12 sediment discharges for the soil used by wu et al continued to increase with time over the whole of the 40 min event equations developed for the effect of factors such as rainfall intensity slope length and gradient on soil loss in an experiment tend specific to that experiment because different soils can behave quite differently under the same set of imposed conditions the lack of influence of slope length on short slopes with high slope gradient contrasts to the effects of slope length obtained when rain impacted flows operate on soils on longer slopes with lower gradients under natural rainfall in the field as noted above in relation to erodibilities obtained for wepp interrill and infiltration plots short lengths and high gradients produce flow conditions that differ considerably to those that occur on longer lengths and lower gradients in particular very shallow flows impose severe restrictions on sediment transport by raindrop driven saltation while high flow velocities favour flow driven bedload transport in their experiments zhang and wang 2017 reported flow depths ranging from 0 04 to 0 16 mm and velocities ranging from 46 to 269 mm s 1 in contrast generally sheet flows are several millimetres deep on longer surfaces with lower gradients there are experiments where artificial rainfall applied to planar areas generated rills after a period of time where sheet erosion occurred berger et al 2010 greenwood and zhang 2020 kiani harchegani et al 2018 qin et al 2018 shen et al 2016 shi et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 in these experiments interrill erosion contributes soil material to flow driven transport processes that operate in the rills rill flows are known to have a limited capacity to transport soil material so that the capacity for rill flows to detach and transport soil material within the rill can be reduced by the amount of sediment entering the rill from interrill areas while shallow flows may occur in interrill areas that occur on these plots generally flow velocities are much lower than on steep slopes consequently experiments on short steep slopes are not particularly useful in determining what contribution interrill erosion makes to the sediment discharged by rills on planar slopes the situation where both flow driven detachment and rainfall driven detachment operate simultaneously has been studied in experiments where surface water flow are generated by both rain and water input at the upslope end of the planar surface wen et al 2015 in experiments reported by singer and walker 1983 a soil with 13 9 2 µm 36 1 2 20 µm 18 8 20 50 µm 4 3 50 100 µm 8 9 100 250 µm and 18 0 250 2000 µm in a 3 m flume inclined 9 at was subjected to combinations of inflow and rainfall in addition to inflow alone and rainfall alone for 30 min two rainfall rates 50 100 mm h 1 and an inflow rate equivalent to a runoff rate of 100 mm h 1 were used beds exposed to rainfall or a combination of rainfall and inflow were not saturated by the end of the experiments and were crusted beds exposed to inflow alone were saturated before 30 min had passed showed no sign of a seal and there was evidence of minor rilling differences in surface condition between when erosion is caused by flow alone and by rain impacted flow must be taken into account when analysing experiments like these arguably it would be more appropriate to apply the inflow alone treatment after surfaces have been exposed to rain impacted flows some temporal variations in soil loss rates occurred but 50 mm h 1 rains with 100 mm h 1 inflows produced soil loss rates that averaged 3 7 times those produced by 50 mm h 1 rain alone 100 mm h 1 rains produced 3 6 times the 50 mm h 1 alone soil loss rates while the 100 mm h 1 rains with 100 mm h 1 inflow produced 7 85 times the 50 mm h 1 alone soil loss rates given that flow depths and velocities varied between the rain and flow combinations it is not possible to determine what if any detachment by flow shear contributed to the soil losses measured experiments like these in other experiments designed to investigate the effects of detachment by raindrop impact and flow shear experiments have been undertaken where soil losses produced by artificial rainfall have been compared with losses produced when flows are protected from raindrop impact by fine netting screens placed above the eroding surface for example lu et al 2016 use a 1 mm aperture nylon screen suspended 10 cm above an 8 m long planar surface using two gradients 8 7 17 6 in experiments with 50 mm h 1 and 100 mm h 1 rains produced by nozzles 16 m above the eroding surfaces they assumed that comparison of the soil losses obtained for the artificial rain and the protected treatments enabled them to determine the soil losses caused by raindrop impact and caused by flow detachment separately arguably this assumption is not correct because of differences in the soil surface conditions under the two treatments lu et al note that the nylon net prevented surface seal formation and increased infiltration the movement of water through the soil surface not only affects flow depth and velocity but may also affect the resistance of the soil surface to detachment experiments on the effects of exfiltration on erosion by rain impacted flow an et al 2013 huang and laften 1996 wang et al 2020 need to consider the effect of the water movement through the soil surface on both the resistance of the soil surface to detachment by raindrop impact and flow depth and velocity in the rain impacted flows 8 conclusion erosion is caused by detachment of soil material from the surface of the soil matrix where they are held by cohesion and inter particle friction followed by transport of the detached particles away from the point of detachment it is well known that raindrop impact and surface water flow can be involved individually or together in causing erosion prior to surface water developing on the soil surface erosion is caused by raindrop impacting detaching and transporting soil material away from the site of detachment aerially by splash in flows not impacted by raindrops flows must exceed a critical flow condition below which no detachment by flow occurs before detachment by flow shear can take place however raindrops impacting flows a few millimetres or less deep less can detach soil particles when that critical flow condition has not been exceeded when surface water flows occur detachment and transport of soil material may occur by raindrop impact and splash transport rd st raindrop detachment with transport by complete suspension in the flow rd fs raindrop detachment and transport by raindrop induced saltation rd ris or by raindrop induced rolling rd rir raindrop detachment and transport by flow driven saltation rd fds or by flow driven rolling rd fdr flow detachment with transport by complete suspension in the flow fd fs and flow detachment and transport by flow driven saltation fd fds or by flow driven rolling fd fdr because flow conditions vary in time and space the mechanisms that control detachment and transport of soil material in the downslope direction vary in time and space as indicated in fig 2 the suite of detachment and transport mechanisms that occur on an eroding surface where rain impacted flows occur may vary with rainfall intensity slope gradient and slope length the transition from the transport of detached material by splash to transport by rain impacted flow is influenced by flow depth fine material is always transport in completer suspension irrespective of the detachment mechanism coarse material is transported by saltation and rolling the transition from raindrop induced transport to flow driven transport of coarse material is often considered to be influenced by flow shear critical value τc loose fig 1 the onset of flow detachment is often associated with a critical value of flow shear τc bound fig 1 flow depth has a major influence on detachment by raindrop impact raindrop energy is used in penetrating the surface water so that spatial and temporal variations in raindrop detachment result from variations in flow depth over the eroding surface soil surfaces are affected by the detachment and transport mechanisms that operate to cause erosion raindrop impact on surfaces not covered by can cause soil surfaces to crust and change the resistance of the soil surface to detachment associated with raindrop detachment followed by transport by splash the resultant changes in the susceptibility to detachment will influence subsequent detachment by raindrops impacting flow and flow shear coarse material loose material that results from splashed material falling back to the surface forms a non cohesive layer of material sitting on the surface of the soil matrix this layer provides a degree of protection against the detachment of material from the surface of the soil matrix by subsequent drop impacts detached soil material that falls back to the soil surface after being lifted into the flow by a drop impact also contributes to the non cohesive layer the presence of this layer together with the effect of flow depth on the ability of drop impacts to cause detachment causes detachment to vary in space and time under rain impacted flows particles that are discharged with the flow travel from the point of detachment at rates that vary with their size and density and the mechanisms that transport them the net movement of material transported aerially by splash varies with slope gradient and is very slow when slope gradients are low there is an increase in transport rate of coarse material when raindrop induced saltation and rolling occur on such slopes and a further increase occurs when flow driven saltation and rolling occur fine material travelling in complete suspension travels at about the same velocities as the flow consequently variations in the suite of detachment and transport mechanisms that operate on an eroding surface influence how fast particles of various size and density travel for the site of detachment to the point where they are discharged given that the steady state in not achieved until the slowest moving particle detached from the farther point from the discharge point is discharged the time taken to reach the steady state depends on what suite of detachment and transport mechanisms operate on the eroding surface most experiments with artificial rainfall apply rain at a fixed intensity for a fixed period of time prior to the steady state occurring sediment discharge and composition produced when rainfall rates are steady will vary with time consequently total amounts or average rates of soil discharged in experiments of fixed duration will produce results that are dependent on the duration of the experiment this needs to be taken into account when designing and analysing experiments using artificial rainfall to erode soils declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
