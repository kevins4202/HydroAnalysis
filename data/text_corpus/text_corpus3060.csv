15300,chlorination is a common method for water disinfection however it leads to the formation of disinfection by products dbps which are undesirable toxic pollutants to prevent their formation it is crucial to understand the reactivity of natural organic matter nom which is considered a dominant precursor of dbps we propose a novel size exclusion chromatography sec approach to evaluate nom

drinking water to consumers this seemingly straightforward day to day service results from many complex procedures the most ubiquitous health concern in surface water sources is related to microbial contamination making it vital to properly control to counteract this risk several treatment units act as chemical and physical barriers against pathogens and pollutants of which chlorination disinfection plays a key role dbps are the unintended outcome of disinfecting water with chlorination and are chemical risks to drinking water over 800 dbps have been reported jiang et al 2020 which can be classified as aromatic and aliphatic neither all dbps account for the same toxicological effects nor are they found in the same amounts which can differ notably nitrogenous dbps are reported to be more toxic than carbonaceous plewa et al 2017 however trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas are some of the most common dbps found at higher concentrations globally krasner et al 2006 zhang et al 2020 and are under regulations nom is the major precursor for dbps although its molecular composition and reactivity are not yet well understood wang et al 2017 nom treatability and reactivity toward dbps formation varies significantly because each water source has unique features with seasonal influences dependant on catchment characteristics and climate weather related effects or whenever bromides occur surrogate parameters such as dissolved organic carbon doc ultraviolet absorbence at 254 nm uv254 and specific ultraviolet absorbence suva are frequently used to quantify nom reactivity toward dbps formation although some water utilities find these techniques ineffective year round due to seasonal allochthonous inputs caused by climate and catchment changes ritson et al 2014 rosario ortiz 2014 wang et al 2017 considering the implications of nom in the production of safe drinking water more extensive characterization methodologies are required to gain a better understanding of its responsiveness to the generation of dbps linked to the inefficiency of treatment operations under changing circumstances health canada 2020 rosario ortiz 2015 sillanpää 2014 size exclusion chromatography sec has gained attention as a separation technique for nom weight fractionation and is useful for tracking nom removal effectiveness brezinski and gorczyca 2019 uv spectra can estimate activation of nom moieties ignatev and tuhkanen 2019 single wavelength bulk measurements at 254 nm have been a direct benchmark for conjugated double bonds and aromatic structures which are closely related to dbps formation limiting the information to a single wavelength and bulk measurements may miss relevant elements related to dbps formation mechanistic approaches based on photocatalytic production probe the formation of products with a lower degree of aromaticity and molecular weight mw presenting a higher absorbence at shorter wavelengths liu et al 2010 following this multi wavelength approach several spectroscopic calculations e g ratios slopes and indices have been proposed as novel dbps tracking indicators chen et al 2020 a diode array detector dad may benefit data acquisition at multiple wavelengths which is useful for further calculations overall coupling spectroscopy with sec could provide a usable method for exploring the reactivity of different amw nom fractions the main limitation of these spectroscopic approaches is their unique ability to detect chromophores leaving behind other non absorbing nom constituents such as biopolymers universal detectors should be an end to end solution however their universality does not provide insights into the chemical nature of nom fractions the sec combined with an organic carbon detector ocd overcomes these spectroscopic limitations by encompassing all organics in a sample lcocd a custom made setup developed by huber et al 2011 is the most widespread approach in which ocd and uv254 detectors are attached to provide adjunctive information discriminating between aromatic and aliphatic characteristics except for mw this further qualitative information bridges the gap between spectroscopic and

of sec brezinski and gorczyca 2019 the effect of nom specific molecular weight fractions on dbps formation under standardised chlorination conditions formation potentials fps has rarely been investigated korshin et al 2009 defined the absorbence slope signal asi to explore the correlation between amw fractions and thms yields awad et al 2016 modelled the relationships between nom characterised by doc uv vis fluorescence eem and apparent molecular weight amw using hpsec uv and thms fp and encompassed the effect of bromide recently carra et al 2021 presented multiple linear regressions amongst amw fractions lcocd and dbps fps revealing promising results regarding the capability of fractionation techniques for potential rapid risk assessment of water sources in this study the addition of commercially available equipment to the hpsec dad ocd method merged their deep multiwavelength analysis and universal detection capabilities to evaluate the possible correlations between these signals and thms fp the hpsec dad ocd configuration was used to clarify the effect of nom sec fractions on the regulated dbps fp model for three drinking water treatment plants operated by ens d abastament d aigua ter llobregat atl serving 4 5 million inhabitants for these facilities thms are the primary concern because haas are systematically below the regulated limits postigo et al 2018 possible correlations between surrogate parameters and molecular weight fractions of dom obtained by this novel hpsec dad ocd approach and thms fp were unveiled considering four regulated species i e chcl3 chbrcl2 chbr2cl and chbr3 and their sum correlation based predictions from these metrics are thought to be relevant and effective tools for dwtps to predict thms fp and tailor treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 drinking water samples origin and characterization parameters the samples were collected through the treatment processes of three dwtps in catalonia llobregat ptll ter ptt and cardener ptc fig 1 these dwtps supply water to the barcelona metropolitan area serving over 4 5 million inhabitants and are managed by atl valero and arbós 2010 by direct diversion ptll catches raw water from the llobregat river and has a treatment capacity of 3 2 m3 s owing to salt deposit mining activities in the upper part of the river basin high salinity issues are prevalent which requires an electrodialysis reversal edr desalination unit with a total capacity of 2 2 m3 s in the treatment train postigo et al 2018 valero and arbós 2010 which operated at 64 during the sampling ptt receives water from a system of water reservoirs connected in series sau susqueda pasteral along the ter river through a 56 km pipeline with a maximum treatment capacity of 8 m3 s postigo et al 2018 the fluctuating riverine regimes in both reservoirs make water characterization an ever changing task the ptc has a treatment capacity of 0 35 m3 s of water from the llosa del cavall reservoir ion exchange iex efficiency was evaluated in ptll and ptt using samples taken before and after flocculation i e unit operation 5 in fig 1 the iex resin lewatit s5128 was conditioned with repeated milliq washings until the a254 was less than 0 2 abs m for each litre of the sample 0 40 ml of resin was added and the mixture was agitated at 120 rpm for 30 min following iex testing catchment samples were subjected to coagulation flocculation jar testing jt with pax xl10 25 mg l and polidadmac 0 8 mg l as coagulant and flocculant respectively in ptll samples and pax xl10 22 mg l and starch

glass containers and stored at 4 c to avoid exposure to light rutinary dwtps measurements of total organic carbon toc conductivity turbidity ph and ion chromatography concentrations were performed for

chbr3 and total thms determined as the sum of the four species tthms following the formation potential tests thms fp were analysed according to standard procedures standard methods 5710 a by hs gc ecd as detailed in the supporting information 2 2 dom fractionation by size exclusion chromatography to enable inter procedure comparisons samples were analysed using two sec fractionation methods for lcocd the samples were shipped to the het waterlaboratorium haarlem the netherlands where they were analysed following the method described by huber et al 2011 the chlorinated samples were quenched with sodium thiosulfate before shipment 2 2 1 dom fractionation by hpsec dad ocd an hpsec dad ocd system was established to study dom fractionation using an agilent 1260 infinity ii hplc with a 1260 vial sampler coupled to a dad enabling uv detection during the whole sweep from 190 to 600 nm from which 206 240 254 350 and 380 nm were selected for further analysis the spectroscopic slopes between 206 and 240 nm s206 240 and 350 380 nm s350 380 were calculated as follows 1 s λ 1 λ 2 a λ 1 a λ 2 λ 1 λ 2 the hyphenated sievers m9 sec ocd was operated in turbo mode acquiring data every 4 s with 5

µm pl aquagel oh mixed m 7 5 300 mm 8 µm analytical columns from agilent after 400 µl sample injections the combination of columns covered a mw cut off from 100 da to 500 kda and provided a baseline of approximately 60 ppb doc the autosampler temperature was 4 c and the column oven temperature was 25 c the samples were filtered through 0 20 µm nylon membrane filters with no ionic strength adjustments made because additional buffer would be exchanged throughout the separation eliminating high salt concentrations that could increase hydrophobic interactions triplicates of each sample were injected with a variation coefficient of 3 5 system void volume determined with polystyrene sulfonate pss 77 kda effective mw of 80 100 da pss polymer standards service gmbh was approximately 12 35 ml elution time 16 60 min and the permeation volume determined with acetone was 27 27 ml elution time 36 36 min the size exclusion columns were calibrated with pss standards individual standards of humic and fulvic acid standards of the suwannee river 3s101h and 3s101f international humic substance society amino acids and organic acids covering mw values from 204 da to 77 kda see table si 4 2 2 2 hpsec dad ocd peak deconvolution and fraction quantification dom fractions in the hpsec dad ocd chromatograms were quantified by combining direct mathematical integration and peak deconvolution see fig si 1 the amounts of biopolymers mw 77 kda and low molecular weight lmw substances mw 200 da acids and neutrals were calculated from the area underneath the hpsecocd spectra using the trapezoidal rule the region of interest roi of integration was as follows biopolymers 10 8 17 min lmw acids 29 33 min and lmw neutrals 33 58 5 min between 16 and 29 min 10 kda to 200 da the doc signal was deconvoluted to differentiate peaks within the fractions of humic substances hs i at 19 min and hs ii at 20 min approximately 10 kda to 700 da and building blocks bb i 25 3 min and bb ii 27 7 min 700 to 200 da fig si 1 deconvolution of the signals was performed by finding the peak through first derivatives fitting gaussian peaks with a chi square tolerance value of 10 15 and r2 adj of greater than 0 95 retention times were fixed to reproduce the same deconvolution procedure for all samples with a maximum tolerance of 0 5 spectroscopic signal fractions a254 and spectroscopic slopes s350 380 and s206 240 were computed by deconvoluting the spectra from 10 8 to 55 min using the same criteria previously stated five representative peaks were found for the a254 s350 380 signals i e f1 f5 and six in the s206 240 signals i e f1 f6 table si 5 numerical integration and signal deconvolution were performed using origin pro version 2021b originlab corporation northampton ma usa 2 3 thms fp modelling and statistical analysis possible correlations between dom fractions tthms fp and individual species were statistically assessed by evaluating multiple linear regression mlr as follows 2 fp β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β n x n where βi is the coefficient corresponding to the different dom fractions xi to evaluate the models the adjusted determination coefficient r2 adj was calculated as follows 3 r adj 2 1 1 r 2 n 1 n k 1 where r2 represents the coefficient of determination n is the number of sample points and k is the number of variables used in the model analysis of variance anova test probability was also analysed with f 0 05 being statistically significant furthermore the models were simplified using a stepwise multiple regression algorithm and independent variables i e dom fractions that did not contribute significantly were eliminated to allow for a better understanding of the contribution of the dom fractions to thms fp the β coefficients of the simplified linear models were standardised sc as follows 4 s c i β i stnd deviation of x i stnd deviation of thms fp to ensure the validity of the predicted models both the normality and homoscedasticity assumptions of the residuals were tested using the shapiro wilk and brausch pagan tests mlr adjustments model simplifications and statistical tests were performed using r version 4 1 1 10 8 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 thms precursors removal trends the formation potential of the different thms congeners during the determination of total thms fp for the 21 analysed samples was summarised fig 2 and table si 5 to find distinctions amongst source water characteristics ptll samples presenting higher concentrations of doc 3 17 mg l and salinity 554 µg l of bromide and 189 3 mg l chloride exhibited higher thms fp values than the other source waters while high chlorinated thms were prevalent and high brominated compounds were not noticeable in ptt and ptc samples chcl3 was the minority compound in ptll where highly brominated dbps predominate chbr2cl chbrcl2 chbr3 chcl3 the fps increased with the reaction time major increases were observed particularly in the ptll catchment sample where tthms fp increased approximately 1 5 times over 48 h reaching the highest concentration after 72 h furthermore the increases in tthms fp for ptt and ptc were much more gradual as expected a decrease in the thms fp was observed concurrently with the decrease in doc concentration from either the concatenation of unit operations within the treatment process or by iex at the bench scale overall samples subjected to iex had higher doc removal and br reduction resulting in lower thms fp table si 3 furthermore edr led to a notable decline in tthms fp in ptll with final levels approaching those of iex treated samples 32 µg l compared to 39 µg l and 49 µg l when coupled with flocculation although the full scale edr performed the best the pilot scale edrs also yielded substantial reductions which were comparable to the iex tests yield representations of the different thms fp indicate the sample reactivities amongst conventional working operations flocculation reduced the reactivity most the reactivity of ptt and ptc was generally unaffected by the rest of the operational treatments however in ptll edr also produced notable reductions in toc 62 and bromide 82 table si 2 and table si 3 the combined iex and coagulation process reduced the reactivity of nom by approximately 30 towards the formation of tthms 30 6 for ptll and 31 3 in ptt these final values are comparable to previously reported results in reservoir waters of 18 µg mg doc finkbeiner et al 2018 3 2 characterization of dom fractions by deconvoluted hpsec ocd signals compared to the lcocd method the proposed method changed the chromatographic separation shows that a single semi preparative sec column in lcocd does not provide sufficient resolution for the dom fractions in the raw and treated waters to separate successfully in lcocd separation the first excluded fraction corresponds to the higher apparent molecular weight i e biopolymers which is clearly resolved from the rest of the primary doc fractions i e humics building blocks and lmw neutrals and acids peaks from this unresolved region are identified according to their physicochemical behavior and apparent molecular weight in contrast to standard injections and then the doc signals are mathematically deconvoluted and quantified huber et al 2011 although the different analytical techniques provided the same elution sequence of standard compounds table si 4 huber et al 2011 that is separation is ruled by the same mechanisms the resolution of humic substances and building blocks was enhanced in hpsec dad ocd these separation differences were observed in the doc signal profiles fig 3 for the catchment samples the full set of profiles is shown in figs si 3 and 4 for hpsec dad ocd separation and figs si 5 and 6 for lcocd while biopolymers can be easily identified in both separations humics and building blocks were recognized in the hpsec dad ocd chromatograms this new identification approach allows for a more accurate profile interpretation and comparison as evidenced by the different dwtp catchment samples where changes in these primary components were visible although an in depth analysis of the removal of the different dom fractions within the treatment process is beyond the scope of this study further insight can be uncovered into the efficiency of each unit operation conventional operation treatments such as flocculation mostly affected higher mw fractions humics and biopolymers reducing a 29 and 17 their reactivity towards tthms fp in ptll and ptt respectively see section 3 1 however edr accounted for a 54 of tthms fp decrease due to the reduction of humics 3 and bromide 82 whereas iex eased the removal of lower mw compounds such as building blocks and anions andersson et al 2020 the main issue is whether there are any possible correlations between the molecular weight fractions of dom obtained by this novel hpsec dad ocd approach both in terms of doc and spectroscopic measurements and thms fp of the four regulated species i e chcl3 chbrcl2 chbr2cl and chbr3 and their sum see section 3 5 3 3 characterization of dom fractions by deconvoluted hpsec spectroscopic signals following a review of the literature rodríguez et al 2016 yan et al 2012 and the evaluation of single wavelength spectra absorbence profiles at 254 nm a254 and spectral slopes at short s206 240 and long s350 380 wavelengths were further considered to test their thms fp modelling capabilities whereas s206 240 presumably provides information about the non aromatic fractions s350 380 could correlate with the aromatic components of dom allowing both slopes to cover a wide range of spectroscopic characteristics the lower range wavelengths i e those less than 250 nm and associated with the presence of aromatic carbon provide information about non aromatic compositions associated with dom including the contributions of fulvic acids and microbial biopolymers huang et al 2016 ignatev and tuhkanen 2019 korshin et al 2009 according to chen et al 2020 relatively long wavelengths i e those greater than 300 nm correlate strongly with the yields of some dbps species due to long conjugated chains reflecting the engagement of slow chromophores furthermore differences in separation methods can be observed when evaluating chromatographic a254 profiles for samples analysed by hpsec dad ocd most chromophores absorbed at 254 nm commonly attributed to aromatic structures in humic substances and coeluted at 18 22 min in ptll ptt and ptc this dom fraction represented 85 92 and 88 of the total area of a254 respectively compared to lcocd separation the a254 signal was present in the entire region of the doc signals excluding biopolymers the s350 380 signal according to the hpsecocd fraction assignment encompassed a range more similar to that of a254 matching the chromophore zone of humic substances hs i and hs ii 18 23 min differences in absorbence profiles were found between the ptll and ptt ptc samples particularly in both a254 and s350 380 at approximately 20 93 min where a peak was identified in the ptll samples but was undetectable in the ptt ptc samples fig si 2 the lower wavelengths showed a distinctive absorption profile with spectra spanning a wider time range fig 4 the s206 240 signal was weakest in the zone of aromatic chromophores of humic substances and was strongest in the range correlated with medium and low molecular weight fractions including the final tail of hs ii f4s206 240 at 23 min building blocks f5s206 240 at 24 5 min and lmw compounds f6 at 33 5 min inorganic compounds may affect spectroscopic signals at low wavelengths therefore they should be examined in the absence of secondary interactions between the solute and stationary phases sec retention is governed by the molecular size however anions eluted within 23 2 min and 25 0 min fig si 7 in hpsec dad ocd which corresponds to previous findings for nitrate szabo and tuhkanen 2010 the early elution of a divalent anion is also evident in the lcocd a254 profiles see si figs 5 and 6 for the anomalous a254 spectra of sodium thiosulfate quenched samples thus sec elution of anions under suitable conditions for nom assessment ph around neutral and low ionic strength occurred sooner than expected because of electrostatic repulsion forces although these secondary ionic interactions may be undesirable in the sec simultaneous information on organic and inorganic contents may be beneficial as an indirect measurement for assessing thms precursors a cross check of the principal inorganic species in the analysed waters table si 3 and their spectroscopic properties between 206 and 240 nm wavelengths birkmann et al 2018 narrows the possible s206 240 profile interferences in the dom assessment to nitrate and bromide according to the retention times of the bromide and nitrate standards fig si 7 the fractions f4s206 240 and f5s206 240 were influenced by their effects however the benefits and drawbacks of this simultaneous information on the organic content and anions i e bromide to model thms fp must be further investigated 3 4 thms fp modelling with dom fractions analysis of variance anova and mlr were used to explore the statistical significance and possible relationship between thms fp including individual congeners bulk surrogated parameters and different dom fractionation strategies such as lcocd and hpsec dad ocd as a first attempt the feasibility of modelling the full set of data from the three dwtps was examined however the simplified models obtained from the sec signals did not satisfy homoscedastic assumptions table si 7 likely because an explanatory variable accounting for unequal variance was omitted considering the raw water characteristics e g doc and bromide levels see table si 3 and prevalent thms a split of samples was proposed samples from the ptll where brominated thms species dominated were analysed independently of the ptt and ptc samples where chlorinated thms were prominent besides the first attempt 270 tests were conducted which involved bulk measurements for doc a254 and suva and fractionated doc and spectroscopic signals the sec models were simplified statistical assumptions were tested and the fitting quality was evaluated using adjusted determination coefficients fig 5 r2 adj penalizes independent variables that do not contribute to the dependant variable preventing over parameterization and resulting in high r2 from unnecessarily well fitted data when comparing the variations in the coefficients for r2 adj vs r2 in figs si7 and si8 increasing the number of predictors can be rejected as being responsible for fit quality the models that did not pass the statistical test of residuals i e normality and homoscedasticity were scattered fig 5 most failures were due to residual non normality which could be overcome by increasing the number of samples in the training set n 11 for ptll and n 10 for ptt ptc or by adjusting a non linear model although the influence of fp kinetics was regarded using three reaction times i e 24 48 and 72 h minimal differences were observed generally bulk a254 presented closer ties to fps than other bulk parameters whereas suva had the weakest associations amongst all the best adjustments for tthms fp were found regardless of speciation which reflects the contribution of the most dominant thms in each dwtp chbr2cl in ptll and chcl3 in ptt ptc the r2 adj values for the bulk parameters were comparable to those documented table si9 r2 adj improved when modelling fps with doc dom fractions a similar behavior was recently discussed by carra et al 2021 when assessing an mlr analysis for tthms and mw fractions reporting better correlations with fractionated dom following lcocd separation compared to bulk doc in this study hpsec dad ocd showed enhanced regression compared to lcocd correlations breakdown analyses of distinct thms fps were conducted showing the distinctive contribution of each species overall the tthms models provided better adjustments than those of individual species despite the sec approach accounting for a more refined speciation compared to bulk predictions spectroscopic models exhibited closer linkages than doc fractionated models except for the less prevalent species consequently fractionated a254 signal improved tthms and minority species correlations compared to bulk a254 furthermore the correlations between s206 240 and s350 380 presented a noticeable improvement compared to the bulk a254 predictions slightly enhancing correlations for individual thms the three signals account for different information although a254 and s350 380 overlap in retention times and are both related to aromatic moieties higher wavelengths i e 350 380 nm could reflect the engagement of slow chromophores involved in the formation of tautomeric ketones that are adducts implicated in dbps generation chen et al 2020 therefore differences in correlations could be anticipated because of the different mechanistic implications that the two signals would reflect in contrast s206 240 encompasses both organic and inorganic contributions as discussed in section 3 3 two hybrid models were proposed by combining the major intensity peaks of different signals to provide a more sensitive prediction the first hybrid model that combined the main absorbence signals in a254 and s206 240 a254 s206 240 included f1a254 to f4a254 from the a254 chromatograms and f3s206 240 to f6s06 240 from the s206 240 profiles table si5 the first a254 peaks correlated with the main humic substances and building blocks 10 kda to 700 da chromophores whereas the s206 240 peaks primarily covered the chromophores of the lmw range 200 da the second hybrid model was performed by replacing a254 with s350 380 s350 380 s206 240 considering fractions f1 f3s350 380 f5s350 380 and f3 f6s206 240 while s206 240 in that range 21 33 5 min represented non aromatic and inorganic compounds neither s350 380 nor a254 included non organic contributions as input although the slope spectroscopic models presented better correlation coefficients than a254 the hybrid models explained all the outlooks best the a254 s206 240 hybrid model for tthms and the individuals presented the strongest coefficients r2 adj 0 90 especially in ptt and ptc the s350 380 s206 240 hybrid model also presented high r2 adj coefficients however adjustments for ptt and ptc slightly decreased comparatively 3 5 analysis of dom fractions contributing to doc and spectroscopic thms fp models the analysis of standardised model coefficients sc for the best fitted models from doc and spectroscopic signals can reveal the role of primary dom fractions in the fp of tthms and thms species this a254 s206 240 spectroscopic model was selected to proceed further due to their main improvements regarding speciation fig 6 presents the scs of the simplified models obtained for the hpsecocd and the a254 s206 240 models fig 6 comprises a stacked bar chart representation with higher contributions of a given dom fraction being expressed by greater sc bar lengths although the information extracted from this modelling is far from a mechanistic approach it can provide empirical clues about the most available reactive fractions that could enhance formations of the different thms dom compounds eluted within humics and biopolymers were the most significant precursors of halogenated thms in drinking water samples spectroscopy revealed a strong contribution from the a254 fractions especially for chbr2cl which further supports the role of aromatic moieties during thms formation brezinski and gorczyca 2019 although no significant differences were observed between 24 and 72 h in the hybrid spectroscopic method a significant contribution of fractions in the aliphatic range f4s206 240 f5s206 240 was observed in ptll samples the contributions of dom moieties to fps appear to be halogen specific which is a factor linked to speciation the dominant high brominated thms chbr2cl for the ptt ptc cluster and chbr3 for ptll presented a different trend compared to the other modelled thms fp furthermore the coefficient significances flipped with other congeners and the building block fractions in the doc ptt ptc models exhibited a negative contribution to tthms and chcl3 but not for chbrcl2 and are primarily responsible for explaining chbr2cl fig 9 the spectroscopic model for chbr3 in ptll samples followed a similar trend with reverse contributions for f3 f4 and f5 from the s206 240 signal this observation supports the indirect contribution of the anions discussed in section 3 3 these patterns in high brominated thms match earlier reports brezinski and gorczyca 2019 furthermore the bromination degree may be influenced by factors such as the bromide chloride ratio and possible electrophilic substitutions in electron rich structures such as aromatic rings phenolic hydroxyls or double conjugated bonds typical of high mw hydrophobic fractions chowdhury et al 2009 ichihashi et al 1999 in the first stage disinfectants activated moieties and progressive bromide substitutions may occur depending on the availability and reactivity of these moieties therefore these phenomena could be explained by the behavior of these flipped fractions the negative contributions in the models could be explained by their specific role in enhancing the formation of particular thms for example the bb fraction did not promote the formation of chcl3 these fractions appeared to be a crucial precursor in the formation of chbr2cl in low brominated water samples from ptt ptc generally these negative contributions could also be related to the formation of intermediates converted into unmonitored dbps carra et al 2021 3 6 validity of the thms fp models for future observations for each individual thms and tthms fp the measured and predicted values were represented to evaluate the goodness of the predicted capacity of the suggested models figs 7 and 8 furthermore to cover the possibility of future observation predictions using the proposed models prediction bands were calculated assuming a probability of 95 the differences in bandwidth between doc and a254 s206 240 suggest differences in the prediction accuracy of each model in particular the hybrid model which presented narrower bands appeared to be more accurate than the doc model mathematically this is biased in part by the limitations of the analytic process itself the sensitivity and accuracy of the measurements and deconvolutions and in part by the variability of the sample used to develop the models a comparison of the bandwidths for the same model on both datasets revealed heterogeneity differences this is reflected in the prediction models for doc and a254 s206 240 where the adjustment bands for ptll were broader meaning the analysed samples presented higher variability between them compared to ptt ptc which had narrower bands to further test these models and cross validate our results two new samples of storage tanks from ptll and treated water from ptc see tables si6 and si7 were collected a year after the initial set test the time span between sampling campaigns led to a change in hydrological conditions which resulted in a redefinition of the scenarios although the mean values of the water quality parameters did not vary significantly see table si11 during the validation set sampling the end of the drought pre warning scenario was experienced under these conditions the ptll storage tanks were still partly supplied by an external desalination plant mixed with in situ produced water to meet distribution network demands the desalination facility provides water when the ptll supply is threatened during the validation sampling campaign none of the edr modules was functional operational controls of the edr modules are based on water quality parameters e g temperature amount of organic matter and salinity and ruled by an environmental decision support system that assesses these parameters to determine which working percentage represents the optimum to minimize the formation of thms godo pla et al 2021 changes in temperatures e g lower temperatures disfavoring thms formation were decisive for switching off the edr modules in the initial training dataset the dwtp operated with 64 of the flow diverted to the edr however in the validation sampling the edr was shut down and the gac filters the latest operation before the final disinfection fig 1 for ptc this end of drought pre warning translated into a reduction of half of the reservoir level compared to the sampling period approximately from 65 hm3 in 2021 to 35 hm3 in 2022 despite the low flow rates and simplicity of the treatment train no major operational changes were observed in the dwtp the same measurement procedures both the characterization and thms fp tests were performed as previously described the ocd fraction profile and quantification comparisons on the testing samples with the training dataset showed differences between scenarios tables si5 and si6 although the total amount of building blocks and lmw acids fluctuated minimally 10 of the variation biopolymers humics i and ii and lmw neutrals increased by 19 46 and 95 respectively in ptll this could be correlated with the simultaneous increase in f1a254 and f3a254 f5a254 related to more aromaticity because of the higher content of humic substances however building blocks were reduced by 41 and lmw acids the less variable fraction decreased by 20 in ptc whereas biopolymers lmw neutrals 71 and humics i increased 205 again in agreement with the increase in a254 signals changes in ptll bromide and nitrate levels up to 2 and 3 times higher respectively see table si3 were observed in the increasing areas of f4s206 240 and f5s206 240 although the tthms fp of the validation samples were in the order of the training dataset table si2 distinct thms distributions were observed for ptll chlorinated compounds were less prevalent than in the first scenario with being chbr3 the dominant species followed by chbr2cl chbrcl2 and non quantifiable chcl3 however in the validation sample for ptc prevalence was maintained as the more chlorinated thms were the compounds most present chcl3 chbrcl2 chbr2cl regarding bromide levels the ptll storage tank samples had a concentration of 0 39 mg l between the gac filtered sample 0 56 mg l and the treated sample 0 18 mg l of the training data set the levels of ptc treated samples were still below the quantification limit after characterization the thms were predicted using the proposed methods see fig 7 void symbols as discussed in sections 3 4 and 3 5 the tthms fp models presented better adjustments compared to speciation however as shown in fig 7 the doc predictions for ptll fell outside the prediction bands some confounding variables might affect the explicative variable of the models although they are not included as it may result from inorganics a254 s206 240 indirectly considers the effects of those inorganics due to their absorbence at lower wavelengths see section 3 3 explaining the best predictions for the tthms adjustments particularly in the case of ptll where high levels of bromide are a primary dwtp concern the bromide effect became clear when contrasting the predictions of chbr3 fig 8 a4 and b4 doc predictions did not meet the specified requirements but a254 s206 240 did however this effect did not seem relevant for the species in the ptt ptc this suggests that whereas both doc and spectroscopic methods could be equally suitable for predicting tthms dwtps about bromide related issues may selectively benefit from spectroscopic approaches that account for inorganic contributions as the models were created using a heterogeneous pool of samples the predictions remained accurate despite scenario changes although large fluctuations in the sample population e g seasonality or climatic episodes such as droughts or floods were not included in the original training dataset modest variability impacts were observed owing to the initial diversity possible methodological modifications such as refining deconvolutions or adjusting non linear models could be explored to improve and increase predictability in addition the proposed models are based on fps which are determined under controlled conditions e g time and temperature therefore they should be considered as approximations creating a historical data repository to increase the training data set and include seasonal fluctuations in the models would further strengthen the predictions finally predictive advantages can be extracted from the proposed models especially spectroscopic models but can also account for operational simplification predictions based on fractionated spectroscopic signals using hplc dad seem more efficient and accessible than using hplc coupled to an ocd for highly specialized applications 4 conclusions an in depth analysis of thms fp modelling was performed that uses hpsec dad ocd for dom characterization was performed including diverse typologies of raw and treated waters differences in water characteristics make it challenging to find the best pooling to predict thms fp the differences in amw the intrinsic properties of dom and the inorganic content were crucial characteristics although the models did not contain a forthright predictor such contributions were integrated in the proposed spectroscopic based model combining substantial intensities from a254 and s206 240 the amw fractionated signal doc and spectroscopic models improved correlations compared to single bulk parameters especially in hpsec dad ocd separation the standard coefficients of the models elucidate the contribution and significance of the fractions most involved in thms fp although some representative fractions converged in the studied dwtps such as biopolymers and humic substances other differences were noted such as the role of lmw acids in the llobregat water supply and of building blocks in the ter and cardener water supplies similar analogies were observed in the spectroscopic model this relevance allows the creation of a link between precursors and products opening the door to further targeted optimization of dom removal although a modest validation of models was performed proving their prediction ability a more robust model that includes largest data sets accounting for variable fluctuations and compositions is still needed further refined data treatment and principally involving deconvolutions could help simplify the predictors and account for other suitable models however this study represents a novel approach including spectroscopic sec separation to provide a less tedious alternative to track thms fp compared

drinking water to consumers this seemingly straightforward day to day service results from many complex procedures the most ubiquitous health concern in surface water sources is related to microbial contamination making it vital to properly control to counteract this risk several treatment units act as chemical and physical barriers against pathogens and pollutants of which chlorination disinfection plays a key role dbps are the unintended outcome of disinfecting water with chlorination and are chemical risks to drinking water over 800 dbps have been reported jiang et al 2020 which can be classified as aromatic and aliphatic neither all dbps account for the same toxicological effects nor are they found in the same amounts which can differ notably nitrogenous dbps are reported to be more toxic than carbonaceous plewa et al 2017 however trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas are some of the most common dbps found at higher concentrations globally krasner et al 2006 zhang et al 2020 and are under regulations nom is the major precursor for dbps although its molecular composition and reactivity are not yet well understood wang et al 2017 nom treatability and reactivity toward dbps formation varies significantly because each water source has unique features with seasonal influences dependant on catchment characteristics and climate weather related effects or whenever bromides occur surrogate parameters such as dissolved organic carbon doc ultraviolet absorbence at 254 nm uv254 and specific ultraviolet absorbence suva are frequently used to quantify nom reactivity toward dbps formation although some water utilities find these techniques ineffective year round due to seasonal allochthonous inputs caused by climate and catchment changes ritson et al 2014 rosario ortiz 2014 wang et al 2017 considering the implications of nom in the production of safe drinking water more extensive characterization methodologies are required to gain a better understanding of its responsiveness to the generation of dbps linked to the inefficiency of treatment operations under changing circumstances health canada 2020 rosario ortiz 2015 sillanpää 2014 size exclusion chromatography sec has gained attention as a separation technique for nom weight fractionation and is useful for tracking nom removal effectiveness brezinski and gorczyca 2019 uv spectra can estimate activation of nom moieties ignatev and tuhkanen 2019 single wavelength bulk measurements at 254 nm have been a direct benchmark for conjugated double bonds and aromatic structures which are closely related to dbps formation limiting the information to a single wavelength and bulk measurements may miss relevant elements related to dbps formation mechanistic approaches based on photocatalytic production probe the formation of products with a lower degree of aromaticity and molecular weight mw presenting a higher absorbence at shorter wavelengths liu et al 2010 following this multi wavelength approach several spectroscopic calculations e g ratios slopes and indices have been proposed as novel dbps tracking indicators chen et al 2020 a diode array detector dad may benefit data acquisition at multiple wavelengths which is useful for further calculations overall coupling spectroscopy with sec could provide a usable method for exploring the reactivity of different amw nom fractions the main limitation of these spectroscopic approaches is their unique ability to detect chromophores leaving behind other non absorbing nom constituents such as biopolymers universal detectors should be an end to end solution however their universality does not provide insights into the chemical nature of nom fractions the sec combined with an organic carbon detector ocd overcomes these spectroscopic limitations by encompassing all organics in a sample lcocd a custom made setup developed by huber et al 2011 is the most widespread approach in which ocd and uv254 detectors are attached to provide adjunctive information discriminating between aromatic and aliphatic characteristics except for mw this further qualitative information bridges the gap between spectroscopic and

regressions amongst amw fractions lcocd and dbps fps revealing promising results regarding the capability of fractionation techniques for potential rapid risk assessment of water sources in this study the addition of commercially available equipment to the hpsec dad ocd method merged their deep multiwavelength analysis and universal detection capabilities to evaluate the possible correlations between these signals and thms fp the hpsec dad ocd configuration was used to clarify the effect of nom sec fractions on the regulated dbps fp model for three drinking water treatment plants operated by ens d abastament d aigua ter llobregat atl serving 4 5 million inhabitants for these facilities thms are the primary concern because haas are systematically below the regulated limits postigo et al 2018 possible correlations between surrogate parameters and molecular weight fractions of dom obtained by this novel hpsec dad ocd approach and thms fp were unveiled considering four regulated species i e chcl3 chbrcl2 chbr2cl and chbr3 and their sum correlation based predictions from these metrics are thought to be relevant and effective tools for dwtps to predict thms fp and tailor treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 drinking water samples origin and characterization parameters the samples were collected through the treatment processes of three dwtps in catalonia llobregat ptll ter ptt and cardener ptc fig 1 these dwtps supply water to the barcelona metropolitan area serving over 4 5 million inhabitants and are managed by atl valero and arbós 2010 by direct diversion ptll catches raw water from the llobregat river and has a treatment capacity of 3 2 m3 s owing to salt deposit mining activities in the upper part of the river basin high salinity issues are prevalent which requires an electrodialysis reversal edr desalination unit with a total capacity of 2 2 m3 s in the treatment train postigo et al 2018 valero and arbós 2010 which operated at 64 during the sampling ptt receives water from a system of water reservoirs connected in series sau susqueda pasteral along the ter river through a 56 km pipeline with a maximum treatment capacity of 8 m3 s postigo et al 2018 the fluctuating riverine regimes in both reservoirs make water characterization an ever changing task the ptc has a treatment capacity of 0 35 m3 s of water from the llosa del cavall reservoir ion exchange iex efficiency was evaluated in ptll and ptt using samples taken before and after flocculation i e unit operation 5 in fig 1 the iex resin lewatit s5128 was conditioned with repeated

glass containers and stored at 4 c to avoid exposure to light rutinary dwtps measurements of total organic carbon toc conductivity turbidity ph and ion chromatography concentrations were performed for

chbr3 and total thms determined as the sum of the four species tthms following the formation potential tests thms fp were analysed according to standard procedures standard methods 5710 a by hs gc ecd as detailed in the supporting information 2 2 dom fractionation by size exclusion chromatography to enable inter procedure comparisons samples were analysed using two sec fractionation methods for lcocd the samples were shipped to the het waterlaboratorium haarlem the netherlands where they were analysed following the method described by huber et al 2011 the chlorinated samples were quenched with sodium thiosulfate before shipment 2 2 1 dom fractionation by hpsec dad ocd an hpsec dad ocd system was established to study dom fractionation using an agilent 1260 infinity ii hplc with a 1260 vial sampler coupled to a dad enabling uv detection during the whole sweep from 190 to 600 nm from which 206 240 254 350 and 380 nm were selected for further analysis the spectroscopic slopes between 206 and 240 nm s206 240 and 350 380 nm s350 380 were calculated as follows 1 s λ 1 λ 2 a λ 1 a λ 2 λ 1 λ 2 the hyphenated sievers m9 sec ocd was operated in turbo mode acquiring data every 4 s with 5

µm pl aquagel oh mixed m 7 5 300 mm 8 µm analytical columns from agilent after 400 µl sample injections the combination of columns covered a mw cut off from 100 da to 500 kda and provided a baseline of approximately 60 ppb doc the autosampler temperature was 4 c and the column oven temperature was 25 c the samples were filtered through 0 20 µm nylon membrane filters with no ionic strength adjustments made because additional buffer would be exchanged throughout the separation eliminating high salt concentrations that could increase hydrophobic interactions triplicates of each sample were injected with a variation coefficient of 3 5 system void volume determined with polystyrene sulfonate pss 77 kda effective mw of 80 100 da pss polymer standards service gmbh was approximately 12

humic and fulvic acid standards of the suwannee river 3s101h and 3s101f international humic substance society amino acids and organic acids covering mw values from 204 da to 77 kda see table si 4 2 2 2 hpsec dad ocd peak deconvolution and fraction quantification dom fractions in the hpsec dad ocd chromatograms were quantified by combining direct mathematical integration and peak deconvolution see fig si 1 the amounts of biopolymers mw 77 kda and low molecular weight lmw substances mw 200 da acids and neutrals were calculated from the area underneath the hpsecocd spectra using the trapezoidal

s206 240 were computed by deconvoluting the spectra from 10 8 to 55 min using the same criteria previously stated five representative peaks were found for the a254 s350 380 signals i e f1 f5 and six in the s206 240 signals i e f1 f6 table si 5 numerical integration and signal deconvolution were performed using origin pro version 2021b originlab corporation northampton ma usa 2 3 thms fp modelling and statistical analysis possible correlations between dom fractions tthms fp and individual species were statistically assessed by evaluating multiple linear regression mlr as follows 2 fp β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β n x n where βi is the coefficient corresponding to the different dom fractions xi to evaluate the models the adjusted determination coefficient r2 adj was calculated as follows 3 r adj 2 1 1 r 2 n 1 n k 1 where r2 represents the coefficient of determination n is the number of sample points and k is the number of variables used in the model analysis of variance anova test probability was also analysed with f 0 05 being statistically significant furthermore the models were simplified using a stepwise multiple regression algorithm and independent variables i e dom fractions that did not contribute significantly were eliminated to allow for a better understanding of the contribution of the dom fractions to thms fp the β coefficients of the simplified linear models were standardised sc as follows 4 s c i β i stnd deviation of x i stnd deviation of thms fp to ensure the validity of the predicted models both the normality and homoscedasticity assumptions of the residuals were tested using the shapiro wilk and brausch pagan tests mlr adjustments model simplifications and statistical tests were performed using r version 4 1 1 10 8 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 thms precursors removal trends the formation potential of the different thms congeners during the determination of total thms fp for the 21 analysed samples was summarised fig 2 and table si 5 to find distinctions amongst source water characteristics ptll samples presenting higher concentrations of doc 3 17 mg l and salinity 554 µg l of bromide and 189 3 mg l chloride exhibited higher thms fp values than the other source waters while high chlorinated thms were prevalent and high brominated compounds were not noticeable in ptt and ptc samples chcl3 was the minority compound in ptll where highly brominated dbps predominate chbr2cl chbrcl2 chbr3 chcl3 the fps increased with the reaction time major increases were observed particularly in the ptll catchment sample where tthms fp increased approximately 1 5 times over 48 h reaching the highest concentration after 72 h furthermore the increases in tthms fp for ptt and ptc were much more gradual as expected a decrease in the thms fp was observed concurrently with the decrease in doc concentration from either the concatenation of unit operations within the treatment process or by iex at the bench scale overall samples subjected to iex had higher doc removal and br reduction resulting in lower thms fp table si 3 furthermore edr led to a notable decline in tthms fp in ptll with final levels approaching those of iex treated samples 32 µg l compared to 39 µg l and 49 µg l when coupled with flocculation although the full scale edr performed the best the pilot scale edrs also yielded substantial reductions which were comparable to the iex tests yield representations of the different thms fp indicate the sample reactivities amongst conventional working operations flocculation reduced the reactivity most the reactivity of ptt and ptc was generally unaffected by the rest of the operational treatments however in ptll edr also produced notable reductions in toc 62 and bromide 82 table si 2 and table si 3 the combined iex and coagulation process reduced the reactivity of nom by approximately 30 towards the formation of tthms 30 6 for ptll and 31 3 in ptt these final values are comparable to previously reported results in reservoir waters of 18 µg mg doc finkbeiner et al 2018 3 2 characterization of dom fractions by deconvoluted hpsec ocd signals compared to the lcocd method the proposed method changed the chromatographic separation shows that a single semi preparative sec column in lcocd does not provide sufficient resolution for the dom fractions in the raw and treated waters to separate successfully in lcocd separation the first excluded fraction corresponds to the higher apparent molecular weight i e biopolymers which is clearly resolved from the rest of the primary doc fractions i e humics building blocks and lmw neutrals and acids peaks from this unresolved region are identified according to their physicochemical behavior and apparent molecular weight in contrast to standard injections and then the doc signals are mathematically deconvoluted and quantified huber et al 2011 although the different analytical techniques provided the same elution sequence of standard compounds table si 4 huber et al 2011 that is separation is ruled by the same mechanisms the resolution of humic substances and building blocks was enhanced in hpsec dad ocd these separation differences were observed in the doc signal profiles fig 3 for the catchment samples the full set of profiles is shown in figs si 3 and 4 for hpsec dad ocd separation and figs si 5 and 6 for lcocd while biopolymers can be easily identified in both separations humics and building blocks were recognized in the hpsec dad ocd chromatograms this new identification approach allows for a more accurate profile interpretation and comparison as evidenced by the different dwtp catchment samples where changes in these primary components were visible although an in depth analysis of the removal of the different dom fractions within the treatment process is beyond the scope of this study further insight can be uncovered into the efficiency of each unit operation conventional operation treatments such as flocculation mostly affected higher mw fractions humics and biopolymers reducing a 29 and 17 their reactivity towards tthms fp in ptll and ptt respectively see section 3 1 however edr accounted for a 54 of tthms fp decrease due to the reduction of humics 3 and bromide 82 whereas iex eased the removal of lower mw compounds such as building blocks and anions andersson et al 2020 the main issue is whether there are any possible correlations between the molecular weight fractions of dom obtained by this novel hpsec dad ocd approach both in terms of doc and spectroscopic measurements and thms fp of the four regulated species i e chcl3 chbrcl2 chbr2cl and chbr3 and their sum see section 3 5 3 3 characterization of dom fractions by deconvoluted hpsec spectroscopic signals following a review of the literature rodríguez et al 2016 yan et al 2012 and the evaluation of single wavelength spectra absorbence profiles at 254 nm a254 and spectral slopes at short s206 240 and long s350 380 wavelengths were further considered to test their thms fp modelling capabilities whereas s206 240 presumably provides information about the non aromatic fractions s350 380 could correlate with the aromatic components of dom allowing both slopes to cover a wide range of spectroscopic characteristics the lower range wavelengths i e those less than 250 nm and associated with the presence of aromatic carbon provide information about non aromatic compositions associated with dom including the contributions of fulvic acids and microbial biopolymers huang et al 2016 ignatev and tuhkanen 2019 korshin et al 2009 according to chen et al 2020 relatively long wavelengths i e those greater than 300 nm correlate strongly with the yields of some dbps species due to long conjugated chains reflecting the engagement of slow chromophores furthermore differences in separation methods can be observed when evaluating chromatographic a254 profiles for samples analysed by hpsec dad ocd most chromophores absorbed at 254 nm commonly attributed to aromatic structures in humic substances and coeluted at 18 22 min in ptll ptt and ptc this dom fraction represented 85 92 and 88 of the total area of a254 respectively compared to lcocd separation the a254 signal was present in the entire region of the doc signals excluding biopolymers the s350 380 signal according to the hpsecocd fraction assignment encompassed a range more similar to that of a254 matching the chromophore zone of humic substances hs i and hs ii 18 23 min differences in absorbence profiles were found between the ptll and ptt ptc samples particularly in both a254 and s350 380 at approximately 20 93 min where a peak was identified in the ptll samples but was undetectable in the ptt ptc samples fig si 2 the lower wavelengths showed a distinctive absorption profile with spectra spanning a wider time range fig 4 the s206 240 signal was weakest in the zone of aromatic chromophores of humic substances and was strongest in the range correlated with medium and low molecular weight fractions including the final tail of hs ii f4s206 240 at 23 min building blocks f5s206 240 at 24 5 min and lmw compounds f6 at 33 5 min inorganic compounds may affect spectroscopic signals at low wavelengths therefore they should be examined in the absence of secondary interactions between the solute and stationary phases sec retention is governed by the molecular size however anions eluted within 23 2 min and 25 0 min fig si 7 in hpsec dad ocd which corresponds to previous findings for nitrate szabo and tuhkanen 2010 the early elution of a divalent anion is also evident in the lcocd a254 profiles see si figs 5 and 6 for the anomalous a254 spectra of sodium thiosulfate quenched samples thus sec elution of anions under suitable conditions for nom assessment ph around neutral and low ionic strength occurred sooner than expected because of electrostatic repulsion forces although these secondary ionic interactions may be undesirable in the sec simultaneous information on organic and inorganic contents may be beneficial as an indirect measurement for assessing thms precursors a cross check of the principal inorganic species in the analysed waters table si 3 and their spectroscopic properties between 206 and 240 nm wavelengths birkmann et al 2018 narrows the possible s206 240 profile interferences in the dom assessment to nitrate and bromide according to the retention times of the bromide and nitrate standards fig si 7 the fractions f4s206 240 and f5s206 240 were influenced by their effects however the benefits and drawbacks of this simultaneous information on the organic content and anions i e bromide to model thms fp must be further investigated 3 4 thms fp modelling with dom fractions analysis of variance anova and mlr were used to explore the statistical significance and possible relationship between thms fp including individual congeners bulk surrogated parameters and different dom fractionation strategies such as lcocd and hpsec dad ocd as a first attempt the feasibility of modelling the full set of data from the three dwtps was examined however the simplified models obtained from the sec signals did not satisfy homoscedastic assumptions table si 7 likely because an explanatory variable accounting for unequal variance was omitted considering the raw water characteristics e g doc and bromide levels see table si 3 and prevalent thms a split of samples was proposed samples from the ptll where brominated thms species dominated were analysed independently of the ptt and ptc samples where chlorinated thms were prominent besides the first attempt 270 tests were conducted which involved bulk measurements for doc a254 and suva and fractionated doc and spectroscopic signals the sec models were simplified statistical assumptions were tested and the fitting quality was evaluated using adjusted determination coefficients fig 5 r2 adj penalizes independent variables that do not contribute to the dependant variable preventing over parameterization and resulting in high r2 from unnecessarily well fitted data when comparing the variations in the coefficients for r2 adj vs r2 in figs si7 and si8 increasing the number of predictors can be rejected as being responsible for fit quality the models that did not pass the statistical test of residuals i e normality and homoscedasticity were scattered fig 5 most failures were due to residual non normality which could be overcome by increasing the number of samples in the training set n 11 for ptll and n 10 for ptt ptc or by adjusting a non linear model although the influence of fp kinetics was regarded using three reaction times i e 24 48 and 72 h minimal differences were observed generally bulk a254 presented closer ties to fps than other bulk parameters whereas suva had the weakest associations amongst all the best adjustments for tthms fp were found regardless of speciation which reflects the contribution of the most dominant thms in each dwtp chbr2cl in ptll and chcl3 in ptt ptc the r2 adj values for the bulk parameters were comparable to those documented table si9 r2 adj improved when modelling fps with doc dom fractions a similar behavior was recently discussed by carra et al 2021 when assessing an mlr analysis for tthms and mw fractions reporting better correlations with fractionated dom following lcocd separation compared to bulk doc in this study hpsec dad ocd showed enhanced regression compared to lcocd correlations breakdown analyses of distinct thms fps were conducted showing the distinctive contribution of each species overall the tthms models provided better adjustments than those of individual species despite the sec approach accounting for a more refined speciation compared to bulk predictions spectroscopic models exhibited closer linkages than doc fractionated models except for the less prevalent species consequently fractionated a254 signal improved tthms and minority species correlations compared to bulk a254 furthermore the correlations between s206 240 and s350 380 presented a noticeable improvement compared to the bulk a254 predictions slightly enhancing correlations for individual thms the three signals account for different information although a254 and s350 380 overlap in retention times and are both related to aromatic moieties higher wavelengths i e 350 380 nm could reflect the engagement of slow chromophores involved in the formation of tautomeric ketones that are adducts implicated in dbps generation chen et al 2020 therefore differences in correlations could be anticipated because of the different mechanistic implications that the two signals would reflect in contrast s206 240 encompasses both organic and inorganic contributions as discussed in section 3 3 two hybrid models were proposed by combining the major intensity peaks of different signals to provide a more sensitive prediction the first hybrid model that combined the main absorbence signals in a254 and s206 240 a254 s206 240 included f1a254 to f4a254 from the a254 chromatograms and f3s206 240 to f6s06 240 from the s206 240 profiles table si5 the first a254 peaks correlated with the main humic substances and building blocks 10 kda to 700 da chromophores whereas the s206 240 peaks primarily covered the chromophores of the lmw range 200 da the second hybrid model was performed by replacing a254 with s350 380 s350 380 s206 240 considering fractions f1 f3s350 380 f5s350 380 and f3 f6s206 240 while s206 240 in that range 21 33 5 min represented non aromatic and inorganic compounds neither s350 380 nor a254 included non organic contributions as input although the slope spectroscopic models presented better correlation coefficients than a254 the hybrid models explained all the outlooks best the a254 s206 240 hybrid model for tthms and the individuals presented the strongest coefficients r2 adj 0 90 especially in ptt and ptc the s350 380 s206 240 hybrid model also presented high r2 adj coefficients however adjustments for ptt and ptc slightly decreased comparatively 3 5 analysis of dom fractions contributing to doc and spectroscopic thms fp models the analysis of standardised model coefficients sc for the best fitted models from doc and spectroscopic signals can reveal the role of primary dom fractions in the fp of tthms and thms species this a254 s206 240 spectroscopic model was selected to proceed further due to their main improvements regarding speciation fig 6 presents the scs of the simplified models obtained for the hpsecocd and the a254 s206 240 models fig 6 comprises a stacked bar chart representation with higher contributions of a given dom fraction being expressed by greater sc bar lengths although the information extracted from this modelling is far from a mechanistic approach it can provide empirical clues about the most available reactive fractions that could enhance formations of the different thms dom compounds eluted within humics and biopolymers were the most significant precursors of halogenated thms in drinking water samples spectroscopy revealed a strong contribution from the a254 fractions especially for chbr2cl which further supports the role of aromatic moieties during thms formation brezinski and gorczyca 2019 although no significant differences were observed between 24 and 72 h in the hybrid spectroscopic method a significant contribution of fractions in the aliphatic range f4s206 240 f5s206 240 was observed in ptll samples the contributions of dom moieties to fps appear to be halogen specific which is a factor linked to speciation the dominant high brominated thms chbr2cl for the ptt ptc cluster and chbr3 for ptll presented a different trend compared to the other modelled thms fp furthermore the coefficient significances flipped with other congeners and the building block fractions in the doc ptt ptc models exhibited a negative contribution to tthms and chcl3 but not for chbrcl2 and are primarily responsible for explaining chbr2cl fig 9 the spectroscopic model for chbr3 in ptll samples followed a similar trend with reverse contributions for f3 f4 and f5 from the s206 240 signal this observation supports the indirect contribution of the anions discussed in section 3 3 these patterns in high brominated thms match earlier reports brezinski and gorczyca 2019 furthermore the bromination degree may be influenced by factors such as the bromide chloride ratio and possible electrophilic substitutions in electron rich structures such as aromatic rings phenolic hydroxyls or double conjugated bonds typical of high mw hydrophobic fractions chowdhury et al 2009 ichihashi et al 1999 in the first stage disinfectants activated moieties and progressive bromide substitutions may occur depending on the availability and reactivity of these moieties therefore these phenomena could be explained by the behavior of these flipped fractions the negative contributions in the models could be explained by their specific role in enhancing the formation of particular thms for example the bb fraction did not promote the formation of chcl3 these fractions appeared to be a crucial precursor in the formation of chbr2cl in low brominated water samples from ptt ptc generally these negative contributions could also be related to the formation of intermediates converted into unmonitored dbps carra et al 2021 3 6 validity of the thms fp models for future observations for each individual thms and tthms fp the measured and predicted values were represented to evaluate the goodness of the predicted capacity of the suggested models figs 7 and 8 furthermore to cover the possibility of future observation predictions using the proposed models prediction bands were calculated assuming a probability of 95 the differences in bandwidth between doc and a254 s206 240 suggest differences in the prediction accuracy of each model in particular the hybrid model which presented narrower bands appeared to be more accurate than the doc model mathematically this is biased in part by the limitations of the analytic process itself the sensitivity and accuracy of the measurements and deconvolutions and in part by the variability of the sample used to develop the models a comparison of the bandwidths for the same model on both datasets revealed heterogeneity differences this is reflected in the prediction models for doc and a254 s206 240 where the adjustment bands for ptll were broader meaning the analysed samples presented higher variability between them compared to ptt ptc which had narrower bands to further test these models and cross validate our results two new samples of storage tanks from ptll and treated water from ptc see tables si6 and si7 were collected a year after the initial set test the time span between sampling campaigns led to a change in hydrological conditions which resulted in a redefinition of the scenarios although the mean values of the water quality parameters did not vary significantly see table si11 during the validation set sampling the end of the drought pre warning scenario was experienced under these conditions the ptll storage tanks were still partly supplied by an external desalination plant mixed with in situ produced water to meet distribution network demands the desalination facility provides water when the ptll supply is threatened during the validation sampling campaign none of the edr modules was functional operational controls of the edr modules are based on water quality parameters e g temperature amount of organic matter and salinity and ruled by an environmental decision support system that assesses these parameters to determine which working percentage represents the optimum to minimize the formation of thms godo pla et al 2021 changes in temperatures e g lower temperatures disfavoring thms formation were decisive for switching off the edr modules in the initial training dataset the dwtp operated with 64 of the flow diverted to the edr however in the validation sampling the edr was shut down and the gac filters the latest operation before the final disinfection fig 1 for ptc this end of drought pre warning translated into a reduction of half of the reservoir level compared to the sampling period approximately from 65 hm3 in 2021 to 35 hm3 in 2022 despite the low flow rates and simplicity of the treatment train no major operational changes were observed in the dwtp the same measurement procedures both the characterization and thms fp tests were performed as previously described the ocd fraction profile and quantification comparisons on the testing samples with the training dataset showed differences between scenarios tables si5 and si6 although the total amount of building blocks and lmw acids fluctuated minimally 10 of the variation biopolymers humics i and ii and lmw neutrals increased by 19 46 and 95 respectively in ptll this could be correlated with the simultaneous increase in f1a254 and f3a254 f5a254 related to more aromaticity because of the higher content of humic substances however building blocks were reduced by 41 and lmw acids the less variable fraction decreased by 20 in ptc whereas biopolymers lmw neutrals 71 and humics i increased 205 again in agreement with the increase in a254 signals changes in ptll bromide and nitrate levels up to 2 and 3 times higher respectively see table si3 were observed in the increasing areas of f4s206 240 and f5s206 240 although the tthms fp of the validation samples were in the order of the training dataset table si2 distinct thms distributions were observed for ptll chlorinated compounds were less prevalent than in the first scenario with being chbr3 the dominant species followed by chbr2cl chbrcl2 and non quantifiable chcl3 however in the validation sample for ptc prevalence was maintained as the more chlorinated thms were the compounds most present chcl3 chbrcl2 chbr2cl regarding bromide levels the ptll storage tank samples had a concentration of 0 39 mg l between the gac filtered sample 0 56 mg l and the treated sample 0 18 mg l of the training data set the levels of ptc treated samples were still below the quantification limit after characterization the thms were predicted using the proposed methods see fig 7 void symbols as discussed in sections 3 4 and 3 5 the tthms fp models presented better adjustments compared to speciation however as shown in fig 7 the doc predictions for ptll fell outside the prediction bands some confounding variables might affect the explicative variable of the models although they are not included as it may result from inorganics a254 s206 240 indirectly considers the effects of those inorganics due to their absorbence at lower wavelengths see section 3 3 explaining the best predictions for the tthms adjustments particularly in the case of ptll where high levels of bromide are a primary dwtp concern the bromide effect became clear when contrasting the predictions of chbr3 fig 8 a4 and b4 doc predictions did not meet the specified requirements but a254 s206 240 did however this effect did not seem relevant for the species in the ptt ptc this suggests that whereas both doc and spectroscopic methods could be equally suitable for predicting tthms dwtps about bromide related issues may selectively benefit from spectroscopic approaches that account for inorganic contributions as the models were created using a heterogeneous pool of samples the predictions remained accurate despite scenario changes although large fluctuations in the sample population e g seasonality or climatic episodes such as droughts or floods were not included in the original training dataset modest variability impacts were observed owing to the initial diversity possible methodological modifications such as refining deconvolutions or adjusting non linear models could be explored to improve and increase predictability in addition the proposed models are based on fps which are determined under controlled conditions e g time and temperature therefore they should be considered as approximations creating a historical data repository to increase the training data set and include seasonal fluctuations in the models would further strengthen the predictions finally predictive advantages can be extracted from the proposed models especially spectroscopic models but can also account for operational simplification predictions based on fractionated spectroscopic signals using hplc dad seem more efficient and accessible than using hplc coupled to an ocd for highly specialized applications 4 conclusions an in depth analysis of thms fp modelling was performed that uses hpsec dad ocd for dom characterization was performed including diverse typologies of raw and treated waters differences in water characteristics make it challenging to find the best pooling to predict thms fp the differences in amw the intrinsic properties of dom and the inorganic content were crucial characteristics although the models did not contain a forthright predictor such contributions were integrated in the proposed spectroscopic based model combining substantial intensities from a254 and s206 240 the amw fractionated signal doc and spectroscopic models improved correlations compared to single bulk parameters especially in hpsec dad ocd separation the standard coefficients of the models elucidate the contribution and significance of the fractions most involved in thms fp although some representative fractions converged in the studied dwtps such as biopolymers and humic substances other differences were noted such as the role of lmw acids in the llobregat water supply and of building blocks in the ter and cardener water supplies similar analogies were observed in the spectroscopic model this relevance allows the creation of a link between precursors and products opening the door to further targeted optimization of dom removal although a modest validation of models was performed proving their prediction ability a more robust model that includes largest data sets accounting for variable fluctuations and compositions is still needed further refined data treatment and principally involving deconvolutions could help simplify the predictors and account for other suitable models however this study represents a novel approach including spectroscopic sec separation to provide a less tedious alternative to track thms fp compared

15301,land reclamation is a major threat to the world s coastal wetlands and it may influence the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen in coastal regions conversion of coastal marshes into aquaculture ponds is common in the asian pacific region but its impacts on the production and emission of nitrogen greenhouse gases remain poorly understood in this study we compared n2o emission from a brackish marsh and converted shrimp aquaculture ponds in the shanyutan wetland the min river estuary in southeast china over a three year period we also measured sediment and porewater properties relevant functional gene abundance sediment n2o production potential and denitrification potential in the two habitats results indicated that the pond sediment had lower n substrate availability lower ammonia oxidation aoa and comammox nitrospira amoa nitrite reduction nirk and nirs and nitrous oxide reduction nosz ⅰ and nosz ⅱ gene abundance and lower n2o production and denitrification potentials than in marsh sediments consequently n2o emission fluxes from the aquaculture ponds range 5 4 251 8 μg m 2 h 1 were significantly lower than those from the marsh 12 6 570 7 μg m 2 h 1 overall our results show that conversion from marsh to shrimp aquaculture ponds in the shanyutan wetland may have diminished nutrient input from the catchment impacted the n cycling microbial community and lowered n2o production capacity of the sediment leading to lower n2o emissions better post harvesting management of pond water and sediment may further mitigate n2o emissions caused by the aquaculture operation

organization wmo 2021 showed that the global atmospheric n2o concentration has been increasing since 1750 reaching 333 ppbv in 2020 land use and land cover change lulcc is considered an important driver of anthropogenic n2o emission gutlein et al 2018 ipcc 2013 thus good understanding of the effects of lulcc on n2o emission from various ecosystems is essential for mitigating climate change tan

in china duan et al 2020 most of which were reclaimed from coastal wetlands by removing the original vegetation and converting the bunds into steep slopes yang et al 2017 this alteration of the landscape from vegetated areas with shallow free flowing water to isolated standing water bodies can strongly affect nutrient cycles sediment properties abundance and activity of n cycling microorganisms and subsequent n2o biogeochemical processes huang et al 2010 jiang et al 2009 roulet 2000 but long term data on the direction and magnitude of these effects are lacking to investigate the climate effect of lulcc ideally one should monitor n2o production and emissions from the location before and after the creation of aquaculture ponds however this is impossible for existing ponds as an alternative one may compare n2o production and emission from the aquaculture ponds and the surrounding native habitat to that end we compared n2o emission fluxes between a brackish marsh and converted aquaculture ponds in the shanyutan wetland southeast china over a three year period to explore the underlying factors that may explain the differences we measured sediment and porewater properties major n cycling functional genes sediment n2o production and denitrification potentials between the two habitat types across the shrimp farming season the main research objectives are to 1 investigate differences in the sediment n2o production and denitrification potentials and the relevant bacterial gene abundance between marsh land and aquaculture ponds 2 assess the effects of marsh land conversion on n2o emissions 3 identify the main environmental factors influencing the change in n2o emissions we hypothesized that the conversion of coastal marsh to aquaculture ponds would decrease the n2o emissions by changing the hydrological and edaphic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the shanyutan wetland 26 00 36 to 26 03 42 n 119 34 12 to 119 40 40 e is located

applied in coastal shrimp ponds in other regions in china and southeast asia herbeck et al 2013 kongkeo 1997 pouil et al 2019 xie and yu 2007 to assess the influence of land conversion on sediment n2o production and emissions from the shanyutan wetland a brackish c malaccensis marsh stand and three nearby converted aquaculture ponds were chosen for comparison sediment sampling and incubation were conducted monthly between april 2019 and january 2020 for a total of 10 times n2o emission fluxes were measured between april 2019 and december 2021 in irregular time intervals subject to covid 19

grouping the data a seasonal pattern emerged with lower emission fluxes in autumn and winter and higher fluxes in spring and summer in both habitat types fig 5b and c 3 5 environmental drivers of n2o productions and fluxes the correlations between sediment n2o production potential and n2o emission flux and the different biotic and abiotic variables are shown in fig 6 based on pearson correlations fig 6 and rfp analysis fig 7 the changes in n2o emission flux were strongly driven by nirk gene abundance n substrate concentrations e g tn no3 n and nh4 n and ts which together explained nearly 55 of the variations based on rda sediment salinity c n ratio tn and porewater nh4 n concentration were the main variables explaining the changes of sediment n2o production potential and n2o emission fluxes in marsh in particular c n accounted for the largest contribution fig s2a in the aquaculture ponds sediment n2o production potential and n2o emission fluxes were strongly driven by ts and c n ratio which together explained nearly 83 of the changes fig s2b 4 discussion large increases in n2o and ch4 emissions following conversion of natural wetlands to agriculture systems e g croplands pastures which have also been reported by other scholars e g gleason et al 2009 huang et al 2010 tan et al 2019 olsson et al 2015 are usually attributed to the increase in precursor substrates and changes in soil properties tan et al 2019 for aquaculture ponds application of fertilizer organic loading from feeds and farmed animals and oxygen depletion in waterlogged sediment are all expected to promote n2o production and emission hu et al 2012 mosier et al 1991 tan et al 2020 in china and elsewhere in the asia pacific region conversion of natural wetlands to aquaculture ponds is widespread to satisfy the growing food demand raising concerns about their climate impact yuan et al 2019 strokal et al 2021 by comparing the brackish marsh and the converted aquaculture ponds within the shanyutan wetland southeast china this study examined the effect of lulcc on sediment properties and related n2o production and emission 4 1 effects of land use change on sediment n cycling microbes other scholars have shown that the abundance of major n cycling functional genes in sediments are positively affected by n substrate availability bahram et al 2022 gao et al 2019 sun et al 2021 likewise in this study variations in the abundance of major n cycling functional genes in the sediment samples were correlated positively to n substrates fig 6 and negatively to c n ratio fig 6 confirming n substrate availability as a key factor regulating the sediment microbial community and its n cycling ability in coastal wetlands contrary to expectations that aquaculture would increase nitrogen loading to the sediment das et al 2004 burford and lorenzen 2004 we found that marsh actually had higher sediment tn and porewater inorganic nitrogen concentrations than pond table 1 likely a result of n release from marsh vegetation and high n input from the catchment li et al 2021b accordingly the abundance of the nitrifying functional genes aoa and comammox nitrospira amoa and denitrifying functional genes e g nirk nirs nosz ⅰ and nosz ⅱ in the marsh sediment were significantly more abundant than in the pond sediment fig 2 suggesting that land conversion of natural marsh to aquaculture ponds negatively impacted sediment n substrate i e tn nh4 n and no3 n availability and the corresponding sediment n cycling ability moreover comammox nitrospira amoa were positively correlated with no3 n and negatively impacted by land use change suggesting that the newly discovered nitrifying microorganisms might play an important role in sediment nitrification but were diminished during the conversion of natural marsh to aquaculture ponds 4 2 effects of land use change on sediment n2o production sediment n2o production potential decreased by 22 between coastal marsh and aquaculture ponds fig 4a suggesting that land conversion may have weakened the sediment s ability to produce n2o the sediment n cycle involves a series of aerobic e g nitrification and anaerobic e g denitrification microbial reactions with n2o as one of the intermediate products daims et al 2016 li et al 2021a in this study the variations in sediment n2o production potential were positively correlated to n substrates as well as the different n cycling functional genes fig 6 including the ones involved in ammonium oxidation aoa and comammox nitrospira amoa nitrite reduction nirk and nirs and nitrous oxide reduction nosz i and nosz ii both ammonium oxidation and nitrite reduction are steps in converting fixed n to n2o whereas nitrous oxide reduction converts no to n2o and further to n2 therefore the net production of n2o in the sediment depends on the balance between microbial formation and consumption of n2o our data suggest that the microbial processes of n2o formation outpaced n2o consumption leading to a net positive n2o production potential in the sediment in marsh sediment the strong correlations between n2o production potential and abundance of the aoa amoa gene fig s3a and the nirk gene fig s3c showed that ammonium oxidizing archaea and denitrifying bacteria were the key members of the microbial community to drive n2o production in coastal wetland conversely land conversion to aquaculture ponds appeared to have negatively impacted the populations of ammonium oxidizing archaea and denitrifying bacteria fig 2a c which combined with the lower n substrate availability likely explained the smaller sediment n2o production potential in the aquaculture ponds fig 4a 4 3 effects of land use change on n2o emission flux n2o emission in the brackish marsh correlated strongly and negatively with sediment salinity table s2 sediment salinity in the brackish marsh might vary due to tidal flushing and river runoff causing stress to the microbial community francis et al 2003 n2o emission flux was largest in the spring in coastal marsh fig 5b perhaps reflecting the effect of n substrates from decomposing biomass from the preceding winter jiang et al 2009 sommerfeld et al 1993 the aquaculture ponds were isolated from tides and river runoff and therefore sediment salinity variation was a less important factor n2o emission was highest in the summer fig 5c which was the beginning of the culture period and adding feeds and farmed animals would have increased n substrate availability for n2o production positive correlation table s2 the stagnant nature of pond water would have also allowed sediment temperature to increase in hot months summer causing increased microbial n2o production positive correlation table s2 and decreased n2o solubility consistent with the higher n2o emission flux in the summer fig 5c our data showed that overall the marsh sediment had higher n substrate concentrations abundances of major n cycling functional genes and sediment n2o production potential all expected to drive higher n2o emission in the marsh than in the aquaculture ponds according to the correlation analysis results fig 6 indeed except for the months of july and august in 2019 n2o emission fluxes in coastal marsh were consistently higher than in aquaculture ponds throughout the three year period sometimes by as much as 8 fold fig 5a averaging the entire data set n2o emission from the marsh was 4 times that from the aquaculture ponds fig 4b in addition we calculated the indirect n2o emission factor ef5 for the two habitat types following the n2o n no3 n mass ratio methodology hama aziz et al 2017 turner et al 2015 we found that the mean ef5 value in the brackish marsh 0 0008 was greater than that in the aquaculture ponds 0 0003 by over 2 6 times further demonstrating that the marsh was a stronger n2o source even at the same level of n supply overall the ef5 values in our two habitats were found to be lower than the ipcc default value of 0 0025 for rivers and estuaries de klein et al 2006 but comparable to those in other inland waters e g audet et al 2017 cooper et al 2017 outram and hiscock 2012 qin et al 2019 tian et al 2018 and estuaries maavara et al 2019 qi et al 2022 and even higher than those in rivers maavara et al 2019 hence the n2o emissions from brackish marshes and aquaculture ponds should not be overlooked in accounting for the global sources of n2o 4 4 long term land use change effects in the local context coastal and freshwater wetlands not only perform important ecosystem services but they are also major carbon sinks chmura et al 2003 mitsch et al 2013 as such reclamation of wetlands especially for farming purposes is expected to increase nutrient and organic loading to the systems compromise their carbon sequestration capacity and increase the overall production and emission of greenhouse gases including ch4 and n2o this appears to be true on a global scale tan et al 2019 however at the local scale the effect of lulcc may depend on changes to the local hydrology nutrient dynamics and microbial communities which need to be assessed by detailed comparisons between the original and the converted habitats our high frequency measurements over a three year period showed that the aquaculture ponds in the shanyutan wetland had lower n2o emission than the native brackish marsh which was supported by independent measurements of the lower n substrate concentrations lower major n cycling functional gene abundances and lower sediment n2o production potential in the pond sediment in the aquaculture ponds exogenous n supply in the form of feeds was one of the major sources of n substrates for n2o production in our study the rate of n input via feed application was approximately 28 5 g n m 2 year 1 meanwhile the average n2o emission from the aquaculture ponds was only 0 14 g n m 2 year 1 accounting for about 0 5 of the total annual n loading arising from feed inputs over 40 of the added n was actually incorporated into the biomass of the cultured whiteleg shrimps litopenaeus vannamei which had a relatively high nutrient utilization efficiency yang et al 2021 we found that our pond sediments had a mean denitrification potential and net n2o production potential of 54 6 and 42 1 ng g 1 d 1 respectively which implied that 23 of the n2o produced was further converted to n2 gas hence our results suggested that shrimp biomass incorporation and sediment n storage were likely major fates of the n applied in the ponds while gaseous loss of n was minimal in the brackish marshes the sediments can receive n supply from both surface water and atmospheric deposition for supporting n2o production in our study we observed a significantly higher amount of total nitrogen tn in the marsh sediments than that in the aquaculture pond sediments 1 34 vs 0 70 g kg 1 implying a substantially greater amount of external n inputs into the marsh as compared to the ponds owing to the greater n availability the brackish marshes had a significantly greater potential denitrification rate than the brackish marshes 92 9 vs 54 6 ng g 1 d 1 meanwhile the potential n2 production rate of denitrification was also much higher in the marshes than in the ponds 39 0 vs 12 5 ng g 1 d 1 with about 42 of the n2o produced in the marsh sediments being subsequently reduced as a result the brackish marsh sediments still had higher mean n2o production potential 53 9 vs 42 8 ng g 1 d 1 and net n2o emission rate 173 7 vs 42 9 µg m 2 h 1 when compared to the pond sediments taken together we suggest that conversion of the shanyutan brackish marsh to aquaculture ponds cut off n loading from the catchment and marsh vegetation that fueled n2o production of the residual n that entered the sediment its conversion to n2o would still require a series of microbial processes as our data showed the major n cycling functional gene abundances in the pond sediment were all significantly lower except the aob amoa fig 2 suggesting that the marsh sediment microbial community was negatively impacted by land reclamation leading to a much lower ability to produce n2o fig 4a and correspondingly a lower n2o emission fig 4b these findings are also consistent with an earlier study which using a mass balance approach showed that n2o emission accounted for 0 03 of the total n output from the aquaculture ponds yang et al 2021 microbial production of n2o can follow both aerobic and anaerobic pathways baggs 2011 yang et al 2015 in this study we incubated sediment slurry under anoxic condition and therefore we may have underestimated the sediment n2o production potential by excluding the aerobic processes although this would not have affected the functional gene abundance and emission flux measurements quantification of n2o production in situ using novel tracer method yeung et al 2019 would eliminate the need for incubation and generate more accurate data another interesting observation is the large between month and between year variations in n2o emission in the marsh fig 5 measurements at a lower frequency or measurements that cover a shorter period may lead to considerable errors in the n2o emission budget after harvesting shrimp farmers usually drain the ponds and dry the sediment this process while may release residual n into the estuary and increase n2o production and emission downstream would not be inducive to microbial n2o production in the pond sediment during the non farming period nevertheless post harvesting removal of sediment is not a common practice therefore continuous build up of n in the pond sediment may pose the risk of a future surge in n2o emission preventive measures to better manage n discharge and sediment build up would be needed to further mitigate n2o emission caused by the aquaculture operation 5 conclusion overall our findings highlighted the importance of local context for understanding lulcc effects on greenhouse gas dynamics while it may be tempting to presume that reclamation of natural wetlands to aquaculture ponds would increase n2o emission our multi year field study showed the opposite nevertheless our sampling was limited to the shanyutan wetland and one type of aquaculture operation whereas other wetlands and aquaculture systems may have different environmental conditions and microbial communities possibly resulting in different n2o dynamics reclamation of coastal wetlands for aquaculture is widespread throughout the southeastern coast of china from the tropical zone to the subtropical zone duan et al 2020 expanding the sampling efforts to the other regions would be needed for a fuller understanding of the lulcc effects on coastal greenhouse

15301,land reclamation is a major threat to the world s coastal wetlands and it may influence the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen in coastal regions conversion of coastal marshes into aquaculture ponds is common in the asian pacific region but its impacts on the production and emission of nitrogen greenhouse gases remain poorly understood in this study we compared n2o emission from a brackish marsh and converted shrimp aquaculture ponds in the shanyutan wetland the min river estuary in southeast china over a three year period we also measured sediment and porewater properties relevant functional gene abundance sediment n2o production potential and denitrification potential in the two habitats results indicated that the pond sediment had lower n substrate availability lower ammonia oxidation aoa and comammox nitrospira amoa nitrite reduction nirk and nirs and nitrous oxide reduction nosz ⅰ and nosz ⅱ gene abundance and lower n2o production and denitrification potentials than in marsh sediments consequently n2o emission fluxes from the aquaculture ponds range 5 4 251 8 μg m 2 h 1 were significantly lower than those from the marsh 12 6 570 7 μg m 2 h 1 overall our results show that conversion from marsh to shrimp aquaculture ponds in the shanyutan wetland may have diminished nutrient input from the catchment impacted the n cycling microbial community and lowered n2o production capacity of the sediment leading to lower n2o emissions better post harvesting management of pond water and sediment may further mitigate n2o emissions caused by the aquaculture operation

microorganisms and subsequent n2o biogeochemical processes huang et al 2010 jiang et al 2009 roulet 2000 but long term data on the direction and magnitude of these effects are lacking to investigate the climate effect of lulcc ideally one should monitor n2o production and emissions from the location before and after the creation of aquaculture ponds however this is impossible for existing ponds as an alternative one may compare n2o production and emission from the aquaculture ponds and the surrounding native habitat to that end we compared n2o emission fluxes between a brackish marsh and converted aquaculture ponds in the shanyutan wetland southeast china over a three year period to explore the underlying factors that may explain the differences we measured sediment and porewater properties major n cycling functional genes sediment n2o production and denitrification potentials between the two habitat types across the shrimp farming season the main research objectives are to 1 investigate differences in the sediment n2o production and denitrification potentials and the relevant bacterial gene abundance between marsh land and aquaculture ponds 2 assess the effects of marsh land conversion on n2o emissions 3 identify the main environmental factors influencing the change in n2o emissions we hypothesized that the conversion of coastal marsh to aquaculture ponds would decrease the n2o emissions by changing the hydrological and edaphic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the shanyutan wetland 26 00 36 to 26 03 42 n 119 34 12 to 119 40 40 e is located

rising demand for seafood primarily shrimp litopenaeus vannamei yang et al 2020 the size of the aquaculture ponds varied in the range of 1 2 3 0 ha and mean water depth was 1 5 m prior to farming the

production and emissions from the shanyutan wetland a brackish c malaccensis marsh stand and three nearby converted aquaculture ponds were chosen for comparison sediment sampling and incubation were conducted monthly between april 2019 and january 2020 for a total of 10 times n2o emission fluxes were measured between april 2019 and december 2021 in irregular time intervals subject to covid 19

grouping the data a seasonal pattern emerged with lower emission fluxes in autumn and winter and higher fluxes in spring and summer in both habitat types fig 5b and c 3 5 environmental drivers of n2o productions and fluxes the correlations between sediment n2o production potential and n2o emission flux and the different biotic and abiotic variables are shown in fig 6 based on pearson correlations fig 6 and rfp analysis fig 7 the changes in n2o emission flux were strongly driven by nirk gene abundance n substrate concentrations e g tn no3 n and nh4 n and ts which together explained nearly 55 of the variations based on rda sediment salinity c n ratio tn and porewater nh4 n concentration were the main variables explaining the changes of sediment n2o production potential and n2o emission fluxes in marsh in particular c n accounted for the largest contribution fig s2a in the aquaculture ponds sediment n2o production potential and n2o emission fluxes were strongly driven by ts and c n ratio which together explained nearly 83 of the changes fig s2b 4 discussion large increases in n2o and ch4 emissions following conversion of natural wetlands to agriculture systems e g croplands pastures which have also been reported by other scholars e g gleason et al 2009 huang et al 2010 tan et al 2019 olsson et al 2015 are usually attributed to the increase in precursor substrates and changes in soil properties tan et al 2019 for aquaculture ponds application of fertilizer organic loading from feeds and farmed animals and oxygen depletion in waterlogged sediment are all expected to promote n2o production and emission hu et al 2012 mosier et al 1991 tan et al 2020 in china and elsewhere in the asia pacific region conversion of natural wetlands to aquaculture ponds is widespread to satisfy the growing food demand raising concerns about their climate impact yuan et al 2019 strokal et al 2021 by comparing the brackish marsh and the converted aquaculture ponds within the shanyutan wetland southeast china this study examined the effect of lulcc on sediment properties and related n2o production and emission 4 1 effects of land use change on sediment n cycling microbes other scholars have shown that the abundance of major n cycling functional genes in sediments are positively affected by n substrate availability bahram et al 2022 gao et al 2019 sun et al 2021 likewise in this study variations in the abundance of major n cycling functional genes in the sediment samples were correlated positively to n substrates fig 6 and negatively to c n ratio fig 6 confirming n substrate availability as a key factor regulating the sediment microbial community and its n cycling ability in coastal wetlands contrary to expectations that aquaculture would increase nitrogen loading to the sediment das et al 2004 burford and lorenzen 2004 we found that marsh actually had higher sediment tn and porewater inorganic nitrogen concentrations than pond table 1 likely a result of n release from marsh vegetation and high n input from the catchment li et al 2021b accordingly the abundance of the nitrifying functional genes aoa and comammox nitrospira amoa and denitrifying functional genes e g nirk nirs nosz ⅰ and nosz ⅱ in the marsh sediment were significantly more abundant than in the pond sediment fig 2 suggesting that land conversion of natural marsh to aquaculture ponds negatively impacted sediment n substrate i e tn nh4 n and no3 n availability and the corresponding sediment n cycling ability moreover comammox nitrospira amoa were positively correlated with no3 n and negatively impacted by land use change suggesting that the newly discovered nitrifying microorganisms might play an important role in sediment nitrification but were diminished during the conversion of natural marsh to aquaculture ponds 4 2 effects of land use change on sediment n2o production sediment n2o production potential decreased by 22 between coastal marsh and aquaculture ponds fig 4a suggesting that land conversion may have weakened the sediment s ability to produce n2o the sediment n cycle involves a series of aerobic e g nitrification and anaerobic e g denitrification microbial reactions with n2o as one of the intermediate products daims et al 2016 li et al 2021a in this study the variations in sediment n2o production potential were positively correlated to n substrates as well as the different n cycling functional genes fig 6 including the ones involved in ammonium oxidation aoa and comammox nitrospira amoa nitrite reduction nirk and nirs and nitrous oxide reduction nosz i and nosz ii both ammonium oxidation and nitrite reduction are steps in converting fixed n to n2o whereas nitrous oxide reduction converts no to n2o and further to n2 therefore the net production of n2o in the sediment depends on the balance between microbial formation and consumption of n2o our data suggest that the microbial processes of n2o formation outpaced n2o consumption leading to a net positive n2o production potential in the sediment in marsh sediment the strong correlations between n2o production potential and abundance of the aoa amoa gene fig s3a and the nirk gene fig s3c showed that ammonium oxidizing archaea and denitrifying bacteria were the key members of the microbial community to drive n2o production in coastal wetland conversely land conversion to aquaculture ponds appeared to have negatively impacted the populations of ammonium oxidizing archaea and denitrifying bacteria fig 2a c which combined with the lower n substrate availability likely explained the smaller sediment n2o production potential in the aquaculture ponds fig 4a 4 3 effects of land use change on n2o emission flux n2o emission in the brackish marsh correlated strongly and negatively with sediment salinity table s2 sediment salinity in the brackish marsh might vary due to tidal flushing and river runoff causing stress to the microbial community francis et al 2003 n2o emission flux was largest in the spring in coastal marsh fig 5b perhaps reflecting the effect of n substrates from decomposing biomass from the preceding winter jiang et al 2009 sommerfeld et al 1993 the aquaculture ponds were isolated from tides and river runoff and therefore sediment salinity variation was a less important factor n2o emission was highest in the summer fig 5c which was the beginning of the culture period and adding feeds and farmed animals would have increased n substrate availability for n2o production positive correlation table s2 the stagnant nature of pond water would have also allowed sediment temperature to increase in hot months summer causing increased microbial n2o production positive correlation table s2 and decreased n2o solubility consistent with the higher n2o emission flux in the summer fig 5c our data showed that overall the marsh sediment had higher n substrate concentrations abundances of major n cycling functional genes and sediment n2o production potential all expected to drive higher n2o emission in the marsh than in the aquaculture ponds according to the correlation analysis results fig 6 indeed except for the months of july and august in 2019 n2o emission fluxes in coastal marsh were consistently higher than in aquaculture ponds throughout the three year period sometimes by as much as 8 fold fig 5a averaging the entire data set n2o emission from the marsh was 4 times that from the aquaculture ponds fig 4b in addition we calculated the indirect n2o emission factor ef5 for the two habitat types following the n2o n no3 n mass ratio methodology hama aziz et al 2017 turner et al 2015 we found that the mean ef5 value in the brackish marsh 0 0008 was greater than that in the aquaculture ponds 0 0003 by over 2 6 times further demonstrating that the marsh was a stronger n2o source even at the same level of n supply overall the ef5 values in our two habitats were found to be lower than the ipcc default value of 0 0025 for rivers and estuaries de klein et al 2006 but comparable to those in other inland waters e g audet et al 2017 cooper et al 2017 outram and hiscock 2012 qin et al 2019 tian et al 2018 and estuaries maavara et al 2019 qi et al 2022 and even higher than those in rivers maavara et al 2019 hence the n2o emissions from brackish marshes and aquaculture ponds should not be overlooked in accounting for the global sources of n2o 4 4 long term land use change effects in the local context coastal and freshwater wetlands not only perform important ecosystem services but they are also major carbon sinks chmura et al 2003 mitsch et al 2013 as such reclamation of wetlands especially for farming purposes is expected to increase nutrient and organic loading to the systems compromise their carbon sequestration capacity and increase the overall production and emission of greenhouse gases including ch4 and n2o this appears to be true on a global scale tan et al 2019 however at the local scale the effect of lulcc may depend on changes to the local hydrology nutrient dynamics and microbial communities which need to be assessed by detailed comparisons between the original and the converted habitats our high frequency measurements over a three year period showed that the aquaculture ponds in the shanyutan wetland had lower n2o emission than the native brackish marsh which was supported by independent measurements of the lower n substrate concentrations lower major n cycling functional gene abundances and lower sediment n2o production potential in the pond sediment in the aquaculture ponds exogenous n supply in the form of feeds was one of the major sources of n substrates for n2o production in our study the rate of n input via feed application was approximately 28 5 g n m 2 year 1 meanwhile the average n2o emission from the aquaculture ponds was only 0 14 g n m 2 year 1 accounting for about 0 5 of the total annual n loading arising from feed inputs over 40 of the added n was actually incorporated into the biomass of the cultured whiteleg shrimps litopenaeus vannamei which had a relatively high nutrient utilization efficiency yang et al 2021 we found that our pond sediments had a mean denitrification potential and net n2o production potential of 54 6 and 42 1 ng g 1 d 1 respectively which implied that 23 of the n2o produced was further converted to n2 gas hence our results suggested that shrimp biomass incorporation and sediment n storage were likely major fates of the n applied in the ponds while gaseous loss of n was minimal in the brackish marshes the sediments can receive n supply from both surface water and atmospheric deposition for supporting n2o production in our study we observed a significantly higher amount of total nitrogen tn in the marsh sediments than that in the aquaculture pond sediments 1 34 vs 0 70 g kg 1 implying a substantially greater amount of external n inputs into the marsh as compared to the ponds owing to the greater n availability the brackish marshes had a significantly greater potential denitrification rate than the brackish marshes 92 9 vs 54 6 ng g 1 d 1 meanwhile the potential n2 production rate of denitrification was also much higher in the marshes than in the ponds 39 0 vs 12 5 ng g 1 d 1 with about 42 of the n2o produced in the marsh sediments being subsequently reduced as a result the brackish marsh sediments still had higher mean n2o production potential 53 9 vs 42 8 ng g 1 d 1 and net n2o emission rate 173 7 vs 42 9 µg m 2 h 1 when compared to the pond sediments taken together we suggest that conversion of the shanyutan brackish marsh to aquaculture ponds cut off n loading from the catchment and marsh vegetation that fueled n2o production of the residual n that entered the sediment its conversion to n2o would still require a series of microbial processes as our data showed the major n cycling functional gene abundances in the pond sediment were all significantly lower except the aob amoa fig 2 suggesting that the marsh sediment microbial community was negatively impacted by land reclamation leading to a much lower ability to produce n2o fig 4a and correspondingly a lower n2o emission fig 4b these findings are also consistent with an earlier study which using a mass balance approach showed that n2o emission accounted for 0 03 of the total n output from the aquaculture ponds yang et al 2021 microbial production of n2o can follow both aerobic and anaerobic pathways baggs 2011 yang et al 2015 in this study we incubated sediment slurry under anoxic condition and therefore we may have underestimated the sediment n2o production potential by excluding the aerobic processes although this would not have affected the functional gene abundance and emission flux measurements quantification of n2o production in situ using novel tracer method yeung et al 2019 would eliminate the need for incubation and generate more accurate data another interesting observation is the large between month and between year variations in n2o emission in the marsh fig 5 measurements at a lower frequency or measurements that cover a shorter period may lead to considerable errors in the n2o emission budget after harvesting shrimp farmers usually drain the ponds and dry the sediment this process while may release residual n into the estuary and increase n2o production and emission downstream would not be inducive to microbial n2o production in the pond sediment during the non farming period nevertheless post harvesting removal of sediment is not a common practice therefore continuous build up of n in the pond sediment may pose the risk of a future surge in n2o emission preventive measures to better manage n discharge and sediment build up would be needed to further mitigate n2o emission caused by the aquaculture operation 5 conclusion overall our findings highlighted the importance of local context for understanding lulcc effects on greenhouse gas dynamics while it may be tempting to presume that reclamation of natural wetlands to aquaculture ponds would increase n2o emission our multi year field study showed the opposite nevertheless our sampling was limited to the shanyutan wetland and one type of aquaculture operation whereas other wetlands and aquaculture systems may have different environmental conditions and microbial communities possibly resulting in different n2o dynamics reclamation of coastal wetlands for aquaculture is widespread throughout the southeastern coast of china from the tropical zone to the subtropical zone duan et al 2020 expanding the sampling efforts to the other regions would be needed for a fuller understanding of the lulcc effects on coastal greenhouse

aqueous environments dublet et al 2019 in sediment and soil studies particles with sizes of 1 μm are commonly considered as colloids li et al 2019b these colloids play an important role in riverine u

strength or flocculants u carrying colloids will aggregate settle and adhere to the sediment thereby inhibiting u migration ho et al 2022 li et al 2019a yin et al 2021 the colloidal properties such as

been made in recent years the release behavior of sediment colloidal u with different sized carriers remains unclear in actual rivers according to the special climatic geographic and pollution conditions of the ili basin the release behavior of different u species from river sediment as well as the local influence factors were elucidated in this work the main objectives of this work are 1 to investigate the particle size distribution of u containing particles in the river sediment and overlying water in the ili basin 2 to determine the chemical composition and morphological characteristics of colloids by nano infrared spectroscopy nanoir and electron microscopy 3 to assess the effects of environmental factors on the release of sediment colloidal u and 4 to elucidate the release and settlement rules of colloidal u under dynamic and stationary hydrodynamic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection six sampling sites were selected from three rivers in the ili basin the rivers are marked as r1 r2 and r3 in fig 1 and the geographic coordinates of the sampling sites are given in table s1 the river water and sediment samples were collected during the high water period in april 2021 the samples were transported to the lab within 4 hours and the water quality parameters as well as the sediment properties were analyzed immediately see table s2 2 2

adapted from a technology for separating soil particles xu and guo 2017 and the detailed procedure was described in the supporting materials see text s1 briefly sieves were used to sieve gravel and fine sand settling columns were used to obtain silt centrifugation was adopted to obtain fine silt and submicron colloid and ultrafiltration centrifuge tubes ufc5003bk millipore usa with a 3 kda cutoff were used to separate nano colloid and dissolved species notably only species 3 kda were defined as the dissolved phase in this work while the cutoff size was 0 22 or 0 45 µm in the conventional treatments the ultrafiltration membranes were calibrated using standard macromolecules namely 1 3 kda vb12 and 67 kda bovine serum albumin see text s2 and fig s1 the particle sizes of the submicron colloid and nano colloid fractions were examined using a zetasizer nanozs 90 malvern instrument uk to check the validity of the separation method see fig s2 he et al 2023 2 3 colloid release after sediment disturbance sediments were the main u pollution source and the sediment u release was controlled by both hydrodynamic and hydrochemical factors dong et al 2021 a series of batch experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of disturbance intensity from 0 to 250 rpm oxygen 0 and 21 temperature from 5 to 35 c ph from 4 0 to 9 0 and four environment related salts nacl nahco3 cacl2 and na2so4 from 0 to 200 mm on sediment u release the serum bottle 60 ml was used in triplicate and each contained 7 ml of sediment and 35 ml of overlying water both sediment and overlying water were collected from the site r2 2 argon gas ar and deoxygenated water were supplied in the anaerobic group oxygen of 0 and air oxygen of approximately 21 was retained in all other groups the serum bottles were taken on a shaker under a condition of 150 rpm 20 c and ph 7 0 unless the parameter was studied after 6 h of shaking and another 6 h of settling the overlying water was sampled for the analysis of colloid and u content the residual sediment was collected for a tessier five step sequential extraction and the u speciation including exchangeable exc carbonate bound carb iron manganese oxides bound femnox organic matter bound om and residual res phases were determined see text s4 he et al 2019 2 4 simulated experiments of flowing and stationary rivers to simulate flowing rivers three rectangular channels were constructed each channel was 100 cm 3 cm 5 cm l w h with a bed slope of 1 see fig s3 overflow weirs were installed at the inlet and outlet in order to reduce the influence of the inlet and outlet on the flow regime in each channel 300 g of sediment was added uniformly and approximately 3 cm deep of overlying water was provided the flow rate was maintained at a given value by a peristaltic pump and the simulated rivers were in laminar reynolds 110 or 220 and turbulent conditions reynolds 1100 or 2200 see table s3 the reynolds number re was adopted to distinguish the flow regime and calculated as follows r e u r v where v is the kinematic viscosity m2 s u is the average velocity m s and r is the hydraulic radius m for open channel flow the flow regime is usually laminar when re 500 and turbulent when re 500 after ten hydraulic retention times hrt the overlying water was collected and analyzed for colloid and u content the fates of colloid and u in stationary waters were simulated in still beakers the sediment was shaken at 250 rpm for 6 h transferred to three 1 0 l beakers covered with gauze and settled in an incubator 20 c for 180 days the overlying water was periodically sampled and analyzed 2 5 colloid characterization the microstructural and composition of colloid particles were characterized using various advanced techniques including high angular angle dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy haadf stem and atomic force microscopy based nanoscale infrared spectroscopy afm nanoir the samples were

micron in both x and y axes 2 6 physical and chemical analyses the masses of different sediment particle fractions and water colloids were measured after classification after drying fine silt as well as larger particles were weighed directly by an electronic analytical balance the masses of colloidal particles were measured by spectrophotometry uv 1800 shimadzu japan at λ 680 nm there was a good linear relationship r2 0 998 between colloid concentration and their optical density od see fig s4 the total organic carbon toc of colloids was measured using a toc analyzer toc v cpn shimadzu japan the u contents in different fractions were determined the dissolved u was directly analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms plasma quant ms elite analytik jena ag germany particles were digested with hno3 hf hclo 4 4 1 mixture at 180 200 c and then the digestion solution was measured by icp ms considering the adsorption and retention of nano colloids on the ultrafiltration membrane the u content in nano colloids were calculated by subtracting the dissolved fraction from the suspension containing nano colloids and dissolved species the detailed procedure and quality assurance qa are shown in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 abundant nano colloidal u in river water and sediment three rivers located in the ili basin were investigated and the locations of the sampling sites are shown in fig 1 the total u concentration in the river water samples containing colloids ranged from 5 39 to 8 75 μg l with the highest u concentration at site r2 2 in all the tested water samples u was mainly distributed in the nano colloidal phase 50 2 68 4 84 μg l followed by the dissolved phase 2 09 3 45 μg l and the last in the submicron colloidal phase 0 32 0 56 μg l particle size analysis of the aqueous colloids showed that the river water contained 83 4 v v of submicron colloids and 16 6 of nano colloids fig s5a although the percentage of nano colloids was low their u content was up to 4 84 μg l while that in the submicron colloids was only 0 45 μg l the sediment samples at site r2 2 were analyzed for particle and metal distribution figs 2 and s6 as shown in fig 2 the smaller the particle size the higher the u content the colloidal particles 1 μm contained up to 27 6 4 2 μg g of u which was much higher than the average content of sediment u 4 1 0 2 μg g among the sediment colloids the nano colloidal u accounted for 70 23 see the inset of fig 2b the above finding showed that u preferentially accumulated in finer particles especially nano colloids this could be attributed to the fact that u in the river sediment was an exogenous contaminant and fine particles have high adsorption capacities for u due to their high specific surface areas yu et al 2021 the distributions of fe and al in sediment particles are shown in fig s6 and fe has a distribution similar to u 3 2 characterization of colloidal particles the microscopic morphology and chemical composition of the colloidal particles in river water were analyzed by haadf stem sem eds and afm nanoir techniques in figs 3 and s7 haadf stem and eds mapping images showed that submicron colloids and nano colloids had completely different morphologies and elemental compositions the submicron colloids contained many irregularly shaped crystal minerals fig 3a with elements o si c ca al and fe as the main constituents see fig 3c the nano colloids consisted of powdery substances fig 3d with only c and o as the major elements see figs 3f and s7f uranium was not detected in any of the samples due to its low contents the above findings suggested that submicron colloids might consist mainly of inorganic minerals such as clay minerals while nano colloids consisted mainly of particulate organic matter pom mccabe et al 2021 zheng et al 2020 the toc in the nano colloids accounted for 58 0 87 9 of the total carbon which also supported that the nano colloids contained abundant organic matter to assess the u uranyl ion adsorption characteristics of different colloids 4 mm of uranyl was added to the river water sample r2 2 after adsorption equilibrium the colloids were classified into submicron colloids and nano colloids the microscopic morphology and u distribution of different colloids were analyzed by haadf stem in fig s8 the results showed that the nano colloids adsorbed a large amount of u with a percentage of 50 2 w w fig s8d while that in the submicron colloids was only 13 5 w w fig s8b in the nano colloids u was uniformly distributed in the particles and was overlapped with the distributions of elements c and o fig s8c several previous studies also found a strong positive correlation between u and organic matter and they might have a strong affinity for each other bone et al 2017 parker et al 2022 in fig 4 the afm nanoir images showed the morphology and functional group distribution of the nano colloids in the afm image fig 4a there were two large clusters marked by white dashed lines they consisted of multiple small clusters of sizes ranging from tens of nanometers marked by green dashed lines original particles to one micron marked by yellow dashed lines primary clusters a similar agglomeration phenomenon has been found in previous studies on pom in which original particles first aggregated into primary clusters and then the primary clusters further aggregated into larger agglomerates mercadal et al 2021 in fig 4a five points were selected for single point ir analysis including four sample points marked by colored dots and one background point marked by a red triangle the results in fig 4b showed that the four sample points had similar infrared peaks at near 3400 cm 1 there was a very broad ir peak corresponding to the stretching vibration of oh the peaks at 2960 cm 1 and 2920 cm 1 were the stretching vibrations of aliphatic ch3 and ch2 respectively the peaks at 1450 1350 cm 1 were the bending vibrations of ch3 and ch2 the peak at 1730 cm 1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of the carbonyl group c o farber et al 2019 hernandez soriano et al 2018 the background point red curve had no significant ir peak in the tested range in the ir mapping images fig 4c the hydroxyl groups oh at 3400 cm 1 were widely distributed in the nano colloids and they might be derived from hydroxyl groups in organic matter or from bound water although the samples were freeze dried for 24 h before analysis some strongly bound water molecules would still be present in the nano colloids the groups c o ch3 and ch2 were relatively abundant indicating that the nano colloids consisted mainly of pom wang et al 2022b among them the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups are negatively charged and might be the adsorption sites for u uranyl cations bone et al 2017 the afm nanoir images of the submicron colloids are shown in fig s9 and organic functional groups were not detected in conclusion the nano colloids in the river water were mainly composed of pom which contained high levels of u some previous studies also found that high u contents often occurred in organic matter rich sediments and that u transport was associated with pom dublet et al 2019 parker et al 2022 the reasons for u accumulation on nano colloids were 1 the nano colloids had very high specific surface area due to small sizes and had high adsorption capacity for u see fig s8 2 the nano colloids were strongly negatively charged zeta potential of 41 7 2 2 mv and had strong electrostatic attraction to positively charged uranyl ions lan et al 2019 and 3 the surface of the nano colloids contained many functional groups including hydroxyl and carboxyl groups see fig 4 which provided many active sites for u adsorption and complexation parker et al 2022 3 3 colloidal u release from sediment in order to study the characteristics of sediment u release after physical disturbance the sediment and overlying water 1 4 v v were loaded into serum bottles and shaken at different rates after 6 h of shaking and 6 h of settling the colloid content and u distribution in the overlying water were measured by visual observation see fig s10 it was found that when the shaking rate was 100 rpm the mud water interface was present the supernatant was clear at 50 rpm and became blurred at 100 rpm when the shaking rate was greater than 100 rpm the mud water interface disappeared and sediment and water were fully mixed as shown in fig 5 a the release behavior of colloidal particles was consistent with the visual observation after the mud water was fully mixed 100 rpm the colloids started to release in large quantities this indicated that sediment disturbance was a prerequisite for the large release of colloids into the overlying water at the beginning the overlying water contained 15 0 0 5 μg l of nano colloidal u 6 6 1 1 μg l of dissolved u and 0 02 0 00 μg l of submicron colloidal u at a shaking rate of 50 rpm there was no increase of u in the overlying water indicating that the sediment did not release u when the shaking rate was 100 rpm the nano colloidal and dissolved u started to release and the submicron colloidal u was still not released at this shaking rate there was only a slight disturbance at the mud water interface at shaking rates of 100 rpm the submicron colloidal u started to release the nano colloidal u first increased and then stabilized and the dissolved u first increased and then decreased since the sediment total u decreased see fig 5b and the solution submicron colloidal u increased see fig 5a when the shaking rate increased from 150 to 250 rpm the decrease in dissolved u might be due to the adsorption of u onto the released submicron colloids these findings suggested that nano colloids were the predominant form of u release 55 70 and large amounts of nano colloidal u were released even if the sediment surface was only slightly disturbed however the role of submicron colloids cannot be ignored under strong perturbations after the above experiments the u content and speciation in the sediment were analyzed see fig 5b as the shaking rate increased from 0 to 250 rpm the total u content in the sediment decreased from 3 50 0 03 to 2 52 0 16 μg g the sediment u speciation showed a clear decrease in the exchangeable and organic matter bound u and an increase in the residual u this indicated that the u released from the sediment was mainly the exchangeable and organic matter bound u species the organic matter bound u might be released in the form of nano colloidal particles after sediment disturbance according to the above findings that the nano colloids were composed of pom 3 4 effects of environmental factors on u release the ili basin has special environmental conditions which may substantially influence the release of sediment u in the spring the snowmelt and glacier melt brings large amounts of cold and oxygen rich surface runoff the ili basin is saline alkaline soils and as runoff flows through the soil it carries salt and alkali into rivers therefore environmental conditions including oxygen temperature ph and salts were investigated in this study 3 4 1 oxygen the batch experiments were performed under aerobic approximately 21 of oxygen in headspace and anaerobic conditions in order to investigate the effect of oxygen on the release of sediment colloids and u in fig s11 the results showed that there was no significant difference between the two groups above indicating that oxygen did not change the u release behavior during the sediment perturbation 3 4 2 temperature to evaluate the effect of temperature on the release of sediment colloids and u batch experiments were performed at 150 rpm ph 7 0 and different temperatures 5 35 c in fig 6 a the releases of sediment colloids and submicron colloidal u increased slightly with an increasing temperature while that of nano colloidal u decreased substantially the nano colloidal u content decreased from 18 9 0 4 μg l 5 c to 8 4 0 9 μg l 35 c low temperatures were favorable for nano colloids to remain stable while high temperatures were prone to agglomeration angayarkanni and philip 2015 at high temperatures strong brownian motion and low water viscosity increased the chances of colloidal collisions wang et al 2017 thus promoting nano colloidal agglomeration 3 3 3 ph the release of sediment colloids and u as a function of ph 4 0 9 0 is depicted in fig 6b the release of sediment colloids and submicron colloidal u increased rapidly at ph 8 0 while the dissolved u decreased rapidly with the increasing ph under alkaline conditions ph 8 0 colloids carried more negative charges and colloidal particles repelled each other to be more stable thereby promoting the release of sediment colloids and submicron colloidal u wang et al 2020 the substantial decrease in dissolved u at high ph levels might be related to the formation of uranium containing hydroxides pan et al 2022 nano colloidal u was the highest 41 1 4 1 μg l under a neutral condition ph 7 0 and it decreased under both acidic and basic conditions lan et al 2019 velasco et al 2021 under acidic conditions the organic matter in nano colloids was commonly protonated which reduced the negative charge of nano colloids and made them more susceptible to agglomeration ge et al 2018 in addition this also caused the desorption of uranyl ions from the nano colloids under alkaline conditions some of the pom might dissolve thereby reducing the concentration of nano colloidal u velasco et al 2021 3 4 4 environment related salts a heat map analysis of water quality data from the three rivers is given in fig s12 the results showed that u was strongly correlated with ca2 hco3 and salinity indicating that ca2 hco3 and other environment related ions in the water had important effects on u release therefore batch experiments were conducted with different concentrations of four environment related salts nacl cacl2 nahco3 and na2so4 as shown in fig 6c the sediment colloids and submicron colloidal u release decreased largely with an increasing salt concentration among them cacl2 was the most effective in inhibiting colloids and submicron colloidal u release followed by nacl and na2so4 and the worst was nahco3 cations can compress the electrical double layer on the colloidal surface and improve agglomeration shao et al 2021 thereby inhibiting colloidal release comparing the results of cacl2 and nacl showed that divalent cations were more effective than monovalent cations at the same concentration of 10 mm the inhibition of colloidal release was 84 3 for cacl2 but only 4 2 for nacl this could be explained by the fact that ca2 ions promoted colloidal agglomeration through double layer compression charge neutralization and divalent cation bridging castan et al 2019 according to the results of nacl na2so4 and nahco3 it showed that anion cl was the most effective followed by so4 2 and hco3 was the least in fig 6c nahco3 substantially increased the release of nano colloidal and dissolved u after the addition of 50 mm nahco3 the release of nano colloidal and dissolved u increased by 6 6 and 7 3 times respectively however nahco3 did not increase the release of other elements in the sediment such as fe see fig s13d it is well known that co3 2 can complex with uranyl ions to form dissolved uranyl carbonate complexes riedel and kubeck 2018 which must lead to the desorption and release of sediment u since the nano colloids could adsorb carbonate see fig s14 a portion of the uranyl carbonate complexes might be adsorbed by the nano colloids yin et al 2021 which increased the nano colloidal u in addition hco3 could reduce the content of divalent ions such as ca2 which also promoted colloidal release in conclusion cations especially divalent cations can inhibit the release of colloidal u while hco3 can greatly promote the release of nano colloidal and dissolved u 3 5 simulated experiments of flowing and stationary rivers 3 5 1 colloidal u release in flowing rivers the effect of hydraulic conditions on the release of colloidal particles and u was investigated using the simulated river channels fig s3 as shown in fig 7 a the effect of flow velocity on sediment colloid release was small under laminar flow conditions re 110 220 however under turbulent flow conditions re 1100 2200 flow velocity had a strong effect on colloidal release at re 1100 the released colloid concentration was 0 04 0 01 g l while it increased to 0 09 0 01 g l at re 2200 under a turbulent flow regime the river water had a strong perturbation effect on the sediment due to the unsteady flow which enhanced the release of colloidal particles moreover aggregated colloids could be broken down into small colloids by fluid shear forces ling et al 2022 which would also increase colloids in water the release of dissolved u was influenced by the flow velocity under both laminar and turbulent flow regimes under a laminar flow regime the liquid film between the sediment and water became thinner with an increasing flow rate which facilitated the diffusion of dissolved species between sediment and water van dael et al 2021 overall nano colloidal u was the most abundant in the stimulated rivers which was consistent with the findings from the real rivers see fig 1 this again confirmed the important role of nano colloids in u release and transport in the rivers of the ili basin 3 5 2 aqueous u behavior in stationary waters the changes of the overlying water colloids and u were investigated in the simulated stationary waters as shown in fig 7b the initial content of colloidal particles in the overlying water was 0 55 0 01 g l which decreased to 0 06 0 01 g l after 10 days and stabilized at a low level of 0 01 0 00 g l after 150 days the trend of submicron colloidal u was consistent with that of colloidal particles nano colloidal u slightly increased from an initial 27 2 μg l to 32 1 μg l after 2 days and then decreased rapidly to a final level of 3 2 μg l dissolved u substantially decreased in the first 10 days but increased after 10 days dissolved u might adsorb on colloidal particles and be removed from water after particle settlement which could explain the decrease in the first 10 days the increase in dissolved u after 10 days might be due to the oxidation of u iv by air o2 which converted insoluble u iv into dissolved u vi and released dissolved u into the aqueous phase bone et al 2017 therefore during the dry periods when rivers do not flow or flow slowly dissolved u may become the main release pathway of sediment u in the ili basin 3 6 environmental significance of river nano colloidal u the ili basin has the most abundant river runoff in xinjiang with an average annual runoff of 1 53 1010 m3 based on the results in fig 1 the u migration through river runoff in the ili basin was estimated to be 82 134 t a of which the nano colloidal u was up to 41 74 t a snowmelt and glacier melt are the main sources of river runoff in this region which increases river flow and commonly causes snowmelt floods in spring jiang et al 2022 liu et al 2022 the low temperature and turbulent flow of river water will greatly increase the release and migration of nano colloidal u since these conditions improve nano colloidal generation and stability however spring is an important season for the growth of forage grasses and aquatic plants and the hazard of nano colloidal u to local flora fauna and humans may be seriously underestimated in the context of global warming glacial meltwater is increasing in the ili basin and the increased river flow will enhance sediment disturbance which promotes the generation of colloids and colloidal u furthermore the increased temperature will promote microbial metabolism and produce more inorganic carbon the inorganic carbon content will increase in river water and sediment pore water which may greatly promote the release and migration of nano colloidal u 4 conclusions the colloidal u release from the river sediment in the ili basin was studied and its influence factors were investigated uranium in the river water was mainly distributed in the nano colloidal phase 2 68 4 84 μg l which was obviously higher than the dissolved phase 2 09 3 45 μg l and submicron colloidal phase 0 32 0 56 μg l the nano colloids consisted mainly of pom which had a high adsorption capacity for u 70 23 of colloidal u large amounts of nano colloidal u were released after sediment disturbance and low temperature low salinity neutral ph high inorganic carbon and high flow rate facilitated nano colloidal u release according to the findings that increasing ca2 and ph could reduce the release of nano colloidal and dissolved u we proposed applying lime or quicklime around the open piles of u rich coal to interrupt the source

15302,due to the limitations of the conventional water sample pretreatment methods some of the colloidal uranium u has long been misidentified as dissolved phase in this work the u species in river water in the ili basin was classified into submicron colloidal 0 1 1 μm nano colloidal 0 1 μm 3 kda and dissolved phases 3 kda by using high speed centrifugation and ultrafiltration the u concentration in the river water was 5 39 8 75 μg l which was dominated by nano colloidal phase 55 70 the nano colloidal particles were mainly composed of particulate organic matter pom and had a very high adsorption capacity for u accounting for 70 23 of colloidal u sediment disturbance low temperature and high inorganic carbon greatly improved the release of nano colloidal u but high levels of ca2 inhibited it the simulated river experiments indicated that the flow regime determined the release of nano colloidal u and large amounts of nano colloidal u might be released during spring floods in the ili basin moreover global warming increases river flow and inorganic carbon content which may greatly promote the release and migration of nano colloidal u graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sediment disturbance uranium migration nano colloid particulate organic matter pom flow regime 1 introduction uranium u is a non essential element for life and is known to be radioactive and chemically toxic gonzalez cuesta et al 2022 due to the mining processing and utilization of u or u rich mines u contamination has occurred in many areas worldwide coyte and vengosh 2020 el hayek et al 2021 he et al 2022 for example mining activities at the jackpile mine have led to u contamination of water bodies and sediments near the pueblo of laguna new mexico velasco et al 2019 due to pollution from mine drainage the u concentration in forested wetlands located in ty gallen britanny france was up to 4 500 mg kg stetten et al 2018 the ili basin is a well known coal producing region in xinjiang china with 300 billion tons of coal reserves li et al 2014 however the coal seams are rich in u with a maximum content of 7 207 mg kg dai et al 2015 within the past decades the coal resources in this region have been exploited in a haphazard manner leading to u contamination near the mining areas dong et al 2021 wufuer et al 2018 when u enters the aqueous environment it tends to be enriched in the sediment due to adsorption and precipitation bone et al 2020 when the hydrodynamic and hydrochemical environments are changed u in the sediment can be back into the water through mineral dissolution and or surface desorption miranda et al 2021 riedel and kubeck 2018 sediment disturbance is prevalent due to hydrodynamic or benthic activities lueder et al 2020 wang et al 2022a under disturbance sediment is dispersed into the water which accelerates the release of sediment u noel et al 2019 due to historical pollution considerable amounts of u have accumulated in river sediment in the ili basin which is an important source of u pollution at present dong et al 2021 in addition to dissolved uranyl ions uo2 2 colloid bound u is also present in aqueous environments dublet et al 2019 in sediment and soil studies particles with sizes of 1 μm are commonly considered as colloids li et al 2019b these colloids play an important role in riverine u migration but this role is often overlooked due to the limitations of the conventional filtration methods the conventional dissolved fraction is defined as the filtrate passing through a 0 22 or 0 45 μm filter membrane which includes some colloidal particles into the dissolved fraction walch et al 2022 the migration and release behaviors of colloidal particles is completely different from that of dissolved ions and the conventional manipulation is bound to produce large biases therefore more accurate experimental methods and analytical tools are needed in aqueous environments u can form intrinsic colloids through hydrolytic condensation reactions zänker and hennig 2014 and pseudocolloids through complexation or adsorption on other colloids e g mineral particles polymeric organic matters and microorganisms safonov et al 2022 won et al 2019 the aqueous colloids may influence on u migration in a mining influenced wetland in france u was bound to colloids composed of fe ii and organic matter which significantly increased u mobility wang et al 2014 in wetlands located in tims branch wyoming and grimsel u in the sediment was released into the aqueous phase through the colloids and transported over long distances bone et al 2020 montoya et al 2022 parker et al 2022 however in some cases colloids may reduce the mobility of u for example in the presence of high ionic strength or flocculants u carrying colloids will aggregate settle and adhere to the sediment thereby inhibiting u migration ho et al 2022 li et al 2019a yin et al 2021 the colloidal properties such as size and composition affect the mobility of colloids and the pollutants they carry dublet et al 2019 size plays an important role in the adsorption capacity and physical mobility of colloids hochella et al 2019 for example colloids with small sizes easily adsorb u dublet et al 2019 and have high mobility yang et al 2022 particles with sizes between 1 and 100 nm are called nano colloids and those between 0 1 and 1 μm are called submicron colloids li et al 2019b among them nano colloids have strong stability and are not easy to aggregate or settle the composition of the colloids also affects the binding of metals to the colloids ho et al 2022 the erosion of parent materials and the formation of secondary minerals can produce inorganic colloids including layered silicates quartz carbonates iron oxides hydroxides etc wei et al 2022 wen et al 2019 organic matters such as humic substances proteins and polysaccharides can form organic colloids in the environment worms et al 2019 in many contaminated sediments organic matters greatly affected the fate of u while clay minerals played a minor role bone et al 2020 dublet et al 2019 highly reactive functional groups of organic matters e g carboxyl and hydroxyl groups can increase the complexation and precipitation of u and thus influence the migration of u stetten et al 2018 velasco et al 2019 although much progress on colloidal u has been made in recent years the release behavior of sediment colloidal u with different sized carriers remains unclear in actual rivers according to the special climatic geographic and pollution conditions of the ili basin the release behavior of different u species from river sediment as well as the local influence factors were elucidated in this work the main objectives of this work are 1 to investigate the particle size distribution of u containing particles in the river sediment and overlying water in the ili basin 2 to determine the chemical composition and morphological characteristics of colloids by nano infrared spectroscopy nanoir and electron microscopy 3 to assess the effects of environmental factors on the release of sediment colloidal u and 4 to elucidate the release and settlement rules of colloidal u under dynamic and stationary hydrodynamic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection six sampling sites were selected from three rivers in the ili basin the rivers are marked as r1 r2 and r3 in fig 1 and the geographic coordinates of the sampling sites are given in table s1 the river water and sediment samples were collected during the high water period in april 2021 the samples were transported to the lab within 4 hours and the water quality parameters as well as the sediment properties were analyzed immediately see table s2 2 2 particle classification sediment particles were classified into seven fractions gravel 250 µm fine sand 50 250 µm silt 5 50 µm fine silt 1 5 µm submicron colloid 0 1 1 0 µm nano colloid 3 kda 0 1 µm and dissolved species 3 kda similarly the particles in the water samples were separated into three fractions including submicron colloid nano colloid and dissolved species the separation method was adapted from a technology for separating soil particles xu and guo 2017 and the detailed procedure was described in the supporting materials see text s1 briefly sieves were used to sieve gravel and fine sand settling columns were used to obtain silt centrifugation was adopted to obtain fine silt and submicron colloid and ultrafiltration centrifuge tubes ufc5003bk millipore usa with a 3 kda cutoff were used to separate nano colloid and dissolved species notably only species 3 kda were defined as the dissolved phase in this work while the cutoff size was 0 22 or 0 45 µm in the conventional treatments the ultrafiltration membranes were calibrated using standard macromolecules namely 1 3 kda vb12 and 67 kda bovine serum albumin see text s2 and fig s1 the particle sizes of the submicron colloid and nano colloid fractions were examined using a zetasizer nanozs 90 malvern instrument uk to check the validity of the separation method see fig s2 he et al 2023 2 3 colloid release after sediment disturbance sediments were the main u pollution source and the sediment u release was controlled by both hydrodynamic and hydrochemical factors dong et al 2021 a series of batch experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of disturbance intensity from 0 to 250 rpm oxygen 0 and 21 temperature from 5 to 35 c ph from 4 0 to 9 0 and four environment related salts nacl nahco3 cacl2 and na2so4 from 0 to 200 mm on sediment u release the serum bottle 60 ml was used in triplicate and each contained 7 ml of sediment and 35 ml of overlying water both sediment and overlying water were collected from the site r2 2 argon gas ar and deoxygenated water were supplied in the anaerobic group oxygen of 0 and air oxygen of approximately 21 was retained in all other groups the serum bottles were taken on a shaker under a condition of 150 rpm 20 c and ph 7 0 unless the parameter was studied after 6 h of shaking and another 6 h of settling the overlying water was sampled for the analysis of colloid and u content the residual sediment was collected for a tessier five step sequential extraction and the u speciation including exchangeable exc carbonate bound carb iron manganese oxides bound femnox organic matter bound om and residual res phases were determined see text s4 he et al 2019 2 4 simulated experiments of flowing and stationary rivers to simulate flowing rivers three rectangular channels were constructed each channel was 100 cm 3 cm 5 cm l w h with a bed slope of 1 see fig s3 overflow weirs were installed at the inlet and outlet in order to reduce the influence of the inlet and outlet on the flow regime in each channel 300 g of sediment was added uniformly and approximately 3 cm deep of overlying water was provided the flow rate was maintained at a given value by a peristaltic pump and the simulated rivers were in laminar reynolds 110 or 220 and turbulent conditions reynolds 1100 or 2200 see table s3 the reynolds number re was adopted to distinguish the flow regime and calculated as follows r e u r v where v is the kinematic viscosity m2 s u is the average velocity m s and r is the hydraulic radius m for open channel flow the flow regime is usually laminar when re 500 and turbulent when re 500 after ten hydraulic retention times hrt the overlying water was collected and analyzed for colloid and u content the fates of colloid and u in stationary waters were simulated in still beakers the sediment was shaken at 250 rpm for 6 h transferred to three 1 0 l beakers covered with gauze and settled in an incubator 20 c for 180 days the overlying water was periodically sampled and analyzed 2 5 colloid characterization the microstructural and composition of colloid particles were characterized using various advanced techniques including high angular angle dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy haadf stem and atomic force microscopy based nanoscale infrared spectroscopy afm nanoir the samples were dispersed onto a copper grid with pore like carbon films and an fei tecnai g2 f30 transmission electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscope eds philips fe instruments eindhoven holland was performed at an accelerating voltage of 300 kv moreover a scanning electron microscope sem equipped with eds hitachi s 4700 japan was used at an accelerating voltage of 15 kv to obtain sem eds mapping images afm nanoir analysis of nano colloidal particles was conducted using a nanoir2 system anasys instruments inc santa barbara usa the system operated a contact mode nir2 probe to obtain afm images and ir spectra in a range of 900 3600 cm 1 nanoir mapping images at different wavenumbers were collected in a 5 μm 5 μm scanning area with a resolution of 60 pixels per micron in both x and y axes 2 6 physical and chemical analyses the masses of different sediment particle fractions and water colloids were measured after classification after drying fine silt as well as larger particles were weighed directly by an electronic analytical balance the masses of colloidal particles were measured by spectrophotometry uv 1800 shimadzu japan at λ 680 nm there was a good linear relationship r2 0 998 between colloid concentration and their optical density od see fig s4 the total organic carbon toc of colloids was measured using a toc analyzer toc v cpn shimadzu japan the u contents in different fractions were determined the dissolved u was directly analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms plasma quant ms elite analytik jena ag germany particles were digested with hno3 hf hclo 4 4 1 mixture at 180 200 c and then the digestion solution was measured by icp ms considering the adsorption and retention of nano colloids on the ultrafiltration membrane the u content in nano colloids were calculated by subtracting the dissolved fraction from the suspension containing nano colloids and dissolved species the detailed procedure and quality assurance qa are shown in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 abundant nano colloidal u in river water and sediment three rivers located in the ili basin were investigated and the locations of the sampling sites are shown in fig 1 the total u concentration in the river water samples containing colloids ranged from 5 39 to 8 75 μg l with the highest u concentration at site r2 2 in all the tested water samples u was mainly distributed in the nano colloidal phase 50 2 68 4 84 μg l followed by the dissolved phase 2 09 3 45 μg l and the last in the submicron colloidal phase 0 32 0 56 μg l particle size analysis of the aqueous colloids showed that the river water contained 83 4 v v of submicron colloids and 16 6 of nano colloids fig s5a although the percentage of nano colloids was low their u content was up to 4 84 μg l while that in the submicron colloids was only 0 45 μg l the sediment samples at site r2 2 were analyzed for particle and metal distribution figs 2 and s6 as shown in fig 2 the smaller the particle size the higher the u content the colloidal particles 1 μm contained up to 27 6 4 2 μg g of u which was much higher than the average content of sediment u 4 1 0 2 μg g among the sediment colloids the nano colloidal u accounted for 70 23 see the inset of fig 2b the above finding showed that u preferentially accumulated in finer particles especially nano colloids this could be attributed to the fact that u in the river sediment was an exogenous contaminant and fine particles have high adsorption capacities for u due to their high specific surface areas yu et al 2021 the distributions of fe and al in sediment particles are shown in fig s6 and fe has a distribution similar to u 3 2 characterization of colloidal particles the microscopic morphology and chemical composition of the colloidal particles in river water were analyzed by haadf stem sem eds and afm nanoir techniques in figs 3 and s7 haadf stem and eds mapping images showed that submicron colloids and nano colloids had completely different morphologies and elemental compositions the submicron colloids contained many irregularly shaped crystal minerals fig 3a with elements o si c ca al and fe as the main constituents see fig 3c the nano colloids consisted of powdery substances fig 3d with only c and o as the major elements see figs 3f and s7f uranium was not detected in any of the samples due to its low contents the above findings suggested that submicron colloids might consist mainly of inorganic minerals such as clay minerals while nano colloids consisted mainly of particulate organic matter pom mccabe et al 2021 zheng et al 2020 the toc in the nano colloids accounted for 58 0 87 9 of the total carbon which also supported that the nano colloids contained abundant organic matter to assess the u uranyl ion adsorption characteristics of different colloids 4 mm of uranyl was added to the river water sample r2 2 after adsorption equilibrium the colloids were classified into submicron colloids and nano colloids the microscopic morphology and u distribution of different colloids were analyzed by haadf stem in fig s8 the results showed that the nano colloids adsorbed a large amount of u with a percentage of 50 2 w w fig s8d while that in the submicron colloids was only 13 5 w w fig s8b in the nano colloids u was uniformly distributed in the particles and was overlapped with the distributions of elements c and o fig s8c several previous studies also found a strong positive correlation between u and organic matter and they might have a strong affinity for each other bone et al 2017 parker et al 2022 in fig 4 the afm nanoir images showed the morphology and functional group distribution of the nano colloids in the afm image fig 4a there were two large clusters marked by white dashed lines they consisted of multiple small clusters of sizes ranging from tens of nanometers marked by green dashed lines original particles to one micron marked by yellow dashed lines primary clusters a similar agglomeration phenomenon has been found in previous studies on pom in which original particles first aggregated into primary clusters and then the primary clusters further aggregated into larger agglomerates mercadal et al 2021 in fig 4a five points were selected for single point ir analysis including four sample points marked by colored dots and one background point marked by a red triangle the results in fig 4b showed that the four sample points had similar infrared peaks at near 3400 cm 1 there was a very broad ir peak corresponding to the stretching vibration of oh the peaks at 2960 cm 1 and 2920 cm 1 were the stretching vibrations of aliphatic ch3 and ch2 respectively the peaks at 1450 1350 cm 1 were the bending vibrations of ch3 and ch2 the peak at 1730 cm 1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of the carbonyl group c o farber et al 2019 hernandez soriano et al 2018 the background point red curve had no significant ir peak in the tested range in the ir mapping images fig 4c the hydroxyl groups oh at 3400 cm 1 were widely distributed in the nano colloids and they might be derived from hydroxyl groups in organic matter or from bound water although the samples were freeze dried for 24 h before analysis some strongly bound water molecules would still be present in the nano colloids the groups c o ch3 and ch2 were relatively abundant indicating that the nano colloids consisted mainly of pom wang et al 2022b among them the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups are negatively charged and might be the adsorption sites for u uranyl cations bone et al 2017 the afm nanoir images of the submicron colloids are shown in fig s9 and organic functional groups were not detected in conclusion the nano colloids in the river water were mainly composed of pom which contained high levels of u some previous studies also found that high u contents often occurred in organic matter rich sediments and that u transport was associated with pom dublet et al 2019 parker et al 2022 the reasons for u accumulation on nano colloids were 1 the nano colloids had very high specific surface area due to small sizes and had high adsorption capacity for u see fig s8 2 the nano colloids were strongly negatively charged zeta potential of 41 7 2 2 mv and had strong electrostatic attraction to positively charged uranyl ions lan et al 2019 and 3 the surface of the nano colloids contained many functional groups including hydroxyl and carboxyl groups see fig 4 which provided many active sites for u adsorption and complexation parker et al 2022 3 3 colloidal u release from sediment in order to study the characteristics of sediment u release after physical disturbance the sediment and overlying water 1 4 v v were loaded into serum bottles and shaken at different rates after 6 h of shaking and 6 h of settling the colloid content and u distribution in the overlying water were measured by visual observation see fig s10 it was found that when the shaking rate was 100 rpm the mud water interface was present the supernatant was clear at 50 rpm and became blurred at 100 rpm when the shaking rate was greater than 100 rpm the mud water interface disappeared and sediment and water were fully mixed as shown in fig 5 a the release behavior of colloidal particles was consistent with the visual observation after the mud water was fully mixed 100 rpm the colloids started to release in large quantities this indicated that sediment disturbance was a prerequisite for the large release of colloids into the overlying water at the beginning the overlying water contained 15 0 0 5 μg l of nano colloidal u 6 6 1 1 μg l of dissolved u and 0 02 0 00 μg l of submicron colloidal u at a shaking rate of 50 rpm there was no increase of u in the overlying water indicating that the sediment did not release u when the shaking rate was 100 rpm the nano colloidal and dissolved u started to release and the submicron colloidal u was still not released at this shaking rate there was only a slight disturbance at the mud water interface at shaking rates of 100 rpm the submicron colloidal u started to release the nano colloidal u first increased and then stabilized and the dissolved u first increased and then decreased since the sediment total u decreased see fig 5b and the solution submicron colloidal u increased see fig 5a when the shaking rate increased from 150 to 250 rpm the decrease in dissolved u might be due to the adsorption of u onto the released submicron colloids these findings suggested that nano colloids were the predominant form of u release 55 70 and large amounts of nano colloidal u were released even if the sediment surface was only slightly disturbed however the role of submicron colloids cannot be ignored under strong perturbations after the above experiments the u content and speciation in the sediment were analyzed see fig 5b as the shaking rate increased from 0 to 250 rpm the total u content in the sediment decreased from 3 50 0 03 to 2 52 0 16 μg g the sediment u speciation showed a clear decrease in the exchangeable and organic matter bound u and an increase in the residual u this indicated that the u released from the sediment was mainly the exchangeable and organic matter bound u species the organic matter bound u might be released in the form of nano colloidal particles after sediment disturbance according to the above findings that the nano colloids were composed of pom 3 4 effects of environmental factors on u release the ili basin has special environmental conditions which may substantially influence the release of sediment u in the spring the snowmelt and glacier melt brings large amounts of cold and oxygen rich surface runoff the ili basin is saline alkaline soils and as runoff flows through the soil it carries salt and alkali into rivers therefore environmental conditions including oxygen temperature ph and salts were investigated in this study 3 4 1 oxygen the batch experiments were performed under aerobic approximately 21 of oxygen in headspace and anaerobic conditions in order to investigate the effect of oxygen on the release of sediment colloids and u in fig s11 the results showed that there was no significant difference between the two groups above indicating that oxygen did not change the u release behavior during the sediment perturbation 3 4 2 temperature to evaluate the effect of temperature on the release of sediment colloids and u batch experiments were performed at 150 rpm ph 7 0 and different temperatures 5 35 c in fig 6 a the releases of sediment colloids and submicron colloidal u increased slightly with an increasing temperature while that of nano colloidal u decreased substantially the nano colloidal u content decreased from 18 9 0 4 μg l 5 c to 8 4 0 9 μg l 35 c low temperatures were favorable for nano colloids to remain stable while high temperatures were prone to agglomeration angayarkanni and philip 2015 at high temperatures strong brownian motion and low water viscosity increased the chances of colloidal collisions wang et al 2017 thus promoting nano colloidal agglomeration 3 3 3 ph the release of sediment colloids and u as a function of ph 4 0 9 0 is depicted in fig 6b the release of sediment colloids and submicron colloidal u increased rapidly at ph 8 0 while the dissolved u decreased rapidly with the increasing ph under alkaline conditions ph 8 0 colloids carried more negative charges and colloidal particles repelled each other to be more stable thereby promoting the release of sediment colloids and submicron colloidal u wang et al 2020 the substantial decrease in dissolved u at high ph levels might be related to the formation of uranium containing hydroxides pan et al 2022 nano colloidal u was the highest 41 1 4 1 μg l under a neutral condition ph 7 0 and it decreased under both acidic and basic conditions lan et al 2019 velasco et al 2021 under acidic conditions the organic matter in nano colloids was commonly protonated which reduced the negative charge of nano colloids and made them more susceptible to agglomeration ge et al 2018 in addition this also caused the desorption of uranyl ions from the nano colloids under alkaline conditions some of the pom might dissolve thereby reducing the concentration of nano colloidal u velasco et al 2021 3 4 4 environment related salts a heat map analysis of water quality data from the three rivers is given in fig s12 the results showed that u was strongly correlated with ca2 hco3 and salinity indicating that ca2 hco3 and other environment related ions in the water had important effects on u release therefore batch experiments were conducted with different concentrations of four environment related salts nacl cacl2 nahco3 and na2so4 as shown in fig 6c the sediment colloids and submicron colloidal u release decreased largely with an increasing salt concentration among them cacl2 was the most effective in inhibiting colloids and submicron colloidal u release followed by nacl and na2so4 and the worst was nahco3 cations can compress the electrical double layer on the colloidal surface and improve agglomeration shao et al 2021 thereby inhibiting colloidal release comparing the results of cacl2 and nacl showed that divalent cations were more effective than monovalent cations at the same concentration of 10 mm the inhibition of colloidal release was 84 3 for cacl2 but only 4 2 for nacl this could be explained by the fact that ca2 ions promoted colloidal agglomeration through double layer compression charge neutralization and divalent cation bridging castan et al 2019 according to the results of nacl na2so4 and nahco3 it showed that anion cl was the most effective followed by so4 2 and hco3 was the least in fig 6c nahco3 substantially increased the release of nano colloidal and dissolved u after the addition of 50 mm nahco3 the release of nano colloidal and dissolved u increased by 6 6 and 7 3 times respectively however nahco3 did not increase the release of other elements in the sediment such as fe see fig s13d it is well known that co3 2 can complex with uranyl ions to form dissolved uranyl carbonate complexes riedel and kubeck 2018 which must lead to the desorption and release of sediment u since the nano colloids could adsorb carbonate see fig s14 a portion of the uranyl carbonate complexes might be adsorbed by the nano colloids yin et al 2021 which increased the nano colloidal u in addition hco3 could reduce the content of divalent ions such as ca2 which also promoted colloidal release in conclusion cations especially divalent cations can inhibit the release of colloidal u while hco3 can greatly promote the release of nano colloidal and dissolved u 3 5 simulated experiments of flowing and stationary rivers 3 5 1 colloidal u release in flowing rivers the effect of hydraulic conditions on the release of colloidal particles and u was investigated using the simulated river channels fig s3 as shown in fig 7 a the effect of flow velocity on sediment colloid release was small under laminar flow conditions re 110 220 however under turbulent flow conditions re 1100 2200 flow velocity had a strong effect on colloidal release at re 1100 the released colloid concentration was 0 04 0 01 g l while it increased to 0 09 0 01 g l at re 2200 under a turbulent flow regime the river water had a strong perturbation effect on the sediment due to the unsteady flow which enhanced the release of colloidal particles moreover aggregated colloids could be broken down into small colloids by fluid shear forces ling et al 2022 which would also increase colloids in water the release of dissolved u was influenced by the flow velocity under both laminar and turbulent flow regimes under a laminar flow regime the liquid film between the sediment and water became thinner with an increasing flow rate which facilitated the diffusion of dissolved species between sediment and water van dael et al 2021 overall nano colloidal u was the most abundant in the stimulated rivers which was consistent with the findings from the real rivers see fig 1 this again confirmed the important role of nano colloids in u release and transport in the rivers of the ili basin 3 5 2 aqueous u behavior in stationary waters the changes of the overlying water colloids and u were investigated in the simulated stationary waters as shown in fig 7b the initial content of colloidal particles in the overlying water was 0 55 0 01 g l which decreased to 0 06 0 01 g l after 10 days and stabilized at a low level of 0 01 0 00 g l after 150 days the trend of submicron colloidal u was consistent with that of colloidal particles nano colloidal u slightly increased from an initial 27 2 μg l to 32 1 μg l after 2 days and then decreased rapidly to a final level of 3 2 μg l dissolved u substantially decreased in the first 10 days but increased after 10 days dissolved u might adsorb on colloidal particles and be removed from water after particle settlement which could explain the decrease in the first 10 days the increase in dissolved u after 10 days might be due to the oxidation of u iv by air o2 which converted insoluble u iv into dissolved u vi and released dissolved u into the aqueous phase bone et al 2017 therefore during the dry periods when rivers do not flow or flow slowly dissolved u may become the main release pathway of sediment u in the ili basin 3 6 environmental significance of river nano colloidal u the ili basin has the most abundant river runoff in xinjiang with an average annual runoff of 1 53 1010 m3 based on the results in fig 1 the u migration through river runoff in the ili basin was estimated to be 82 134 t a of which the nano colloidal u was up to 41 74 t a snowmelt and glacier melt are the main sources of river runoff in this region which increases river flow and commonly causes snowmelt floods in spring jiang et al 2022 liu et al 2022 the low temperature and turbulent flow of river water will greatly increase the release and migration of nano colloidal u since these conditions improve nano colloidal generation and stability however spring is an important season for the growth of forage grasses and aquatic plants and the hazard of nano colloidal u to local flora fauna and humans may be seriously underestimated in the context of global warming glacial meltwater is increasing in the ili basin and the increased river flow will enhance sediment disturbance which promotes the generation of colloids and colloidal u furthermore the increased temperature will promote microbial metabolism and produce more inorganic carbon the inorganic carbon content will increase in river water and sediment pore water which may greatly promote the release and migration of nano colloidal u 4 conclusions the colloidal u release from the river sediment in the ili basin was studied and its influence factors were investigated uranium in the river water was mainly distributed in the nano colloidal phase 2 68 4 84 μg l which was obviously higher than the dissolved phase 2 09 3 45 μg l and submicron colloidal phase 0 32 0 56 μg l the nano colloids consisted mainly of pom which had a high adsorption capacity for u 70 23 of colloidal u large amounts of nano colloidal u were released after sediment disturbance and low temperature low salinity neutral ph high inorganic carbon and high flow rate facilitated nano colloidal u release according to the findings that increasing ca2 and ph could reduce the release of nano colloidal and dissolved u we proposed applying lime or quicklime around the open piles of u rich coal to interrupt the source

15303,functionalized antibiofouling membranes have attracted increasing attention in water and wastewater treatment among them contact killing antibiofouling membranes deliver a long lasting effect with no leaching or release thus providing distinctive advantages however the antibiofouling mechanism especially in the vicinity of the membrane surface remains unclear herein we demonstrate that mazef mediated programmed cell death pcd is critical for the antibiofouling behaviors of quaternary ammonium compounds modified membranes qm the viability of wild type escherichia coli wt e coli upon exposure to qm for 1 h was decreased dramatically 31 5 1 4 of the control in contrast the bacterial activity of e coli with the knockout of mazef gene ko e coli largely remained 85 8 5 2 through addition of quorum sensing factor i e extracellular death factor edf the antibacterial activity was significantly enhanced in a dilute culture indicating that the density dependent bacterial communication played an important role in the mazef mediated pcd system in biofouling control long term study further showed that qm exhibited a better antibiofouling performance to treat feedwater containing wt e coli especially when edf was dosed results of this study suggested that the bacteria on the membrane surface subject to contact killing could modulate the population growth in the vicinity via quorum sensing mazef mediated pcd paving a way to develop efficient antibiofouling materials based on contact killing scenarios graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords membrane technology biofouling quaternary ammonium compounds contact killing mazef mediated programmed cell death data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction polymeric microfiltration membranes have been widely used in water and wastewater treatment meng et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 zhu et al 2018 however fouling occurs inevitably during membrane filtration leading to increased energy consumption in operation and maintenance le clech et al 2006 lin et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 although intensive efforts have been dedicated to tailoring the physical and chemical properties of membranes to weaken the foulants membrane interactions long et al 2022 qi et al 2018 yin and deng 2015 zhang et al 2016a the microbial proliferation on membranes causes biofilm formation and biofouling which has limited the applications of membrane technologies for water and wastewater treatment an attractive alternative is to construct antibiofouling membranes in the presence of antimicrobial agents that can kill microbes by interfering with biochemical pathways thus hindering microbial proliferation and inhibiting biofilm formation among the various biocides used quaternary ammonium compounds qac that are compatible of polymeric membranes have attracted much attention on antibiofouling membranes fabrications liu et al 2017 sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2016b because the functionalized membranes can deactivate the microbes upon contact killing mechanism and avoid the depletion of biocides and risks of secondary pollution typically the microbial disorganization is driven by the electro donating and or hydrophobic interactions between ammonium groups and cell membranes when microorganisms get contact with the functionalized membrane surface banerjee et al 2011 murata et al 2007 however it is criticized that the contact killing depends on the exposure of the active surface sites i e qac some studies have shown that the antifouling performance would be compromised when the qac based membrane surface is covered with organic foulants which is deemed as a disadvantage of qac functionalized membranes as well as most contact killing dominated surfaces maan et al 2020 yu et al 2013 interestingly qac modified membranes have recently been reported to have a surprisingly durable antifouling activity when they are applied in a membrane bioreactor mbr for real municipal wastewater treatment chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2016b although the antibacterial activity of qac modified membrane was significantly decreased when the membrane surface was covered by abiotic foulants a biofilm covered membrane sample could maintain the antibacterial activity chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2016b 2016c 2018 for example covering the qac modified membrane surface by an abiotic alginate layer led to a residual antibacterial efficiency of 13 8 however after developing a biofilm of staphylococcus aureus of 30 μm in thickness the antibacterial efficiency of the membrane was maintained at 86 1 zhang et al 2016b it suggests that the traditional contact killing mechanisms are inaccurate to elucidate the antibiofouling performance of qac modified membranes therefore the indirect contact killing mechanism i e inhibiting biofilm growth by targeting the microorganisms in the vicinity of a membrane surface to cause further responses by the entire biofilm was put forward the biochemical interactions between the affected microorganisms on the membrane surface and those in the vicinity via sos signals transmission were supposed to play a key role in this indirect contact killing mechanism while these important findings may extend our capability to develop more effective antibiofouling membranes there are several critical issues to be systematically addressed i which kind of physiological pathway is involved in this process ii how is the cell communication regulated between the affected microorganisms on the membrane surface and those in the vicinity iii what are the underlying mechanisms accounting for biofilm formation motivated by these puzzles this study focuses on the investigation of the detailed physiological response in order to clarify its possible impacts on the antibiofouling performance of qac based membranes programmed cell death pcd termed as a process leading to a cell suicide is a normal physiological phenomenon in multicellular organisms ramisetty et al 2015 in pcd part of cells die due to the activation of certain cell death systems to favor the survival of the whole population jacobson et al 1997 yarmolinsky 1995 in these processes a well known system is the mazef toxin antitoxin ta system which is composed of a pair of genes that encode two opposite components interfering with the lethal action of the toxin mazef mediated pcd will be triggered by various stressful condition in which unstable antitoxin maze is degraded faster than the more stable toxin mazf kolodkin gal et al 2007 in such genetic modules involving pcd systems the population regulation requires the presence of quorum sensing factors called extracellular death factor edf furthermore mazef gene is quite common for the majority of bacteria in water and wastewater such as pseudomonas aeruginosa escherichia coli bacillus subtilis etc kumar and engelberg kulka 2014 in this work the role of mazef mediated pcd in the biofilm inhibition was investigated in detail for qac modified membranes aiming to further elucidate the indirect contact killing mechanisms batch and long term antibiofouling tests were conducted to reveal the impact of extracellular death factor edf on the population regulation in the biofilm formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains and peptidic molecules escherichia coli e coli has been reported to be used as a candidate for whole genome sequencing which help to investigate the functions of genes and serve as a guide for further experiment e coli strains used in this work included a wild type w3110 strain wt e coli and its mazef derivative ko e coli i e mazef gene knockout e coli the ko e coli was constructed using lambda red recombination technology at abiocenter biotechnology

ammonium chloride ddbac sigma aldrich u s a model qac with minimum bactericidal concentration mbc of 10 μg ml used in this study was dissolved in a dimethylsulfoxide dimethylacetamide dmso dmac sinopharm china solvent mixture 1 1 vol meanwhile 8 wt polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf solef 6020 u s and 8 wt polyethylene glycol 600 peg600 sinopharm china were dissolved in the above solution to obtain a homogeneous casting solution after stirred at 80 c overnight the degassed casting solution was coated on non woven fabrics and then immersed into a non solvent bath to form microfiltration membranes the control and qac modified membranes were termed cm and qm respectively membrane permeability was evaluated by a pressurized dead end filtration setup xu and chellam 2005 the surface and cross section membrane morphologies were observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy sem s 4800 hitachi japan and the pore size was analyzed by imagej software the successful immobilization of qac was determined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps axis ultradld kratos analytical ltd u k and streaming potential analyzer eka1 00 anton paar austria membrane contact angle

to characterize the membrane roughness 2 3 mazef mediated inhibition on cell growth in the presence of qac wt e coli and ko e coli were cultivated in m9 medium beijing boaohuayi biotechnology co ltd with shaking 100 rpm at 37 c overnight when the cultures reached the mid logarithmic phase od600 0 6 0 7 the bacterial suspensions were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 2 min and re suspended in m9 medium to calibrate the bacteria density i e od600 0 6 at 2 108 cells ml or od600 1 0 at 2 109 cells ml meanwhile a portion of the high density hd bacterial suspensions 2 108 cells ml or 2 109 cells ml were serially diluted to a low density ld 2 104 cells ml or 2 103 cells ml 0 1 g qac was dissolved in the 100 ml sterile phosphate buffered saline 1 g ml as stock solution to determine whether the mazef mediated pcd is involved in the antibacterial activity of qac modified membranes the cm and qm coupons 0 5 cm2 each treated by uv sterilization were immersed separately in contact with hd and ld bacterial suspensions of wt e coli and ko e coli for 1 4 h at 37 c after incubation the membranes were rinsed twice with phosphate buffered saline solution pbs 0 01 m ph 7 4 and then transferred into plastic tubes containing pbs 10 ml under sonication for 10 min in order to remove deposited bacteria from the membrane surface the number of colony forming units cfu was counted by plating of serial dilutions of the cell suspensions on agar substrates followed by incubation at 37 c overnight perreault et al 2014 further tests were carried out to explore the role of mazef in the qac mediated contact killing behaviors qac solutions with pre determined concentrations 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 μg ml were added into hd and ld bacterial suspensions of wt e coli and ko e coli respectively and then incubated in a rotary shaker at 100 rpm at 37 c with different incubation time t 0 5 2 4 and 6 h antibacterial efficiencies were evaluated by the cfu counting method as described above each sample was measured 3 times with an average value reported the influence of synthesized edf molecules on the qac mediated bactericidal behaviors was further evaluated to demonstrate the role of mazef edf pbs stock solution 1 mg ml was diluted in a range of 10 100 ng ml and then added into ld bacterial suspension of wt e coli and ko e coli subsequently a series of qac pbs solutions were mixed with the above ld bacterial suspensions in which edf molecules had been dosed ultimately the mixtures were incubated under the same conditions as described above the antibacterial activity as compared to the control was also assessed by the cfu counting method e coli cells apoptosis pathway was measured by annexin v fitc and pi staining chen et al 2020 briefly after exposure to qac 0 30 μg ml at 37 c for 0 5 and 4 h the hd bacteria suspensions were washed twice and re suspended in pbs solution 75 μl binding solution was firstly added into 10 μl bacterial suspension to enhance the fluorescence intensity subsequently 5 μl annexin v fitc and 10 μl pi were mixed into the above solution and then placed in a dark incubator for 30 min at 25 c finally the analysis of the cells was conducted by flow cytometry cytoflex lx beckman u s equipped with a flowjo software the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species ros by bacteria upon exposure 0 5 and 4 h to qac was measured by a ros detection kit containing h2dcf da life technologies u s han et al 2016 wang et al 2022 the detailed procedure is shown in si section s2 2 4 effects of the mazef system on biofilm formation long term antibiofouling behaviors were tested in cross flow filtration mode cms and qms each with 48 cm2 active membrane area were placed separately in four identical reactors with an effective volume of 0 96 l a diluted nutrient broth containing 106 cells ml wt e coli or ko e coli was used as the feed solution and the corresponding reactors were termed wt cm wt qm and kocm ko qm in which wt ko cm and qm represent wt e coli ko e coli cm and qm membranes respectively the systems were operated at a constant flux of 50 l m2 h at 25 1 c to evaluate whether edf is involved in the mazef mediated antibiofouling edf pbs solution 11 5 mg l 5 ml resulting in a dose of 57 5 μg d was directly fed into the reactor using a microinjection pump in the latter operation cycle at the end of each operation cycle the fouling layers 4 6 cm2 were scraped off from the membrane modules and collected to analyze the structure of the biofilm the bacterial activity in the fouling layers was characterized by adenosine triphosphate atp quantity using assay kit promega u s lim et al 2008 further information on the procedures can be found in si section s3 extracellular polymeric substances eps regarded as the sum of carbohydrates proteins and humic acids were extracted from biofilm by an ultrasonication centrifugation method han et al 2017 min et al 2022 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization strong signals at 402 ev in the xps spectrum of qm are associated with c n group suggesting the successful immobilization of qac fig s4 the membrane hydrophobicity was marginally increased mainly attributed to the alkyl chains of qac and a slight increase in the surface roughness of qm the membrane surface charge was significantly altered in the presence of qac i e 29 4 1 6 mv for cm and 13 3 2 4 mv for qm at ph 7 4 the increase of surface charge of qm is ascribed to the coverage of the positively charged qac on the membrane surface harney et al 2009 liu et al 2010 however the introduction of qac did not significantly affect the membrane morphology and pore size as compared to the control table 1 and fig s5 insignificant changes in the membrane permeabilities were also observed i e 45 4 0 6 l m2 h kpa and 41 9 2 5 l m2 h kpa of water permeability for cm and qm respectively 3 2 bactericidal activity the effect of mazef wt e coli and ko e coli were chosen as the model bacteria strains to investigate whether the mazef system responds to the bactericidal activity of the qac modified membrane qm the bacterial viability at an initial density of 108 cells ml and 109 cells ml is shown in figs 1a and s6a respectively the results from fig 1a indicate that the cfu of wt e coli subject to qm was significantly decreased the cell attachment within several hours is vital for the antibacterial efficiency of contact active surfaces at a short exposure period 1 h in qm the cfu of wt e coli was 31 5 1 4 as compared to the control while that of ko e coli was 85 8 5 2 when the exposure time increased to 4 h the cell viabilities of wt and ko e coli were decreased to 1 9 0 3 and 43 0 7 5 respectively these results suggested that mazef gene knockout substantially influenced the antibacterial efficiency of qm to further elucidate the mechanisms involved the antibacterial efficiency was determined for both bacteria strains upon exposure to free qac at different dosages and contact time at bacterial densities of 108 cells ml the bacterial activity of wt e coli was inhibited even in a short period exposure 2 h to qac at concentrations higher than 10 μg ml fig 1b in contrast the survival of ko e coli was observed under the same conditions suggesting that the mazef mediated pcd is the prevailing mode of response to a short time exposure of qac nevertheless with an increase in the exposure time dramatic loss of the cell viability of ko e coli was also observed for example while 71 2 5 5 cells were alive when ko e coli were exposed to 15 μg qac ml for 2 h the survival of ko e coli was decreased to 13 8 4 when the contact time was extended to 6 h the results indicated that other mechanisms except for mazef mediated pcd would contribute to the antibacterial effect of qac under extremely stressful conditions the production of intracellular ros was determined to investigate the function of the mazef system in e coli fig 2a at a short exposure time 0 5 h the intracellular ros levels in wt e coli increased with an increase in the qac concentration showing an qac dose dependent ros accumulation profile in contrast the ros levels in ko e coli were much lower than those in the wt strain similar trends were observed when both bacteria strains were exposed to qac for 4 h meanwhile the bacterial exposure time affected the production of ros and higher values were observed at a longer duration for both wt and ko e coli these results indicated that the mazef mediated pcd in e coli could be possibly caused by an increase in ros accumulation similar to the antibiotic mediated inhibition of transcription or translation in an ros dependent manner belitsky et al 2011 dai et al 2021 it should be noted that when the stress was excessive the accumulated intra ros may directly deactivate ko e coli in the absence of the mazef system the flow cytometry analysis using annexin v fitc pi staining was carried out to further elucidate the bacterial cell death upon exposure to qac figs 2b and s7 the large percentage of apoptotic cells 31 38 was found in the wt strain upon exposure to 10 μg ml qac for a short time 0 5 h with necrotic cells accounting for 6 12 in contrast a relatively low number of cells was stained for ko e coli in a wide range of qac concentrations which was consistent with the results from fig 1b following exposure for 4 h the percentage of necrotic cells significantly increased for both strains according to previous studies demirbas 2008 hazan et al 2004 nigam et al 2019 the mazef mediated pcd is sensitive to a short exposure upon stressful conditions minute level such as high temperatures and ros mediated stress if the stress is stronger the necrosis that is mostly considered to be an accidental cell death would play a key role in response li et al 2015 sun et al 2013 in this case the mazef mediated pcd is only partially responsible for the bacterial inactivation the cells death though necrosis is not able to regulate biofilm since no quorum sensing factors e g edf are produced which might not induce indirect contact killing antibiofouling mechanism and thus lead to aggravated membrane fouling considering the dose dependent bactericidal profile of free qac and qm performance the contact killing antibiofouling mechanism of qm is supposed to be contributed by the coverage of qac on the membrane surface the hypothesis that an excessive qac dose in membrane fabrication aggravates biofouling is plausible as the necrosis would dominate the process for example when the dose of qac reached 0 4 wt approximately 2 4 mg qac cm2 the adhesion and growth of the biofilm was promoted on the membrane zhang et al 2016c based on the balance between the positive and negative impacts on bactericidal activities e g pcd and necrosis a surface load of 1 2 mg cm2 is suggested for qac modified membranes for biofouling control mazef mediated pcd provides a guideline for the dose of the contact active biocides in antibiofouling membrane fabrications 3 3 density dependent antibacterial mechanisms the role of edf the mazef mediated cell death requires a quorum sensing extracellular death factor edf which is dependent on the density of bacterial population demirbas 2008 kumar et al 2016 to verify the relationship between antibacterial activity of qm and mazef mediated pcd the antibacterial activity of both strains at a low bacterial density 104 cells ml or 103 cells ml was therefore investigated compared with the results from figs 1a and s6a the qac modified membrane qm exhibited less antibacterial activity to wt e coli figs 3a and s6b p 0 05 additionally there was minimal difference between the cfu of wt and ko e coli upon exposure to cm or qm at low bacterial density 104 cells ml further evidence elucidating the impact of population density on the bactericidal activity of qac came from the free qac tests fig 3b the exposure to qac of 0 30 μg ml for 0 5 h did not affect the activity of wt e coli which is inconsistent with the results obtained at a high bacterial density the bactericidal function of qac has shown a relationship with the bacterial population density with an increase in the contact time the deactivation of both e coli strains became more dominant nevertheless the antibacterial efficiency was less significant as compared with the results presented in fig 1b especially under extremely stressful conditions e g exposure time 2 h and qac concentration 10 μg ml meanwhile the exposure to free qac resulted in no obvious difference between wt and ko e coli strains in terms of the antibacterial efficiencies at low bacterial density fig 3b the results indicated that the antibacterial activity of qac regulated by the mazef system significantly depended on the bacterial population density to test the effect of edf on the antibacterial behaviors of qac a linear synthetic edf peptide which is considered as a kind of quorum sensing signal molecules in mazef ta system nigam et al 2018 was added to the diluted wt e coli culture 104 cells ml the results from esi ms and hplc confirmed the successful synthesis of edf si figs s8 and s9 as can be seen from fig 4 the antibacterial efficiency was enhanced in the presence of edf moreover the cell viability was less sensitive to the addition of edf with an increase in the exposure time after exposure to qac for 6 h the gap between the blue and orange line became less significant as compared to that at 0 5 4 h this is another example that the mazef mediated cell death is less dominant under severe conditions as other death mechanisms such as necrosis may play a role in the process fig 2b it should be noted that no edf response was observed in ko e coli over a wide range of edf dose si fig s10 overall it can be concluded that e coli mazef mediated cell death induced by qac was dependent on the density of the bacterial population bacterial communication via the autoinducer edf provides a mechanism for affected bacteria to monitor other s presence and to modulate the physiological functions this likely contributes to the antibacterial activity of qac modified membrane however if the stressful condition becomes extremely severe e g high ros accumulation at extended exposure time and or high qac dose the necrosis or other death mechanisms may become dominant to cause the bacteria death we propose the following mechanism possibly accounting for qac modified membrane s antibacterial activity fig 5 exposure of bacteria e g wt e coli to the immobilized bactericides qac on membranes may lead to the inhibition of transcription and or translation via ros dependent manner sat et al 2001 thus triggering mazef mediated toxin antitoxin pcd the antitoxin maze encoded by maze is more labile and its degradation by ros would result in the accumulation of a sequence specific endoribonuclease mazf belitsky et al 2011 mazef mediated pcd will be triggered by stressful condition in which unstable antitoxin maze is degraded faster than the more stable toxin mazf when the mazf toxin of the affected bacteria on the membrane takes effect bacterial communication with those in the vicinity could occur via a quorum sensing factor edf engelberg kulka et al 2006 kumar et al 2016 these bacteria can act as a multicellular organism a subpopulation in which dies to permit the survival of the community as a whole according to the previous study belitsky et al 2011 edf has a strong affinity with mazf and could displace maze by mimicking its binding to mazf leading to the consequent enhancement of mazf toxin fig 5 in contrast to the mechanism observed in a suspended system in which the death of a subpopulation may facilitate the biofilm growth due to the release of nutrients the dense bacteria culture on the membrane is subject to the qac exposed on the membranes thus preventing the further development of biofilm also the activity of edf has density dependence on the population and a higher bacterial concentration is more readily to trigger the antibacterial activity when mazef is knocked out the mazef mediated pcd is excluded from the system and the bacterial population is less challenged by the stressful condition induced by qac modified membrane 3 4 long term study of mazef mediated pcd using qm long term experiments were further conducted to examine the role of mazef mediated pcd in retarding biofilm development on the qac modified membrane fig 6a shows the variations of trans membrane pressure tmp of qm and cm as a function of operation time the feed solution contained wt or ko e coli in the second operating cycle edf was added to evaluate its effect on the biofilm growth in agreement with the results of batch experiments qm exhibited a much better performance against biofouling induced by both bacterial stains than cm in the operating cycles it suggests that the immobilized qac and its associated antibacterial efficiency ensure lasting effectiveness against biofouling in spite of a slight loss of membrane properties table 1 in the absence of edf the tmp increase rate of qm treating the feed of wt e coli was 1 63 kpa d and it was reduced to 1 29 kpa d by 20 8 when edf was added into the system suggesting that the presence of edf contributed to biofouling alleviation in qm reactor in contrast qm exhibited a lower efficiency against biofouling induced by ko e coli in the first operation cycle without edf the tmp increase rate of qm treating the feed of ko e coli was 2 06 kpa d furthermore there was no obvious difference of the tmp increase rate between the first and second cycles i e 1 94 kpa d for qm treating feedwater containing ko e coli this implies that qm was insensitive to the addition of edf when ko e coli was present in the feed solution at the end of the operation cycles the atp activities of bacteria in the biofilm were measured fig 6b atp values that reflect the metabolism behaviors have a positive relationship with the live cells counting when ko e coli was present in the feed solution there was no significant difference of atp content between the first without edf and second with edf runs in comparison the atp activity in the biofilm of wt e coli was substantially decreased when edf was applied indicating that mazef system was responsible for the antibiofouling effect of qm a similar conclusion can be drawn with regard to the eps concentrations in the biofilm the eps concentrations in the biofilm the sum of the polysaccharides protein and humic acid in the biofilm ding et al 2016 yeon et al 2009 yu et al 2016 showed similar trend to atp changes fig 6c taken together the results suggest that mazef mediated cell death via quorum sensing plays a critical role in biofouling mitigation due to growth inhibition and cell death on the membrane surface fig 5 furthermore the lifespan of qac modified membranes is expected to be extended by adding quorum sensing autoinducer edf in mbrs which needs further investigation 4 conclusions in this work a physiological stress mediated response mazef mediated pcd has been found to be vital for the antibacterial and antibiofouling behaviors of qac modified membranes upon contact with qac active layer that triggered mazef the affected cells can regulate population in which bacterial cells communicate with each other through a quorum sensing autoinducer edf leading to the inhibition of biofilm growth on the contrary when mazef is knocked out the mazef mediated pcd is excluded from the system and the bacterial population is less challenged by the stressful condition induced by qac modified membrane further investigation of mazef mediated pcd systems upon cooperation of mixed bacteria culture e g mbrs and relevant influencing factors e g sludge concentration is required in order to extend the application of antibiofouling membranes the proposed mechanism can provide a new

15303,functionalized antibiofouling membranes have attracted increasing attention in water and wastewater treatment among them contact killing antibiofouling membranes deliver a long lasting effect with no leaching or release thus providing distinctive advantages however the antibiofouling mechanism especially in the vicinity of the membrane surface remains unclear herein we demonstrate that mazef mediated programmed cell death pcd is critical for the antibiofouling behaviors of quaternary ammonium compounds modified membranes qm the viability of wild type escherichia coli wt e coli upon exposure to qm for 1 h was decreased dramatically 31 5 1 4 of the control in contrast the bacterial activity of e coli with the knockout of mazef gene ko e coli largely remained 85 8 5 2 through addition of quorum sensing factor i e extracellular death factor edf the antibacterial activity was significantly enhanced in a dilute culture indicating that the density dependent bacterial communication played an important role in the mazef mediated pcd system in biofouling control long term study further showed that qm exhibited a better antibiofouling performance to treat feedwater containing wt e coli especially when edf was dosed results of this study suggested that the bacteria on the membrane surface subject to contact killing could modulate the population growth in the vicinity via quorum sensing mazef mediated pcd paving a way to develop efficient antibiofouling materials based on contact killing scenarios graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords membrane technology biofouling quaternary ammonium compounds contact killing mazef mediated programmed cell death data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction polymeric microfiltration membranes have been widely used in water and wastewater treatment meng et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 zhu et al 2018 however fouling occurs inevitably during membrane filtration leading to increased energy consumption in operation and maintenance le clech et al 2006 lin et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 although intensive efforts have been dedicated to tailoring the physical and chemical properties of membranes to weaken the foulants membrane interactions long et al 2022 qi et al 2018 yin and deng 2015 zhang et al 2016a the microbial proliferation on membranes causes biofilm formation and biofouling which has limited the applications of membrane technologies for water and wastewater treatment an attractive alternative is to construct antibiofouling membranes in the presence of antimicrobial agents that can kill microbes by interfering with biochemical pathways thus hindering microbial proliferation and inhibiting biofilm formation among the various biocides used quaternary ammonium compounds qac that are compatible of polymeric membranes have attracted much attention on antibiofouling membranes fabrications liu et al 2017 sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2016b because the functionalized membranes can deactivate the microbes upon contact killing mechanism and avoid the depletion of biocides and risks of secondary pollution typically the microbial disorganization is driven by the electro donating and or hydrophobic interactions between ammonium groups and cell membranes when microorganisms get contact with the functionalized membrane surface banerjee et al 2011 murata et al 2007 however it is criticized that the contact killing depends on the exposure of the active surface sites i e qac some studies have shown that the antifouling performance would be compromised when the qac based membrane surface is covered with organic foulants which is deemed as a disadvantage of qac functionalized membranes as well as most contact killing dominated surfaces maan et al 2020 yu et al 2013 interestingly qac modified membranes have recently been reported to have a surprisingly durable antifouling activity when they are applied in a membrane bioreactor mbr for real municipal wastewater treatment chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2016b although the antibacterial activity of qac modified membrane was significantly decreased when the membrane surface was covered by abiotic foulants a biofilm covered membrane sample could maintain the antibacterial activity chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2016b 2016c 2018 for example covering the qac modified membrane surface by an abiotic alginate layer led to a residual antibacterial efficiency of 13 8 however after developing a biofilm of staphylococcus aureus of 30 μm in thickness the antibacterial efficiency of the membrane was maintained at 86 1 zhang et al 2016b it suggests that the traditional contact killing mechanisms are inaccurate to elucidate the antibiofouling performance of qac modified membranes therefore the indirect contact killing mechanism i e inhibiting biofilm growth by targeting the microorganisms in the vicinity of a membrane surface to cause further responses by the entire biofilm was put forward the biochemical interactions between the affected microorganisms on the membrane surface and those in the vicinity via sos signals transmission were supposed to play a key role in this indirect contact killing mechanism while these important findings may extend our capability to develop more effective antibiofouling membranes there are several critical issues to be systematically addressed i which kind of physiological pathway is involved in this process ii how is the cell communication regulated between the affected microorganisms on the membrane surface and those in the vicinity iii what are the underlying mechanisms accounting for biofilm formation motivated by these puzzles this study focuses on the investigation of the detailed physiological response in order to clarify its possible impacts on the antibiofouling performance of qac based membranes programmed cell death pcd termed as a process leading to a cell suicide is a normal physiological phenomenon in multicellular organisms ramisetty et al 2015 in pcd part of cells die due to the activation of certain cell death systems to favor the survival of the whole population jacobson et al 1997 yarmolinsky 1995 in these processes a well known system is the mazef toxin antitoxin ta system which is composed of a pair of genes that encode two opposite components interfering with the lethal action of the toxin mazef mediated pcd will be triggered by various stressful condition in which unstable antitoxin maze is degraded faster than the more stable toxin mazf kolodkin gal et al 2007 in such genetic modules involving pcd systems the population regulation requires the presence of quorum sensing factors called extracellular death factor edf furthermore mazef gene is quite common for the majority of bacteria in water and wastewater such as pseudomonas aeruginosa escherichia coli bacillus subtilis etc kumar and engelberg kulka 2014 in this work the role of mazef mediated pcd in the biofilm inhibition was investigated in detail for qac modified membranes aiming to further elucidate the indirect contact killing mechanisms batch and long term antibiofouling tests were conducted to reveal the impact of extracellular death factor edf on the population regulation in the biofilm formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains and peptidic molecules escherichia coli e coli has been reported to be used as a candidate for whole genome sequencing which help to investigate the functions of genes and serve as a guide for further experiment e coli strains used in this work included a

ammonium chloride ddbac sigma aldrich u s a model qac with minimum bactericidal concentration mbc of 10 μg ml used in this study was dissolved in a dimethylsulfoxide dimethylacetamide dmso dmac

obtain a homogeneous casting solution after stirred at 80 c overnight the degassed casting solution was coated on non woven fabrics and then immersed into a non solvent bath to form microfiltration membranes the control and qac modified membranes were termed cm and qm respectively membrane permeability was evaluated by a pressurized dead end filtration setup xu and chellam 2005 the surface and cross section membrane morphologies were observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy sem s 4800 hitachi japan and the pore size was analyzed by imagej software the successful immobilization of qac was determined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps axis ultradld kratos analytical ltd u k and streaming potential analyzer eka1 00 anton paar austria membrane contact angle

with shaking 100 rpm at 37 c overnight when the cultures reached the mid logarithmic phase od600 0 6 0 7 the bacterial suspensions were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 2 min and re suspended in m9 medium to calibrate the bacteria density i e od600 0 6 at 2 108 cells ml or od600 1 0 at 2 109 cells ml meanwhile a portion of the high density hd bacterial suspensions 2 108 cells ml or 2 109 cells ml were serially diluted to a low density ld 2 104 cells ml or 2 103 cells ml 0 1 g qac was dissolved in the 100 ml sterile phosphate buffered saline 1 g ml as stock solution to determine whether the mazef mediated pcd is involved in the antibacterial activity of qac modified membranes the cm and qm coupons 0 5 cm2 each treated by uv sterilization were immersed separately in contact with hd and ld bacterial suspensions of wt e coli and ko e coli for 1 4 h at 37 c after incubation the membranes were rinsed twice with phosphate buffered saline solution pbs 0 01 m ph 7 4 and then transferred into plastic tubes containing pbs 10 ml under sonication for 10 min in order to remove deposited bacteria from the membrane surface the number of colony forming units cfu was counted by plating of serial dilutions of the cell suspensions on agar substrates followed by incubation at 37 c overnight perreault et al 2014 further tests were carried out to explore the role of mazef in the qac mediated contact killing behaviors qac solutions with pre determined concentrations 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 μg ml were added into hd and ld bacterial suspensions of wt e coli and ko e coli respectively and then incubated in a rotary shaker at 100 rpm at 37 c with different incubation time t 0 5 2 4 and 6 h antibacterial efficiencies were evaluated by the cfu counting method as described above each sample was measured 3 times with an average value reported the influence of synthesized edf molecules on the qac mediated bactericidal behaviors was further evaluated to demonstrate the role of mazef edf pbs stock solution 1 mg ml was diluted in a range of 10 100 ng ml and then added into ld bacterial suspension of wt e coli and ko e coli subsequently a series of qac pbs solutions were mixed with the above ld bacterial suspensions in which edf molecules had been dosed ultimately the mixtures were incubated under the same conditions as described above the antibacterial activity as compared to the control was also assessed by the cfu counting method e coli cells apoptosis pathway was measured by annexin v fitc and pi staining chen et al 2020 briefly after exposure to qac 0 30 μg ml at 37 c for 0 5 and 4 h the hd bacteria suspensions were washed twice and re suspended in pbs solution 75 μl binding solution was firstly added into 10 μl bacterial suspension to enhance the fluorescence intensity subsequently 5 μl annexin v fitc and 10 μl pi were mixed into the above solution and then placed in a dark incubator for 30 min at 25 c finally the analysis of the cells was conducted by flow cytometry cytoflex lx beckman u s equipped with a flowjo software the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species ros by bacteria upon exposure 0 5 and 4 h to qac was measured by a ros detection kit containing h2dcf da life technologies u s han et al 2016 wang et al 2022 the detailed procedure is shown in si section s2 2 4 effects of the mazef system on biofilm formation long term antibiofouling behaviors were tested in cross flow filtration mode cms and qms each with 48 cm2 active membrane area were placed separately in four identical reactors with an effective volume of 0 96 l a diluted nutrient broth containing 106 cells ml wt e coli or ko e coli was used as the feed solution and the corresponding reactors were termed wt cm wt qm and kocm ko qm in which wt ko cm and qm represent wt e coli ko e coli cm and qm membranes respectively the systems were operated at a constant flux of 50 l m2 h at 25 1 c to evaluate whether edf is involved in the mazef mediated antibiofouling edf pbs solution 11 5 mg l 5 ml resulting in a dose of 57 5 μg d was directly fed into the reactor using a microinjection pump in the latter operation cycle at the end of each operation cycle the fouling layers 4 6 cm2 were scraped off from the membrane modules and collected to analyze the structure of the biofilm the bacterial activity in the fouling layers was characterized by adenosine triphosphate atp quantity using assay kit promega u s lim et al 2008 further information on the procedures can be found in si section s3 extracellular polymeric substances eps regarded as the sum of carbohydrates proteins and humic acids were extracted from biofilm by an ultrasonication centrifugation method han et al 2017 min et al 2022 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization strong signals at 402 ev in the xps spectrum of qm are associated with c n group suggesting the successful immobilization of qac fig s4 the membrane hydrophobicity was marginally increased mainly attributed to the alkyl chains of qac and a slight increase in the surface roughness of qm the membrane surface charge was significantly altered in the presence of qac i e 29 4 1 6 mv for cm and 13 3 2 4 mv for qm at ph 7 4 the increase of surface charge of qm is ascribed to the coverage of the positively charged qac on the membrane surface harney et al 2009 liu et al 2010 however the introduction of qac did not significantly affect the membrane morphology and pore size as compared to the control table 1 and fig s5 insignificant changes in the membrane permeabilities were also observed i e 45 4 0 6 l m2 h kpa and 41 9 2 5 l m2 h kpa of water permeability for cm and qm respectively 3 2 bactericidal activity the effect of mazef wt e coli and ko e coli were chosen as the model bacteria strains to investigate whether the mazef system responds to the bactericidal activity of the qac modified membrane qm the bacterial viability at an initial density of 108 cells ml and 109 cells ml is shown in figs 1a and s6a respectively the results from fig 1a indicate that the cfu of wt e coli subject to qm was significantly decreased the cell attachment within several hours is vital for the antibacterial efficiency of contact active surfaces at a short exposure period 1 h in qm the cfu of wt e coli was 31 5 1 4 as compared to the control while that of ko e coli was 85 8 5 2 when the exposure time increased to 4 h the cell viabilities of wt and ko e coli were decreased to 1 9 0 3 and 43 0 7 5 respectively these results suggested that mazef gene knockout substantially influenced the antibacterial efficiency of qm to further elucidate the mechanisms involved the antibacterial efficiency was determined for both bacteria strains upon exposure to free qac at different dosages and contact time at bacterial densities of 108 cells ml the bacterial activity of wt e coli was inhibited even in a short period exposure 2 h to qac at concentrations higher than 10 μg ml fig 1b in contrast the survival of ko e coli was observed under the same conditions suggesting that the mazef mediated pcd is the prevailing mode of response to a short time exposure of qac nevertheless with an increase in the exposure time dramatic loss of the cell viability of ko e coli was also observed for example while 71 2 5 5 cells were alive when ko e coli were exposed to 15 μg qac ml for 2 h the survival of ko e coli was decreased to 13 8 4 when the contact time was extended to 6 h the results indicated that other mechanisms except for mazef mediated pcd would contribute to the antibacterial effect of qac under extremely stressful conditions the production of intracellular ros was determined to investigate the function of the mazef system in e coli fig 2a at a short exposure time 0 5 h the intracellular ros levels in wt e coli increased with an increase in the qac concentration showing an qac dose dependent ros accumulation profile in contrast the ros levels in ko e coli were much lower than those in the wt strain similar trends were observed when both bacteria strains were exposed to qac for 4 h meanwhile the bacterial exposure time affected the production of ros and higher values were observed at a longer duration for both wt and ko e coli these results indicated that the mazef mediated pcd in e coli could be possibly caused by an increase in ros accumulation similar to the antibiotic mediated inhibition of transcription or translation in an ros dependent manner belitsky et al 2011 dai et al 2021 it should be noted that when the stress was excessive the accumulated intra ros may directly deactivate ko e coli in the absence of the mazef system the flow cytometry analysis using annexin v fitc pi staining was carried out to further elucidate the bacterial cell death upon exposure to qac figs 2b and s7 the large percentage of apoptotic cells 31 38 was found in the wt strain upon exposure to 10 μg ml qac for a short time 0 5 h with necrotic cells accounting for 6 12 in contrast a relatively low number of cells was stained for ko e coli in a wide range of qac concentrations which was consistent with the results from fig 1b following exposure for 4 h the percentage of necrotic cells significantly increased for both strains according to previous studies demirbas 2008 hazan et al 2004 nigam et al 2019 the mazef mediated pcd is sensitive to a short exposure upon stressful conditions minute level such as high temperatures and ros mediated stress if the stress is stronger the necrosis that is mostly considered to be an accidental cell death would play a key role in response li et al 2015 sun et al 2013 in this case the mazef mediated pcd is only partially responsible for the bacterial inactivation the cells death though necrosis is not able to regulate biofilm since no quorum sensing factors e g edf are produced which might not induce indirect contact killing antibiofouling mechanism and thus lead to aggravated membrane fouling considering the dose dependent bactericidal profile of free qac and qm performance the contact killing antibiofouling mechanism of qm is supposed to be contributed by the coverage of qac on the membrane surface the hypothesis that an excessive qac dose in membrane fabrication aggravates biofouling is plausible as the necrosis would dominate the process for example when the dose of qac reached 0 4 wt approximately 2 4 mg qac cm2 the adhesion and growth of the biofilm was promoted on the membrane zhang et al 2016c based on the balance between the positive and negative impacts on bactericidal activities e g pcd and necrosis a surface load of 1 2 mg cm2 is suggested for qac modified membranes for biofouling control mazef mediated pcd provides a guideline for the dose of the contact active biocides in antibiofouling membrane fabrications 3 3 density dependent antibacterial mechanisms the role of edf the mazef mediated cell death requires a quorum sensing extracellular death factor edf which is dependent on the density of bacterial population demirbas 2008 kumar et al 2016 to verify the relationship between antibacterial activity of qm and mazef mediated pcd the antibacterial activity of both strains at a low bacterial density 104 cells ml or 103 cells ml was therefore investigated compared with the results from figs 1a and s6a the qac modified membrane qm exhibited less antibacterial activity to wt e coli figs 3a and s6b p 0 05 additionally there was minimal difference between the cfu of wt and ko e coli upon exposure to cm or qm at low bacterial density 104 cells ml further evidence elucidating the impact of population density on the bactericidal activity of qac came from the free qac tests fig 3b the exposure to qac of 0 30 μg ml for 0 5 h did not affect the activity of wt e coli which is inconsistent with the results obtained at a high bacterial density the bactericidal function of qac has shown a relationship with the bacterial population density with an increase in the contact time the deactivation of both e coli strains became more dominant nevertheless the antibacterial efficiency was less significant as compared with the results presented in fig 1b especially under extremely stressful conditions e g exposure time 2 h and qac concentration 10 μg ml meanwhile the exposure to free qac resulted in no obvious difference between wt and ko e coli strains in terms of the antibacterial efficiencies at low bacterial density fig 3b the results indicated that the antibacterial activity of qac regulated by the mazef system significantly depended on the bacterial population density to test the effect of edf on the antibacterial behaviors of qac a linear synthetic edf peptide which is considered as a kind of quorum sensing signal molecules in mazef ta system nigam et al 2018 was added to the diluted wt e coli culture 104 cells ml the results from esi ms and hplc confirmed the successful synthesis of edf si figs s8 and s9 as can be seen from fig 4 the antibacterial efficiency was enhanced in the presence of edf moreover the cell viability was less sensitive to the addition of edf with an increase in the exposure time after exposure to qac for 6 h the gap between the blue and orange line became less significant as compared to that at 0 5 4 h this is another example that the mazef mediated cell death is less dominant under severe conditions as other death mechanisms such as necrosis may play a role in the process fig 2b it should be noted that no edf response was observed in ko e coli over a wide range of edf dose si fig s10 overall it can be concluded that e coli mazef mediated cell death induced by qac was dependent on the density of the bacterial population bacterial communication via the autoinducer edf provides a mechanism for affected bacteria to monitor other s presence and to modulate the physiological functions this likely contributes to the antibacterial activity of qac modified membrane however if the stressful condition becomes extremely severe e g high ros accumulation at extended exposure time and or high qac dose the necrosis or other death mechanisms may become dominant to cause the bacteria death we propose the following mechanism possibly accounting for qac modified membrane s antibacterial activity fig 5 exposure of bacteria e g wt e coli to the immobilized bactericides qac on membranes may lead to the inhibition of transcription and or translation via ros dependent manner sat et al 2001 thus triggering mazef mediated toxin antitoxin pcd the antitoxin maze encoded by maze is more labile and its degradation by ros would result in the accumulation of a sequence specific endoribonuclease mazf belitsky et al 2011 mazef mediated pcd will be triggered by stressful condition in which unstable antitoxin maze is degraded faster than the more stable toxin mazf when the mazf toxin of the affected bacteria on the membrane takes effect bacterial communication with those in the vicinity could occur via a quorum sensing factor edf engelberg kulka et al 2006 kumar et al 2016 these bacteria can act as a multicellular organism a subpopulation in which dies to permit the survival of the community as a whole according to the previous study belitsky et al 2011 edf has a strong affinity with mazf and could displace maze by mimicking its binding to mazf leading to the consequent enhancement of mazf toxin fig 5 in contrast to the mechanism observed in a suspended system in which the death of a subpopulation may facilitate the biofilm growth due to the release of nutrients the dense bacteria culture on the membrane is subject to the qac exposed on the membranes thus preventing the further development of biofilm also the activity of edf has density dependence on the population and a higher bacterial concentration is more readily to trigger the antibacterial activity when mazef is knocked out the mazef mediated pcd is excluded from the system and the bacterial population is less challenged by the stressful condition induced by qac modified membrane 3 4 long term study of mazef mediated pcd using qm long term experiments were further conducted to examine the role of mazef mediated pcd in retarding biofilm development on the qac modified membrane fig 6a shows the variations of trans membrane pressure tmp of qm and cm as a function of operation time the feed solution contained wt or ko e coli in the second operating cycle edf was added to evaluate its effect on the biofilm growth in agreement with the results of batch experiments qm exhibited a much better performance against biofouling induced by both bacterial stains than cm in the operating cycles it suggests that the immobilized qac and its associated antibacterial efficiency ensure lasting effectiveness against biofouling in spite of a slight loss of membrane properties table 1 in the absence of edf the tmp increase rate of qm treating the feed of wt e coli was 1 63 kpa d and it was reduced to 1 29 kpa d by 20 8 when edf was added into the system suggesting that the presence of edf contributed to biofouling alleviation in qm reactor in contrast qm exhibited a lower efficiency against biofouling induced by ko e coli in the first operation cycle without edf the tmp increase rate of qm treating the feed of ko e coli was 2 06 kpa d furthermore there was no obvious difference of the tmp increase rate between the first and second cycles i e 1 94 kpa d for qm treating feedwater containing ko e coli this implies that qm was insensitive to the addition of edf when ko e coli was present in the feed solution at the end of the operation cycles the atp activities of bacteria in the biofilm were measured fig 6b atp values that reflect the metabolism behaviors have a positive relationship with the live cells counting when ko e coli was present in the feed solution there was no significant difference of atp content between the first without edf and second with edf runs in comparison the atp activity in the biofilm of wt e coli was substantially decreased when edf was applied indicating that mazef system was responsible for the antibiofouling effect of qm a similar conclusion can be drawn with regard to the eps concentrations in the biofilm the eps concentrations in the biofilm the sum of the polysaccharides protein and humic acid in the biofilm ding et al 2016 yeon et al 2009 yu et al 2016 showed similar trend to atp changes fig 6c taken together the results suggest that mazef mediated cell death via quorum sensing plays a critical role in biofouling mitigation due to growth inhibition and cell death on the membrane surface fig 5 furthermore the lifespan of qac modified membranes is expected to be extended by adding quorum sensing autoinducer edf in mbrs which needs further investigation 4 conclusions in this work a physiological stress mediated response mazef mediated pcd has been found to be vital for the antibacterial and antibiofouling behaviors of qac modified membranes upon contact with qac active layer that triggered mazef the affected cells can regulate population in which bacterial cells communicate with each other through a quorum sensing autoinducer edf leading to the inhibition of biofilm growth on the contrary when mazef is knocked out the mazef mediated pcd is excluded from the system and the bacterial population is less challenged by the stressful condition induced by qac modified membrane further investigation of mazef mediated pcd systems upon cooperation of mixed bacteria culture e g mbrs and relevant influencing factors e g sludge concentration is required in order to extend the application of antibiofouling membranes the proposed mechanism can provide a new

15304,in this study a novel and efficient heterogeneous electro fenton ef process with a potassium ferrate k2feo4 modified carbon felt fe cf cathode was developed for chloramphenicol cap removal the catalytic activity was assessed by the comparison of different systems and the effects of multiple operating parameters k2feo4 dosage initial solution ph applied current and co existing constituents results indicated that the fe cf cathode exhibited excellent performance for cap degradation almost 100 removal efficiency within 60 min over a wide range of ph ph 3 9 during heterogeneous ef ascribed to the synergistic effect of embedded iron species and porous graphitic carbon structure and effective utilization of the in situ generated h2o2 moreover the fe cf cathode possessed good recyclability with low metal leaching 98 2 cap removal efficiency after reused for 5 times and outstanding real water application performance the oh and o2 were responsible for cap degradation while oh played a main role moreover the toxicity evaluation by e coli growth experiments demonstrated an efficient toxicity reduction in this system overall a novel heterogeneous ef functional cathode with superior performance was fabricated via a green low cost one step method which shows promising application potential for actual wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords heterogeneous electro fenton chloramphenicol water treatment potassium ferrate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chloramphenicol cap a widely used chlorinated nitroaromatic antibiotic is commonly used in clinical practice aquaculture and poultry farming due to its effective broad spectrum antibacterial properties and low cost cotillas et al 2018 sarmah et al 2006 however the excessive use of chloramphenicol has also caused a series of water pollution and ecological risk guo et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 the existence of chloramphenicol in the environment may cause serious toxic effects towards humans such as aplastic anemia and genotoxic carcinogenicity zhang et al 2020 currently it is difficult for traditional sewage plants to completely remove this pollutant therefore it is of great importance to develop novel and efficient technologies to tackle this problem to date various techniques have been proposed for chloramphenicol removal including advanced oxidation processes dong et al 2017 microbial treatment zhang et al 2020 membrane separation kou et al 2012 photolysis amildon et al 2018 adsorption liao et al 2013 etc remarkably electro fenton ef an efficient ease of operation and eco friendly technique has gained significant attention since it could avoid the transportation storage and operation risks of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 occurred during traditional fenton process cao et al 2020 martínez huitle et al 2015 yang et al 2022 ye et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 in ef process h2o2 can be formed in situ continuously via 2e oxygen reduction reaction orr at a suitable cathode eq 1 and can further react with ferrous ions fe2 to generate hydroxyl radicals oh eq 2 with strong oxidation ability to degrade various recalcitrant organic pollutants the other interesting characteristic of ef is that the regeneration of fe2 can be achieved by e reduction of fe3 at the cathode eq 3 which could greatly improve the formation of oh the ef process could be divided into homogeneous and heterogeneous ef reactions compared to homogeneous ef heterogeneous ef using iron containing solid catalysts or modified electrodes has been considered to be more appropriate for real wastewater treatment overcoming the disadvantages of non reusability narrow working ph range and iron sludge production during homogeneous ef process hu et al 2022 ye et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 1 o2 2e 2h h2o2 2 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 3 fe3 e fe2 the generation and catalytic efficiency of h2o2 in the heterogeneous ef process depend primarily on the cathode material and catalyst ganiyu et al 2017 in recent years extensive studies have been conducted to prepare the heterogeneous ef functional cathode by immobilizing the catalyst on the cathode luo et al 2020 salmeron et al 2021 yu et al 2021 importantly the functional cathode can not only generate sufficient h2o2 through 2e orr but also provide efficient fenton catalysts for h2o2 activation carbon felt cf has been considered as attractive ef cathode materials for the removal of organic pollutants owing to advantages of non toxicity low cost and high selectivity for 2e orr which is conducive to the formation of h2o2 ye et al 2019 however given that cf possesses hydrophobicity low electrochemical activity weak redox reaction kinetics and poor degradation efficiency of organic contaminants it is necessary to modify the cf cathode jin et al 2022 le et al 2016 2017 lu et al 2022 pan et al 2018 sklari et al 2015 several modification techniques have been utilized for the improvement of electrochemical activity of cf for example pan et al used gaseous acetic acid to activate cf under n2 atmosphere at high temperature of 1100 c to provide large area and high content of defects and oxygen containing functional groups which achieved enhanced ef performance pan et al 2018 sklari et al prepared fe cf electrodes via oxidative or reduced oxidative conditions which showed improved stability and a removal efficiency of 63 7 for diclofenac sklari et al 2015 nevertheless these two researches suffer from either high cost associated with very high activation temperature or relatively low pollutant removal efficiency the development of a cost effective convenient and eco friendly alternative modification process for cf remains a desirable direction potassium ferrate k2feo4 a potent green disinfectant with much greater oxidation power than iron and ferrous compounds could be used as an internal oxidation modifier in addition to acting as the precursor of magnetic iron oxides the iron doped porous graphitic biochar synthesized with k2feo4 as the activator has been demonstrated to show good catalytic activity towards persulfate activation for the degradation of 17β estradiol zhang et al 2019 another research also reported that the iron modified carbonized soil synthesized from petroleum contaminated soil with k2feo4 pretreatment was an effective persulfate activator for degradation of aniline li et al 2022 nevertheless it s worth noting that in these research the ferrate modified carbon material was used directly as a heterogeneous catalyst for organic pollutant degradation and it suffered from structure collapse and poor cycling performance due to the continuous oxidation of fe0 or feii to feiii in spite of this k2feo4 might be a potential candidate to prepare high performance functional cf cathode for the heterogeneous ef process without need of additional modifiers as h2o2 can be generated in situ and fe0 or feii can be regenerated through cathodic feiii reduction however up to now there were no studies conducted and reported to validate this hypothesis consequently herein we innovatively proposed a one step pyrolysis of raw cf and k2feo4 where k2feo4 was utilized as both catalyst precursor fe and activating agent koh to modify the cf into functional fe cf material to serve as heterogeneous ef cathode for cap removal the content of this study includes 1 comparing the cap removal performance by anodic oxidation fenton like process homogeneous ef process and heterogeneous ef process 2 exploring the effects of operating parameters such as k2feo4 dosage initial solution ph and applied current 3 investigating the effects of co existing constituents e g inorganic anions and natural organic matter 4 evaluating the reusability of recycled fe cf and the practicability of fe cf ef system in actual water matrix 5 elucidating the mechanisms of cap removal in fe cf ef system 6 proposing possible cap degradation pathways and assessing the toxicity of degradation products 2 experimental section 2 1 materials and reagents carbon felt cf was obtained from beihai carbon material co ltd which needed to be firstly cut to specific dimensions 3 0 cm 2 0 cm potassium ferrate k2feo4 and chloramphenicol c11h12cl2n2o5 98 was obtained from shanghai yien chemical technology co ltd and shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd respectively acetone c3h6o 99 5 ethanol c2h6o 99 7 sodium sulfate na2so4 99 2 3 dihydroxybenzoic acid 2 3 dhba salicylic acid sa 2 5 dihydroxybenzoic acid 2 5 dhba tert butanol tba 99 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxy tempo 99 hydrochloric acid hcl 37 sodium hydroxide naoh 96 were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd ultrapure water millipore was used to prepare the test solutions except for actual water matrix 2 2 electrode preparation the k2feo4 modified carbon felt fe cf cathode was prepared based on a one step strategy firstly the commercial carbon felt was immersed in acetone and ultrasonically oscillated for 30 min then it was put in anhydrous ethanol and ultrasonically oscillated for 30 min which was followed by a washing step with ultrapure water and a drying step in a 60 c oven the cleaned carbon felt was stirred in 0 1 m k2feo4 aqueous solution for 8 h and then dried in the oven at 80 c overnight the obtained carbon felt was then placed in the tube furnace where it was heated to 700 c and kept for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 c min with the protection of n2 the pyrolyzed carbon felt was further washed several times with 1 m hcl and ultrapure water to obtain the final product which was named as fe cf additionally for comparison the carbon felt with k2feo4 treatment was also pyrolyzed at other temperatures 600 800 c with the other synthesis conditions identical to that of 700 c which was named as fe cf x x 600 800 2 3 characterization methods scanning electron microscope sem was used to characterize the morphology characteristics of the raw cf and fe cf where the element mapping was also conducted to reveal the distribution of different elements the crystal structure of the fresh cf and fe cf was measured by x ray diffraction xrd in the region of 15 70 cm 1 the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific k alpha was utilized to analyze the element contents and chemical states of fresh cf and fe cf 2 4 experimental procedure degradation experiments were performed in a 200 ml reactor equipped with a pt anode 3 0 cm 1 0 cm in parallel to the fe cf cathode 3 0 cm 2 0 cm at a distance of 2 cm 150 ml 20 mg l cap solution containing 50 mm na2so4 as the electrolyte was used while the cathode surface was continuously aerated with air at a rate of 0 1 l min 1 m h2so4 and 1 m naoh were used for adjusting the initial solution ph prior to the heterogeneous ef reaction continuous stirring without applied current was conducted for 30 min to ensure the adsorption saturation samples were taken at pre determined time intervals and filtered through 0 45 μm membrane for subsequent analysis all the tests were carried out in triplicate and the mean values and corresponding standard deviations were reported 2 5 analytical methods the concentration of cap was detected by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1200 series usa at 30 c at 278 nm where the mobile phase was methanol and water 60 40 v v and the retention time was 2 34 min with a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the iron concentration leached in the solution after reaction was determined by the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7009 series usa the concentration of h2o2 was measured by the method of potassium titanium oxalate the concentration of hydroxyl radical oh was determined via oxidation of sa 2 3 dhba and 2 5 dhba as the reaction products between oh and sa were measured by the high performance liquid chromatography hplc to determine the mineralization efficiency of pollutants after degradation the change of total organic carbon toc before and after reaction was measured by shimadzu toc vcph the degradation intermediates were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry hplc ms 2 6 toxicity assay changes in toxicity are crucial in the degradation process of pollutants the degradation process should aim to produce low or even nontoxic products in this study traditional bacterial growth was used to evaluate the toxicity of degradation products during the reaction process specifically escherichia coli e coli a common gram negative strain was selected as the experimental bacterium the bacterial mother solution 2 0 107 cfu ml was diluted to 102 103 magnitude step by step then the diluted bacteria were mixed with the cap solution of given time intervals during the degradation process the mixed bacteria solution was inoculated on the eosin methylene blue medium and incubated at a constant temperature biochemical incubator 37 c for 24 h after 24 h cultivation the survival rate of e coli in different points in time could be assessed by counting the bacteria number which could further evaluate the changes in toxicity in the degradation reaction system 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the fe cf the sem images of fresh cf and fe cf700 were presented in fig 1 it could be obviously observed that the raw cf displayed a rod like morphology with a clean and smooth surface fig 1a after modified with k2feo4 the surface of fe cf became rough and porous while retaining the raw cf structure well which greatly promoted electron transfer and mass diffusion in the catalytic process fig 1b d furthermore some solid particles were clearly observed on the fe cf suggesting that the iron species were loaded onto the fe cf surface element mapping of sem eds was presented in fig 1e g which further indicated that the elements c o and fe were uniformly dispersed on the fe cf figure s1 showed the xrd pattern of fresh cf as well as the xrd patterns of fresh and used fe cf700 as for fresh cf there was a broad peak at 25 4 which was attributed to amorphous carbon structure of cf the synthesized fresh fe cf700 displayed a variety of diffraction peaks at 2θ 24 4 31 4 39 4 and 60 9 jcpds no 33 0664 2θ 30 1 34 3 jcpds no 72 2302 and 40 8 and 2θ 44 8 jcpds no 06 0696 which could be assigned to fe2o3 fe3o4 and metallic fe respectively revealing that the iron was embedded in cf regarding the contribution of different iron phases in the cap degradation process the metallic fe on the modified carbon felt could play a role in the generation of h2o2 via the reaction of fe0 o2 2h fe2 h2o2 the fe2 produced from fe0 oxidation and the fe2 in the fe3o4 could assist in the generation of oh via fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh the fe3 produced from fe0 or fe2 oxidation and the fe3 in the fe2o3 could obtain electrons from the cathode to transform into fe2 via fe3 e fe2 and the generated fe2 could further assist in the generation of oh as shown in fig 2 a the appearance of c o and fe was also confirmed by xps full spectra of fe cf700 in fig 2b the c 1 s peaks at 284 30 ev and 286 21 ev belonged to cc and co respectively akhavan et al 2013 the o 1 s spectrum fig 2c was deconvoluted into co 532 81 ev and fe o 530 90 ev with 5 35 of o in the o 1 s spectra binding with fe owing to the formation of fe2o3 and fe3o4 fig 2d exhibited the fe 2p spectra with the characteristic peaks around 711 20 ev and 724 30 ev belonging to the fe ii 53 49 wen et al 2021 the peaks at 713 16 ev and 726 90 ev attributed to the fe iii 28 31 and the peak at 719 20 ev assigned to metallic fe 18 20 zhang et al 2019 2022 which indicated that a large proportion of iron combined with the cf in the form of oxides 3 2 removal of cap by different systems according to figure s2 fe cf synthesized at 700 c pyrolysis temperature obtained a better cap removal efficiency nearly 100 than fe cf synthesized at 600 c and 800 c pyrolysis temperature to find the reason why fe cf700 obtained a better cap removal efficiency than fe cf600 and fe cf800 we conducted bet analysis and investigated the accumulation of oh in the solution in the absence of cap with fe cf synthesized at different calcination temperatures as the cathode bet results indicated that the fe cf synthesized at 700 c possessed the largest specific surface area and pore volume table s1 which implies the largest number of active sites enabling cap adsorption and h2o2 generation that were beneficial to the subsequent catalytic degradation of cap moreover figure s3 indicated that the fe cf700 cathode produced the largest quantity of oh which further explained why fe cf synthesized at 700 c obtained a better cap removal efficiency than fe cf synthesized at 600 c and 800 c in the following experiments cf fe700 was chosen as the optimal cathode material based on the consideration of cap removal efficiency and energy consumption firstly we compared the cap degradation performance between the fe cf700 ef system and the direct use of potassium ferrate and the results were summarized in table s2 from which it can be known that the cap degradation performance by direct use of potassium ferrate was much lower than that by the fe cf700 ef system additionally two problems would arise from the direct use of potassium ferrate as oxidant to degrade cap 1 secondary pollution would occur to the treated water because the color of potassium ferrate solution is aubergine and hence further post treatment is required 2 it is difficult to separate the potassium ferrate from the treated water for multiple recycling moreover other different systems were used to evaluate the electrocatalytic performance of the acquired fe cf700 via the cap removal efficiency and apparent reaction rate constant of cap as shown in fig 3 the cap removal efficiency by anodic oxidation pt as the anode fresh cf as the cathode fenton like process fe cf700 without current with addition of 237 μm h2o2 homogeneous ef process fresh cf as the cathode with 0 2 mm fe2 added were tested for comparison the reason why 0 2 mm fe2 was used in the homogeneous ef process was based on the electro generated amount of h2o2 when using carbon felt as the cathode from fig 4 d we can know that the concentration of electro generated h2o2 at 60 min under applied current of 50 ma was 0 19 mm i e around 0 2 mm meanwhile according to the reaction fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh it can be known that in the homogeneous ef process the molar concentration of fe2 and h2o2 should be equal in order to achieve optimal performance therefore 0 2 mm fe2 was added in the homogeneous ef process from fig 3a it was observed that the cap adsorption was negligible or slight and equilibrium could be achieved within 30 min which was a fast process in each situation the cap removal efficiency by anodic oxidation was 34 8 primarily via oh generated at the anodic surface as presented in eq 4 and only 14 3 cap removal efficiency was achieved for fenton like process and 59 8 for homogeneous ef process by contrast the heterogeneous ef process with the participation of fe cf700 exhibited greatly enhanced cap removal efficiency 99 5 within 60 min this could be explained by the continuous generation of sufficient h2o2 and rapid reduction of fe iii at the fe cf cathode thereby forming sufficient fe ii catalytic sites to produce active radicals 4 m h2o m oh e h according to pseudo first order reaction kinetics equation ln c0 ct kt c0 the initial cap concentration and ct the cap concentration at a certain reaction time the reaction rate constant k is calculated to further provide insight into quantitative description of cap degradation from fig 3b it can be known that the k value of the heterogeneous ef process for cap degradation 0 085 min 1 was higher than those of homogeneous ef process 0 015 min 1 fenton like process 0 001 min 1 and anodic oxidation 0 006 min 1 which further demonstrated the superiority of heterogeneous ef process in cap degradation using the fe cf700 cathode table s3 also summarizes the performance comparison between the fe cf700 ef system and other ef catalysts towards cap degradation from which it can be concluded that the catalytic performance of fe cf700 cathode in this study shows advantages over ef catalysts that have been previously developed 3 3 effects of operating parameters on cap removal fig 4a presented the effects of k2feo4 dosages during the modification of fresh cf on heterogeneous ef degradation of cap using the fe cf700 cathode with the increase of k2feo4 dosage from 0 05 m to 0 1 m the removal efficiency of cap after 60 min degradation process was significantly improved which might be the result of the increase of active sites e g fe0 fe ii promoting the oh generation in heterogeneous ef process nevertheless when k2feo4 dosage further increased to 0 125 m the cap removal efficiency decreased which might be because the excessive catalysts would not promote the production of oh when the other operating conditions kept unchanged and the amount of electro generated h2o2 remained the same and the excessive fe ii on the carbon felt consumed oh eq 5 during the heterogeneous ef process therefore unless otherwise stated 0 1 m k2feo4 was considered as the optimum concentration for cf modification and applied for subsequent experiments 5 fe2 oh fe3 oh as is well known the catalytic activity on contaminant degradation during electro fenton process is greatly affected by the initial ph of solution the activity on cap degradation of the fe cf700 has been conducted over the ph range of 3 9 and the results have been presented in fig 4b the cap was almost completely removed within 60 min at all ph operating windows ph 3 0 4 0 5 8 unadjusted 7 0 9 0 and as the ph increased the k value of cap degradation decreased slightly because the deficiency of h at the cathode under neutral and alkaline conditions led to decreased h2o2 production as indicated in eq 1 thereby affecting the removal of cap oturan et al 2011 we also measured the metal iron leaching from fe cf cathode under different initial solution ph during the heterogeneous ef process and the results were displayed in fig s4 from which it can be observed that the concentrations of leached fe were all relatively low these results demonstrated that the degradation performance of cap using fe cf700 cathode could remain stable over a wide ph range in heterogeneous ef process moreover to avoid the cost of ph adjustment ph 5 8 without adjustment was selected in this study applied current also plays an important role for heterogeneous ef process as it is the driving force for the reduction of dissolved oxygen at the cathode to produce h2o2 fig 4c and fig s5 showed that the degradation efficiency of cap varied with applied current with an increased applied current leading to a higher degradation efficiency of cap specifically the cap removal efficiency was enhanced from 20 14 to 82 42 and to 99 50 when the applied current increased from 10 ma to 30 ma and to 50 ma which was probably due to the fact that higher applied current would increase the production of h2o2 see fig 4d and accelerate the regeneration of fe2 thereby increasing the generation of oh and promoting the degradation of cap during the heterogeneous ef process du et al 2020 however when the applied current further increased from 50 ma to 80 ma the cap removal efficiency increased slightly reaching 99 75 which might be as a result of the limited catalytic ability towards h2o2 by fe cf700 based on the above results a current of 50 ma was chosen in our heterogeneous ef process 3 4 effect of co existing constituents on cap degradation there are various inorganic anions e g cl hco3 h2po4 and no3 and organic matters e g humic acid ha in actual wastewater which may not only affect the in situ generation of h2o2 but also affect the oxidative degradation of cap by the heterogeneous ef process the effects of dissolved inorganic anions on cap degradation by the fe cf700 ef system were displayed in fig 5 a it was observed that the presence of 10 mm cl exhibited adverse effect on cap degradation compared with the control in the fe cf700 ef process within 60 min treatment the cl could be oxidized by oh to produce chlorine species that are less reactive than oh radicals which could also participate in cap oxidation degradation eqs 6 8 nie et al 2015 as for the hco3 the reaction rate constant of cap degradation decreased from 0 085 of the control to 0 029 min 1 with 10 mm hco3 addition which could be attributed to that hco3 as a quencher of oh induced the production of lower effective co3 eq 9 and the surface properties of fe cf had been possibly changed due to hco3 acting as a buffer weakening its catalytic ability and reducing the generation of radicals yang et al 2017 particularly the introduction of 10 mm h2po4 slightly inhibited cap degradation mostly due to the slow reaction rate between h2po4 and oh eq 10 and the formation of weak oxidant h2po4 could not effectively oxidize cap maruthamuthu et al 1978 in addition the presence of 10 mm no3 also resulted in a significant declined cap degradation efficiency 86 2 after 60 min treatment because of the subsequent formation of the lower activity radicals no3 eq 11 zhou et al 2016 6 cl ho clho k 4 3 0 4 109 m 1 s 1 7 clho h cl h2o k 2 1 0 7 1010 m 1 s 1 8 cl cl cl2 k 2 1 1019 m 1 s 1 9 hco3 ho co3 oh k 8 6 108 m 1 s 1 10 h2po4 ho h2po4 oh k 1 2 104 m 1 s 1 11 no3 ho no3 oh k 5 5 105 m 1 s 1 the influence of ha on the degradation of cap by the fe cf700 ef system was depicted in fig 5b it was observed that adding ha had an inhibitory effect on cap removal and the rate constant decreased from 0 085 to 0 059 min 1 in the background of 10 mm of ha the depletion of fe cf700 catalytic activity could be explained from two key aspects i ha could compete with cap for the electrophilic oh due to its electron rich sites ii the interaction between h2o2 and the catalytic sites was hindered due to the attachment of ha to heterogeneous fe cf700 surface li et al 2018 3 5 recyclability and practicability of fe cf reusability of the fe cf catalyst is a key factor for evaluating its potential for efficient and economical application in practical water treatment here fe cf700 cathode was carried out for five cyclic tests in succession for cap degradation under the same conditions with the results displayed in fig 6 as can be seen after five cycles the cap degradation efficiency decreased by only 1 3 and the degradation rate constant only decreased slightly from 0 085 in the first run to 0 067 in the fifth run we also monitored the concentration of iron leaching in each of the cycles from fig s6 it can be known that the leaching amount of fe in each cycle was less than 0 13 mg l which was lower than previous reports cao et al 2020 hu et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 these results indicate that the fe cf700 cathode has good recyclability and stability for cap degradation in the heterogeneous electro fenton system in addition the xps spectra of c 1 s o 1 s and fe 2p of the fe cf700 cathode before and after reaction fig 2 as well as the xrd patterns of the fe cf700 cathode before and after reaction fig s1 showed similar profiles which further demonstrated the recyclability and stability of the fe cf700 cathode from fig 2d and fig s1 it can be also known that a certain amount of fe0 and fe ii transformed into fe iii during the cycling tests but the conversion quantity was insignificant moreover considering that the relevant raw materials for the preparation of fe cf700 cathode are widely available and inexpensive it can be regarded as a promising material practicability is another key factor for evaluating the application potential to further investigate the practical application performance of the fe cf700 ef system some actual water samples were selected which were ultrapure water uw tap water tw river water rw lake water lw and medical wastewater mw the tap water river water and lake water did not contain cap themselves therefore the actual water matrixes tap water river water lake water containing 20 mg l cap were prepared by dissolving appropriate amount of cap in the collected actual water the collected medical wastewater contained 15 mg l cap in itself the sampling locations and the real water parameters were described in fig 7 a and table s4 respectively and the degradation efficiency and kinetics of cap in these water matrixes were displayed in fig 7b and c ultrapure water was used as the control sample after 60 min of heterogeneous ef reaction the degradation efficiencies of cap reached 94 74 97 31 and 94 52 and the corresponding reaction rate constants were 0 050 0 059 and 0 047 in tap water river water and lake water respectively which were all lower than that in ultrapure water 99 5 0 085 in particular the efficiency of removing cap from medical wastewater was the lowest which was only 80 02 and the corresponding reaction rate constant was only 0 027 the lower degradation efficiency and kinetics of cap in tap water river water lake water and medical wastewater may be caused by the presence of inorganic ions and organic substances that could consume active radicals as discussed in the previous section as medical wastewater contained a much greater level of organic substances than the other actual water matrixes as indicated by the high value of toc it is reasonable that the degradation efficiency of cap was the lowest in the medical wastewater in spite of the degradation difference overall the fe cf700 ef system had good cap removal efficiency in actual water 3 6 reaction mechanisms 3 6 1 identification of reactive oxygen species free radical species play a key role in the electro fenton degradation of organic contaminants generally h2o2 could generate two reactive oxygen species including oh and o2 cheng et al 2020 the main reactive oxygen species in the degradation of cap by fe cf700 ef system were studied by epr analysis with 5 5 dimethylpyrroline n oxide dmpo as the spin trapping agent from fig 8 c it can be seen that no signals were detected in the absence of catalyst and obvious 4 fold characteristic signals with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 assigned to the dmpo oh were detected under the electrolysis condition with fe cf700 cathode fig 8a which indicated that oh was generated in cap degradation during the heterogeneous ef process jiang et al 2018 o2 was tested in methanol due to its instability in water and its tendency to disproportionate rather than react with dmpo the epr spectrum confirmed the generation of o2 from dmpo ooh adducts fig 8b spulber et al 2015 the quenching experiments were carried out in the presence of a scavenger tert butanol tba for oh and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxy tempo for o2 respectively which further clarified the contribution of oh and o2 in the process of cap degradation the negative effects of tba and tempo on cap degradation were shown in fig s7 which indicated that oh was a dominant radical and the contribution of o2 to the cap removal was smaller in the fe cf700 ef process which was consistent with the previous reports hammouda et al 2016 3 6 2 possible degradation mechanism of cap in view of the aforementioned results and discussion a possible cap removal mechanism in our heterogeneous ef process with fe cf700 cathode was proposed fig 9 in the initial stage a small fraction of cap molecules in the solution were adsorbed on the fe cf700 surface due to electrostatic attraction or functional group interaction importantly three generating routes of oh were displayed i anodic oxidation process heterogeneous hydroxyl radicals m oh could be generated at the anodic surface via eq 4 which could only attack the cap around the anode ii surface catalysis process the in situ generated h2o2 was excited to produce oh and feiii through the surface catalysis due to the presence of feii on the fe cf700 cathode surface eq 12 and feii could be regenerated in situ through obtaining an electron cui et al 2021 or the reaction between feiii and h2o2 on the catalyst surface eqs 13 and 14 thereby forming a feii feiii cycle which was beneficial to the stabilization of the iron source and alleviation of the iron sludge problem iii homogeneous ef process due to the leaching of a small amount of iron in the solution homogeneous reaction could also occur in the fe cf700 heterogeneous ef system eqs 2 3 and 15 ultimately the resulting oh and ho2 reacted with cap to form intermediates until complete mineralization to sum up the catalytic reaction mechanisms in our heterogeneous ef process included slight adsorption anodic oxidation surface catalyzed process and homogeneous ef reaction 12 feii h2o2 feiii oh oh 13 feiii e feii 14 feiii h2o2 feii h ho2 15 fe3 h2o2 fe2 h ho2 3 7 degradation pathways and toxicity assessment in addition to understanding the cap degradation efficiency and corresponding rate constants of the fe cf700 heterogeneous ef system it is also important to evaluate the mineralization ability of cap by this system as observed from fig s8 approximately 56 5 of toc for cap could be removed within 60 min of the ef reaction and the mineralization efficiency of cap was improved with the prolongation of the reaction time nevertheless the toc removal efficiency was lower than the cap removal efficiency which indicated the presence of degradation intermediates thus the cap degradation intermediates were analyzed by hplc ms techniques according to the lc ms spectra results ten intermediates were identified table s5 and four possible degradation pathways for cap were proposed fig 10 he et al 2022 x hu et al 2022 yu et al 2019 for cap molecule the cn bond attached to the benzene ring and the ccl bond with weaker dissociation energy are easier to break than other chemical bonds in pathway i cap organic fragment m z 321 was successively converted into p1 m z 307 p2 m z 293 and p3 m z 289 by deoxidation and dehydration for pathway ii the oh radicals attacked cap to induce dechlorination and the fracture of the amide group to yield p4 m z 237 and p5 m z 136 which would be further oxidized to small molecules regarding pathway iii the ccl bond of cap was directly dechlorinated leading to the formation of the compounds of p6 m z 287 next p7 m z 211 was further produced via c2 n bond cleavage due to the attack of n position by oh in pathway iv p8 m z 195 was formed through dihydroxylation reaction and the fracture of c2 n bond because of the attack of c2 position by oh p8 could be further oxidized to p9 m z 151 subsequently p10 m z 169 was generated from p9 under the continuing attack of oh finally part of these intermediates were further transformed into co2 h2o and inorganic ions under the attack of reactive radicals notably toxic intermediates might be formed due to incomplete mineralization of refractory organic pollutants to further study the toxic variability of the fe cf700 heterogeneous ef system the toxicity of the solution during the reaction was assessed using the relative inhibition rate of gram negative strain e coli and the results were presented in fig 11 in the first 20 min the relative inhibition rate of e coli increased from 20 8 to 46 0 indicating that the toxicity of the reaction intermediates was greater than that of cap as the reaction time proceeded the relative inhibition rate gradually decreased to 4 7 which suggested that the toxicity of reaction solution was lower than that of the original solution further indicating that the method was feasible and the fe cf700 ef system largely eliminated the toxicity of cap and its degradation intermediates 4 conclusions in summary we have prepared a novel and efficient fe cf material as the heterogeneous ef functional cathode via a green low cost one step method characterizations analysis indicated that iron species were successfully embedded in cf and the fe cf possessed a porous graphitic carbon structure experiment results demonstrated that the fe cf700 ef system exhibited outstanding catalytic degradation performance for cap removal over a wide ph range under conditions of k2feo4 dosage 0 1 m initial ph 5 8 unadjusted and applied current 50 ma the cap removal efficiency and the rate constant reached 99 5 and 0 085 respectively within 60 min the presence of inorganic anions cl hco3 and no3 and humic acid had negative effects on cap degradation to different degree moreover fe cf700 exhibited excellent recyclability with low metal leaching and remarkable real water application potential through epr analysis and quenching experiments it was found that both oh and o2 were responsible for cap degradation while oh played a main role moreover the toxicity evaluation

15304,in this study a novel and efficient heterogeneous electro fenton ef process with a potassium ferrate k2feo4 modified carbon felt fe cf cathode was developed for chloramphenicol cap removal the catalytic activity was assessed by the comparison of different systems and the effects of multiple operating parameters k2feo4 dosage initial solution ph applied current and co existing constituents results indicated that the fe cf cathode exhibited excellent performance for cap degradation almost 100 removal efficiency within 60 min over a wide range of ph ph 3 9 during heterogeneous ef ascribed

performance was fabricated via a green low cost one step method which shows promising application potential for actual wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords heterogeneous electro fenton chloramphenicol water treatment potassium ferrate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chloramphenicol cap a widely used chlorinated nitroaromatic antibiotic is commonly used in clinical practice aquaculture and poultry farming due to its effective broad spectrum antibacterial properties and low cost cotillas et al 2018 sarmah et al 2006 however the excessive use of chloramphenicol has also caused a series of water pollution and ecological risk guo et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 the existence of chloramphenicol in the environment may cause serious toxic effects towards humans such as aplastic anemia and genotoxic carcinogenicity zhang et al 2020 currently it is difficult for traditional sewage plants to completely remove this pollutant therefore it is of great importance to develop novel and efficient technologies to tackle this problem to date various techniques have been proposed for chloramphenicol removal including advanced oxidation processes dong et al 2017 microbial treatment zhang et al 2020 membrane separation kou et al 2012 photolysis amildon et al 2018 adsorption liao et al 2013 etc remarkably electro fenton ef an efficient ease of operation and eco friendly technique has gained significant attention since it could avoid the transportation storage and operation risks of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 occurred during traditional fenton process cao et al 2020 martínez huitle et al 2015 yang et al 2022 ye et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 in ef process h2o2 can be formed in situ continuously via 2e oxygen reduction reaction orr at a suitable cathode eq 1 and can further react with ferrous ions fe2 to generate hydroxyl radicals oh eq 2 with strong oxidation ability to degrade various recalcitrant organic pollutants the other interesting characteristic of ef is that the regeneration of fe2 can be achieved by e reduction of fe3 at the cathode eq 3 which could greatly improve the formation of oh the ef process could be divided into homogeneous and heterogeneous ef reactions compared to homogeneous ef heterogeneous ef using iron containing solid catalysts or modified electrodes has been considered to be more appropriate for real wastewater treatment overcoming the disadvantages of non reusability narrow working ph range and iron sludge production during homogeneous ef process hu et al 2022 ye et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 1 o2 2e 2h h2o2 2 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh 3 fe3 e fe2 the generation and catalytic efficiency of h2o2 in the heterogeneous ef process depend primarily on the cathode material and catalyst ganiyu et al 2017 in recent years extensive studies have been conducted to prepare the heterogeneous ef functional cathode by immobilizing the catalyst on the cathode luo et al 2020 salmeron et al 2021 yu et al 2021 importantly the functional cathode can not only generate sufficient h2o2 through 2e orr but also provide efficient fenton catalysts for h2o2 activation carbon felt cf has been considered as attractive ef cathode materials for the removal of organic pollutants owing to advantages of non toxicity low cost and high selectivity for 2e orr which is conducive to the formation of h2o2 ye et al 2019 however given that cf possesses hydrophobicity low electrochemical activity weak redox reaction kinetics and poor degradation efficiency of organic contaminants it is necessary to modify the cf cathode jin et al 2022 le et al 2016 2017 lu et al 2022 pan et al 2018 sklari et al 2015 several modification techniques have been utilized for the improvement of electrochemical activity of cf for example pan et al used gaseous acetic acid to activate cf under n2 atmosphere at high temperature of 1100 c to provide large area and high content of defects and oxygen containing functional groups which achieved enhanced ef performance pan et al 2018 sklari et al prepared fe cf electrodes via oxidative or reduced oxidative conditions which showed improved stability and a removal efficiency of 63 7 for diclofenac sklari et al 2015 nevertheless these two researches suffer from either high cost associated with very high activation temperature or relatively low pollutant removal efficiency the development of a cost effective convenient and eco friendly alternative modification process for cf remains a desirable direction potassium ferrate k2feo4 a potent green disinfectant with much greater oxidation power than iron and ferrous compounds could be used as an internal oxidation modifier in addition to acting as the precursor of magnetic iron oxides the iron doped porous graphitic biochar synthesized with k2feo4 as the activator has been demonstrated to show good catalytic activity towards persulfate activation for the degradation of 17β estradiol zhang et al 2019 another research also reported that the iron modified carbonized soil synthesized from petroleum contaminated soil with k2feo4 pretreatment was an effective persulfate activator for degradation of aniline li et al 2022 nevertheless it s worth noting that in these research the ferrate modified carbon material was used directly as a heterogeneous catalyst for organic pollutant degradation and it suffered from structure collapse and poor cycling performance due to the continuous oxidation of fe0 or feii to feiii in spite of this k2feo4 might be a potential candidate to prepare high performance functional cf cathode for the heterogeneous ef process without need of additional modifiers as h2o2 can be generated in situ and fe0 or feii can be regenerated through cathodic feiii reduction however up to now there were no studies conducted and reported to validate this hypothesis consequently herein we innovatively proposed a one step pyrolysis of raw cf and k2feo4 where k2feo4 was utilized as both catalyst precursor fe and activating agent koh to modify the cf into functional fe cf material to serve as heterogeneous ef cathode for cap removal the content of this study includes 1 comparing the cap removal performance by anodic oxidation fenton like process homogeneous ef process and heterogeneous ef process 2 exploring the effects of operating parameters such as k2feo4 dosage initial solution ph and applied current 3 investigating the effects of co existing constituents e g inorganic anions and natural organic matter 4 evaluating the reusability of recycled fe cf and the practicability of fe cf ef system in actual water matrix 5 elucidating the mechanisms of cap removal in fe cf ef system 6 proposing possible cap degradation pathways and assessing the toxicity of degradation products 2 experimental section 2 1 materials and reagents carbon felt cf was obtained from beihai carbon material co ltd which needed to be firstly

tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxy tempo 99 hydrochloric acid hcl 37 sodium hydroxide naoh 96 were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd ultrapure water millipore was used to prepare the test solutions except for actual water matrix 2 2 electrode preparation the k2feo4 modified carbon felt fe cf cathode was prepared based on a one step strategy firstly the commercial carbon felt was immersed in acetone and ultrasonically oscillated for 30 min then it was put in anhydrous ethanol and ultrasonically oscillated for 30 min which was followed by a washing step with ultrapure water and a drying step in a 60 c oven the cleaned carbon felt was stirred in 0 1 m k2feo4 aqueous solution for 8 h and then dried in the oven at 80 c overnight the obtained carbon felt was then placed in the tube furnace where it was heated to 700 c and kept for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 c min with the protection of n2 the pyrolyzed carbon felt was further washed several times with 1 m hcl and ultrapure water to obtain the final product which was named as fe cf additionally for comparison the carbon felt with k2feo4 treatment was also pyrolyzed at other temperatures 600 800 c with the other synthesis conditions identical to that of 700 c which was named as fe cf x x 600 800 2 3 characterization methods scanning electron microscope sem was used to characterize the morphology characteristics of the raw cf and fe cf where the element mapping was also conducted to reveal the distribution of different elements the crystal structure of the fresh cf and fe cf was measured by x ray diffraction xrd in the region of 15 70 cm 1 the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific k alpha was utilized to analyze the element contents and chemical states of fresh cf and fe cf 2 4 experimental procedure degradation experiments were performed in a 200 ml reactor equipped with a pt anode 3 0 cm 1 0 cm in parallel to the fe cf cathode 3 0 cm 2 0 cm at a distance of 2 cm 150 ml 20 mg l cap solution containing 50 mm na2so4 as the electrolyte was used while the cathode surface was continuously aerated with air at a rate of 0 1 l min 1 m h2so4 and 1 m naoh were used for adjusting the initial solution ph prior to the heterogeneous ef reaction continuous stirring without applied current was conducted for 30 min to ensure the adsorption saturation samples were taken at pre determined time intervals and filtered through 0 45 μm membrane for subsequent analysis all the tests were carried out in triplicate and the mean values and corresponding standard deviations were reported 2 5 analytical methods the concentration of cap was detected by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1200 series usa at 30 c at 278 nm where the mobile phase was methanol and water 60 40 v v and the retention time was 2 34 min with a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the iron concentration leached in the solution after reaction was determined by the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7009 series usa the concentration of h2o2 was measured by the method of potassium titanium oxalate the concentration of hydroxyl radical oh was determined via oxidation of sa 2 3 dhba and 2 5 dhba as the reaction products between oh and sa were measured by the high performance liquid chromatography hplc to determine the mineralization efficiency of pollutants after degradation the change of total organic carbon toc before and after reaction was measured by shimadzu toc vcph the degradation intermediates were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry hplc ms 2 6 toxicity assay changes in toxicity are crucial in the degradation process of pollutants the degradation process should aim to produce low or even nontoxic products in this study traditional bacterial growth was used to evaluate the toxicity of degradation products during the reaction process specifically escherichia coli e coli a common gram negative strain was selected as the experimental bacterium the bacterial mother solution 2 0 107 cfu ml was diluted to 102 103 magnitude step by step then the diluted bacteria were mixed with the cap solution of given time intervals during the degradation process the mixed bacteria solution was inoculated on the eosin methylene blue medium and incubated at a constant temperature biochemical incubator 37 c for 24 h after 24 h cultivation the survival rate of e coli in different points in time could be assessed by counting the bacteria number which could further evaluate the changes in toxicity in the degradation reaction system 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the fe cf the sem images of fresh cf and fe cf700 were presented in fig 1 it could be obviously observed that the raw cf displayed a rod like morphology with a clean and smooth surface fig 1a after modified with k2feo4 the surface of fe cf became rough and porous while retaining the raw cf structure well which greatly promoted electron transfer and mass diffusion in the catalytic process fig 1b d furthermore some solid particles were clearly observed on the fe cf suggesting that the iron species were loaded onto the fe cf surface element mapping of sem eds was presented in fig 1e g which further indicated that the elements c o and fe were uniformly dispersed on the fe cf figure s1 showed the xrd pattern of fresh cf as well as the xrd patterns of fresh and used fe cf700 as for fresh cf there was a broad peak at 25 4 which was attributed to amorphous carbon structure of cf the synthesized fresh fe cf700 displayed a variety of diffraction peaks at 2θ 24 4 31 4 39 4 and 60 9 jcpds no 33 0664 2θ 30 1 34 3 jcpds no 72 2302 and 40 8 and 2θ 44 8 jcpds no 06 0696 which could be assigned to fe2o3 fe3o4 and metallic fe respectively revealing that the iron was embedded in cf regarding the contribution of different iron phases in the cap degradation process the metallic fe on the modified carbon felt could play a role in the generation of h2o2 via the reaction of fe0 o2 2h fe2 h2o2 the fe2 produced from fe0 oxidation and the fe2 in the fe3o4 could assist in the generation of oh via fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh the fe3 produced from fe0 or fe2 oxidation and the fe3 in the fe2o3 could obtain electrons from the cathode to transform into fe2 via fe3 e fe2 and the generated fe2 could further assist in the generation of oh as shown in fig 2 a the appearance of c o and fe was also confirmed by xps full spectra of fe cf700 in fig 2b the c 1 s peaks at 284 30 ev and 286 21 ev belonged to cc and co respectively akhavan et al 2013 the o 1 s spectrum fig 2c was deconvoluted into co 532 81 ev and fe o 530 90 ev with 5 35 of o in the o 1 s spectra binding with fe owing to the formation of fe2o3 and fe3o4 fig 2d exhibited the fe 2p spectra with the characteristic peaks around 711 20 ev and 724 30 ev belonging to the fe ii 53 49 wen et al 2021 the peaks at 713 16 ev and 726 90 ev attributed to the fe iii 28 31 and the peak at 719 20 ev assigned to metallic fe 18 20 zhang et al 2019 2022 which indicated that a large proportion of iron combined with the cf in the form of oxides 3 2 removal of cap by different systems according to figure s2 fe cf synthesized at 700 c pyrolysis temperature obtained a better cap removal efficiency nearly 100 than fe cf synthesized at 600 c and 800 c pyrolysis temperature to find the reason why fe cf700 obtained a better cap removal efficiency than fe cf600 and fe cf800 we conducted bet analysis and investigated the accumulation of oh in the solution in the absence of cap with fe cf synthesized at different calcination temperatures as the cathode bet results indicated that the fe cf synthesized at 700 c possessed the largest specific surface area and pore volume table s1 which implies the largest number of active sites enabling cap adsorption and h2o2 generation that were beneficial to the subsequent catalytic degradation of cap moreover figure s3 indicated that the fe cf700 cathode produced the largest quantity of oh which further explained why fe cf synthesized at 700 c obtained a better cap removal efficiency than fe cf synthesized at 600 c and 800 c in the following experiments cf fe700 was chosen as the optimal cathode material based on the consideration of cap removal efficiency and energy consumption firstly we compared the cap degradation performance between the fe cf700 ef system and the direct use of potassium ferrate and the results were summarized in table s2 from which it can be known that the cap degradation performance by direct use of potassium ferrate was much lower than that by the fe cf700 ef system additionally two problems would arise from the direct use of potassium ferrate as oxidant to degrade cap 1 secondary pollution would occur to the treated water because the color of potassium ferrate solution is aubergine and hence further post treatment is required 2 it is difficult to separate the potassium ferrate from the treated water for multiple recycling moreover other different systems were used to evaluate the electrocatalytic performance of the acquired fe cf700 via the cap removal efficiency and apparent reaction rate constant of cap as shown in fig 3 the cap removal efficiency by anodic oxidation pt as the anode fresh cf as the cathode fenton like process fe cf700 without current with addition of 237 μm h2o2 homogeneous ef process fresh cf as the cathode with 0 2 mm fe2 added were tested for comparison the reason why 0 2 mm fe2 was used in the homogeneous ef process was based on the electro generated amount of h2o2 when using carbon felt as the cathode from fig 4 d we can know that the concentration of electro generated h2o2 at 60 min under applied current of 50 ma was 0 19 mm i e around 0 2 mm meanwhile according to the reaction fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh it can be known that in the homogeneous ef process the molar concentration of fe2 and h2o2 should be equal in order to achieve optimal performance therefore 0 2 mm fe2 was added in the homogeneous ef process from fig 3a it was observed that the cap adsorption was negligible or slight and equilibrium could be achieved within 30 min which was a fast process in each situation the cap removal efficiency by anodic oxidation was 34 8 primarily via oh generated at the anodic surface as presented in eq 4 and only 14 3 cap removal efficiency was achieved for fenton like process and 59 8 for homogeneous ef process by contrast the heterogeneous ef process with the participation of fe cf700 exhibited greatly enhanced cap removal efficiency 99 5 within 60 min this could be explained by the continuous generation of sufficient h2o2 and rapid reduction of fe iii at the fe cf cathode thereby forming sufficient fe ii catalytic sites to produce active radicals 4 m h2o m oh e h according to pseudo first order reaction kinetics equation ln c0 ct kt c0 the initial cap concentration and ct the cap concentration at a certain reaction time the reaction rate constant k is calculated to further provide insight into quantitative description of cap degradation from fig 3b it can be known that the k value of the heterogeneous ef process for cap degradation 0 085 min 1 was higher than those of homogeneous ef process 0 015 min 1 fenton like process 0 001 min 1 and anodic oxidation 0 006 min 1 which further demonstrated the superiority of heterogeneous ef process in cap degradation using the fe cf700 cathode table s3 also summarizes the performance comparison between the fe cf700 ef system and other ef catalysts towards cap degradation from which it can be concluded that the catalytic performance of fe cf700 cathode in this study shows advantages over ef catalysts that have been previously developed 3 3 effects of operating parameters on cap removal fig 4a presented the effects of k2feo4 dosages during the modification of fresh cf on heterogeneous ef degradation of cap using the fe cf700 cathode with the increase of k2feo4 dosage from 0 05 m to 0 1 m the removal efficiency of cap after 60 min degradation process was significantly improved which might be the result of the increase of active sites e g fe0 fe ii promoting the oh generation in heterogeneous ef process nevertheless when k2feo4 dosage further increased to 0 125 m the cap removal efficiency decreased which might be because the excessive catalysts would not promote the production of oh when the other operating conditions kept unchanged and the amount of electro generated h2o2 remained the same and the excessive fe ii on the carbon felt consumed oh eq 5 during the heterogeneous ef process therefore unless otherwise stated 0 1 m k2feo4 was considered as the optimum concentration for cf modification and applied for subsequent experiments 5 fe2 oh fe3 oh as is well known the catalytic activity on contaminant degradation during electro fenton process is greatly affected by the initial ph of solution the activity on cap degradation of the fe cf700 has been conducted over the ph range of 3 9 and the results have been presented in fig 4b the cap was almost completely removed within 60 min at all ph operating windows ph 3 0 4 0 5 8 unadjusted 7 0 9 0 and as the ph increased the k value of cap degradation decreased slightly because the deficiency of h at the cathode under neutral and alkaline conditions led to decreased h2o2 production as indicated in eq 1 thereby affecting the removal of cap oturan et al 2011 we also measured the metal iron leaching from fe cf cathode under different initial solution ph during the heterogeneous ef process and the results were displayed in fig s4 from which it can be observed that the concentrations of leached fe were all relatively low these results demonstrated that the degradation performance of cap using fe cf700 cathode could remain stable over a wide ph range in heterogeneous ef process moreover to avoid the cost of ph adjustment ph 5 8 without adjustment was selected in this study applied current also plays an important role for heterogeneous ef process as it is the driving force for the reduction of dissolved oxygen at the cathode to produce h2o2 fig 4c and fig s5 showed that the degradation efficiency of cap varied with applied current with an increased applied current leading to a higher degradation efficiency of cap specifically the cap removal efficiency was enhanced from 20 14 to 82 42 and to 99 50 when the applied current increased from 10 ma to 30 ma and to 50 ma which was probably due to the fact that higher applied current would increase the production of h2o2 see fig 4d and accelerate the regeneration of fe2 thereby increasing the generation of oh and promoting the degradation of cap during the heterogeneous ef process du et al 2020 however when the applied current further increased from 50 ma to 80 ma the cap removal efficiency increased slightly reaching 99 75 which might be as a result of the limited catalytic ability towards h2o2 by fe cf700 based on the above results a current of 50 ma was chosen in our heterogeneous ef process 3 4 effect of co existing constituents on cap degradation there are various inorganic anions e g cl hco3 h2po4 and no3 and organic matters e g humic acid ha in actual wastewater which may not only affect the in situ generation of h2o2 but also affect the oxidative degradation of cap by the heterogeneous ef process the effects of dissolved inorganic anions on cap degradation by the fe cf700 ef system were displayed in fig 5 a it was observed that the presence of 10 mm cl exhibited adverse effect on cap degradation compared with the control in the fe cf700 ef process within 60 min treatment the cl could be oxidized by oh to produce chlorine species that are less reactive than oh radicals which could also participate in cap oxidation degradation eqs 6 8 nie et al 2015 as for the hco3 the reaction rate constant of cap degradation decreased from 0 085 of the control to 0 029 min 1 with 10 mm hco3 addition which could be attributed to that hco3 as a quencher of oh induced the production of lower effective co3 eq 9 and the surface properties of fe cf had been possibly changed due to hco3 acting as a buffer weakening its catalytic ability and reducing the generation of radicals yang et al 2017 particularly the introduction of 10 mm h2po4 slightly inhibited cap degradation mostly due to the slow reaction rate between h2po4 and oh eq 10 and the formation of weak oxidant h2po4 could not effectively oxidize cap maruthamuthu et al 1978 in addition the presence of 10 mm no3 also resulted in a significant declined cap degradation efficiency 86 2 after 60 min treatment because of the subsequent formation of the lower activity radicals no3 eq 11 zhou et al 2016 6 cl ho clho k 4 3 0 4 109 m 1 s 1 7 clho h cl h2o k 2 1 0 7 1010 m 1 s 1 8 cl cl cl2 k 2 1 1019 m 1 s 1 9 hco3 ho co3 oh k 8 6 108 m 1 s 1 10 h2po4 ho h2po4 oh k 1 2 104 m 1 s 1 11 no3 ho no3 oh k 5 5 105 m 1 s 1 the influence of ha on the degradation of cap by the fe cf700 ef system was depicted in fig 5b it was observed that adding ha had an inhibitory effect on cap removal and the rate constant decreased from 0 085 to 0 059 min 1 in the background of 10 mm of ha the depletion of fe cf700 catalytic activity could be explained from two key aspects i ha could compete with cap for the electrophilic oh due to its electron rich sites ii the interaction between h2o2 and the catalytic sites was hindered due to the attachment of ha to heterogeneous fe cf700 surface li et al 2018 3 5 recyclability and practicability of fe cf reusability of the fe cf catalyst is a key factor for evaluating its potential for efficient and economical application in practical water treatment here fe cf700 cathode was carried out for five cyclic tests in succession for cap degradation under the same conditions with the results displayed in fig 6 as can be seen after five cycles the cap degradation efficiency decreased by only 1 3 and the degradation rate constant only decreased slightly from 0 085 in the first run to 0 067 in the fifth run we also monitored the concentration of iron leaching in each of the cycles from fig s6 it can be known that the leaching amount of fe in each cycle was less than 0 13 mg l which was lower than previous reports cao et al 2020 hu et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 these results indicate that the fe cf700 cathode has good recyclability and stability for cap degradation in the heterogeneous electro fenton system in addition the xps spectra of c 1 s o 1 s and fe 2p of the fe cf700 cathode before and after reaction fig 2 as well as the xrd patterns of the fe cf700 cathode before and after reaction fig s1 showed similar profiles which further demonstrated the recyclability and stability of the fe cf700 cathode from fig 2d and fig s1 it can be also known that a certain amount of fe0 and fe ii transformed into fe iii during the cycling tests but the conversion quantity was insignificant moreover considering that the relevant raw materials for the preparation of fe cf700 cathode are widely available and inexpensive it can be regarded as a promising material practicability is another key factor for evaluating the application potential to further investigate the practical application performance of the fe cf700 ef system some actual water samples were selected which were ultrapure water uw tap water tw river water rw lake water lw and medical wastewater mw the tap water river water and lake water did not contain cap themselves therefore the actual water matrixes tap water river water lake water containing 20 mg l cap were prepared by dissolving appropriate amount of cap in the collected actual water the collected medical wastewater contained 15 mg l cap in itself the sampling locations and the real water parameters were described in fig 7 a and table s4 respectively and the degradation efficiency and kinetics of cap in these water matrixes were displayed in fig 7b and c ultrapure water was used as the control sample after 60 min of heterogeneous ef reaction the degradation efficiencies of cap reached 94 74 97 31 and 94 52 and the corresponding reaction rate constants were 0 050 0 059 and 0 047 in tap water river water and lake water respectively which were all lower than that in ultrapure water 99 5 0 085 in particular the efficiency of removing cap from medical wastewater was the lowest which was only 80 02 and the corresponding reaction rate constant was only 0 027 the lower degradation efficiency and kinetics of cap in tap water river water lake water and medical wastewater may be caused by the presence of inorganic ions and organic substances that could consume active radicals as discussed in the previous section as medical wastewater contained a much greater level of organic substances than the other actual water matrixes as indicated by the high value of toc it is reasonable that the degradation efficiency of cap was the lowest in the medical wastewater in spite of the degradation difference overall the fe cf700 ef system had good cap removal efficiency in actual water 3 6 reaction mechanisms 3 6 1 identification of reactive oxygen species free radical species play a key role in the electro fenton degradation of organic contaminants generally h2o2 could generate two reactive oxygen species including oh and o2 cheng et al 2020 the main reactive oxygen species in the degradation of cap by fe cf700 ef system were studied by epr analysis with 5 5 dimethylpyrroline n oxide dmpo as the spin trapping agent from fig 8 c it can be seen that no signals were detected in the absence of catalyst and obvious 4 fold characteristic signals with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 assigned to the dmpo oh were detected under the electrolysis condition with fe cf700 cathode fig 8a which indicated that oh was generated in cap degradation during the heterogeneous ef process jiang et al 2018 o2 was tested in methanol due to its instability in water and its tendency to disproportionate rather than react with dmpo the epr spectrum confirmed the generation of o2 from dmpo ooh adducts fig 8b spulber et al 2015 the quenching experiments were carried out in the presence of a scavenger tert butanol tba for oh and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxy tempo for o2 respectively which further clarified the contribution of oh and o2 in the process of cap degradation the negative effects of tba and tempo on cap degradation were shown in fig s7 which indicated that oh was a dominant radical and the contribution of o2 to the cap removal was smaller in the fe cf700 ef process which was consistent with the previous reports hammouda et al 2016 3 6 2 possible degradation mechanism of cap in view of the aforementioned results and discussion a possible cap removal mechanism in our heterogeneous ef process with fe cf700 cathode was proposed fig 9 in the initial stage a small fraction of cap molecules in the solution were adsorbed on the fe cf700 surface due to electrostatic attraction or functional group interaction importantly three generating routes of oh were displayed i anodic oxidation process heterogeneous hydroxyl radicals m oh could be generated at the anodic surface via eq 4 which could only attack the cap around the anode ii surface catalysis process the in situ generated h2o2 was excited to produce oh and feiii through the surface catalysis due to the presence of feii on the fe cf700 cathode surface eq 12 and feii could be regenerated in situ through obtaining an electron cui et al 2021 or the reaction between feiii and h2o2 on the catalyst surface eqs 13 and 14 thereby forming a feii feiii cycle which was beneficial to the stabilization of the iron source and alleviation of the iron sludge problem iii homogeneous ef process due to the leaching of a small amount of iron in the solution homogeneous reaction could also occur in the fe cf700 heterogeneous ef system eqs 2 3 and 15 ultimately the resulting oh and ho2 reacted with cap to form intermediates until complete mineralization to sum up the catalytic reaction mechanisms in our heterogeneous ef process included slight adsorption anodic oxidation surface catalyzed process and homogeneous ef reaction 12 feii h2o2 feiii oh oh 13 feiii e feii 14 feiii h2o2 feii h ho2 15 fe3 h2o2 fe2 h ho2 3 7 degradation pathways and toxicity assessment in addition to understanding the cap degradation efficiency and corresponding rate constants of the fe cf700 heterogeneous ef system it is also important to evaluate the mineralization ability of cap by this system as observed from fig s8 approximately 56 5 of toc for cap could be removed within 60 min of the ef reaction and the mineralization efficiency of cap was improved with the prolongation of the reaction time nevertheless the toc removal efficiency was lower than the cap removal efficiency which indicated the presence of degradation intermediates thus the cap degradation intermediates were analyzed by hplc ms techniques according to the lc ms spectra results ten intermediates were identified table s5 and four possible degradation pathways for cap were proposed fig 10 he et al 2022 x hu et al 2022 yu et al 2019 for cap molecule the cn bond attached to the benzene ring and the ccl bond with weaker dissociation energy are easier to break than other chemical bonds in pathway i cap organic fragment m z 321 was successively converted into p1 m z 307 p2 m z 293 and p3 m z 289 by deoxidation and dehydration for pathway ii the oh radicals attacked cap to induce dechlorination and the fracture of the amide group to yield p4 m z 237 and p5 m z 136 which would be further oxidized to small molecules regarding pathway iii the ccl bond of cap was directly dechlorinated leading to the formation of the compounds of p6 m z 287 next p7 m z 211 was further produced via c2 n bond cleavage due to the attack of n position by oh in pathway iv p8 m z 195 was formed through dihydroxylation reaction and the fracture of c2 n bond because of the attack of c2 position by oh p8 could be further oxidized to p9 m z 151 subsequently p10 m z 169 was generated from p9 under the continuing attack of oh finally part of these intermediates were further transformed into co2 h2o and inorganic ions under the attack of reactive radicals notably toxic intermediates might be formed due to incomplete mineralization of refractory organic pollutants to further study the toxic variability of the fe cf700 heterogeneous ef system the toxicity of the solution during the reaction was assessed using the relative inhibition rate of gram negative strain e coli and the results were presented in fig 11 in the first 20 min the relative inhibition rate of e coli increased from 20 8 to 46 0 indicating that the toxicity of the reaction intermediates was greater than that of cap as the reaction time proceeded the relative inhibition rate gradually decreased to 4 7 which suggested that the toxicity of reaction solution was lower than that of the original solution further indicating that the method was feasible and the fe cf700 ef system largely eliminated the toxicity of cap and its degradation intermediates 4 conclusions in summary we have prepared a novel and efficient fe cf material as the heterogeneous ef functional cathode via a green low cost one step method characterizations analysis indicated that iron species were successfully embedded in cf and the fe cf possessed a porous graphitic carbon structure experiment results demonstrated that the fe cf700 ef system exhibited outstanding catalytic degradation performance for cap removal over a wide ph range under conditions of k2feo4 dosage 0 1 m initial ph 5 8 unadjusted and applied current 50 ma the cap removal efficiency and the rate constant reached 99 5 and 0 085 respectively within 60 min the presence of inorganic anions cl hco3 and no3 and humic acid had negative effects on cap degradation to different degree moreover fe cf700 exhibited excellent recyclability with low metal leaching and remarkable real water application potential through epr analysis and quenching experiments it was found that both oh and o2 were responsible for cap degradation while oh played a main role moreover the toxicity evaluation
