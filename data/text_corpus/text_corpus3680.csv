18400,the co existence of multiple pollutants in wastewater such as nitrate and heavy metal is of high concern due to the potential environmental impact in this study a novel biomaterial ppy fe3o4 pva was synthesized as a multifunctional bacteria immobilized carrier to enhance simultaneous denitrification cd ii and mn ii removal efficiency in bioreactor environments the morphology and main components of the ppy fe3o4 pva material were characterized by sem and xrd using ppy fe3o4 pva as a carrier the maximum removal efficiencies for nitrate 0 207 mg l 1 h 1 mn ii 90 98 and cd ii 98 78 were increased by 27 05 30 27 and 16 48 respectively compared to in the absence of ppy fe3o4 pva regeneration experiments were performed demonstrating the excellent stability and reusability of the ppy fe3o4 pva material furthermore effects of key factors were investigated on the performance of the ppy fe3o4 pva bioreactor in simultaneous denitrification mn ii and cd ii removal experimental results indicate that the highest nitrate mn ii and cd ii removal efficiencies were obtained under the conditions of hrt of 10 h initial mn ii concentration of 40 mg l and initial cd ii concentration of 10 mg l gas chromatography analysis indicated that n2 was the mainly final gaseous product moreover the bioreactor community diversity was markedly influenced by the initial concentration of cd ii and pseudomonas sp h117 played a primary role in the process of simultaneous denitrification mn ii and cd ii removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords denitrification mn ii and cd ii removal ppy fe3o4 pva biomaterial biofilm reactor community diversity 1 introduction the co existence of multiple pollutants in natural water contaminated groundwater or wastewater such as nitrates and heavy metals is of high concern worldwide capua et al 2015 li et al 2016a nitrate is mainly introduced into water due to industrial activities and excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers as well as the discharge of domestic sewage zhang et al 2019c during natural environment changes or human activities nitrate can be reduced to nitrite exposure to both nitrate and nitrite can pose a threat to human health such as methemoglobinemia and carcinogenic diseases zou et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a the world health organization who has set a limit of 50 mg l nitrate concentration in drinking water li et al 2016b biological methods of nitrate removal have gained increasing research interest as they have been found to be an effective way to decrease nitrogen pollution in aquatic ecosystems without inducing secondary pollution zhou et al 2016 wang et al 2018a due to metallurgical industry activities chemical fertilizer application and sewage sludge treatment heavy metal pollution has become a serious threat to the environment and human health kang and so 2016 kerjaschki et al 2014 many toxic heavy metals are water soluble and not biodegradable therefore they are transported by water and accumulate in aquatic organisms colantonio and kim 2016 cadmium is one of the most toxic elements which contributes to the potential environmental risk huang et al 2016 which mainly harmful to the kidneys and liver of human body aoshima 2016 various conventional methods have been reported to remediate the heavy metal pollutant from contaminated water including ion exchange chemical oxidation chemical precipitation processes membrane filtration and electrochemical treatment lu et al 2015 wu et al 2019 carolin et al 2017 however these methods present some disadvantages such as high energy requirements incomplete removal excessive sludge production requirement of further treatment and so on kurniawan et al 2006 consequently it is necessary to find an efficient and low cost method to remove heavy metals from wastewater it has been reported that the growth of some microorganisms such as bacteria fungi and yeast leads to effectively biological removal of heavy metals from wastewater fernández et al 2018 jacob et al 2018 nielsen et al 2018 biosorption processes by biosorbents have proven to have great potential for the removal of heavy metals from industrial wastewater vendruscolo et al 2017 for complex polluted water such as nitrate and heavy metal contaminated water biological methods combined denitrification and heavy metals removal is a promising approach which not only economical and efficient but also exert little impact on water bodies sahinkaya et al 2017 immobilized microorganism technologies involve the immobilization of bacterial cells onto a carrier which can effectively support the development of microbial communities and maintain the predominance of embedded bacteria in addition magnetic bio adsorbents have been widely used for heavy metal removal through adsorption processes sahu et al 2019 therefore a combination of carriers for immobilization and magnetic adsorption may not only serve as a support for biofilm formation and development but also enhance the heavy metal removal efficiency of bioreactors in this study a simultaneous denitrification mn ii and cd ii removal bioreactor was developed using ppy fe3o4 pva a novel multifunctional immobilized material the novel ppy fe3o4 pva material was synthesized and characterized to demonstrate its potential for microbial immobilization the ppy fe3o4 pva biofilm reactor performance was assessed during operation to determine the influence of various operating parameters on the biofilm performance such as hrt initial mn ii concentration and initial cd ii concentration gas emissions from the ppy fe3o4 pva biofilm reactor were analysed to investigate the nitrogen removal mechanism of the bioreactor furthermore 454 high throughput pyrosequencing was applied to reveal the bacterial diversity and dominant microbial communities in the ppy fe3o4 pva biofilm reactor 2 materials and methods 2 1 microorganism and culture pseudomonas sp h117 an anaerobic denitrifying bacterium has an efficient capability of simultaneous remove nitrate cd ii and mn ii the mixotrophic medium mm used in this study was specially designed for pseudomonas sp h117 which can simultaneously utilize mn ii and sodium acetate as electron donors for denitrification mm consisted of a mixed solution of per liter 0 5 g of nahco3 0 175 g of ch3coona 0 1 g of kh2po4 0 05 g of mgso4 7h2o 0 05 g of cacl2 and 2 ml of trace elements solution the components of trace elements solution were as follows per liter 0 5 g mgso4 7h2o 1 0 g edta 0 2 g znso4 0 1 g mncl2 4h2o 0 5 g feso4 7h2o 0 5 g cuso4 5h2o and 0 2 g cocl2 6 h2o the final ph of mm was adjusted to 7 0 su et al 2019a mncl2 4h2o and cdcl2 2 5h2o were dissolved in sterilized distilled water to prepare concentrated mn ii and cd ii stock solutions to control the concentration of mn ii and cd ii in influent 2 2 synthesis and characterization of ppy fe3o4 pva ppy fe3o4 pva was synthesized using the method reported by aigbe et al 2017 with some modifications the brief synthesis process was as follows 8 5 g of nh4 2fe so4 2 h2o and 17 g of fecl3 h2o were combined in 100 ml of deionized water and sonicated for 15 min to ensure thorough mixing then 0 30 g of polyvinyl alcohol pva sponge cube 1 1 1 cm was added to the solution and after that 15 g of fecl3 was added to the reaction solution the solution was heated and maintained at a temperature of 50 c then ammonia hydroxide 33 25 ml was rapidly added to the mixture with continual agitation by glass rod pyrrole 3 ml was then added to the magnetite suspension by syringe the mixture solution was shaken manually for 5 min at room temperature and then left stationary at room temperature for 3 h to ensure complete polymerization the obtained ppy fe3o4 pva material was washed sequentially with distilled water and then acetone until the filtrate appeared colorless the composite ppy fe3o4 pva material was then dried under vacuum at 60 c for over 24 h to investigate the materials nitrate mn ii and cd ii removal efficiencies at different concentrations batch tests were carried out at five concentrations of ppy fe3o4 pva different concentrations of ppy fe3o4 pva were added to mm with 5 bacterium inoculation media was sampled on the first and third day to determine initial and final concentrations of nitrate mn ii and cd ii respectively 2 3 regeneration experiments material recycling experiments were performed to evaluate the regeneration capability of ppy fe3o4 pva experiments were carried out under the optimal conditions of a temperature of 30 c initial ph of 7 0 initial mn ii and cd ii concentrations of 50 mg l and 10 mg l respectively and ppy fe3o4 concentration of 300 mg l at the end of each cycle ppy fe3o4 was collected and washed 3 times with sterilized deionized water following this the material was sterilized at 121 c for 30 min before the next cycle of use material was cycled 10 times the concentrations of mn ii cd ii and nitrate were measured at the beginning and end of each cycle three parallel tests were performed simultaneously for each regeneration experiment 2 4 reactor set up and operational conditions the biofilm reactor consisted of three main components inlet tank intake pump and the mixotrophic bioreactor synthetic water mm containing different mn ii and cd ii concentrations was added to the bioreactor at a set rate via the intake pump the bioreactor was filled with ppy fe3o4 pva biomaterial at a 30 filling ratio two parallel reactors were run for the entire duration of the experiment one reactor was used as the control reactor operating with the ppy fe3o4 pva material but without inoculation with immobilized bacteria while the experimental reactor contained the ppy fe3o4 pva material and immobilized bacteria all other operational conditions were consistent for the control group and the experimental group prior to the onset of the experimental period the bioreactor ran for a period of seven days to allow immobilization of bacteria and stabilization of the reactor reactors were operated continuously and steadily for 105 days as shown in table 1 bioreactor operational periods were divided into 15 phases according to the different conditions samples were collected periodically to measure the concentrations of nitrate n nitrite n mn ii and cd ii 2 5 detection of gas emission the gas emission of bioreactor was investigated according to previous research in short experiment was performed in bioreactor which sealed with a rubber stopper the gas sample in the headspace of the bottle was collected by inserting a gas tight syringe into the rubber stopper 10 ml samples were taken from the bottle to analyze gas composition using gas chromatography the n2 and co2 in gas product was measured using a perkinelmer clarus 680 gas chromatograph equipped with a txd 01 column equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd and a 2 m carbon molecular sieve tdx 01 column li et al 2017 n2o was measured by a gas chromatography perkinelmer clarus 600 american equipped with porapak q column on the gc kai zhi china with ecd detector perkinelmer clarus 600 american the carrier gas when measuring n2 and co2 is he and when measuring n2o is n2 su et al 2018 2 6 analyses of high throughput sequencing 454 high throughput pyrosequencing method was used to investigate the diversity and abundance of bacterial communities the v1 and v3 hypervariable regions were targeted by the pcr amplification the high throughput sequencing primers were 338f 50 actcctacgggaggcagca 30 and 806r 50 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 30 the pyrosequencing procedure the program of pcr amplification and the sequence analysis were followed by previous research su et al 2019b 2 7 analytical methods the material was tested via scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 5800 japan jeol and x ray diffractometer xrd rigaku ultimate4 experiments to analyze the morphology main components as well as crystal structure properties the concentrations of nitrate nitrite and mn ii were determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometer dr 5000 hach the usa according to standard methods the concentration of cd ii was determined by the atomic absorption spectrophotometer ice 3500 usa the ph value was measured with the ph meter mm110 hach america 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and characterization of ppy fe3o4 pva pva and ppy fe3o4 pva were observed by sem and according to the sem micrographs fig 1 a pva exhibited a smooth surface morphology with a three dimensional interconnected network skeleton furthermore no cavities or protrusions were visible on its surface after being loaded by ppy fe3o4 the materials morphology changed significantly fig 1 b exhibiting the formation of a mesh skeleton structure with a rough surface furthermore a number of small size ppy fe3o4 particles were formed and irregularly arranged on pva surfaces fig 1 f displays the xrd patterns of the pva and ppy fe3o4 pva materials the pattern of ppy fe3o4 pva showed three diffraction peaks at 35 468 57 006 and 62 600 corresponding to fe3o4 aigbe et al 2017 when comparing the xrd patterns for the two materials the obvious presence of ppy fe3o4 on the pva surface indicated that ppy fe3o4 had been successfully loaded onto the pva surface the porous pva sponge cube had well developed porous surface structures in addition the rough surface and mesh structure of ppy fe3o4 pva provided favorable conditions for bacterial immobilization and biofilm formation resulting in the advantages of higher metabolic activity and longer cell retention times within bioreactors shen et al 2017 therefore the synthesized ppy fe3o4 pva material was appropriate for the immobilization of microorganisms 3 2 effect of ppy fe3o4 pva concentration on denitrification mn ii and cd ii removal efficiency different concentrations of ppy fe3o4 pva were assessed to investigate the effect of ppy fe3o4 pva concentration on denitrification mn ii and cd ii removal efficiency the results presented in fig 2 a show that varying ppy fe3o4 pva concentration had little effect on the nitrate removal efficiency with final nitrate concentrations consistently close to 0 and nitrate removal ratios at 100 it is of note a higher nitrate removal rate was observed with increasing ppy fe3o4 pva concentrations when the ppy fe3o4 pva concentration reached 300 mg l the nitrate removal rate tended to stabilize and remain at 0 207 mg l 1 h 1 while the nitrate removal rate increased by 27 05 in comparison to that when no material was added 0 151 mg l 1 h 1 this phenomenon was consistent with the results of a previous study showing that immobilized cells exhibit higher cyanide removal efficiency than free cells li et al 2019 immobilized microbe reactors can provide more effective pollutant removal as they can increase cell retention time and greatly improve the growth and metabolism of organisms kerčmar and pintar 2017 pseudomonas sp h117 has previously been shown to have high mn ii oxidation capability during the process of denitrification the mechanism of cd ii removal shown in fig 5 b is mainly related to the absorption of mno2 which created during the biological activities the large surface area of manganese oxide makes it a promising candidate for the absorption of heavy metals from polluted water in addition with the increase in ph during denitrification cd oh may be formed which can be adsorbed more easily by mno2 meanwhile the surface charge of manganese oxide will become negative which is favorable for positively charged cd species adsorption su et al 2019a therefore the mn ii oxidation ratio was investigated to research the cd ii removal efficiency as shown in fig 2 b the concentration of ppy fe3o4 pva had an obvious effect on the mn ii oxidation ratio with the increase in ppy fe3o4 pva concentration from 0 mg l to 300 mg l the mn ii oxidation ratio increased rapidly when the concentration of ppy fe3o4 pva reached 300 mg l the maximum mn ii oxidation ratio of 90 98 0 475 mg l 1 h 1 was obtained showing an increase by 30 27 compared with the mn ii oxidation ratio of 60 71 in the absence of ppy fe3o4 pva further increasing the concentration of ppy fe3o4 pva did not induce any further improvement in the mn ii oxidation ratio according to fig 2 c when the ppy fe3o4 pva concentration increased from 0 mg l to 300 mg l the cd ii removal efficiency increased remarkably the cd ii removal ratio reached a maximum of 98 78 when the concentration of ppy fe3o4 pva was 300 mg l showing an increased by 16 48 compared with the cd ii removal ratio of 82 30 in the absence of ppy fe3o4 pva further increases in the concentration of ppy fe3o4 pva to 400 mg l did not result in a significant increase in the cd ii removal efficiency when comparing fig 2 b and fig 2 c it can be seen that the trend of variation in cd ii effluent concentrations were highly correlated with the trend of mn ii concentrations variation this phenomenon is due to the removal of cd ii by adsorption to biological manganese oxide where an increase in biological mno2 production would result in an improved cd ii removal efficiency nielsen et al 2018 overall these findings indicate that ppy fe3o4 pva is a powerful biomaterial which can effectively enhance the efficiency of denitrification and improve the efficiency of mn ii and cd ii removal in bioreactor systems when the concentration of ppy fe3o4 pva was 300 mg l the combined efficiency of nitrate mn ii and cd ii removal was at the maximum observed level as a result ppy fe3o4 pva concentrations of 300 mg l were applied in all following experiments 3 3 regenerative capacity of ppy fe3o4 pva the reusability of an adsorbent is one of the most important performance aspects that must be evaluated for a new material prior to practical application lv et al 2016 in order to research the stability and regenerative capacity of ppy fe3o4 pva the material was reused for 10 consecutive cycles under the previously established optimum conditions cd ii concentration of 10 mg l mn ii concentration of 50 mg l temperature of 30 c the relationship between nitrate mn ii and cd ii removal efficiencies and the number of cycles of reuse are presented in fig 3 with increasing numbers of material reuse cycles the nitrate removal ratio did not decrease and remained stable at nearly 100 while the increase in material reuse cycles did not significantly affect nitrate removal it had a greater effect on the mn ii and cd ii oxidation ratio the mn ii oxidation ratio decreased from 94 16 to 74 60 after ten cycles of reuse remaining above 90 in the first four cycles the cd ii removal ratio also decreased with the increase of the number of material cycles when the number of material cycles increased to ten the removal ratio of cd ii reduced from 98 30 to 89 53 fig 1 c e showed the ppy fe3o4 pva material sem images after reuse for one cycle five cycles and ten cycles it can be seen that some of the ppy fe3o4 loaded on the surface of pva was lost due to repetitive scouring in the regeneration process weakening bacterial immobilization while the cd ii removal ratio in the first six cycles remained above 97 overall the mn ii oxidation ratio and cd ii removal ratio after ten cycles of ppy fe3o4 pva reuse remained higher than in the absence of ppy fe3o4 pva these results indicate that ppy fe3o4 pva has excellent stability and reusability as a bacterial fixation material 3 4 simultaneous nitrate mn ii and cd ii removal performance of the ppy fe3o4 pva biofilm reactor the denitrification mn ii and cd ii removal performance of the ppy fe3o4 pva immobilized bacteria biofilm reactor is shown in fig 4 fifteen experimental periods with varying hrt conditions and concentrations of mn ii and cd ii were used to compare the simultaneous nitrate cd ii and mn ii removal efficiency 3 4 1 effect of hydraulic retention time hrt on bioreactor performance in the initial three operational periods the influent cd ii concentration was set at 10 mg l and the influent mn ii concentration was at 20 mg l while the hrt was increased from 6 h to 10 h in the first three periods to assess the optimal hrt of the bioreactor fig 4 a shows that with a gradual increase in the hrt the nitrate concentration in effluent significantly decreased and the denitrification efficiency increased from 57 11 to 74 30 this result indicates that a higher hrt has a positive impact on the denitrification process which could be linked to variations in bacterial community development under different hrts rodriguezsanchez et al 2018 under longer hrt conditions bacteria could have sufficient time to achieve high microbial activity and nitrate removal efficiency at the same time it was observed that nitrite accumulation occurred when the hrt was 6 h and the highest level of accumulation reached 1 64 mg l while the concentration of nitrite declined with an increase in hrt from 6 h to 10 h nitrite accumulation disappeared when the hrt was 10 h this suggests that the bacteria have achieved complete denitrification guo et al 2016 also reported that sufficient contact time with denitrifying bacteria can achieve complete nitrate reduction in contaminated water in addition the mn ii removal ratio increased from 32 10 to 52 10 and the cd ii removal rate increased from 31 43 to 54 69 fig 4 c d these results verify that longer hrt s can effectively improve the simultaneous mn ii and cd ii removal efficiencies the same results were also observed from period 6 to 8 and from period 11 to 13 at which point the hrt was changed from 6 to 8 h under different cd ii concentrations therefore 10 h was selected as the optimal hrt for simultaneous nitrate mn ii and cd ii removal in subsequent bioreactor experiments 3 4 2 effect of initial mn ii concentration on bioreactor performance from period 3 to period 5 the initial concentration of mn ii increased from 20 mg l to 60 mg l the hrt conditions and cd ii concentration did not change from period 3 to period 5 it can be seen from fig 4 a that the effluent nitrate concentration reduced distinctly when the initial mn ii concentration changed from 20 mg l to 40 mg l the nitrate removal ratio remained at 100 with a denitrification rate of 1 665 mg l 1 h 1 when the initial mn ii concentration was 40 mg l meanwhile nitrite accumulation disappeared rapidly although some accumulation appeared in the initial stage of period 4 fig 4 b all these trends could be due to manganese divalent ion and sodium acetate participating in the process of mixotrophic denitrification as mixed electron donors when the initial mn ii concentration increased bacteria gained more inorganic electron donors for denitrification allowing nitrate to be removed more effectively in addition the effect of mn ii concentration on cd ii removal efficiency was observed further supporting the results of previous study showing that the cd ii removal efficiency of biofilm reactors are closely associated with the adsorption capability of biogenic manganese oxides the results presented in fig 4 c show that mn ii oxidation efficiency rapidly increased to 91 16 3 597 mg l 1 h 1 when the initial mn ii concentration increased to 40 mg l period 4 this may due to denitrifying bacteria achieving better activity when the mn ii concentration was 40 mg l as mn ii can be used as an electron donor during the denitrification process resulting in an increased manganese oxidation ratio it is of note that the cd ii concentration in effluent significantly decreased and the cd ii removal ratio reached 96 19 0 915 mg l 1 h 1 when the initial mn ii concentration increased to 40 mg l this phenomenon may because compared with synthetic δ mno2 and commercially available mn oxides biogenic mn oxides usually have higher specific surface areas that provide more cd ii adsorption sites zhang et al 2002 in addition biogenic mn oxides have been shown to have more binding energy per unit surface area miyata et al 2007 furthermore the process of denitrification could cause the ph to rise increasing the number of negatively charged sites on the surface of manganese oxides therefore cd ii adsorption occurred due to cation exchange or complexation at surface sites su et al 2019a however as the mn ii concentration increased to 60 mg l period 5 the nitrate removal ratio reduced to 81 39 with a lower removal rate of 1 307 mg l 1 h 1 at the same time nitrite accumulation was higher and the rate of nitrite removal was slower than in period 4 this suggests that when the concentration of mn ii continually increased excessively high concentrations of mn ii may inhibit bacterial activity which may be due to excessive mn ii concentrations disrupting the reactive oxygen metabolic balance in the system zhang et al 2019b in addition the presence of high metal ion concentrations would damage the microbial enzyme conformation and block essential functional groups liu et al 2018 this may account for the decline in mn ii oxidation efficiency to 73 71 and the cd ii removal ratio to 76 79 due to the toxic effect of high mn ii concentrations on bacteria the same phenomenon was also observed from period 8 to 10 and from period 14 to 15 at which point mn ii concentrations ranged from 20 to 60 mg l under different cd ii concentrations therefore the optimum mn ii concentration for simultaneous removal of nitrate mn ii and cd ii was established as 40 mg l 3 4 3 effect of initial cd ii concentration on bioreactor performance to measure the effect of cd ii concentration on the performance of the ppy fe3o4 pva biofilm reactor periods 4 9 and 14 were compared periods 4 9 and 14 all had an hrt of 10 h and an initial mn ii concentration of 40 mg l with initial cd ii concentrations of 10 20 and 30 mg l respectively as illustrated in fig 4 the nitrate concentration in effluent increased as the cd ii concentration changed from 10 mg l to 30 mg l and the denitrification efficiency decreased from 100 1 665 mg l 1 h 1 to 84 81 1 395 mg l 1 h 1 in addition the mn ii oxidation efficiency declined from 91 16 3 597 mg l 1 h 1 to 65 39 2 565 mg l 1 h 1 results show that an increase in initial cd ii concentration resulted in a negative effect on the denitrification and manganese oxidation rates meanwhile nitrite accumulation increased and the nitrite removal rate was reduced as the cd ii concentration changed from 10 mg l to 30 mg l this effect may be due to cd ii destroying the integrity of the cytomembrane and inhibiting the process of nitrate and nitrite reduction li et al 2018 previous studies have reported the same results showing that compared to the nitrate removal efficiencies obtained without metals the addition of heavy metals at a concentration of 40 mg l resulted in 3 fold lower nitrate removal efficiencies kiskira et al 2018 in addition the effect of initial mn ii concentrations on the resistance of the bioreactor to cd ii was assessed when the influent mn ii concentration was 20 mg l and the cd ii concentration increased from 10 mg l in period 3 to 20 mg l in period 8 and 30 mg l in period 13 the nitrate removal ratio reduced by 14 00 from period 3 to 8 and by 27 07 from period 8 to 13 when the influent mn ii concentration increased to 40 mg l periods 4 9 and 14 the nitrate removal ratio decreased by 3 61 from period 4 to 9 and by 15 19 from period 9 to 14 when the influent mn ii concentration was 60 mg l periods 5 10 and 15 the nitrate removal ratio decreased by 7 50 from period 5 to 10 and by 21 40 from period 10 to 15 this phenomenon shows that the bioreactor had the lowest resistance to cd ii at an initial mn ii concentration of 20 mg l however increased mn ii concentrations enhanced the resistance of the reactor to cd ii toxicity with the strongest resistance obtained when the initial mn ii concentration was 40 mg l this suggests that mn ii may play a significant role in microbial resistance to cd ii toxicity enhancing microbial catabolic activity as an available electron donor nevertheless continual increase of manganese concentrations to 60 mg l would inhibit bacterial growth thereby reducing the reactors resistance to cd ii toxicity 3 5 detection of gaseous nitrogen compounds to further investigate the nitrogen removal mechanism of the ppy fe3o4 pva bioreactor an experiment with an hrt of 10 h mn ii concentration of 40 mg l and cd ii concentration of 10 mg l same as period 4 was undertaken to assess the gas product gas chromatography gc was used to measure the composition of the gas product in the reactor fig 5 shows that 99 15 of nitrogen and 0 08 of carbon dioxide were detected while no n2o was detected in the bioreactor gas product this indicates that n2 was the main end product in the denitrification process which is in accordance with the results reported by itokawa et al 2001 carbon dioxide is a metabolic by product which produces the energy required for an organisms growth and reproduction in this study the ratio of co2 in gaseous product emissions was consistently at a low level of 0 08 this may be due to a lower carbon load under mixotrophic conditions resulting in less co2 emissions ren et al 2015 moreover the denitrification process produced alkalinity which may result in partial co2 conversion to hco3 and co3 2 and lead to a decrease in co2 emissions chen et al 2019 n2o is an intermediate in the denitrification process and has been reported as a greenhouses gas which threaten the ozone layer of the twenty first century yao et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 therefore no n2o detection in the gas product suggests that denitrification was performed completely in the ppy fe3o4 pva biofilm reactor and that this system would not induce adverse environmental effects 3 6 bacterial community diversity analysis fig 6 shows the change in microbial community structure and composition under different cd ii concentrations sample y0 was taken from the control reactor no bacteria added in period 4 and was assessed as a control samples y1 y2 and y3 were collected from experimental groups y1 from period 4 hrt of 10 h influent mn ii of 40 mg l and influent cd ii of 10 mg l y2 from period 9 hrt of 10 h influent mn ii of 40 mg l and influent cd ii of 20 mg l and y3 from period 14 hrt of 10 h influent mn ii of 40 mg l and influent cd ii of 30 mg l as shown in fig 6 a the main phyla categories of the four samples included proteobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and actinobacteria it was observed that proteobacteria had the highest proportion in all samples assessed the abundance of proteobacteria in the four samples were 38 43 in y0 87 57 in y1 75 50 in y2 and 64 33 in y3 according to previous studies strain h117 belongs to proteobacteria phyla which may play a dominant role in the denitrifying microbial community this is in accordance with the reported results of karanasios et al 2010 that most denitrifying bacteria belong to proteobacteria in addition these results indicate that with the increase in initial cd ii concentration the growth of proteobacteria were inhibited while other phyla showed irregular changes the denitrification efficiency mn ii oxidation efficiency and cd ii removal rate decreased gradually with increasing cd ii concentrations as discussed in section 3 4 therefore a correlation was observed between microbial community changes in proteobacteria phyla and the nitrate mn ii and cd ii removal performance this indicates that the immobilized pseudomonas sp h117 in the reactor may play a significant role in microbial community structure and the removal of nitrate mn ii and cd ii from the bioreactor fig 6 b presents microbial community dynamics at the class level gammaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria sphingobacteria bacilli and alphaproteobacteria were identified as the main classes in samples y1 y2 and y3 it has been reported that gammaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria sphingobacteriia and bacilli play a key role in denitrifying systems wang et al 2018b gammaproteobacteria were the dominate class in samples y1 y2 and y3 with the increase in initial cd ii concentration gammaproteobacteria dramatically decreased in abundance from 76 81 to 42 07 although they remained dominant in the reactor this may due to cd ii inhibiting the growth and reproduction of gammaproteobacteria compared with the bioreactor performance in section 3 4 the microbial community change of class gammaproteobacteria was highly correlated with the denitrification mn ii and cd ii removal efficiencies in the bioreactor which both presented a downward trend with initial cd ii concentrations from 10 mg l to 30 mg l as previously reported su et al 2019b the target bacteria h117 immobilized in the reactor belongs to gammaproteobacteria therefore gammaproteobacteria h117 plays an important role in the simultaneous denitrification mn ii and cd ii removal in the reactor in addition the class betaproteobacteria increased from 13 28 to 21 81 and sphingobacteriia and bacilli also increased slightly at the same time these results suggest that these classes may be more competitive in heavy metal containing environments which corresponds with previously reported research qian et al 2017 to further investigate the similarities and differences among samples bacterial communities were evaluated at the genus level by heatmap as shown in fig 6 c 50 species were identified at the genus level in samples y0 y1 y2 and y3 results showed that pseudomonas was detected in all samples and accounted for the highest proportion in samples y1 y2 and y3 the relative abundance of pseudomonas in samples y1 y2 and y3 were 20 22 16 21 and 11 13 respectively the abundance of pseudomonas decreased with increasing cd ii concentrations from 10 mg l to 30 mg l which indicates that higher concentrations of cd ii increased toxicity in the reactor and inhibited the enrichment of pseudomonas and the performance of denitrification mn ii and cd ii removal 4 conclusion this study developed an efficient simultaneous denitrification mn ii and cd ii removal ppy fe3o4 pva bioreactor morphological analysis demonstrated that ppy fe3o4 pva has a well developed porous structures and rough surface for bacterial immobilization according to the batch tests results the optimal concentration of ppy fe3o4 pva was 300 mg l in addition the ppy fe3o4 pva material retained high removal efficiency after 10 cycles of regeneration and reuse during operation the reactor achieved a maximum denitrification efficiency of 100 1 665 mg l 1 h 1 with mn ii and cd ii removal efficiencies of 91 16 3 597 mg l 1 h 1 and 96 19 0 915 mg l 1 h 1 achieved at an hrt of 10 h initial mn ii concentration of 40 mg l and initial cd ii concentration of 10 mg l analysis of gaseous nitrogen compounds confirmed that n2 was the gaseous end product during reactor

18400,the co existence of multiple pollutants in wastewater such as nitrate and heavy metal is of high concern due to the potential environmental impact in this study a novel biomaterial ppy fe3o4 pva was synthesized as a multifunctional bacteria immobilized carrier to enhance simultaneous denitrification cd ii and mn ii removal efficiency in bioreactor environments the morphology and main components of the ppy fe3o4 pva material were characterized by sem and xrd using ppy fe3o4 pva as a carrier the maximum removal efficiencies for nitrate 0 207 mg l 1 h 1 mn ii 90 98 and cd ii 98 78 were increased by 27 05 30 27 and 16 48 respectively compared to in the absence of ppy fe3o4 pva regeneration experiments were performed demonstrating the excellent stability and reusability of the ppy fe3o4 pva material furthermore effects of key factors were investigated on the performance of the ppy fe3o4 pva bioreactor in simultaneous denitrification mn ii and cd ii removal experimental

fe3o4 pva biomaterial biofilm reactor community diversity 1 introduction the co existence of multiple pollutants in natural water contaminated groundwater or wastewater such as nitrates and heavy metals is of high concern worldwide capua et al 2015 li et al 2016a nitrate is mainly introduced into water due to industrial activities and excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers as well as the discharge of domestic sewage zhang et al 2019c during natural environment changes or human activities nitrate can be reduced to nitrite exposure to both nitrate and nitrite can pose a threat to human health such as methemoglobinemia and carcinogenic diseases zou et al 2016 zhang et al 2019a the world health organization who has set a limit of 50 mg l nitrate concentration in drinking water li et al 2016b biological methods of nitrate removal have gained increasing research interest as they have been found to be an effective way to decrease nitrogen pollution in aquatic ecosystems without inducing secondary pollution zhou et al 2016 wang et al 2018a due to metallurgical industry activities chemical fertilizer application and sewage sludge treatment heavy metal pollution has become a serious threat to the environment and human health kang and so 2016 kerjaschki et al 2014 many toxic heavy metals are water soluble and not biodegradable therefore they are transported by water and accumulate in aquatic organisms colantonio and kim 2016 cadmium is one of the most toxic elements which contributes to the potential environmental risk huang et al 2016 which mainly harmful to the kidneys and liver of human body aoshima 2016 various conventional methods have been reported to remediate the heavy metal pollutant from contaminated water including ion exchange chemical oxidation chemical precipitation processes membrane filtration and electrochemical treatment lu et al 2015 wu et al 2019 carolin et al 2017 however these methods present some disadvantages such as high energy requirements incomplete removal excessive sludge production requirement of further treatment and so on kurniawan et al 2006 consequently it is necessary to find an efficient and low cost method to remove heavy metals from wastewater it has been reported that the growth of some microorganisms such as bacteria fungi and yeast leads to effectively biological removal of heavy metals from wastewater fernández et al 2018 jacob et al 2018 nielsen et al 2018 biosorption processes by biosorbents have proven to have great potential for the removal of heavy metals from industrial wastewater vendruscolo et al 2017 for complex polluted water such as nitrate and heavy metal contaminated water biological methods combined denitrification and heavy metals removal is a promising approach which not only economical and efficient but also exert little impact on water bodies sahinkaya et al 2017 immobilized microorganism technologies involve the immobilization of bacterial cells onto a carrier which can effectively support the development of microbial communities and maintain the predominance of embedded bacteria in addition magnetic bio adsorbents have been widely used for heavy metal removal through adsorption processes sahu et al 2019 therefore a combination of carriers for immobilization and magnetic adsorption may not only serve as a support for biofilm formation and development but also enhance the heavy metal removal efficiency of bioreactors in this study a simultaneous denitrification mn ii and cd ii removal bioreactor was developed using ppy fe3o4 pva a novel multifunctional immobilized material the novel ppy fe3o4 pva material was synthesized and characterized to demonstrate its potential for microbial immobilization the ppy fe3o4 pva biofilm reactor performance was assessed during operation to determine the influence of various operating parameters on the biofilm performance such as hrt initial mn ii concentration and initial cd ii concentration gas emissions from the ppy fe3o4 pva biofilm reactor were analysed to investigate the nitrogen removal mechanism of the bioreactor furthermore 454 high throughput pyrosequencing was applied to reveal the bacterial diversity and dominant microbial communities in the ppy fe3o4 pva biofilm reactor 2 materials and methods 2 1 microorganism and culture pseudomonas sp h117 an anaerobic denitrifying bacterium has an efficient capability of simultaneous remove nitrate cd ii and mn ii the mixotrophic medium mm used in this study was specially designed for pseudomonas sp h117 which can simultaneously utilize mn ii and sodium acetate as electron donors for denitrification mm consisted of a mixed solution of per liter 0 5 g of nahco3 0 175 g of ch3coona 0 1 g of kh2po4 0 05 g of mgso4 7h2o 0 05 g of cacl2 and 2 ml of trace elements solution the components of trace elements solution were as follows per liter 0 5 g mgso4 7h2o 1 0 g edta 0 2 g znso4 0 1 g mncl2 4h2o 0 5 g feso4 7h2o 0 5 g cuso4 5h2o and 0 2 g cocl2 6 h2o the final ph of mm was adjusted to 7 0 su et al 2019a mncl2 4h2o and cdcl2 2 5h2o were dissolved in sterilized distilled water to prepare concentrated mn ii and cd ii stock solutions to control the concentration of mn ii and cd ii in influent 2 2 synthesis and characterization of ppy fe3o4 pva ppy fe3o4 pva was synthesized using the method reported by aigbe et al 2017 with some modifications the brief synthesis process was as follows 8 5 g of nh4 2fe so4 2 h2o and 17 g of fecl3 h2o were combined in 100 ml of deionized water and sonicated for 15 min to ensure thorough mixing then 0 30 g of polyvinyl alcohol pva sponge cube 1 1 1 cm was added to the solution and after that 15 g of fecl3 was added to the reaction solution the solution was heated and maintained at a temperature of 50 c then ammonia hydroxide 33 25 ml was rapidly added to the mixture with continual agitation by glass rod pyrrole 3 ml was then added to the magnetite suspension by syringe the mixture solution was shaken manually for 5 min at room temperature and then left stationary at room temperature for 3 h to ensure complete polymerization the obtained ppy fe3o4 pva material was washed sequentially with distilled water and then acetone until the filtrate appeared colorless the composite ppy fe3o4 pva material was then dried under vacuum at 60 c for over 24 h to investigate the materials nitrate mn ii and cd ii removal efficiencies at different concentrations batch tests were carried out at five concentrations of ppy fe3o4 pva different concentrations of ppy fe3o4 pva were added to mm with 5 bacterium inoculation media was sampled on the first and third day to determine initial and final concentrations of nitrate mn ii and cd ii respectively 2 3 regeneration experiments material recycling experiments were performed to evaluate the regeneration capability of ppy fe3o4 pva experiments were carried out under the optimal conditions of a temperature of 30 c initial ph of 7 0 initial mn ii and cd ii concentrations of 50 mg l and 10 mg l respectively and ppy fe3o4 concentration of 300 mg l at the end of each cycle ppy fe3o4 was collected and washed 3 times with sterilized deionized water following this the material was sterilized at 121 c for 30 min before the next cycle of use material was cycled 10 times the concentrations of mn ii cd ii and nitrate were measured at the beginning and end of each cycle three parallel tests were performed simultaneously for each regeneration experiment 2 4 reactor set up and operational conditions the biofilm reactor consisted of three main components inlet tank intake pump and the mixotrophic bioreactor synthetic water mm containing different mn ii and cd ii concentrations was added to the bioreactor at a set rate via the intake pump the bioreactor was filled with ppy fe3o4 pva biomaterial at a 30 filling ratio two parallel reactors were run for the entire duration of the experiment one reactor was used as the control reactor operating with the ppy fe3o4 pva material but without inoculation with immobilized bacteria while the experimental reactor contained the ppy fe3o4 pva material and immobilized bacteria all other operational conditions were consistent for the control group and the experimental group prior to the onset of the experimental period the bioreactor ran for a period of seven days to allow immobilization of bacteria and stabilization of the reactor reactors were operated continuously and steadily for 105 days as shown in table 1 bioreactor operational periods were divided into 15 phases according to the different conditions samples were collected periodically to measure the concentrations of nitrate n nitrite n mn ii and cd ii 2 5 detection of gas emission the gas emission of bioreactor was investigated according to previous research in short experiment was performed in bioreactor which sealed with a rubber stopper the gas sample in the headspace of the bottle was collected by inserting a gas tight syringe into the rubber stopper 10 ml samples were taken from the bottle to analyze gas composition using gas chromatography the n2 and co2 in gas product was measured using a perkinelmer clarus 680 gas chromatograph equipped with a txd 01 column equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd and a 2 m carbon molecular sieve tdx 01 column li et al 2017 n2o was measured by a gas chromatography perkinelmer clarus 600 american equipped with porapak q column on the gc kai zhi china with ecd detector perkinelmer clarus 600 american the carrier gas when measuring n2 and co2 is he and when measuring n2o is n2 su et al 2018 2 6 analyses of high throughput sequencing 454 high throughput pyrosequencing method was used to investigate the diversity and abundance of bacterial communities the v1 and v3 hypervariable regions were targeted by the pcr amplification the high throughput sequencing primers were 338f 50 actcctacgggaggcagca 30 and 806r 50 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 30 the pyrosequencing procedure the program of pcr amplification and the sequence analysis were followed by previous research su et al 2019b 2 7 analytical methods the material was tested via scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 5800 japan jeol and x ray diffractometer xrd rigaku ultimate4 experiments to analyze the morphology main components as well as crystal structure properties the concentrations of nitrate nitrite and mn ii were determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometer dr 5000 hach the usa according to standard methods the concentration of cd ii was determined by the atomic absorption spectrophotometer ice 3500 usa the ph value was measured with the ph meter mm110 hach america 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and characterization of ppy fe3o4 pva pva and ppy fe3o4 pva were observed by sem and according to the sem micrographs fig 1 a pva exhibited a smooth surface morphology with a three dimensional interconnected network skeleton furthermore no cavities or protrusions were visible on its surface after being loaded by ppy fe3o4 the materials morphology changed significantly fig 1 b exhibiting the formation of a mesh skeleton structure with a rough surface furthermore a number of small size ppy fe3o4 particles were formed and irregularly arranged on pva surfaces fig 1 f displays the xrd patterns of the pva and ppy fe3o4 pva materials the pattern of ppy fe3o4 pva showed three diffraction peaks at 35 468 57 006 and 62 600 corresponding to fe3o4 aigbe et al 2017 when comparing the xrd patterns for the two materials the obvious presence of ppy fe3o4 on the pva surface indicated that ppy fe3o4 had been successfully loaded onto the pva surface the porous pva sponge cube had well developed porous surface structures in addition the rough surface and mesh structure of ppy fe3o4 pva provided favorable conditions for bacterial immobilization and biofilm formation resulting in the advantages of higher metabolic activity and longer cell retention times within bioreactors shen et al 2017 therefore the synthesized ppy fe3o4 pva material was appropriate for the immobilization of microorganisms 3 2 effect of ppy fe3o4 pva concentration on denitrification mn ii and cd ii removal efficiency different concentrations of ppy fe3o4 pva were assessed to investigate the effect of ppy fe3o4 pva concentration on denitrification mn ii and cd ii removal efficiency the results presented in fig 2 a show that varying ppy fe3o4 pva concentration had little effect on the nitrate removal efficiency with final nitrate concentrations consistently close to 0 and nitrate removal ratios at 100 it is of note a higher nitrate removal rate was observed with increasing ppy fe3o4 pva concentrations when the ppy fe3o4 pva concentration reached 300 mg l the nitrate removal rate tended to stabilize and remain at 0 207 mg l 1 h 1 while the nitrate removal rate increased by 27 05 in comparison to that when no material was added 0 151 mg l 1 h 1 this phenomenon was consistent with the results of a previous study showing that immobilized cells exhibit higher cyanide removal efficiency than free cells li et al 2019 immobilized microbe reactors can provide more effective pollutant removal as they can increase cell retention time and greatly improve the growth and metabolism of organisms kerčmar and pintar 2017 pseudomonas sp h117 has previously been shown to have high mn ii oxidation capability during the process of denitrification the mechanism of cd ii removal shown in fig 5 b is mainly related to the absorption of mno2 which created during the biological activities the large surface area of manganese oxide makes it a promising candidate for the absorption of heavy metals from polluted water in addition with the increase in ph during denitrification cd oh may be formed which can be adsorbed more easily by mno2 meanwhile the surface charge of manganese oxide will become negative which is favorable for positively charged cd species adsorption su et al 2019a therefore the mn ii oxidation ratio was investigated to research the cd ii removal efficiency as shown in fig 2 b the concentration of ppy fe3o4 pva had an obvious effect on the mn ii oxidation ratio with the increase in ppy fe3o4 pva concentration from 0 mg l to 300 mg l the mn ii oxidation ratio increased rapidly when the concentration of ppy fe3o4 pva reached 300 mg l the maximum mn ii oxidation ratio of 90 98 0 475 mg l 1 h 1 was obtained showing an increase by 30 27 compared with the mn ii oxidation ratio of 60 71 in the absence of ppy fe3o4 pva further increasing the concentration of ppy fe3o4 pva did not induce any further improvement in the mn ii oxidation ratio according to fig 2 c when the ppy fe3o4 pva concentration increased from 0 mg l to 300 mg l the cd ii removal efficiency increased remarkably the cd ii removal ratio reached a maximum of 98 78 when the concentration of ppy fe3o4 pva was 300 mg l showing an increased by 16 48 compared with the cd ii removal ratio of 82 30 in the absence of ppy fe3o4 pva further increases in the concentration of ppy fe3o4 pva to 400 mg l did not result in a significant increase in the cd ii removal efficiency when comparing fig 2 b and fig 2 c it can be seen that the trend of variation in cd ii effluent concentrations were highly correlated with the trend of mn ii concentrations variation this phenomenon is due to the removal of cd ii by adsorption to biological manganese oxide where an increase in biological mno2 production would result in an improved cd ii removal efficiency nielsen et al 2018 overall these findings indicate that ppy fe3o4 pva is a powerful biomaterial which can effectively enhance the efficiency of denitrification and improve the efficiency of mn ii and cd ii removal in bioreactor systems when the concentration of ppy fe3o4 pva was 300 mg l the combined efficiency of nitrate mn ii and cd ii removal was at the maximum observed level as a result ppy fe3o4 pva concentrations of 300 mg l were applied in all following experiments 3 3 regenerative capacity of ppy fe3o4 pva the reusability of an adsorbent is one of the most important performance aspects that must be evaluated for a new material prior to practical application lv et al 2016 in order to research the stability and regenerative capacity of ppy fe3o4 pva the material was reused for 10 consecutive cycles under the previously established optimum conditions cd ii concentration of 10 mg l mn ii concentration of 50 mg l temperature of 30 c the relationship between nitrate mn ii and cd ii removal efficiencies and the number of cycles of reuse are presented in fig 3 with increasing numbers of material reuse cycles the nitrate removal ratio did not decrease and remained stable at nearly 100 while the increase in material reuse cycles did not significantly affect nitrate removal it had a greater effect on the mn ii and cd ii oxidation ratio the mn ii oxidation ratio decreased from 94 16 to 74 60 after ten cycles of reuse remaining above 90 in the first four cycles the cd ii removal ratio also decreased with the increase of the number of material cycles when the number of material cycles increased to ten the removal ratio of cd ii reduced from 98 30 to 89 53 fig 1 c e showed the ppy fe3o4 pva material sem images after reuse for one cycle five cycles and ten cycles it can be seen that some of the ppy fe3o4 loaded on the surface of pva was lost due to repetitive scouring in the regeneration process weakening bacterial immobilization while the cd ii removal ratio in the first six cycles remained above 97 overall the mn ii oxidation ratio and cd ii removal ratio after ten cycles of ppy fe3o4 pva reuse remained higher than in the absence of ppy fe3o4 pva these results indicate that ppy fe3o4 pva has excellent stability and reusability as a bacterial fixation material 3 4 simultaneous nitrate mn ii and cd ii removal performance of the ppy fe3o4 pva biofilm reactor the denitrification mn ii and cd ii removal performance of the ppy fe3o4 pva immobilized bacteria biofilm reactor is shown in fig 4 fifteen experimental periods with varying hrt conditions and concentrations of mn ii and cd ii were used to compare the simultaneous nitrate cd ii and mn ii removal efficiency 3 4 1 effect of hydraulic retention time hrt on bioreactor performance in the initial three operational periods the influent cd ii concentration was set at 10 mg l and the influent mn ii concentration was at 20 mg l while the hrt was increased from 6 h to 10 h in the first three periods to assess the optimal hrt of the bioreactor fig 4 a shows that with a gradual increase in the hrt the nitrate concentration in effluent significantly decreased and the denitrification efficiency increased from 57 11 to 74 30 this result indicates that a higher hrt has a positive impact on the denitrification process which could be linked to variations in bacterial community development under different hrts rodriguezsanchez et al 2018 under longer hrt conditions bacteria could have sufficient time to achieve high microbial activity and nitrate removal efficiency at the same time it was observed that nitrite accumulation occurred when the hrt was 6 h and the highest level of accumulation reached 1 64 mg l while the concentration of nitrite declined with an increase in hrt from 6 h to 10 h nitrite accumulation disappeared when the hrt was 10 h this suggests that the bacteria have achieved complete denitrification guo et al 2016 also reported that sufficient contact time with denitrifying bacteria can achieve complete nitrate reduction in contaminated water in addition the mn ii removal ratio increased from 32 10 to 52 10 and the cd ii removal rate increased from 31 43 to 54 69 fig 4 c d these results verify that longer hrt s can effectively improve the simultaneous mn ii and cd ii removal efficiencies the same results were also observed from period 6 to 8 and from period 11 to 13 at which point the hrt was changed from 6 to 8 h under different cd ii concentrations therefore 10 h was selected as the optimal hrt for simultaneous nitrate mn ii and cd ii removal in subsequent bioreactor experiments 3 4 2 effect of initial mn ii concentration on bioreactor performance from period 3 to period 5 the initial concentration of mn ii increased from 20 mg l to 60 mg l the hrt conditions and cd ii concentration did not change from period 3 to period 5 it can be seen from fig 4 a that the effluent nitrate concentration reduced distinctly when the initial mn ii concentration changed from 20 mg l to 40 mg l the nitrate removal ratio remained at 100 with a denitrification rate of 1 665 mg l 1 h 1 when the initial mn ii concentration was 40 mg l meanwhile nitrite accumulation disappeared rapidly although some accumulation appeared in the initial stage of period 4 fig 4 b all these trends could be due to manganese divalent ion and sodium acetate participating in the process of mixotrophic denitrification as mixed electron donors when the initial mn ii concentration increased bacteria gained more inorganic electron donors for denitrification allowing nitrate to be removed more effectively in addition the effect of mn ii concentration on cd ii removal efficiency was observed further supporting the results of previous study showing that the cd ii removal efficiency of biofilm reactors are closely associated with the adsorption capability of biogenic manganese oxides the results presented in fig 4 c show that mn ii oxidation efficiency rapidly increased to 91 16 3 597 mg l 1 h 1 when the initial mn ii concentration increased to 40 mg l period 4 this may due to denitrifying bacteria achieving better activity when the mn ii concentration was 40 mg l as mn ii can be used as an electron donor during the denitrification process resulting in an increased manganese oxidation ratio it is of note that the cd ii concentration in effluent significantly decreased and the cd ii removal ratio reached 96 19 0 915 mg l 1 h 1 when the initial mn ii concentration increased to 40 mg l this phenomenon may because compared with synthetic δ mno2 and commercially available mn oxides biogenic mn oxides usually have higher specific surface areas that provide more cd ii adsorption sites zhang et al 2002 in addition biogenic mn oxides have been shown to have more binding energy per unit surface area miyata et al 2007 furthermore the process of denitrification could cause the ph to rise increasing the number of negatively charged sites on the surface of manganese oxides therefore cd ii adsorption occurred due to cation exchange or complexation at surface sites su et al 2019a however as the mn ii concentration increased to 60 mg l period 5 the nitrate removal ratio reduced to 81 39 with a lower removal rate of 1 307 mg l 1 h 1 at the same time nitrite accumulation was higher and the rate of nitrite removal was slower than in period 4 this suggests that when the concentration of mn ii continually increased excessively high concentrations of mn ii may inhibit bacterial activity which may be due to excessive mn ii concentrations disrupting the reactive oxygen metabolic balance in the system zhang et al 2019b in addition the presence of high metal ion concentrations would damage the microbial enzyme conformation and block essential functional groups liu et al 2018 this may account for the decline in mn ii oxidation efficiency to 73 71 and the cd ii removal ratio to 76 79 due to the toxic effect of high mn ii concentrations on bacteria the same phenomenon was also observed from period 8 to 10 and from period 14 to 15 at which point mn ii concentrations ranged from 20 to 60 mg l under different cd ii concentrations therefore the optimum mn ii concentration for simultaneous removal of nitrate mn ii and cd ii was established as 40 mg l 3 4 3 effect of initial cd ii concentration on bioreactor performance to measure the effect of cd ii concentration on the performance of the ppy fe3o4 pva biofilm reactor periods 4 9 and 14 were compared periods 4 9 and 14 all had an hrt of 10 h and an initial mn ii concentration of 40 mg l with initial cd ii concentrations of 10 20 and 30 mg l respectively as illustrated in fig 4 the nitrate concentration in effluent increased as the cd ii concentration changed from 10 mg l to 30 mg l and the denitrification efficiency decreased from 100 1 665 mg l 1 h 1 to 84 81 1 395 mg l 1 h 1 in addition the mn ii oxidation efficiency declined from 91 16 3 597 mg l 1 h 1 to 65 39 2 565 mg l 1 h 1 results show that an increase in initial cd ii concentration resulted in a negative effect on the denitrification and manganese oxidation rates meanwhile nitrite accumulation increased and the nitrite removal rate was reduced as the cd ii concentration changed from 10 mg l to 30 mg l this effect may be due to cd ii destroying the integrity of the cytomembrane and inhibiting the process of nitrate and nitrite reduction li et al 2018 previous studies have reported the same results showing that compared to the nitrate removal efficiencies obtained without metals the addition of heavy metals at a concentration of 40 mg l resulted in 3 fold lower nitrate removal efficiencies kiskira et al 2018 in addition the effect of initial mn ii concentrations on the resistance of the bioreactor to cd ii was assessed when the influent mn ii concentration was 20 mg l and the cd ii concentration increased from 10 mg l in period 3 to 20 mg l in period 8 and 30 mg l in period 13 the nitrate removal ratio reduced by 14 00 from period 3 to 8 and by 27 07 from period 8 to 13 when the influent mn ii concentration increased to 40 mg l periods 4 9 and 14 the nitrate removal ratio decreased by 3 61 from period 4 to 9 and by 15 19 from period 9 to 14 when the influent mn ii concentration was 60 mg l periods 5 10 and 15 the nitrate removal ratio decreased by 7 50 from period 5 to 10 and by 21 40 from period 10 to 15 this phenomenon shows that the bioreactor had the lowest resistance to cd ii at an initial mn ii concentration of 20 mg l however increased mn ii concentrations enhanced the resistance of the reactor to cd ii toxicity with the strongest resistance obtained when the initial mn ii concentration was 40 mg l this suggests that mn ii may play a significant role in microbial resistance to cd ii toxicity enhancing microbial catabolic activity as an available electron donor nevertheless continual increase of manganese concentrations to 60 mg l would inhibit bacterial growth thereby reducing the reactors resistance to cd ii toxicity 3 5 detection of gaseous nitrogen compounds to further investigate the nitrogen removal mechanism of the ppy fe3o4 pva bioreactor an experiment with an hrt of 10 h mn ii concentration of 40 mg l and cd ii concentration of 10 mg l same as period 4 was undertaken to assess the gas product gas chromatography gc was used to measure the composition of the gas product in the reactor fig 5 shows that 99 15 of nitrogen and 0 08 of carbon dioxide were detected while no n2o was detected in the bioreactor gas product this indicates that n2 was the main end product in the denitrification process which is in accordance with the results reported by itokawa et al 2001 carbon dioxide is a metabolic by product which produces the energy required for an organisms growth and reproduction in this study the ratio of co2 in gaseous product emissions was consistently at a low level of 0 08 this may be due to a lower carbon load under mixotrophic conditions resulting in less co2 emissions ren et al 2015 moreover the denitrification process produced alkalinity which may result in partial co2 conversion to hco3 and co3 2 and lead to a decrease in co2 emissions chen et al 2019 n2o is an intermediate in the denitrification process and has been reported as a greenhouses gas which threaten the ozone layer of the twenty first century yao et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 therefore no n2o detection in the gas product suggests that denitrification was performed completely in the ppy fe3o4 pva biofilm reactor and that this system would not induce adverse environmental effects 3 6 bacterial community diversity analysis fig 6 shows the change in microbial community structure and composition under different cd ii concentrations sample y0 was taken from the control reactor no bacteria added in period 4 and was assessed as a control samples y1 y2 and y3 were collected from experimental groups y1 from period 4 hrt of 10 h influent mn ii of 40 mg l and influent cd ii of 10 mg l y2 from period 9 hrt of 10 h influent mn ii of 40 mg l and influent cd ii of 20 mg l and y3 from period 14 hrt of 10 h influent mn ii of 40 mg l and influent cd ii of 30 mg l as shown in fig 6 a the main phyla categories of the four samples included proteobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and actinobacteria it was observed that proteobacteria had the highest proportion in all samples assessed the abundance of proteobacteria in the four samples were 38 43 in y0 87 57 in y1 75 50 in y2 and 64 33 in y3 according to previous studies strain h117 belongs to proteobacteria phyla which may play a dominant role in the denitrifying microbial community this is in accordance with the reported results of karanasios et al 2010 that most denitrifying bacteria belong to proteobacteria in addition these results indicate that with the increase in initial cd ii concentration the growth of proteobacteria were inhibited while other phyla showed irregular changes the denitrification efficiency mn ii oxidation efficiency and cd ii removal rate decreased gradually with increasing cd ii concentrations as discussed in section 3 4 therefore a correlation was observed between microbial community changes in proteobacteria phyla and the nitrate mn ii and cd ii removal performance this indicates that the immobilized pseudomonas sp h117 in the reactor may play a significant role in microbial community structure and the removal of nitrate mn ii and cd ii from the bioreactor fig 6 b presents microbial community dynamics at the class level gammaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria sphingobacteria bacilli and alphaproteobacteria were identified as the main classes in samples y1 y2 and y3 it has been reported that gammaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria sphingobacteriia and bacilli play a key role in denitrifying systems wang et al 2018b gammaproteobacteria were the dominate class in samples y1 y2 and y3 with the increase in initial cd ii concentration gammaproteobacteria dramatically decreased in abundance from 76 81 to 42 07 although they remained dominant in the reactor this may due to cd ii inhibiting the growth and reproduction of gammaproteobacteria compared with the bioreactor performance in section 3 4 the microbial community change of class gammaproteobacteria was highly correlated with the denitrification mn ii and cd ii removal efficiencies in the bioreactor which both presented a downward trend with initial cd ii concentrations from 10 mg l to 30 mg l as previously reported su et al 2019b the target bacteria h117 immobilized in the reactor belongs to gammaproteobacteria therefore gammaproteobacteria h117 plays an important role in the simultaneous denitrification mn ii and cd ii removal in the reactor in addition the class betaproteobacteria increased from 13 28 to 21 81 and sphingobacteriia and bacilli also increased slightly at the same time these results suggest that these classes may be more competitive in heavy metal containing environments which corresponds with previously reported research qian et al 2017 to further investigate the similarities and differences among samples bacterial communities were evaluated at the genus level by heatmap as shown in fig 6 c 50 species were identified at the genus level in samples y0 y1 y2 and y3 results showed that pseudomonas was detected in all samples and accounted for the highest proportion in samples y1 y2 and y3 the relative abundance of pseudomonas in samples y1 y2 and y3 were 20 22 16 21 and 11 13 respectively the abundance of pseudomonas decreased with increasing cd ii concentrations from 10 mg l to 30 mg l which indicates that higher concentrations of cd ii increased toxicity in the reactor and inhibited the enrichment of pseudomonas and the performance of denitrification mn ii and cd ii removal 4 conclusion this study developed an efficient simultaneous denitrification mn ii and cd ii removal ppy fe3o4 pva bioreactor morphological analysis demonstrated that ppy fe3o4 pva has a well developed porous structures and rough surface for bacterial immobilization according to the batch tests results the optimal concentration of ppy fe3o4 pva was 300 mg l in addition the ppy fe3o4 pva material retained high removal efficiency after 10 cycles of regeneration and reuse during operation the reactor achieved a maximum denitrification efficiency of 100 1 665 mg l 1 h 1 with mn ii and cd ii removal efficiencies of 91 16 3 597 mg l 1 h 1 and 96 19 0 915 mg l 1 h 1 achieved at an hrt of 10 h initial mn ii concentration of 40 mg l and initial cd ii concentration of 10 mg l analysis of gaseous nitrogen compounds confirmed that n2 was the gaseous end product during reactor operation moreover pseudomonas was found to provide the dominant contribution to the activity of the ppy fe3o4 pva bioreactor and high concentrations of heavy metals inhibited the growth and metabolism of pseudomonas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

18401,a variety of fluorinated alternatives are being manufactured and applied as a consequence of stringent regulations on legacy poly perfluoroalkyl substances pfass in this study 26 emerging and legacy pfass were measured in the surface water including dissolved phase and suspended particulate matter and sediments taken from hai river basin china the total concentrations of pfass pfass ranged from 1 74 to 172 ng l with perfluorooctanonate pfoa as the dominant compound 15 2 of the pfass median value emerging pfass such as dimer acid of hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid hfpo da and trimer acid hfpo ta were widely detected in the water samples specifically chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate f 53b was observed to be predominant in some sediment samples a receptor model unmix was introduced to identify the sources of pfass in the surface water and the results indicated that fire fighting foam fluoropolymer processing aids 36 6 were the dominant source the field based sediment water organic carbon normalized coefficients k oc were correlated to the carbon chain lengths of the pfass a technique coupling one way analysis of variance with chemical mass balance model was developed to trace the manufacturing sources of pfoa electrochemical fluorination ecf was the major pfoa manufacturing source with considerable contribution by telomerization for the first time the isomers of perfluorooctane sulfonamide pfosa were quantified in the environmental samples the lower proportion of branched br pfosa isomers and higher percentage of br perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos isomers in the water samples relative to their corresponding commercial products provided more direct evidences that br pfosa isomers were biotransformed more easily than n pfosa explaining the observed enrichment of br pfos in the aquatic environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords poly perfluoroalkyl substances receptor model distribution behavior isomers chemical balance model 1 introduction in the past six decades per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass have been used extensively in many industrial products including textile coatings surfactants pesticide formulas food contact materials and fire fighting foams buck et al 2011 calafat et al 2007 because of the unique physical and chemical stability pfass are resistant to degradation and broadly distributed in the environment extensive studies document that several pfass such as perfluorooctanonate pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos may cause potential adverse effects on human health including decreased neonatal weight and increased incidences of liver pancreas and testicular tumors biegel et al 2001 cook et al 1992 grice et al 2007 concerns about the persistence and toxicities drove government agencies and organizations to regulate or limit the production and emission of these traditional pfas compounds including pfos and related salts posf pfoa as well as the long chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas echa european chemicals agency 2015 unep united nations environment programme the large market demand inevitably prompted the development and trade of many poly or perfluorinated alternatives for example hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid hfpo da with the trade name genx has been widely used in fluoropolymer manufactures as an alternative of pfoa leading to its frequent detection in the environment heydebreck et al 2015 sun et al 2016 its concentration in the surface water was 0 73 ng l in yangtze river and 14 ng l in tai lake pan et al 2018 and a surprisingly high level up to 9350 ng l was observed in a river downstream the largest fluoropolymer factory in china pan et al 2017 song et al 2018 as an alternative to pfos 6 2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate f 53b 6 2 cl pfesa has been applied as a mist suppressant in china for decades wang et al 2013a recent monitoring studies reported that the level of f 53b up to 78 5 ng l was similar to pfos in certain river water samples in china wang et al 2016b as alternatives of pfos and pfoa a couple of short chain pfass are being widely used and their concentrations were reported to exceed pfos pfoa in some places nguyen et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 zhou et al 2013 cyclic perfluorinated sulfonic acids such as perfluoroethylenecyclohexanesulfonate pfechs used as erosion inhibitors in aircraft were detected in an airport impacted ecosystem wang et al 2016c 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonate 6 2 fts as an alternative to pfos in fire fighting foam was also detected in an urban watershed nguyen et al 2011 these replacing actions would lead to diversified and complicated sources and compositions of pfass in the environment thus source apportionment is very important to identify the sources of pfass in the environment for effective pollution control to date there are sporadic studies on source apportionment of pfass in the environment and most of them were based on ratio methods correlation analysis and principal component analysis xiao et al 2012 young et al 2007 these methods provided qualitative information on the sources but few with quantitative analysis henry 2003 zhang et al 2012 qi et al 2017 employed three receptor models principal component analysis multiple linear regression positive matrix factorization and unmix model to identify the emission sources of 12 traditional pfass in tai lake china which did not take the emerging pfas alternatives into consideration liu et al 2019 used positive matrix factorization for source apportionment of pfass in bohai bay china five sources were identified but the contribution of each source was not quantified unmix based on factor analysis has been widely used as a receptor model for quantitative source apportionment in sediments surface water and atmosphere huang et al 2010 maykut et al 2003 yu et al 2006 zhang et al 2012 the most important algorithm implemented in unmix is to find the edges in the space composed of n independent elements characteristic of a variety of sources henry 2003 larsen and baker 2003 thus unmix model could provide a novel method for quantitative identification of the multiple sources of pfass in aquatic environment although pfoa manufacturing is regulated in european countries and america they are still manufactured in china in two typical manufacturing techniques namely electrochemical fluorination ecf and telomerization benskin et al 2010 jin et al 2015 benskin et al 2010 developed a method to estimate the contributions of ecf and telomerization based on statistical analysis and the ratios of specific isomers the contribution of ecf product was derived from a calibration curve based on the standards of ecf product and linear pfoa n pfoa which was only effective in a narrow concentration range based on the law of conservation of mass chemical mass balance cmb model looks for the best linear fit of the chemical compositions released from multiple sources with fixed fingerprints to reconstruct the chemical compositions in the environmental samples zheng et al 2002 considering that the isomeric fingerprints of the commercial pfoa products are relatively consistent benskin et al 2010 cmb model could quantitatively assess the contributions of pfoa manufacturing sources for pfos ecf was the primary manufacturing technique and enrichment of branched br pfos isomers in water phase was observed which was proposed to be due to preferential biotransformation of br isomers of the pfos precursors in aquatic environment benskin et al 2010 yu et al 2013 however there was no direct evidence to support this assumption mostly due to the lack of quantitative analytical methods for measuring the isomers of pfos precursors such as perfluorooctane sulfonamide pfosa in the environment recently our group developed an analytical method for identification and quantification of pfosa isomers in complicated matrices shan et al 2019 which provides a useful measure to quantify their isomers in real environmental samples in this study raw samples including surface waters n 40 suspended particulate matters spm n 39 and sediments n 20 were collected in hai river basin 8 rivers and 3 reservoirs many of the rivers flow through industrial areas such as steel plants chemical plants refiners and megacities twenty six emerging and legacy pfass were measured in these samples a receptor model unmix was introduced to apportion the sources of emerging and legacy pfass and an algorithm coupled one way anova with cmb model was developed for tracing the manufacturing sources of pfoa the partitioning behaviors of novel alternatives between sediment and water were compared with those of legacy pfass by calculating the empirical k oc values for the first time the isomeric compositions of pfosa in natural surface water were measured and the difference in the isomeric profiles between the real samples and ecf standards was compared to give clues on enrichment of br pfos in surface water the results of this study provide novel insights into elucidating the spatial distribution and complicated sources of pfass in complex river systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection the sampling campaign took place in hai river basin in october 2017 at the sampling sites selected according to the guidelines of national environmental monitoring program of china as shown in fig 1 the sampling sites were located in 8 rivers and 3 reservoirs detailed information of each site is listed in table s1 forty surface water samples and 20 sediments were collected five liters of surface water were collected from each site and filtered through a glass fiber filter 142 mm pore diameter 0 7 μm millipore corp usa to obtain suspended particulate matter spm the filtered water was stored in high density polyethylene bottle previously rinsed with methanol followed by ultrapure water while the spm was freeze dried and weighted one kg of sediment was collected using a hand piston sediment sampler and stored in low density polyethylene bags at 4 c the detailed sampling information is described in si 2 2 chemicals and solvents the following substances were monitored in the samples pfcas c4 c14 perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas c4 c10 even pfosa cl pfesas 6 2 and 8 2 fts 4 2 6 2 and 8 2 ammonium 4 8 dioxa 3h perfluorononanoate adona 6 2 dipap hfpo da hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid hfpo ta pfechs most of the native and mass labeled reference standards were purchased from wellington laboratories guelph canada except hfpo ta which was obtained from fluorochem old glossop uk the molecular formula and chemical structures of the pfass and reagents used in this study are all supplied in si 2 3 sample extraction and instrumental analysis the target pfass in the dissolved phase of surface water were extracted by solid phase extraction using a cartridge cleanert pep 500 mg 6 ml agela technology china the sediment and spm samples were extracted by ultrasonication with methanol and followed by purification with cleanert pep cartridges the details about the extraction and purification spm and in sediment are provided in si the target pfass were analyzed on an acquity uplc coupled to a xevo tq s triple quadrupole mass spectrometer waters milford ma usa the isomers of pfos pfoa and pfosa were separated and quantified by uplc ms ms electrospray ionization in negative mode with a fluorosep rp octyl column the information about lc ms ms operation conditions and quality control is provided in si the optimized parameters of lc ms ms are supplied in table s2 and the method detection limits mdls and recoveries of each pfas are provided in table s3 the details of the method for separating pfosa isomers are provided in a previous study shan et al 2019 2 4 quality assurance and quality control all pretreatment procedures were conducted in a clean laboratory at nankai university triplicate recovery experiments were performed by spiking a certain amount of pfas standards in the dissolved water phase spm and sediment samples separately a six point calibration curve of each pfas was prepared for quantification r2 0 99 the isomers of pfoa and pfos were quantified using the characterized technical pfoa t pfoa and br pfosk standards obtained from wellington pfosa isomers were quantified with the characterized pfosa standards in a previous study shan et al 2019 the recoveries of all the target pfass were in the range of 65 7 129 73 5 119 and 59 8 137 in the dissolved water phase spm and sediment samples respectively si table s3 the method detection limits mdls were defined as the concentrations with a signal to noise ratio of three plus three times the standard deviations of the blank responses a procedural blank was set up with each batch of 12 samples no detectable contamination was found for most pfass except for low levels of pfoa and pfhxs perfluorohexane sulfonate and pfos the blank levels of these compounds were subtracted from the accompanied batch samples 2 5 statistical analyses the field based sediment or spm dissolved water distribution coefficient of pfass k d cm3 g was calculated using the following equation 1 k d c s c w cs is the concentration of individual pfas ng g dw in solid phase sediment or spm while cw is the concentration in dissolved water collected from the same site the organic carbon normalized sediment water distribution coefficients k oc cm3 g of pfass was derived from the k d value using the following equation 2 k o c 100 k d f o c f oc is the percentage of organic carbon in sediment or spm samples si table s4 the details for the determination of organic carbon is described in si one way analysis of variance anova was applied to compare pfoa isomer profiles between the samples and ecf standard and compare the log k oc values of different pfass all statistical analyses were performed with ibm spss statistics 21 the concentrations below mdl were set as half of the mdl for statistical purposes 2 6 unmix model epa unmix 6 0 was used in this study unmix assumes that the compositions and contributions of the pollution sources are positive by analyzing the concentration data of given species unmix estimates the number of sources source compositions and source contributions at each sampling site considering that accurate information is needed for the source apportionment the pfass with low detection frequencies 50 and fitting coefficients r2 0 3 were excluded from the model the species with high variance 50 were also suggested to be excluded by unmix model qi et al 2017 twelve pfass in surface water including dissolved phase and spm phase were selected for identification of the sources by unmix model c4 11 pfcas pfhxs 6 2 fts 6 2 cl pfesa and hfpo da unmix aims to reduce the normalized source profiles by projecting 13 40 dataset including σ21pfass to a plane perpendicular to the first axis of a space composed of n independent elements and the normalized contributions of each source could be predicted in the edges of the projected data pfos and pfosa were excluded from this model because their fitting results were poor r2 0 3 this might be because that pfosa could transform to pfoa in aquatic environment the sources were identified by characteristic compounds with significant uses for example 6 2 cl pfesa f 53b has been applied as a mist suppressant in metal plating industries for decades in china and it was then selected as the marker of metal plating source wang et al 2013a the characteristic pfass in each source were identified by unmix fig s2 the minimum r2 of the result was 0 70 while the minimum s n was 2 60 the signal to noise ratio was calculated as described by henry et al 1999 by numfact the predicted results were calculated by adding the measured concentrations and residuals calculated by unmix the details of the algorithms can be found in the references henry 1997 2003 weighted linear regression was used to fit the predicted and observed concentrations of total pfass the regression equation is y 1 06x 0 174 r2 0 936 2 7 cmb model to apply cmb model several assumptions need to be satisfied 1 the compositions of the source should be fixed over the period of sampling 2 the pfass should not react with each other 3 all sources should be identified and have their specific profiles 4 the different sources should be linear to each other 5 uncertainties of the measurements should be random uncorrelated and normally distributed an et al 2003 the above assumptions were satisfied for identification of pfoa manufacturing sources the fingerprints are generally consistent ecf 77 3 linear and 22 6 branched jiang et al 2015 linear telomer 100 linear and isopropyl telomer 100 iso pfoa it is assumed that other manufacturing sources were negligible because of their minor production volume benskin et al 2009 nkcmb 2 0 which is the chinese version of epa cmb 8 2 and was developed by nankai university china was used for tracing pfoa manufacturing source further details and information can be found in the references an et al 2003 li et al 2001 one way anova following the benskin s method was conducted to identify the potential manufacturing sources benskin et al 2010 then the cmb model was used for calculating the contributions of the individual sources 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of pfass in the surface water and sediment twenty six emerging and legacy pfass were analyzed in the surface water including dissolved phase and particle phase and sediment samples from hai river basin the levels of pfass in each sample are listed in tables s5 7 the levels of pfass in the surface water including dissolved phase and particle phase are shown in fig 2 8 2 cl pfesa adona pfds perfluorodecane sulfonate pftrda perfluorotridecanoate and pfteda perfluorotetradecanoate were not detected in any of the water samples the total concentrations of other pfass σ21pfass were in the range of 1 74 172 ng l with the mean and median levels as 26 6 and 19 9 ng l respectively which was similar to the results reported in other 18 chinese rivers 16 3 ng l median wang et al 2016b pfoa 0 279 22 6 ng l was predominant with an average contribution of 17 7 in the σ21pfass pfoa concentration was comparable to that at the mouth of hai river pfoa 20 ng l reported previously wang et al 2016b in 2008 pfoa was listed on the catalogue of high pollution high environmental risk chemicals by ministry of ecological environment of china meec ministry of ecological environment of china 2008 and was listed in the candidate catalogue of stockholm convention in 2015 unep united nations environment programme 2015 pfos and pfosf were included in the stockholm convention in 2009 unep united nations environment programme it was worth noting that the c4 7 pfcas accounted for a large proportion 45 mean value of the σ21pfass meaning that short chain pfass are replacing pfoa and other longer chain pfcas ritter 2010 wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 zhou et al 2013 some emerging pfass were detected in most of the water samples the detection frequencies of hfpo da 0 316 ng l mean value hfpo ta 1 00 ng l and 6 2 cl pfesa 0 335 ng l were 82 5 100 and 95 0 respectively this indicated that these emerging pfass are being used widely in the hai river basin as substituents for the legacy pfass fig s1 shows the concentrations and profiles of pfass in the sediment samples of hai river basin the detection frequencies of perfluorobutanoate pfba pfhxs and pfteda were 30 different from the water samples c9 12 pfcas 0 172 ng l mean value accounted for a dominating proportion 17 2 mean value in the sediments a couple of long chain pfass 8 2 cl pfesa pfds and pfdoa were detected in 80 of the sediment samples but they were not detected in any surface water samples this suggests that long chain pfass were more inclined to partition to sediment than the short chain ones zhao et al 2012 it is interesting that the level of hfpo ta in the sediment was comparable to those of c9 12 pfcas which provided another evidence that hfpo oligomers are being applied widely 3 2 spatial distribution and source apportionment of pfass in hai river basin fig 2 indicates that the levels of pfass in surface water at the sites close to the reservoirs including erwangzhuang reservoir er yuqiao reservoir yr and miyun reservoir mr except for mr1 and mr4 were significantly lower than the river sites p 0 05 this suggested that the drinking water source areas in hai river basin are generally well protected although mr1 and mr4 are close and originated from the miyun reservoir they run through miyun industrial park beijing the discharge from the industrial park may be responsible for the higher σ21pfass at these two sites the σ21pfass in the surface water samples ranged from 1 74 ng l at yuqiao reservoir yr6 to 172 ng l at ziya river z2 both the concentrations and dominant congeners varied greatly among the sites which is understandable since the sampling campaign covered rural and urban areas with different industrial characteristics within a range of 170 km there are a couples of previous studies reporting the occurrence of pfass in hai river since the stockholm convention in 2009 li et al 2011 meng et al 2017 pan et al 2011 wang et al 2016b zhao et al 2016 in all of these studies pfoa 5 20 ng l was the dominant pfas compound in the surface water the aqueous concentration of pfos was below 10 ng l while it was predominant in the sediment and the short chain pfcas were detected with concentrations slightly lower than pfoa these results indicated that the concentrations of pfass in hai river were relatively stable and the results obtained in this study were suitable for the source apportionment of pfass in this basin it is difficult to identify the emission sources in this large river system by ratio method and correlation analysis therefore a receptor model unmix was utilized to identify the sources and their specific contributions for pfass in hai river basin four sources were identified by unmix model and fig 3 a illustrates that the predicted and observed values of σ21pfass were in a good correlation r2 0 936 p 0 001 source 1 was dominated by pfoa and perfluorononanoate pfna while 6 2 cl pfesa was also distinct in this source table s8 pfoa and pfna are widely used in the production of fluororesin coatings which are applied further in metal plating industries qi et al 2017 therefore source 1 was identified as the source of fluororesin coatings metal plating source 2 was characterized by the high percentage of pfhxs which is extensively used as a surfactant to produce fluoropolymers or a protective agent in papers and textiles ntc national toxicology program 2012 lee and viberg 2013 kim et al 2018 thus source 2 was representative of surfactants protective agents 6 2 fts pfba and hfpo da were the main components of source 3 pfba and hfpo da are substitutes of pfoa and widely used in many fluoropolymer production as processing aids heydebreck et al 2015 wang et al 2013b 2016a since 6 2 fts is frequently detected in surface water contaminated by fire fighting foam and it was reported to be the dominant pfas in current afff produced in china mumtaz et al 2019 d agostino and mabury 2017 jin et al 2017 nguyen et al 2011 it was assumed to be the characteristic pfas in the afff products thus source 3 was identified as firefighting foam fluoropolymer processing aids source 4 was distinguished due to the high load of perfluoropentanoate pfpea perfluoroundecanoate pfuda and perfludecanoate pfda pfuda and pfda were selected as the markers because of their specific application in textile treatments cai et al 2012 as a short chain pfca pfpea is widely used in fast food packages zafeiraki et al 2014 accordingly source 4 was regarded as textile treatments food packages taking hai river basin as a whole fig 3b indicates that source 3 i e fire fighting foam fluoropolymer processing aids 36 6 and source 1 metal plating fluororesin coatings 33 7 were the major sources of pfass which were followed by source 4 textile treatments food packages 17 7 and source 2 surfactants protective agents 12 0 the contribution of each source to the total load of pfass varied a lot among the rivers and reservoirs source 4 textile treatments food packages was the major emission source of pfass in beipai river b and chaobai river cb canglang river cl and duliuxian river d were dominated by source 1 fluororesin coatings metal plating the source contributions in jiyun river j and miyun reservior were relatively equal and source 1 and 4 were the main sources whereas the source contributions changed greatly in hai river and yongding river y indicating that multiple sources existed in these two rivers the especially high contribution of one specific source at certain sites implied there were specific point sources near the sites for instance the major source at the sites such as d2 and y1 fig 3c was predominantly contributed by source 1 fluororesin coatings metal plating 67 0 and 72 1 respectively there is a resin coating plant in the upper reach of d2 and two metal plating factories in the upstream of y1 which may explain the high contribution of source 1 at these two sites source 2 surfactants protective agents was not significant at most sites except for z1 and z2 dagang oilfield tianjin is in the north and two petroleum adjuvants factories which used a large amount of surfactants are within 3 km of z1 and z2 source 3 firefighting foam fluoropolymer processing aids was observed at all sites and higher contribution was found at sites of hai river h3 h4 and yongding river y2 the emission source at h3 and h4 might be a fire extinguisher factory and langfang airport located at the upstream of y2 source 4 accounted for the largest proportion at sites b2 and b3 a paper industrial park is located in the middle of b2 and b3 and a factory of packaging products is close to b3 these factories may be responsible for the pfass pollution caused by food packages some precursors such as paps and telomer based products could transform into pfcas through microbial degradation or photolysis holly et al 2010 houtz et al 2013 liu and mejia avendano 2013 however the transformation rate e g 6 2 fts was relatively low in the environment yin et al 2019 thus the contribution due to transformation is supposed to be low 3 3 isomeric profiles and manufacturing origins of pfoa the isomer profiles of pfoa in surface water samples including dissolved phase and spm phase are illustrated in fig 4 a the samples with the concentrations of two and more isomers below the mdls were excluded to reduce interference linear n pfoa was the predominant pfoa isomer with an average proportion of 82 6 5 31 the branched isomers were on the order of iso pfoa 8 34 2 71 4m pfoa 4 54 1 55 5m pfoa 4 49 1 38 which was similar to that in the ecf commercial product but the profiles of individual isomers in each river differed with a large variation ecf and n telomerization are the two primary manufacturing methods to produce pfoa while iso telomerization also exists in asia benskin et al 2010 therefore a source apportionment is meaningful for tracing the manufacturing sources of pfoa a receptor model chemical mass balance cmb was introduced to quantitatively assess the contributions of the three manufacturing sources the sites with the highest pfoa concentration b1 cb4 cl2 d2 h7 j4 y1 and z1 in each river were selected to run the model because these sites were most probably closest to the point sources the ecf reference standard utilized in this study has been reported in a previous study jiang et al 2015 the ratios iso n 4m n and 5m n at b1 cb4 d2 and j4 were not statistically different from those in the ecf standards p 0 05 this suggested that ecf was probably the predominant manufacturing source of pfoa in these rivers if a significant difference was observed an additional anova was performed on 5m iso and 4m iso values there was significant difference in these two ratios for site h7 this suggested that n telomerization and ecf were the two manufacturing sources in hai river thus ecf and n telomerization were selected as the sources of h7 in cmb model table 1 shows the cmb modeling results which indicated that ecf contributed 69 2 of total pfoa while 30 8 was resulted from n telomerization the third anova on 4m 5m was performed if significant difference was still observed when the ratio of 4m 5m was not statistically different from the ecf standard additional contribution from iso telomerization was potential manufacturing source which was observed at that sites of cl2 and z1 the contribution of iso telomerization source was 2 84 and 1 48 at cl2 and z1 respectively the ratios of 4m n 4m iso and 4m 5 m at y1 were significantly higher than those of the ecf standard indicating that specific manufacturing sources for 4m pfoa or active biotransformation might exist in yongding river benskin et al 2010 the cmb model coupled with the benskin s method inferred that ecf was the primary pfoa manufacturing source followed by n telomerization whereas iso telomerization occasionally existed in a few sites in the hai river basin 3 4 isomer profiles of pfos and pfosa the profiles of individual branched pfos isomers in hai river basin are shown in fig 4b and the samples with two or more isomers below mdls were excluded m 2 and 2m pfos were not included because of their low content 0 6 in the standard and commercial products branched pfos isomers ranged from 26 9 beipai river to 48 9 duliuxian river the percentage of br pfos especially iso pfos was higher than that of ecf standard which was similar with those reported in previous studies chen et al 2015b fang et al 2014 magali et al 2008 pfos and pfosa were exclusively manufactured by ecf process it was suggested that preferential biotransformation of the branched isomers of pfos precursors such as pfosa made a great contribution to the enrichment of br pfos in aquatic environment yu et al 2013 identification of the isomers of pfosa an important pfos precursors would give a direct evidence for this hypothesis a quantitative lc ms ms method for pfosa isomers was developed by our group and was applied to analyze them in the water samples shan et al 2019 because of the relatively low concentrations of the total pfosa only one branched isomer iso pfosa was detected above the mdl in a few samples the ratio iso pfosa n pfosa was calculated for these samples and compared with that of ecf pfosa standard the ratio in the water samples 0 05 0 02 was significantly p 0 01 lower than that in ecf pfosa standard 0 14 0 01 implying that iso pfosa might be easier to biotransform than n pfosa in natural aquatic environment this result was in agreement with a previous study which reported that branched pfosa isomers were preferentially metabolized to br pfos than n pfosa in common carp chen et al 2015a the preferential biotransformation of iso pfosa could make a contribution to the enrichment of iso pfos in river ecosystems 3 5 the replacing trends of novel pfas alternatives some emerging alternatives of legacy ones including short chain perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas hfpo oligomers and f 53b were frequently detected in hai river basin the ratios r of their concentrations to those of the corresponding legacy ones were calculated to probe into the replacement occurring in the market some short chain pfass such as pfba and pfbs are considered to be sustainable alternatives to long chain pfass since they could be less bio accumulative in aquatic organisms wang et al 2016a many studies reported that pfba or pfbs became the dominant pfas compound in surface water in recent years due to the shifting of commercial products in the market of north and central china wang et al 2016a zhao et al 2016 zhou et al 2013 as shown in fig s3 the median ratios of pfba pfoa and pfbs pfos were 0 804 and 0 394 respectively the ratio of pfba pfoa in this study was comparable to that 0 697 median reported previously in 10 major watersheds in china table s10 chen et al 2018b liu et al 2015 pan et al 2014 2018 wang et al 2014 2016a 2016b zhao et al 2016 zhou et al 2013 both ratios of pfba pfoa and pfbs pfos in this study were higher than the mean values 0 355 0 130 respectively monitored in the mouth of haihe river in 2013 wang et al 2016b these results indicate that replacement with pfba and pfbs as alternatives of the legacy pfass is increasing in hai river basin since 2013 pfecas and pfesas are other two kinds of alternatives to legacy pfass hfpo oligomers hfpo da and hfpo ta are mainly used as processing aids in producing fluoropolymer products the median ratio of hfpo da pfoa was 0 0637 in hai river basin which was at a relatively low level compared with other major water systems in china 0 219 median the ratio of hfpo ta pfoa 0 244 median was higher than that of hfpo da pfoa hfpo ta has a longer carbon chain than hfpo da and is widely applied in synthesizing poly vinylidene fluoride millauer et al 2010 as a mist suppressant in metal plating industry wang et al 2013a f 53b was also widely distributed in the hai river basin however the ratio of f 53b pfos 0 105 median was relatively low compared with the major water systems in china indicating that f 53b was prevalent but not the dominant alternative in hai river basin in summary various pfas alternatives are being used as substituents of the legacy pfass in different extents in hai river basin and short chain pfass were the major alternatives 3 6 the partitioning behaviors of emerging and legacy pfass as discussed above different pfas profiles were observed in the dissolved phase and sediment which could be due to the different partitioning behaviors of pfass field based k oc values were calculated to illustrate the partitioning behaviors of the emerging and legacy pfass in aquatic environment fig 5 some pfass e g pfba pfpea pfdoa pfbs pfds their k oc values were not calculated because of their low detection frequencies in the dissolved phase spm or sediment the log k oc values ranged from 2 75 0 59 perfluorohexanoate pfhxa to 5 51 1 18 6 2 dipap displaying a general increasing trend with the carbon chain length increasing this was in accordance with that reported in previous studies chen et al 2015b 2018b the log k oc values of several novel alternatives were compared to those of pfaas with the same number of fluorinated carbons cf both hfpo da and pfhxa have five perfluorinated carbon atoms cf 5 and their log k oc values 2 85 0 61 vs 2 75 0 59 were similar p 0 05 this implied that insertion of an ether linkage did not significantly influence the partitioning behaviors of the pfass gomis et al 2015 in contrast the log k oc of f 53b 4 49 0 64 was significantly p 0 05 higher than that pfos 3 75 0 61 even they have the same number of cf the replacement of one end f by cl atom and the addition of an ether linkage result in a larger molecular size 407 91 413 61 å than pfos 381 77 å in addition the cl atom contributes to greater hydrophobicity of the fluorinated carbon chain which could explain the stronger adsorption of f 53b on solid particular phase chen et al 2018a it is worth noting that the log k oc value of hfpo ta 4 25 0 76 was obviously higher than that of pfna with the same cf which could be explained by the larger molecular size of hfpo ta containing two ether linkages previous studies reported that the log k oc of pfosa was slightly higher than that of pfos and the n alkyl substitution was responsible for the enhanced log k oc chen et al 2018b gebbink et al 2016 munoz et al 2015 in this study the log k oc of pfosa 3 59 0 56 was similar to that of pfos 3 75 0 61 which might be due to the active biotransformation of pfosa in sediment however the spm derived log k oc of pfosa 5 53 0 51 was higher than pfos 5 04 0 78 this further fortifies that pfosa could experience biotransformation by microorganisms in sediment and led to its lower sediment derived log k oc fig s4 similar with other studies spm derived log k oc of pfass were one log unit higher than the corresponding values derived from sediments but there was a very good correlation between them lutz et al 2010 shan et al 2014 usually the particles of spm are smaller than those of sediments thus spm displayed higher sorption capacity due to the large specific surface areas and more adsorption sites available for pollutant adsorption shan et al 2014 zhao et al 2012 4 conclusions the experimental results present in our study demonstrated that legacy pfass notably pfoa and novel alternatives notably short chain pfcas and f 53b were widely distributed in hai river basin the existence of emerging and legacy pfass in aquatic environment makes it hard to recognize the complicated sources for the purpose of pollution control the receptor models which have been usually applied in source apportionment of organic pollutants and particulate matters in the atmosphere larsen and baker 2003 zhang et al 2012 may provide a quantitative identification of the sources of pfass in surface river systems the results indicated that fire fighting foam fluoropolymer processing aids 36 6 were the dominant source of pfass in the hai river basin the commercial products of some pfas compounds such as pfoa pfos and pfosa have a fixed fingerprints of their isomers combing a previous developed method based on the ratios of various isomers a receptor model such as cmb could provide more accurate and quantitative information to trace pfoa manufacturing sources for the first time the isomers of pfosa were quantified in the environmental samples the shortage of iso pfosa relative to the commercial product provided further evidences that branched isomers such as iso pfosa were more easily biotransformed than n pfosa and suggested that the preferential biotransformation of branched precursors of pfos make a contribution to the enrichment of br pfos in the aquatic environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18401,a variety of fluorinated alternatives are being manufactured and applied as a consequence of stringent regulations on legacy poly perfluoroalkyl substances pfass in this study 26 emerging and legacy pfass were measured in the surface water including dissolved phase and suspended particulate matter and sediments taken from hai river basin china the total concentrations of pfass pfass ranged from 1 74 to 172 ng l with perfluorooctanonate pfoa as the dominant compound 15 2 of the pfass median value emerging pfass such as dimer acid of hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid hfpo da and trimer acid hfpo ta were widely detected in the water samples specifically chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate f 53b was observed to be predominant in some sediment samples a receptor model unmix was introduced to identify the sources of pfass in the surface water and the results indicated that fire fighting foam fluoropolymer processing aids 36 6 were the dominant source the field based sediment water organic carbon normalized coefficients k oc were correlated to the carbon chain lengths of the pfass a technique coupling one way analysis of variance with chemical mass balance model was developed to trace the manufacturing sources of pfoa electrochemical fluorination ecf was the major pfoa manufacturing source with considerable contribution by telomerization for the first time the isomers of perfluorooctane sulfonamide pfosa were quantified in the environmental samples the lower proportion of branched br pfosa isomers and higher percentage of br perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos isomers in the water samples relative to their corresponding commercial products provided more direct evidences that br pfosa isomers were biotransformed more easily than n pfosa explaining the observed enrichment of br pfos in the aquatic environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords poly perfluoroalkyl substances receptor model distribution behavior isomers chemical balance model 1 introduction in the past six decades per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass have been used extensively in many industrial products including textile coatings surfactants pesticide formulas food contact materials and fire fighting foams buck et al 2011 calafat et al 2007 because of the unique physical and chemical stability pfass are resistant to degradation and broadly distributed in the environment extensive studies document that several pfass such as perfluorooctanonate pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos may cause potential adverse effects on human health including decreased neonatal weight and increased incidences of liver pancreas and testicular tumors biegel et al 2001 cook et al 1992 grice et al 2007 concerns about the persistence and toxicities drove government agencies and organizations to regulate or limit the production and emission of these traditional pfas compounds including pfos and related salts posf pfoa as well as the long chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas echa european chemicals agency 2015 unep united nations environment programme the large market demand inevitably prompted the development and trade of many poly or perfluorinated alternatives for example hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid hfpo da with the trade name genx has been widely used in fluoropolymer manufactures as an alternative of pfoa leading to its frequent detection in the environment heydebreck et al 2015 sun et al 2016 its concentration in the surface water was 0 73 ng l in yangtze river and 14 ng l in tai lake pan et al 2018 and a surprisingly high level up to 9350 ng l was observed in a river downstream the largest fluoropolymer factory in china pan et al 2017 song et al 2018 as an alternative to pfos 6 2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate f 53b 6 2 cl pfesa has been applied as a mist suppressant in china for decades wang et al 2013a recent monitoring studies reported that the level of f 53b up to 78 5 ng l was similar to pfos in certain river water samples in china wang et al 2016b as alternatives of pfos and pfoa a couple of short chain pfass are being widely used and their concentrations were reported to exceed pfos pfoa in some places nguyen et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 zhou et al 2013 cyclic perfluorinated sulfonic acids such as perfluoroethylenecyclohexanesulfonate pfechs used as erosion inhibitors in aircraft were detected in an airport impacted ecosystem wang et al 2016c 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonate 6 2 fts as an alternative to pfos in fire fighting foam was also detected in an urban watershed nguyen et al 2011 these replacing actions would lead to diversified and complicated sources and compositions of pfass in the environment thus source apportionment is very important to identify the sources of pfass in the environment for effective pollution control to date there are sporadic studies on source apportionment of pfass in the environment and most of them were based on ratio methods correlation analysis and principal component analysis xiao et al 2012 young et al 2007 these methods provided qualitative information on the sources but few with quantitative analysis henry 2003 zhang et al 2012 qi et al 2017 employed three receptor models principal component analysis multiple linear regression positive matrix factorization and unmix model to identify the emission sources of 12 traditional pfass in tai lake china which did not take the emerging pfas alternatives into consideration liu et al 2019 used positive matrix factorization for source apportionment of pfass in bohai bay china five sources were identified but the contribution of each source was not quantified unmix based on factor analysis has been widely used as a receptor model for quantitative source apportionment in sediments surface water and atmosphere huang et al 2010 maykut et al 2003 yu et al 2006 zhang et al 2012 the most important algorithm implemented in unmix is to find the edges in the space composed of n independent elements characteristic of a variety of sources henry 2003 larsen and baker 2003 thus unmix model could provide a novel method for quantitative identification of the multiple sources of pfass in aquatic environment although pfoa manufacturing is regulated in european countries and america they are still manufactured in china in two typical manufacturing techniques namely electrochemical fluorination ecf and telomerization benskin et al 2010 jin et al 2015 benskin et al 2010 developed a method to estimate the contributions of ecf and telomerization based on statistical analysis and the ratios of specific isomers the contribution of ecf product was derived from a calibration curve based on the standards of ecf product and linear pfoa n pfoa which was only effective in a narrow concentration range based on the law of conservation of mass chemical mass balance cmb model looks for the best linear fit of the chemical compositions released from multiple sources with fixed fingerprints to reconstruct the chemical compositions in the environmental samples zheng et al 2002 considering that the isomeric fingerprints of the commercial pfoa products are relatively consistent benskin et al 2010 cmb model could quantitatively assess the contributions of pfoa manufacturing sources for pfos ecf was the primary manufacturing technique and enrichment of branched br pfos isomers in water phase was observed which was proposed to be due to preferential biotransformation of br isomers of the pfos precursors in aquatic environment benskin et al 2010 yu et al 2013 however there was no direct evidence to support this assumption mostly due to the lack of quantitative analytical methods for measuring the isomers of pfos precursors such as perfluorooctane sulfonamide pfosa in the environment recently our group developed an analytical method for identification and quantification of pfosa isomers in complicated matrices shan et al 2019 which provides a useful measure to quantify their isomers in real environmental samples in this study raw samples including surface waters n 40 suspended particulate matters spm n 39 and sediments n 20 were collected in hai river basin 8 rivers and 3 reservoirs many of the rivers flow through industrial areas such as steel plants chemical plants refiners and megacities twenty six emerging and legacy pfass were measured in these samples a receptor model unmix was introduced to apportion the sources of emerging and legacy pfass and an algorithm coupled one way anova with cmb model was developed for tracing the manufacturing sources of pfoa the partitioning behaviors of novel alternatives between sediment and water were compared with those of legacy pfass by calculating the empirical k oc values for the first time the isomeric compositions of pfosa in natural surface water were measured and the difference in the isomeric profiles between the real samples and ecf standards was compared to give clues on enrichment of br pfos in surface water the results of this study provide novel insights into elucidating the spatial distribution and complicated sources of pfass in complex river systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection the sampling campaign took place in hai river basin in october 2017 at the sampling sites selected according to the guidelines of national environmental monitoring program of china as shown in fig 1 the sampling sites were located in 8 rivers and 3 reservoirs detailed information of each site is listed in table s1 forty surface water samples and 20 sediments were collected five liters of surface water were collected from each site and filtered through a glass fiber filter 142 mm pore diameter 0 7 μm millipore corp usa to obtain suspended particulate matter spm the filtered water was stored in high density polyethylene bottle previously rinsed with methanol followed by ultrapure water while the spm was freeze dried and weighted one kg of sediment was collected using a hand piston sediment sampler and stored in low density polyethylene bags at 4 c the detailed sampling information is described in si 2 2 chemicals and solvents the following substances were monitored in the samples pfcas c4 c14 perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas c4 c10 even pfosa cl pfesas 6 2 and 8 2 fts 4 2 6 2 and 8 2 ammonium 4 8 dioxa 3h perfluorononanoate adona 6 2 dipap hfpo da hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid hfpo ta pfechs most of the native and mass labeled reference standards were purchased from wellington laboratories guelph canada except hfpo ta which was obtained from fluorochem old glossop uk the molecular formula and chemical structures of the pfass and reagents used in this study are all supplied in si 2 3 sample extraction and instrumental analysis the target pfass in the dissolved phase of surface water were extracted by solid phase extraction using a cartridge cleanert pep 500 mg 6 ml agela technology china the sediment and spm samples were extracted by ultrasonication with methanol and followed by purification with cleanert pep cartridges the details about the extraction and purification spm and in sediment are provided in si the target pfass were analyzed on an acquity uplc coupled to a xevo tq s triple quadrupole mass spectrometer waters milford ma usa the isomers of pfos pfoa and pfosa were separated and quantified by uplc ms ms electrospray ionization in negative mode with a fluorosep rp octyl column the information about lc ms ms operation conditions and quality control is provided in si the optimized parameters of lc ms ms are supplied in table s2 and the method detection limits mdls and recoveries of each pfas are provided in table s3 the details of the method for separating pfosa isomers are provided in a previous study shan et al 2019 2 4 quality assurance and quality control all pretreatment procedures were conducted in a clean laboratory at nankai university triplicate recovery experiments were performed by spiking a certain amount of pfas standards in the dissolved water phase spm and sediment samples separately a six point calibration curve of each pfas was prepared for quantification r2 0 99 the isomers of pfoa and pfos were quantified using the characterized technical pfoa t pfoa and br pfosk standards obtained from wellington pfosa isomers were quantified with the characterized pfosa standards in a previous study shan et al 2019 the recoveries of all the target pfass were in the range of 65 7 129 73 5 119 and 59 8 137 in the dissolved water phase spm and sediment samples respectively si table s3 the method detection limits mdls were defined as the concentrations with a signal to noise ratio of three plus three times the standard deviations of the blank responses a procedural blank was set up with each batch of 12 samples no detectable contamination was found for most pfass except for low levels of pfoa and pfhxs perfluorohexane sulfonate and pfos the blank levels of these compounds were subtracted from the accompanied batch samples 2 5 statistical analyses the field based sediment or spm dissolved water distribution coefficient of pfass k d cm3 g was calculated using the following equation 1 k d c s c w cs is the concentration of individual pfas ng g dw in solid phase sediment or spm while cw is the concentration in dissolved water collected from the same site the organic carbon normalized sediment water distribution coefficients k oc cm3 g of pfass was derived from the k d value using the following equation 2 k o c 100 k d f o c f oc is the percentage of organic carbon in sediment or spm samples si table s4 the details for the determination of organic carbon is described in si one way analysis of variance anova was applied to compare pfoa isomer profiles between the samples and ecf standard and compare the log k oc values of different pfass all statistical analyses were performed with ibm spss statistics 21 the concentrations below mdl were set as half of the mdl for statistical purposes 2 6 unmix model epa unmix 6 0 was used in this study unmix assumes that the compositions and contributions of the pollution sources are positive by analyzing the concentration data of given species unmix estimates the number of sources source compositions and source contributions at each sampling site considering that accurate information is needed for the source apportionment the pfass with low detection frequencies 50 and fitting coefficients r2 0 3 were excluded from the model the species with high variance 50 were also suggested to be excluded by unmix model qi et al 2017 twelve pfass in surface water including dissolved phase and spm phase were selected for identification of the sources by unmix model c4 11 pfcas pfhxs 6 2 fts 6 2 cl pfesa and hfpo da unmix aims to reduce the normalized source profiles by projecting 13 40 dataset including σ21pfass to a plane perpendicular to the first axis of a space composed of n independent elements and the normalized contributions of each source could be predicted in the edges of the projected data pfos and pfosa were excluded from this model because their fitting results were poor r2 0 3 this might be because that pfosa could transform to pfoa in aquatic environment the sources were identified by characteristic compounds with significant uses for example 6 2 cl pfesa f 53b has been applied as a mist suppressant in metal plating industries for decades in china and it was then selected as the marker of metal plating source wang et al 2013a the characteristic pfass in each source were identified by unmix fig s2 the minimum r2 of the result was 0 70 while the minimum s n was 2 60 the signal to noise ratio was calculated as described by henry et al 1999 by numfact the predicted results were calculated by adding the measured concentrations and residuals calculated by unmix the details of the algorithms can be found in the references henry 1997 2003 weighted linear regression was used to fit the predicted and observed concentrations of total pfass the regression equation is y 1 06x 0 174 r2 0 936 2 7 cmb model to apply cmb model several assumptions need to be satisfied 1 the compositions of the source should be fixed over the period of sampling 2 the pfass should not react with each other 3 all sources should be identified and have their specific profiles 4 the different sources should be linear to each other 5 uncertainties of the measurements should be random uncorrelated and normally distributed an et al 2003 the above assumptions were satisfied for identification of pfoa manufacturing sources the fingerprints are generally consistent ecf 77 3 linear and 22 6 branched jiang et al 2015 linear telomer 100 linear and isopropyl telomer 100 iso pfoa it is assumed that other manufacturing sources were negligible because of their minor production volume benskin et al 2009 nkcmb 2 0 which is the chinese version of epa cmb 8 2 and was developed by nankai university china was used for tracing pfoa manufacturing source further details and information can be found in the references an et al 2003 li et al 2001 one way anova following the benskin s method was conducted to identify the potential manufacturing sources benskin et al 2010 then the cmb model was used for calculating the contributions of the individual sources 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of pfass in the surface water and sediment twenty six emerging and legacy pfass were analyzed in the surface water including dissolved phase and particle phase and sediment samples from hai river basin the levels of pfass in each sample are listed in tables s5 7 the levels of pfass in the surface water including dissolved phase and particle phase are shown in fig 2 8 2 cl pfesa adona pfds perfluorodecane sulfonate pftrda perfluorotridecanoate and pfteda perfluorotetradecanoate were not detected in any of the water samples the total concentrations of other pfass σ21pfass were in the range of 1 74 172 ng l with the mean and median levels as 26 6 and 19 9 ng l respectively which was similar to the results reported in other 18 chinese rivers 16 3 ng l median wang et al 2016b pfoa 0 279 22 6 ng l was predominant with an average contribution of 17 7 in the σ21pfass pfoa concentration was comparable to that at the mouth of hai river pfoa 20 ng l reported previously wang et al 2016b in 2008 pfoa was listed on the catalogue of high pollution high environmental risk chemicals by ministry of ecological environment of china meec ministry of ecological environment of china 2008 and was listed in the candidate catalogue of stockholm convention in 2015 unep united nations environment programme 2015 pfos and pfosf were included in the stockholm convention in 2009 unep united nations environment programme it was worth noting that the c4 7 pfcas accounted for a large proportion 45 mean value of the σ21pfass meaning that short chain pfass are replacing pfoa and other longer chain pfcas ritter 2010 wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 zhou et al 2013 some emerging pfass were detected in most of the water samples the detection frequencies of hfpo da 0 316 ng l mean value hfpo ta 1 00 ng l and 6 2 cl pfesa 0 335 ng l were 82 5 100 and 95 0 respectively this indicated that these emerging pfass are being used widely in the hai river basin as substituents for the legacy pfass fig s1 shows the concentrations and profiles of pfass in the sediment samples of hai river basin the detection frequencies of perfluorobutanoate pfba pfhxs and pfteda were 30 different from the water samples c9 12 pfcas 0 172 ng l mean value accounted for a dominating proportion 17 2 mean value in the sediments a couple of long chain pfass 8 2 cl pfesa pfds and pfdoa were detected in 80 of the sediment samples but they were not detected in any surface water samples this suggests that long chain pfass were more inclined to partition to sediment than the short chain ones zhao et al 2012 it is interesting that the level of hfpo ta in the sediment was comparable to those of c9 12 pfcas which provided another evidence that hfpo oligomers are being applied widely 3 2 spatial distribution and source apportionment of pfass in hai river basin fig 2 indicates that the levels of pfass in surface water at the sites close to the reservoirs including erwangzhuang reservoir er yuqiao reservoir yr and miyun reservoir mr except for mr1 and mr4 were significantly lower than the river sites p 0 05 this suggested that the drinking water source areas in hai river basin are generally well protected although mr1 and mr4 are close and originated from the miyun reservoir they run through miyun industrial park beijing the discharge from the industrial park may be responsible for the higher σ21pfass at these two sites the σ21pfass in the surface water samples ranged from 1 74 ng l at yuqiao reservoir yr6 to 172 ng l at ziya river z2 both the concentrations and dominant congeners varied greatly among the sites which is understandable since the sampling campaign covered rural and urban areas with different industrial characteristics within a range of 170 km there are a couples of previous studies reporting the occurrence of pfass in hai river since the stockholm convention in 2009 li et al 2011 meng et al 2017 pan et al 2011 wang et al 2016b zhao et al 2016 in all of these studies pfoa 5 20 ng l was the dominant pfas compound in the surface water the aqueous concentration of pfos was below 10 ng l while it was predominant in the sediment and the short chain pfcas were detected with concentrations slightly lower than pfoa these results indicated that the concentrations of pfass in hai river were relatively stable and the results obtained in this study were suitable for the source apportionment of pfass in this basin it is difficult to identify the emission sources in this large river system by ratio method and correlation analysis therefore a receptor model unmix was utilized to identify the sources and their specific contributions for pfass in hai river basin four sources were identified by unmix model and fig 3 a illustrates that the predicted and observed values of σ21pfass were in a good correlation r2 0 936 p 0 001 source 1 was dominated by pfoa and perfluorononanoate pfna while 6 2 cl pfesa was also distinct in this source table s8 pfoa and pfna are widely used in the production of fluororesin coatings which are applied further in metal plating industries qi et al 2017 therefore source 1 was identified as the source of fluororesin coatings metal plating source 2 was characterized by the high percentage of pfhxs which is extensively used as a surfactant to produce fluoropolymers or a protective agent in papers and textiles ntc national toxicology program 2012 lee and viberg 2013 kim et al 2018 thus source 2 was representative of surfactants protective agents 6 2 fts pfba and hfpo da were the main components of source 3 pfba and hfpo da are substitutes of pfoa and widely used in many fluoropolymer production as processing aids heydebreck et al 2015 wang et al 2013b 2016a since 6 2 fts is frequently detected in surface water contaminated by fire fighting foam and it was reported to be the dominant pfas in current afff produced in china mumtaz et al 2019 d agostino and mabury 2017 jin et al 2017 nguyen et al 2011 it was assumed to be the characteristic pfas in the afff products thus source 3 was identified as firefighting foam fluoropolymer processing aids source 4 was distinguished due to the high load of perfluoropentanoate pfpea perfluoroundecanoate pfuda and perfludecanoate pfda pfuda and pfda were selected as the markers because of their specific application in textile treatments cai et al 2012 as a short chain pfca pfpea is widely used in fast food packages zafeiraki et al 2014 accordingly source 4 was regarded as textile treatments food packages taking hai river basin as a whole fig 3b indicates that source 3 i e fire fighting foam fluoropolymer processing aids 36 6 and source 1 metal plating fluororesin coatings 33 7 were the major sources of pfass which were followed by source 4 textile treatments food packages 17 7 and source 2 surfactants protective agents 12 0 the contribution of each source to the total load of pfass varied a lot among the rivers and reservoirs source 4 textile treatments food packages was the major emission source of pfass in beipai river b and chaobai river cb canglang river cl and duliuxian river d were dominated by source 1 fluororesin coatings metal plating the source contributions in jiyun river j and miyun reservior were relatively equal and source 1 and 4 were the main sources whereas the source contributions changed greatly in hai river and yongding river y indicating that multiple sources existed in these two rivers the especially high contribution of one specific source at certain sites implied there were specific point sources near the sites for instance the major source at the sites such as d2 and y1 fig 3c was predominantly contributed by source 1 fluororesin coatings metal plating 67 0 and 72 1 respectively there is a resin coating plant in the upper reach of d2 and two metal plating factories in the upstream of y1 which may explain the high contribution of source 1 at these two sites source 2 surfactants protective agents was not significant at most sites except for z1 and z2 dagang oilfield tianjin is in the north and two petroleum adjuvants factories which used a large amount of surfactants are within 3 km of z1 and z2 source 3 firefighting foam fluoropolymer processing aids was observed at all sites and higher contribution was found at sites of hai river h3 h4 and yongding river y2 the emission source at h3 and h4 might be a fire extinguisher factory and langfang airport located at the upstream of y2 source 4 accounted for the largest proportion at sites b2 and b3 a paper industrial park is located in the middle of b2 and b3 and a factory of packaging products is close to b3 these factories may be responsible for the pfass pollution caused by food packages some precursors such as paps and telomer based products could transform into pfcas through microbial degradation or photolysis holly et al 2010 houtz et al 2013 liu and mejia avendano 2013 however the transformation rate e g 6 2 fts was relatively low in the environment yin et al 2019 thus the contribution due to transformation is supposed to be low 3 3 isomeric profiles and manufacturing origins of pfoa the isomer profiles of pfoa in surface water samples including dissolved phase and spm phase are illustrated in fig 4 a the samples with the concentrations of two and more isomers below the mdls were excluded to reduce interference linear n pfoa was the predominant pfoa isomer with an average proportion of 82 6 5 31 the branched isomers were on the order of iso pfoa 8 34 2 71 4m pfoa 4 54 1 55 5m pfoa 4 49 1 38 which was similar to that in the ecf commercial product but the profiles of individual isomers in each river differed with a large variation ecf and n telomerization are the two primary manufacturing methods to produce pfoa while iso telomerization also exists in asia benskin et al 2010 therefore a source apportionment is meaningful for tracing the manufacturing sources of pfoa a receptor model chemical mass balance cmb was introduced to quantitatively assess the contributions of the three manufacturing sources the sites with the highest pfoa concentration b1 cb4 cl2 d2 h7 j4 y1 and z1 in each river were selected to run the model because these sites were most probably closest to the point sources the ecf reference standard utilized in this study has been reported in a previous study jiang et al 2015 the ratios iso n 4m n and 5m n at b1 cb4 d2 and j4 were not statistically different from those in the ecf standards p 0 05 this suggested that ecf was probably the predominant manufacturing source of pfoa in these rivers if a significant difference was observed an additional anova was performed on 5m iso and 4m iso values there was significant difference in these two ratios for site h7 this suggested that n telomerization and ecf were the two manufacturing sources in hai river thus ecf and n telomerization were selected as the sources of h7 in cmb model table 1 shows the cmb modeling results which indicated that ecf contributed 69 2 of total pfoa while 30 8 was resulted from n telomerization the third anova on 4m 5m was performed if significant difference was still observed when the ratio of 4m 5m was not statistically different from the ecf standard additional contribution from iso telomerization was potential manufacturing source which was observed at that sites of cl2 and z1 the contribution of iso telomerization source was 2 84 and 1 48 at cl2 and z1 respectively the ratios of 4m n 4m iso and 4m 5 m at y1 were significantly higher than those of the ecf standard indicating that specific manufacturing sources for 4m pfoa or active biotransformation might exist in yongding river benskin et al 2010 the cmb model coupled with the benskin s method inferred that ecf was the primary pfoa manufacturing source followed by n telomerization whereas iso telomerization occasionally existed in a few sites in the hai river basin 3 4 isomer profiles of pfos and pfosa the profiles of individual branched pfos isomers in hai river basin are shown in fig 4b and the samples with two or more isomers below mdls were excluded m 2 and 2m pfos were not included because of their low content 0 6 in the standard and commercial products branched pfos isomers ranged from 26 9 beipai river to 48 9 duliuxian river the percentage of br pfos especially iso pfos was higher than that of ecf standard which was similar with those reported in previous studies chen et al 2015b fang et al 2014 magali et al 2008 pfos and pfosa were exclusively manufactured by ecf process it was suggested that preferential biotransformation of the branched isomers of pfos precursors such as pfosa made a great contribution to the enrichment of br pfos in aquatic environment yu et al 2013 identification of the isomers of pfosa an important pfos precursors would give a direct evidence for this hypothesis a quantitative lc ms ms method for pfosa isomers was developed by our group and was applied to analyze them in the water samples shan et al 2019 because of the relatively low concentrations of the total pfosa only one branched isomer iso pfosa was detected above the mdl in a few samples the ratio iso pfosa n pfosa was calculated for these samples and compared with that of ecf pfosa standard the ratio in the water samples 0 05 0 02 was significantly p 0 01 lower than that in ecf pfosa standard 0 14 0 01 implying that iso pfosa might be easier to biotransform than n pfosa in natural aquatic environment this result was in agreement with a previous study which reported that branched pfosa isomers were preferentially metabolized to br pfos than n pfosa in common carp chen et al 2015a the preferential biotransformation of iso pfosa could make a contribution to the enrichment of iso pfos in river ecosystems 3 5 the replacing trends of novel pfas alternatives some emerging alternatives of legacy ones including short chain perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas hfpo oligomers and f 53b were frequently detected in hai river basin the ratios r of their concentrations to those of the corresponding legacy ones were calculated to probe into the replacement occurring in the market some short chain pfass such as pfba and pfbs are considered to be sustainable alternatives to long chain pfass since they could be less bio accumulative in aquatic organisms wang et al 2016a many studies reported that pfba or pfbs became the dominant pfas compound in surface water in recent years due to the shifting of commercial products in the market of north and central china wang et al 2016a zhao et al 2016 zhou et al 2013 as shown in fig s3 the median ratios of pfba pfoa and pfbs pfos were 0 804 and 0 394 respectively the ratio of pfba pfoa in this study was comparable to that 0 697 median reported previously in 10 major watersheds in china table s10 chen et al 2018b liu et al 2015 pan et al 2014 2018 wang et al 2014 2016a 2016b zhao et al 2016 zhou et al 2013 both ratios of pfba pfoa and pfbs pfos in this study were higher than the mean values 0 355 0 130 respectively monitored in the mouth of haihe river in 2013 wang et al 2016b these results indicate that replacement with pfba and pfbs as alternatives of the legacy pfass is increasing in hai river basin since 2013 pfecas and pfesas are other two kinds of alternatives to legacy pfass hfpo oligomers hfpo da and hfpo ta are mainly used as processing aids in producing fluoropolymer products the median ratio of hfpo da pfoa was 0 0637 in hai river basin which was at a relatively low level compared with other major water systems in china 0 219 median the ratio of hfpo ta pfoa 0 244 median was higher than that of hfpo da pfoa hfpo ta has a longer carbon chain than hfpo da and is widely applied in synthesizing poly vinylidene fluoride millauer et al 2010 as a mist suppressant in metal plating industry wang et al 2013a f 53b was also widely distributed in the hai river basin however the ratio of f 53b pfos 0 105 median was relatively low compared with the major water systems in china indicating that f 53b was prevalent but not the dominant alternative in hai river basin in summary various pfas alternatives are being used as substituents of the legacy pfass in different extents in hai river basin and short chain pfass were the major alternatives 3 6 the partitioning behaviors of emerging and legacy pfass as discussed above different pfas profiles were observed in the dissolved phase and sediment which could be due to the different partitioning behaviors of pfass field based k oc values were calculated to illustrate the partitioning behaviors of the emerging and legacy pfass in aquatic environment fig 5 some pfass e g pfba pfpea pfdoa pfbs pfds their k oc values were not calculated because of their low detection frequencies in the dissolved phase spm or sediment the log k oc values ranged from 2 75 0 59 perfluorohexanoate pfhxa to 5 51 1 18 6 2 dipap displaying a general increasing trend with the carbon chain length increasing this was in accordance with that reported in previous studies chen et al 2015b 2018b the log k oc values of several novel alternatives were compared to those of pfaas with the same number of fluorinated carbons cf both hfpo da and pfhxa have five perfluorinated carbon atoms cf 5 and their log k oc values 2 85 0 61 vs 2 75 0 59 were similar p 0 05 this implied that insertion of an ether linkage did not significantly influence the partitioning behaviors of the pfass gomis et al 2015 in contrast the log k oc of f 53b 4 49 0 64 was significantly p 0 05 higher than that pfos 3 75 0 61 even they have the same number of cf the replacement of one end f by cl atom and the addition of an ether linkage result in a larger molecular size 407 91 413 61 å than pfos 381 77 å in addition the cl atom contributes to greater hydrophobicity of the fluorinated carbon chain which could explain the stronger adsorption of f 53b on solid particular phase chen et al 2018a it is worth noting that the log k oc value of hfpo ta 4 25 0 76 was obviously higher than that of pfna with the same cf which could be explained by the larger molecular size of hfpo ta containing two ether linkages previous studies reported that the log k oc of pfosa was slightly higher than that of pfos and the n alkyl substitution was responsible for the enhanced log k oc chen et al 2018b gebbink et al 2016 munoz et al 2015 in this study the log k oc of pfosa 3 59 0 56 was similar to that of pfos 3 75 0 61 which might be due to the active biotransformation of pfosa in sediment however the spm derived log k oc of pfosa 5 53 0 51 was higher than pfos 5 04 0 78 this further fortifies that pfosa could experience biotransformation by microorganisms in sediment and led to its lower sediment derived log k oc fig s4 similar with other studies spm derived log k oc of pfass were one log unit higher than the corresponding values derived from sediments but there was a very good correlation between them lutz et al 2010 shan et al 2014 usually the particles of spm are smaller than those of sediments thus spm displayed higher sorption capacity due to the large specific surface areas and more adsorption sites available for pollutant adsorption shan et al 2014 zhao et al 2012 4 conclusions the experimental results present in our study demonstrated that legacy pfass notably pfoa and novel alternatives notably short chain pfcas and f 53b were widely distributed in hai river basin the existence of emerging and legacy pfass in aquatic environment makes it hard to recognize the complicated sources for the purpose of pollution control the receptor models which have been usually applied in source apportionment of organic pollutants and particulate matters in the atmosphere larsen and baker 2003 zhang et al 2012 may provide a quantitative identification of the sources of pfass in surface river systems the results indicated that fire fighting foam fluoropolymer processing aids 36 6 were the dominant source of pfass in the hai river basin the commercial products of some pfas compounds such as pfoa pfos and pfosa have a fixed fingerprints of their isomers combing a previous developed method based on the ratios of various isomers a receptor model such as cmb could provide more accurate and quantitative information to trace pfoa manufacturing sources for the first time the isomers of pfosa were quantified in the environmental samples the shortage of iso pfosa relative to the commercial product provided further evidences that branched isomers such as iso pfosa were more easily biotransformed than n pfosa and suggested that the preferential biotransformation of branched precursors of pfos make a contribution to the enrichment of br pfos in the aquatic environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

silica fouling during groundwater reverse osmosis ro treatment can have a significant impact on filtration performance to better understand this phenomenon the equilibrium kinetics of amorphous colloidal silica were studied at conditions relevant to ro of silica rich alkaline groundwater the impact of particle size was investigated using synthetic monodisperse silica nanoparticles bench scale experiments were conducted by monitoring dissolved silica concentration of aqueous suspensions of colloids of 100 and 300 nm diameter and ph 8 5 to 9 5 the equilibrium data was determined from existing established rate law equations this study concluded that surface energy has a major impact on silica dissolution rate constant particularly for colloidal silica observations of ostwald ripening in bidisperse silica dispersions further confirmed these results which indicate that dissolution and redeposition is responsible for the problematic silica fouling behaviour during ro treatment 2d modelling based on inferred equilibrium data allows visualization of scale layer growth in agreement with cross sectional scanning electron micrographs of autopsied membranes graphical abstract image 1 keywords silica dissolution particle radius of curvature ostwald ripening 1 introduction groundwater desalination is vital for water supply as well as management of water extracted during mining and agricultural activities in many parts of the world reverse osmosis ro membrane separation is widely used for this purpose with the products being desalinated water and brine for example the burgeoning australian coal seam gas csg industry is currently projecting a peak water production of 85 gl year in queensland alone underschultz et al 2018 a significant portion of which is treated by reverse osmosis treatment of such inland brackish groundwaters is often hindered by silica fouling significantly impacting ro performance through increased costs and limited brine minimization lunevich et al 2017 ning 2010 silica fouling is especially problematic as it is difficult to remove and can lead to severe flux decline as silica concentrations reach saturation silica polymerizes and forms colloidal nanoparticles which can deposit on virgin or fouled membranes kley et al 2014 through either aggregation or further polymerization these particles may grow to submicron sizes and are typically observed by sem micrographs as particulate fouling on the membrane surface recent work has captured and characterized these nanoparticles from csg brine donose et al 2017 zaman et al 2015 the time dependent nature of the silica deposit has been noted in numerous studies milne et al 2014 thompson et al 2017 with the central observation being a change in morphology of the fouling layer from particulate to a smooth glassy deposit iler proposed that this fouling rearrangement was a function of the silica solubility equilibrium and the preferential dissolution and re polymerization to minimize the surface energy iler 1979 see fig 1 the formation of a glassy smooth surfaced deposit reduces the available surface area reducing flux and inhibiting effective cleaning silica polymerization and dissolution reactions follow the equilibrium reaction between silicic acid aqueous and silica solid rimstidt et al 2016 1 s i o 4 s 2 h 2 o h 4 s i o 4 a q under alkaline conditions ph 7 5 silicic acid dissociates to a silicate ion 2 h 4 s i o 4 a q h h 3 s i o 4 while these reactions are suitable for describing the bulk reaction rate in a heterogeneous system particularly those involving nanoparticles the contribution of the surface energy should not be overlooked dove et al 2008 the impact of particle surface and radius of curvature on polymerisation and dissolution has previously been studied but without conclusive results fundamentally it is expected the solubility of silica is higher when the surface is convex and lower when it is concave with a smaller radius of curvature having a greater impact but published results have been mixed showing that the dissolution rate for smaller particles either increases goto 1958 decreases diedrich et al 2012 or is independent of particle size rimer et al 2007 this disparity in results could potentially be due to particle aggregation or zeta potential differences particularly above ph 6 overshadowing the effect of particle size diedrich et al 2012 the variability in dissolution rate as a function of curvature is observable as ostwald ripening ostwald 1897 this occurs where smaller more soluble particles preferentially dissolve while dissolved material deposits onto the larger less soluble particles the net result is growth of the larger particles while the smaller particles dissolve while there are many studies of ripening phenomenon of metallic nanoparticles there have been limited observations for silica nanoparticles of note are two studies however those studies were inapplicable to fouling as they were in the presence of either buffers vogelsberger and schmidt 2018 or were for unrelated forms of silica lazaro et al 2013 the relationship between the radius of curvature and silica properties could be critical for understanding and predicting the behavior of colloidal silica particles and their impact on ro operability in this work we investigate 1 the equilibrium kinetics specifically the rates of dissolution and polymerization as a function of the radius of curvature understanding these rates and their potential contribution to observed fouling morphologies may provide insights into flux decline from silica fouling during reverse osmosis 2 the impact of ph on silica solubility typically groundwater exhibits high levels of alkalinity making significant ph variations unviable due to the cost of acid milne et al 2014 however regional differences in the ph of groundwater may be significant in comparing fouling behavior 3 the nanoparticle size evolution in a bimodally dispersed suspension with the view to assessing ostwald ripening phenomenon this phenomenon may be an overlooked contributor to silica fouling 4 how the three previous elements combine to contribute to the morphology of silica fouling both modeled from the experiment data and observed during csg ro membrane autopsies 2 experimental a series of bench scale experiments using aqueous dispersions of synthetic amorphous silica nanoparticles were conducted to establish equilibrium conditions and determine the rates of silica dissolution and polymerization these were performed at a range of phs 8 5 9 5 and particle sizes 50 150 nm radius particle size distributions were monitored at specific time intervals to determine evolution trends and signs of agglomeration 2 1 materials 2 1 1 silica nanoparticles nanocomposix nanoxact 100 nm and 300 nm diameter silica nanospheres were selected for their pure silica composition without any stabilizing agent and monodispersity as shown in table 1 all analysis and modelling was based on the transmission electron microscopy tem reported particles size while in this work we refer to 50 and 150 nm radius particles for simplicity 2 1 2 reagents all reagents used including those for the silicomolybdate method were sourced from sigma aldrich purity 98 all waters were purified using reverse osmosis followed by a mixed bed resin polisher system resulting in a conductivity of 0 052 μs cm 2 2 methods 2 2 1 silica dissolution and polymerisation silica nanoparticle suspensions were stored in 50 ml sterile containers polypropylene and kept in motion on an orbital shaker for the entirety of the experiment which was conducted in a controlled temperature laboratory 23 2 c for more than 60 days the ph was manually maintained during dissolution through addition of minute volumes 20 μl of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide of 10m concentration see table 2 to focus on the impact of the radius of curvature the initial surface area was selected to maintain an equivalent surface area available for mass transfer the particle surface areas was calculated geometrically from the particle size further details are available in the supplementary materials the concentration of reactive silica was observed to initially increase linearly before approaching a stable equilibrium after several weeks 2 2 2 silicomolybdate method the net dissolution of silica nanoparticles was determined by the molybdenum blue method eaton et al 1998 this method is widely used throughout industry and in previous studies of silica dissolution and polymerization kley et al 2014 ning 2010 ammonium molybdate reacts with any reactive silica under acidic conditions to produce the yellow heteropolyacid reactive silica comprises of any monomeric silica including ionized forms and potentially any dissolved dimer ning 2010 through addition of a reducing agent this can be converted to blue species with a significantly higher absorbance suitable for very low concentration samples this paper closely follows the method summarised by kley et al 2017 but converted for a small analytical volume 150 μl to reduce potential variation during the experiment the absorbance of the reduced silicomolybdate species was measured with a hach dr1900 portable spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 815 nm uncertainty in the calibrated silica measurements were determined to be 5 consistent with reported values diedrich et al 2012 2 2 3 ph stabilisation as silica dissolves above ph 7 5 the silicic acid ionizes causing ph reduction to maintain a stable solution ph minute volumes 20 μl of sodium hydroxide were added ph stability improved as the volume of silica dissolving reduced with initial ph adjustments required hourly to maintain ph 0 1 a small salt concentration 0 01 mmol nacl was added to ensure conductivity to improve ph reading accuracy only preparation of a solution with enough buffering capacity was not considered as it would require concentrations that likely alter results significantly salt ions catalyze dissolution and reduce the silica solubility marshall and warakomski 1980 2 2 4 modelling understanding the rates of silica dissolution and polymerization is a complex exercise with varying methods and approaches presented in the literature mazer and walther 1994 to investigate the impact the radius of curvature has on silica equilibrium kinetics two parallel but closely related modelling approaches were applied see fig 2 the first a fixed radius model assumes the radius of curvature does not vary significantly over the course of the trial and focuses on comparing the different particle sizes tested the second modelling approach a variable radius model fits the variation of rate constants with the modified kelvin equation the second modelling approach was adopted after the first approach demonstrated that silica dissolution does vary significantly with particle size and it was based on knowledge that the particles did change size over the course of the experiment as described by the modified kelvin equation decreasing particle size enhances solubility by increasing the surface free energy diedrich et al 2012 3 s s 0 e x p 4 γ v r t d where for a particle diameter d the solubility s is a function of the solubility of a particle of infinite diameter s 0 the surface free energy γ the solid phase molecular volume v gas constant r and temperature t this equation was used to describe the relationship between dissolution rate and surface curvature both from the reduction in particle size during dissolution and the different particle sizes studied to undertake this modeling the silica particles were treated as spheres with constant density and a geometric surface area the validity of these assumptions was verified through determining particle size distributions 2 2 4 1 equilibrium kinetics the rate laws equations 4 and 5 and mass balance equation 6 8 were derived from the silica equilibrium equations 1 and 2 and assuming a pseudo first order reaction icenhower and dove 2000 silica ionization which occurs above ph 7 5 was assumed to be much faster and therefore modeled as instantaneous 4 r d i s s k 1 c s i o 2 5 r p o l y k 2 c h 4 s i o 4 6 d c s i o 2 d t r d i s s r p o l y 7 d c h 4 s i o 4 d t x h 4 s i o 4 r d i s s r p o l y 8 d c h 3 s i o 4 d t 1 x h 4 s i o 4 r d i s s r p o l y where r d i s s and r p o l y refer to the dissolution and polymerization rates and k 1 and k 2 to their respective rate constants equation 6 through 8 describe the change in concentration of the three modelled species over time the silica speciation x h 4 s i o 4 shown as the mole fraction of non ionized silica was modelled through the pitzer equation 2 2 4 2 silica speciation under alkaline conditions silica h4sio4 has four ionizable hydrogens with pka values of 9 9 11 8 12 and 12 respectively ning 2010 at the experimental conditions up to 30 of the dissolved silica may be present in an ionized form fig 3 shows the silica speciation variation with ph for these experimental conditions with vertical lines indicating the three ph values studies table 2 this fraction can be critical as charged ionized species are much more soluble fleming and crerar 1982 but also more prone to precipitation in this case as sodium silicate the speciation of silica present during these experiments was modeled using the pitzer equation in phreeqc charlton and parkhurst 2011 2 2 5 particle size distributions the particle size distributions used in this study were generated using novel nanoparticle tracking analysis nta on the nanosight n300 this technique uses laser light scattering microscopy to identify and track individual nanoparticles diameters from 30 to 1000 nm and calculate the particle size from the observed brownian motion according to the stokes einstein equation filipe et al 2010 this method was selected over the more prevalent dynamic light scattering dls method because of two key advantages firstly nta can easily detect the formation of aggregates formation of these aggregates during the dissolution experiments was identified as a potential risk severely impacting surface area and curvature assumptions since the method is based on individual nanoparticles tracking the presence of aggregates is directly observed tian et al 2016 these same aggregates have a tremendous influence on the results of dls as the intensity of the light scattered is proportional to the sixth power of the particle diameter filipe et al 2010 secondly the nanoparticle tracking analysis is very sensitive to individual particle sizes allowing for better accuracy for polydisperse nanoparticle distributions filipe et al 2010 this accuracy is critical in studying bimodal dispersed nanoparticles for monitoring ostwald ripening while well suited for this application the use of nta does present a unique set of challenges compared to dls based size analysis the sizing is much more time intensive requiring sample handling and dilution and thorough cleaning between samples details of the analytical parameters used for this study are included in the supplementary materials 2 2 6 imaging the morphology of the fouling layer deposited onto the membrane surface was examined by a scanning electron microscope joel 7001 fe sem in back scattered bs and secondary electron se imaging modes freeze liquid nitrogen snapped membranes were imaged and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds surveyed at 10 kv accelerating voltages without further coating 3 results and discussion 3 1 silica dissolution and polymerization a series of beaker experiments were completed to investigate the two particle sizes refer to table 3 for the corresponding conditions and three phs refer to table 2 to focus on the impact of the radius of curvature the initial surface area was selected to maintain an equivalent surface area available for mass transfer the concentration of reactive silica was observed to initially increase linearly before approaching a stable equilibrium after 20 30 days fig 4 3 1 1 silica solubility the observed silica equilibrium reflects the silica solubility which corresponds well with the literature milne et al 2014 solubility values presented in the literature have been derived from a range of silica sources experimental conditions and methods this data confirms that results when using nanocomposix silica nanoparticles align well in terms of composition and dissolution behaviour with other forms of silica used in the literature the experimentally observed solubility of silica varies significantly between ph 8 5 and 9 5 in good agreement with prediction based on the pitzer model see fig 5 3 1 2 silica equilibrium kinetics both silica dissolution and polymerization rate constants k1 and k2 respectively were determined from the batch experiments inspection of the data in table 4 and fig 6 shows that while the dissolution kinetics differ significantly for different particle sizes the polymerization kinetics are relatively unaffected this difference equates to a 3 5 times faster dissolution for 48 nm radius particles relative to the 150 nm radius particles a clear trend is apparent in fig 6 with increasing ph accelerating both the polymerization and dissolution kinetics the equilibrium kinetics derived from these bench scale experiments show a clear increase in dissolution rate for smaller particles this result while consistent with an earlier study of silica dissolution goto 1958 is in disagreement with more recent studies diedrich et al 2012 rimer et al 2007 this disagreement may be attributed to different experimental conditions in fact some other studies data not shown comparing similar concentrations of silica nanoparticles as opposed to the similar surface areas used in this study did not demonstrate significant differences in dissolution kinetics as the results in fig 6 show silica dissolution is clearly affected by the surface energy and as such experiments comparing significantly different surface areas will have errors apparent discrepancies between the data points of the fixed radius model and the fitted curves of the variable radius model are from the different modelling approaches refer to fig 2 the polymerization rate does not appear to be impacted by particle size and hence it has been assumed constant for the variable radius model this indicates that the removal of material is more strongly dependent on the surface energy than the addition of material 3 2 particle size evolution the variability in dissolution rate demonstrated by the beaker experiments was further investigated in particle size evolution of a bimodally dispersed suspension the evolution of the nanoparticle size distribution demonstrated an ostwald ripening behaviour as shown in fig 7 equal surface areas of 50 and 150 nm radius particles total silica concentration of 4 99 mm are shown while the initial distribution does not appear bimodal with the significantly higher particle concentration see table 5 of 50 nm particles dominating the bimodal distribution is clearly shown after 24 days further detail is available in the supplementary materials while the nta appears to undercalculate the radius of the larger particle fraction this is reasonable since the analysis parameters selected refer to the supplementary materials for details were optimised to match expected particle concentrations the significantly higher concentration see table 5 of 50 nm particles is therefore skewing the distribution additional optimization for each particle size individually may improve this analysis but at the cost of significantly increasing the analysis time this result shows a clear particle size trend with growth of the larger particles at the expense of the smaller ones our study supports the ostwald ripening hypothesis which has previously been demonstrated for silica nanoparticles lazaro et al 2013 vogelsberger and schmidt 2018 studies of non buffered colloidal silica suspensions have found no evidence of ripening kley et al 2017 3 3 silica model the behaviour of silica nanoparticles is of particular interest if we take into consideration the bricks and mortar nature of the scaling layer in which colloids are the bricks and loosely bound condensed oligomers of silica form the mortar to visualize the silica surface evolution a simplified 2d model based upon variable radius silica equilibrium kinetics was developed this model takes a parametrized 2d surface geometry from which the silica equilibrium table 6 can be solved for each point corresponding with radius of curvature and surface area the new silica concentrations are applied to generate a new silica surface further details and assumptions are discussed in the supplementary materials this model allows visualization of how the surface morphology changes over an extended period and indicates the time period expected for observable morphology changes to become apparent fig 8 shows the modelled start and end points of 50 nm top and 150 nm bottom silica fouling respectively conditions imposed are consistent with the experimental silica equilibrium trials but with a dissolved silica concentration twice the silica saturation 2 0 si to model the concentration polarization at the reverse osmosis membrane surface thompson et al 2017 under these conditions the formation of a smooth surface occurs within between 12 and 30 days the formation of a smooth surfaces fouling layer poses significant issues to long term reverse osmosis the cementing of silica nanoparticles together hinders potential removal decreases cake filtration leading to flux decline and reduces the available surface area for any possible cleaning operations based on the timescales developed in this model of silica scale formation many of the challenges facing long term reverse osmosis operation of silica rich groundwaters are at least partly due to the silica equilibrium and radius of curvature driven morphology changes 3 4 implications based on the silica equilibrium kinetics and subsequent modelling of fouled surfaces there are significant implications for the reverse osmosis of alkaline groundwater the formation of a glassy silica morphology has been previously observed in silica rich alkaline groundwaters salvador cob et al 2012 fig 9 shows several cross sectional se micrographs of ge ae 400 seawater membranes from the final stage stage 3 of a water treatment plant owned by a queensland csg company a significant silica c fouling layer can be observed a with closer examination revealing numerous small glassy regions b the presence of glassy regions in the cross sectional sem images from csg water treatment plants confirms this fouling phenomenon is relevant for csg water chemistry and treatment conditions while this study has focused on the ro fouling of silica rich alkaline groundwaters this behaviour may also be applicable to other colloidal foulants i e sulphur colloids or humic matter or other water sources i e geothermal waters ning et al 2005 tomaszewska and bodzek 2013 in considering the broader implications of this work it should be recognized that reverse osmosis fouling is highly dependent on the feedwater composition and groundwater chemistries around the world can be highly variable greenlee et al 2009 in some cases this water chemistry may even mitigate fouling for example it has been found that small concentrations of humic acid 15 mg l can reduce silica fouling taheri et al 2013 4 conclusion investigation of the silica equilibrium kinetics in alkaline conditions shows that the rate of dissolution is a function of the particle radius with smaller particles having a significantly higher rate this indicates that the surface energy particularly for nanoparticle sized colloidal silica impacts the silica equilibrium these results were confirmed in observations of ostwald ripening behaviour in silica solutions nanoparticle tracking analysis nta was demonstrated to be an ideal tool for studying silica nanoparticle size distributions with clear detection of aggregates and good resolution between bidisperse mixtures further work to optimise the analysis parameters for bidisperse and even polydisperse mixtures could potentially allow further investigation of the behaviour of particle size distributions our results indicate that silica dissolution and redeposition is responsible for the formation of problematic glassy deposits during reverse osmosis of alkaline silica rich groundwaters subsequent 2d modelling of silica surfaces using the equilibrium data reported here shows that formation of smooth surface occurs slowly at a timescale difficult for experimental observation but significant for reverse osmosis operation although oversimplified and missing cross flow hydrodynamic components our model is a first step in predicting the fate of adhered silica nanoparticles it shows a potential development pathway for fouling layer morphology in agreement with electron microscopy evidence of silica rich glassy

silica fouling during groundwater reverse osmosis ro treatment can have a significant impact on filtration performance to better understand this phenomenon the equilibrium kinetics of amorphous colloidal silica were studied at conditions relevant to ro of silica rich alkaline groundwater the impact of particle size was investigated using synthetic monodisperse silica nanoparticles bench scale experiments were conducted by monitoring dissolved silica concentration of aqueous suspensions of colloids of 100 and 300 nm diameter and ph 8 5 to 9 5 the equilibrium data was determined from existing established rate law equations this study concluded that surface energy has a major impact on silica dissolution rate constant particularly for colloidal silica observations of ostwald ripening in bidisperse silica dispersions further confirmed these results which indicate that dissolution and redeposition is responsible for the problematic silica fouling behaviour during ro treatment 2d modelling based on inferred equilibrium data allows visualization of scale layer growth in agreement with cross sectional scanning electron micrographs of autopsied membranes graphical abstract image 1 keywords silica dissolution particle radius of curvature ostwald ripening 1 introduction groundwater desalination is vital for water supply as well as management of water extracted during mining and agricultural activities in many parts of the world reverse osmosis ro membrane separation is widely used for this purpose with the products being desalinated water and brine for example the burgeoning australian coal seam gas csg industry is currently projecting a peak water production of 85 gl year in queensland alone underschultz et al 2018 a significant portion of which is treated by reverse osmosis treatment of such inland brackish groundwaters is often hindered by silica fouling significantly impacting ro performance through increased costs and limited brine minimization lunevich et al 2017 ning 2010 silica fouling is especially problematic as it is difficult to remove and can lead to severe flux decline as silica concentrations reach saturation silica polymerizes and forms colloidal nanoparticles which can deposit on virgin or fouled membranes kley et al 2014 through either aggregation or further polymerization these particles may grow to submicron sizes and are typically observed by sem micrographs as particulate fouling on the membrane surface recent work has captured and characterized these nanoparticles from csg brine donose et al 2017 zaman et al 2015 the time dependent nature of the silica deposit has been noted in numerous studies milne et al 2014 thompson et al 2017 with the central observation being a change in morphology of the fouling layer from particulate to a smooth glassy deposit iler proposed that this fouling rearrangement was a function of the silica solubility equilibrium and the preferential dissolution and re polymerization to minimize the surface energy iler 1979 see fig 1 the formation of a glassy smooth surfaced deposit reduces the available surface area reducing flux and inhibiting effective cleaning silica polymerization and dissolution reactions follow the equilibrium reaction between silicic acid aqueous and silica solid rimstidt et al 2016 1 s i o 4 s 2 h 2 o h 4 s i o 4 a q under alkaline conditions ph 7 5 silicic acid dissociates to a silicate ion 2 h 4 s i o 4 a q h h 3 s i o 4 while these reactions are suitable for describing the bulk reaction rate in a heterogeneous system particularly those involving nanoparticles the contribution of the surface energy should not be overlooked dove et al 2008 the impact of particle surface and radius of curvature on polymerisation and dissolution has previously been studied but without conclusive results fundamentally it is expected the solubility of silica is higher when the surface is convex and lower when it is concave with a smaller radius of curvature having a greater impact but published results have been mixed showing that the dissolution rate for smaller particles either increases goto 1958 decreases diedrich et al 2012 or is independent of particle size rimer et al 2007 this disparity in results could potentially be due to particle aggregation or zeta potential differences particularly above ph 6 overshadowing the effect of particle size diedrich et al 2012 the variability in dissolution rate as a function of curvature is observable as ostwald ripening ostwald 1897 this occurs where smaller more soluble particles preferentially dissolve while dissolved material deposits onto the larger less soluble particles the net result is growth of the larger particles while the smaller particles dissolve while there are many studies of ripening phenomenon of metallic nanoparticles there have been limited observations for silica nanoparticles of note are two studies however those studies were inapplicable to fouling as they were in the presence of either buffers vogelsberger and schmidt 2018 or were for unrelated forms of silica lazaro et al 2013 the relationship between the radius of curvature and silica properties could be critical for understanding and predicting the behavior of colloidal silica particles and their impact on ro operability in this work we investigate 1 the equilibrium kinetics specifically the rates of dissolution and polymerization as a function of the radius of curvature understanding these rates and their potential contribution to observed fouling morphologies may provide insights into flux decline from silica fouling during reverse osmosis 2 the impact of ph on silica solubility typically groundwater exhibits high levels of alkalinity making significant ph variations unviable due to the cost of acid milne et al 2014 however regional differences in the ph of groundwater may be significant in comparing fouling behavior 3 the nanoparticle size evolution in a bimodally dispersed suspension with the view to assessing ostwald ripening phenomenon this phenomenon may be an overlooked contributor to silica fouling 4 how the three previous elements combine to contribute to the morphology of silica fouling both modeled from the experiment data and observed during csg ro membrane autopsies 2 experimental a series of bench scale experiments using aqueous dispersions of synthetic amorphous silica nanoparticles were conducted to establish equilibrium conditions and determine the rates of silica dissolution and polymerization these were performed at a range of phs 8 5 9 5 and particle sizes 50 150 nm radius particle size distributions were monitored at specific time intervals to determine evolution trends and signs of agglomeration 2 1 materials 2 1 1 silica nanoparticles nanocomposix nanoxact 100 nm and 300 nm diameter silica nanospheres were selected for their pure silica composition without any stabilizing agent and monodispersity as shown in table 1 all analysis and modelling was based on the transmission electron microscopy tem reported particles size while in this work we refer to 50 and 150 nm radius particles for simplicity 2 1 2 reagents all reagents used including those for the silicomolybdate method were sourced from sigma aldrich purity 98 all waters were purified using reverse osmosis followed by a mixed bed resin polisher system resulting in a conductivity of 0 052 μs cm 2 2 methods 2 2 1 silica dissolution and polymerisation silica nanoparticle suspensions were stored in 50 ml sterile containers polypropylene and kept in motion on an orbital shaker for the entirety of the experiment which was conducted in a controlled temperature laboratory 23 2 c for more than 60 days the ph was manually maintained during dissolution through addition of minute volumes 20 μl of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide of 10m concentration see table 2 to focus on the impact of the radius of curvature the initial surface area was selected to maintain an equivalent surface area available for mass transfer the particle surface areas was calculated geometrically from the particle size further details are available in the supplementary materials the concentration of reactive silica was observed to initially increase linearly before approaching a stable equilibrium after several weeks 2 2 2 silicomolybdate method the net dissolution of silica nanoparticles was determined by the molybdenum blue method eaton et al 1998 this method is widely used throughout industry and in previous studies of silica dissolution and polymerization kley et al 2014 ning 2010 ammonium molybdate reacts with any reactive silica under acidic conditions to produce the yellow heteropolyacid reactive silica comprises of any monomeric silica including ionized forms and potentially any dissolved dimer ning 2010 through addition of a reducing agent this can be converted to blue species with a significantly higher absorbance suitable for very low concentration samples this paper closely follows the method summarised by kley et al 2017 but converted for a small analytical volume 150 μl to reduce potential variation during the experiment the absorbance of the reduced silicomolybdate species was measured with a hach dr1900 portable spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 815 nm uncertainty in the calibrated silica measurements were determined to be 5 consistent with reported values diedrich et al 2012 2 2 3 ph stabilisation as silica dissolves above ph 7 5 the silicic acid ionizes causing ph reduction to maintain a stable solution ph minute volumes 20 μl of sodium hydroxide were added ph stability improved as the volume of silica dissolving reduced with initial ph adjustments required hourly to maintain ph 0 1 a small salt concentration 0 01 mmol nacl was added to ensure conductivity to improve ph reading accuracy only preparation of a solution with enough buffering capacity was not considered as it would require concentrations that likely alter results significantly salt ions catalyze dissolution and reduce the silica solubility marshall and warakomski 1980 2 2 4 modelling understanding the rates of silica dissolution and polymerization is a complex exercise with varying methods and approaches presented in the literature mazer and walther 1994 to investigate the impact the radius of curvature has on silica equilibrium kinetics two parallel but closely related modelling approaches were applied see fig 2 the first a fixed radius model assumes the radius of curvature does not vary significantly over the course of the trial and focuses on comparing the different particle sizes tested the second modelling approach a variable radius model fits the variation of rate constants with the modified kelvin equation the second modelling approach was adopted after the first approach demonstrated that silica dissolution does vary significantly with particle size and it was based on knowledge that the particles did change size over the course of the experiment as described by the modified kelvin equation decreasing particle size enhances solubility by increasing the surface free energy diedrich et al 2012 3 s s 0 e x p 4 γ v r t d where for a particle diameter d the solubility s is a function of the solubility of a particle of infinite diameter s 0 the surface free energy γ the solid phase molecular volume v gas constant r and temperature t this equation was used to describe the relationship between dissolution rate and surface curvature both from the reduction in particle size during dissolution and the different particle sizes studied to undertake this modeling the silica particles were treated as spheres with constant density and a geometric surface area the validity of these assumptions was verified through determining particle size distributions 2 2 4 1 equilibrium kinetics the rate laws equations 4 and 5 and mass balance equation 6 8 were derived from the silica equilibrium equations 1 and 2 and assuming a pseudo first order reaction icenhower and dove 2000 silica ionization which occurs above ph 7 5 was assumed to be much faster and therefore modeled as instantaneous 4 r d i s s k 1 c s i o 2 5 r p o l y k 2 c h 4 s i o 4 6 d c s i o 2 d t r d i s s r p o l y 7 d c h 4 s i o 4 d t x h 4 s i o 4 r d i s s r p o l y 8 d c h 3 s i o 4 d t 1 x h 4 s i o 4 r d i s s r p o l y where r d i s s and r p o l y refer to the dissolution and polymerization rates and k 1 and k 2 to their respective rate constants equation 6 through 8 describe the change in concentration of the three modelled species over time the silica speciation x h 4 s i o 4 shown as the mole fraction of non ionized silica was modelled through the pitzer equation 2 2 4 2 silica speciation under alkaline conditions silica h4sio4 has four ionizable hydrogens with pka values of 9 9 11 8 12 and 12 respectively ning 2010 at the experimental conditions up to 30 of the dissolved silica may be present in an ionized form fig 3 shows the silica speciation variation with ph for these experimental conditions with vertical lines indicating the three ph values studies table 2 this fraction can be critical as charged ionized species are much more soluble fleming and crerar 1982 but also more prone to precipitation in this case as sodium silicate the speciation of silica present during these experiments was modeled using the pitzer equation in phreeqc charlton and parkhurst 2011 2 2 5 particle size distributions the particle size distributions used in this study were generated using novel nanoparticle tracking analysis nta on the nanosight n300 this technique uses laser light scattering microscopy to identify and track individual nanoparticles diameters from 30 to 1000 nm and calculate the particle size from the observed brownian motion according to the stokes einstein equation filipe et al 2010 this method was selected over the more prevalent dynamic light scattering dls method because of two key advantages firstly nta can easily detect the formation of aggregates formation of these aggregates during the dissolution experiments was identified as a potential risk severely impacting surface area and curvature assumptions since the method is based on individual nanoparticles tracking the presence of aggregates is directly observed tian et al 2016 these same aggregates have a tremendous influence on the results of dls as the intensity of the light scattered is proportional to the sixth power of the particle diameter filipe et al 2010 secondly the nanoparticle tracking analysis is very sensitive to individual particle sizes allowing for better accuracy for polydisperse nanoparticle distributions filipe et al 2010 this accuracy is critical in studying bimodal dispersed nanoparticles for monitoring ostwald ripening while well suited for this application the use of nta does present a unique set of challenges compared to dls based size analysis the sizing is much more time intensive requiring sample handling and dilution and thorough cleaning between samples details of the analytical parameters used for this study are included in the supplementary materials 2 2 6 imaging the morphology of the fouling layer deposited onto the membrane surface was examined by a scanning electron microscope joel 7001 fe sem in back scattered bs and secondary electron se imaging modes freeze liquid nitrogen snapped membranes were imaged and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds surveyed at 10 kv accelerating voltages without further coating 3 results and discussion 3 1 silica dissolution and polymerization a series of beaker experiments were completed to investigate the two particle sizes refer to table 3 for the corresponding conditions and three phs refer to table 2 to focus on the impact of the radius of curvature the initial surface area was selected to maintain an equivalent surface area available for mass transfer the concentration of reactive silica was observed to initially increase linearly before approaching a stable equilibrium after 20 30 days fig 4 3 1 1 silica solubility the observed silica equilibrium reflects the silica solubility which corresponds well with the literature milne et al 2014 solubility values presented in the literature have been derived from a range of silica sources experimental conditions and methods this data confirms that results when using nanocomposix silica nanoparticles align well in terms of composition and dissolution behaviour with other forms of silica used in the literature the experimentally observed solubility of silica varies significantly between ph 8 5 and 9 5 in good agreement with prediction based on the pitzer model see fig 5 3 1 2 silica equilibrium kinetics both silica dissolution and polymerization rate constants k1 and k2 respectively were determined from the batch experiments inspection of the data in table 4 and fig 6 shows that while the dissolution kinetics differ significantly for different particle sizes the polymerization kinetics are relatively unaffected this difference equates to a 3 5 times faster dissolution for 48 nm radius particles relative to the 150 nm radius particles a clear trend is apparent in fig 6 with increasing ph accelerating both the polymerization and dissolution kinetics the equilibrium kinetics derived from these bench scale experiments show a clear increase in dissolution rate for smaller particles this result while consistent with an earlier study of silica dissolution goto 1958 is in disagreement with more recent studies diedrich et al 2012 rimer et al 2007 this disagreement may be attributed to different experimental conditions in fact some other studies data not shown comparing similar concentrations of silica nanoparticles as opposed to the similar surface areas used in this study did not demonstrate significant differences in dissolution kinetics as the results in fig 6 show silica dissolution is clearly affected by the surface energy and as such experiments comparing significantly different surface areas will have errors apparent discrepancies between the data points of the fixed radius model and the fitted curves of the variable radius model are from the different modelling approaches refer to fig 2 the polymerization rate does not appear to be impacted by particle size and hence it has been assumed constant for the variable radius model this indicates that the removal of material is more strongly dependent on the surface energy than the addition of material 3 2 particle size evolution the variability in dissolution rate demonstrated by the beaker experiments was further investigated in particle size evolution of a bimodally dispersed suspension the evolution of the nanoparticle size distribution demonstrated an ostwald ripening behaviour as shown in fig 7 equal surface areas of 50 and 150 nm radius particles total silica concentration of 4 99 mm are shown while the initial distribution does not appear bimodal with the significantly higher particle concentration see table 5 of 50 nm particles dominating the bimodal distribution is clearly shown after 24 days further detail is available in the supplementary materials while the nta appears to undercalculate the radius of the larger particle fraction this is reasonable since the analysis parameters selected refer to the supplementary materials for details were optimised to match expected particle concentrations the significantly higher concentration see table 5 of 50 nm particles is therefore skewing the distribution additional optimization for each particle size individually may improve this analysis but at the cost of significantly increasing the analysis time this result shows a clear particle size trend with growth of the larger particles at the expense of the smaller ones our study supports the ostwald ripening hypothesis which has previously been demonstrated for silica nanoparticles lazaro et al 2013 vogelsberger and schmidt 2018 studies of non buffered colloidal silica suspensions have found no evidence of ripening kley et al 2017 3 3 silica model the behaviour of silica nanoparticles is of particular interest if we take into consideration the bricks and mortar nature of the scaling layer in which colloids are the bricks and loosely bound condensed oligomers of silica form the mortar to visualize the silica surface evolution a simplified 2d model based upon variable radius silica equilibrium kinetics was developed this model takes a parametrized 2d surface geometry from which the silica equilibrium table 6 can be solved for each point corresponding with radius of curvature and surface area the new silica concentrations are applied to generate a new silica surface further details and assumptions are discussed in the supplementary materials this model allows visualization of how the surface morphology changes over an extended period and indicates the time period expected for observable morphology changes to become apparent fig 8 shows the modelled start and end points of 50 nm top and 150 nm bottom silica fouling respectively conditions imposed are consistent with the experimental silica equilibrium trials but with a dissolved silica concentration twice the silica saturation 2 0 si to model the concentration polarization at the reverse osmosis membrane surface thompson et al 2017 under these conditions the formation of a smooth surface occurs within between 12 and 30 days the formation of a smooth surfaces fouling layer poses significant issues to long term reverse osmosis the cementing of silica nanoparticles together hinders potential removal decreases cake filtration leading to flux decline and reduces the available surface area for any possible cleaning operations based on the timescales developed in this model of silica scale formation many of the challenges facing long term reverse osmosis operation of silica rich groundwaters are at least partly due to the silica equilibrium and radius of curvature driven morphology changes 3 4 implications based on the silica equilibrium kinetics and subsequent modelling of fouled surfaces there are significant implications for the reverse osmosis of alkaline groundwater the formation of a glassy silica morphology has been previously observed in silica rich alkaline groundwaters salvador cob et al 2012 fig 9 shows several cross sectional se micrographs of ge ae 400 seawater membranes from the final stage stage 3 of a water treatment plant owned by a queensland csg company a significant silica c fouling layer can be observed a with closer examination revealing numerous small glassy regions b the presence of glassy regions in the cross sectional sem images from csg water treatment plants confirms this fouling phenomenon is relevant for csg water chemistry and treatment conditions while this study has focused on the ro fouling of silica rich alkaline groundwaters this behaviour may also be applicable to other colloidal foulants i e sulphur colloids or humic matter or other water sources i e geothermal waters ning et al 2005 tomaszewska and bodzek 2013 in considering the broader implications of this work it should be recognized that reverse osmosis fouling is highly dependent on the feedwater composition and groundwater chemistries around the world can be highly variable greenlee et al 2009 in some cases this water chemistry may even mitigate fouling for example it has been found that small concentrations of humic acid 15 mg l can reduce silica fouling taheri et al 2013 4 conclusion investigation of the silica equilibrium kinetics in alkaline conditions shows that the rate of dissolution is a function of the particle radius with smaller particles having a significantly higher rate this indicates that the surface energy particularly for nanoparticle sized colloidal silica impacts the silica equilibrium these results were confirmed in observations of ostwald ripening behaviour in silica solutions nanoparticle tracking analysis nta was demonstrated to be an ideal tool for studying silica nanoparticle size distributions with clear detection of aggregates and good resolution between bidisperse mixtures further work to optimise the analysis parameters for bidisperse and even polydisperse mixtures could potentially allow further investigation of the behaviour of particle size distributions our results indicate that silica dissolution and redeposition is responsible for the formation of problematic glassy deposits during reverse osmosis of alkaline silica rich groundwaters subsequent 2d modelling of silica surfaces using the equilibrium data reported here shows that formation of smooth surface occurs slowly at a timescale difficult for experimental observation but significant for reverse osmosis operation although oversimplified and missing cross flow hydrodynamic components our model is a first step in predicting the fate of adhered silica nanoparticles it shows a potential development pathway for fouling layer morphology in agreement with electron microscopy evidence of silica rich glassy

18403,the formation and occurrence of haloacetonitriles hans in drinking water is of increasing concern because recent data have shown that they are the major contributors to dbp associated toxicity of disinfected waters earlier research on han formation had established free amino acids as important han precursors due to their high reactivity with chlorine however free amino acids are unlikely to be the primary precursors for hans in natural waters mainly because the actual concentrations of these compounds are too low to sufficiently account for observed han formation on the other hand combined amino acids i e peptides and proteins are of much higher abundance even though it is unclear if they can contribute to han formation given that nearly all the amino nitrogen is tied up in peptide linkages in order to clarify the reactivity of combined amino acids with chlorine to form hans dichloroacetonitrile dcan formation kinetics was compared between free aspartic acid and two aspartyl containing tetrapeptides i e asp asp asp asp and arg gly asp ser results indicated that aspartyl residue could also lead to dcan formation upon chlorination whereas the rate of dcan formation was much slower compared to that from free aspartic acid chlorination moreover dcan formation from the two model peptides was catalyzed by high ph this is because chlorine induced peptide backbone degradation is the key to dcan formation from the chlorination of combined amino acids and this slow stepwise process is base catalyzed perhaps most importantly regardless of the precursors dcan was continuously formed but simultaneously degraded especially at alkaline phs leaving the corresponding n chloro 2 2 dichloroacetamide n cl dcam and dichloroacetic acid dcaa as major end products it was observed that over increasing chlorine exposure there exists an important transition from initial organic precursors through metastable chlorination intermediates e g dcan and n cl dcam and finally to stable end products e g dcaa by weighting dbp concentrations by their respective cytotoxic potencies it is estimated that the aggregate cytotoxicity of chlorinated water would reach its maximum at relatively short chlorine contact times in general shorter water age and lower ph both resulted in higher levels of metastable intermediates i e dcan and thus higher levels of aggregate calculated cytotoxicity the resulting toxicity profile is different from the prevailing notion that supports current dbp regulations therefore there is a risk that by placing regulatory limits and control strategies exclusively on regulated end products e g haas the overall toxicity of drinking water might be inadvertently elevated graphical abstract image 1 keywords haloacetonitriles metastable disinfection byproducts drinking water safety amino acids peptides 1 introduction haloacetonitriles hans were first recognized as byproducts of chlorination of certain amino acids namely aspartic acid tryptophan tyrosine histidine and kynurenine under conditions of excess chlorine trehy and bieber 1981 ueno et al 1996 earlier literature indicated that nitrile formation is characteristic of amino acid chlorination when the first stage in the reaction is featured by the formation of a dichloroamino acid dakin 1916 in the case of aspartic acid for example the amino acid can be oxidized to dichloroacetonitrile dcan via the nitrile pathway fig s1 trehy and bieber 1981 trehy et al 1986 peters et al 1990 hureiki et al 1994 deborde and von gunten 2008 chu et al 2010 shah and mitch 2011 bond et al 2012 chlorination of the α amino nitrogen first leads to the formation of n n dichloroaspartic acid subsequent decarboxylation of this dichloramine forms an n chloroaldimine which further dehydrohalogenates i e elimination of hydrochloric acid to yield the cyanoacetic acid due to combined electron withdrawing effect from both the carboxylic acid group and the nitrile group the methylene carbon in cyanoacetic acid is very acidic such that dichlorination coupled with decarboxylation of this reaction intermediate ultimately results in dcan formation despite the general acknowledgement that free amino acids such as aspartic acid reacts quickly with excess chlorine leading to very rapid nitrile formation alouini and seux 1987 they are unlikely to be the primary han precursors in surface waters this is because free amino acids only account for a very small fraction 4 10 of total dissolved amino acids peake et al 1972 lytle and perdue 1981 dotson and westerhoff 2009 and thus their concentrations are insufficient to account for the observed han occurrence in drinking waters moreover the specific formation of hans instead of other nitriles depends on the amino acid precursor structure and requires the presence of activating groups e g aromatic rings on the other hand approximately 60 of dissolved amino acids in natural waters are bound within biological macromolecules e g proteins or peptides and another 20 are associated with humic substances tuschall and brezonik 1980 thurman 1985 therefore those combined amino acids are up to four to five times as abundant as the free forms hureiki et al 1994 thurman 1985 and they may be the most likely precursor pool for hans in surface waters although combined amino acids are of relatively high abundance uncertainty remains regarding their reactivity with halogenating agents e g chlorine or chloramines and thus their potential contribution to han formation as is apparent in fig s1 the presence of a primary amine group in aspartic acid is pivotal to the final formation of dcan since the initial step of amino acid chlorination is the attack of chlorine on amine nitrogen to form an organic n chloramine in contrast to the case of free amino acids the majority of amino nitrogen in combined amino acids is tied up in amide peptide linkages and therefore is orders of magnitude less reactive than amine nitrogen hawkins and davies 1999 in fact many have proposed that amide nitrogen in peptide bonds is unreactive with aqueous chlorine pereira et al 1973 hureiki et al 1994 due to the absence of a primary amine group it is likely that a bonded aspartyl residue will not be as reactive as free aspartic acid with chlorine to form the corresponding dcan on the contrary there is evidence that peptide bonds can undergo slow degradation in a stepwise fashion in the presence of chlorine goldschmidt et al 1927 keefe et al 1997 fox et al 1997 and han formation can be interpreted as a result of such chlorine induced peptide degradation bieber and trehy 1983 for these reasons it is unclear if there is substantial reaction between chlorine and amino nitrogen in combined amino acids and if yields of hans from specific amino acid monomers e g aspartic acid histidine tryptophan and tyrosine as prolific han producers are significant enough so that the role of combined amino acids as primary han precursors can be justified moreover it is well recognized that hans are unlike trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acid haas which are among the most chemically stable end products of the reaction between chlorine and natural organic matter nom instead hans are metastable intermediates that fall along the trajectory between nom and haas and thus their instantaneous yields are dually dependent on the reaction kinetics of both their continuous formation and their simultaneous degradation reckhow et al 2001 however the amount of han lost due to its in situ degradation has been greatly overlooked in previous han formation studies perhaps most importantly as hans degrade they leave other dpbs in their place peters et al 1990 glezer et al 1999 reckhow et al 2001 yu and reckhow 2015 2017 in the case of dcan it can undergo base catalyzed hydrolysis forming the corresponding 2 2 dichloroacetamide dcam as an intermediate and further dcam hydrolysis will leads to dichloroacetic acid dcaa formation as a stable end product glezer et al 1999 reckhow et al 2001 yu and reckhow 2015 in actual drinking water containing a free chlorine residual dcan can be chlorinated rather rapidly to form another nitrogenous dbp the n chloro 2 2 dichloroacetamide n cl dcam under relatively alkaline ph conditions i e 7 ph 9 yu and reckhow 2017 alternatively n cl dcam can be formed via a hypochlorite catalyzed dcan hydrolysis pathway fig 3 yu and reckhow 2017 once formed n cl dcam tends to deprotonate fig 3 due to its low pka value i e p k a n c l d c a m 3 71 menard and lessard 1978 and the anionic form of n cl dcam has been demonstrated to be very stable and thus persistent in chlorinated drinking waters yu and reckhow 2017 as an organic chloramine n cl dcam has been shown to be more toxicologically potent than previously misidentified dcam vu et al 2018 bull et al 2011 and therefore may pose higher carcinogenic risks to drinking water consumers this transition from initial hans through degradation intermediates i e haloacetamides and n chloro haloacetamides and finally to regulated end products i e haas is fundamentally different from our understanding of dbp behavior pertaining to regulated compounds since the discovery of thms and haas as byproducts of drinking water disinfection considerable efforts have been focused on characterizing the formation of those two classes of dbps from the chlorination of model organic compounds aquatic humic and fulvic acids and raw drinking waters showing an almost exclusive monotonic increase in their formation with increasing chlorine contact time and chlorine dose reckhow and singer 1985 because thms and haas are subject of current regulation control strategies have mainly focused on minimizing their formation and therefore are reliant on their formation chemistry for example regulatory drivers encourage utilities to distribute water that is of shorter water age concurrently an increasing number of utilities are switching away from the sole reliance on chlorine disinfection to combinations of primary disinfectants with chloramines as secondary disinfectants seidel et al 2005 li and mitch 2018 taken together the end result is often higher levels of metastable intermediates such as hans in those less highly chlorinated waters blank et al 2002 perhaps most importantly when dbp concentrations were weighted by measures of their toxic potencies e g chinese hamster ovary cell cytotoxicity and genotoxicity hans have been shown to be the primary toxicity drivers in different types of disinfected water muellner et al 2007 wagner and plewa 2017 zeng et al 2016 chuang and mitch 2017 krasner et al 2016 plewa et al 2017 therefore there is a risk that the application of those aforementioned control strategies is inadvertently pushing the overall toxicity of drinking water to an elevated level by focusing solely on end products i e thms and haas and excluding reactive chlorination intermediates such as hans the purpose of this study was to compare the reactivity of free amino acids with that of combined amino acids in terms of han formation under a range of ph conditions so as to clarify the reactivity of polypeptides with aqueous chlorine since monochloramine is a weaker and slower acting disinfectant than free chlorine chlorine transfer from monochloramine to nitrogenous organic precursors will be at a much slower rate hureiki et al 1994 isaac and morris 1985 therefore chloramination of polypeptides is unlikely the predominant pathway to han formation when monochloramine is employed as a secondary disinfectant furthermore monochloramine can be an additional nitrogen source and produces hans even when the organic precursors are non nitrogenous nihemaiti et al 2016 thus complicating the elucidation of the role of bonded amino nitrogen in han formation due to these two reasons only the reactions between free chlorine and amino acids were investigated in this study two tetrapeptides i e asp asp asp asp and arg gly asp ser were selected as model precursors and the chlorination reaction of combined aspartyl residue was compared to that of free aspartic acid in terms of dcan formation kinetics a second objective of this study was to quantify the compensatory formation of n cl dcam and dcaa as dcan degradation products and to assess if the discrepancy between anticipated dcan formation and its observed concentrations can be accounted for by the formation of those two secondary dbps another key objective was to project temporal toxicity profiles by weighting measured dbp concentrations by their corresponding toxic potencies to evaluate the contribution of metastable dbps e g hans to the dbp associated toxicity of drinking water as a function of water age 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection of model peptides of all the free amino acids aspartic acid has been demonstrated to be the most prolific dcan producer when treated with excess chlorine trehy and bieber 1981 bieber and trehy 1983 bond et al 2014 given the comparison to be made in this study the presence of at least one aspartyl residue was used as an essential criterion for the selection of a model peptide for this reason two tetrapeptides that contain different numbers of aspartyl residues were chosen tetraaspartic acid i e asp asp asp asp is the simplest aspartyl containing peptide that is commercially available the other aspartyl containing peptide selected was arg gly asp ser for the following two reasons first unlike asp asp asp asp which contains four aspartyl residues with one starting at the n terminal arg gly asp ser is composed of only one available aspartyl residue in the middle of the peptide backbone and thus may not lead to dcan formation if this bonded aspartyl residue is not reactive with chlorine second other nitriles may also be produced from the chlorination of arginine glycine and serine monomers but dcan formation will be specific only to the aspartyl residue 2 2 chemicals and reagents l aspartic acid reagent grade 98 asp asp asp asp 97 arg gly asp ser 95 and all dbp standard compounds including dichloroacetonitrile dcan dichloroacetamide dcam and dichloroacetic acid dcaa were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo general laboratory chemicals and organic solvents were supplied by fisher scientific pittsburgh pa and were of acs grade unless otherwise noted purified n chloro 2 2 dichloroacetamide n cl dcam standard compound is not commercially available therefore this compound was prepared by reacting an equal stoichiometric amount of free chlorine with the corresponding dcam cl2 n 1 1 with ph of both solutions adjusted to 9 0 before mixing the formation of n cl dcam in the

a preceding paper by the authors yu and reckhow 2017 2 3 experimental conditions all reaction solutions were prepared in ultrapure milli q water emd millipore corp containing 10mm phosphate buffer and were adjusted to the desired phs using either sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid at the start of each chlorination experiment a pre determined amount of an individual model compound was introduced

conducted by adding a small volume of acidified sodium hypochlorite solution to each buffered precursor containing solution so that the initial chlorine concentration was 15 mg l as cl2 211 μm as cl2 based on preliminary calculations of chlorine demand hureiki et al 1994 the precursor concentrations and initial chlorine dose were determined as such that regardless if aspartic acid is in the free or combined form this amino acid would be exposed to relatively the same amount of chlorine residual over reaction time i e same chlorine exposure or ct immediately after the introduction of chlorine samples were partitioned off into 300 ml bod bottles with no headspace and were stored in a dark 20 c incubator for the prescribed reaction times at each reaction time one bottle of sample was sacrificed and analyzed instantaneously for residual chlorine and dbp concentrations in this study all measurements were made in duplicates to account for analytical uncertainties 2 4 sample preparation and dbp analysis after the prescribed chlorine contact time residual chlorine in each sample was quenched by 25 mg l ammonium chloride the use ammonium chloride as the quenching agent was to prevent formed n cl dcam from being reduced to the corresponding dcam yu and reckhow 2017 more importantly all sample extractions were performed immediately after quenching to minimize the potential inference from the formation of monochloramine dcan was quantified using a slightly modified version of the epa method 551 1 to prevent formed dcan from base catalyzed hydrolysis yu and reckhow 2015 during sample preparation 20 ml aliquots of quenched sample were acidified to ph 6 using hydrochloric acid followed by liquid liquid extraction using 4 ml of pentane with an internal

prior to sample loading each cartridge was conditioned by 3 ml of methanol followed by one wash using 3 ml of ultrapure milli q water thereafter each sample 100 ml was drawn through the cartridge under vacuum at a flow rate of approximately 1 ml min after sample loading the cartridges were washed with 2 ml of methanol nh4oh v v 95 5 and subsequently n cl dcam was eluted with 2 ml of

retention time of n cl dcam is 1 289 min and its method detection limit is 0 90 μg l 2 5 calculation of dbp associated cytotoxicity the cytotoxicity of measured dbps i e dcan n cl dcam and dcaa was calculated by dividing measured concentrations by published cytotoxic potencies potencies for individual dbps were determined based on the in vitro chinese hamster ovary cho cell assay which are concentrations of individual dbps that induced a 50 reduction in cell density over a 72 h period compared to the negative controls i e lc50 values in molar units lc50 values for dcan n cl dcam and dcaa are 5 73 10 5 m 3 90 10 4 m and 7 30 10 3 m wagner and plewa 2017 vu et al 2018 respectively indicating a decrease in toxic potencies along the dcan degradation pathway the aggregate toxicity profiles were projected as a function of reaction time by summing the calculated cytotoxicity for each dbp assuming they are linearly additive 3 results and discussions 3 1 kinetic dcan formation during the chlorination of free aspartic acid to evaluate the reactivity of free aspartic acid in terms of dcan formation a chlorination study of buffered aspartic acid solutions was conducted under four ph conditions i e ph 6 7 8 and 9 with excess chlorine cl2 asp 10 1 μm μm in each case the amount of dcan formed was quantified over reaction time from a few hours to a total of two weeks fig 1 shows the individual dcan formation profiles at each of the four phs in general observed dcan concentrations did not follow a monotonic increasing trend with increasing reaction time instead dcan concentration reached a maximum between 12 and 48 h and significantly decreased at longer reaction times under all ph conditions in addition dcan concentrations were consistently lower when chlorination was conducted at higher phs this actual decrease in dcan concentration over time is clear evidence of simultaneous dcan degradation to its continuous formation therefore it is necessary to determine the amount of dcan that was initially formed but subsequently degraded because cumulative dcan formation if there was no dcan decomposition may be substantially greater than its instantaneously measured amount in a previous study by the authors yu and reckhow 2015 dcan degradation kinetics was fully characterized its degradation rate can be described by equation 1 which reflects simultaneous dcan reactions with neutral water hydroxide i e oh and hypochlorite i e ocl as major reactive constituents in chlorinated waters 1 d d c a n d t k h 2 o d c a n k o h o h d c a n k o c l o c l d c a n in equation 1 k h 2 o and k o h are the neutral and base catalyzed hydrolysis rate constants and k o c l is the hypochlorite chlorination rate constant the three rate constants are estimated to be 1 68 1 02 10 4 hr 1 5 60 0 31 103m 1hr 1 and 6 85 0 45 102m 1hr 1 respectively yu and reckhow 2015 since free chlorine residual rather than hypochlorite concentrations are often that can be measured equation 1 was reformulated into equation 2 using the hypochlorous acid dissociation constant i e k a hocl 10 7 582 at 20 c morris 1966 so that hypochlorite concentration can be expressed in the form of a fraction of total free chlorine concentration i e c t at any given ph 2 d d c a n d t k h 2 o k o h o h k o c l α 1 c t d c a n 3 α 1 k a h o c l k a h o c l h when both dcan and residual free chlorine concentrations are monitored as a function of reaction time fig 1 and fig s2 the amount of dcan that decomposed in a discretized time step from t to t 1 can be quantitatively determined using equation 4 where intermediate dcan and residual free chlorine concentrations are approximated by linear interpolation i e d c a n t d c a n t 1 2 and c t t c t t 1 2 4 δ d c a n k h 2 o k o h o h k o c l α 1 c t t c t t 1 2 d c a n t d c a n t 1 2 δ t the cumulative dcan formation denoted as d c a n f can be calculated according to equation 5 through a stepwise

i n i t i a l c o n d i t i o n d c a n f t t 0 0 it is noteworthy that both dcan and residual free chlorine concentrations need to be quantified at relative high frequencies to minimize the time intervals between t and t 1 ensuring the robustness of the estimated intermediate dcan and residual free chlorine concentrations via linear interpolation results of this calculation are presented by the dashed lines in fig 1 it is clear from fig 1 that near quantitative amounts of dcan were initially formed but subsequently degraded during the chlorination of free aspartic acid after 96 h i e 4 days a maximum of about 90 of total aspartic acid was converted into dcan at ph 6 and this cumulative dcan formation leveled off over longer periods of time this compares with about 97 100 and 100 maximum cumulative dcan formation at ph 7 8 and 9 respectively in contrast to prior reports that nitrile formation from amino acid chlorination is favored by low ph trehy 1980 alouini and seux 1987 the calculated cumulative dcan formation i e dashed lines in fig 1 suggests that aspartic acid has an equal or greater tendency to form dcan under more alkaline ph conditions i e ph 7 in the presence of excess chlorine based on these data we propose that the reaction between aspartic acid and chlorine proceeds to completion almost entirely via the nitrile pathway fig s1 at both ph 8 and ph 9 as cumulative dcan formation reached 100 however accelerated dcan degradation at higher phs reckhow et al 2001 yu and reckhow 2015 resulted in more extensive dcan decomposition and thus less amount of dcan measured taken together the amount of dcan formed during aspartic acid chlorination at higher phs may be greater even though the measured concentrations were significantly lower due to its higher rate of degradation this discrepancy between cumulative dcan formation and observed or measured dcan concentration may explain why previously reported dcan yields from the chlorination of free aspartic acid are highly variable ranging from 0 01 to 11 1 at ph 7 with reaction times differing from hours to days trehy et al 1986 ueno et al 1996 yang et al 2012 bond et al 2014 disparate chlorination protocols applied across different studies that varied in chlorine exposure might have resulted in different extents of dcan degradation lastly fig 1 shows that the rate of cumulative dcan formation is nearly independent of ph as dcan formation profiles followed the same trajectory at all four phs i e ph 6 9 this is indicative of very rapid initial reactions between free aspartic acid and chlorine to form the n chloroaspartic acid and then n n dichloroaspartic acid likely on a timescale of seconds to minutes alouini and seux 1987 as a result the rate limiting step for dcan formation through the nitrile pathway is no longer ph dependent or chlorine concentration dependent instead dehydrohalogenation of the n chloroaldimine fig s1 is a good candidate for the rate limiting step in dcan formation as n chloroaldimines are reported to be relatively stable in the presence of a free chlorine residual nweke and scully 1989 3 2 n cl dcam and dcaa formation as a result of dcan degradation as demonstrated above large quantities of dcan initially formed but subsequently degraded over the course of free aspartic acid chlorination therefore it is necessary to consider what secondary degradation products were formed and which of these products would predominate under relevant ph conditions in a prior study n cl dcam and dcaa were found to be the major dcan degradation products in chlorinated drinking waters yu and reckhow 2017 for this reason these two compounds were quantified at each reaction time and a mass balance was determined regarding the amount of dcan decomposed and the amount of n cl dcam and dcaa formed it needs to be noted that the formation of dcam was not observed in this experiment since dcam does not persist in the presence of free chlorine due to its rapid reaction with hypochlorite to form the n cl dcam via a n chlorination pathway yu and reckhow 2017 fig 2 shows the measured concentrations of dcan n cl dcam and dcaa along with the calculated cumulative dcan formation under all four ph conditions in general appreciable amounts of n cl dcam and dcaa were formed which almost fully accounted for the amount of dcan degraded especially at higher phs i e ph 8 and ph 9 this is supported by the calculated aggregate molar concentrations of dcan n cl dcam and dcaa as presented in fig 2 i e purple diamonds which followed the same trends as the amount of dcan predicted to have formed i e d c a n f however there exists a small but noticeable discrepancy between those two calculated values at ph 6 and ph 7 over long periods of reaction time which might be attributed to the formation of some other reaction intermediates that were not identified or quantified in this study the concentration of n cl dcam increased not only with increasing reaction time but also with increasing ph at lower phs i e ph 6 and ph 7 n cl dcam was barely measurable when ph was increased to 8 its formation became much more substantial and reached a maximum molar yield of 45 at 48 h followed by a slight decrease at longer reaction times more n cl dcam was formed at ph 9 and its molar yield reached a maximum of 62 at 48 h and leveled off thereafter these trends are in agreement with our latest understanding of the ph impacts on n cl dcam formation and stability in brief high ph favors n cl dcam formation and inhibits its decomposition yu and reckhow 2017 on the other hand dcaa concentration exhibited an overall monotonic increase with time but a significant decrease with ph when it was above 7 this is because dcan degrades to form dcaa mainly through an acid catalyzed n cl dcam chlorination pathway fig 3 yu and reckhow 2017 under neutral or slightly acidic ph conditions n cl dcam degradation was accelerated so that dcaa became the predominant dcan degradation product and accounted for the majority amount of dcan decomposed at ph 6 least amount of dcan was degraded over time compared to the other three higher phs as a result least amount of dcaa was formed it should be noted that a considerable amount of dcaa was still formed at ph 8 and 9 even when the intermediate n cl dcam did not significantly degrade fig 2 this is indicative of the existence of another dcaa formation pathway that is independent of acid catalyzed n cl dcam chlorination since the sum of the amount of n cl dcam and dcaa formed equals the amount of dcan degraded this dcaa formation at ph 8 and 9 is therefore still a result of dcan degradation based on these facts a new dcaa formation pathway was proposed as shown in fig 3 in this pathway dcan undergoes sequential reactions with hydroxide and hypochlorite to form the n chloro 2 2 dichloroethane 1 1 diol which is a hydroxyl adduct of n cl dcam further hydrolysis of this adduct eventually forms dcaa due to the specific participation of both hydroxide and hypochlorite this reaction is presumed to be base catalyzed and thus was observed only under alkaline ph conditions i e ph 8 and 9 in this experiment 3 3 dcan formation during the chlorination of combined aspartic acid chemistry of peptide chlorination as discussed earlier free aspartic acid is very reactive with aqueous chlorine forming large quantities of dcan that are subsequently degraded in contrast given the same reaction time and ph the bonded aspartic acid monomer in either asp asp asp asp or arg gly asp ser produced approximately one order of magnitude less dcan compared to free aspartic acid fig s3 for instance measured dcan concentrations per aspartyl residue were 4 and 0 9 at ph 8 after 24 h of chlorination of asp asp asp asp and arg gly asp ser respectively this compares to a measured dcan molar yield of 27 from the chlorination of free aspartic acid under the same conditions following the same trend as free aspartic acid combined aspartic acid led to greater initial dcan formation i e d c a n f at higher phs even though the amount of dcan degraded was also more substantial this is indicated by a significant increase in the discrepancy i e δ d c a n shown in fig 4 between measured and calculated dcan formation with increasing ph in addition the rate of dcan formation was also faster at higher phs during the chlorination of both tetrapeptides fig s3 this is different from dcan formation from free aspartic acid chlorination where its formation rate was nearly independent of reaction ph fig 1 taken all together it is clear that combined aspartic acid resulted in much slower dcan formation than did free aspartic acid under the same chlorine exposure fig s2 and ph conditions and its reactions with chlorine are subject to base catalysis this supports our hypothesized mechanistic rationale that chlorine induced peptide degradation might be the key to nitrile formation from combined amino acids since peptide bond degradation is also known to be a slow and base catalyzed process bieber and trehy 1983 fig 5 shows the proposed mechanisms for the formation of dcan during the chlorination of a generic peptide although bonded amide nitrogen in peptide linkages may not be directly reactive with aqueous chlorine pereira et al 1973 hureiki et al 1994 the unprotected free amine group of the n terminal amino acid can still be chlorinated in the same way as the α amine group of its free form leading to the formation of an n n dichloramine under conditions of excess chlorine if a peptide possesses an aspartyl residue at the n terminal end chlorination of this peptide will first lead to the formation of a combined n n dichloroaspartic acid fig 5 instead of undergoing a decarboxylation reaction like the free n n dichloroaspartic acid fig s1 this combined dichloramine is subject to dehydrohalogenation to yield a combined n chloroaldimine subsequent dehydrohalogenation of the n chloroaldimine coupled with c c bond cleavage frees a cyanoacetic acid from the peptide backbone and yields an isocyanate the resulting cyanoacetic acid reacts quickly with chlorine leading to final dcan formation via dichlorination and decarboxylation fig 5 perhaps most importantly hydrolysis of the isocyanate will generate a new free amine group as the n terminus for the remaining peptide keefe et al 1997 fox et al 1997 so that the same set of chlorination reactions can proceed onto the next amino acid monomer as a result the peptide will be degraded by excess chlorine in a slow stepwise fashion goldschmidt et al 1927 bieber and trehy 1983 keefe et al 1997 fox et al 1997 and dcan can be produced at any point when the remaining peptide contains an n terminal aspartyl residue in conclusion the availability of a free amine group at the n terminal end is essential to the chlorine induced base catalyzed peptide degradation sequence fig 5 and dcan formation is a result of such stepwise reactions when certain reactive n terminal amino acid monomers e g aspartyl residue are cleaved off the peptide backbone however we recognize that there are likely many other parallel reaction pathways and the development of a full scheme of peptide chlorination reaction pathways is outside of the scope of this work since peptide backbone is degraded by chlorine in a stepwise manner every aspartic acid monomer will form dcan at a different rate depending on its order in the peptide sequence the closer an aspartyl residue is located to the c terminal end the slower is the formation of dcan from this residue this is because its bonded amide nitrogen will not be accessible to aqueous chlorine until all prior amino acid residues are sequentially degraded to render this nitrogen free in contrast due to the possession of an unprotected free amine nitrogen the n terminal aspartyl residue can be chlorinated most readily to form dcan for this reason the rate of dcan formation from the four aspartyl residues in asp asp asp asp should follow a decreasing order from the first to the fourth and the apparent dcan formation rate shown by dashed lines in fig 4 should be interpreted as an averaged rate from the four monomers compared to asp asp asp asp arg gly asp ser contains only one aspartyl residue next to the c terminus so that dcan formation from this tetrapeptide is expected to be much slower this is because dcan formation from this peptide is controlled by the rate at which arginine and glycine residues are removed from the peptide backbone as is clear in figs 4 and s3 the calculated cumulative dcan formation profiles i e d c a n f are in good alignment with those anticipated trends with the rate of dcan formation per aspartyl residue from asp asp asp asp being faster than its formation from arg gly asp ser the proposed mechanisms for the formation of dcan from the chlorination of those two tetrapeptides are shown in figs s4 and s5 3 4 kinetics of n cl dcam and dcaa formation during the chlorination of asp asp asp asp and arg gly asp ser in this experiment the formation of n cl dcam and dcaa was also monitored over the course of asp asp asp asp and arg gly asp ser chlorination to examine their relations to dcan it is evident in fig 6 that n cl dcam formation followed many of the same trends as noted during free aspartic acid chlorination when ph was below or equal to neutral the amount of n cl dcam formed was almost trivial this is attributable to an overall low dcan yield from both tetrapeptides under relatively acidic ph conditions i e maximum cumulative dcan formation 10 when chlorine induced peptide degradation is suppressed in addition dcan is less susceptible to degradation by hypochlorite to form n cl dcam at low phs yu and reckhow 2015 2017 at ph 8 n cl dcam concentration profiles were characterized by an initial accumulation reaching a maximum followed by a slight decrease over longer reaction times similar to the case of free aspartic acid n cl dcam formation from both asp asp asp asp and arg gly asp ser was pronounced at ph 9 and exhibited a monotonic increase with increasing reaction time compared to n cl dcam chlorination of both tetrapeptides formed much greater amounts of dcaa under most ph conditions more importantly dcaa concentrations were consistently higher than the amounts of dcan predicted to have formed during the chlorination of arg gly asp ser moreover dcaa formation was much faster than that of dcan regardless of reaction ph this substantial deviation from the expected dcaa formation profile is suggestive of the existence of some other dcaa formation pathways in addition to the three summarized in fig 3 which are dependent solely on dcan decomposition as proposed in the literature reckhow et al 2001 bieber and trehy 1983 the attack of chlorine on proteinaceous precursors can be interpreted as a two step process electron rich side groups first undergo relatively rapid reactions with chlorine to give rise to fast chlorine demand and formation of chlorinated dbps e g thms and haas hureiki et al 1994 under conditions of excess chlorine the peptide backbone then degrades slowly in a stepwise fashion goldschmidt et al 1927 bieber and trehy 1983 resulting in dihaloacetonitrile dhan formation therefore it is chemically plausible that dcaa was derived mainly from amino acid side chains during the chlorination of arg gly asp ser although a more fundamental understanding of the side group chlorination mechanisms requires more detailed work in the future 3 5 implications with respect to dbp associated toxicity of drinking water and dbp regulations fig 7 presents the calculated cytotoxicity as a function of reaction time and ph for each of the three model precursors by weighting measured dbp concentrations data shown in figs 2 and 6 by their cytotoxic potencies reported in the literature wagner and plewa 2017 vu et al 2018 since dcan lc50 dcan 5 73 10 5 m is one and two orders of magnitude more potent than n cl dcam and dcaa respectively lc50 n cl dcam 3 90 10 4 m lc50 dcaa 7 30 10 3 m the calculated aggregate cytotoxicity i e sum of the calculated cytotoxicity for each dbp was driven predominantly by dcan for this reason at higher phs and longer reaction times when dcan concentration profiles were mainly characterized by its degradation there was a substantial decrease in calculated aggregate cytotoxicity it is important to note that at ph 9 as dcan quickly degraded to below detection limit in 24 h the decrease in calculated aggregate cytotoxicity was offset by the formation of n cl dcam which became the dominant calculated cytotoxicity contributor over long periods of time a similar offsetting phenomenon was also observed at ph 8 whereas n cl dcam contributed to a lesser extent to the calculated aggregate cytotoxicity compared to ph 9 as is expected the contribution of dcaa to the calculated aggregate cytotoxicity was generally negligible even though it accounted for a relatively large portion of formed dbps on a mass basis especially in the case of asp asp asp asp and arg gly asp ser chlorination fig 6 most importantly the calculated aggregate cytotoxicity exhibited similar trends over increasing reaction time during the chlorination of the three organic model precursors regardless of whether aspartic acid was free or combined calculated aggregate cytotoxicity of these chlorinated waters all started from zero with non toxic organic precursors i e free amino acids or peptides and increased rapidly as dcan formed with increasing water age the calculated aggregate cytotoxicity decreased significantly as dcan degraded under alkaline ph conditions calculated aggregate cytotoxicity leveled off due to the formation of n cl dcam whereas it continued to decrease when dcaa was the predominant dcan degradation end product at neutral or acidic phs this toxicity trajectory is contrary to the prevailing notion that supports current dbp regulations which use stable end products such as dcaa as an indicator of exposure to the complex mixture of dbps in chlorinated drinking waters stage ii disinfectant and disinfection byproducts rule national primary drinking water regulations 2006 since the formation of regulated end products i e haas and thms increases monotonically with increasing chlorine contact time reckhow and singer 1985 it is assumed that the overall dbp associated toxicity of drinking water is positively correlated with water age however our kinetic data suggest a reduction in calculated cytotoxicity of chlorinated water when it is aged although the absolute values of the calculated aggregate cytotoxicity are not directly translatable to potential dbp associated health risks of real drinking water the different toxicity trajectories of metastable and regulated dbps raise questions about the correct regulatory drivers given that the dbps that are subject to regulations i e thms and haas differ from those that drive the calculated toxicity e g hans in both formation and degradation kinetics it is likely that those currently implemented dbp control strategies especially shortening of water age would push the overall toxicity of drinking water to an elevated level because those less highly chlorinated treated waters often contain higher levels of more toxic metastable dbps e g hans 4 conclusions dcan formation kinetics was investigated under a range of ph conditions i e ph 6 9 during the chlorination of free aspartic acid and two aspartyl containing tetrapeptides i e asp asp asp asp and arg gly asp ser results indicate that free aspartic acid reacts very rapidly with aqueous chlorine large quantities of dcan up to 100 conversion rate from free aspartic acid to dcan at ph 8 and 9 initially formed but subsequently degraded over the course of free aspartic acid chlorination leaving the corresponding n cl dcam and dcaa as major degradation end products on the other hand chlorination of combined aspartyl residues also led to significant dcan formation whereas the rate of dcan formation was much slower compared to that from free aspartic acid chlorination moreover dcan formation from the two model peptides was catalyzed by high ph accordingly a chlorine induced base catalyzed stepwise peptide degradation pathway was proposed as one possible mechanism for dcan formation from combined amino acid chlorination perhaps most importantly it is demonstrated in this study that over increasing chlorine exposure there exists a transition from natural organic precursors through metastable chlorination intermediates e g dcan or n cl dcam to stable end products e g dcaa by weighting dbp concentrations by their respective cytotoxic potencies it is estimated that the calculated aggregate cytotoxicity of chlorinated water would reach its maximum at relatively short water ages therefore there is a risk that by placing regulatory focus solely on end products i e haas excluding reactive chlorination intermediates such as hans the overall toxicity of drinking water might be inadvertently elevated declaration

18403,the formation and occurrence of haloacetonitriles hans in drinking water is of increasing concern because recent data have shown that they are the major contributors to dbp associated toxicity of disinfected waters earlier research on han formation had established free amino acids as important han precursors due to their high reactivity with chlorine however free amino acids are unlikely to be the primary precursors for hans in natural waters mainly because the actual concentrations of these compounds are too low to sufficiently account for observed han formation on the other hand combined amino acids i e peptides and proteins are of much higher abundance even though it is unclear if they can contribute to han formation given that nearly all the amino nitrogen is tied up in peptide linkages in order to clarify the reactivity of combined amino acids with chlorine to form hans dichloroacetonitrile dcan formation kinetics was compared between free aspartic acid and two aspartyl containing tetrapeptides i e asp asp asp asp and arg gly asp ser results indicated that aspartyl residue could also lead to dcan formation upon chlorination whereas the rate of dcan formation was much slower compared to that from free aspartic acid chlorination moreover dcan formation from the two model peptides was catalyzed by high ph this is because chlorine induced peptide backbone degradation is the key to dcan formation from the chlorination of combined amino acids and this slow stepwise process is base catalyzed perhaps most importantly regardless of the precursors dcan was continuously formed but simultaneously degraded especially at alkaline phs leaving the corresponding n chloro 2 2 dichloroacetamide n cl dcam and dichloroacetic acid dcaa as major end products it was observed that over increasing chlorine exposure there exists an important transition from initial organic precursors through metastable chlorination intermediates e g dcan and n cl dcam and finally to stable end products e g dcaa by weighting dbp concentrations by their respective cytotoxic potencies it is estimated that the aggregate cytotoxicity of chlorinated water would reach its maximum at relatively short chlorine contact times in general shorter water age and lower ph both resulted in higher levels of metastable intermediates i e dcan and thus higher levels of aggregate calculated cytotoxicity the resulting toxicity profile is different from the prevailing notion that supports current dbp regulations therefore there is a risk that by placing regulatory limits and control strategies exclusively on regulated end products e g haas the overall toxicity of drinking water might be inadvertently elevated graphical abstract image 1 keywords haloacetonitriles metastable

tryptophan tyrosine histidine and kynurenine under conditions of excess chlorine trehy and bieber 1981 ueno et al 1996 earlier literature indicated that nitrile formation is characteristic of amino acid chlorination when the first stage in the reaction is featured by the formation of a dichloroamino acid dakin 1916 in the case of aspartic acid for example the amino acid can be oxidized to dichloroacetonitrile dcan via the nitrile pathway fig s1 trehy and bieber 1981 trehy et al 1986 peters et al 1990 hureiki et al 1994 deborde and von gunten 2008 chu et al 2010 shah and mitch 2011 bond et al 2012 chlorination of the α amino nitrogen first leads to the formation of n n dichloroaspartic acid subsequent decarboxylation of this dichloramine forms an n chloroaldimine which further dehydrohalogenates i e elimination of hydrochloric acid to yield the cyanoacetic acid due to combined electron withdrawing effect from both the carboxylic acid group and the nitrile group the methylene carbon in cyanoacetic acid is very acidic such that dichlorination coupled with decarboxylation of this reaction intermediate ultimately results in dcan formation despite the general acknowledgement that free amino acids such as aspartic acid reacts quickly with excess chlorine leading to very rapid nitrile formation alouini and seux 1987 they are unlikely to be the primary han precursors in surface waters this is because free amino acids only account for a very small fraction 4 10 of total dissolved amino acids peake et al 1972 lytle and perdue 1981 dotson and westerhoff 2009 and thus their concentrations are insufficient to account for the observed han occurrence in drinking waters moreover the specific formation of hans instead of other nitriles depends on the amino acid precursor structure and requires the presence of activating groups e g aromatic rings on the other hand approximately 60 of dissolved amino acids in natural waters are bound within biological macromolecules e g proteins or peptides and another 20 are associated with humic substances tuschall and brezonik 1980 thurman 1985 therefore those combined amino acids are up to four to five times as abundant as the free forms hureiki et al 1994 thurman 1985 and they may be the most likely precursor pool for hans in surface waters although combined amino acids are of relatively high abundance uncertainty remains regarding their reactivity with halogenating agents e g chlorine or chloramines and thus their potential contribution to han formation as is apparent in fig s1 the presence of a primary amine group in aspartic acid is pivotal to the final formation of dcan since the initial step of amino acid chlorination is the attack of chlorine on amine nitrogen to form an organic n chloramine in contrast to the case of free amino acids the majority of amino nitrogen in combined amino acids is tied up in amide peptide linkages and therefore is orders of magnitude less reactive than amine nitrogen hawkins and davies 1999 in fact many have proposed that amide nitrogen in peptide bonds is unreactive with aqueous chlorine pereira et al 1973 hureiki et al 1994 due to the absence of a primary amine group it is likely that a bonded aspartyl residue will not be as reactive as free aspartic acid with chlorine to form the corresponding dcan on the contrary there is evidence that peptide bonds can undergo slow degradation in a stepwise fashion in the presence of chlorine goldschmidt et al 1927 keefe et al 1997 fox et al 1997 and han formation can be interpreted as a result of such chlorine induced peptide degradation bieber and trehy 1983 for these reasons it is unclear if there is substantial reaction between chlorine and amino nitrogen in combined amino acids and if yields of hans from specific amino acid monomers e g aspartic acid histidine tryptophan and tyrosine as prolific han producers are significant enough so that the role of combined amino acids as primary han precursors can be justified moreover it is well recognized that hans are unlike trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acid haas which are among the most chemically stable end products of the reaction between chlorine and natural organic matter nom instead hans are metastable intermediates that fall along the trajectory between nom and haas and thus their instantaneous yields are dually dependent on the reaction kinetics of both their continuous formation and their simultaneous degradation reckhow et al 2001 however the amount of han lost due to its in situ degradation has been greatly overlooked in previous han formation studies perhaps most importantly as hans degrade they leave other dpbs in their place peters et al 1990 glezer et al 1999 reckhow et al 2001 yu and reckhow 2015 2017 in the case of dcan it can undergo base catalyzed hydrolysis forming the corresponding 2 2 dichloroacetamide dcam as an intermediate and further dcam hydrolysis will leads to dichloroacetic acid dcaa formation as a stable end product glezer et al 1999 reckhow et al 2001 yu and reckhow 2015 in actual drinking water containing a free chlorine residual dcan can be chlorinated rather rapidly to form another nitrogenous dbp the n chloro 2 2 dichloroacetamide n cl dcam under relatively alkaline ph conditions i e 7 ph 9 yu and reckhow 2017 alternatively n cl dcam can be formed via a hypochlorite catalyzed dcan hydrolysis pathway fig 3 yu and reckhow 2017 once formed n cl dcam tends to deprotonate fig 3 due to its low pka value i e p k a n c l d c a m 3 71 menard and lessard 1978 and the anionic form of n cl dcam has been demonstrated to be very stable and thus persistent in chlorinated drinking waters yu and reckhow 2017 as an organic chloramine n cl dcam has been shown to be more toxicologically potent than previously misidentified dcam vu et al 2018 bull et al 2011 and therefore may pose higher carcinogenic risks to drinking water consumers this transition from initial hans through degradation intermediates i e haloacetamides and n chloro haloacetamides and finally to regulated end products i e haas is fundamentally different from our understanding of dbp behavior pertaining to regulated compounds since the discovery of thms and haas as byproducts of drinking water disinfection considerable efforts have been focused on characterizing the formation of those two classes of dbps from the chlorination of model organic compounds aquatic humic and fulvic acids and raw drinking waters showing an almost exclusive monotonic increase in their formation with increasing chlorine contact time and chlorine dose reckhow and singer 1985 because thms and haas are subject of current regulation control strategies have mainly focused on minimizing their formation and therefore are reliant on their formation chemistry for example regulatory drivers encourage utilities to distribute water that is of shorter water age concurrently an increasing number of utilities are switching away from the sole reliance on chlorine disinfection to combinations of primary disinfectants with chloramines as secondary disinfectants seidel et al 2005 li and mitch 2018 taken together the end result is often higher levels of metastable intermediates such as hans in those less highly chlorinated waters blank et al 2002 perhaps most importantly when dbp concentrations were weighted by measures of their toxic potencies e g chinese hamster ovary cell cytotoxicity and genotoxicity hans have been shown to be the primary toxicity drivers in different types of disinfected water muellner et al 2007 wagner and plewa 2017 zeng et al 2016 chuang and mitch 2017 krasner et al 2016 plewa et al 2017 therefore there is a risk that the application of those aforementioned control strategies is inadvertently pushing the overall toxicity of drinking water to an elevated level by focusing solely on end products i e thms and haas and excluding reactive chlorination intermediates such as hans the purpose of this study was to compare the reactivity of free amino acids with that of combined amino acids in terms of han formation under a range of ph conditions so as to clarify the reactivity of polypeptides with aqueous chlorine since monochloramine is a weaker and slower acting disinfectant than free chlorine chlorine transfer from monochloramine to nitrogenous organic precursors will be at a much slower rate hureiki et al 1994 isaac and morris 1985 therefore chloramination of polypeptides is unlikely the predominant pathway to han formation when monochloramine is employed as a secondary disinfectant furthermore monochloramine can be an additional nitrogen source and produces hans even when the organic precursors are non nitrogenous nihemaiti et al 2016 thus complicating the elucidation of the role of bonded amino nitrogen in han formation due to these two reasons only the reactions between free chlorine and amino acids were investigated in this study two tetrapeptides i e asp asp asp asp and arg gly asp ser were selected as model precursors and the chlorination reaction of combined aspartyl residue was compared to that of free aspartic acid in terms of dcan formation kinetics a second objective of this study was to quantify the compensatory formation of n cl dcam and dcaa as dcan degradation products and to assess if the discrepancy between anticipated dcan formation and its observed concentrations can be accounted for by the formation of those two secondary dbps another key objective was to project temporal toxicity profiles by weighting measured dbp concentrations by their corresponding toxic potencies to evaluate the contribution of metastable dbps e g hans to the dbp associated toxicity of drinking water as a function of water age 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection of model peptides of all the free amino acids aspartic acid has been demonstrated to be the most prolific dcan producer when treated with excess chlorine trehy and bieber 1981 bieber and trehy 1983 bond et al 2014 given the comparison to be made in this study the presence of at least one aspartyl residue was used as an essential criterion for the selection of a model peptide for this reason two tetrapeptides that contain different numbers of aspartyl residues were chosen tetraaspartic acid i e asp asp asp asp is the simplest aspartyl containing peptide that is commercially available the other aspartyl containing peptide selected was arg gly asp ser for the following two reasons first unlike asp asp asp asp which contains four aspartyl residues with one starting at the n terminal arg gly asp ser is composed of only one available aspartyl residue in the middle of the peptide backbone and thus may not lead to dcan formation if this bonded aspartyl residue is not reactive with chlorine second other nitriles may also be produced from the chlorination of arginine glycine and serine monomers but dcan formation will be specific only to the aspartyl residue 2 2 chemicals and reagents l aspartic acid reagent grade 98 asp asp asp asp 97 arg gly asp ser 95 and all dbp standard compounds including dichloroacetonitrile dcan dichloroacetamide dcam and dichloroacetic acid dcaa were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo general laboratory chemicals and organic solvents were supplied by fisher scientific pittsburgh pa and were of acs grade unless otherwise noted purified n chloro 2 2 dichloroacetamide n cl dcam standard compound is not commercially available therefore this compound was prepared by reacting an equal stoichiometric amount of free chlorine with the corresponding dcam cl2 n 1 1 with ph of both solutions adjusted to 9 0 before mixing the formation of n cl dcam in the

a preceding paper by the authors yu and reckhow 2017 2 3 experimental conditions all reaction solutions were prepared in ultrapure milli q water emd millipore corp containing 10mm phosphate buffer and were adjusted to the desired phs using either sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid at the start of each chlorination experiment a pre determined amount of an individual model compound was introduced

concentration was standardized according to the n n diethyl p phenylene diamine dpd ferrous ammonium sulfate fas titrimetric method epa method 330 4 chlorination of individual model precursors was conducted by adding a small volume of acidified sodium hypochlorite solution to each buffered precursor containing solution so that the initial chlorine concentration was 15 mg l as cl2 211 μm as cl2 based on preliminary calculations of chlorine demand hureiki et al 1994 the precursor concentrations and initial chlorine dose were determined as such that regardless if aspartic acid is in the free or combined form this amino acid would be exposed to relatively the same amount of chlorine residual over reaction time i e same chlorine exposure or ct immediately after the introduction of chlorine samples were partitioned off into 300 ml bod bottles with no headspace and were stored in a dark 20 c incubator for the prescribed reaction times at each reaction time one bottle of sample was sacrificed and analyzed instantaneously for residual chlorine and dbp concentrations in this study all measurements were made in duplicates to account for analytical uncertainties 2 4 sample preparation and dbp analysis after the prescribed chlorine contact time residual chlorine in each sample was quenched by 25 mg l ammonium chloride the use ammonium chloride as the quenching agent was to prevent formed n cl dcam from being reduced to the corresponding dcam yu and reckhow 2017 more importantly all sample extractions were performed immediately after quenching to minimize the potential inference from the formation of monochloramine dcan was quantified using a slightly modified version of the epa method 551 1 to prevent formed dcan from base catalyzed hydrolysis yu and reckhow 2015 during sample preparation 20 ml aliquots of quenched sample were acidified to ph 6 using hydrochloric acid followed by liquid liquid extraction using 4 ml of pentane with an internal standard i e 1 2 dibromopropane and 15 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate the mixture was then subjected to mechanical shaking at 300 rpm for 15 min and 1 ml of the upper organic layer was collected for subsequent analysis by gas chromatography electron capture detector agilent 6890 gc μecd dcaa analysis was conducted following a protocol that is closely aligned with the epa method 552 2 in brief 30

retention time of n cl dcam is 1 289 min and its method detection limit is 0 90 μg l 2 5 calculation of dbp associated cytotoxicity the cytotoxicity of measured dbps i e dcan n cl dcam and dcaa was calculated by dividing measured concentrations by published cytotoxic potencies potencies for individual dbps were determined based on the in vitro chinese hamster ovary cho cell assay which are

dcaa are 5 73 10 5 m 3 90 10 4 m and 7 30 10 3 m wagner and plewa 2017 vu et al 2018 respectively indicating a decrease in toxic potencies along the dcan degradation pathway the aggregate toxicity profiles were projected as a function of reaction time by summing the calculated cytotoxicity for each dbp assuming they are linearly additive 3 results and discussions 3 1 kinetic dcan formation during the chlorination of free aspartic acid to evaluate the reactivity of free aspartic acid in terms of dcan formation a chlorination study of buffered aspartic acid solutions was conducted under four ph conditions i e ph 6 7 8 and 9 with excess chlorine cl2 asp 10 1 μm μm in each case the amount of dcan formed was quantified over reaction time from a few hours to a total of two weeks fig 1 shows the individual dcan formation profiles at each of the four phs in general observed dcan concentrations did not follow a monotonic increasing trend with increasing reaction time instead dcan concentration reached a maximum between 12 and 48 h and significantly decreased at longer reaction times under all ph conditions in addition dcan concentrations were consistently lower when chlorination was conducted at higher phs this actual decrease in dcan concentration over time is clear evidence of simultaneous dcan degradation to its continuous formation therefore it is necessary to determine the amount of dcan that was initially formed but subsequently degraded because cumulative dcan formation if there was no dcan decomposition may be substantially greater than its instantaneously measured amount in a previous study by the authors yu and reckhow 2015 dcan degradation kinetics was fully characterized its degradation rate can be described by equation 1 which reflects simultaneous dcan reactions with neutral water hydroxide i e oh and hypochlorite i e ocl as major reactive constituents in chlorinated waters 1 d d c a n d t k h 2 o d c a n k o h o h d c a n k o c l o c l d c a n in equation 1 k h 2 o and k o h are the neutral and base catalyzed hydrolysis rate constants and k o c l is the hypochlorite chlorination rate constant the three rate constants are estimated to be 1 68 1 02 10 4 hr 1 5 60 0 31 103m 1hr 1 and 6 85 0 45 102m 1hr 1 respectively yu and reckhow 2015 since free chlorine residual rather than hypochlorite concentrations are often that can be measured equation 1 was reformulated into equation 2 using the hypochlorous acid dissociation constant i e k a hocl 10 7 582 at 20 c morris 1966 so that hypochlorite concentration can be expressed in the form of a fraction of total free chlorine concentration i e c t at any given ph 2 d d c a n d t k h 2 o k o h o h k o c l α 1 c t d c a n 3 α 1 k a h o c l k a h o c l h when both dcan and residual free chlorine concentrations are monitored as a function of reaction time fig 1 and fig s2 the amount of dcan that decomposed in a discretized time step from t to t 1 can be

δ d c a n k h 2 o k o h o h k o c l α 1 c t t c t t 1 2 d c a n t d c a n t 1 2 δ t the cumulative dcan formation denoted as d c a n f can be calculated according to equation 5 through a stepwise

i n i t i a l c o n d i t i o n d c a n f t t 0 0 it is noteworthy that both dcan and residual free chlorine concentrations need to be quantified at relative high frequencies to minimize the time intervals between t and t 1 ensuring the robustness of the estimated intermediate dcan and residual free chlorine concentrations via linear interpolation results of this calculation are presented by the dashed lines in fig 1 it is clear from fig 1 that near quantitative amounts of dcan were initially formed but subsequently degraded during the chlorination of free aspartic acid after 96 h i e 4 days a maximum of about 90 of total aspartic acid was converted into dcan at ph 6 and this cumulative dcan formation leveled off over longer periods of time this compares with about 97 100 and 100 maximum cumulative dcan formation at ph 7 8 and 9 respectively in contrast to prior reports that nitrile formation from amino acid chlorination is favored by low ph trehy 1980 alouini and seux 1987 the calculated cumulative dcan formation i e dashed lines in fig 1 suggests that aspartic acid has an equal or greater tendency to form dcan under more alkaline ph conditions i e ph 7 in the presence of excess chlorine based on these data we propose that the reaction between aspartic acid and chlorine proceeds to completion almost entirely via the nitrile pathway fig s1 at both ph 8 and ph 9 as cumulative dcan formation reached 100 however accelerated dcan degradation at higher phs reckhow et al 2001 yu and reckhow 2015 resulted in more extensive dcan decomposition and thus less amount of dcan measured taken together the amount of dcan formed during aspartic acid chlorination at higher phs may be greater even though the measured concentrations were significantly lower due to its higher rate of degradation this discrepancy between cumulative dcan formation and observed or measured dcan concentration may explain why previously reported dcan yields from the chlorination of free aspartic acid are highly variable ranging from 0 01 to 11 1 at ph 7 with reaction times differing from hours to days trehy et al 1986 ueno et al 1996 yang et al 2012 bond et al 2014 disparate chlorination protocols applied across different studies that varied in chlorine exposure might have resulted in different extents of dcan degradation lastly fig 1 shows that the rate of cumulative dcan formation is nearly independent of ph as dcan formation profiles followed the same trajectory at all four phs i e ph 6 9 this is indicative of very rapid initial reactions between free aspartic acid and chlorine to form the n chloroaspartic acid and then n n dichloroaspartic acid likely on a timescale of seconds to minutes alouini and seux 1987 as a result the rate limiting step for dcan formation through the nitrile pathway is no longer ph dependent or chlorine concentration dependent instead dehydrohalogenation of the n chloroaldimine fig s1 is a good candidate for the rate limiting step in dcan formation as n chloroaldimines are reported to be relatively stable in the presence of a free chlorine residual nweke and scully 1989 3 2 n cl dcam and dcaa formation as a result of dcan degradation as demonstrated above large quantities of dcan initially formed but subsequently degraded over the course of free aspartic acid chlorination therefore it is necessary to consider what secondary degradation products were formed and which of these products would predominate under relevant ph conditions in a prior study n cl dcam and dcaa were found to be the major dcan degradation products in chlorinated drinking waters yu and reckhow 2017 for this reason these two compounds were quantified at each reaction time and a mass balance was determined regarding the amount of dcan decomposed and the amount of n cl dcam and dcaa formed it needs to be noted that the formation of dcam was not observed in this experiment since dcam does not persist in the presence of free chlorine due to its rapid reaction with hypochlorite to form the n cl dcam via a n chlorination pathway yu and reckhow 2017 fig 2 shows the measured concentrations of dcan n cl dcam and dcaa along with the calculated cumulative dcan formation under all four ph conditions in general appreciable amounts of n cl dcam and dcaa were formed which almost fully accounted for the amount of dcan degraded especially at higher phs i e ph 8 and ph 9 this is supported by the calculated aggregate molar concentrations of dcan n cl dcam and dcaa as presented in fig 2 i e purple diamonds which followed the same trends as the amount of dcan predicted to have formed i e d c a n f however there exists a small but noticeable discrepancy between those two calculated values at ph 6 and ph 7 over long periods of reaction time which might be attributed to the formation of some other reaction intermediates that were not identified or quantified in this study the concentration of n cl dcam increased not only with increasing reaction time but also with increasing ph at lower phs i e ph 6 and ph 7 n cl dcam was barely measurable when ph was increased to 8 its formation became much more substantial and reached a maximum molar yield of 45 at 48 h followed by a slight decrease at longer reaction times more n cl dcam was formed at ph 9 and its molar yield reached a maximum of 62 at 48 h and leveled off thereafter these trends are in agreement with our latest understanding of the ph impacts on n cl dcam formation and stability in brief high ph favors n cl dcam formation and inhibits its decomposition yu and reckhow 2017 on the other hand dcaa concentration exhibited an overall monotonic increase with time but a significant decrease with ph when it was above 7 this is because dcan degrades to form dcaa mainly through an acid catalyzed n cl dcam chlorination pathway fig 3 yu and reckhow 2017 under neutral or slightly acidic ph conditions n cl dcam degradation was accelerated so that dcaa became the predominant dcan degradation product and accounted for the majority amount of dcan decomposed at ph 6 least amount of dcan was degraded over time compared to the other three higher phs as a result least amount of dcaa was formed it should be noted that a considerable amount of dcaa was still formed at ph 8 and 9 even when the intermediate n cl dcam did not significantly degrade fig 2 this is indicative of the existence of another dcaa formation pathway that is independent of acid catalyzed n cl dcam chlorination since the sum of the amount of n cl dcam and dcaa formed equals the amount of dcan degraded this dcaa formation at ph 8 and 9 is therefore still a result of dcan degradation based on these facts a new dcaa formation pathway was proposed as shown in fig 3 in this pathway dcan undergoes sequential reactions with hydroxide and hypochlorite to form the n chloro 2 2 dichloroethane 1 1 diol which is a hydroxyl adduct of n cl dcam further hydrolysis of this adduct eventually forms dcaa due to the specific participation of both hydroxide and hypochlorite this reaction is presumed to be base catalyzed and thus was observed only under alkaline ph conditions i e ph 8 and 9 in this experiment 3 3 dcan formation during the chlorination of combined aspartic acid chemistry of peptide chlorination as discussed earlier free aspartic acid is very reactive with aqueous chlorine forming large quantities of dcan that are subsequently degraded in contrast given the same reaction time and ph the bonded aspartic acid monomer in either asp asp asp asp or arg gly asp ser produced approximately one order of magnitude less dcan compared to free aspartic acid fig s3 for instance measured dcan concentrations per aspartyl residue were 4 and 0 9 at ph 8 after 24 h of chlorination of asp asp asp asp and arg gly asp ser respectively this compares to a measured dcan molar yield of 27 from the chlorination of free aspartic acid under the same conditions following the same trend as free aspartic acid combined aspartic acid led to greater initial dcan formation i e d c a n f at higher phs even though the amount of dcan degraded was also more substantial this is indicated by a significant increase in the discrepancy i e δ d c a n shown in fig 4 between measured and calculated dcan formation with increasing ph in addition the rate of dcan formation was also faster at higher phs during the chlorination of both tetrapeptides fig s3 this is different from dcan formation from free aspartic acid chlorination where its formation rate was nearly independent of reaction ph fig 1 taken all together it is clear that combined aspartic acid resulted in much slower dcan formation than did free aspartic acid under the same chlorine exposure fig s2 and ph conditions and its reactions with chlorine are subject to base catalysis this supports our hypothesized mechanistic rationale that chlorine induced peptide degradation might be the key to nitrile formation from combined amino acids since peptide bond degradation is also known to be a slow and base catalyzed process bieber and trehy 1983 fig 5 shows the proposed mechanisms for the formation of dcan during the chlorination of a generic peptide although bonded amide nitrogen in peptide linkages may not be directly reactive with aqueous chlorine pereira et al 1973 hureiki et al 1994 the unprotected free amine group of the n terminal amino acid can still be chlorinated in the same way as the α amine group of its free form leading to the formation of an n n dichloramine under conditions of excess chlorine if a peptide possesses an aspartyl residue at the n terminal end chlorination of this peptide will first lead to the formation of a combined n n dichloroaspartic acid fig 5 instead of undergoing a decarboxylation reaction like the free n n dichloroaspartic acid fig s1 this combined dichloramine is subject to dehydrohalogenation to yield a combined n chloroaldimine subsequent dehydrohalogenation of the n chloroaldimine coupled with c c bond cleavage frees a cyanoacetic acid from the peptide backbone and yields an isocyanate the resulting cyanoacetic acid reacts quickly with chlorine leading to final dcan formation via dichlorination and decarboxylation fig 5 perhaps most importantly hydrolysis of the isocyanate will generate a new free amine group as the n terminus for the remaining peptide keefe et al 1997 fox et al 1997 so that the same set of chlorination reactions can proceed onto the next amino acid monomer as a result the peptide will be degraded by excess chlorine in a slow stepwise fashion goldschmidt et al 1927 bieber and trehy 1983 keefe et al 1997 fox et al 1997 and dcan can be produced at any point when the remaining peptide contains an n terminal aspartyl residue in conclusion the availability of a free amine group at the n terminal end is essential to the chlorine induced base catalyzed peptide degradation sequence fig 5 and dcan formation is a result of such stepwise reactions when certain reactive n terminal amino acid monomers e g aspartyl residue are cleaved off the peptide backbone however we recognize that there are likely many other parallel reaction pathways and the development of a full scheme of peptide chlorination reaction pathways is outside of the scope of this work since peptide backbone is degraded by chlorine in a stepwise manner every aspartic acid monomer will form dcan at a different rate depending on its order in the peptide sequence the closer an aspartyl residue is located to the c terminal end the slower is the formation of dcan from this residue this is because its bonded amide nitrogen will not be accessible to aqueous chlorine until all prior amino acid residues are sequentially degraded to render this nitrogen free in contrast due to the possession of an unprotected free amine nitrogen the n terminal aspartyl residue can be chlorinated most readily to form dcan for this reason the rate of dcan formation from the four aspartyl residues in asp asp asp asp should follow a decreasing order from the first to the fourth and the apparent dcan formation rate shown by dashed lines in fig 4 should be interpreted as an averaged rate from the four monomers compared to asp asp asp asp arg gly asp ser contains only one aspartyl residue next to the c terminus so that dcan formation from this tetrapeptide is expected to be much slower this is because dcan formation from this peptide is controlled by the rate at which arginine and glycine residues are removed from the peptide backbone as is clear in figs 4 and s3 the calculated cumulative dcan formation profiles i e d c a n f are in good alignment with those anticipated trends with the rate of dcan formation per aspartyl residue from asp asp asp asp being faster than its formation from arg gly asp ser the proposed mechanisms for the formation of dcan from the chlorination of those two tetrapeptides are shown in figs s4 and s5 3 4 kinetics of n cl dcam and dcaa formation during the chlorination of asp asp asp asp and arg gly asp ser in this experiment the formation of n cl dcam and dcaa was also monitored over the course of asp asp asp asp and arg gly asp ser chlorination to examine their relations to dcan it is evident in fig 6 that n cl dcam formation followed many of the same trends as noted during free aspartic acid chlorination when ph was below or equal to neutral the amount of n cl dcam formed was almost trivial this is attributable to an overall low dcan yield from both tetrapeptides under relatively acidic ph conditions i e maximum cumulative dcan formation 10 when chlorine induced peptide degradation is suppressed in addition dcan is less susceptible to degradation by hypochlorite to form n cl dcam at low phs yu and reckhow 2015 2017 at ph 8 n cl dcam concentration profiles were characterized by an initial accumulation reaching a maximum followed by a slight decrease over longer reaction times similar to the case of free aspartic acid n cl dcam formation from both asp asp asp asp and arg gly asp ser was pronounced at ph 9 and exhibited a monotonic increase with increasing reaction time compared to n cl dcam chlorination of both tetrapeptides formed much greater amounts of dcaa under most ph conditions more importantly dcaa concentrations were consistently higher than the amounts of dcan predicted to have formed during the chlorination of arg gly asp ser moreover dcaa formation was much faster than that of dcan regardless of reaction ph this substantial deviation from the expected dcaa formation profile is suggestive of the existence of some other dcaa formation pathways in addition to the three summarized in fig 3 which are dependent solely on dcan decomposition as proposed in the literature reckhow et al 2001 bieber and trehy 1983 the attack of chlorine on proteinaceous precursors can be interpreted as a two step process electron rich side groups first undergo relatively rapid reactions with chlorine to give rise to fast chlorine demand and formation of chlorinated dbps e g thms and haas hureiki et al 1994 under conditions of excess chlorine the peptide backbone then degrades slowly in a stepwise fashion goldschmidt et al 1927 bieber and trehy 1983 resulting in dihaloacetonitrile dhan formation therefore it is chemically plausible that dcaa was derived mainly from amino acid side chains during the chlorination of arg gly asp ser although a more fundamental understanding of the side group chlorination mechanisms requires more detailed work in the future 3 5 implications with respect to dbp associated toxicity of drinking water and dbp regulations fig 7 presents the calculated cytotoxicity as a function of reaction time and ph for each of the three model precursors by weighting measured dbp concentrations data shown in figs 2 and 6 by their cytotoxic potencies reported in the literature wagner and plewa 2017 vu et al 2018 since dcan lc50 dcan 5 73 10 5 m is one and two orders of magnitude more potent than n cl dcam and dcaa respectively lc50 n cl dcam 3 90 10 4 m lc50 dcaa 7 30 10 3 m the calculated aggregate cytotoxicity i e sum of the calculated cytotoxicity for each dbp was driven predominantly by dcan for this reason at higher phs and longer reaction times when dcan concentration profiles were mainly characterized by its degradation there was a substantial decrease in calculated aggregate cytotoxicity it is important to note that at ph 9 as dcan quickly degraded to below detection limit in 24 h the decrease in calculated aggregate cytotoxicity was offset by the formation of n cl dcam which became the dominant calculated cytotoxicity contributor over long periods of time a similar offsetting phenomenon was also observed at ph 8 whereas n cl dcam contributed to a lesser extent to the calculated aggregate cytotoxicity compared to ph 9 as is expected the contribution of dcaa to the calculated aggregate cytotoxicity was generally negligible even though it accounted for a relatively large portion of formed dbps on a mass basis especially in the case of asp asp asp asp and arg gly asp ser chlorination fig 6 most importantly the calculated aggregate cytotoxicity exhibited similar trends over increasing reaction time during the chlorination of the three organic model precursors regardless of whether aspartic acid was free or combined calculated aggregate cytotoxicity of these chlorinated waters all started from zero with non toxic organic precursors i e free amino acids or peptides and increased rapidly as dcan formed with increasing water age the calculated aggregate cytotoxicity decreased significantly as dcan degraded under alkaline ph conditions calculated aggregate cytotoxicity leveled off due to the formation of n cl dcam whereas it continued to decrease when dcaa was the predominant dcan degradation end product at neutral or acidic phs this toxicity trajectory is contrary to the prevailing notion that supports current dbp regulations which use stable end products such as dcaa as an indicator of exposure to the complex mixture of dbps in chlorinated drinking waters stage ii disinfectant and disinfection byproducts rule national primary drinking water regulations 2006 since the formation of regulated end products i e haas and thms increases monotonically with increasing chlorine contact time reckhow and singer 1985 it is assumed that the overall dbp associated toxicity of drinking water is positively correlated with water age however our kinetic data suggest a reduction in calculated cytotoxicity of chlorinated water when it is aged although the absolute values of the calculated aggregate cytotoxicity are not directly translatable to potential dbp associated health risks of real drinking water the different toxicity trajectories of metastable and regulated dbps raise questions about the correct regulatory drivers given that the dbps that are subject to regulations i e thms and haas differ from those that drive the calculated toxicity e g hans in both formation and degradation kinetics it is likely that those currently implemented dbp control strategies especially shortening of water age would push the overall toxicity of drinking water to an elevated level because those less highly chlorinated treated waters often contain higher levels of more toxic metastable dbps e g hans 4 conclusions dcan formation kinetics was investigated under a range of ph conditions i e ph 6 9 during the chlorination of free aspartic acid and two aspartyl containing tetrapeptides i e asp asp asp asp and arg gly asp ser results indicate that free aspartic acid reacts very rapidly with aqueous chlorine large quantities of dcan up to 100 conversion rate from free aspartic acid to dcan at ph 8 and 9 initially formed but subsequently degraded over the course of free aspartic acid chlorination leaving the corresponding n cl dcam and dcaa as major degradation end products on the other hand chlorination of combined aspartyl residues also led to significant dcan formation whereas the rate of dcan formation was much slower compared to that from free aspartic acid chlorination moreover dcan formation from the two model peptides was catalyzed by high ph accordingly a chlorine induced base catalyzed stepwise peptide degradation pathway was proposed as one possible mechanism for dcan formation from combined amino acid chlorination perhaps most importantly it is demonstrated in this study that over increasing chlorine exposure there exists a transition from natural organic precursors through metastable chlorination intermediates e g dcan or n cl dcam to stable end products e g dcaa by weighting dbp concentrations by their respective cytotoxic potencies it is estimated that the calculated aggregate cytotoxicity of chlorinated water would reach its maximum at relatively short water ages therefore there is a risk that by placing regulatory focus solely on end products i e haas excluding reactive chlorination intermediates such as hans the overall toxicity of drinking water might be inadvertently elevated declaration

18404,the high content of organics in municipal reverse osmosis concentrate roc requires proper treatment here this study applied the photoelectrocatalysis pec to reduce the concentration of organics in roc meanwhile the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps was investigated participation of primary oxidants in organics removal and dbps formation was revealed at different anodic potentials and phs the results showed that pec process effectively oxidized the organics in roc achieving the highest mineralization rate of 63 increasing anodic potential from 0 to 1 0 v enhanced the oxidations of bulk organics i e dissolved organic carbons doc uv254 fluorescence large molecular weight compounds and trace level pharmaceuticals raising anodic potential to higher than 1 0 v slightly benefited the oxidations of bulk organics owing to the relatively stable formation of hydroxyl radicals oh and radical reactive chlorine species r rcs the continuously rising concentration of free chlorine fc accelerated the decompositions of pharmaceuticals at 1 0 v however the generated fc raised the concentration of dbps up to 10 36 μmol l at 3 0 v lowering initial ph from 7 9 to 4 6 improved the mineralization rates by around 20 due to the higher formation of oh at ph 4 6 further decreasing initial ph from 6 to 4 enhanced the breakdown of large molecular weight compounds as well as the decomposition of pharmaceuticals this came from the strengthened formation of fc and r rcs at lower phs the intense participation of fc and r rcs resulted in a higher total dbp concentration at ph 4 6 than that at ph 7 9 however the individual species of dbps changed differently toward the ph shift the results of this study show that pec could be an alternative for organics oxidation in roc with

wastewater reuses pérez gonzález et al 2012 during the ro process the contaminants are concentrated in ro concentrate roc taking up around 20 30 of the feed water umar et al 2015 given high salinity and abundant recalcitrant organics in roc direct discharge or improper management can result in adverse environmental effects pérez gonzález et al 2012 pooi et al 2019 sun et al 2014 besides the bulk organics in roc particular attention should be paid to the micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals pharmaceuticals in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants are concentrated several times to hundreds or thousands of ng l in roc jamil et al 2019 wei et al 2015 the removals of trace levels of pharmaceuticals suffer from the great quenching effect of the water matrix li and hu 2018 2016 yang et al 2016 therefore the removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals in roc other than bulk organics should be additionally verified advanced oxidation processes aops have been proven efficient in degrading both bulk organics and micropollutants in roc umar et al 2015 among aops photoelectrocatalysis pec is a potential alternative for roc treatment the high salinity of roc ensures sufficient conductivity for pec to proceed pec is effective in removing humic acids selcuk and bekbolet 2008 pharmaceuticals liu et al 2019 su et al 2016 xiao et al 2015 ammonia ji et al 2017 xiao et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 and microorganisms pires et al 2016 selcuk 2010 sun et al 2016 however in previous studies pec was mostly applied in synthetic wastewater with relatively simple water matrix the application of pec in real wastewater is still limited and has yet been attempted for the roc treatment garcia segura and brillas 2017 recently the roles of halide ions such as cl and br are attracting increasing attention in pec due to the formation of reactive halide species rhs li et al 2013 xiao et al 2016 in the pec system using tio2 as the photoanode h is generated on the surface of tio2 under irradiation which further derives hydroxyl radicals oh in the presence of cl and br h or oh will react with them and generate rhs rhs include molecular ones i e free chlorine fc and free bromine and radical rhs i e cl cl2 and br these rhs are generally less reactive than h or oh which might lower the mineralization rate of organics in roc bagastyo et al 2012 however some rhs have the preference to attack electron rich moieties selectively enhancing the oxidation of certain organics grebel et al 2010 additionally the mediation of rhs could unleash the heterogeneous reactions on tio2 surface to homogeneous ones in bulk solution via diffusion of fc or series of reactions initiated by radical rhs barazesh et al 2016 ji et al 2017 the presence of radical reactive chlorine species r rcs in pec was evidenced by electron spin resonance xiao et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 su et al 2016 reported that r rcs derived from oh could overwhelm oh by up to 3 orders at steady state however these aforementioned studies were conducted in synthetic wastewater in real wastewater the formation of oxidants is more complicated because of the complex wastewater matrix therefore there is a need to profile the primary oxidants when pec was applied to the real wastewater roc contains abundant cl 217 9000 mg l and some br 1 10 mg l azerrad et al 2016 birben et al 2017 hence we hypothesized that rhs could be generated during the pec oxidation of organics in roc the occurrence of rhs may raise the concern of forming halogenated oxidation byproducts more well known as disinfection byproducts dbps this has become one of the challenges to the electrochemical oxidation radjenovic and sedlak 2015 for example two types of regulated dbps trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas were detected in the electrochemical oxidation of organics in roc at hundreds or even thousands μg l umar et al 2015 during electrochemical oxidation it is reported that the indirect pathway involving fc played a vital role in the formation of dbps bagastyo et al 2012 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 more recently the dbps formation due to the radical rhs is gaining more attention in aops li et al 2016 yang et al 2016 the participation of radical rhs mediates the degradation pathways of organics deriving different precursors to alter the type and the yield of dbps in uv chlorine li et al 2011 moreover these radical rhs with high redox potentials i e e h cl 2 4 v e h cl2 2 0 v fang et al 2014 hasegawa and neta 1978 can quickly substitute into the organic molecules which do not react with fc in the dark forming halogenated intermediates oliver and carey 1977 remucal and manley 2016 however up to now the formation of dbps in pec process is scarcely studied this study aimed to investigate the removal of organics and the formation of dbps during photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of organics in roc the removal of organics was evaluated by recording the changes in dissolved organic carbon doc uv254 molecular weight as well as fluorescence emission excitation matrix eem the formation of dbps including four thms and six haas was monitored the influence of two critical operational parameters anodic potential and initial ph on both organics degradation and dbps formation were investigated additionally five pharmaceuticals were spiked into the real roc to verify their removal efficiencies during pec concentrations of three primary oxidants in the pec system oh fc and r rcs were profiled at different anodic potentials and initial phs 2 materials and methods 2 1 roc sample collection and electrode synthesis roc samples were collected from a local water reclamation plant in singapore in this water reclamation plant the secondary effluent from an anoxic aerobic membrane bioreactor is reclaimed by ro membranes fig s1 collected roc samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filters before characterization and reaction table 1 provides the water characteristics and the details of ion

photoanode ready for pec experiments 2 2 experimental procedures the pec batch experiments were conducted in a three electrode system fig s2 using the tio2 nta as the anode a stainless steel plate as the cathode and a saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode the reactor is an undivided rectangle quartz tank capable of containing 150 ml solution a 30 min preliminary adsorption was conducted in the dark without external charge a 365 nm uva led lamp taoyuan hong kong equipped with a water cooling system was used as the light source the light intensity was around 13 3 mw cm2 as measured by a photometer il1400a international light u s a the anodic potential was controlled by the potentiostat pp201 zahner germany the initial ph was adjusted by adding small amounts of h2so4 or naoh samples were taken at desired time intervals and quenched by excess na2so3 before analyzing the concentrations of organics and dbps the default anodic potential was 1 0 v and the default initial ph was the original ph of roc ph 8 unless specified in the experiments studying the effects of anodic potential and initial ph the reaction was terminated after 120 min 2 3 analytical methods doc was

detector and a capillary column hp 5 30 m 0 32 mm inner diameter 0 25 μm film thickness agilent u s a one way analysis of variance anova was employed to test any significant difference of the dbps concentrations it should be noted that the concentration of tbm was below the detection limit 0 5 μg l in any of the studied cases hence it was excluded from the presented results five selected pharmaceuticals acetaminophen ace atenolol atl carbamazepine cbz trimethoprim tmp and sulfamethoxazole smx were spiked into roc with the individual initial concentration of 0 7 μmol l the concentrations of pharmaceuticals were quantified by a lcms 8030 system shimadzu japan using a zorbax sb c18 column 2 1 150 mm particle size 3 5 μm agilent the mobile phase consisted of water 0 1 formic acid acetonitrile 20 80 v v at a flow rate of 0 25 ml min nitrobenzene nb was adopted as the oh probe and its concentration was quantified by hplc agilent u s a the same column in lcms was used

text s1 in si 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidation of organics 3 1 1 reduction of doc and uv254 the concentrations of doc consistently decreased during pec of roc reaching a removal rate of 63 at 180 min fig 1 a this mineralization rate was comparable to the reported 36 75 in the electrochemical oxidation of organics in roc bagastyo et al 2014 2012 chaplin et al 2010 dialynas et al 2008 the mineralization rates of organics in roc by photocatalysis were reported of 49 with uva dialynas et al 2008 and 80 with uvc westerhoff et al 2009 the residue doc concentration was dramatically decreased when anodic potential increased from 0 to 1 0 v above 1 0 v a continued but less profound decrease of residue doc concentration was observed fig 1b the anodic potential applied in pec primarily aims to separate the h e pairs once the separation was sufficient the further increase of anodic potential showed less enhancement on the pec oxidation garcia segura and brillas 2017 liu et al 2019 the acidic initial ph benefited the reduction of doc with mineralization rates at ph 4 6 57 61 higher than those at ph 7 9 38 43 fig 1c in a pec ozone hybrid system the mineralization rate of textile wastewater was reported higher at ph 3 than that at ph 8 cardoso et al 2016 the enhancement from acidic ph was resulted from the facilitated adsorption of organics onto tio2 surface as well as the strengthened yield of oxidants cardoso et al 2016 su et al 2016 similarly elevating anodic potential or lowering initial ph benefited the reduction of uv254 fig 1a c compared to the mineralization the reduction of uv254 under the same condition was faster with the highest removal rate of 72 at 180 min the faster reduction of uv254 than mineralization was widely reported during the roc oxidation by aops umar et al 2015 uv254 indicates the aromaticity of organics so the faster reduction of uv254 than mineralization suggests the favorable oxidation of aromatic organics in roc gur reznik et al 2011 westerhoff et al 2009 3 1 2 molecular weight shift of organics according to the results of lc ocd hydrophilic organics accounted for the majority of doc 90 and the shifts of the five fractions of hydrophilic organics with reaction time are displayed in fig 2 a and b in the original roc humic substances dominated with a proportion of 89 while biopolymers and lmw neutrals accounted for 2 and 9 respectively during pec biopolymers and humic substances were transformed to the fractions with smaller molecular weight this transformation could be divided into two phases in the first 30 min humic substances were quickly degraded resulting in the elevated concentrations of building blocks and lmw neutrals from 30 min onward the concentrations of all fractions except lmw acids progressively decreased besides the proportional change of individual fraction was more significant in the first 30 min fig 2b the results suggest that the large organics in roc tended to breakdown first followed by comparable reduction rates of both large and small molecules liu et al 2012 umar et al 2014 the effects of anodic potential fig 2c and d and initial ph fig 2e and f on the reduction of humic substances were similar to their effects on mineralization since humic substances were the primary fraction of doc from ph 6 to 4 although the reduction rates of total hydrophilic carbons varied little 4 the distributions of hydrophilic carbon fractions shifted the proportion of humic substances dropped by 8 with ph declining from 6 to 4 leading to an increased proportion of lmw fractions lmw neutrals and lmw acids furthermore the percentage of lmw fractions was increased at higher anodic potentials fig 2d or lower initial phs fig 2f suggesting the higher generation of final byproducts under these conditions the lmw fractions were recognized as the final byproducts resulting from the incomplete mineralization of organics in chlorination hua and reckhow 2008 3 1 3 reduction of fluorescence as the reaction proceeded the eem spectra progressively shrunk with declining intensity fig s3 in the original roc fa and ha were the dominant fractions accounting for 28 and 27 of the total fluorescence respectively fig 3 a and b after 180 min the concentrations of both fa and ha were dramatically reduced the proportion of fa dropped by 15 while the proportion of ha increased by 4 this suggests a faster degradation of fa than ha which was observed in the uv h2o2 as well liu et al 2012 fa and ha have a high degree of conjugation and their removals were reported to correlate with decolorization as well as the improvement of biodegradability liu et al 2012 smp and ap1 with the lowest intensity were slowly degraded resulting in their elevated proportions at 180 min as presented in fig 3c and d increasing anodic potential from 0 to 3 0 v accelerated the removal rate of fluorescence from 68 to 94 where the change of fluorescence removal rate became smaller at 1 0 v the fewer proportions of fa at 1 0 v were due to its faster reduction than other fractions at initial ph 4 9 the fluorescence was reduced to comparable levels with removal rates 92 fig 3e unexpectedly the residue intensities of fluorescence at ph 8 and 9 were slightly lower than those at other phs this may be due to the fluorescence quenching from the precipitation of metal ions at alkaline conditions henderson et al 2009 the proportion of eem fractions similarly distributed fig 3f suggesting the similar reducing rate of individual eem fraction under different phs 3 1 4 decomposition of pharmaceuticals fig 4 a and b presents the observed pseudo 1st order kinetic rate constants k obs of five pharmaceuticals in roc increasing the anodic potential continuously accelerated the decomposition of pharmaceuticals with all k obs increased by 2 5 times from 0 to 3 0 v lowering initial ph generally resulted in rising k obs of pharmaceuticals where the k obs were promoted by 50 82 from ph 8 to 4 fig 4b acidic ph was reported to benefit the pec decomposition of some pharmaceuticals in synthetic wastewater such as ofloxacin liu et al 2016 sulfamethoxazole su et al 2016 and 5 fluorouracil mazierski et al 2019 from ph 8 to 9 the k obs of tmp and ace almost doubled this might be related to the increased affinity of anionic forms of tmp and ace pk a tmp 7 1 pk a ace 9 4 toward the positively charged tio2 nta anode at ph 9 among different pharmaceuticals the removals of tmp ace and smx were generally higher than those of atl and cbz under different anodic potentials and phs these five pharmaceuticals have similar bimolecular rate constants with the non selective oh 2 109 9 109 m 1s 1 barazesh et al 2016 and the differences in k obs may suggest the participation of some selective oxidants under these conditions the selective oxidants such as rcs could preferentially attack the strong electron donating moieties like the deprotonated amine in tmp the phenolic groups in ace and the aniline in smx barazesh et al 2016 3 2 concentrations of primary oxidants to better understand the effects of anodic potential and initial ph on the oxidation of organics in roc the oxidant profiles under varied anodic potentials and initial phs were discussed given the complexity of roc matrix it is challenging to identify all oxidant species in this system therefore three types of primary oxidants oh r rcs and fc were quantified as shown in fig 5 a oh ss increased with anodic potential from 0 to 1 0 v then stablized at 4 89 10 14 m at 1 0 v r rcs ss was constantly lower than oh ss by two orders the stable concentration of radicals at 1 0 v suggested the sufficient separation of h e pairs on tio2 another reason limiting the increase of oh ss at high anodic potentials could be the o2 evolution which competes with the generation of oh mazierski et al 2019 wei et al 2017 however the concentration of fc continuously increased with increasing anodic potential reaching 39 4 mg l at 3 0 v in pec fc is generated from recombination of r rcs eqs 1 3 or direct electron donation from cl to the anode eq 4 the increasing anodic potential greatly accelerated the later pathway this result was supported by the observed initial current where the initial current was elevated with increasing anodic potential fig s6 1 2 c l c l 2 2 2 c l 2 c l 2 2 c l 3 c l c l 2 c l 2 c l 4 2 c l c l 2 2 e 5 c l 2 h 2 o h o c l h c l 6 h o c l h o c l as seen in fig 5b oh ss at ph 4 6 were generally higher than that at ph 7 9 the unfavored formation of oh at ph 7 was likely due to the quenching effects of alkaline roc matrix azerrad et al 2014 in alkaline conditions inorganic carbons including hco3 and co3 2 could quickly react with oh at biomolecular rate constants of 8 5 106 and 3 9 108 m 1s 1 respectively grebel et al 2010 lowering ph to acidic conditions transformed most co3 2 and hco3 into h2co3 which is not readily reactive with oh buxton et al 1988 as a result oh ss was higher at acidic ph from ph 9 to 4 r rcs ss rose dramatically from 3 61 10 16 m to 7 39 10 12 m correspondingly the ratio of r rcs ss oh ss increased from 0 01 at ph 9 to 145 at ph 4 this massive shift reveals that the formation of r rcs was closely related to the initial ph at ph 7 the total concentrations of radicals were higher and r rcs dominated over oh however at ph 7 the total concentration of radicals was relatively low with oh the dominant radical species in addition more fc was formed under acidic conditions this was mainly due to the conversion of abundant r rcs via eqs 1 3 instead of eq 4 since the initial current changed slightly during initial ph 4 9 fig s6 beside of the concentration the initial ph affected the form of fc eqs 5 and 6 fc mainly existed in the form of hocl at ph 4 7 and in the form of ocl at alkaline ph li et al 2016 hocl is a stronger oxidant compared to ocl therefore the increased portions of hocl also contributed to the higher oxidation efficiency at acidic phs the changes in the oxidant profiles under different anodic potentials and initial phs contributed to the differences in oxidations of bulk organics and pharmaceuticals in the series of experiments with different anodic potentials the trend of oh ss was in accordance with the changes of doc uv254 molecular weight and fluorescence the increasing oh ss matched the raising reductions of these bulk organics from 0 to 1 0 v and the stable oh ss was consistent to the slightly changed reduction rates of bulk organics at 1 0 v this indicates that the reductions of bulk organics were mainly resulted from oh although rcs was subordinate in the oxidation of bulk organics the continuously formed fc with increasing anodic potential prominently benefited the decompositions of pharmaceuticals notably faster removals of tmp ace and smx than cbz and atl were attributed to their different reaction rates with fc 101 102 m 1s 1 for tmp ace and smx 10 2 10 1 m 1s 1 for cbz and atl barazesh et al 2016 in the series of experiments with changing initial ph the higher oh ss at ph 4 6 was consistent with the faster mineralization of roc under acidic conditions the higher concentrations of r rcs and fc at lower ph slightly contributed to the promoted mineralization this was in accordance with the mineralization of roc in the electrochemical process where the vast rcs under acidic conditions barely enhanced the mineralization bagastyo et al 2012 on the other hand the continuously increasing formation of r rcs and fc with reducing initial ph accelerated the breakdown of large organics as well as the decompositions of pharmaceuticals 3 3 formation of dbps as seen in fig 6 a the total concentration of dbps increased with reaction time to 6 29 μmol l at 90 min followed by a descend to 5 41 μmol l at 180 min the descend of dbps at prolonged reaction time was due to the further breakdown of dbps the dbps concentrations obtained from this study were lower than that 25 μmol l reported in the electrochemical oxidation of organics in roc bagastyo et al 2012 the higher concentration of dbps in their study was resulted from the higher initial doc 42 mg l and more abundant fc 250 mg l as supported by another study higher yield of fc resulted in a higher concentration of dbps bagastyo et al 2011 haas was more abundant than thms taking up 61 76 of the total dbp concentration the primary species of haas was mbaa with the highest concentration of 3 09 μmol l at 90 min the formation of brominated dbps suggests the participation of reactive bromine species which could be generated from the br in roc 1 5 mg l table s1 differently bagastyo et al 2012 2011 reported the chlorinated haas as the primary haas in roc this discrepancy might come from the three times higher br cl ratio of roc in this study than theirs the more active participation of br could contribute to the higher generation of brominated dbps gao et al 2019 among thms tcm was the dominant species with its concentration continuously rising to 1 95 μmol l at 180 min tcm was identified as the primary thm during pec disinfection of e coli with the presence of humic acids selcuk 2010 the formation of dbps was promoted at higher anodic potentials with the highest concentration of total dbps of 11 09 μmol l at 3 0 v fig 6b the high concentration of dbps at 1 0 v was attributed to the abundant fc fig 5a which scarcely benefited the mineralization of organics but boosted the formation of dbps besides these dbps could be the byproducts comprising of lmw fractions fig 2d which were reported to positively correlate with thms and haas during chlorination tian et al 2013 for haas the concentrations of mcaa mbaa and tcaa increased significantly p 0 05 from 0 5 to 1 0 v however from 1 0 to 3 0 v all the haa species insignificantly changed p 0 05 the formation of thms continuously increased with increasing anodic potential where the concentrations of tcm and bdcm increased significantly p 0 05 from 0 5 to 1 0 v and the concentrations of all thms increased significantly from 1 0 to 3 0 v p 0 05 as presented in fig 6c more dbps were generated at ph 4 6 7 33 7 93 μmol l than those at ph 7 9 5 64 6 01 μmol l this is associated with the more active participation of rhs in the oxidation of organics in roc all haas except mcaa insignificantly changed p 0 05 when the initial ph decreased from 9 to 7 further decreasing the initial ph to 4 resulted in significant changes of all haas p 0 05 four haas including mcaa dcaa bcaa and dbaa increased with decreasing ph while mbaa and tcaa decreased at lower ph these contrary changes of different haas toward acidifying ph may be related to their different preferential precursors for example contrary trends of dcaa and tcaa were frequently reported li et al 2011 2016 sun et al 2009 dcaa was favored by precursors with carboxyl or alcohol hydroxyl groups while tcaa preferred complicated structures including conjugated double bonds and phenolic hydroxyl li et al 2011 2016 sun et al 2009 the dominant thms was tcm and its concentration insignificantly changed p 0 05 at different phs promoted formation of thms at alkaline phs was reported in uv chlorine gao et al 2019 and chlorination liu and croué 2016 nikolaou et al 2004 due to the base catalyzed hydrolysis of intermediates to thms in current study the high concentration of rcs under acidic conditions enhanced the formation of dbps which might counterbalance the promotion from alkaline conditions 4 conclusions pec was applied to a municipal roc with emphases on the effects of anodic potential and initial ph on the reduction of organics as well as the formation of dbps the highest organics mineralization rate of 63 was achieved with a total dbp formation of 5 41 μmol l increasing anodic potential from 0 to 1 0 v accelerated the organics oxidation and the dbp formation due to the increased generation of primary oxidants at anodic potential higher than 1 0 v the slightly changed oh ss and r rcs ss marginally promoted the mineralization but the continuous increase of fc resulted in increased formation of dbps the acidic initial ph enhanced organics oxidation as well as dbps formation since the primary oxidants oh r rcs and fc were all promoted under acidic phs the results of this study revealed that the abundant halide ions in roc benefited the reduction of organics by pec but raised the concern of dbps therefore the operational conditions should be carefully optimized to control the formation of dbps during roc treatment by pec declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

18404,the high content of organics in municipal reverse osmosis concentrate roc requires proper treatment here this study applied the photoelectrocatalysis pec to reduce the concentration of organics in roc meanwhile the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps was investigated participation of primary oxidants in organics removal and dbps formation was revealed at different anodic potentials and phs the results showed that pec process effectively oxidized the organics in roc achieving the highest mineralization rate of 63 increasing anodic potential from 0 to 1 0 v enhanced the oxidations of bulk organics i e dissolved organic carbons doc uv254 fluorescence large molecular weight compounds and trace level pharmaceuticals raising anodic potential to higher than 1 0 v slightly benefited the oxidations of bulk organics owing to the relatively stable formation of hydroxyl radicals oh and radical reactive chlorine species r rcs the continuously rising concentration of free chlorine fc accelerated the decompositions of pharmaceuticals at 1 0 v however the generated fc raised the concentration of dbps up to 10 36 μmol l at 3 0 v lowering initial ph from 7 9 to 4 6 improved the mineralization rates by around 20 due to the higher formation of oh at ph 4 6 further decreasing initial ph from 6 to 4 enhanced the breakdown of large molecular weight compounds as well as the decomposition of pharmaceuticals this came from the strengthened formation of fc and r rcs at lower phs the intense participation of fc and r rcs resulted in a higher total dbp concentration at ph 4 6 than that at ph 7 9 however the individual species of dbps changed differently toward the ph shift the results of this study show that pec could be an alternative for organics oxidation in roc with

wastewater reuses pérez gonzález et al 2012 during the ro process the contaminants are concentrated in ro concentrate roc taking up around 20 30 of the feed water umar et al 2015 given high salinity and abundant recalcitrant organics in roc direct discharge or improper management can result in adverse environmental effects pérez gonzález et al 2012 pooi et al 2019 sun et al 2014 besides the bulk organics in roc particular attention should be paid to the micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals pharmaceuticals in the effluents of wastewater treatment plants are concentrated several times to hundreds or thousands of ng l in roc jamil et al 2019 wei et al 2015 the removals of trace levels of pharmaceuticals suffer from the great quenching effect of the water matrix li and hu 2018 2016 yang et al 2016 therefore the removal efficiency of pharmaceuticals in roc other than bulk organics should be additionally verified advanced oxidation processes aops have been proven efficient in degrading both bulk organics and micropollutants in roc umar et al 2015 among aops photoelectrocatalysis pec is a potential alternative for roc treatment the high salinity of roc ensures sufficient conductivity for pec to proceed pec is effective in removing humic acids selcuk and bekbolet 2008 pharmaceuticals liu et al 2019 su et al 2016 xiao et al 2015 ammonia ji et al 2017 xiao et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 and microorganisms pires et al 2016 selcuk 2010 sun et al 2016 however in previous studies pec was mostly applied in synthetic wastewater with relatively simple water matrix the application of pec in real wastewater is still limited and has yet been attempted for the roc treatment garcia segura and brillas 2017 recently the roles of halide ions such as cl and br are attracting increasing attention in pec due to the formation of reactive halide species rhs li et al 2013 xiao et al 2016 in the pec system using tio2 as the photoanode h is generated on the surface of tio2 under irradiation which further derives hydroxyl radicals oh in the presence of cl and br h or oh will react with them and generate rhs rhs include molecular ones i e free chlorine fc and free bromine and radical rhs i e cl cl2 and br these rhs are generally less reactive than h or oh which might lower the mineralization rate of organics in roc bagastyo et al 2012 however some rhs have the preference to attack electron rich moieties selectively enhancing the oxidation of certain organics grebel et al 2010 additionally the mediation of rhs could unleash the heterogeneous reactions on tio2 surface to homogeneous ones in bulk solution via diffusion of fc or series of reactions initiated by radical rhs barazesh et al 2016 ji et al 2017 the presence of radical reactive chlorine species r rcs in pec was evidenced by electron spin resonance xiao et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 su et al 2016 reported that r rcs derived from oh could overwhelm oh by up to 3 orders at steady state however these aforementioned studies were conducted in synthetic wastewater in real wastewater the formation of oxidants is more complicated because of the complex wastewater matrix therefore there is a need to profile the primary oxidants when pec was applied to the real wastewater roc contains abundant cl 217 9000 mg l and some br 1 10 mg l azerrad et al 2016 birben et al 2017 hence we hypothesized that rhs could be generated during the pec oxidation of organics in roc the occurrence of rhs may raise the concern of forming halogenated oxidation byproducts more well known as disinfection byproducts dbps this has become one of the challenges to the electrochemical oxidation radjenovic and sedlak 2015 for example two types of regulated dbps trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas were detected in the electrochemical oxidation of organics in roc at hundreds or even thousands μg l umar et al 2015 during electrochemical oxidation it is reported that the indirect pathway involving fc played a vital role in the formation of dbps bagastyo et al 2012 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 more recently the dbps formation due to the radical rhs is gaining more attention in aops li et al 2016 yang et al 2016 the participation of radical rhs mediates the degradation pathways of organics deriving different precursors to alter the type and the yield of dbps in uv chlorine li et al 2011 moreover these radical rhs with high redox potentials i e e h cl 2 4 v e h cl2 2 0 v fang et al 2014 hasegawa and neta 1978 can quickly substitute into the organic molecules which do not react with fc in the dark forming halogenated intermediates oliver and carey 1977 remucal and manley 2016 however up to now the formation of dbps in pec process is scarcely studied this study aimed to investigate the removal of organics and the formation of dbps during photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of organics in roc the removal of organics was evaluated by recording the changes in dissolved organic carbon doc uv254 molecular weight as well as fluorescence emission excitation matrix eem the formation of dbps including four thms and six haas was monitored the influence of two critical operational parameters anodic potential and initial ph on both organics degradation and dbps formation were investigated additionally five pharmaceuticals were spiked into the real roc to verify their removal efficiencies during pec concentrations of three primary oxidants in the pec system oh fc and r rcs were profiled at different anodic potentials and initial phs 2 materials and methods 2 1 roc sample collection and electrode synthesis roc samples were collected from a local water reclamation plant in singapore in this water reclamation plant the secondary effluent from an anoxic aerobic membrane bioreactor is reclaimed by ro membranes fig s1 collected roc samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filters before characterization and reaction table 1 provides the water characteristics and the details of ion contents are presented in table s1 tio2 nanotube arrays tio2 nta electrode was synthesized by anodization the titanium foil 0 25 mm 4 cm 4 cm sigma aldrich was mechanically polished by sandpaper followed by sonication in acetone ethanol and deionized water respectively the preprocessed titanium foil was adopted as the anode together with a platinum plate as the cathode to synthesize the tio2 nta the electrolyte was a mixture comprised of 1 65 g l nh4f in glycol deionized water 9 1 v v after anodizing at 30 v for 16 h the amorphous tio2 was calcined at 450 c for 2 h to obtain the tio2 nta photoanode ready for pec experiments 2 2 experimental procedures the pec batch experiments were conducted in a three electrode system fig s2 using the tio2 nta as the anode a stainless steel plate as the cathode and a saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode the reactor is an undivided rectangle quartz tank capable of containing 150 ml solution a 30 min preliminary adsorption was conducted in the dark without external charge a 365 nm uva led lamp taoyuan hong kong equipped with a water cooling system was used as the light source the light intensity was around 13 3 mw cm2 as measured by a photometer il1400a international light u s a the anodic potential was controlled by the potentiostat pp201 zahner germany the initial ph was adjusted by adding small amounts of h2so4 or naoh samples were taken at desired time intervals and quenched by excess na2so3 before analyzing the concentrations of organics and dbps the default anodic potential was 1 0 v and the default initial ph was the original ph of roc ph 8 unless specified in the experiments studying the effects of anodic potential and initial ph the reaction was terminated after 120 min 2 3 analytical methods doc was measured by a toc analyzer toc vcsh shimadzu japan uv254 was detected by a uv vis spectrophotometer dr5000 hach u s a an ion chromatography 930 compact ic flex metrohm switzerland was used for analyzing the ion content of roc the fluorescence eem spectra were obtained by the cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer agilent technologies u s a with the sample doc of 5 mg l the slit was 5

aromatic proteins ap1 aromatic proteins ap2 fulvic acid like compounds fa soluble microbial product like compounds smp and humic acid like compounds ha respectively the molecular size distribution of hydrophilic organics was obtained by a lc ocd analyzer doc labor dr huber germany with 5 mg l doc with the molecular weight from high to low the five fractions of lc ocd are biopolymers 20000 g mol humic substances 1000 g mol building blocks 300 500 g mol low molecular weight lmw neutrals 350 g mol and lmw acids 350 g mol target dbps include four thms chloroform tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm and bromoform tbm and six haas chloroacetic acid mcaa bromoacetic acid mbaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa trichloroactic acid tcaa bromochloroactic acid bcaa and dibromoacetic acid dbaa table s2 dbps in the samples were extracted following the standard methods usepa 551 1 for thms and 552 3 for haas and quantified using a gas chromatography equipped with an electron capture detector and a capillary column hp 5 30 m 0 32 mm inner diameter 0 25 μm film thickness agilent u s a one way analysis of variance anova was employed to test any significant difference of the dbps concentrations it should be noted that the concentration of tbm was below the detection limit 0 5 μg l in any of the studied cases hence it was excluded from the presented results five selected pharmaceuticals acetaminophen ace atenolol atl carbamazepine cbz trimethoprim tmp and sulfamethoxazole smx were spiked into roc with the individual initial concentration of 0 7 μmol l the concentrations of pharmaceuticals were quantified by a lcms 8030 system shimadzu japan using a zorbax sb c18 column 2 1 150 mm particle size 3 5 μm agilent the mobile phase consisted of water 0 1 formic acid acetonitrile 20 80 v v at a flow rate of 0 25 ml min nitrobenzene nb was adopted as the oh probe and its concentration was quantified by hplc agilent u s a the same column in lcms was used with the mobile phase of water acetonitrile 40 60 v v at a flow rate of 0 20 ml min the detection wavelength was 260 nm fc concentration was measured using dpd n n diethyl p phenylenediamine colorimetric method by a colorimeter dr 890 hach u s a the obtained value was a summation of all fc forms cl2 hocl and ocl and small portions of other oxidants reactive to dpd such as free bromine and h2o2 the steady state concentration of oh oh ss was quantified via the degradation kinetics of nb which solely reacts with oh the steady state concentrations of r rcs r rcs ss was derived from oh ss text s1 in si 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidation of organics 3 1 1 reduction of doc and uv254 the concentrations of doc consistently decreased during pec of roc reaching a removal rate of 63 at 180 min fig 1 a this mineralization rate was comparable to the reported 36 75 in the electrochemical oxidation of organics in roc bagastyo et al 2014 2012 chaplin et al 2010 dialynas et al 2008 the mineralization rates of organics in roc by photocatalysis were reported of 49 with uva dialynas et al 2008 and 80 with uvc westerhoff et al 2009 the residue doc concentration was dramatically decreased when anodic potential increased from 0 to 1 0 v above 1 0 v a continued but less profound decrease of residue doc concentration was observed fig 1b the anodic potential applied in pec primarily aims to separate the h e pairs once the separation was sufficient the further increase of anodic potential showed less enhancement on the pec oxidation garcia segura and brillas 2017 liu et al 2019 the acidic initial ph benefited the reduction of doc with mineralization rates at ph 4 6 57 61 higher than those at ph 7 9 38 43 fig 1c in a pec ozone hybrid system the mineralization rate of textile wastewater was reported higher at ph 3 than that at ph 8 cardoso et al 2016 the enhancement from acidic ph was resulted from the facilitated adsorption of organics onto tio2 surface as well as the strengthened yield of oxidants cardoso et al 2016 su et al 2016 similarly elevating anodic potential or lowering initial ph benefited the reduction of uv254 fig 1a c compared to the mineralization the reduction of uv254 under the same condition was faster with the highest removal rate of 72 at 180 min the faster reduction of uv254 than mineralization was widely reported during the roc oxidation by aops umar et al 2015 uv254 indicates the aromaticity of organics so the faster reduction of uv254 than mineralization suggests the favorable oxidation of aromatic organics in roc gur reznik et al 2011 westerhoff et al 2009 3 1 2 molecular weight shift of organics according to the results of lc ocd hydrophilic organics accounted for the majority of doc 90 and the shifts of the five fractions of hydrophilic organics with reaction time are displayed in fig 2 a and b in the original roc humic substances dominated with a proportion of 89 while biopolymers and lmw neutrals accounted for 2 and 9 respectively during pec biopolymers and humic substances were transformed to the fractions with smaller molecular weight this transformation could be divided into two phases in the first 30 min humic substances were quickly degraded resulting in the elevated concentrations of building blocks and lmw neutrals from 30 min onward the concentrations of all fractions except lmw acids progressively decreased besides the proportional change of individual fraction was more significant in the first 30 min fig 2b the results suggest that the large organics in roc tended to breakdown first followed by comparable reduction rates of both large and small molecules liu et al 2012 umar et al 2014 the effects of anodic potential fig 2c and d and initial ph fig 2e and f on the reduction of humic substances were similar to their effects on mineralization since humic substances were the primary fraction of doc from ph 6 to 4 although the reduction rates of total hydrophilic carbons varied little 4 the distributions of hydrophilic carbon fractions shifted the proportion of humic substances dropped by 8 with ph declining from 6 to 4 leading to an increased proportion of lmw fractions lmw neutrals and lmw acids furthermore the percentage of lmw fractions was increased at higher anodic potentials fig 2d or lower initial phs fig 2f suggesting the higher generation of final byproducts under these conditions the lmw fractions were recognized as the final byproducts resulting from the incomplete mineralization of organics in chlorination hua and reckhow 2008 3 1 3 reduction of fluorescence as the reaction proceeded the eem spectra progressively shrunk with declining intensity fig s3 in the original roc fa and ha were the dominant fractions accounting for 28 and 27 of the total fluorescence respectively fig 3 a and b after 180 min the concentrations of both fa and ha were dramatically reduced the proportion of fa dropped by 15 while the proportion of ha increased by 4 this suggests a faster degradation of fa than ha which was observed in the uv h2o2 as well liu et al 2012 fa and ha have a high degree of conjugation and their removals were reported to correlate with decolorization as well as the improvement of biodegradability liu et al 2012 smp and ap1 with the lowest intensity were slowly degraded resulting in their elevated proportions at 180 min as presented in fig 3c and d increasing anodic potential from 0 to 3 0 v accelerated the removal rate of fluorescence from 68 to 94 where the change of fluorescence removal rate became smaller at 1 0 v the fewer proportions of fa at 1 0 v were due to its faster reduction than other fractions at initial ph 4 9 the fluorescence was reduced to comparable levels with removal rates 92 fig 3e unexpectedly the residue intensities of fluorescence at ph 8 and 9 were slightly lower than those at other phs this may be due to the fluorescence quenching from the precipitation of metal ions at alkaline conditions henderson et al 2009 the proportion of eem fractions similarly distributed fig 3f suggesting the similar reducing rate of individual eem fraction under different phs 3 1 4 decomposition of pharmaceuticals fig 4 a and b presents the observed pseudo 1st order kinetic rate constants k obs of five pharmaceuticals in roc increasing the anodic potential continuously accelerated the decomposition of pharmaceuticals with all k obs increased by 2 5 times from 0 to 3 0 v lowering initial ph generally resulted in rising k obs of pharmaceuticals where the k obs were promoted by 50 82 from ph 8 to 4 fig 4b acidic ph was reported to benefit the pec decomposition of some pharmaceuticals in synthetic wastewater such as ofloxacin liu et al 2016 sulfamethoxazole su et al 2016 and 5 fluorouracil mazierski et al 2019 from ph 8 to 9 the k obs of tmp and ace almost doubled this might be related to the increased affinity of anionic forms of tmp and ace pk a tmp 7 1 pk a ace 9 4 toward the positively charged tio2 nta anode at ph 9 among different pharmaceuticals the removals of tmp ace and smx were generally higher than those of atl and cbz under different anodic potentials and phs these five pharmaceuticals have similar bimolecular rate constants with the non selective oh 2 109 9 109 m 1s 1 barazesh et al 2016 and the differences in k obs may suggest the participation of some selective oxidants under these conditions the selective oxidants such as rcs could preferentially attack the strong electron donating moieties like the deprotonated amine in tmp the phenolic groups in ace and the aniline in smx barazesh et al 2016 3 2 concentrations of primary oxidants to better understand the effects of anodic potential and initial ph on the oxidation of organics in roc the oxidant profiles under varied anodic potentials and initial phs were discussed given the complexity of roc matrix it is challenging to identify all oxidant species in this system therefore three types of primary oxidants oh r rcs and fc were quantified as shown in fig 5 a oh ss increased with anodic potential from 0 to 1 0 v then stablized at 4 89 10 14 m at 1 0 v r rcs ss was constantly lower than oh ss by two orders the stable concentration of radicals at 1 0 v suggested the sufficient separation of h e pairs on tio2 another reason limiting the increase of oh ss at high anodic potentials could be the o2 evolution which competes with the generation of oh mazierski et al 2019 wei et al 2017 however the concentration of fc continuously increased with increasing anodic potential reaching 39 4 mg l at 3 0 v in pec fc is generated from recombination of r rcs eqs 1 3 or direct electron donation from cl to the anode eq 4 the increasing anodic potential greatly accelerated the later pathway this result was supported by the observed initial current where the initial current was elevated with increasing anodic potential fig s6 1 2 c l c l 2 2 2 c l 2 c l 2 2 c l 3 c l c l 2 c l 2 c l 4 2 c l c l 2 2 e 5 c l 2 h 2 o h o c l h c l 6 h o c l h o c l as seen in fig 5b oh ss at ph 4 6 were generally higher than that at ph 7 9 the unfavored formation of oh at ph 7 was likely due to the quenching effects of alkaline roc matrix azerrad et al 2014 in alkaline conditions inorganic carbons including hco3 and co3 2 could quickly react with oh at biomolecular rate constants of 8 5 106 and 3 9 108 m 1s 1 respectively grebel et al 2010 lowering ph to acidic conditions transformed most co3 2 and hco3 into h2co3 which is not readily reactive with oh buxton et al 1988 as a result oh ss was higher at acidic ph from ph 9 to 4 r rcs ss rose dramatically from 3 61 10 16 m to 7 39 10 12 m correspondingly the ratio of r rcs ss oh ss increased from 0 01 at ph 9 to 145 at ph 4 this massive shift reveals that the formation of r rcs was closely related to the initial ph at ph 7 the total concentrations of radicals were higher and r rcs dominated over oh however at ph 7 the total concentration of radicals was relatively low with oh the dominant radical species in addition more fc was formed under acidic conditions this was mainly due to the conversion of abundant r rcs via eqs 1 3 instead of eq 4 since the initial current changed slightly during initial ph 4 9 fig s6 beside of the concentration the initial ph affected the form of fc eqs 5 and 6 fc mainly existed in the form of hocl at ph 4 7 and in the form of ocl at alkaline ph li et al 2016 hocl is a stronger oxidant compared to ocl therefore the increased portions of hocl also contributed to the higher oxidation efficiency at acidic phs the changes in the oxidant profiles under different anodic potentials and initial phs contributed to the differences in oxidations of bulk organics and pharmaceuticals in the series of experiments with different anodic potentials the trend of oh ss was in accordance with the changes of doc uv254 molecular weight and fluorescence the increasing oh ss matched the raising reductions of these bulk organics from 0 to 1 0 v and the stable oh ss was consistent to the slightly changed reduction rates of bulk organics at 1 0 v this indicates that the reductions of bulk organics were mainly resulted from oh although rcs was subordinate in the oxidation of bulk organics the continuously formed fc with increasing anodic potential prominently benefited the decompositions of pharmaceuticals notably faster removals of tmp ace and smx than cbz and atl were attributed to their different reaction rates with fc 101 102 m 1s 1 for tmp ace and smx 10 2 10 1 m 1s 1 for cbz and atl barazesh et al 2016 in the series of experiments with changing initial ph the higher oh ss at ph 4 6 was consistent with the faster mineralization of roc under acidic conditions the higher concentrations of r rcs and fc at lower ph slightly contributed to the promoted mineralization this was in accordance with the mineralization of roc in the electrochemical process where the vast rcs under acidic conditions barely enhanced the mineralization bagastyo et al 2012 on the other hand the continuously increasing formation of r rcs and fc with reducing initial ph accelerated the breakdown of large organics as well as the decompositions of pharmaceuticals 3 3 formation of dbps as seen in fig 6 a the total concentration of dbps increased with reaction time to 6 29 μmol l at 90 min followed by a descend to 5 41 μmol l at 180 min the descend of dbps at prolonged reaction time was due to the further breakdown of dbps the dbps concentrations obtained from this study were lower than that 25 μmol l reported in the electrochemical oxidation of organics in roc bagastyo et al 2012 the higher concentration of dbps in their study was resulted from the higher initial doc 42 mg l and more abundant fc 250 mg l as supported by another study higher yield of fc resulted in a higher concentration of dbps bagastyo et al 2011 haas was more abundant than thms taking up 61 76 of the total dbp concentration the primary species of haas was mbaa with the highest concentration of 3 09 μmol l at 90 min the formation of brominated dbps suggests the participation of reactive bromine species which could be generated from the br in roc 1 5 mg l table s1 differently bagastyo et al 2012 2011 reported the chlorinated haas as the primary haas in roc this discrepancy might come from the three times higher br cl ratio of roc in this study than theirs the more active participation of br could contribute to the higher generation of brominated dbps gao et al 2019 among thms tcm was the dominant species with its concentration continuously rising to 1 95 μmol l at 180 min tcm was identified as the primary thm during pec disinfection of e coli with the presence of humic acids selcuk 2010 the formation of dbps was promoted at higher anodic potentials with the highest concentration of total dbps of 11 09 μmol l at 3 0 v fig 6b the high concentration of dbps at 1 0 v was attributed to the abundant fc fig 5a which scarcely benefited the mineralization of organics but boosted the formation of dbps besides these dbps could be the byproducts comprising of lmw fractions fig 2d which were reported to positively correlate with thms and haas during chlorination tian et al 2013 for haas the concentrations of mcaa mbaa and tcaa increased significantly p 0 05 from 0 5 to 1 0 v however from 1 0 to 3 0 v all the haa species insignificantly changed p 0 05 the formation of thms continuously increased with increasing anodic potential where the concentrations of tcm and bdcm increased significantly p 0 05 from 0 5 to 1 0 v and the concentrations of all thms increased significantly from 1 0 to 3 0 v p 0 05 as presented in fig 6c more dbps were generated at ph 4 6 7 33 7 93 μmol l than those at ph 7 9 5 64 6 01 μmol l this is associated with the more active participation of rhs in the oxidation of organics in roc all haas except mcaa insignificantly changed p 0 05 when the initial ph decreased from 9 to 7 further decreasing the initial ph to 4 resulted in significant changes of all haas p 0 05 four haas including mcaa dcaa bcaa and dbaa increased with decreasing ph while mbaa and tcaa decreased at lower ph these contrary changes of different haas toward acidifying ph may be related to their different preferential precursors for example contrary trends of dcaa and tcaa were frequently reported li et al 2011 2016 sun et al 2009 dcaa was favored by precursors with carboxyl or alcohol hydroxyl groups while tcaa preferred complicated structures including conjugated double bonds and phenolic hydroxyl li et al 2011 2016 sun et al 2009 the dominant thms was tcm and its concentration insignificantly changed p 0 05 at different phs promoted formation of thms at alkaline phs was reported in uv chlorine gao et al 2019 and chlorination liu and croué 2016 nikolaou et al 2004 due to the base catalyzed hydrolysis of intermediates to thms in current study the high concentration of rcs under acidic conditions enhanced the formation of dbps which might counterbalance the promotion from alkaline conditions 4 conclusions pec was applied to a municipal roc with emphases on the effects of anodic potential and initial ph on the reduction of organics as well as the formation of dbps the highest organics mineralization rate of 63 was achieved with a total dbp formation of 5 41 μmol l increasing anodic potential from 0 to 1 0 v accelerated the organics oxidation and the dbp formation due to the increased generation of primary oxidants at anodic potential higher than 1 0 v the slightly changed oh ss and r rcs ss marginally promoted the mineralization but the continuous increase of fc resulted in increased formation of dbps the acidic initial ph enhanced organics oxidation as well as dbps formation since the primary oxidants oh r rcs and fc were all promoted under acidic phs the results of this study revealed that the abundant halide ions in roc benefited the reduction of organics by pec but raised the concern of dbps therefore the operational conditions should be carefully optimized to control the formation of dbps during roc treatment by pec declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the
