13545,this paper presents a novel systematic decomposition method for the synthesis of water network the main objective of this approach is to reduce the complexity of the water network by dividing the system into several clusters with optimisation constraints these constraints include lengths of pipeline total pipe lengths of the clusters etc the method was applied to both direct reuse recycle and water regeneration networks a literature example is used to demonstrate the novel approach the generated network alternatives were compared for their minimum fresh water and wastewater flowrates piping costs as well as the number of pipelines it is observed that the number of pipelines and the piping costs decrease when the system is divided into more clusters i e simpler network the results also show that when the complexity of the network decreases higher fresh water is observed for the direct reuse recycle case and higher regenerated flowrate for the case of water regeneration network both cases lead to higher operating and total annualised cost of the water networks hence there is a trade off between network complexity and water flowrates it is up to the plant engineers or designers to decide the level of complexity and water saving that they can accept keywords process integration process synthesis optimisation water minimisation network complexity nomenclatures sets

six fold over the past century 1 the global water use continues to grow at a yearly rate of 1 due to the increase of population economic development and shifting in consumption patterns 1 however it is estimated that about 785 million people are still lacking the basic drinking water services 1 hence it is important to have better water management strategy to reduce the water scarcity issues in various parts of the world if not eliminated in this regard water recycling and reuse technologies have been identified as a mean to achieve the united nation sustainable development goal un sdg goal 6 by year 2030 2 one of the established group of tools for water recovery system design in the process industry is process integration which may be defined as a holistic approach to design operation which emphasises the unity of the process 3 4 the first trend of process integration was initiated in 1970s for the synthesis of heat exchanger network hen 5 6 it was later extended into heat integration for various energy intensive processes 7 8 in the late 1980s second trend of process integration was initiated by el halwagi and manousiouthakis 9 for the synthesis of mass exchange network and later into various mass integration initiative 4 following the analogy of heat and mass transfer a special case of mass integration i e water minimisation was then developed by wang and smith 10 based on the insight based pinch analysis technique while earlier developments were dedicated for fixed load problems 10 11 various other methods developed in the beginning of the 21st century were meant for the fixed flowrate problems which is believe to be more generic these include various graphical 12 13 and algebraic targeting methods 14 for direct water reuse recycle scheme as well as for water regeneration network 15 16 pinch analysis techniques for water minimisation became very well established in the 21st century and can be found in review paper 17 textbooks 4 8 18 and industrial guidebook 19 apart from pinch analysis technique various mathematical programming techniques have been established for water minimisation the mathematical optimisation techniques address several limitations associated with pinch analysis techniques these include the handling of multiple contaminants 20 21 cost optimisation 22 24 flexible network 25 26 simultaneous energy and water integration 27 28 as well as water network retrofit 29 from the above review it can be noticed that very little attempts have been made to focus on structure optimisation of the water network when water minimisation is implemented for process plants especially for processes with extensive water using processes it normally results in complex piping system this may lead to controllability issue due to the decrease in its degree of freedom a less complex network is always desired as it will reduce operational and controllability issues of the process plant one of the earliest attempts to address structural problems for industrial water network was reported by olesen and polley 30 based on the problem decomposition method for heat exchanger network 31 the authors first grouped the water using processes in different geographical zones where water flowrate targeting is performed using pinch analysis water recovery is then performed across zones to reduce overall water flowrates the main limitation for this earlier work is that the water using processes were grouped into their respective zones with ac hoc decision i e no systematic approach was employed this may result in sub optimal flowrate targets in another recent work dedicated for flexible water network a three stage optimisation approach was proposed based on the extended corner point method 26 in the latter the flexible water network was first synthesised to achieve the minimum fresh water flowrate the network is then subjected to stage two and three optimisation in order to reduce its number of pipelines and its total piping length doing this allows the synthesised network to tolerate changes in its operating parameters e g fluctuating flowrates and or concentration and yet with simple network structure however the method is only demonstrated for networks with a small numbers of water using processes the method can be cumbersome when huge networks e g with 10 water using processes are handled it is also worth noting that similar problems have been addressed in other areas of work e g hen synthesis one of the earliest attempts to address structural optimisation problems for hen was reported by amidpour and polley 31 the latter presented the decomposition approach where the overall problem is decomposed into sub problems in a flowsheet and heat transfer between specific zones is limited in a later work escobar et al 32 proposed a two stage approach for the synthesis of flexible and controllable hen a design stage is first performed where design variables are chosen the control variables are then adjusted in the second stage during operation for the realisations of uncertain parameters the technique yields a hen design that can operate under varying conditions while achieving energy integration objective ng et al 33 on the other hand decomposed an integrated hen by dividing its structure into several clusters to reduce its complexity a similar work by lam et al 34 reported a few model size reduction techniques for large scale biomass production and supply network which led to improvement in computational modelling time with little loss in accuracy in this work a superstructural model is developed for the synthesis of water network with reduced structure complexity the model considers piping length and number of piping connections in the water network water network synthesised with this model will have simpler structure as compared to those with other models which is the main novelty of this work the paper is structured as follows in the following section a problem statement is given the basic model for direct water reuse recycle is presented in the following section with a case study to elucidate the proposed model the model is next extended for water regeneration network where several types of water interception units are considered the case study is revisited to elucidate the extended model before conclusions are drawn for the paper 2 problem statement the superstructural representation for a direct reuse recycle network is given in fig 1 a with the following formal problem statement given a number of water consuming units in the process designated as process sink or skj j 1 2 3 n sk each sink requires a fixed requirement of water flowrate f s k j with a maximum concentration limit c s k j given a number of water generating units designated as process source or sri i 1 2 3 n sr each source has a fixed flowrate f s r i and a concentration c s r i each source can be sent for reuse recycle to the sinks the unutilised source s are sent for environmental discharge when the process source is insufficient for use by the sinks external fresh resource s with concentration c f w may be purchased to satisfy the requirement of sinks for a water regeneration network its superstructural representation is given in fig 1 b and the following is added to the problem statement given interception unit s of known performance the process source s is to be purified for use in the sinks the aim of this work is to propose a systematic decomposition strategy for an integrated water network to reduce its complexity a simpler network is desired to ease process operation 3 model formulation for direct reuse recycle in this section a superstructural model is proposed to synthesise a water network that consists of several independent sub networks or termed as cluster with the aim to segregate the process sources and sinks in the water network the model is mixed integer linear programming milp which is solved using gams v23 4 3 in this section the model is first presented for direct reuse recycle scheme 3 1 basic model formulation the basic model for a direct water reuse recycle network is modified from foo 18 to incorporate the new concept of clustering and has the following constraints each process water source i sri with flowrate f s r i may be allocated to the water sinks j skj in cluster clk in which its allocated flowrate is denoted as f s r i s k j c l k unutilised source would be directed as wastewater discharge with flowrate term f s r i w w eq 1 describes the overall flowrate balance for process source sri 1 s k j c l k f s r i s k j c l k f s r i w w f s r i s r i s r i each process water sink skj is fulfilled by process water sources f s r i s k j c l k or fresh water source with flowrate f f w s k j eq 2 describes the overall flowrate balance of the process sink skj 2 s r i c l k f s r i s k j c l k f f w s k j f s k j s k j s k j noted that no flow connection is to be built between the fresh water and wastewater discharge the total contaminant load from process source and fresh water should not exceed the maximum limit of each process sinks given by eq 3 3 s r i c l k f s r i s k j c l k c s r i f f w s k j c f w f s k j c s k j s k j s k j all variables of the superstructural model take a non negative value 4 f s r i s k j c l k f f w s k j f s r i w w 0 s k j s k j s r i s r i c l k c l k in order to incorporate piping and capital cost considerations a binary variable b s r i s k j c l k is introduced in the model to denote the presence and absence of water streams between sources sri and sinks skj in cluster clk the binary variable is activated using eq 5 5 f s r i s k j c l k m b s r i s k j c l k s k j s k j s r i s r i c l k c l k where m is an arbitrary large value the piping capital cost cc correlation includes a variation term a and a fixed term c as shown in eq 6 the coefficient a accounts for the linear impact of flowrate on the capital cost of piping whilst the fixed term c is a constant value that describes the basic capital cost contribution the capital cost is directly affected by the distance or length of the connections between the process water source and sink d s r i s k j c l k 6 c c s r i s k j c l k a f s r i s k j c l k c b s r i s k j c l k d s r i s k j c l k operating cost oc takes into consideration the costs of fresh water with unit cost ctfw and waste discharge with unit cost ctww 7 o c s k j f f w s k j c t f w s r i f s r i w w c t w w the total annual cost tac is then calculated by eq 8 8 t a c o c a o t c c a f where aot is the annual operating time the annualising factor af is calculated using eq 9 that follows 8 9 a f i r 1 i r y 1 i r y 1 where ir is interest rate and y is the number of years considered for the analysis 3 2 systematic decomposition with clustering approach this section describes how the clustering concept is used to synthesise a water network with the aim to reduce its complexity different constraints such as reduced individual piping length reduced total pipe length in the clusters and forbidden matches among sources and sinks in the clusters may be added the total number of pipelines in the entire network is given by eq 10 10 n p s r i s k j c l k b s r i s k j c l k where np is the number of pipelines in a reuse recycle network which may be related directly as the complexity of the water network note however that the constraints should exclude the pipe connections for sources and wastewater matches as well as those for fresh water and sink matches as these connections do not contribute to the complexity of the water network the overall distance between water sinks and sources may be calculated as the modular sum of difference in each axis given as in eq 11 11 d s r i s k j x s r i x s k j y s r i y s k j where x and y are coordinates of the sinks and sources the distances are assumed to be straight lines parallel to x axis and y axis note that eq 11 is also used to calculate the distance between fresh water and water sinks as well as the distance between water sources and wastewater discharge the total length of the connecting pipelines between source sri and sink skj in cluster clk is given as d s r i s k j c l k in eq 12 12 d s r i s k j c l k b s r i s k j c l k d s r i s k j s k j s k j s r i s r i c l k c l k in the following sub sections two strategies are outlined based on the clustering concept on individual and total pipe lengths 3 2 1 clustering based on individual pipe length between sources and sinks the upper bound and lower bound for the individual pipe length of the pipeline are given by 13 d s r i s k j c l k d u b 0 c l k c l k 14 d s r i s k j c l k d l b 0 c l k c l k here d ub andd lb are the upper and lower bounds for the individual pipe length between the source and sink respectively the lower bound in eq 14 takes zero value as there may not be any connection between a source and a sink the following procedure is proposed to determine the upper bound for piping length in eq 13 i the total number of clusters is first determined ii the axis x or y axis with the broadest range is selected the selected axis is divided by the number of clusters into sections of equal width iii the furthest mean distance of a cluster d m e a n m a x between the mid point of the divided sections is then calculated see illustration in fig 2 iv eq 15 shows how the upper bound value in eq 13 is determined from the average between the furthest mean distance d m e a n m a x step iii with that of the longest piping length for the base case scenario d b c m a x the latter is the water integration case where no cluster is used to segregate the sinks and sources i e or all sinks and sources co exist in the same cluster 15 d u b d m e a n m a x d b c m a x 2 to illustrate step iii a simple example is given in fig 2 in which three clusters is assumed for a plant where its layout is given as shown the y axis for the plant layout is larger than the x axis and hence the y axis is divided into three sections of equal width the furthest mean distance for this case is determined as 228 m 447 27 36 36 2 2 661 82 63 64 3 2 2 the furthest mean distances calculated for the two clusters and four clusters scenario are 254 and 219 m respectively whilst the longest piping length used in eq 15 which is obtained from the base case scenario is 683 m 3 2 2 clustering based on the total pipe lengths of the pipelines in a cluster for a given cluster clk the total piping length p l c l k of the cluster is given by eq 16 16 p l c l k s r i s k j d s r i s k j c l k c l k c l k the upper and lower bounds for the total piping length may be defined for cluster clk to avoid the possibility of all the sources and sinks being allocated into the same cluster 17 p l c l k p l u b 0 c l k c l k 18 p l c l k p l l b 0 c l k c l k here pl ub and pl lb are the upper and lower bounds for the total piping length in the cluster the lower bounds of the clusters p l l b is determined based on the shortest distance between the source and sink d s r i s k j c l k m i n from the base case i e when water integration is performed without cluster consideration 19 p l l b d s r i s k j c l k m i n eq 19 ensures that the cluster has at least a piping connection in the cluster the upper bound p l u b are predetermined from the total network pipe length of the base case scenario which is 3623 m it shall be noted that the constraints for the clusters do not include the piping connections among the sources and wastewater discharge as well as those among freshwater and sinks as these connections are not a detriment to the robustness of the network the equation is given by eq 20 20 p l u b d s r i s k j n d s r i s k j c l k m i n where n is the total number of clusters defined as the maximum number of clusters is pre determined by the designers the model may sometimes opt for less number of clusters if the upper bounds of the individual piping length and total piping are not exceeded this will be shown with the illustrative example additional constraint for the number of pipelines is also introduced to achieve system complexity reduction by introducing an upper bound npub given as in eq 21 21 n p n p u b 3 2 3 incorporation of forbidden matches the interconnections between clusters are forbidden using eq 22 this is to ensure that the clusters are independent from each other which leads to a more robust network 22 s r i s k j c l k b s r i s k j c l k 1 s k j s k j s r i s r i c l k c l k when a source and sink is connected to one cluster eq 22 ensures that the consequent match with the connected source and sink belong to the same cluster the objective function for the model may be set to minimise the total annual cost tac given as in eq 23 subject to the constraints in eqs 1 22 when different clusters are to be formed note that when cluster is not considered the model may be solved with constraints in eqs 1 9 this will be shown in the following example 23 m i n i m i s e t a c 4 illustrative example the newly proposed superstructural model is illustrated using a modified literature example taken from savelski and bagajewicz 23 with limiting water data given in table 1 in the latter fictitious coordinates for these water using processes are also added the upper bound in eq 15 is determined using coordinates in table 1 see fig 2 for illustration with these coordinates data the pipe length required for water reuse recycle connections can be estimated besides the structural of the water network can also be determined with the coordinates when no water minimisation is carried out the mass flowrates for freshwater and the wastewater are both determined as 354 36 t h summation of flowrates in column 4 in table 1 additional information used for cost calculations in these scenarios are extracted from foo 18 i the cost of freshwater ctfw and wastewater ctww are both taken as 1 t ii the af in eq 9 is calculated using an interest rate of 5 for a period of 5 years hence the af has a value of 0 231 iii the aot is assumed as 8000 h iv the piping parameters in eq 6 are given as 2 a and 250 c respectively v fresh water source is assumed to be located at coordinates 0 0 while wastewater discharge is located at coordinates 500 700 vi the x and y coordinates of the sources are located 2 units after the x and y coordinates of the sinks to account for self recycling piping the milp models of all scenarios are solved using gams v23 4 3 for the base case situation scenario 1 the model is solved without considering the network structure it is then compared to scenario 2 where network structures are considered 4 1 scenario 1 base case in this base case scenario the milp model is solved by minimising the total annualised cost tac of the network with the optimisation objective in eq 23 subjected to the constraints set by eqs 1 9 for this scenario the number of clusters is taken as one which means that all water sinks and sources are assumed to be located in the same cluster in other words no restriction is enforced to segregate the water using processes the solution of the milp model yields a tac of 3 4 m y with both fresh water and wastewater flowrates identified as 167 1 t h see table 2 for other details the network structure of this scenario is shown in fig 3 note that the minimum fresh water and wastewater flowrates for this scenario is equal to that reported by savelski and bagajewicz 23 when fresh water flowrate was minimised however the latter work did not consider network structure hence no comparison can be made on that aspect for the water network in fig 3 there are 17 direct reuse recycle connections fresh water and wastewater connects are ignored 4 2 scenario 2 optimisation with consideration of network structure scenario 2 considers the proposed model in this work three cases are analysed with two three and four clusters respectively the model is solved by minimising the tac in eq 8 subject to the constraints in eqs 1 22 the upper and lower bounds for individual pipe length and total pipe length in the clusters needed in eqs 17 and 18 are tabulated in tables 3 and 4 note that the lower bound of pipe length in table 3 is set as 0 since the connection between sink and source is not guaranteed note also that the number of piping connections formed within the cluster is dependent on the upper and lower bounds of the piping length imposed in tables 3 and 4 in solving case 1 with 2 clusters the upper bound for maximum connection in eq 21 has been excluded this results in a water network with 13 connections as shown in fig 4 next the upper bounds of piping connections eq 21 in cases 2 and 3 were set to 11 and 9 i e 2 connections lower than earlier cases the resulted network for these cases are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively from figs 3 6 it is easily observed that the complexity of the water network decreases as more clusters are allowed as the water sources and sinks are segregated from each other note also that for fig 4 even though 2 clusters have been set for the model the resulting network shows 3 clusters are formed in this case disturbance caused by a water using process within a cluster will not affect the process located in another cluster this leads to better robustness of the overall network a comparison of the optimisation results is shown in fig 7 as shown lower number of connections are observed when more clusters are allowed for the water network note that the number of connections only accounts for the direct reuse recycle pipelines among the water sources and sinks and excludes the connections among fresh water feed and sinks as well as those among sources and wastewater discharge this is due to the fact that these connections are independent in which their fluctuations do not upset the water network directly since the number of connections reduces in water networks with more clusters the reduction of total piping length of the network is also observed as shown in fig 8 besides fig 7 also shows that the tac fresh water and wastewater flowrates increase as the number of cluster increases the tacs for cases 1 2 and 3 of scenario 2 are higher by 18 19 and 22 respectively as compared to that of the base case scenario 1 this is contributed mainly by the higher fresh water and wastewater flowrates in these water minimisation scenarios as these scenarios have reduced number of reuse recycle connections their reuse recycle flowrates are also reduced this leads to higher flowrates of fresh water and wastewater for these water networks hence there exists trade off between the network complexity and its water flowrates 5 water regeneration network when the potential for direct reuse recycle is exhausted water regeneration may be attempted the latter involves the use of material interception units e g filter adsorption etc for partial purification of water sources prior to their recovery to the sinks the earlier model with direct reuse recycle is readily extended into water regeneration network 5 1 superstructural model for material regeneration network eq 1 is revised to include the flow for material regeneration 24 s k j c l k f s r i s k j c l k c l k f s r i r e c l k f s r i w w f s r i s r i s r i where f s r i r e c l k is the flowrate of the water source i to the regeneration unit in cluster k eq 2 is revised to take into the consideration the regenerated water that is sent to water sink j f r e g s

interception unit the flowrate balances of the interception unit are given in eqs 27 and 28 for single pass e g sand filter ion exchange and partitioning units e g membrane dissolved air flotation respectively 27 s r i c l k f s r i r e c l k s k j c l k f r e g s k j c l k 28 s r i c l k f s r i r e c l k s k j c l k f r e g s k j c l k f r e g d where f r e g d is the discharge flowrate for partitioning interception unit the main assumption here is that flowrate loss is negligible for the interception unit s the additional flowrate variables for the interception unit f s r i r e c l k and f r e g s k j c l k will take non negative values 29 f s r i r e c l k f r e g s k j c l k 0 s k j s k j s r i s r i 5 2 placement of regeneration unit the regeneration unit is placed where the piping cost is at the minimal a set of coordinates n as listed in table 5 is used to consider n locations of potential placement of the regeneration unit in the plant to consider a set of n locations the equation is given by eq 30 30 s k j c l k f s r i s k j c l k r e n c l k f s r i r e n c l k f s r i w w f s r i s r i s r i a binary bn is assigned to the n locations to determine the location with the cheapest cost 31 f s r i r e n c l k m b n n n eq 32 is included to ensure only one location is chosen when a regeneration unit is included the model will generate a new cluster with an optimised placement of the regeneration unit 32 n b n 1 in order to determine the tac of the water regeneration network the operating cost in eq 7 is revised to include the regeneration unit with unit cost of c t r e as shown in eq 33 besides the capital cost in eq 6 should also consider the piping cost to and from the regeneration unit 33 o c s k j f f w s k j c t f w s r i f s r i w w c t w w s r i r e n c l k f s r i r e n c l k c t r e 6 literature example revisited the literature example is revisited to illustrate the water minimisation scenarios where interception unit is used for water regeneration reuse recycle schemes different types of interception unit are used i e single pass and partitioning units in scenario 3 the water regeneration network is synthesised without any cluster in scenarios 4 and 5 water regeneration networks with three clusters are synthesised the unit cost of regenerated source is taken as 0 8 t 18 while the parameters for piping cost to and from the regeneration unit remain identical as the direct reuse recycle case for scenarios 3 and 4 a single pass interception unit is to be used while scenario 5 has a partitioning interception unit with all units having fixed outlet concentration c r e o u t of 5 ppm it is also assumed that the regeneration unit is located at the centre of the plant scenario 3 or the individual clusters scenarios 4 and 5 formed in scenario 2 the coordinate locations of these units are shown in table 5 6 1 scenario 3 and 4 single pass interception unit scenario 3 investigated the case for a water regeneration network with a single pass interception unit note that this serves as base case for the water regeneration network the milp model is solved by minimising the tac in eq 8 subject to constraints in eqs 1 12 eqs 24 28 and eqs 30 33 resulted with an optimised network in fig 9 the performance of the network is summarised in table 6 in scenario 4 the same interception unit in scenario 3 is used i e c r e o u t 5 ppm the objective function is set to minimise the tac by solving the milp model subject to additional constraints in eqs 24 28 and eqs 30 33 the results of the optimisation model for scenario 4 are presented in table 6 with its water network shown in fig 10 as observed in table 6 both scenarios consume the lowest possible fresh water 10 t h but with higher regenerated water flowrate observed in scenario 4 this leads to higher operating cost and tac by 13 for scenario 4 it is also observed that the capital cost is much lower in scenario 4 as it is contributed by its reduced number of pipelines the latter also reflects the reduced network complexity similar to the earlier scenarios connections to from the fresh water feed and wastewater discharge the connections among water sources and sinks to from the regeneration unit are also excluded from the number of connections this is the fact that the fluctuations in these connections do not upset the water network directly 6 2 scenario 5 partitioning interception unit in this water minimisation scenario a partitioning interception unit is used the unit has two outlet streams i e product and reject streams flowrate of the later is discharged as wastewater due to its low quality the interception unit is characterised with an overall recovery factor rc given as in eq 33 34 r c f r e g f r e where f r e g is the flowrate of the purified stream and f r e is the flowrate of the inlet stream to the partitioning interception unit in this case rc value is assumed as 0 8 the same milp model as in scenario 4 is solved with revised flowrate constraints in eq 29 and rc constraint in eq 34 the resulted water regeneration network in shown in fig 11 with details given in table 6 as compared to the network in scenario 4 this network consumes higher flowrates of fresh water and regenerated water due to the flowrate loses 20 of the interception unit as characterised by eq 34 hence this leads to its higher operating cost and tac value 26 high that in scenario 3 and 12 higher than that in scenario 4 nevertheless its lower number of pipelines 11 connections helps to reduce its piping cost and leads to reduced network complexity 6 2 1 sensitivity of water regeneration cost on network performance in previous sections fixed water costs were used for water network synthesis however it has been observed that water tariff has increased gradually over the last decade across the globe 35 on the other hand the cost of water treatment regeneration varies depending on the type of technologies used fig 12 illustrates the effect of water regeneration cost on network performances for different number of clusters in scenario 5 as shown in fig 12 the tac cost of the water network increases with the increase of water regeneration cost it is also observed that the capital cost of the system increases due to the increase of number of connections besides the water network with higher number of clusters forms less complex cluster which is compensated by the higher tac it can also be concluded that the variation of water regeneration cost does not affect the overall trend of the results 7 conclusions this paper presented a generic model that includes water network structure consideration in a water minimisation study the approach reduces number of piping connections and total pipe length by forming different clusters in the network doing this reduces the complexity of the water network literature example was solved to demonstrate the approach for the direct reuse recycle case in scenario 2 the tac increased by 22 with the piping connections reduced to nine as compared to 17 in the base case scenario 1 the model is then extended to water regeneration network where single pass scenarios 3 and 4 and partitioning units scenario 5 are used for purification of water sources prior to their recovery the total annualised cost increases for water regeneration networks with three clusters i e 13 scenario 4 and 26 scenario 5 as compared to that without cluster scenario 3 nevertheless the reduced number of pipelines helps to reduce complexity of the water regeneration network future work may consider the elevation of water sinks and sources as some water using processes may not be located at the same level declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest 
13545,this paper presents a novel systematic decomposition method for the synthesis of water network the main objective of this approach is to reduce the complexity of the water network by dividing the system into several clusters with optimisation constraints these constraints include lengths of pipeline total pipe lengths of the clusters etc the method was applied to both direct reuse recycle and water regeneration networks a literature example is used to demonstrate the novel approach the generated network alternatives were compared for their minimum fresh water and wastewater flowrates piping costs as well as the number of pipelines it is observed that the number of pipelines and the piping costs decrease when the system is divided into more clusters i e simpler network the results also show that when the complexity of the network decreases higher fresh water is observed for the direct reuse recycle case and higher regenerated flowrate for the case of water regeneration network both cases lead to higher operating and total annualised cost of the water networks hence there is a trade off between network complexity and water flowrates it is up to the plant engineers or

six fold over the past century 1 the global water use continues to grow at a yearly rate of 1 due to the increase of population economic development and shifting in consumption patterns 1 however it is estimated that about 785 million people are still lacking the basic drinking water services 1 hence it is important to have better water management strategy to reduce the water scarcity issues in various parts of the world if not eliminated in this regard water recycling and reuse technologies have been identified as a mean to achieve the united nation sustainable development goal un sdg goal 6 by year 2030 2 one of the established group of tools for water recovery system design in the process industry is process integration which may be defined as a holistic approach to design operation which emphasises the unity of the process 3 4 the first trend of process integration was initiated in 1970s for the synthesis of heat exchanger network hen 5 6 it was later extended into heat integration for various energy intensive processes 7 8 in the late 1980s second trend of process integration was initiated by el halwagi and manousiouthakis 9 for the synthesis of mass exchange network and later into various mass integration initiative 4 following the analogy of heat and mass transfer a special case of mass integration i e water minimisation was then developed by wang and smith 10 based on the insight based pinch analysis technique while earlier developments were dedicated for fixed load problems 10 11 various other methods developed in the beginning of the 21st century were meant for the fixed flowrate problems which is believe to be more generic these include various graphical 12 13 and algebraic targeting methods 14 for direct water reuse recycle scheme as well as for water regeneration network 15 16 pinch analysis techniques for water minimisation became very well established in the 21st century and can be found in review paper 17 textbooks 4 8 18 and industrial guidebook 19 apart from pinch analysis technique various mathematical programming techniques have been established for water minimisation the mathematical optimisation techniques address several limitations associated with pinch analysis techniques these include the handling of multiple contaminants 20 21 cost optimisation 22 24 flexible network 25 26 simultaneous energy and water integration 27 28 as well as water network retrofit 29 from the above review it can be noticed that very little attempts have been made to focus on structure optimisation of the water network when water minimisation is implemented for process plants especially for processes with extensive water using processes it normally results in complex piping system this may lead to controllability issue due to the decrease in its degree of freedom a less complex network is always desired as it will reduce operational and controllability issues of the process plant one of the earliest attempts to address structural problems for industrial water network was reported by olesen and polley 30 based on the problem decomposition method for heat exchanger network 31 the authors first grouped the water using processes in different geographical zones where water flowrate targeting is performed using pinch analysis water recovery is then performed across zones to reduce overall water flowrates the main limitation for this earlier work is that the water using processes were grouped into their respective zones with ac hoc decision i e no systematic approach was employed this may result in sub optimal flowrate targets in another recent work dedicated for flexible water network a three stage optimisation approach was proposed based on the extended corner point method 26 in the latter the flexible water network was first synthesised to achieve the minimum fresh water flowrate the network is then subjected to stage two and three optimisation in order to reduce its number of pipelines and its total piping length doing this allows the synthesised network to tolerate changes in its operating parameters e g fluctuating flowrates and or concentration and yet with simple network structure however the method is only demonstrated for networks with a small numbers of water using processes the method can be cumbersome when huge networks e g with 10 water using processes are handled it is also worth noting that similar problems have been addressed in other areas of work e g hen synthesis one of the earliest attempts to address structural optimisation problems for hen was reported by amidpour and polley 31 the latter presented the decomposition approach where the overall problem is decomposed into sub problems in a flowsheet and heat transfer between specific zones is limited in a later work escobar et al 32 proposed a two stage approach for the synthesis of flexible and controllable hen a design stage is first performed where design variables are chosen the control variables are then adjusted in the second stage during operation for the realisations of uncertain parameters the technique yields a hen design that can operate under varying conditions while achieving energy integration objective ng et al 33 on the other hand decomposed an integrated hen by dividing its structure into several clusters to reduce its complexity a similar work by lam et al 34 reported a few model size reduction techniques for large scale biomass production and supply network which led to improvement in computational modelling time with little loss in accuracy in this work a superstructural model is developed for the synthesis of water network with reduced structure complexity the model considers piping length and number of piping connections in the water network water network synthesised with this model will have simpler structure as compared to those with other models which is the main novelty of this work the paper is structured as follows in the following section a problem statement is given the basic model for direct water reuse recycle is presented in the following section with a case study to elucidate the proposed model the model is next extended for water regeneration network where several types of water interception units are considered the case study is revisited to elucidate the extended model before conclusions are drawn for the paper 2 problem statement the superstructural representation for a direct reuse recycle network is given in fig 1 a with the following formal problem statement given a number of water consuming units in the process designated as process sink or skj j 1 2 3 n sk each sink requires a fixed requirement of water flowrate f s k j with a maximum concentration limit c s k j given a number of water generating units designated as process source or sri i 1 2 3 n sr each source has a fixed flowrate f s r i and a concentration c s r i each source can be sent for reuse recycle to the sinks the unutilised source s are sent for environmental discharge when the process source is insufficient for use by the sinks external fresh resource s with concentration c f w may be purchased to satisfy the requirement of sinks for a water regeneration network its superstructural representation is given in fig 1 b and the following is added to the problem statement given interception unit s of known performance the process source s is to be purified for use in the sinks the aim of this work is to propose a systematic decomposition strategy for an integrated water network to reduce its complexity a simpler network is desired to ease process operation 3 model formulation for direct reuse recycle in this section a superstructural model is proposed to synthesise a water network that consists of several independent sub networks or termed as cluster with the aim to segregate the process sources and sinks in the water network the model is mixed integer linear programming milp which is solved using gams v23 4 3 in this section the model is first presented for direct reuse recycle scheme 3 1 basic model formulation the basic model for a direct water reuse recycle network is modified from foo 18 to incorporate the new concept of clustering and has the following constraints each process water source i sri with flowrate f s r i may be allocated to the water sinks j skj in cluster clk in which its allocated flowrate is denoted as f s r i s k j c l k unutilised source would be directed as wastewater discharge with flowrate term f s r i w w eq 1 describes the overall flowrate balance for process source sri 1 s k j c l k f s r i s k j c l k f s r i w w f s r i s r i s r i each process water sink skj is fulfilled by process water sources f s r i s k j c l k or fresh water source with flowrate f f w s k j eq 2 describes the overall flowrate balance of the process sink skj 2 s r i c l k f s r i s k j c l k f f w s k j f s k j s k j s k j noted that no flow connection is to be built between the fresh water and wastewater discharge the total contaminant load from process source and fresh water should not exceed the maximum limit of each process sinks given by eq 3 3 s r i c l k f s r i s k j c l k c s r i f f w s k j c f w f s k j c s k j s k j s k j all variables of the superstructural model take a non negative value 4 f s r i s k j c l k f f w s k j f s r i w w 0 s k j s k j s r i s r i c l k c l k in order to incorporate piping and capital cost considerations a binary variable b s r i s k j c l k is introduced in the model to denote the presence and absence of water streams between sources sri and sinks skj in cluster clk the binary variable is activated using eq 5 5 f s r i s k j c l k m b s r i s k j c l k s k j s k j s r i s r i c l k c l k where m is an arbitrary large value the piping capital cost cc correlation includes a variation term a and a fixed term c as shown in eq 6 the coefficient a accounts for the linear impact of flowrate on the capital cost of piping whilst the fixed term c is a constant value that describes the basic capital cost contribution the capital cost is directly affected by the distance or length of the connections between the process water source and sink d s r i s k j c l k 6 c c s r i s k j c l k a f s r i s k j c l k c b s r i s k j c l k d s r i s k j c l k operating cost oc takes into consideration the costs of fresh water with unit cost ctfw and waste discharge with unit cost ctww 7 o c s k j f f w s k j c t f w s r i f s r i w w c t w w the total annual cost tac is then calculated by eq 8 8 t a c o c a o t c c a f where aot is the annual operating time the annualising factor af is calculated using eq 9 that follows 8 9 a f i r 1 i r y 1 i r y 1 where ir is interest rate and y is the number of years considered for the analysis 3 2 systematic decomposition with clustering approach this section describes how the clustering concept is used to synthesise a water network with the aim to reduce its complexity different constraints such as reduced individual piping length reduced total pipe length in the clusters and forbidden matches among sources and sinks in the clusters may be added the total number of pipelines in the entire network is given by eq 10 10 n p s r i s k j c l k b s r i s k j c l k where np is the number of pipelines in a reuse recycle network which may be related directly as the complexity of the water network note however that the constraints should exclude the pipe connections for sources and wastewater matches as well as those for fresh water and sink matches as these connections do not contribute to the complexity of the water network the overall distance between water sinks and sources may be calculated as the modular sum of difference in each axis given as in eq 11 11 d s r i s k j x s r i x s k j y s r i y s k j where x and y are coordinates of the sinks and sources the distances are assumed to be straight lines parallel to x axis and y axis note that eq 11 is also used to calculate the distance between fresh water and water sinks as well as the distance between water sources and wastewater discharge the total length of the connecting pipelines between source sri and sink skj in cluster clk is given as d s r i s k j c l k in eq 12 12 d s r i s k j c l k b s r i s k j c l k d s r i s k j s k j s k j s r i s r i c l k c l k in the following sub sections two strategies are outlined based on the clustering concept on individual and total pipe lengths 3 2 1 clustering based on individual pipe length between sources and sinks the upper bound and lower bound for the individual pipe length of the pipeline are given by 13 d s r i s k j c l k d u b 0 c l k c l k 14 d s r i s k j c l k d l b 0 c l k c l k here d ub andd lb are the upper and lower bounds for the individual pipe length between the source and sink respectively the lower bound in eq 14 takes zero value as there may not be any connection between a source and a sink the following procedure is proposed to determine the upper bound for piping length in eq 13 i the total number of clusters is first determined ii the axis x or y axis with the broadest range is selected the selected axis is divided by the number of clusters into sections of equal width iii the furthest mean distance of a cluster d m e a n m a x between the mid point of the divided sections is then calculated see illustration in fig 2 iv eq 15 shows how the upper bound value in eq 13 is determined from the average between the furthest mean distance d m e a n m a x step iii with that of the longest piping length for the base case scenario d b c m a x the latter is the water integration case where no cluster is used to segregate the sinks and sources i e or all sinks and sources co exist in the same cluster 15 d u b d m e a n m a x d b c m a x 2 to illustrate step iii a simple example is given in fig 2 in which three clusters is assumed for a plant where its layout is given as shown the y axis for the plant layout is larger than the x axis and hence the y axis is divided into three sections of equal width the furthest mean distance for this case is determined as 228 m 447 27 36 36 2 2 661 82 63 64 3 2 2 the furthest mean distances calculated for the two clusters and four clusters scenario are 254 and 219 m respectively whilst the longest piping length used in eq 15 which is obtained from the base case scenario is 683 m 3 2 2 clustering based on the total pipe lengths of the pipelines in a cluster for a given cluster clk the total piping length p l c l k of the cluster is given by eq 16 16 p l c l k s r i s k j d s r i s k j c l k c l k c l k the upper and lower bounds for the total piping length may be defined for cluster clk to avoid the possibility of all the sources and sinks being allocated into the same cluster 17 p l c l k p l u b 0 c l k c l k 18 p l c l k p l l b 0 c l k c l k here pl ub and pl lb are the upper and lower bounds for the total piping length in the cluster the lower bounds of the clusters p l l b is determined based on the shortest distance between the source and sink d s r i s k j c l k m i n from the base case i e when water integration is performed without cluster consideration 19 p l l b d s r i s k j c l k m i n eq 19 ensures that the cluster has at least a piping connection in the cluster the upper bound p l u b are predetermined from the total network pipe length of the base case scenario which is 3623 m it shall be noted that the constraints for the clusters do not include the piping connections among the sources and wastewater discharge as well as those among freshwater and sinks as these connections are not a detriment to the robustness of the network the equation is given by eq 20 20 p l u b d s r i s k j n d s r i s k j c l k m i n where n is the total number of clusters defined as the maximum number of clusters is pre determined by the designers the model may sometimes opt for less number of clusters if the upper bounds of the individual piping length and total piping are not exceeded this will be shown with the illustrative example additional constraint for the number of pipelines is also introduced to achieve system complexity reduction by introducing an upper bound npub given as in eq 21 21 n p n p u b 3 2 3 incorporation of forbidden matches the interconnections between clusters are forbidden using eq 22 this is to ensure that the clusters are independent from each other which leads to a more robust network 22 s r i s k j c l k b s r i s k j c l k 1 s k j s k j s r i s r i c l k c l k when a source and sink is connected to one cluster eq 22 ensures that the consequent match with the connected source and sink belong to the same cluster the objective function for the model may be set to minimise the total annual cost tac given as in eq 23 subject to the constraints in eqs 1 22 when different clusters are to be formed note that when cluster is not considered the model may be solved with constraints in eqs 1 9 this will be shown in the following example 23 m i n i m i s e t a c 4 illustrative example the newly proposed superstructural model is illustrated using a modified literature example taken from savelski and bagajewicz 23 with limiting water data given in table 1 in the latter fictitious coordinates for these water using processes are also added the upper bound in eq 15 is determined using coordinates in table 1 see fig 2 for illustration with these coordinates data the pipe length required for water reuse recycle connections can be estimated besides the structural of the water network can also be determined with the coordinates when no water minimisation is carried out the mass flowrates for freshwater and the wastewater are both determined as 354 36 t h summation of flowrates in column 4 in table 1 additional information used for cost calculations in these scenarios are extracted from foo 18 i the cost of freshwater ctfw and wastewater ctww are both taken as 1 t ii the af in eq 9 is calculated using an interest rate of 5 for a period of 5 years hence the af has a value of 0 231 iii the aot is assumed as 8000 h iv the piping parameters in eq 6 are given as 2 a and 250 c respectively v fresh water source is assumed to be located at coordinates 0 0 while wastewater discharge is located at coordinates 500 700 vi the x and y coordinates of the sources are located 2 units after the x and y coordinates of the sinks to account for self recycling piping the milp models of all scenarios are solved using gams v23 4 3 for the base case situation scenario 1 the model is solved without considering the network structure it is then compared to scenario 2 where network structures are considered 4 1 scenario 1 base case in this base case scenario the milp model is solved by minimising the total annualised cost tac of the network with the optimisation objective in eq 23 subjected to the constraints set by eqs 1 9 for this scenario the number of clusters is taken as one which means that all water sinks and sources are assumed to be located in the same cluster in other words no restriction is enforced to segregate the water using processes the solution of the milp model yields a tac of 3 4 m y with both fresh water and wastewater flowrates identified as 167 1 t h see table 2 for other details the network structure of this scenario is shown in fig 3 note that the minimum fresh water and wastewater flowrates for this scenario is equal to that reported by savelski and bagajewicz 23 when fresh water flowrate was minimised however the latter work did not consider network structure hence no comparison can be made on that aspect for the water network in fig 3 there are 17 direct reuse recycle connections fresh water and wastewater connects are ignored 4 2 scenario 2 optimisation with consideration of network structure scenario 2 considers the proposed model in this work three cases are analysed with two three and four clusters respectively the model is solved by minimising the tac in eq 8 subject to the constraints in eqs 1 22 the upper and lower bounds for individual pipe length and total pipe length in the clusters needed in eqs 17 and 18 are tabulated in tables 3 and 4 note that the lower bound of pipe length in table 3 is set as 0 since the connection between sink and source is not guaranteed note also that the number of piping connections formed within the cluster is dependent on the upper and lower bounds of the piping length imposed in tables 3 and 4 in solving case 1 with 2 clusters the upper bound for maximum connection in eq 21 has been excluded this results in a water network with 13 connections as shown in fig 4 next the upper bounds of piping connections eq 21 in cases 2 and 3 were set to 11 and 9 i e 2 connections lower than earlier cases the resulted network for these cases are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively from figs 3 6 it is easily observed that the complexity of the water network decreases as more clusters are allowed as the water sources and sinks are segregated from each other note also that for fig 4 even though 2 clusters have been set for the model the resulting network shows 3 clusters are formed in this case disturbance caused by a water using process within a cluster will not affect the process located in another cluster this leads to better robustness of the overall network a comparison of the optimisation results is shown in fig 7 as shown lower number of connections are observed when more clusters are allowed for the water network note that the number of connections only accounts for the direct reuse recycle pipelines among the water sources and sinks and excludes the connections among fresh water feed and sinks as well as those among sources and wastewater discharge this is due to the fact that these connections are independent in which their fluctuations do not upset the water network directly since the number of connections reduces in water networks with more clusters the reduction of total piping length of the network is also observed as shown in fig 8 besides fig 7 also shows that the tac fresh water and wastewater flowrates increase as the number of cluster increases the tacs for cases 1 2 and 3 of scenario 2 are higher by 18 19 and 22 respectively as compared to that of the base case scenario 1 this is contributed mainly by the higher fresh water and wastewater flowrates in these water minimisation scenarios as these scenarios have reduced number of reuse recycle connections their reuse recycle flowrates are also reduced this leads to higher flowrates of fresh water and wastewater for these water networks hence there exists trade off between the network complexity and its water flowrates 5 water regeneration network when the potential for direct reuse recycle is exhausted water regeneration may be attempted the latter involves the use of material interception units e g filter adsorption etc for partial purification of water sources prior to their recovery to the sinks the earlier model with direct reuse recycle is readily extended into water regeneration network 5 1 superstructural model for material regeneration network eq 1 is revised to include the flow for material regeneration 24 s k j c l k f s r i s k j c l k c l k f s r i r e c l k f s r i w w f s r i s r i s r i where f s r i r e c l k is the flowrate of the water source i to the regeneration unit in cluster k eq 2 is revised to take into the consideration the regenerated water that is sent to water sink j f r e g s

respectively 27 s r i c l k f s r i r e c l k s k j c l k f r e g s k j c l k 28 s r i c l k f s r i r e c l k s k j c l k f r e g s k j c l k f r e g d where f r e g d is the discharge flowrate for partitioning interception unit the main assumption here is that flowrate loss is negligible for the interception unit s the additional flowrate variables for the interception unit f s r i r e c l k and f r e g s k j c l k will take non negative values 29 f s r i r e c l k f r e g s k j c l k 0 s k j s k j s r i s r i 5 2 placement of regeneration unit the regeneration unit is placed where the piping cost is at the minimal a set of coordinates n as listed in table 5 is used to consider n locations of potential placement of the regeneration unit in the plant to consider a set of n locations

optimised placement of the regeneration unit 32 n b n 1 in order to determine the tac of the water regeneration network the operating cost in eq 7 is revised to include the regeneration unit with unit cost of c t r e as shown in eq 33 besides the capital cost in eq 6 should also consider the piping cost to and from the regeneration unit 33 o c s k j f f w s k j c t f w s r i f s r i w w c t w w s r i r e n c l k f s r i r e n c l k c t r e 6 literature example revisited the literature example is revisited to illustrate the water minimisation scenarios where interception unit is used for water regeneration reuse recycle schemes different types of interception unit are used i e single pass and partitioning units in scenario 3 the water regeneration network is synthesised without any cluster in scenarios 4 and 5 water regeneration networks with three clusters are synthesised the unit cost of regenerated source is taken as 0 8 t 18 while the parameters for piping cost to and from the regeneration unit remain identical as the direct reuse recycle case for scenarios 3 and 4 a single pass interception unit is to be used while scenario 5 has a partitioning interception unit with all units having fixed outlet concentration c r e o u t of 5 ppm it is also assumed that the regeneration unit is located at the centre of the plant scenario 3 or the individual clusters scenarios 4 and 5 formed in scenario 2 the coordinate locations of these units are shown in table 5 6 1 scenario 3 and 4 single pass interception unit scenario 3 investigated the case for a water regeneration network with a single pass interception unit note that this serves as base case for the water regeneration network the milp model is solved by minimising the tac in eq 8 subject to constraints in eqs 1 12 eqs 24 28 and eqs 30 33 resulted with an optimised network in fig 9 the performance of the network is summarised in table 6 in scenario 4 the same interception unit in scenario 3 is used i e c r e o u t 5 ppm the objective function is set to minimise the tac by solving the milp model subject to additional constraints in eqs 24 28 and eqs 30 33 the results of the optimisation model for scenario 4 are presented in table 6 with its water network shown in fig 10 as observed in table 6 both scenarios consume the lowest possible fresh water 10 t h but with higher regenerated water flowrate observed in scenario 4 this leads to higher operating cost and tac by 13 for scenario 4 it is also observed that the capital cost is much lower in scenario 4 as it is contributed by its reduced number of pipelines the latter also reflects the reduced network complexity similar to the earlier scenarios connections to from the fresh water feed and wastewater discharge the connections among water sources and sinks to from the regeneration unit are also excluded from the number of connections this is the fact that the fluctuations in these connections do not upset the water network directly 6 2 scenario 5 partitioning interception unit in this water minimisation scenario a partitioning interception unit is used the unit has two outlet streams i e product and reject streams flowrate of the later is discharged as wastewater due to its low quality the interception unit is characterised with an overall recovery factor rc given as in eq 33 34 r c f r e g f r e where f r e g is the flowrate of the purified stream and f r e is the flowrate of the inlet stream to the partitioning interception unit in this case rc value is assumed as 0 8 the same milp model as in scenario 4 is solved with revised flowrate constraints in eq 29 and rc constraint in eq 34 the resulted water regeneration network in shown in fig 11 with details given in table 6 as compared to the network in scenario 4 this network consumes higher flowrates of fresh water and regenerated water due to the flowrate loses 20 of the interception unit as characterised by eq 34 hence this leads to its higher operating cost and tac value 26 high that in scenario 3 and 12 higher than that in scenario 4 nevertheless its lower number of pipelines 11 connections helps to reduce its piping cost and leads to reduced network complexity 6 2 1 sensitivity of water regeneration cost on network performance in previous sections fixed water costs were used for water network synthesis however it has been observed that water tariff has increased gradually over the last decade across the globe 35 on the other hand the cost of water treatment regeneration varies depending on the type of technologies used fig 12 illustrates the effect of water regeneration cost on network performances for different number of clusters in scenario 5 as shown in fig 12 the tac cost of the water network increases with the increase of water regeneration cost it is also observed that the capital cost of the system increases due to the increase of number of connections besides the water network with higher number of clusters forms less complex cluster which is compensated by the higher tac it can also be concluded that the variation of water regeneration cost does not affect the overall trend of the results 7 conclusions this paper presented a generic model that includes water network structure consideration in a water minimisation study the approach reduces number of piping connections and total pipe length by forming different clusters in the network doing this reduces the complexity of the water network literature example was solved to demonstrate the approach for the direct reuse recycle case in scenario 2 the tac increased by 22 with the piping connections reduced to nine as compared to 17 in the base case scenario 1 the model is then extended to water regeneration network where single pass scenarios 3 and 4 and partitioning units scenario 5 are used for purification of water sources prior to their recovery the total annualised cost increases for water regeneration networks with three clusters i e 13 scenario 4 and 26 scenario 5 as compared to that without cluster scenario 3 nevertheless the reduced number of pipelines helps to reduce complexity of the water regeneration network future work may consider the elevation of water sinks and sources as some water using processes may not be located at the same level declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest

high efficiency coagulation has become an important technique in water treatment 1 2 this includes the treatment of domestic wastewater and industrial wastewater such as papermaking pharmaceutical cosmetics food mineral processing metal processing textile etc 3 in the south of china most domestic water is obtained by treating surface water the treatment efficiency of the coagulation unit depends to a large extent on the performance of the coagulant there have been three reported mechanisms during coagulation charge neutralization adsorption bridging and sweep 4 6 at present the most commonly used coagulants include conventional aluminum or iron salt polyaluminum chloride pac polyferric sulfate pfs and polyacrylamide pam however residual metal aluminum and harmful monomers released by pam are both thought to damage the human nervous system 7 ferric ions can lead to low ph of the drainage and corrosion of equipment 8 1 9 with changes in the aquatic environment and increasing market demand the need for efficient coagulant materials is increasing in the 1990s polysilicate composite coagulants were developed on the basis of metal salts such as al and fe and polysilicic acid used in water treatment 10 polysilicic acid psi is a cheap anionic inorganic coagulant that does not show great safety risks at present 11 through the combination of polysilicic acid

on pollutant particles simultaneously generated positive ions such as al oh 2 and al oh 2 can neutralize the electronegativity of colloids this allows aluminum containing coagulants to remove colloidal particles and other impurities from water by the charge neutralization effect of metal hydrolysis and the adsorption bridging action of al oh 3 s formed by hydrolysis polymerization the resulting coagulant formed in conjunction with an aluminum ion also effectively reduces the risk of metal residue in the effluent 18 20 non toxic ti and zr metals have shown promising coagulation

mononuclear hydroxide complexes occupy a major part higher concentration and lower acidity will cause hydrolysis of zirconium ions usually the mass fraction of zr monomers in the solution is below 20 24 tetramers and similar polynuclear materials are condensed through olation via oh bridge formation in polymerization this reaction accounts for the largest mass fraction of zr in solution 25 26 zirconium salts have been shown to have good potential as coagulants in water treatment 27 although zirconium coagulants have shown effectiveness and with no health risks identified during coagulation its use alone currently would lack economic feasibility 28 this study aimed to synthesize a new type of coagulant polyaluminum zirconium silicate pazs through which the polymerization reaction of

12 hrs polyaluminum silicate sulfate pass can be obtained without adding zr salt after curing the product was dried at 60 c for 12 hrs in a vacuum dryer which led to the formation of solid state pazs

for 30 min the upper 200 ml was drawn out as kaolin suspension to adjust the initial turbidity of synthetic water the humic acid 1 g l solution was prepared as follows 1 00 g ha was dissolved under

performed on a six paddle stirrer zr4 6 china in six 1 l square beakers initially 800 ml of synthetic water was transferred to each beaker with stirring speeds set to 200 rpm for 1 min and then 50 rpm for 15 min and finally allowed to rest for 20 min the coagulant was added at the beginning of the 200 rpm stirring interval one min later a syringe was used to withdraw a portion of the stirred mixture to determine the zeta potential omni america of the floc once settled a water sample 2 00 cm below the surface of the solution was collected for subsequent measurement a portion of the collected water sample was directly used for turbidity determination wgz 200 china while another portion was filtered through 0 45 um glass filter paper to measure the ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uv254 t6 xinshiji china the adopted jar test was based on a response surface method rsm to describe the correlation of experimental factors independent variables and observe the results responses three kinds of coagulants pazs pac and pass were tested with center composite design ccd to show different effects under different ph values x1 and coagulant dose x2 to determine the best coagulation state of the three with residual turbidity and uv254 removal response 13 sets of experiments were designed using design expert 8 0 6 software and three dimensional contour maps were drawn using second order polynomial equations 29 30 2 6 floc properties the fractal dimension method was used to describe the structure of flocs 9 in this experiment an image analysis method determined the two dimensional fractal dimension d2 of the flocs the settled floc was slowly moved to a petri dish with water a digital camera nikon d7000 with a 200 mm lens was used to take pictures making sure that the length of a pixel was less than or equal to 2 um then the feature length l and projected area a were calculated through image pro plus 6 0 software following eq 1 the fitting slope to obtain the d2 fractal dimension was calculated 20 31 1 a l d 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation condition optimization 3 1 1 effect of al zr ratio on treatment a single factor to control si zr al 1 and oh al zr 0 1 was used and the elemental concentration of silicon was fixed adjusting the ratio of al zr throughout the experiment with the continuous addition of all five coagulants the residual turbidity and uv254 of the synthetic water gradually decreased the effect tended to stabilize when the additional amount was greater than 8 mg l results showed that the composite coagulant pazs more effectively treated the water when the al zr ratio was 2 5 fig 1 a pazs has been shown to reduce the turbidity of kaolin humic acid synthetic water to less than 2 ntu and the uv254 removal efficiency was greater than 90 among them pazs with a ratio of al zr 3 had the best turbidity and uv254 removal ability when the coagulant dose is 10 mg l the residual turbidity was 0 26 ntu and uv254 removal efficiency was 93 7 this is due to the relatively low zirconium content hydrolysis and recombination of high valence state zirconium and its polynuclear polymers in water showed little effect aluminum salt and its silico aluminum polymer exert the main coagulation reaction conversely as zirconium content increases it may interfere with aluminum and water molecule hydration resulting in an increase in treated effluent turbidity 32 33 the optimized ratio al zr 3 was determined by taking economic benefits and coagulation efficiency into consideration this is consistent with the optimum ratio of zirconium aluminum salts studied by hussain et al 22 3 1 2 effect of si zr al ratio on treatment the concentration of si determines to some extent the bridging capacity of the coagulant under conditions of al zr 3 and oh al zr 0 1 the influence of si zr al on the coagulation effect was investigated related research of polysilicic acid indicates that silicic acid ions will protonate as ph decreases 11 through si o bonds polymerization continues to form dimers trimers multimers and so forth the addition of metal is combined with silicic acid in the form of si m and si o m m is al or zr polysilicic acid polymerizes with metal to form complexes with a three dimensional network structure therefore sweep flocculation improves the capacity of the flocculant this ratio also enables greater potential for metal polysilicic acid coagulants in water treatment applications 34 from fig 1 b it can be concluded that pazs is most effective as a coagulant when si zr al 1 this is due to zr and al ions forming a polysilicate metal mixture with polysilicic acid strengthening the roles of adsorption and bridging effects as a result flocs are continuously connected and absorbed to become larger to settle and finally be removed in contrast when si zr al 1 both uv254 and turbidity removal become less efficient considering the instability of silicic acid si zr al 1 is the most suitable choice 3 1 3 effect of oh al zr ratio on treatment the oh content of the coagulant i e oh al zr affects the existing form of metal ions in the mixture 18 assuming optimized conditions of si zr al 1 and al zr 3 and a fixed elemental concentration of silicon oh al zr was adjusted to attempt to maximize coagulation efficiency fig 1 c shows that the pazs coagulant has the greatest effect on water turbidity and organic matter removal when oh al zr 0 15 in general the additional amount of oh has an influence on the treatment effects of pazs but this is not significant as the oh al zr ratio increases the turbidity and uv254 removal efficiencies increase at first and then decrease this is due to the added oh reacting with al mononuclear molecules to form medium polymers for example al13 35 has very strong adsorption charge neutralization and precipitation effect but with the continuous increase of oh al zr al will continue to polymerize to larger molecules resulting in the reduced effectiveness of a113 unfortunately any increase in oh inevitably leads to an increase of the coagulant ph thus al ⅲ and zr ⅳ are easily hydrolyzed and precipitated which is not conducive to stable storage of coagulants therefore a ratio of 0 15 was selected as the optimized preparation condition 3 2 structure and morphological analysis the optimized ratio of pazs coagulant was characterized by ftir xrd and sem the infrared spectra of pass and pazs are shown in fig 2 a both have two strong and wide absorption peaks at 3500 3300 and 1646 cm 1 representing the stretching vibration of oh and bending vibration caused by absorption polymerization and crystal water in the coagulant respectively the wide wave peaks of pass and pazs indicate that oh exists in a variety of chemical environments 36 the energy band at 1085 cm 1 belongs to the siloxane si o si unit at the tetrahedral and octahedral interface the absorption peak at 1146 cm 1 is the asymmetric stretching vibration of al o al 37 in addition an absorption peak also appeared at 604 cm 1 which was related to the bending vibration and tensile vibration of al o si notably the absorption peak of pazs at 940 950 cm 1 is the vibration of zr o si and the research by machugh indicates that the addition of zirconium will generate highly condensed species in solution 17 38 it means that zr and al can partially replace si and form highly condensed silicates these above results show that new polysilicate mixtures can be formed between zr al and si rather than simple physical mixing fig 2 b shows the xrd patterns of these coagulants crystalline materials will produce diffraction peaks at a certain angle while amorphous material does not produce the diffraction peak but diffraction peak packets 39 40 based on xrd analysis of jade 6 the crystal form of zr so4 2 was not observed in pazs indicating that other structures may be transformed during the synthesis reaction it was also observed that naal so4 2 h2o 6 naalsio4 na8al6si6o24so4 and zrsio24o50 diffraction structures appear in pazs material implying that zr so4 2 can form a complex silicic acid crystal structure using silicon therefore it can be inferred that aluminum sulfate polysilicon acid and zirconium sulfate undergo a complex chemical reaction and form a new distinct inorganic polymer complex as depicted in fig 3 both pazs and pass have an amorphous structure with a radius of a micron compared with pass the surface morphology of pazs shows folded areas appearing on the surface while pass surfaces are relatively smooth this is similar to the furrowed flower like surfaces observed by deng et al 28 the specific image is shown in fig 3 c these folds are uniformly distributed on the particle surfaces with nanoscale elongated protrusions fig 3 a shows that the pazs clusters are denser and more porous it is possible that the addition of zirconium reacts continuously in the long chain of silicate to form tiny structures on the surface resulting in a more prominent three dimensional polymeric network structure this means pazs has a higher surface area than pass 14 39 this may enhance the adsorption and precipitation of pollutants in water providing the pazs coagulant with improved coagulation effects the distribution of pazs elements was determined by eds with specific atomic percentage shown in fig 3 e the corresponding element ratio obtained is consistent with the optimal condition obtained in step 3 2 3 3 effect of ph and coagulant dose on treatment results from jar tests showed that ph and coagulant dose have a significant influence on the effect of each coagulant fig 4 displays the response surface of the treated water from the coagulation process comparing the three proposed coagulants the removal of turbidity and uv254 by pazs performed best in the ph range of 3 8 the residual turbidity was less than 1 50 ntu and the uv254 removal efficiency was greater than 85 however the coagulation efficiency of pac and pass greatly decreased under more acidic conditions for pass the coagulation effect decreased rapidly when the ph value was less than 4 with ideal ph conditions between 6 and 8 the coagulation effect was continually enhanced with increasing coagulant dose this implies that zr polymeric cationic species are prominent at low ph 32 41 jarvis and other researchers 26 42 found that zirconium has positive charge properties due to its differing polymerization forms in differing ph ranges such as zr4 oh 8 oh2 16 8 and zr oh oh2 7 3 the resulting percentage removals of uv254 at ph 4 were 93 8 for pazs 74 7 for pass and 81 3 for pac respectively experimental results indicate pazs has a promising removal effect on macromolecular humus organic compounds represented by uv254 at a wide range of ph levels the comparative results of the uv254 removal ability of the three coagulants at ph 4 6 and 8 are as follows pazs pac pass ph 4 pazs pass pac ph 6 pazs pass pac ph 8 when evaluating the second order polynomial equation of ccd through analysis of variance anova in design expert 8 0 6 the coefficient of determination r2 of the quadratic models of pazs pass and pac are 0 959 0 974 and 0 982 respectively both the adjusted values of r2 and r2 are close to 1 which indicate that the quadratic regression model is consistent with actual results in the equations x1 represents ph and x2 represents the coagulant dose final model equations of uv254 removal percentage are as follows for pazs y uv254 removal 83 68 0 44 x1 2 03 x2 0 16 x1 x2 0 003 x1 2 0 15 x2 2 for pass y uv254 removal 62 81 35 52 x1 5 97 x2 0 48 x1 x2 2 07 x1 2 0 14 x2 2 for pac y uv254 removal 46 86 12 74 x1 1 68 x2 0 39 x1 x2 1 01 x1 2 0 04 x2 2 3 4 zeta potential analysis for continued study of pazs mechanisms at different ph coagulation reactions zeta potential analysis was performed fig 5 a demonstrates that a decrease in ph and an increase in dosage will cause an increase in zeta potential a decrease in ph causes the h in the water to neutralize the negative charges of some impurities as the dosage increases the coagulant continues to neutralize and particles continue to settle gradually increasing zeta potential results indicate that at ph 3 5 the zeta potential of pazs is between 5 and 5 mv this zeta range effectively removes organic matter in water the aqueous solution remains in an unstable state and the various impure colloids tend to aggregate and precipitate under this ph condition when the coagulant dose is less than 4 mg l the zeta potential increases rapidly zr and al metal ions are hydrolyzed to form a variety of polymerized positive ions and the adsorption charge neutralization effect plays a major role with an increase in the addition of polysilicic acid the effect is also enhanced and the adsorption bridging and sweep functions cooperate to achieve more effective treatment these findings indicate a good coagulation effect despite acidic conditions according to ccd results at ph 7 8 43 coagulant doses equal to 10 mg l result in the best coagulation effect in this case this is consistent with the zeta potential 0 mv fig 5 b shows the zeta potential broken line diagram when the coagulant dose is 10 mg l it can be seen that at ph 6 the potential of pazs is higher than that of pass this is due to differing high charge hydrolysis states of zr enhancing the neutralization ability of pazs under this ph condition and a stronger ability to neutralize impurities furthermore the treated water quality by pac was not as good as pass and pazs but the pac zeta potential was higher this indicates that pazs has a synergistic effect except for charge neutralization any other adsorption bridging can work together to synergize water treatment 3 5 floc properties d2 fractal dimensions reflect the internal process of coagulation for coagulation mechanisms to be understood further the coagulation form of pazs at different ph levels were observed by filming with a high definition digital camera fig 6 was calculated and drawn according to formula 1 and it is apparent that i d2 initially increases and then decreases as dosage increases which is attributed to the stabilization mechanism 44 and ii d2 has a comparatively larger value at low ph on the one hand humic acid molecules are best removed under acidic conditions while on the other hand zr and polysilicic acid coagulants can tolerate much lower ph changes and remain functionality they interconnect the flocs during the flocculation process to produce denser flocs as the zp analysis has shown 45 46 charge neutralization combined with adsorption bridging in acidic solution efficient sweep trapping effects causes the mixed solution to enter a fast and unstable state where impurities quickly settle in the water iii it can also be observed from the floc images that the combined form and size of the flocs are not uniform at ph 8 the flocs are relatively fragile at ph 4 and 6 the flocs are stronger and the cluster is more compact the corresponding mechanism is shown in fig 7 d 3 6 flocculant effect comparison flocculation performance of the pazs was analyzed while treating a real surface water sample acquired from the pearl river in guangzhou china the initial ph temperature turbidity and uv254 were 7 32 23 c 25 8 ntu and 0 211 cm 1 respectively coagulation experiments showed that the effect of pazs is measurably better than that of any commercial pac uv254 removal by pazs from the river water was 7 higher than that of pac and settled turbidity was reduced to 0 46 ntu while the remaining turbidity after pac treatment was 1 42 ntu lastly the coagulation efficiency in the test water with ph 3 was 22 7 higher than that of pac table 1 compares pazs with other polysilicic acid coagulants the results indicate that pazs exhibits superior performance in coagulation treatment compared with other tested coagulants 4 conclusion to improve water treatment efficiency a novel inorganic composite coagulant polyaluminum zirconium silicate sulfate pazs was synthesized using sodium silicate and aluminum zirconium salts as raw materials under the conditions of si zr al 1 oh al zr 0 1 al zr 3 pazs has displayed efficient coagulation performance the proposed composite coagulant pazs was characterized and analyzed by ftir xrd and sem results showed that zr and al can successfully interact with polysilicic acid through non physical mixing and form a structure with naal so4 2 h2o 6 naalsio4 na8al6si6o24so4 and zrsio24o50 in water treatment through comparative analysis with pass and pac pazs can more effectively remove turbidity and uv254 over a wide ph range of 3 8 the specific residual turbidity result was less than 1 50 ntu and uv254 removal efficiency was greater than 85 due to the silica aluminum zirconium complex making the coagulant with a larger surface area the electrostatic adsorption of particles was greatly enhanced in floc analysis the fractal dimension of the composite coagulant was larger in acidic conditions the adsorption and bridging effects and positive charge characteristics make it adaptable in an acidic environment zeta potential and coagulation experiments showed that pazs has a stronger synergistic effect than pac and pass in summary the pazs composite flocculant prepared by a simple co polymerization method was used for the treatment of kaolin ha synthetic water and actual wastewater the combined results of these experiments and observations demonstrate that pazs is a promising coagulant for efficient water treatment declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest

conditions of al zr 3 and oh al zr 0 1 the influence of si zr al on the coagulation effect was investigated related research of polysilicic acid indicates that silicic acid ions will protonate as ph decreases 11 through si o bonds polymerization continues to form dimers trimers multimers and so forth the addition of metal is combined with silicic acid in the form of si m and si o m m is al or zr polysilicic acid polymerizes with metal to form complexes with a three dimensional network structure therefore sweep flocculation improves the capacity of the flocculant this ratio also enables greater potential for metal polysilicic acid coagulants in water treatment applications 34 from fig 1 b it can be concluded that pazs is most effective as a coagulant when si zr al 1 this is due to zr and al ions forming a polysilicate metal mixture with polysilicic acid strengthening the roles of adsorption and bridging effects as a result flocs are continuously connected and absorbed to become larger to settle and finally be removed in contrast when si zr al 1 both uv254 and turbidity removal become less efficient considering the instability of silicic acid si zr al 1 is the most suitable choice 3 1 3 effect of oh al zr ratio on treatment the oh content of the coagulant i e oh al zr affects the existing form of metal ions in the mixture 18 assuming optimized conditions of si zr al 1 and al zr 3 and a fixed elemental concentration of silicon oh al zr was adjusted to attempt to maximize coagulation efficiency fig 1 c shows that the pazs coagulant has the greatest effect on water turbidity and organic matter removal when oh al zr 0 15 in general the additional amount of oh has an influence on the treatment effects of pazs but this is not significant as the oh al zr ratio increases the turbidity and uv254 removal efficiencies increase at first and then decrease this is due to the added oh reacting with al mononuclear molecules to form medium polymers for example al13 35 has very strong adsorption charge neutralization and precipitation effect but with the continuous increase of oh al zr al will continue to polymerize to larger molecules resulting in the reduced effectiveness of a113 unfortunately any increase in oh inevitably leads to an increase of the coagulant ph thus al ⅲ and zr ⅳ are easily hydrolyzed and precipitated which is not conducive to stable storage of coagulants therefore a ratio of 0 15 was selected as the optimized preparation condition 3 2 structure and morphological analysis the optimized ratio of pazs coagulant was characterized by ftir xrd and sem the infrared spectra of pass and pazs are shown in fig 2 a both have two strong and wide absorption peaks at 3500 3300 and 1646 cm 1 representing the stretching vibration of oh and bending vibration caused by absorption polymerization and crystal water in the coagulant respectively the wide wave peaks of pass and pazs indicate that oh exists in a variety of chemical environments 36 the energy band at 1085 cm 1 belongs to the siloxane si o si unit at the tetrahedral and octahedral interface the absorption peak at 1146 cm 1 is the asymmetric stretching vibration of al o al 37 in addition an absorption peak also appeared at 604 cm 1 which was related to the bending vibration and tensile vibration of al o si notably the absorption peak of pazs at 940 950 cm 1 is the vibration of zr o si and the research by machugh indicates that the addition of zirconium will generate highly condensed species in solution 17 38 it means that zr and al can partially replace si and form highly condensed silicates these above results show that new polysilicate mixtures can be formed between zr al and si rather than simple physical mixing fig 2 b shows the xrd patterns of these coagulants crystalline materials will produce diffraction peaks at a certain angle while amorphous material does not produce the diffraction peak but diffraction peak packets 39 40 based on xrd analysis of jade 6 the crystal form of zr so4 2 was not observed in pazs indicating that other structures may be transformed during the synthesis reaction it was also observed that naal so4 2 h2o 6 naalsio4 na8al6si6o24so4 and zrsio24o50 diffraction structures appear in pazs material implying that zr so4 2 can form a complex silicic acid crystal structure using silicon therefore it can be inferred that aluminum sulfate polysilicon acid and zirconium sulfate undergo a complex chemical reaction and form a new distinct inorganic polymer complex as depicted in fig 3 both pazs and pass have an amorphous structure with a radius of a micron compared with pass the surface morphology of pazs shows folded areas appearing on the surface while pass surfaces are relatively smooth this is similar to the furrowed flower like surfaces observed by deng et al 28 the specific image is shown in fig 3 c these folds are uniformly distributed on the particle surfaces with nanoscale elongated protrusions fig 3 a shows that the pazs clusters are denser and more porous it is possible that the addition of zirconium reacts continuously in the long chain of silicate to form tiny structures on the surface resulting in a more prominent three dimensional polymeric network structure this means pazs has a higher surface area than pass 14 39 this may enhance the adsorption and precipitation of pollutants in water providing the pazs coagulant with improved coagulation effects the distribution of pazs elements was determined by eds with specific atomic percentage shown in fig 3 e the corresponding element ratio obtained is consistent with the optimal condition obtained in step 3 2 3 3 effect of ph and coagulant dose on treatment results from jar tests showed that ph and coagulant dose have a significant influence on the effect of each coagulant fig 4 displays the response surface of the treated water from the coagulation process comparing the three proposed coagulants the removal of turbidity and uv254 by pazs performed best in the ph range of 3 8 the residual turbidity was less than 1 50 ntu and the uv254 removal efficiency was greater than 85 however the coagulation efficiency of pac and pass greatly decreased under more acidic conditions for pass the coagulation effect decreased rapidly when the ph value was less than 4 with ideal ph conditions between 6 and 8 the coagulation effect was continually enhanced with increasing coagulant dose this implies that zr polymeric cationic species are prominent at low ph 32 41 jarvis and other researchers 26 42 found that zirconium has positive charge properties due to its differing polymerization forms in differing ph ranges such as zr4 oh 8 oh2 16 8 and zr oh oh2 7 3 the resulting percentage removals of uv254 at ph 4 were 93 8 for pazs 74 7 for pass and 81 3 for pac respectively experimental results indicate pazs has a promising removal effect on macromolecular humus organic compounds represented by uv254 at a wide range of ph levels the comparative results of the uv254 removal ability of the three coagulants at ph 4 6 and 8 are as follows pazs pac pass ph 4 pazs pass pac ph 6 pazs pass pac ph 8 when evaluating the second order polynomial equation of ccd through analysis of variance anova in design expert 8 0 6 the coefficient of determination r2 of the quadratic models of pazs pass and pac are 0 959 0 974 and 0 982 respectively both the adjusted values of r2 and r2 are close to 1 which indicate that the quadratic regression model is consistent with actual results in the equations x1 represents ph and x2 represents the coagulant dose final model equations of uv254 removal percentage are as follows for pazs y uv254 removal 83 68 0 44 x1 2 03 x2 0 16 x1 x2 0 003 x1 2 0 15 x2 2 for pass y uv254 removal 62 81 35 52 x1 5 97 x2 0 48 x1 x2 2 07 x1 2 0 14 x2 2 for pac y uv254 removal 46 86 12 74 x1 1 68 x2 0 39 x1 x2 1 01 x1 2 0 04 x2 2 3 4 zeta potential analysis for continued study of pazs mechanisms at different ph coagulation reactions zeta potential analysis was performed fig 5 a demonstrates that a decrease in ph and an increase in dosage will cause an increase in zeta potential a decrease in ph causes the h in the water to neutralize the negative charges of some impurities as the dosage increases the coagulant continues to neutralize and particles continue to settle gradually increasing zeta potential results indicate that at ph 3 5 the zeta potential of pazs is between 5 and 5 mv this zeta range effectively removes organic matter in water the aqueous solution remains in an unstable state and the various impure colloids tend to aggregate and precipitate under this ph condition when the coagulant dose is less than 4 mg l the zeta potential increases rapidly zr and al metal ions are hydrolyzed to form a variety of polymerized positive ions and the adsorption charge neutralization effect plays a major role with an increase in the addition of polysilicic acid the effect is also enhanced and the adsorption bridging and sweep functions cooperate to achieve more effective treatment these findings indicate a good coagulation effect despite acidic conditions according to ccd results at ph 7 8 43 coagulant doses equal to 10 mg l result in the best coagulation effect in this case this is consistent with the zeta potential 0 mv fig 5 b shows the zeta potential broken line diagram when the coagulant dose is 10 mg l it can be seen that at ph 6 the potential of pazs is higher than that of pass this is due to differing high charge hydrolysis states of zr enhancing the neutralization ability of pazs under this ph condition and a stronger ability to neutralize impurities furthermore the treated water quality by pac was not as good as pass and pazs but the pac zeta potential was higher this indicates that pazs has a synergistic effect except for charge neutralization any other adsorption bridging can work together to synergize water treatment 3 5 floc properties d2 fractal dimensions reflect the internal process of coagulation for coagulation mechanisms to be understood further the coagulation form of pazs at different ph levels were observed by filming with a high definition digital camera fig 6 was calculated and drawn according to formula 1 and it is apparent that i d2 initially increases and then decreases as dosage increases which is attributed to the stabilization mechanism 44 and ii d2 has a comparatively larger value at low ph on the one hand humic acid molecules are best removed under acidic conditions while on the other hand zr and polysilicic acid coagulants can tolerate much lower ph changes and remain functionality they interconnect the flocs during the flocculation process to produce denser flocs as the zp analysis has shown 45 46 charge neutralization combined with adsorption bridging in acidic solution efficient sweep trapping effects causes the mixed solution to enter a fast and unstable state where impurities quickly settle in the water iii it can also be observed from the floc images that the combined form and size of the flocs are not uniform at ph 8 the flocs are relatively fragile at ph 4 and 6 the flocs are stronger and the cluster is more compact the corresponding mechanism is shown in fig 7 d 3 6 flocculant effect comparison flocculation performance of the pazs was analyzed while treating a real surface water sample acquired from the pearl river in guangzhou china the initial ph temperature turbidity and uv254 were 7 32 23 c 25 8 ntu and 0 211 cm 1 respectively coagulation experiments showed that the effect of pazs is measurably better than that of any commercial pac uv254 removal by pazs from the river water was 7 higher than that of pac and settled turbidity was reduced to 0 46 ntu while the remaining turbidity after pac treatment was 1 42 ntu lastly the coagulation efficiency in the test water with ph 3 was 22 7 higher than that of pac table 1 compares pazs with other polysilicic acid coagulants the results indicate that pazs exhibits superior performance in coagulation treatment compared with other tested coagulants 4 conclusion to improve water treatment efficiency a novel inorganic composite coagulant polyaluminum zirconium silicate sulfate pazs was synthesized using sodium silicate and aluminum zirconium salts as raw materials under the conditions of si zr al 1 oh al zr 0 1 al zr 3 pazs has displayed efficient coagulation performance the proposed composite coagulant pazs was characterized and analyzed by ftir xrd and sem results showed that zr and al can successfully interact with polysilicic acid through non physical mixing and form a structure with naal so4 2 h2o 6 naalsio4 na8al6si6o24so4 and zrsio24o50 in water treatment through comparative analysis with pass and pac pazs can more effectively remove turbidity and uv254 over a wide ph range of 3 8 the specific residual turbidity result was less than 1 50 ntu and uv254 removal efficiency was greater than 85 due to the silica aluminum zirconium complex making the coagulant with a larger surface area the electrostatic adsorption of particles was greatly enhanced in floc analysis the fractal dimension of the composite coagulant was larger in acidic conditions the adsorption and bridging effects and positive charge characteristics make it adaptable in an acidic environment zeta potential and coagulation experiments showed that pazs has a stronger synergistic effect than pac and pass in summary the pazs composite flocculant prepared by a simple co polymerization method was used for the treatment of kaolin ha synthetic water and actual wastewater the combined results of these experiments and observations demonstrate that pazs is a promising coagulant for efficient water treatment declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest

pollutants that have negative effects on aquatic and human life 1 there are many ways for dye removal from aqueous solutions such as wet oxidation adsorption and biological treatment but these methods have some drawbacks such as low efficiency and high cost 2 4 electro fenton is one of the most advanced and cost effective oxidation processes for the removal of toxic organic compounds the process based on the in situ generation of hydroxyl radicals o h which are produced by the reaction of fenton reagent that consists of h2o2 and fe2 in acidic media 5 7 hydroxyl radicals are powerful oxidizing agents e 2 8 v vs nhe normal hydrogen electrode that react quickly and non selectively with nearly all electron rich organic compounds to produce co2 h2o and some intermediates 8 10 in the electro

fenton technology has been developed to eliminate a variety of contaminants and it has been discovered that cathode material and its structure play a major role in the success of this technology the cathode has a significant effect on the continuous production of h2o2 and hence on the reactive hydroxyl radicals carbonaceous cathode materials are acknowledged as more environmentally friendly economical and effective due to their high overpotential concerning water discharge 11 there are various types of carbonaceous cathodes reported in the literature such as graphite 12 carbon fiber brush 13 carbon sponge 14 reticulated vitreous carbon 15 carbon polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe 16 carbon nanotubes 17 carbon or graphite felt 18 and activated carbon fiber 19 20 despite these electrodes provided a high surface area per unit volume which is an important criterion in electrolytic cells but it suffers from a crucial disadvantage which lies in entrapping gas bubbles which tend to increase the cell resistance and blanket part of the cathode area 21 before o2 reduction at the graphite surface two mass transfer steps should take place namely mass transfer of o2 gas from o2 bubbles to the solution followed by mass transfer of the dissolved oxygen from the solution to the graphite surface 22 to achieve a high output rate of h2o2 and a high dye removal rate it is therefore necessary that oxygen transfer is increased to the cathode surface to this end the present work aims to study the performance of a new o2 sparged fixed bed electrochemical reactor in removing reactive red 195 dye from wastewater by the electro fenton technique the cell contains a fixed bed graphite cathode overlaid with a sacrificial steel screen stack anode made of low carbon steel 0 15 carbon variables studied were current density initial dye concentration oxygen sparging rate and number of graphite cathode layers fixed bed electrode has the advantage of high area per unit volume and a high space time yield beside the high rate of mass transfer 23 h2o2 will be electro generated at the graphite cathode by reduction of the continuously sparged oxygen while fe2 will be generated from a sacrificial steel anode placed downstream of the fixed bed cathode without adding any external chemicals the h2o2 level plays an important role in electro fenton reaction efficiency as it directly affects the theoretical peak of produced o h the efficiency of the process can be improved by increasing the electrically produced h2o2 but its overproduction or accumulation can result in counter productive effect due to the occurrence of reactions such ferrous ions regeneration by reduction of ferric ions with h2o2 eq 7 which may negatively affect the overall efficiency of the process 7 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h o 2 ᵒ h in addition unused portions of h2o2 may consume chemical oxidants during cod analyses resulting in an overestimation of cod values 24 there are alternative ways to continuously regenerate ferrous ions and enhance the efficiency of the process such as reduction of ferric ions at the cathode eq 8 or by reduction with hydroperoxyl radical ho2 eq 9 or by reduction with organic radical intermediates eq 10 25 27 8 f e 3 e f e 2 9 f e 3 h o 2 ᵒ f e 2 o 2 h 10 f e 3 r ᵒ f e 2 r 2 experimental part 2 1 materials reactive red 195 powder used in this study was supplied by the turkish tetco company the required experimental solutions with desired concentrations were prepared by dilution with distilled water the initial ph of the solution was adjusted at a value of 3 by using hcl and naoh solutions the supporting electrolyte of the cell is nacl because of the ability of c l to destroy passive films that might form on the anode especially at high current densities the dye structure is displayed in fig 1 2 2 experimental setup fig 2 describes the batch reactor where the electro fenton process was accomplished it consisted of a cylindrical plexiglass column of 24 cm height and 9 4 cm diameter a sintered glass was connected to the reactor bottom to achieve uniform oxygen flow distribution from an oxygen cylinder the cathode chamber was a porous stainless steel basket of 9 3 cm diameter randomly packed with layers of graphite each layer of graphite consisted of 69 small graphite cylinders of aspect ratio h d 1 each cylinder had a diameter of 7 mm the area of one graphite layer was calculated from the following equation 11 a r e a o f o n e g r a p h i t e l a y e r 69 2 π 4 d 2 π d h where d and h are the diameter and height of the graphite cylinder respectively so the total surface area of one layer of graphite is 159 39 cm2 the cathode chamber was placed at the bottom of the reactor the sacrificial anode consisted of five horizontal stacked steel screens of 9 3 cm in diameter made of low carbon steel 0 15 carbon the screen anode opening was 7 mm the distance between the cathode and anode was 3 cm the electrical circuit consisted of a direct current power supply 15 v with a voltage controller and a multi range ammeter connected in series with the cell a voltmeter was connected in parallel with the cell to measure its voltage to give an idea about the amount of iron dissolved from the sacrificial steel anode faraday s law was applied using a cell containing one layer cathode area 159 4 cm2 the amount of iron dissolved ranged from 0 167 to 1 336 g h for the current density range 1 8 ma cm2 respectively 2 3 experimental procedure 1 5 l of the prepared dye solution was introduced into the cell at the start of each run before each run the electrodes were pickled in dilute hcl to remove scales cleaned with distilled water followed by drying samples were taken every ten minutes during electrolysis for analysis by a spectrophotometer at the maximum wavelength of the dye which is 530 nm while cod removal was measured using the astm d1252 method each run lasted for 60 min the color removal efficiency was calculated using the equation 12 r e m o v a l c o c f c o 100 reproducibility of the results ranged from 3 to 5 the sacrificial screen anode was replaced by a new one from time to time 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of superficial o2 velocity figs 3 and 4 show the effect of superficial o2 velocity on the removal of dye the data show that dye removal increases with increasing superficial o2 velocity at different contact times and different current densities this result is attributed to the increase in the rate of mass transfer of o2 from bubbles to the solution and the increase in the rate of the diffusion controlled generation of h2o2 where diffusion plays an important role in the rate of h2o2 cathodic formation 28 29 the rate of h2o2 formation from dissolved o2 is given by the following equation 28 29 13 r h 2 o 2 i z f a d δ c c i increasing the superficial o2 not only maintains the bulk dissolved o2 concentration at the saturation value with a consequent increase in the driving force for the reaction but also decreases the diffusion layer thickness δ surrounding each carbon cylinder i e increases the mass transfer coefficient k of o2 reduction to h2o2 the increase in the bulk o2 concentration and the mass transfer coefficient increases the current i consumed in generating h2o2 with a consequent increase in the rate of h2o2 generation r h 2 o 2 according to faraday s law the decrease of diffusion layer δ by increasing superficial o2 velocity is ascribed to the turbulence s promoting ability of o2 bubbles and their ability to induce radial momentum as well as axial momentum 30 31 from fig 4 it is noteworthy that at higher current density a superficial o2 velocity of 0 04 cm s gave a maximum dye removal any increase in o2 velocity does not increase dye removal any further probably because the h2o2 generation reaction becomes a chemically controlled reaction which is not sensitive to stirring 3 2 effect of current density figs 5 and 6 show the effect of cathodic current density on the dye removal under different operating conditions the data show that in all cases the dye removal increases with increasing current density until it reaches a maximum value at 6 ma cm2 and then it almost remains constant with further increase in current density the increase in dye removal rate with current density is expected based on faraday s law m eit 32 according to which the amount of h2o2 generated by cathodic reduction of dissolved o2 and the amount of fe2 generated by anodic dissolution increases with increasing current density the increase in h2o2 and fe2 concentration is followed by an increase in the oxidizing free radical o h concentration according to eq 3 which oxidizes the dye molecules the fact that current densities higher than 6 ma cm2 don t improve the dye removal may be ascribed to side reactions taking place at the cathode along with h2o2 generation such as h2 evolution and fe3 reduction according to the reactions 14 2 h 2 e h 2 15 f e 3 e f e 2 both of which decreases the current efficiency and the yield of h2o2 generation another possible explanation for reaching a plateau in the dye removal at a current density of 6 ma cm2 is that as in the case of other diffusion controlled electrochemical reactions a limiting current is reached at high cell voltage at which the rate of h2o2 generation reaches a maximum any further increase in current result in h2 evolution at the cathode 3 3 effect of initial concentration of dye fig 7 illustrates the removal efficiency variation with initial dye concentrations the maximum dye removal after 1 h contact time was 94 5 91 6 88 3 and 86 7 for concentrations of 50 100 150 and 200 ppm at constant current density constant gas velocity and one layer of graphite this indicates that when the initial concentration of dye increases the dye removal decreases slightly due to incomplete oxidation of the dye probably because of the insufficient hydroxyl radicals concentration another possible explanation for the decrease in the dye removal at high initial dye concentration is the tendency of the dye molecules to agglomerate at high concentration to give clusters of low diffusion coefficient 33 this retard the rate of mixing of the dye with the o h radicals 3 4 effect of cathode bed height fig 8 demonstrates the effect of the number of graphite layers or bed height on the dye removal efficiency the data show for a given set of conditions the rate of dye removal increases with increasing the bed height up to 3 layers the improved performance of the reactor in dye removal at constant current density and constant superficial o2 velocity may be attributed to i the turbulence generated downstream of each layer as a result of hydrodynamic boundary layer separation from the cylinders forming the upstream layer 34 this turbulence enhances the rate of the diffusion controlled cathodic reduction of o2 to h2o2 at the downstream layers the turbulence improves also the mixing conditions in the inter electrode gap between h2o2 and the anodically generated fe2 with a consequent increase in o h radical concentration and rapid dye oxidation ii as the number of layers increases the cathode area increases with a subsequent increase in the total current i and the amount of generated h2o2 according to faraday s law fig 9 confirms the above result at different current densities the low dye removal rate obtained with one layer cathode compared to the high dye removal rate when a multi layer cathode is used underlines the important role played by the cathode thickness in the design of the present reactor especially at low current densities fig 9 shows that three and four layers cathode gave almost the same degree of dye removal rate at different current densities this suggests that a cathode with three layers at most is sufficient to produce maximum dye removal such a relatively thin cathode would lower the capital cost of the reactor by reducing the amount of carbon needed to build the cathode the fact that increasing the number of cathode layers beyond three doesn t improve the rate of dye removal may be explained by the decrease in cathode area caused by the blanketing effect of the gas bubbles held inside the bed the cathode area is also reduced by the shielding effect of the contact points between the cylinders 35 the dye removal reached 100 and remains constant at short contact time low current density and also at low superficial velocity for three and four graphite layers the optimum conditions for complete color removal of 50 ppm initial concentration of dye are at current density 2 ma cm2 superficial gas velocity 0 012 cm s and three layers of graphite cylinders 3 5 cod removal and sludge formation hydroxyl radicals produced from fenton reactions reacted with the dye so the color of the dye was removed as a result of dye molecule oxidation the color removal is not an evidence for the destruction of the dye this may be attributed to only the cleavage of chromophore responsible for the color with the formation of corresponding amines so three samples were taken to confirm the destruction of the dye molecules at the optimum conditions 3 layers of graphite o2 superficial velocity of 0 012 cm s a current density of 2 ma cm2 and 50 ppm initial concentration of dye the average removal of cod was 96 and this result confirmed the nearly complete removal of the dye at the end of each experiment the formed sludge was taken for analysis by dissolving 5 ml in 50 ml of nitric acid and then analyzed by hach colorimetric at λ 510 the analysis revealed the presence of 45 ppm ferric ions analyzed by icp mass spectroscopy also confirmed the existence of 57 ppm ferric ions these results indicate that this sludge is mainly ferric hydroxy complexes the high fe fe2 fe3 content arising from the anode dissolution of the sacrificial steel anode may suggest that electrocoagulation e c via dye adsorption on fe oh 3 may contribute to dye removal along with dye oxidation by h2o2 we believe that dye removal by e c is unlikely to take place under the present conditions in view of the following i the vigorous stirring induced by gas sparging would disperse the floc formed by dye adsorption on fe oh 3 36 ii even if the dye is adsorbed on fe oh 3 it will be oxidized by the cathodically generated h2o2 in the well mixed solution iii the present data figs 3 4 and 6 show that the dye removal increases with superficial gas velocity if dye removal was carried out by e c the dye removal would have decreased with increasing vg owing to dye redispersion by the stirring effect of gas bubbles iv no distinct floc layer adsorbed dye on fe oh 3 was observed at the solution upper surface such floating layer exists usually in the case of e c 3 6 electrical energy consumption energy consumption in kw h g of dye removed was calculated from the following equation 37 16 e n e r g y c o n s u m p t i o n e i 1000 m 17 m c o c f v 1000 t 60 fig 10 shows that energy consumption increases with increasing current density due to the increase in cell voltage which is given by the equations following 37 18 e e e q m η a η c i r 19 e e q m e c a t h o d e e a n o d e where cathode and anode potentials are calculated from the following equations 37 20 e c a t h o d e e o 0 059 2 log h 2 o 2 h 2 o p o 2 0 5 21 e c a t h o d e e o 0 059 2 log f e 2 and the cell resistance r can be approximated by the equation 37 22 r ρ l a ir is the ohmic drop due to the internal cell resistance the cell voltage increases with current density due to the increase in voltage drop ir and increasing activation polarization which is given by tafel s equation 38 39 23 η a a b log i where a and b are constants depending on electrode material and temperature gas sparging has two opposing effects on the cell voltage e and the energy consumption namely i it decreases concentration polarization η c with a consequent decrease in cell voltage and energy consumption ii on the other hand gas bubbles tend to increase the cell resistance ρ according to the following equation 40 24 ρ ρ o 1 ε 1 5 with a consequent increase in e and e c the cell voltage and the energy consumption for a single layer bed were found to decrease with increasing o2 superficial velocity i e the positive effect of reducing η c by gas bubbles overshadows the negative effect of increasing the cell resistance and the ir drop however the effect of superficial gas velocity on e c becomes less pronounced in the case of thick beds 2 and 3 layers probably because it is overshadowed by the increase in i and ir drop fig 11 shows that the influence of increasing superficial gas velocity on the energy consumption at different cathode thickness as increasing the cathode thickness the effect of superficial oxygen velocity on the power consumption becomes less effective this may be attributed to the increase of cathode area with increasing number of layers with a subsequent increase in the total current i as o2 superficial velocity increases the cell voltage decreases this may be attributed to the decrease in concentration polarization by the stirring effect of gas bubbles electrical energy consumption in the current study ranged from 0 003 to 0 29 kw h g depending on the operating conditions popescu et al 41 who used different carbonaceous cathode configurations reported a range of electrical energy consumption from 0 0175 to 0 186 kw h g at an applied current ranged from 0 05 to 0 3 a for the degradation of pyrimethanil brillas and casado 42 used electro fenton for the degradation of aniline solution with a carbon ptfe o2 fed cathode and different anode materials the range of electrical energy consumption was 0 011 to 0 45 kw h g 3 7 electro fenton kinetics dye degradation by electro fenton reaction is supposed to follow a pseudo first order reaction according to the equation 25 ln c o c k t fig 12 shows a typical plot of ln c o c versus time from which the values of the rate constant k were obtained the values of the rate constants were determined at different operating parameters current density initial dye concentration oxygen superficial velocity and number of graphite layers and are listed in table 1 the rate constant increases with increasing o2 superficial velocity and current density and decreases with increasing the initial concentration of dye increasing the number of graphite layers increases the rate constant and decreases treatment time but this increases the differential pressure across the reactor and increases the power consumption so two or three layers are sufficient for complete removal of dye as to the mineralization pathway of reactive red 195 no exact mechanism can be visualized owing to the difficulty of identifying the breakdown products formed during oxidation however dye mineralization probably takes place through successive formation of

pollutants that have negative effects on aquatic and human life 1 there are many ways for dye removal from aqueous solutions such as wet oxidation adsorption and biological treatment but these methods have some drawbacks such as low efficiency and high cost 2 4 electro fenton is one of the most advanced and cost effective oxidation processes for the removal of toxic organic compounds the process based on the in situ generation of hydroxyl radicals o h which are produced by the reaction of fenton reagent that consists of h2o2 and fe2 in acidic media 5 7 hydroxyl radicals are powerful oxidizing agents e 2 8 v vs nhe normal hydrogen electrode that react quickly and non selectively with nearly all electron rich organic compounds to produce co2 h2o and some intermediates 8 10 in the electro

fenton technology has been developed to eliminate a variety of contaminants and it has been discovered that cathode material and its structure play a major role in the success of this technology the cathode has a significant effect on the continuous production of h2o2 and hence on the reactive hydroxyl radicals carbonaceous cathode materials are acknowledged as more environmentally friendly economical and effective due to their high overpotential concerning water discharge 11 there are various types of carbonaceous cathodes reported in the literature such as graphite 12 carbon fiber brush 13 carbon sponge 14 reticulated vitreous carbon 15 carbon polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe 16 carbon nanotubes 17 carbon or graphite felt 18 and activated carbon fiber 19 20 despite these electrodes provided a high surface area per unit volume which is an important criterion in electrolytic cells but it suffers from a crucial disadvantage which lies in entrapping gas bubbles which tend to increase the cell resistance and blanket part of the cathode area 21 before o2 reduction at the graphite surface two mass transfer steps should take place namely mass transfer of o2 gas from o2 bubbles to the solution followed by mass transfer of the dissolved oxygen from the solution to the graphite surface 22 to achieve a high output rate of h2o2 and a high dye removal rate it is therefore necessary that oxygen transfer is increased to the cathode surface to this end the present work aims to study the performance of a new o2 sparged fixed bed electrochemical reactor in removing reactive red 195 dye from wastewater by the electro fenton technique the cell contains a fixed bed graphite cathode overlaid with a sacrificial steel screen stack anode made of low carbon steel 0 15 carbon variables studied were current density initial dye concentration oxygen sparging rate and number of graphite cathode layers fixed bed electrode has the advantage of high area per unit volume and a high space time yield beside the high rate of mass transfer 23 h2o2 will be electro generated at the graphite cathode by reduction of the continuously sparged oxygen while fe2 will be generated from a sacrificial steel anode placed downstream of the fixed bed cathode without adding any external chemicals the h2o2 level plays an important role in electro fenton reaction efficiency as it directly affects the theoretical peak of produced o h the efficiency of the process can be improved by increasing the electrically produced h2o2 but its overproduction or accumulation can result in counter productive effect due to the occurrence of reactions such ferrous ions regeneration by reduction of ferric ions with h2o2 eq 7 which may negatively affect the overall efficiency of the process 7 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h o 2 ᵒ h in addition unused portions of h2o2 may consume chemical oxidants during cod analyses resulting in an overestimation of cod values 24 there are alternative ways to continuously regenerate ferrous ions and enhance the efficiency of the process such as reduction of ferric ions at the cathode eq 8 or by reduction with hydroperoxyl radical ho2 eq 9 or by reduction with organic radical intermediates eq 10 25 27 8 f e 3 e f e 2 9 f e 3 h o 2 ᵒ f e 2 o 2 h 10 f e 3 r ᵒ f e 2 r 2 experimental part 2 1 materials reactive red 195 powder used in this study was supplied by the turkish tetco company the required experimental solutions with desired concentrations were prepared by dilution with distilled water the initial ph of the solution was adjusted at a value of 3 by using hcl and naoh solutions the supporting electrolyte of the cell is nacl because of the ability of c l to destroy passive films that might form on the anode especially at high current densities the dye structure is displayed in fig 1 2 2 experimental setup fig 2 describes the batch reactor where the electro fenton process was accomplished it consisted of a cylindrical plexiglass column of 24 cm height and 9 4 cm diameter a sintered glass was connected to the reactor bottom to achieve uniform oxygen flow distribution from an oxygen cylinder the cathode chamber was a porous stainless steel basket of 9 3 cm diameter randomly packed with layers of graphite each layer of graphite consisted of 69 small graphite cylinders of aspect ratio h d 1 each cylinder had a diameter of 7 mm the area of one graphite layer was calculated from the following equation 11 a r e a o f o n e g r a p h i t e l a y e r 69 2 π 4 d 2 π d h where d and h are the diameter and height of the graphite cylinder respectively so the total surface area of one layer of graphite is 159 39 cm2 the cathode chamber was placed at the bottom of the reactor the sacrificial anode consisted of five horizontal stacked steel screens of 9 3 cm in diameter made of low carbon steel 0 15 carbon the screen anode opening was 7 mm the distance between the cathode and anode was 3 cm the electrical circuit consisted of a direct current power supply 15 v with a voltage controller and a multi range ammeter connected in series with the cell a voltmeter was connected in parallel with the cell to measure its voltage to give an idea about the amount of iron dissolved from the sacrificial steel anode faraday s law was applied using a cell containing one layer cathode area 159 4 cm2 the amount of iron dissolved ranged from 0 167 to 1 336 g h for the current density range 1 8 ma cm2 respectively 2 3 experimental procedure 1 5 l of the prepared dye solution was introduced into the cell at the start of each run before each run the electrodes were pickled in dilute hcl to remove scales cleaned with distilled water followed by drying samples were taken every ten minutes during electrolysis for analysis by a spectrophotometer at the maximum wavelength of the dye which is 530 nm while cod removal was measured using the astm d1252 method each run lasted for 60 min the color removal efficiency was calculated using the equation 12 r e m o v a l c o c f c o 100 reproducibility of the results ranged from 3 to 5 the sacrificial screen anode was replaced by a new one from time to time 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of superficial o2 velocity figs 3 and 4 show the effect of superficial o2 velocity on the removal of dye the data show that dye removal increases with increasing superficial o2 velocity at different contact times and different current densities this result is attributed to the increase in the rate of mass transfer of o2 from bubbles to the solution and the increase in the rate of the diffusion controlled generation of h2o2 where diffusion plays an important role in the rate of h2o2 cathodic formation 28 29 the rate of h2o2 formation from dissolved o2 is given by the following equation 28 29 13 r h 2 o 2 i z f a d δ c c i increasing the superficial o2 not only maintains the bulk dissolved o2 concentration at the saturation value with a consequent increase in the driving force for the reaction but also decreases the diffusion layer thickness δ surrounding each carbon cylinder i e increases the mass transfer coefficient k of o2 reduction to h2o2 the increase in the bulk o2 concentration and the mass transfer coefficient increases the current i consumed in generating h2o2 with a consequent increase in the rate of h2o2 generation r h 2 o 2 according to faraday s law the decrease of diffusion layer δ by increasing superficial o2 velocity is ascribed to the turbulence s promoting ability of o2 bubbles and their ability to induce radial momentum as well as axial momentum 30 31 from fig 4 it is noteworthy that at higher current density a superficial o2 velocity of 0 04 cm s gave a maximum dye removal any increase in o2 velocity does not increase dye removal any further probably because the h2o2 generation reaction becomes a chemically controlled reaction which is not sensitive to stirring 3 2 effect of current density figs 5 and 6 show the effect of cathodic current density on the dye removal under different operating conditions the data show that in all cases the dye removal increases with increasing current density until it reaches a maximum value at 6 ma cm2 and then it almost remains constant with further increase in current density the increase in dye removal rate with current density is expected based on faraday s law m eit 32 according to which the amount of h2o2 generated by cathodic reduction of dissolved o2 and the amount of fe2 generated by anodic dissolution increases with increasing current density the increase in h2o2 and fe2 concentration is followed by an increase in the oxidizing free radical o h concentration according to eq 3 which oxidizes the dye molecules the fact that current densities higher than 6 ma cm2 don t improve the dye removal may be ascribed to side reactions taking place at the cathode along with h2o2 generation such as h2 evolution and fe3 reduction according to the reactions 14 2 h 2 e h 2 15 f e 3 e f e 2 both of which decreases the current efficiency and the yield of h2o2 generation another possible explanation for reaching a plateau in the dye removal at a current density of 6 ma cm2 is that as in the case of other diffusion controlled electrochemical reactions a limiting current is reached at high cell voltage at which the rate of h2o2 generation reaches a maximum any further increase in current result in h2 evolution at the cathode 3 3 effect of initial concentration of dye fig 7 illustrates the removal efficiency variation with initial dye concentrations the maximum dye removal after 1 h contact time was 94 5 91 6 88 3 and 86 7 for concentrations of 50 100 150 and 200 ppm at constant current density constant gas velocity and one layer of graphite this indicates that when the initial concentration of dye increases the dye removal decreases slightly due to incomplete oxidation of the dye probably because of the insufficient hydroxyl radicals concentration another possible explanation for the decrease in the dye removal at high initial dye concentration is the tendency of the dye molecules to agglomerate at high concentration to give clusters of low diffusion coefficient 33 this retard the rate of mixing of the dye with the o h radicals 3 4 effect of cathode bed height fig 8 demonstrates the effect of the number of graphite layers or bed height on the dye removal efficiency the data show for a given set of conditions the rate of dye removal increases with increasing the bed height up to 3 layers the improved performance of the reactor in dye removal at constant current density and constant superficial o2 velocity may be attributed to i the turbulence generated downstream of each layer as a result of hydrodynamic boundary layer separation from the cylinders forming the upstream layer 34 this turbulence enhances the rate of the diffusion controlled cathodic reduction of o2 to h2o2 at the downstream layers the turbulence improves also the mixing conditions in the inter electrode gap between h2o2 and the anodically generated fe2 with a consequent increase in o h radical concentration and rapid dye oxidation ii as the number of layers increases the cathode area increases with a subsequent increase in the total current i and the amount of generated h2o2 according to faraday s law fig 9 confirms the above result at different current densities the low dye removal rate obtained with one layer cathode compared to the high dye removal rate when a multi layer cathode is used underlines the important role played by the cathode thickness in the design of the present reactor especially at low current densities fig 9 shows that three and four layers cathode gave almost the same degree of dye removal rate at different current densities this suggests that a cathode with three layers at most is sufficient to produce maximum dye removal such a relatively thin cathode would lower the capital cost of the reactor by reducing the amount of carbon needed to build the cathode the fact that increasing the number of cathode layers beyond three doesn t improve the rate of dye removal may be explained by the decrease in cathode area caused by the blanketing effect of the gas bubbles held inside the bed the cathode area is also reduced by the shielding effect of the contact points between the cylinders 35 the dye removal reached 100 and remains constant at short contact time low current density and also at low superficial velocity for three and four graphite layers the optimum conditions for complete color removal of 50 ppm initial concentration of dye are at current density 2 ma cm2 superficial gas velocity 0 012 cm s and three layers of graphite cylinders 3 5 cod removal and sludge formation hydroxyl radicals produced from fenton reactions reacted with the dye so the color of the dye was removed as a result of dye molecule oxidation the color removal is not an evidence for the destruction of the dye this may be attributed to only the cleavage of chromophore responsible for the color with the formation of corresponding amines so three samples were taken to confirm the destruction of the dye molecules at the optimum conditions 3 layers of graphite o2 superficial velocity of 0 012 cm s a current density of 2 ma cm2 and 50 ppm initial concentration of dye the average removal of cod was 96 and this result confirmed the nearly complete removal of the dye at the end of each experiment the formed sludge was taken for analysis by dissolving 5 ml in 50 ml of nitric acid and then analyzed by hach colorimetric at λ 510 the analysis revealed the presence of 45 ppm ferric ions analyzed by icp mass spectroscopy also confirmed the existence of 57 ppm ferric ions these results indicate that this sludge is mainly ferric hydroxy complexes the high fe fe2 fe3 content arising from the anode dissolution of the sacrificial steel anode may suggest that electrocoagulation e c via dye adsorption on fe oh 3 may contribute to dye removal along with dye oxidation by h2o2 we believe that dye removal by e c is unlikely to take place under the present conditions in view of the following i the vigorous stirring induced by gas sparging would disperse the floc formed by dye adsorption on fe oh 3 36 ii even if the dye is adsorbed on fe oh 3 it will be oxidized by the cathodically generated h2o2 in the well mixed solution iii the present data figs 3 4 and 6 show that the dye removal increases with superficial gas velocity if dye removal was carried out by e c the dye removal would have decreased with increasing vg owing to dye redispersion by the stirring effect of gas bubbles iv no distinct floc layer adsorbed dye on fe oh 3 was observed at the solution upper surface such floating layer exists usually in the case of e c 3 6 electrical energy consumption energy consumption in kw h g of dye removed was calculated from the following equation 37 16 e n e r g y c o n s u m p t i o n e i 1000 m 17 m c o c f v 1000 t 60 fig 10 shows that energy consumption increases with increasing current density due to the increase in cell voltage which is given by the equations following 37 18 e e e q m η a η c i r 19 e e q m e c a t h o d e e a n o d e where cathode and anode potentials are calculated from the following equations 37 20 e c a t h o d e e o 0 059 2 log h 2 o 2 h 2 o p o 2 0 5 21 e c a t h o d e e o 0 059 2 log f e 2 and the cell resistance r can be approximated by the equation 37 22 r ρ l a ir is the ohmic drop due to the internal cell resistance the cell voltage increases with current density due to the increase in voltage drop ir and increasing activation polarization which is given by tafel s equation 38 39 23 η a a b log i where a and b are constants depending on electrode material and temperature gas sparging has two opposing effects on the cell voltage e and the energy consumption namely i it decreases concentration polarization η c with a consequent decrease in cell voltage and energy consumption ii on the other hand gas bubbles tend to increase the cell resistance ρ according to the following equation 40 24 ρ ρ o 1 ε 1 5 with a consequent increase in e and e c the cell voltage and the energy consumption for a single layer bed were found to decrease with increasing o2 superficial velocity i e the positive effect of reducing η c by gas bubbles overshadows the negative effect of increasing the cell resistance and the ir drop however the effect of superficial gas velocity on e c becomes less pronounced in the case of thick beds 2 and 3 layers probably because it is overshadowed by the increase in i and ir drop fig 11 shows that the influence of increasing superficial gas velocity on the energy consumption at different cathode thickness as increasing the cathode thickness the effect of superficial oxygen velocity on the power consumption becomes less effective this may be attributed to the increase of cathode area with increasing number of layers with a subsequent increase in the total current i as o2 superficial velocity increases the cell voltage decreases this may be attributed to the decrease in concentration polarization by the stirring effect of gas bubbles electrical energy consumption in the current study ranged from 0 003 to 0 29 kw h g depending on the operating conditions popescu et al 41 who used different carbonaceous cathode configurations reported a range of electrical energy consumption from 0 0175 to 0 186 kw h g at an applied current ranged from 0 05 to 0 3 a for the degradation of pyrimethanil brillas and casado 42 used electro fenton for the degradation of aniline solution with a carbon ptfe o2 fed cathode and different anode materials the range of electrical energy consumption was 0 011 to 0 45 kw h g 3 7 electro fenton kinetics dye degradation by electro fenton reaction is supposed to follow a pseudo first order reaction according to the equation 25 ln c o c k t fig 12 shows a typical plot of ln c o c versus time from which the values of the rate constant k were obtained the values of the rate constants were determined at different operating parameters current density initial dye concentration oxygen superficial velocity and number of graphite layers and are listed in table 1 the rate constant increases with increasing o2 superficial velocity and current density and decreases with increasing the initial concentration of dye increasing the number of graphite layers increases the rate constant and decreases treatment time but this increases the differential pressure across the reactor and increases the power consumption so two or three layers are sufficient for complete removal of dye as to the mineralization pathway of reactive red 195 no exact mechanism can be visualized owing to the difficulty of identifying the breakdown products formed during oxidation however dye mineralization probably takes place through successive formation of different oxidized compounds as suggested by lv et al 43 ho studied the degradation of levofloxacin antibiotic by a phot electro fenton process oxidation ends up with the formation of formic and oxalic acids which upon further oxidation mineralize to h2o and co2 naturally the breakdown products formed during dye mineralization differ from those produced by levofloxacin mineralization 4

13548,disinfection is a sanitary treatment present in both drinking water and wastewater treatment plants aimed at removing pathogenic microorganisms able to damage the human health the focus of this study is to apply computational fluid dynamics cfd to study and to improve the disinfection efficiency through the optimization of the hydrodynamics inside the disinfection tank numerous literature studies have shown that water flow inside traditional multichamber tanks is highly turbulent because of the development of large as well as small vortices in which flow velocity decreases or even vanishes dead zones these turbulent phenomena are responsible of an increase of the real residence time compared to the theoretical one causing poor disinfection and the development of unwanted by products in the present analysis large eddy simulation les is used to simulate three dimensional turbulent flow and disinfectant transport in different contact tanks using a structured finite volume discretization the results show how the baffles geometry as well as the design of technical and construction details influences the hydraulic retention time of the disinfectant varying the disinfection efficiency in particular the creation of horizontal baffles inside the vertical baffle chambers reduces the free space and extends the flow path this reduces both short circuits and recirculation zones bringing the flow closer to the ideal plug flow condition keywords disinfection computational fluid dynamics cfd large eddy simulation les contact tank baffle design 1 introduction the most common disinfection methods in water treatments involve the use of chemicals and in particular chlorine and its compounds and ozone disinfection treatments through chemical reagents are generally carried out inside rectangular contact tanks where the presence of parallel baffles forces the flow to follow a serpentine path with 180 flow inversions that increase the contact time of the bacteria with the chemical reagent used for disinfection 1 fluid motion in serpentine disinfection tanks like most of fluid dynamic processes in real systems is a turbulent process i e a nonstationary irregular and chaotic motion characterized by the presence of eddies of different sizes and speeds which continuously change plug flow reactor is undoubtedly the most widely used type of reactor in chemical disinfection treatments in these systems the tracer concentration within each cross section is constant while the dispersion in the longitudinal direction is almost zero in this way the real hydraulic residence time hrt of the plug flow reactor is equal to the theoretical one established in the design phase plug flow reactors ensure therefore a perfect hydraulic and sanitary performance of water disinfection processes 2 traditional disinfection processes take place inside reactors with rectangular chambers separated by horizontal or vertical baffles this geometric configuration causes the development of several areas characterized by whirling motions 3 where the speed decreases or even vanish causing the disinfectant entrapment 4 these turbulent phenomena deeply modify the operating system with respect to the ideal plug flow condition and since the recirculation zones occupy a considerable portion of the tank volume they modify the real hydraulic residence time from the theoretical one 5 even though the baffles are able to avoid the short circuiting phenomena which occurs when particles pass through a reactor quicker than the theoretical hrt the wide vortices within the cavities trap disinfectants and pathogens which are then retained in the tank for a longer period than the theoretical hydraulic residence time 5 the occurrence of such flow patterns has a detrimental effect on the overall treatment efficiency since an increase in contact time could cause the generation of harmful by products while its decrease could cause a poor disinfection 6 this happens in particular in the case of chlorine disinfection where the formation of disinfection by products dpbs depends on the disinfectant s concentration in the tank and on its reactions with other water constituents 7 in the case of disinfectants that do not produce disinfection by products on the other hand previous studies show that increasing the contact time is favorable 8 recently computational fluid dynamics cfd is increasingly applied to analyze elements of water treatment plants due to the ability of a numerical approach to achieve fast and economic results with respect to the conventional experimental methods 4 5 9 the most analysed element is perhaps the disinfection unit different chamber shapes have been simulated 3 10 12 and different turbulence models have been employed showing how both the shape of the domain as well as the turbulence model greatly influence the results 10 13 14 in many studies reynolds averaged navier stokes rans based turbulence models have been used with significant time savings as they require lower computational costs 15 however even though rans simulations are able to predict the mean flow inside the tank it has been demonstrated 13 that they are not able to predict smaller scale eddies that cause disinfectant entrapment at corners these recirculation zones could be better simulated with large eddy simulation les models capable of accurately assessing the variation of turbulent fluctuations 16 17 undoubtedly les techniques require the use of a finer resolution mesh and therefore they involve higher computational costs nevertheless nowadays thanks to recent technological advances the scientific community is paying more and more attention to les techniques which allow greater precision and reliability of results also in industrial applications where usually rans has been used 18 in terms of computational costs les represents a valid compromise between rans and direct numerical simulation dns techniques dns is in fact a numerical method where all the turbulence scales of motion are directly resolved without the introduction of specific turbulence models unfortunately dns requires a huge amount of compute cells resulting in high computational costs on the other hand les is designed to resolve the large scales responsible for the production of kinetic energy whereas the small scales responsible for the energy dissipation are modelled with the consequent reduction of computational costs furthermore les models are the only ones able to accurately simulate the disinfectant mixing with the flow 4 9 which is of fundamental importance in tracer studies in light of all this in the present analysis less are applied to investigate disinfection efficiency in multichamber reactors with the aim of optimizing the tank design to improve disinfection hydraulic and chemical performances of new or existing reactors as previously mentioned in the literature there are numerous examples of computational fluid dynamics studies conducted with the aim of optimizing the hydrodynamics in disinfection tanks all these studies focused the attention on the effect of the contact tank geometries thus to reach an ideal plug flow condition the main objective of this study is to provide further insights of this issue exploring alternative geometries able to optimize the hydraulic performance a fundamental challenge is to find a simple geometry for new tanks or for the upgrading of existing tanks the hydrodynamic improvement of the tank is evaluated considering the hydraulic efficiency indicators typical of these studies the results showed that the number and arrangement of the baffles the width of the chambers and the number of inversions are responsible of the disinfection efficiency the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the physical problem and the numerical model solver is described section 3 presents the validation test cases where geometries already studied in literature were reproduced and compared in section 4 the results obtained in the new designed contact tanks are shown and discussed in the final section main findings are summarized and conclusions are drawn 2 numerical approach in the study of treatment plants the application of numerical techniques allows to reduce the design times and to choose the optimal hydrodynamic configuration nowadays this is a fundamental point for the scientific community that works in these areas since it would help engineers in improving facility designs and consequently bring economic benefits before construction 2 1 governing equations of fluid flow turbulent flows as previously mentioned are resolved using les approach based on the numerical solution of the filtered continuity and momentum equations given by 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j f i where ui and xi are velocity and position in the i th direction t is time ρ is fluid density p is pressure ν is the kinematic viscosity and fi represents the force per unit of mass in the i th direction the governing equations are resolved using the second order accurate numerical model openfoam open source field operations and manipulations cfd direct ltd reading uk specifically the transient solver pimplefoam available for incompressible and turbulent flow of newtonian fluids has been used in this study this solver is a combination of piso pressure implicit split operator and simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations solvers the pimple algorithm is composed of an implicit momentum predictor and several pressure velocity correctors in the pimple loop the velocity equations are firstly solved by using the velocity and pressure fields of the previous time step known as momentum predictor the velocity and pressure are corrected several times afterwards to satisfy mass conservation specifically the algorithm solves a pressure equation to enforce mass conservation with an explicit velocity correction to satisfy the momentum conservation different les subgrid models are available for incompressible flows in this case wall adapting local eddy viscosity wale model has been used where the eddy viscosity is modelled by 3 μ t ρ l s 2 s i j d s i j d 3 2 s i j s i j 5 2 s i j d s i j d 5 4 where μt is the subgrid scale turbulent viscosity ls is the mixing length for

k k 2 with g i j u i x j 2 2 governing equations for tracer transport the hydraulic efficiency of multichamber reactors in terms of disinfection capacity is evaluated considering the flow of a non reactive tracer inserted inside the tank to obtain the mean residence time in cfd simulations a passive scalar tracer is a conservative substance that is transported along the volume of fluid without interfering with local hydrodynamics 19 tracer studies are performed by inserting the tracer at the reactor inlet and measuring the response at the outlet in order to obtain residence time statistics 20 in this specific case the tracer is injected with a uniform distribution from the inlet for a time of 2 5 s and the outlet concentration variation is monitored throughout the numerical simulation in order to simulate the transport of the conservative tracer standard solver pimplefoam is modified including the following advection diffusion equation 7 c t u j c x j x j d d t c x j where u j is the velocity component along the j direction x y and z t is the time xi and xj represent the cartesian coordinates c is the filtered tracer concentration d is molecular diffusivity which is negligible compared to turbulent diffusivity dt the turbulent diffusivity can be computed as dt μt sc where μt is eddy viscosity calculated in 3 while sc is the turbulent schmidt number which is set to 1000 in order to maintain the same ratio between the water molecular viscosity and the tracer mass diffusivity used in the experiments by kim et al 6 21 2 3 flow domain simulation setup and boundary conditions the reactor model used in the present study to simulate flow and tracer transport in disinfection treatments has geometric characteristics identical to those used in the other literature studies in order to make possible a comparison of the results obtained for the validation of the numerical model the most recent studies concerning multichamber reactors are based on physical tracer experiments conducted by kim et al 6 the laboratory scale contactor used in the aforementioned study consisted of 12 chambers while the same author performed computational simulations on a truncated version of the reactor 4 also used in the present study in order to reduce the computational cost in the truncated reactor the number of chambers is reduced from 12 to 4 while maintaining the same chamber width equal to 0 113 m in this way the reactor has an overall longitudinal length of 0 48 m and a width of 0 23 m the deflectors have a height of 0 18 m while the water reaches a height of 0 21 m inside the reactor as shown in fig 1 the water enters the reactor with a constant discharge of 0 2 l s from the inlet located at the left of the first chamber and flows from the outlet on the opposite side of the multichamber the computational domain is decomposed through a cartesian grid fig 2 using 210 90 90 cells in the streamwise spanwise and wall normal directions respectively in analogy with the study of demirel and aral 2 for a total of 1 701 000 cells the cells size was determined following a sensitivity analysis establishing a greater refinement of the grid near the bottom and baffle walls in order to resolve steep velocity gradients in order to compare the numerical results with the previous literature studies the same boundary conditions have been applied to the domain in particular the effects of roughness on the walls have been neglected and zerogradient and no slip conditions have been imposed on the walls for pressure and velocity respectively other boundary conditions available in openfoam and applied on the bottom and on the walls are kqrwallfunction and nutkwallfunction for the turbulence kinetic energy and for the turbulence viscosity respectively as previously mentioned in the present study numerical simulations have been performed on the truncated version of the physical domain studied by kim et al 6 to reduce the computational time in order to ensure the validity of the numerical simulation periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise direction have been applied for velocity this boundary conditions make the results independent on the inlet turbulence intensity avoiding unwanted flow disturbances that occur when different boundary conditions are applied to the inlet and outlet 10 a uniform tracer concentration is injected into the tank applying a fixedvalue boundary condition for the tracer in such a way that the scalar enters uniformly from the entire inlet cross section while zerogradient boundary condition is used at the outlet and walls symmetry boundary condition is finally imposed on the upper face of the domain since free surface effects are negligible 4 22 numerical simulations are conducted using openfoam code which solves the governing equations through the finite volume method for the temporal discretization of the governing equations the second order backward scheme is used a 0 005 s time step is set to maintain the courant friedrich levy cfl number below 0 5 as regards the space linearupwind and gauss linear schemes are used for the treatment of the convective and diffusive terms respectively so that the overall accuracy of the numerical method is second order initially the flow inside the reactor was simulated without the tracer for a time of 300 s in order to allow the flow field stabilization excluding the wake fluctuations generally observed during the initial phases of a simulation 2 once the flow field is established the tracer is released inside the tank for a period of 2 5 s and the simulation is run for an additional 330 s to ensure that almost all the injected tracer passes through the outlet 3 validation of the numerical procedure the aim of this study is to analyze hydrodynamics inside disinfection tanks characterized by technical and construction details allowing the flow to be brought closer to the ideal plug flow condition and therefore optimizing the efficiency of the disinfection process in light of this literature studies have shown that it is possible to avoid the development of short circuits and recirculation phenomena by increasing the number of compartments 11 while making slots in the baffles it is possible to increase mixing in the chambers reducing dead zones 23 before proceeding to the analysis of the flow inside tanks having different characteristics from the traditional ones it was necessary to validate the accuracy of the les approach and the numerical methods used through a comparison with previous literature studies in order to validate the numerical procedure three different reactors already analysed in literature have been tested the traditional four chamber reactor shown in fig 1 identified below as nw normal chamber width the eight chamber reactor fig 3 a obtained by doubling the number of baffles thus halving the width of the chambers and therefore called hw half chamber width the reactor model presented by aral and demirel 2017 in the study novel slot baffle design to improve mixing efficiency and reduce cost of disinfection in drinking water treatment characterized by the presence of three slots for each baffle and hereafter identified as slot baffle fig 3b 3 1 flow characteristics fig 4 presents the time averaged absolute velocity distribution along with two dimensional streamlines depicted in the last two chambers of each figure fig 4a shows how the nw reactor is characterized by a preferential serpentine flow at greater speed white contours which extends near the right side of each chamber and suggests the occurrence of short circuits inside the reactor when the flow leaves a chamber its velocity increases with respect to the theoretical average ubulk due to the presence of the crest of the baffles this area is therefore characterized by the presence of a sort of jet at high speed that extends from one room to another the high flow velocity determines the passage of a portion of water through the entire length of the contactor in much shorter times than the average hydraulic residence time with consequent short circuit and therefore a reduction in disinfection efficiency the streamlines show that the entire central part of the chambers is occupied by a large recirculation zone a small secondary recirculation area is observed instead at the corners between the bottom and the baffle walls while near the water surface no recirculation occurs finally a small recirculation cell appears near the baffles free end the ability of the les to capture the presence of this last recirculation zone explains why the latter is preferred to rans simulation which is unable to simulate smaller scale eddies at the entrance of the chambers 13 fig 4b shows that the hw reactor has flow characteristics similar to the nw reactor however by halving the chamber width the size of the primary recirculation zone is considerably smaller occupying approximately half of the chamber there is again a small secondary recirculation zone at the corners between the bottom and the walls of the deflector and unlike the nw model another small recirculation cell appears at the corners near the free surface finally fig 4c shows that the presence of slots in the baffles improves the overall mixing efficiency of the contact tank since when the flow exits from the slot hit the recirculation zone and increases the mixing downstream the deflector avoiding short circuits and the excessive permanence of the disinfectant trapped in the recirculation and dead zones the qualitative comparison of the contour and of the streamlines achieved in the present simulations are in good agreement with the results observed in the literature of reference in order to confirm the validity of the method further quantitative comparison based on velocity and concentration profiles are presented below for the validation of the numerical method the velocity profiles obtained across the chamber width have been compared with literature data for each reactor fig 5 shows the normalized vertical velocity profiles obtained in a chamber at three different vertical heights the results obtained are in good agreement with the data present in the literature for each model of reactor specifically at all three depths investigated in nw model the y velocity varies through the chamber passing from negative to positive values this happens because the presence of recirculation and dead zones prevents a uniform distribution of speed as it is possible to observe for nw and hw models the y velocity in each chamber is greater along the right wall in correspondence with the preferential path followed by the flow however in hw model the y velocity vector exhibits the greatest change of direction at depth y h 0 27 since the recirculation zone occupies only a small part in the bottom of the chamber on the contrary at the depth y h 0 5 the negative values of the y velocity decrease disappearing completely at y h 0 72 finally as regards the slot baffle model the jet that comes out of the slots creates a mixing that disturbs the dead and recirculation zones for this motive the direction change of the y velocity vector is small at all the depths investigated and the velocity profiles not shown here assume a pseudo horizontal trend that approaches that of an ideal plug flow reactor pfr 3 2 tracer analysis the hydraulic efficiency of disinfection tanks is generally evaluated considering the flow of a passive scalar tracer injected from the inlet for a time of 2 5 s the tracer distribution analysis is based on the examination of the rtd residence time distribution and crtd cumulative residence time distribution curves obtained at the outlet fig 6 shows that also in this case the results obtained are in perfect agreement with the literature data for the three models studied in particular the first peak of the normalized rtd graph obtained for the nw model indicates that high quantities of tracer leave the reactor after a shorter time than the theoretical hydraulic residence time τ this confirms that conventional reactors suffer from short circuit phenomena that reduce disinfection efficiency the second peak on the other hand appears due to the presence of the recirculation areas that trap the tracer delaying its release in the hw model the second peak of rtd completely disappears due to the minimization of the recirculation zones whereas the first peak moves to the right since the reduction of the chamber width reduces the short circuiting effects the rtd trend is getting closer to the plug flow ideal one in the case of the slot baffle model where the peak value is significantly smaller and appears even later and closer to the theoretical hydraulic residence time in the abscissa of rtd plot there is θ t τ which is the nondimensionalized time with respect to the theoretical mean residence time τ v q while in the ordinate there is the tracer concentration which is nondimensionalized using 8 e θ c c i n i t t r e l e a s e τ where cinit 1 is the uniform concentration of tracer injected at the inlet and trelease 2 5 s is the injection period cumulative normalized rtd plot is obtained by integrating the rtd curve 9 f θ 0 e θ d θ from the cumulative rtd plot it is possible to determine the indices usually used to evaluate the hydraulic and mixing efficiencies of contact tanks table 1 shows the comparison between literature data and the values of the hydraulic efficiency indicators hei considered in the present study in particular t10 τ and t90 τ represent the normalized times starting from the introduction of the tracer respectively necessary for the passage through the outlet of 10 and 90 of the mass of the tracer injected the morrill coefficient is defined as mo t90 t10 and is an indicator of the mixing degree in the tank 24 σ2 is the dispersion index and represents the variance of the rtd curve the dispersion index is defined as 10 σ 2 σ t 2 t g 2 11 with σ t 2 τ 2 0 θ 2 e θ d θ 0 e θ d θ 12 and t g τ 0 θ e θ d θ 0 e θ d θ where σ t 2 is the variance of the rtd curve and tg is the normalized time to reach the centroid of the effluent curve 25 as it is possible to observe from the table the hei values of the three reactor models here analysed are in agreement with the crtd curves obtained in literature physical experiments and computational simulations 4 performance of the new designed reactor with horizontal baffles the results shown in the validation section showed how the chamber width hw reactor model is responsible of the disinfection process improvement reducing the short circuit effects and the development of recirculation zones and bringing the flow closer to the ideal plug flow condition for this reason in the present study focused to design new geometrical chambers able to optimize the hydraulic and sanitary efficiencies new contact tanks were analysed thus to reduce the dimension of the contact tank chambers fig 7 depicts the proposed geometries where horizontal baffles are added to the classical vertical ones these extremely regular geometries are simple to construct or possibly to implement in existing tanks with the aim of extending the flow path bringing the hydraulic residence time closer to the theoretical ideal one in fig 7a the reactor model is designed thus to ensure the same dimension of the flow path equal to 28 cm the same height is also chosen for the inlet section on the other hand in the second tested geometry shown in fig 7b a variable section through which the flow passes is considered fig 8 shows the streamlines superimposed to the contour of the non dimensional velocity the streamlines compared with those observed in fig 4 show how the presence of the horizontal baffles reduces the development of dead zones and the recirculation regions moreover the disinfectant is forced to remain inside the reactor for a longer time bringing the flow closer to the ideal plug flow condition it can be thus observed that the introduction of horizontal baffles improves the disinfectant dispersion comparing the two new designs plotted in fig 8 it is evident how the number of horizontal baffles determines variations in the recirculation regions affecting the turbulent mixing and the disinfectant dispersion in order to investigate on the performance of the new designed contact tanks the rtd curves and the cumulative normalized rtd curves are plotted in fig 9 a and 9b respectively the figure shows how the horizontal baffles are responsible of the disappearance of the second peak evident in the conventional contact tank at θ 0 65 this is due to the dead zones reduction where usually the disinfectant remains trapped and released after times moreover the single peak of the curve shifts to the right and approaches to θ 1 indicating a considerable reduction in short circuit effect focusing on the two new designs with horizontal baffles it can be observed how constant section reactor allows a greater shift of the peak towards the ideal condition with an almost impulsive behavior this result is in agreement with the streamlines shown in fig 8 where it was observed a reduction of recirculation regions compared with those occurring in the variable section reactor table 2 shows the us epa 26 classification of the hydraulic performance of a contact tank based on the baffle factor t10 τ thanks to this classification it is possible to subdivide the performance of the contact tanks in 5 different condition mixed flow t10 τ 0 1 poor condition 0 1 t10 τ 0 3 average condition 0 3 t10 τ 0 5 superior condition 0 5 t10 τ 0 7 and finally plug flow condition when t10 τ 1 general regulations instead suggest that morril mo and dispersion σ2 coefficients should be close to 1 and 0 respectively to ensure a perfect mixing and plug flow condition within the system from the analysis of the hei values determined by the crtd curves in fig 9b and reported in table 3 it is possible to observe that for both horizontal baffled geometries values closer to the ideal have been obtained compared to the conventional geometry however as previously observed from the rtd curve also based on the hei indices determined by the crtd curve the reactor model in which the flow passes through a section that remains constant along the entire path shows the highest performance the improvement of the disinfection in the proposed contact tanks with horizontal baffles superimposed to the vertical ones can be attributed to the drastic reduction of the recirculation region in order to confirm this achieved result a new geometrical parameter based on region occupied by the stable reversal flows is investigated this parameter is defined as recirculation factor rf and is calculated according to the following equation 13 r f 1 v r v t o t where vr is the volume of tank occupied by the recirculation zones and vtot is the overall volume of the reactor the rf coefficient spans the range 0 1 it assumes an ideal value of 0 when the entire tank volume is occupied by eddies and dead zones on the other hand it is equal to 1 in ideal plug flow conditions where no recirculation regions occur in fig 10 the baffling factor t10 τ has been related to the recirculation factor to show how the reduction of the recirculation areas in the tank allows an increase in hydraulic efficiency fig 10 shows how the presence of horizontal baffles leads to an increase in the rf compared to traditional multichamber geometries presented in the validation section nw 4 chambers and hw 8 chambers the insertion of horizontal baffles therefore allows to reduce the volume of recirculation areas improving the reactor hydraulic efficiency specifically in the horizontal baffled reactor with variable section hor variable a value of t10 τ equal to 0 690 is achieved for a rf of 0 50 while in the constant section model hor constant the recirculation reduction allows an increase in rf to a value of 0 63 corresponding to a baffling factor equal to 0 854 further analysis are required to confirm the validity of the proposed coefficient finally fig 11 presents the normalized vertical velocity profiles predicted inside a horizontal chamber for both horizontal baffled designs as it is possible to observe for both models the velocity magnitude between two horizontal baffles is close to the ideal plug flow velocity profile with a slightly closer trend for the constant section reactor furthermore there are no negative speed values since the geometry does not allow the development of recirculation or dead zones 5 conclusions les turbulence approach is employed in order to accurately simulate and predict big and small recirculation zones in the tank tracer studies show that the conventional tank designs suffer from high short circuiting and low mixing resulting in poor disinfection efficiency this study proposes a new contact tank design with horizontal baffles that add to the traditional vertical ones the new baffles configuration increases the number of flow reversals and reduces the free section for the flow to pass this results in the reduction of short circuit phenomena and in the disappearance of the recirculation areas largely present inside the chambers of traditional tanks the proposed design is constructively simple to implement as it consists in adding horizontal baffles to the already existing vertical ones this small constructive device brings the disinfectant residence time in the tank closer to the theoretical hrt reducing high disinfectant dosage used in traditional chlorine treatment plants which may be risky for human and public health the simulations conducted have shown that by reducing the space between two consecutive horizontal baffles it is possible to obtain greater hydraulic efficiency in particular for the design in which the baffles are arranged in such a way that the flow can pass through a constant section at each point of the tank a t10 index of 0 85 was obtained much higher than the value of the traditional design t10 0 35 and very close to the ideal plug flow value t10 1 declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest 
13548,disinfection is a sanitary treatment present in both drinking water and wastewater treatment plants aimed at removing pathogenic microorganisms able to damage the human health the focus of this study is to apply computational fluid dynamics cfd to study and to improve the disinfection efficiency through the optimization of the hydrodynamics inside the disinfection tank numerous literature studies have shown that water flow inside traditional multichamber tanks is highly turbulent because of the development of large as well as small vortices in which flow velocity decreases or even vanishes dead zones these turbulent phenomena are responsible of an increase of the real residence time compared to the theoretical one causing poor disinfection and the development of unwanted by products in the present analysis large eddy simulation les is used to simulate three dimensional turbulent flow and disinfectant transport in different contact tanks using a structured finite volume discretization the results show how the baffles geometry as well as the design of technical and construction details influences the hydraulic retention time of the disinfectant varying the disinfection efficiency in particular the creation of horizontal baffles inside the vertical baffle chambers reduces the free space and extends the flow path this reduces both short circuits and recirculation zones bringing the flow closer to the ideal plug flow condition keywords disinfection computational fluid dynamics cfd large eddy simulation les contact tank baffle design 1 introduction the most common disinfection methods in water treatments involve the use of chemicals and in particular chlorine and its compounds and ozone disinfection treatments through chemical reagents are generally carried out inside rectangular contact tanks where the presence of parallel baffles forces the flow to follow a serpentine path with 180 flow inversions that increase the contact time of the bacteria with the chemical reagent used for disinfection 1 fluid motion in serpentine disinfection tanks like most of fluid dynamic processes in real systems is a turbulent process i e a nonstationary irregular and chaotic motion characterized by the presence of eddies of different sizes and speeds which continuously change plug flow reactor is undoubtedly the most widely used type of reactor in chemical disinfection treatments in these systems the tracer concentration within each cross section is constant while the dispersion in the longitudinal direction is almost zero in this way the real hydraulic residence time hrt of the plug flow reactor is equal to the theoretical one established in the design phase plug flow reactors ensure therefore a perfect hydraulic and sanitary performance of water disinfection processes 2 traditional disinfection processes take place inside reactors with rectangular chambers separated by horizontal or vertical baffles this geometric configuration causes the development of several areas characterized by whirling motions 3 where the speed decreases or even vanish causing the disinfectant entrapment 4 these turbulent phenomena deeply modify the operating system with respect to the ideal plug flow condition and since the recirculation zones occupy a considerable portion of the tank volume they modify the real hydraulic residence time from the theoretical one 5 even though the baffles are able to avoid the short circuiting phenomena which occurs when particles pass through a reactor quicker than the theoretical hrt the wide vortices within the cavities trap disinfectants and pathogens which are then retained in the tank for a longer period than the theoretical hydraulic residence time 5 the occurrence of such flow patterns has a detrimental effect on the overall treatment efficiency since an increase in contact time could cause the generation of harmful by products while its decrease could cause a poor disinfection 6 this happens in particular in the case of chlorine disinfection where the formation of disinfection by products dpbs depends on the disinfectant s concentration in the tank and on its reactions with other water constituents 7 in the case of disinfectants that do not produce disinfection by products on the other hand previous studies show that increasing the contact time is favorable 8 recently computational fluid dynamics cfd is increasingly applied to analyze elements of water treatment plants due to the ability of a numerical approach to achieve fast and economic results with respect to the conventional experimental methods 4 5 9 the most analysed element is perhaps the disinfection unit different chamber shapes have been simulated 3 10 12 and different turbulence models have been employed showing how both the shape of the domain as well as the turbulence model greatly influence the results 10 13 14 in many studies reynolds averaged navier stokes rans based turbulence models have been used with significant time savings as they require lower computational costs 15 however even though rans simulations are able to predict the mean flow inside the tank it has been demonstrated 13 that they are not able to predict smaller scale eddies that cause disinfectant entrapment at corners these recirculation zones could be better simulated with large eddy simulation les models capable of accurately assessing the variation of turbulent fluctuations 16 17 undoubtedly les techniques require the use of a finer resolution mesh and therefore they involve higher computational costs nevertheless nowadays thanks to recent technological advances the scientific community is paying more and more attention to les techniques which allow greater precision and reliability of results also in industrial applications where usually rans has been used 18 in terms of computational costs les represents a valid compromise between rans and direct numerical simulation dns techniques dns is in fact a numerical method where all the turbulence scales of motion are directly resolved without the introduction of specific turbulence models unfortunately dns requires a huge amount of compute cells resulting in high computational costs on the other hand les is designed to resolve the large scales responsible for the production of kinetic energy whereas the small scales responsible for the energy dissipation are modelled with the consequent reduction of computational costs furthermore les models are the only ones able to accurately simulate the disinfectant mixing with the flow 4 9 which is of fundamental importance in tracer studies in light of all this in the present analysis less are applied to investigate disinfection efficiency in multichamber reactors with the aim of optimizing the tank design to improve disinfection hydraulic and chemical performances of new or existing reactors as previously mentioned in the literature there are numerous examples of computational fluid dynamics studies conducted with the aim of optimizing the hydrodynamics in disinfection tanks all these studies focused the attention on the effect of the contact tank geometries thus to reach an ideal plug flow condition the main objective of this study is to provide further insights of this issue exploring alternative geometries able to optimize the hydraulic performance a fundamental challenge is to find a simple geometry for new tanks or for the upgrading of existing tanks the hydrodynamic improvement of the tank is evaluated considering the hydraulic efficiency indicators typical of these studies the results showed that the number and arrangement of the baffles the width of the chambers and the number of inversions are responsible of the disinfection efficiency the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the physical problem and the numerical model solver is described section 3 presents the validation test cases where geometries already studied in literature were reproduced and compared in section 4 the results obtained in the new designed contact tanks are shown and discussed in the final section main findings are summarized and conclusions are drawn 2 numerical approach in the study of treatment plants the application of numerical techniques allows to reduce the design times and to choose the optimal hydrodynamic configuration nowadays this is a fundamental point for the scientific community that works in these areas since it would help engineers in improving facility designs and consequently bring economic benefits before construction 2 1 governing equations of fluid flow turbulent flows as previously mentioned are resolved using les approach based on the numerical solution of the filtered continuity and momentum equations given by 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j f i where ui and xi are velocity and position in the i th direction t is time ρ is fluid density p is pressure ν is the kinematic viscosity and fi represents the force per unit of mass in the i th direction the governing equations are resolved using the second order accurate numerical model openfoam open source field operations and manipulations cfd direct ltd reading uk specifically the transient solver pimplefoam available for incompressible and turbulent flow of newtonian fluids has been used in this study this solver is a combination of piso pressure implicit split operator and simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations solvers the pimple algorithm is composed of an implicit momentum predictor and several pressure velocity correctors in the pimple loop the velocity equations are firstly solved by using the velocity and pressure fields of the previous time step known as momentum predictor the velocity and pressure are corrected several times afterwards to satisfy mass conservation specifically the algorithm solves a pressure equation to enforce mass conservation with an explicit velocity correction to satisfy the momentum conservation different les subgrid models are available for incompressible flows in this case wall adapting local eddy viscosity wale model has been used where the eddy viscosity is modelled by 3 μ t ρ l s 2 s i j d s i j d 3 2 s i j s i j 5 2 s i j d s i j d 5 4 where μt is the subgrid scale turbulent viscosity ls is the mixing length for

k k 2 with g i j u i x j 2 2 governing equations for tracer transport the hydraulic efficiency of multichamber reactors in terms of disinfection capacity is evaluated considering the flow of a non reactive tracer inserted inside the tank to obtain the mean residence time in cfd simulations a passive scalar tracer is a conservative substance that is transported along the volume of fluid without interfering with local hydrodynamics 19 tracer studies are performed by inserting the tracer at the reactor inlet and measuring the response at the outlet in order to obtain residence time statistics 20 in this specific case the tracer is injected with a uniform distribution from the inlet for a time of 2 5 s and the outlet concentration variation is monitored throughout the numerical simulation in order to simulate the transport of the conservative tracer standard solver pimplefoam is modified including the following advection diffusion equation 7 c t u j c x j x j d d t c x j where u j is the velocity component along the j direction x y and z t is the time xi and xj represent the cartesian coordinates c is the filtered tracer concentration d is molecular diffusivity which is negligible compared to turbulent diffusivity dt the turbulent diffusivity can be computed as dt μt sc where μt is eddy viscosity calculated in 3 while sc is the turbulent schmidt number which is set to 1000 in order to maintain the same ratio between the water molecular viscosity and the tracer mass diffusivity used in the experiments by kim et al 6 21 2 3 flow domain simulation setup and boundary conditions the reactor model used in the present study to simulate flow and tracer transport in disinfection treatments has geometric characteristics identical to those used in the other literature studies in order to make possible a comparison of the results obtained for the validation of the numerical model the most recent studies concerning multichamber reactors are based on physical tracer experiments conducted by kim et al 6 the laboratory scale contactor used in the aforementioned study consisted of 12 chambers while the same author performed computational simulations on a truncated version of the reactor 4 also used in the present study in order to reduce the computational cost in the truncated reactor the number of chambers is reduced from 12 to 4 while maintaining the same

21 m inside the reactor as shown in fig 1 the water enters the reactor with a constant discharge of 0 2 l s from the inlet located at the left of the first chamber and flows from the outlet on the opposite side of the multichamber the computational domain is decomposed through a cartesian grid fig 2 using 210 90 90 cells in the streamwise spanwise and wall normal directions respectively in

and recirculation zones for this motive the direction change of the y velocity vector is small at all the depths investigated and the velocity profiles not shown here assume a pseudo horizontal trend that approaches that of an ideal plug flow reactor pfr 3 2 tracer analysis the hydraulic efficiency of disinfection tanks is generally evaluated considering the flow of a passive scalar tracer injected from the inlet for a time of 2 5 s the tracer distribution analysis is based on the examination of the rtd residence time distribution and crtd cumulative residence time distribution curves obtained at the outlet fig 6 shows that also in this case the results obtained are in perfect agreement with the literature data for the three models studied in particular the first peak of the normalized rtd graph obtained for the nw model indicates that high quantities of tracer leave the reactor after a shorter time than the theoretical hydraulic residence time τ this confirms that conventional reactors suffer from short circuit phenomena that reduce disinfection efficiency the second peak on the other hand appears due to the presence of the recirculation areas that trap the tracer delaying its release in the hw model the second peak of rtd completely disappears due to the minimization of the recirculation zones whereas the first peak moves to the right since the reduction of the chamber width reduces the short circuiting effects the rtd trend is getting closer to the plug flow ideal one in the case of the slot baffle model where the peak value is significantly smaller and appears even later and closer to the theoretical hydraulic residence time in the abscissa of rtd plot there is θ t τ which is the nondimensionalized time with respect to the theoretical mean residence time τ v q while in the ordinate there is the tracer concentration which is nondimensionalized using 8 e θ c c i n i t t r e l e a s e τ where cinit 1 is the uniform concentration of tracer injected at the inlet and trelease 2 5 s is the injection period cumulative normalized rtd plot is obtained by integrating the rtd curve 9 f θ 0 e θ d θ from the cumulative rtd plot it is possible to determine the indices usually used to evaluate the hydraulic and mixing efficiencies of contact tanks table 1 shows the comparison between literature data and the values of the hydraulic efficiency indicators hei considered in the present study in particular t10 τ and t90 τ represent the normalized times starting from the introduction of the tracer respectively necessary for the passage through the outlet of 10 and 90 of the mass of the tracer injected the morrill coefficient is defined as mo t90 t10 and is an indicator of the mixing degree in the tank 24 σ2 is the dispersion index and represents the variance of the rtd curve the dispersion index is defined as 10 σ 2 σ t 2 t g 2 11 with σ t 2 τ 2 0 θ 2 e θ d θ 0 e θ d θ 12 and t g τ 0 θ e θ d θ 0 e θ d θ where σ t 2 is the variance of the rtd curve and tg is the normalized time to reach the centroid of the effluent curve 25 as it is possible to observe from the table the hei values of the three reactor models here analysed are in agreement with the crtd curves obtained in literature physical experiments and computational simulations 4 performance of the new designed reactor with horizontal baffles the results shown in the validation section showed how the chamber width hw reactor model is responsible of the disinfection process improvement reducing the short circuit effects and the development of recirculation zones and bringing the flow closer to the ideal plug flow condition for this reason in the present study focused to design new geometrical chambers able to optimize the hydraulic and sanitary efficiencies new contact tanks were analysed thus to reduce the dimension of the contact tank chambers fig 7 depicts the proposed geometries where horizontal baffles are added to the classical vertical ones these extremely regular geometries are simple to construct or possibly to implement in existing tanks with the aim of extending the flow path bringing the hydraulic residence time closer to the theoretical ideal one in fig 7a the reactor model is designed thus to ensure the same dimension of the flow path equal to 28 cm the same height is also chosen for the inlet section on the other hand in the second tested geometry shown in fig 7b a variable section through which the flow passes is considered fig 8 shows the streamlines superimposed to the contour of the non dimensional velocity the streamlines compared with those observed in fig 4 show how the presence of the horizontal baffles reduces the development of dead zones and the recirculation regions moreover the disinfectant is forced to remain inside the reactor for a longer time bringing the flow closer to the ideal plug flow condition it can be thus observed that the introduction of horizontal baffles improves the disinfectant dispersion comparing the two new designs plotted in fig 8 it is evident how the number of horizontal baffles determines variations in the recirculation regions affecting the turbulent mixing and the disinfectant dispersion in order to investigate on the performance of the new designed contact tanks the rtd curves and the cumulative normalized rtd curves are plotted in fig 9 a and 9b respectively the figure shows how the horizontal baffles are responsible of the disappearance of the second peak evident in the conventional contact tank at θ 0 65 this is due to the dead zones reduction where usually the disinfectant remains trapped and released after times moreover the single peak of the curve shifts to the right and approaches to θ 1 indicating a considerable reduction in short circuit effect focusing on the two new designs with horizontal baffles it can be observed how constant section reactor allows a greater shift of the peak towards the ideal condition with an almost impulsive behavior this result is in agreement with the streamlines shown in fig 8 where it was observed a reduction of recirculation regions compared with those occurring in the variable section reactor table 2 shows the us epa 26 classification of the hydraulic performance of a contact tank based on the baffle factor t10 τ thanks to this classification it is possible to subdivide the performance of the contact tanks in 5 different condition mixed flow t10 τ 0 1 poor condition 0 1 t10 τ 0 3 average condition 0 3 t10 τ 0 5 superior condition 0 5 t10 τ 0 7 and finally plug flow condition when t10 τ 1 general regulations instead suggest that morril mo and dispersion σ2 coefficients should be close to 1 and 0 respectively to ensure a perfect mixing and plug flow condition within the system from the analysis of the hei values determined by the crtd curves in fig 9b and reported in table 3 it is possible to observe that for both horizontal baffled geometries values closer to the ideal have been obtained compared to the conventional geometry however as previously observed from the rtd curve also based on the hei indices determined by the crtd curve the reactor model in which the flow passes through a section that remains constant along the entire path shows the highest performance the improvement of the disinfection in the proposed contact tanks with horizontal baffles superimposed to the vertical ones can be attributed to the drastic reduction of the recirculation region in order to confirm this achieved result a new geometrical parameter based on region occupied by the stable reversal flows is investigated this parameter is defined as recirculation factor rf and is calculated according to the following equation 13 r f 1 v r v t o t where vr is the volume of tank occupied by the recirculation zones and vtot is the overall volume of the reactor the rf coefficient spans the range 0 1 it assumes an ideal value of 0 when the entire tank volume is occupied by eddies and dead zones on the other hand it is equal to 1 in ideal plug flow conditions where no recirculation regions occur in fig 10 the baffling factor t10 τ has been related to the recirculation factor to show how the reduction of the recirculation areas in the tank allows an increase in hydraulic efficiency fig 10 shows how the presence of horizontal baffles leads to an increase in the rf compared to traditional multichamber geometries presented in the validation section nw 4 chambers and hw 8 chambers the insertion of horizontal baffles therefore allows to reduce the volume of recirculation areas improving the reactor hydraulic efficiency specifically in the horizontal baffled reactor with variable section hor variable a value of t10 τ equal to 0 690 is achieved for a rf of 0 50 while in the constant section model hor constant the recirculation reduction allows an increase in rf to a value of 0 63 corresponding to a baffling factor equal to 0 854 further analysis are required to confirm the validity of the proposed coefficient finally fig 11 presents the normalized vertical velocity profiles predicted inside a horizontal chamber for both horizontal baffled designs as it is possible to observe for both models the velocity magnitude between two horizontal baffles is close to the ideal plug flow velocity profile with a slightly closer trend for the constant section reactor furthermore there are no negative speed values since the geometry does not allow the development of recirculation or dead zones 5 conclusions les turbulence approach is employed in order to accurately simulate and predict big and small recirculation zones in the tank tracer studies show that the conventional tank designs suffer from high short circuiting and low mixing resulting in poor disinfection efficiency this study proposes a new contact tank design with horizontal baffles that add to the traditional vertical ones the new baffles configuration increases the number of flow reversals and reduces the free section for the flow to pass this results in the reduction of short circuit phenomena and in the disappearance of the recirculation areas largely present inside the chambers of traditional tanks the proposed design is constructively simple to implement as it consists in adding horizontal baffles to the already existing vertical ones this small constructive device brings the disinfectant residence time in the tank closer to the theoretical hrt reducing high disinfectant dosage used in traditional chlorine treatment plants which may be risky for human and public health the simulations conducted have shown that by reducing the space between two consecutive horizontal baffles it is possible to obtain greater hydraulic efficiency in particular for the design in which the baffles are arranged in such a way that the flow can pass through a constant section at each point of the tank a t10 index of 0 85 was obtained much higher than the value of the traditional design t10 0 35 and very close to the ideal plug flow value t10 1 declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest 
13549,log removal values lrv for a range of pathogens in membrane bioreactors mbrs were aggregated for 180 sampling events across 11 municipal scale installations important correlations were established between lrv for biological lrvbio and physical lrvmem inactivation with reactor conditions ph temperature solid and hydraulic retention times srt hrt and mixed liquor suspended solids mlss membrane properties pore size and flux operational variables and filtrate quality lrvbio correlated positively and significantly between all microorganism indicators and dissolved organic carbon doc becoming a suitable monitoring technique for biological removal lrvmem correlated positively for protozoa indicators and bacteria consistent with size exclusion as a predominant removal mechanism strong correlations between lrv for protozoa virus and bacteria indicators were established at lower flux tmp and mlss higher ph and temperature and longer solids and hydraulic retention time the implications of this study provide important guidance for the validation of mbrs producing safe and consistent recycled water keywords lrv mbr validation protozoa virus bacteria cryptosporidium 1 introduction pathogenic microorganisms originating from sewage are the primary hazard in water recycling due to the potential for acute health effects from exposure to very low dosages 18 direct measurement of pathogenic species in wastewater is often not feasible due to low and highly variable concentrations and long turnaround time analysis procedures for which expertise is scarce 1 from an industry perspective extensive requirements to demonstrate pathogen removal have been recognised as a significant challenge that limits the feasibility of incorporating membrane bioreactors mbrs into water recycling schemes especially in the case of smaller utilities to develop more appropriate guidelines for validation of pathogen removal it is critical to quantify the impact of system design and operating conditions on the mbr performance 2 ideally influencing factors in the form of operational parameters could have defined limits set within which the trend of lrv is known and meets acceptable treatment targets these limits could constitute the safe operating envelope if maintained within the safe operating envelope an mbr would be expected to provide fit for purpose water with greater certainty a better understanding of factors influencing lrv would help to inform more rationalized test plans for permitting activities at full scale facilities ultimately leading to more economical and better understood results notwithstanding discrepancies in terminology used in the literature there are four primary mechanisms of removal within an mbr size exclusion by the membrane entrainment within the dynamic membrane fouling layer adsorption to activated sludge flocs and bio predation 3 no single mechanism can be defined as the sole contributor to rejection of pathogens through mbr the pathogen specific properties are expected to determine the dominant removal mechanism a number of operating factors have been identified to significantly influence pathogen removal in mbr including membrane pore size 4 hydraulic retention time hrt and resulting concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss 5 fouling membrane cleaning and ageing 6 7 and flux or transmembrane pressure tmp and permeability 8 a substantial amount of lrv data has been reported for mbrs recent reviews have summarized available virus removal data 9 investigated specific adsorption tendencies 10 11 and other removal mechanisms of pathogenic viruses 12 13 and proposed modelling approaches for virus lrv 14 in our recent review we identified that a majority of mbr lrv data points were reported without a complete or standardized set of key operational parameters or have been determined at lab or pilot scale resulting in uncertainty of full scale performance 15 additionally this statistical review clearly established that the correlation of operating parameters and pathogen removal performance was not yet possible with available reported data as a result identification of the significance and trends of influencing factors has not been possible with currently available data in addition limited studies 16 18 have quantified protozoa removal due to the perception that protozoa are larger than the mbr pore size and will be completely removed unfortunately without data to support protozoa removal it has been difficult to obtain regulatory approval for mbrs in potable recycling trains salveson et al 2021 this study includes analysis of a presumptive indicator microorganism for protozoa removal c perfringens as well as lrv results for cryptosporidium and giardia the protozoa of most concern in water recycling the aim of this study was to define an operating envelope for full scale mbrs by statistical assessment of a large body of paired lrv and operating parameters in addition surrogate measures for lrv of pathogens including indicator microorganism and physiochemical parameters such as dissolved organic carbon doc and turbidity were evaluated to inform their use as monitoring techniques for pathogen removal the source data for this study was collected over the course of 18 months during a rigorous sampling regime of 11 full scale mbrs from around australia during this sampling period over 180 site sampling visits were made and on each visit indicator lrv and operating parameters were recorded to the authors knowledge a sampling campaign of this magnitude covering multiple mbrs that aimed to collect pair and report operating and lrv data has not been attempted to date 2 method 2 1 data collection a total of 11 full scale mbrs were sampled during this study on each visit influent activated sludge and permeate were sampled and analysed for multiple parameters membrane parameters including configuration pore size material installed filtration area age from installation supplier and model are shown in table 1 a majority of installations studied utilized hollow fibre membranes 8 11 and the most common membrane material was polyvinylidenedifluoride pvdf 7 11 given the unequal sampling from different membrane configurations flat sheet vs hollow fibre and materials detailed analysis of these factors was not included to avoid analysis bias should further data be collected it may be of interest to ascertain if membrane material or configuration impacts lrv at scale however this would require similarly aged and operated installations at each site indicator microorganisms bulk parameters and operational data was collected and analysed a summary of samples parameters and analysis methods undertaken for each site visit is included in table 2 the full range of data paired based on sample day is provided as supplementary data 2 2 calculated parameters flux j was calculated by dividing total permeate flow rate to sample point recorded on scada by membrane area connected to sample point from site design information and is reported in units of l m 2 h 1 eq 1 1 j l m 2 h 1 p e r m e a t e f l o w r a t e l h 1 m e m b r a n e a r e a m 2 if multiple membrane trains were connected to a sample point and both trains were in operations then the average of flux calculated for each train was used trains that were not producing water but were connected to the sample point were not included in averaging calculations temperature correction of flux was achieved with eq 2 as reported in 21 2 j 20 l m 2 h 1 j t 1 03 20 t where j20 and jt are the flux corrected to 20 c and the operating flux at a bioreactor temperature of t c respectively eq 2 was chosen over the method listed in the membrane filtration guidance manual mfgm 22 for two reasons 1 eq 2 was empirically derived from activated sludge measurements and not based solely the relationship of pure water viscosity with temperature and 2 a method comparison demonstrated eq 2 was more sensitive to change in temperature than with the mfgm viscosity approach i e eq 2 varied flux more than the usepa method per degree change in temperature transmembrane pressure tmp is the difference between permeate and feed pressure across a membrane some sites calculated feed pressure based on hydraulic head from the membrane halfway point to the tank level the calculation method appeared subject to error in the form of negative tmp even when the pump withdraws permeate as a result a more robust method utilising installed site pressure transducers was used to ensure consistency between sites tmp was calculated with eq 3 by using the onsite pressure transducer installed between the membranes and the permeate pump eq 3 is valid provided membrane tank level and module height is constant which was the case for all sites 3 t m p k p a p j 0 p j where pj 0 and pj are the suction pressure readings in kpa observed on the pressure transducer between the membrane and permeate pump at 0 l m 2 h 1 i e when the pump is off and operating flux j respectively pj 0 is a site specific constant provided tank level and membrane position are constant permeability k was calculated by dividing flux by tmp eq 4 4 k l m 2 h 1 k p a 1 j l m 2 h 1 t m p k p a permeability normalised to 20 c k20 was calculated by substituting j20 the flux normalised to 20 c using eq 2 for j solid retention time srt was calculated on a monthly basis in order to allow for mbrs where intermittent sludge wasting was practiced a monthly basis was deemed appropriate as in most cases 1 month was greater than the operating srt and as a result the calculated value could be assumed close to equilibrium eq 5 5 s r t d v m 3 d a y s i n m o n t h d t o t a l m o n t h l y s l u d g e w a s t a g e m 3 where v was the total mbr operating volume including membrane tanks and biological zones hydraulic retention time hrt was calculated based on the previous 24 h flow taking into account for intermittent operation similar to srt eq 6 6 h r t h v m 3 24 h t o t a l d a i l y f l o w m 3 2 3 data analysis and correlation parameters were correlated using spss software v 23 ibm due to the high rate of censored data i e permeate readings less than the detection limit it was deemed inappropriate to use the typical pearson s r correlation statistic in place of pearson s r kendall s tau τ was used similar to pearson s r τ provides a statistic between 1 and 1 a value close to 1 or 1 indicating a good positive or negative correlation respectively τ is a non parametric correlation statistic that does not assume linearity but correlates based on rank order 23 24 if a positive τ close to 1 occurs when correlating variables a with b then low values of a occur paired with low values of b which implies a direct proportionality between a and b for a negative τ close to 1 low values of a occur paired with high values of b i e there is an inverse proportionality between a and b tied values i e if one variable remains constant until the variable for correlation reaches a certain limit will also result in a higher τ value the utility of τ incorporating tied values allows correlations of data sets that incorporate censored values below a detection limit as the level of detection lod acts as a tied value τ is therefore preferable to use of pearson s r as the values below the lod would either have to be omitted or changed possibly resulting in erroneous correlations 24 three different lrv values were calculated in order to differentiate between removal mechanisms 15 while lrvmbr eq 7 represented overall process removal by comparing influent and permeate microorganism densities lrvbio eq 8 considered influent and mixed liquor densities and is representative of removal due to biological predation only finally lrvmem eq 9 was calculated with mixed liquor and permeate densities and is representative of removal of microorganisms by the membrane and fouling layer given the nature of the sampling approach only the overall contributions of both the biological system and the membrane separation can be assessed as a result it was not possible to quantify some of the pathogen removal mechanisms such as adsorption on biological flocs deposition on the membrane surface known to occur in mbr 7 l r v m b r log 10 c i n c p e r m 8 l r v b i o log 10 c i n c m l 9 l r v m e m log 10 c m l c p e r m prior to correlation any reading that was below the lod was changed to the tied value of the lod for lrv values with censored permeate data the lod was used to calculate a conservative censored lrv the smallest lrv was then determined for each microorganism and used as a tied upper bound lrv value this was the lrv at which all removal performance below resulted in detection for 100 percent of observations all lrvs that were greater than the smallest lrv were then substituted for the tied value of the smallest lrv for example the smallest censored lrvmbr for e coli was 6 3 this means that for a lrvmbr less than 6 3 e coli was always detected all e coli lrvmbr that were greater than 6 3 were substituted for 6 3 prior to correlation and determination of τ correlation significance was assessed at three levels using the p value p from a two tailed test a significant correlation was defined as having a p less than 0 01 and a very significant correlation defined as having a p of less than 0 001 in this study a p value greater than 0 05 was defined as a cut off indicating that two variables were not significantly correlated 2 4 assessment of the impact of pore size only three different nominal membrane product pore sizes 0 04 0 1 and 0 4 μm were reported across all investigated sites a majority of sites investigated utilised membranes with reported nominal pore size of 0 04 μm with the exception of site 1 and site 7 where pore sizes were 0 4 and 0 05 μm respectively given the importance of size exclusion as a mechanism in pathogen reduction by mbr it was deemed necessary to assess the impact of pore size however as the data set was heavily biased towards pore sizes of 0 04 μm and featured a limited range of only 3 different pore sizes it was considered inappropriate to perform correlations instead the lrvmbr distributions calculated as probability density functions pdfs as described in 15 were compared for the master data set and for the data set comprising only those sites with reported pore size of 0 1 μm 2 5 pathogen analysis samples were taken for analysis of giardia cryptosporidium enteroviruses adenoviruses and reoviruses on 8 occasions across sites 3 and 9 samples were transported to sydney water corporations west ryde laboratories swc on the day of sampling in a cooler containing ice blocks for each of the two sites 2 1 l samples of influent and activated sludge were taken on 4 occasions and 2 100 l of permeate on three occasions for analysis of protozoa and viruses swc utilised an in house national association of testing authorities nata accredited method for analysis of giardia and cryptosporidium based on 25 dapi staining was used for confirmation of cysts and oocysts prior to analysis permeate samples were concentrated by swc using ultrafiltration uf results reported in this document are corrected for recovery and refer to dapi positive dapi cyst or oocyst counts giardia and cryptosporidium were not detected in any of the six 100 l permeate samples taken lrv was calculated for same day samples using the limit of detection lod 1 dapi org 100 l adjusted for the worst recovery as a result reported lrvs for protozoa are conservative for virus analysis an in house nata accredited tissue culture method for analysis of enteroviruses adenoviruses and reoviruses to yield most probable number mpn influent and activated sludge samples were concentrated via peg precipitation prior to analysis 100 l permeate samples were concentrated using uf similar methods to those used by swc have been reported previously 26 adenovirus enteroviruses and reoviruses were not detected in any of the six 100 l permeate samples taken lrv was calculated for same day samples using the limit of detection lod 1 mpn 100 l for enteroviruses and adenoviruses and 3 6 mpn 100 l for reoviruses as a result reported lrvs for viruses are conservative 3 results and discussion 3 1 establishment of an operating envelope the operating data collected alongside lrvs during the sampling campaign is summarised in table 3 in order to summarise the range and any skewness of operating parameters the 5th and 95th percentile ile interquartile range 25th and 75th ile average and median values are reported due to data recording failures and installation differences between sites some operating parameters were not available data set completeness e g number of values of total possible was also reported to express any absence of paired operating parameters the impact of pore size on lrv was assessed and a subset of data was created the operating envelope corresponding to mbrs where reported nominal pore size was below 0 1 μm is summarised in table 4 the range of lrvs and correlations presented in the following sections is considered valid within the range of operating conditions listed in table 4 in general mbrs would be designed to remove nutrients under the most economically viable configuration to achieve this a minimum srt and hrt would be defined such that nitrification and denitrification would reliably occur a design flux would be defined to deal with average dry weather flows and a maximum flux to manage wet weather events typical mbr pilot demonstration parameters reported previously were 10 40 d srt 5 12 h hrt and fluxes from 25 40 l m 2 h 1 21 the intent of the sampling campaign in this study was to quantify the lrv of mbrs under normal operation it is of note that the srts and hrts of the installations studied were higher and the flux was typically lower than those reported in previous demonstrations the lower flux and longer hrt and srt is symptomatic of some of the mbrs being oversized relative to operating requirements during the sampling campaign another symptom of the mbrs in this study being oversized is that mlss is generally on the lower end when compared to pilot demonstrations that targeted bioreactor mlss levels of 8 14 g l 1 21 to that end care should be taken extrapolating the lrv results contained herein outside the ranges proposed in tables 3 and 4 3 2 impact of nominal pore size on lrv the pdfs of the lrvmbr are shown for c perfringens e coli sc and frna in figs 1 4 respectively for the master data set of c perfringens the lrvmbr pdf featured a high standard deviation this was likely a result c perfringens accumulation within the bioreactor increase by 1 4 log indicating that if breakthrough occurred a higher permeate density would be observed the subset for membranes installed with a nominal pore size of less than 0 1 μm exhibited a much lower standard deviation with a 5th ile of 5 2 almost double that for the master data set 5th ile lrv for all c perfringens was 2 5 fig 1 a mean and standard deviation lrvmbr for c perfringens of 4 9 and 0 82 respectively was reported for a full scale mbr in a previous study van den akker et al 2014 along with lrvmbr of 3 9 5 0 reported in a separate study 16 both these observations fall within the range of values observed in this work it is possible that membranes reported as having a nominal pore size of 0 4 μm may feature a small number of macropores larger than c perfringens 0 6 1 0 μm 27 which may allow passage of c perfringens when nominal pore size is reduced to less than 0 1 μm it is suggested that the number of macropores big enough to allow transport of c perfringens also decreases resulting in a higher and less variable lrvmbr the 5th ile e coli lrvmbr was 4 8 for the total data set and 5 5 for membranes with pore sizes of 0 1 μm indicating significant overall removal the higher removal of e coli when compared to c perfringens was likely due to the contribution of the bioreactor lrvbio to lrvmbr which reduced e coli densities by 0 9 log from influent to activated sludge fig 2 interestingly the median value 7 1 was identical for both data sets which may imply that the smaller pore size reduced removal variability without shifting performance to appreciably higher values in other work mean e coli lrvmbr has been reported between 5 and 7 16 and separately with a mean 5 0 and standard deviation of 0 7 van den akker et al 2014 in general agreement with the results of this work our own separate analysis indicated a 5th percentile lrvmbr of 3 8 which extends to below the values observed in our analysis 15 sc lrvmbr 5th iles were 1 7 and 2 0 for the total data set and 0 1 μm subset respectively prior reviews have reported sc lrvmbr between 2 7 and 5 3 from a number of sources 9 the 5th and 95th percentile in this study was 1 7 5 7 which corresponds closely with this range but does extend to lower values in a previous review using similar monte carlo lrv calculation techniques in this work a 5th percentile sc lrvmbr from a range of literature data was 1 1 15 similarly frna exhibited little change when observing the subset of smaller pore sizes with 5th ile lrvs of 3 4 and 3 5 removal of frna has been reported in recent reviews between 3 5 and 7 1 9 and in our previous analysis of other literature a 5th percentile of 2 7 was calculated 15 in general agreement with this study even though wild sc can exhibit much larger variation in size than frna 4 it would appear this is not a primary factor governing the observed removal rather the resistance of sc to biological treatment resulted in a greater density against the membrane leading to a higher rate of detection in the permeate with 72 of permeate samples above the lod by contrast frna bacteriophage median lrvbio was 1 2 log units and was only detected in 20 of permeate samples figs 3 and 4 unfortunately the assays used do not identify specific species of frna or sc that might be present as such as mechanistic discussion of the potential impact of iso electric point or relative virus indicator size cannot be used to explain results frna lrvmbr of between 4 6 and 6 were observed alongside sc lrvmbr of 2 7 4 0 by a mbr equipped with a 0 4 μm membrane in a previous study 28 the observation of more conservative removal of sc relative to frna was in agreement with the results of this work 3 3 correlation of lrvmem with operating parameters common membrane specific operating parameters including tmp flux and permeability were shortlisted for correlation with lrvmem in addition specific cst i e cst divided by mlss to summarise sludge filterability was also compared finally lrvmem correlations were assessed against temperature directly and also flux and permeability normalised for temperature eqs 1 2 and 4 the correlation of turbidity with indicators is reported in table 6 and with lrvmem and lrvmbr in table 7 τ values for lrvmem c perfringens tc e coli and sc are included in table 5 sc lrvmem could not be significantly correlated with any of the shortlisted parameters flux was negatively correlated with lrvmem for c perfringens τ 0 29 p 0 001 but not with any other organism tested tmp was negatively correlated with both tc and e coli lrvmem τ 0 18 0 23 p 0 001 permeability was positively correlated with tc and e coli implying that a more fouled membrane exhibited a lower lrvmem τ 0 19 0 25 p 0 001 in a previous study lower rejection of antibiotic resistant bacteria was observed at a higher tmp which then stabilized at even higher tmps when membranes were irrecoverably fouled in agreement with the observations made in this work 29 the negative permeability to lrvmem correlation may have occurred due to the independence of flux on e coli and tc meaning that an inverse of the already negatively correlated tmp would yield a positive correlation this is further supported by the similarity in the magnitude of τ values for e coli and tc noted for permeability and tmp it should be noted that 5th and 95th percentile values of lrvmem for e coli and tc were 4 5 to 6 3 and 4 3 to 7 2 respectively see supplementary information for transformed tc and ec lrvmem the high 5th percentile indicates that there is significant benefit with bacterial removal by the membrane regardless of tmp and permeability and that these trends were only observed for already to high lrvs 4 unfortunately lrvmem as measured accounts for both the impact of size exclusion of the intact membrane and fouling on lrv which means that exact contributions of fouling to lrv are not able to be elucidated in this study normalisation of flux and permeability for temperature identified the same trends as un normalised parameters and resulted in the same or a slightly increased correlation coefficient when compared with the raw values i e the τ values between c perfringens lrvmem and j and j20 were 0 29 and 0 34 respectively therefore it may be advisable that when reporting of challenge test data normalisation of flux and permeability to a reference temperature should be carried out specific cst correlated significantly and positively indicating that higher lrvmem is expected for poorly filterable sludge τ 0 16 0 51 p 0 001 the much higher correlation coefficient for c perfringens τ 0 51 compared to e coli and tc τ 0 16 0 17 may be due to the strong correlation of activated sludge c perfringens densities and mlss concentration table 6 3 4 correlation of indicator concentrations in order to evaluate the necessity for measurement of multiple indicators an initial correlation was performed to assess occurrence of different indicator microorganisms at the same sample location i e c perfringens influent densities were compared to those of e coli and also to compare the densities of the same indicator throughout the process i e c perfringens densities were compared in the influent and activated sludge non microbial surrogates including doc measurements mlss and permeate turbidity were also correlated with indicator microorganism densities from the same sampling location table 6 in general indicator microorganisms were weakly but significantly correlated to each other in the influent wastewater τ 0 11 0 32 p 0 001 with the exception being tc and c perfringens and frna and sc for which no correlation could be found between these two organisms pairs activated sludge densities of all indicators correlated well τ 0 11 0 42 p 0 001 with the exception of frna which did not correlate with either c perfringens or sc in this work and in previously reported literature 16 both c perfringens and sc have displayed tendencies to accumulate within the bioreactor i e lrvbio 0 whereas frna is typically removed to a significant extent within the activated sludge the disparate actions of biological removal mechanisms on frna as opposed to c perfringens and sc may have led to the absence of any correlation correlation of permeate frna was problematic as only 24 of readings were detected and only 10 of readings were above the detection limit no significant correlation could be found between permeate frna and any other indicator a weak negative correlation τ 0 17 p 0 01 existed between permeate c perfringens and frna correlations for c perfringens permeate were also uncertain as only 26 of measurements were at or above the detection limit the combination of low detection rate on both c perfringens and frna means that there is greater uncertainty in any correlation between the two as such the negative correlation may be meaningless with the exception of frna all indicators displayed significant positive correlations with turbidity in the permeate τ 0 18 0 36 p 0 001 supporting the use of turbidity as monitoring technique in mbr correlations between the same indicator in the influent and activated sludge were positive and significant τ 0 19 0 47 p 0 001 influent and permeate densities were only significantly correlated for the smaller virus indicators frna and sc τ 0 24 and 0 50 p 0 001 whereas for the larger bacteria and protozoan indicators c perfringens e coli and tc correlations were either slightly significant e g tc τ 0 12 p 0 01 or not correlated it was previously suggested that the independence of influent and permeate densities indicated by a null correlation as seen in table 6 was a result of significant removal by size exclusion with the exception of infrequent and random detections likely caused by disturbances to the fouling layer sporadically un shielding potential membrane defects 30 3 5 correlation of indicator reduction in order to identify similarities in fate and removal of different indicators and surrogate measures lrvmbr lrvbio and lrvmem were compared for microorganism indicators doc removal calculated as an lrv i e log10 docin docout and permeate turbidity table 7 as mentioned in section 2 3 the minimum censored lrv value was determined and substituted for all higher lrvs to allow correlation without omission of data unfortunately the lowest censored lrvmbr and lrvmem for frna were 2 0 and 1 0 respectively and there were less than 3 lrv lower than these values as a result correlations for frna were not possible apart from for lrvbio lrvbio correlated positively and significantly between all microorganism indicators and lrvdoc τ 0 21 0 40 p 0 001 indicating the potential for development of a doc monitoring protocol to allow for biological removal to be considered a critical control point lrvbio and lrvmbr for lrvdoc were strongly and significantly correlated τ 0 63 p 0 001 this is advantageous as if control point monitoring correlations were to be developed between biological removal of pathogens and lrvdoc the mbr permeate is a less harsh monitoring environment when compared to the activated sludge lrvmem correlated positively and significantly between organisms larger than the membrane pore size tc e coli and c perfringens τ 0 36 0 61 p 0 001 likely due to size exclusion being the predominant mechanism of removal for these indicators in addition permeate turbidity was significantly negatively correlated with lrvmem of e coli tc and c perfringens indicating higher removals across the membrane at lower turbidities τ 0 19 0 32 p 0 01 by contrast lrvmem for sc was not significantly correlated with any other indicator or parameter lrvmbr correlated positively and significantly for all indicator microorganisms and lrvdoc τ 0 18 0 62 p 0 001 lrvmbr correlated negatively with permeate turbidity for all indicators including sc τ 0 17 0 29 p 0 01 3 6 correlation of lrvbio with operating parameters operating parameters that were perceived to have a possible effect on lrvbio included bioreactor ph aerobic zone do temperature srt hrt mlss and mlvss table 8 parameters such as flux and turbidity were considered unrelated to lrvbio as these are membrane parameters and correlations were not attempted unsurprisingly mlss and mlvss featured a strong linear relationship as previously reported 21 and were very significantly correlated τ 0 86 p 0 001 in order of increasing strength ph temperature and hrt were positively correlated with lrvbio for all indicators τ 0 11 0 54 p 0 001 a pseudo first order nature of biological predation was reported previously to explain virus decay 12 14 the ability to model biological predation using pseudo first order kinetics would mean that a longer hrt should equate to an enhanced lrvbio which was observed in this study temperature may have been positively correlated due to a temperature dependence of the biological predation reaction rate do was negatively correlated for all indicators meaning that when over aeration i e do 95th ile 7 3 mg l 1 table 3 occurred lower lrvbio was observed τ 0 15 0 26 p 0 001 however no explanation for the relationship between high do and low lrvbio could be identified it is unlikely that the high do concentrations observed in this study would ever be consciously applied for the purposes of pathogen removal as denitrification would likely be impaired due to oxygen carryover and energy efficiency of the mbr would be sub optimal the high do concentrations observed along with the longer hrts srts and lower mlss and flux relative to typical design values section 3 1 further indicate that some of the installations sampled in this study were operating under design capacity unexpectedly srt was positively correlated with lrvbio for tc e coli and sc τ 0 15 0 32 p 0 001 and not correlated for frna and c perfringens it was previously thought that srt should correlate negatively with lrvbio as at longer srts greater accumulation of microorganisms should occur in the bioreactor assuming no biological predation van den akker et al 2014 this discrepancy may be due to the more dominant positive impact of hrt on biological predation than the possible negative impact from accumulation alternatively calculation of srt over the previous month may have been an inappropriate basis to adequately assess correlations and a longer period may have been necessary in order to approximate equilibrium conditions mlss was significantly negatively correlated with lrvbio for c perfringens e coli and sc τ 0 17 0 34 p 0 001 a stronger correlation with lrvbio existed for c perfringens and sc relative to e coli in addition c perfringens and sc activated sludge densities were positively correlated with mlss table 6 and both these organisms typically resist biological predation to a strong extent 16 van den akker et al 2014 which manifests as negative lrvbio values accordingly the mlss may be a more useful surrogate parameter when compared to srt for monitoring the potential for accumulation of organisms within the mbr 3 7 correlation of lrvmbr with operational parameters in general mbrs are validated as one unit operation to that end the factors already identified in previous sections to correlate with removal either across the membrane or within the activated sludge were assessed to identify if they were significant enough to influence overall removal raw values of flux and permeability were substituted with temperature corrected values given the improvement in correlation noted in table 5 turbidity was already reported in table 7 and is not repeated below for all other shortlisted factors τ correlation coefficients were reported between lrvmbr for each microorganism and operating parameters in table 9 temperature τ 0 26 0 34 p 0 001 hrt τ 0 11 0 31 p 0 01 and specific cst τ 0 16 0 50 p 0 001 were positively correlated with lrvmbr for all indicators as with lrvmem tc and e coli were negatively correlated with tmp τ 0 25 0 21 p 0 001 and positively correlated with permeability τ 0 25 0 19 p 0 001 interestingly sc followed the expected trend of a negative correlation with permeability although with a lower significance level of 0 01 τ 0 15 p 0 01 this may indicate that the improvement of lrv due to a reduction in permeability is more predictable for smaller often detected organisms such as sc than for larger organisms tc and e coli which should be removed by size exclusion regardless of fouling condition flux normalised for temperature was significantly negatively correlated with lrvmbr for both sc and c perfringens τ 0 31 0 39 p 0 001 for c perfringens e coli and tc ph displayed positive correlations τ 0 25 0 32 p 0 001 while do displayed negative correlations τ 0 24 0 34 p 0 001 following closely the trends identified for lrvbio the exception was sc which produced no correlation with either ph or do and lrvmbr for both c perfringens and sc negative correlations existed between lrvmbr and mlss τ 0 14 0 32 p 0 01 as sc and c perfringens resist bio predation they can accumulate in the bioreactor this tendency for accumulation was reflected by the significant positive correlation bioreactor density of sc and c perfringens with mlss concentration table 6 the end result would be for a higher mlss higher densities of sc and c perfringens would be expected in proximity to the membrane and for a constant lrvmem lrvmbr would appear lower which may explain the negative correlation of lrvmbr with mlss for these organisms srt was correlated positively similar to trends identified with lrvbio for both c perfringens and sc but not e coli or tc τ 0 14 0 26 p 0 01 in general parameters that correlated with lrvbio followed the same trends with lrvmbr indicating the importance of monitoring both the membrane and biological removal mechanisms 3 8 comparison of pathogen and indicator removal limited quantitative lrv have been reported for real pathogenic microorganisms alongside indicator microorganisms 15 to address this gap additional sampling was conducted at sites 3 and 9 to determine lrvbio and lrvmbr for cryptosporidium giardia adenovirus enterovirus and reovirus and to compare these with c perfringens as an indicator for protozoa and sc and frna as virus indicators fig 5 no viral pathogens were detected in any of the three 100 l permeate samples taken for each site and as a result lrvmbr for adenovirus enterovirus and reovirus remained higher than values of 4 0 3 3 and 3 3 respectively with any apparent removal variation due entirely to changing feed water densities of the pathogens lrvmbr for frna was equivalent for both sites based on observation of the paired samples taken with all values remaining higher than 3 3 and detectable permeate concentrations occurring at a feed water density sufficient to demonstrate and lrvmbr of 4 2 lrvmbr for sc ranged between 3 4 to 4 2 and 2 9 3 3 for sites 3 and 9 respectively indicating greater virus removal performance occurring at site 3 as a result of non detects for pathogenic viruses no specific virus could be identified as an ideal target pathogen and correlation of lrvmbr with operational parameters could not be made however for the samples taken lrvmbr for sc was demonstrated to be more conservative than for frna and the viral pathogens consistent with previous mbr studies 28 lrvbio determined at site 3 for adenovirus enterovirus and reovirus ranged between 0 to 1 4 0 7 to 1 4 and 0 3 to 1 3 respectively at site 9 lrvbio for adenovirus enterovirus and reovirus were between 0 0 to 0 9 0 3 to 1 1 and 0 3 to 0 7 respectively lrvbio results were largely inconclusive for site 3 with enterovirus and reovirus remaining undetected in the activated sludge and adenovirus only detected once in the four samples a higher rate of detection was noted in the activated sludge of site 9 with only one enterovirus density below the lod based on the results from site 9 the viruses were most to least conservatively removed in the biomass according to the order reovirus adenovirus and enterovirus lrvbio for sc was between 0 1 2 1 and 0 2 to 0 7 for sites 3 and 9 respectively while for frna lrvbio was between 0 8 1 5 for site 3 and 0 5 1 7 for site 9 the slightly enhanced biological removal performance at site 3 relative to site 9 concurred with the trends identified in section 3 5 indeed temperature hrt and srt were higher values in site 3 while mlss ph and do were equivalent for both sites table 10 to evaluate the suitability of c perfringens as an indicator for protozoa in mbr validation studies lrvmbr and lrvbio were determined and compared to cryptosporidium and giardia fig 6 lrvmbr for giardia cryptosporidium and c perfringens consistently exceeded 4 3 3 1 and 5 2 respectively at both sites neither giardia nor cryptosporidium was detected in any of the permeate samples analysed and c perfringens was only detected in one sample at site 9 when feed water densities were sufficient to demonstrate an lrvmbr of 5 3 giardia lrvbio at sites 3 and 9 were between 0 to 0 7 and 0 9 to 0 6 respectively c perfringens lrvbio was also higher at site 3 ranging from 1 4 to 0 8 when compared to site 9 where removal was between 1 7 to 1 4 cryptosporidium removal variability was higher at site 3 lrvbio 1 2 to 0 4 relative to site 9 lrvbio 0 2 to 0 4 and higher biological removal may have been favoured at site 9 regardless c perfringens was more conservatively removed than cryptosporidium in the activated sludge lrvmbr values were censored and no direct comparison of removal performance could be made to confirm the suitability of c perfringens as an indicator however given that c perfringens 0 6 1 0 μm diameter 27 is smaller than cryptosporidium and giardia 3 10 μm 1 it would be expected to present a greater challenge to removal by size exclusion by the membrane in addition it was demonstrated that c perfringens removal in the activated sludge was more conservative than both protozoa accordingly it can be said with reasonable certainty that c perfringens is a conservative indicator for protozoan removal in mbr 4 conclusions lrvmbr for virus indicators displayed limited sensitivity to pore size when results from membrane systems with pore sizes greater than 0 1 μm were excluded from the analysis of the overall data set this was demonstrated by the small increase of the 5th ile sc lrvmbr from 1 7 to 2 0 while frna lrvmbr remained unchanged the 5th ile lrvmbr for e coli increased marginally from 4 8 to 5 5 when limiting pore size to less than 0 1 μm of particular interest c perfringens the largest indicator organism which may accumulate in the reactor against the membrane exhibited the highest sensitivity to pore size with a 5th ile lrvmbr increase from 2 5 to 5 2 when excluding pore sizes greater than 0 1 μm as a result of comparison of a number of different full scale installations and the error inherent with microbiological analysis the correlation coefficients observed in this work were low which prevented development of simple model relationships to predict lrv nevertheless the correlations did appear to be of sufficient significance to indicate trends between operating parameters and lrv high values of lrvmbr were coincided with operation at lower flux tmp and mlss and higher operating values of ph temperature srt hrt and specific cst i e lower sludge filterability higher lrvmbr for virus indicators was favoured at lower permeability therefore test plans to determine worst case lrv for mbrs should be conducted under high flux with clean membranes low tmp at short srt and hrt and under the coldest expected operational conditions it was also demonstrated that doc removal could be monitored from the feed to activated sludge or feed to permeate and adequately correlate with biological removal performance of indicator organisms high permeate turbidity correlated well with lower lrvmbr supporting the use of turbidity as a monitoring technique real pathogenic viruses and protozoa were evaluated against indicator organisms adenovirus enterovirus reovirus giardia and cryptosporidium were removed to below their lod in the permeate for all samples and as a result no removal correlations could be developed however it was demonstrated that sc was more conservatively removed than the pathogenic viruses tested it was also demonstrated that c perfringens was more conservatively removed in the activated sludge than both giardia and cryptosporidium given that c perfringens has a smaller diameter than either protozoa its use as a conservative indicator is supported by this work the mbrs evaluated in this study appeared to have hrt and srt that were longer and mlss and flux on the lower range when compared to typical design parameters in addition most test sites were hollow fibre and pvdf was the most common membrane material further pathogen removal studies at full scale

13549,log removal values lrv for a range of pathogens in membrane bioreactors mbrs were aggregated for 180 sampling events across 11 municipal scale installations important correlations were

implications of this study provide important guidance for the validation of mbrs producing safe and consistent recycled water keywords lrv mbr validation protozoa virus bacteria cryptosporidium 1 introduction pathogenic microorganisms originating from sewage are the primary hazard in water recycling due to the potential for acute health effects from exposure to very low dosages 18 direct measurement of pathogenic species in wastewater is often not feasible due to low and highly variable concentrations and long turnaround time analysis procedures for which expertise is scarce 1 from an industry perspective extensive requirements to demonstrate pathogen removal have been recognised as a significant challenge that limits the feasibility of incorporating membrane bioreactors mbrs into water recycling schemes especially in the case of smaller utilities to develop more appropriate guidelines for validation of pathogen removal it is critical to quantify the impact of system design and operating conditions on the mbr performance 2 ideally influencing factors in the form of operational parameters could have defined limits set within which the trend of lrv is known and meets acceptable treatment targets these limits could constitute the safe operating envelope if maintained within the safe operating envelope an mbr would be expected to provide fit for purpose water with greater certainty a better understanding of factors influencing lrv would help to inform more rationalized test plans for permitting activities at full scale facilities ultimately leading to more economical and better understood results notwithstanding discrepancies in terminology used in the literature there are four primary mechanisms of removal within an mbr size exclusion by the membrane entrainment within the dynamic membrane fouling layer adsorption to activated sludge flocs and bio predation 3 no single mechanism can be defined as the sole contributor to rejection of pathogens through mbr the pathogen specific properties are expected to determine the dominant removal mechanism a number of operating factors have been identified to significantly influence pathogen removal in mbr including membrane pore size 4 hydraulic retention time hrt and resulting concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss 5 fouling membrane cleaning and ageing 6 7 and flux or transmembrane pressure tmp and permeability 8 a substantial amount of lrv data has been reported for mbrs recent reviews have summarized available virus removal data 9 investigated specific adsorption tendencies 10 11 and other removal mechanisms of pathogenic viruses 12 13 and proposed modelling approaches for virus lrv 14 in our recent review we identified that a majority of mbr lrv data points were reported without a complete or standardized set of key operational parameters or have been determined at lab or pilot scale resulting in uncertainty of full scale performance 15 additionally this statistical review clearly established that the correlation of operating parameters and pathogen removal performance was not yet possible with available reported data as a result identification of the significance and trends of influencing factors has not been possible with currently available data in addition limited studies 16 18 have quantified protozoa removal due to the perception that protozoa are larger than the mbr pore size and will be completely removed unfortunately without data to support protozoa removal it has been difficult to obtain regulatory approval for mbrs in potable recycling trains salveson et al 2021 this study includes analysis of a presumptive indicator microorganism for protozoa removal c perfringens as well as lrv results for cryptosporidium and giardia the protozoa of most concern in water recycling the aim of this study was to define an operating envelope for full scale mbrs by statistical assessment of a large body of paired lrv and operating parameters in addition surrogate measures for lrv of pathogens including indicator microorganism and physiochemical parameters such as dissolved organic carbon doc and turbidity were evaluated to inform their use as monitoring techniques for pathogen removal the source data for this study was collected over the course of 18 months during a rigorous sampling regime of 11 full scale mbrs from around australia during this sampling period over 180 site sampling visits were made and on each visit indicator lrv and operating parameters were recorded to the authors knowledge a sampling campaign of this magnitude covering multiple mbrs that aimed to collect pair and report operating and lrv data has not been attempted to date 2 method 2 1 data collection a total of 11 full scale mbrs were sampled during this study on each visit influent activated sludge and permeate were sampled and analysed for multiple parameters membrane parameters including configuration pore size material installed filtration area age from installation supplier and model are shown in table 1 a majority of installations studied utilized hollow fibre membranes 8 11 and the most common membrane material was polyvinylidenedifluoride pvdf 7 11 given the unequal sampling from different membrane configurations flat sheet vs hollow fibre and materials detailed analysis of these factors was not included to avoid analysis bias should further data be collected it may be of interest to ascertain if membrane material or configuration impacts lrv at scale however this would require similarly aged and operated installations at each site indicator microorganisms bulk parameters and operational data was collected and analysed a summary of samples parameters and analysis methods undertaken for each site visit is included in table 2 the full range of data paired based on sample day is provided as supplementary data 2 2 calculated parameters flux j was calculated by dividing total permeate flow rate to sample point recorded on scada by membrane area connected to sample point from site design information and is reported in units of l m 2 h 1 eq 1 1 j l m 2 h 1 p e r m e a t e f l o w r a t e l h 1 m e m b r a n e a r e a m 2 if multiple membrane trains were connected to a sample point and both trains were in operations then the average of flux calculated for each train was used trains that were not producing water but were connected to the sample point were not included in averaging calculations temperature correction of flux was achieved with eq 2 as reported in 21 2 j 20 l m 2 h 1 j t 1 03 20 t where j20 and jt are the flux corrected to 20 c and the operating flux at a bioreactor temperature of t c respectively eq 2 was chosen over the method listed in the membrane filtration guidance manual mfgm 22 for two reasons 1 eq 2 was empirically derived from activated sludge measurements and not based solely the relationship of pure water viscosity with temperature and 2 a method comparison demonstrated eq 2 was more sensitive to change in temperature than with the mfgm viscosity approach i e eq 2 varied flux more than the usepa method per degree change in temperature transmembrane pressure tmp is the difference between permeate and feed pressure across a membrane some sites calculated feed pressure based on hydraulic head from the membrane halfway point to the tank level the calculation method appeared subject to error in the form of negative tmp even when the pump withdraws permeate as a result a more robust method utilising installed site pressure transducers was used to ensure consistency between sites tmp was calculated with eq 3 by using the onsite pressure transducer installed between the membranes and the permeate pump eq 3 is valid provided membrane tank level and module height is constant which was the case for all sites 3 t m p k p a p j 0 p j where pj 0 and pj are the suction pressure readings in kpa observed on the pressure transducer between the membrane and permeate pump at 0 l m 2 h 1 i e when the pump is off and operating flux j respectively pj 0 is a site specific constant provided tank level and membrane position are constant permeability k was calculated by dividing flux by tmp eq 4 4 k l m 2 h 1 k p a 1 j l m 2 h 1 t m p k p a permeability normalised to 20 c k20 was calculated by substituting j20 the flux normalised to 20 c using eq 2 for j solid retention time srt was calculated on a monthly basis in order to allow for mbrs where intermittent sludge wasting was practiced a monthly basis was deemed appropriate as in most cases 1 month was greater than the operating srt and as a result the calculated value could be assumed close to equilibrium eq 5 5 s r t d v m 3 d a y s i n m o n t h d t o t a l m o n t h l y s l u d g e w a s t a g e m 3 where v was the total mbr operating volume including membrane tanks and biological zones hydraulic retention time hrt was calculated based on the previous 24 h flow taking into account for intermittent operation similar to srt eq 6 6 h r t h v m 3 24 h t o t a l d a i l y f l o w m 3 2 3 data analysis and correlation parameters were correlated using spss software v 23 ibm due to the high rate of censored data i e permeate readings less than the detection limit it was deemed inappropriate to use the typical pearson s r correlation statistic in place of pearson s r kendall s tau τ was used similar to pearson s r τ provides a statistic between 1 and 1 a value close to 1 or 1 indicating a good positive or negative correlation respectively τ is a non parametric correlation statistic that does not assume linearity but correlates based on rank order 23 24 if a positive τ close to 1 occurs when correlating variables a with b then low values of a occur paired with low values of b which implies a direct proportionality between a and b for a negative τ close to 1 low values of a occur paired with high values of b i e there is an inverse proportionality between a and b tied values i e if one variable remains constant until the variable for correlation reaches a certain limit will also result in a higher τ value the utility of τ incorporating tied values allows correlations of data sets that incorporate censored values below a detection limit as the level of detection lod acts as a tied value τ is therefore preferable to use of pearson s r as the values below the lod would either have to be omitted or changed possibly resulting in erroneous correlations 24 three different lrv values were calculated in order to differentiate between removal mechanisms 15 while lrvmbr eq 7 represented overall process removal by comparing influent and permeate microorganism densities lrvbio eq 8 considered influent and mixed liquor densities and is representative of removal due to biological predation only finally lrvmem eq 9 was calculated with mixed liquor and permeate densities and is representative of removal of microorganisms by the membrane and fouling layer given the nature of the sampling approach only the overall contributions of both the biological system and the membrane separation can be assessed as a result it was not possible to quantify some of the pathogen removal mechanisms such as adsorption on biological flocs deposition on the membrane surface known to occur in mbr 7 l r v m b r log 10 c i n c p e r m 8 l r v b i o log 10 c i n c m l 9 l r v m e m log 10 c m l c p e r m prior to correlation any reading that was below the lod was changed to the tied value of the lod for lrv values with censored permeate data the lod was used to calculate a conservative censored lrv the smallest lrv was then determined for each microorganism and used as a tied upper bound lrv value this was the lrv at which all removal performance below resulted in detection for 100 percent of observations all lrvs that were greater than the smallest lrv were then substituted for the tied value of the smallest lrv for example the smallest censored lrvmbr for e coli was 6 3 this means that for a lrvmbr less than 6 3 e coli was always detected all e coli lrvmbr that were greater than 6 3 were substituted for 6 3 prior to correlation and determination of τ correlation significance was assessed at three levels using the p value p from a two tailed test a significant correlation was defined as having a p less than 0 01 and a very significant correlation defined as having a p of less than 0 001 in this study a p value greater than 0 05 was defined as a cut off indicating that two variables were not significantly correlated 2 4 assessment of the impact of pore size only three different nominal membrane product pore sizes 0 04 0 1 and 0 4 μm were reported across all investigated sites a majority of sites investigated utilised membranes with reported nominal pore size of 0 04 μm with the exception of site 1 and site 7 where pore sizes were 0 4 and 0 05 μm respectively given the importance of size exclusion as a mechanism in pathogen reduction by mbr it was deemed necessary to assess the impact of pore size however as the data set was heavily biased towards pore sizes of 0 04 μm and featured a limited range of only 3 different pore sizes it was considered inappropriate to perform correlations instead the lrvmbr distributions calculated as probability density functions pdfs as described in 15 were compared for the master data set and for the data set comprising only those sites with reported pore size of 0 1 μm 2 5 pathogen analysis samples were taken for analysis of giardia cryptosporidium enteroviruses adenoviruses and reoviruses on 8 occasions across sites 3 and 9 samples were transported to sydney water corporations west ryde laboratories swc on the day of sampling in a cooler containing ice blocks for each of the two sites 2 1 l samples of influent and activated sludge were taken on 4 occasions and 2 100 l of permeate on three occasions for analysis of protozoa and viruses swc utilised an in house national association of testing authorities nata accredited method for analysis of giardia and cryptosporidium based on 25 dapi staining was used for confirmation of cysts and oocysts prior to analysis permeate samples were concentrated by swc using ultrafiltration uf results reported in this document are corrected for recovery and refer to dapi positive dapi cyst or oocyst counts giardia and cryptosporidium were not detected in any of the six 100 l permeate samples taken lrv was calculated for same day samples using the limit of detection lod 1 dapi org 100 l adjusted for the worst recovery as a result reported lrvs for protozoa are conservative for virus analysis an in house nata accredited tissue culture method for analysis of enteroviruses adenoviruses and reoviruses to yield most probable number mpn influent and activated sludge samples were concentrated via peg precipitation prior to analysis 100 l permeate samples were concentrated using uf similar methods to those used by swc have been reported previously 26 adenovirus enteroviruses and reoviruses were not detected in any of the six 100 l permeate samples taken lrv was calculated for same day samples using the limit of detection lod 1 mpn 100 l for enteroviruses and adenoviruses and 3 6 mpn 100 l for reoviruses as a result reported lrvs for viruses are conservative 3 results and discussion 3 1 establishment of an operating envelope the operating data collected alongside lrvs during the sampling campaign is summarised in table 3 in order to summarise the range and any skewness of operating parameters the 5th and 95th percentile ile interquartile range 25th and 75th ile average and median values are reported due to data recording failures and installation differences between sites some operating parameters were not available data set completeness e g number of values of total possible was also reported to express any absence of paired operating parameters the impact of pore size on lrv was assessed and a subset of data was created the operating envelope corresponding to mbrs where reported nominal pore size was below 0 1 μm is summarised in table 4 the range of lrvs and correlations presented in the following sections is considered valid within the range of operating conditions listed in table 4 in general mbrs would be designed to remove nutrients under the most economically viable configuration to achieve this a minimum srt and hrt would be defined such that nitrification and denitrification would reliably occur a design flux would be defined to deal with average dry weather flows and a maximum flux to manage wet weather events typical mbr pilot demonstration parameters reported previously were 10 40 d srt 5 12 h hrt and fluxes from 25 40 l m 2 h 1 21 the intent of the sampling campaign in this study was to quantify the lrv of mbrs under normal operation it is of note that the srts and hrts of the installations studied were higher and the flux was typically lower than those reported in previous demonstrations the lower flux and longer hrt and srt is symptomatic of some of the mbrs being oversized relative to operating requirements during the sampling campaign another symptom of the mbrs in this study being oversized is that mlss is generally on the lower end when compared to pilot demonstrations that targeted bioreactor mlss levels of 8 14 g l 1 21 to that end care should be taken extrapolating the lrv results contained herein outside the ranges proposed in tables 3 and 4 3 2 impact of nominal pore size on lrv the pdfs of the lrvmbr are shown for c perfringens e coli sc and frna in figs 1 4 respectively for the master data set of c perfringens the lrvmbr pdf featured a high standard deviation this was likely a result c perfringens accumulation within the bioreactor increase by 1 4 log indicating that if breakthrough occurred a higher permeate density would be observed the subset for membranes installed with a nominal pore size of less than 0 1 μm exhibited a much lower standard deviation with a 5th ile of 5 2 almost double that for the master data set 5th ile lrv for all c perfringens was 2 5 fig 1 a mean and standard deviation lrvmbr for c perfringens of 4 9 and 0 82 respectively was reported for a full scale mbr in a previous study van den akker et al 2014 along with lrvmbr of 3 9 5 0 reported in a separate study 16 both these observations fall within the range of values observed in this work it is possible that membranes reported as having a nominal pore size of 0 4 μm may feature a small number of macropores larger than c perfringens 0 6 1 0 μm 27 which may allow passage of c perfringens when nominal pore size is reduced to less than 0 1 μm it is suggested that the number of macropores big enough to allow transport of c perfringens also decreases resulting in a higher and less variable lrvmbr the 5th ile e coli lrvmbr was 4 8 for the total data set and 5 5 for membranes with pore sizes of 0 1 μm indicating significant overall removal the higher removal of e coli when compared to c perfringens was likely due to the contribution of the bioreactor lrvbio to lrvmbr which reduced e coli densities by 0 9 log from influent to activated sludge fig 2 interestingly the median value 7 1 was identical for both data sets which may imply that the smaller pore size reduced removal variability without shifting performance to appreciably higher values in other work mean e coli lrvmbr has been reported between 5 and 7 16 and separately with a mean 5 0 and standard deviation of 0 7 van den akker et al 2014 in general agreement with the results of this work our own separate analysis indicated a 5th percentile lrvmbr of 3 8 which extends to below the values observed in our analysis 15 sc lrvmbr 5th iles were 1 7 and 2 0 for the total data set and 0 1 μm subset respectively prior reviews have reported sc lrvmbr between 2 7 and 5 3 from a number of sources 9 the 5th and 95th percentile in this study was 1 7 5 7 which corresponds closely with this range but does extend to lower values in a previous review using similar monte carlo lrv calculation techniques in this work a 5th percentile sc lrvmbr from a range of literature data was 1 1 15 similarly frna exhibited little change when observing the subset of smaller pore sizes with 5th ile lrvs of 3 4 and 3 5 removal of frna has been reported in recent reviews between 3 5 and 7 1 9 and in our previous analysis of other literature a 5th percentile of 2 7 was calculated 15 in general agreement with this study even though wild sc can exhibit much larger variation in size than frna 4 it would appear this is not a primary factor governing the observed removal rather the resistance of sc to biological treatment resulted in a greater density against the membrane leading to a higher rate of detection in the permeate with 72 of permeate samples above the lod by contrast frna bacteriophage median lrvbio was 1 2 log units and was only detected in 20 of permeate samples figs 3 and 4 unfortunately the assays used do not identify specific species of frna or sc that might be present as such as mechanistic discussion of the potential impact of iso electric point or relative virus indicator size cannot be used to explain results frna lrvmbr of between 4 6 and 6 were observed alongside sc lrvmbr of 2 7 4 0 by a mbr equipped with a 0 4 μm membrane in a previous study 28 the observation of more conservative removal of sc relative to frna was in agreement with the results of this work 3 3 correlation of lrvmem with operating parameters common membrane specific operating parameters including tmp flux and permeability were shortlisted for correlation with lrvmem in addition specific cst i e cst divided by mlss to summarise sludge filterability was also compared finally lrvmem correlations were assessed against temperature directly and also flux and permeability normalised for temperature eqs 1 2 and 4 the correlation of turbidity with indicators is reported in table 6 and with lrvmem and lrvmbr in table 7 τ values for lrvmem c perfringens tc e coli and sc are included in table 5 sc lrvmem could not be significantly correlated with any of the shortlisted parameters flux was negatively correlated with lrvmem for c perfringens τ 0 29 p 0 001 but not with any other organism tested tmp was negatively correlated with both tc and e coli lrvmem τ 0 18 0 23 p 0 001 permeability was positively correlated with tc and e coli implying that a more fouled membrane exhibited a lower lrvmem τ 0 19 0 25 p 0 001 in a previous study lower rejection of antibiotic resistant bacteria was observed at a higher tmp which then stabilized at even higher tmps when membranes were irrecoverably fouled in agreement with the observations made in this work 29 the negative permeability to lrvmem correlation may have occurred due to the independence of flux on e coli and tc meaning that an inverse of the already negatively correlated tmp would yield a positive correlation this is further supported by the similarity in the magnitude of τ values for e coli and tc noted for permeability and tmp it should be noted that 5th and 95th percentile values of lrvmem for e coli and tc were 4 5 to 6 3 and 4 3 to 7 2 respectively see supplementary information for transformed tc and ec lrvmem the high 5th percentile indicates that there is significant benefit with bacterial removal by the membrane regardless of tmp and permeability and that these trends were only observed for already to high lrvs 4 unfortunately lrvmem as measured accounts for both the impact of size exclusion of the intact membrane and fouling on lrv which means that exact contributions of fouling to lrv are not able to be elucidated in this study normalisation of flux and permeability for temperature identified the same trends as un normalised parameters and resulted in the same or a slightly increased correlation coefficient when compared with the raw values i e the τ values between c perfringens lrvmem and j and j20 were 0 29 and 0 34 respectively therefore it may be advisable that when reporting of challenge test data normalisation of flux and permeability to a reference temperature should be carried out specific cst correlated significantly and positively indicating that higher lrvmem is expected for poorly filterable sludge τ 0 16 0 51 p 0 001 the much higher correlation coefficient for c perfringens τ 0 51 compared to e coli and tc τ 0 16 0 17 may be due to the strong correlation of activated sludge c perfringens densities and mlss concentration table 6 3 4 correlation of indicator concentrations in order to evaluate the necessity for measurement of multiple indicators an initial correlation was performed to assess occurrence of different indicator microorganisms at the same sample location i e c perfringens influent densities were compared to those of e coli and also to compare the densities of the same indicator throughout the process i e c perfringens densities were compared in the influent and activated sludge non microbial surrogates including doc measurements mlss and permeate turbidity were also correlated with indicator microorganism densities from the same sampling location table 6 in general indicator microorganisms were weakly but significantly correlated to each other in the influent wastewater τ 0 11 0 32 p 0 001 with the exception being tc and c perfringens and frna and sc for which no correlation could be found between these two organisms pairs activated sludge densities of all indicators correlated well τ 0 11 0 42 p 0 001 with the exception of frna which did not correlate with either c perfringens or sc in this work and in previously reported literature 16 both c perfringens and sc have displayed tendencies to accumulate within the bioreactor i e lrvbio 0 whereas frna is typically removed to a significant extent within the activated sludge the disparate actions of biological removal mechanisms on frna as opposed to c perfringens and sc may have led to the absence of any correlation correlation of permeate frna was problematic as only 24 of readings were detected and only 10 of readings were above the detection limit no significant correlation could be found between permeate frna and any other indicator a weak negative correlation τ 0 17 p 0 01 existed between permeate c perfringens and frna correlations for c perfringens permeate were also uncertain as only 26 of measurements were at or above the detection limit the combination of low detection rate on both c perfringens and frna means that there is greater uncertainty in any correlation between the two as such the negative correlation may be meaningless with the exception of frna all indicators displayed significant positive correlations with turbidity in the permeate τ 0 18 0 36 p 0 001 supporting the use of turbidity as monitoring technique in mbr correlations between the same indicator in the influent and activated sludge were positive and significant τ 0 19 0 47 p 0 001 influent and permeate densities were only significantly correlated for the smaller virus indicators frna and sc τ 0 24 and 0 50 p 0 001 whereas for the larger bacteria and protozoan indicators c perfringens e coli and tc correlations were either slightly significant e g tc τ 0 12 p 0 01 or not correlated it was previously suggested that the independence of influent and permeate densities indicated by a null correlation as seen in table 6 was a result of significant removal by size exclusion with the exception of infrequent and random detections likely caused by disturbances to the fouling layer sporadically un shielding potential membrane defects 30 3 5 correlation of indicator reduction in order to identify similarities in fate and removal of different indicators and surrogate measures lrvmbr lrvbio and lrvmem were compared for microorganism indicators doc removal calculated as an lrv i e log10 docin docout and permeate turbidity table 7 as mentioned in section 2 3 the minimum censored lrv value was determined and substituted for all higher lrvs to allow correlation without omission of data unfortunately the lowest censored lrvmbr and lrvmem for frna were 2 0 and 1 0 respectively and there were less than 3 lrv lower than these values as a result correlations for frna were not possible apart from for lrvbio lrvbio correlated positively and significantly between all microorganism indicators and lrvdoc τ 0 21 0 40 p 0 001 indicating the potential for development of a doc monitoring protocol to allow for biological removal to be considered a critical control point lrvbio and lrvmbr for lrvdoc were strongly and significantly correlated τ 0 63 p 0 001 this is advantageous as if control point monitoring correlations were to be developed between biological removal of pathogens and lrvdoc the mbr permeate is a less harsh monitoring environment when compared to the activated sludge lrvmem correlated positively and significantly between organisms larger than the membrane pore size tc e coli and c perfringens τ 0 36 0 61 p 0 001 likely due to size exclusion being the predominant mechanism of removal for these indicators in addition permeate turbidity was significantly negatively correlated with lrvmem of e coli tc and c perfringens indicating higher removals across the membrane at lower turbidities τ 0 19 0 32 p 0 01 by contrast lrvmem for sc was not significantly correlated with any other indicator or parameter lrvmbr correlated positively and significantly for all indicator microorganisms and lrvdoc τ 0 18 0 62 p 0 001 lrvmbr correlated negatively with permeate turbidity for all indicators including sc τ 0 17 0 29 p 0 01 3 6 correlation of lrvbio with operating parameters operating parameters that were perceived to have a possible effect on lrvbio included bioreactor ph aerobic zone do temperature srt hrt mlss and mlvss table 8 parameters such as flux and turbidity were considered unrelated to lrvbio as these are membrane parameters and correlations were not attempted unsurprisingly mlss and mlvss featured a strong linear relationship as previously reported 21 and were very significantly correlated τ 0 86 p 0 001 in order of increasing strength ph temperature and hrt were positively correlated with lrvbio for all indicators τ 0 11 0 54 p 0 001 a pseudo first order nature of biological predation was reported previously to explain virus decay 12 14 the ability to model biological predation using pseudo first order kinetics would mean that a longer hrt should equate to an enhanced lrvbio which was observed in this study temperature may have been positively correlated due to a temperature dependence of the biological predation reaction rate do was negatively correlated for all indicators meaning that when over aeration i e do 95th ile 7 3 mg l 1 table 3 occurred lower lrvbio was observed τ 0 15 0 26 p 0 001 however no explanation for the relationship between high do and low lrvbio could be identified it is unlikely that the high do concentrations observed in this study would ever be consciously applied for the purposes of pathogen removal as denitrification would likely be impaired due to oxygen carryover and energy efficiency of the mbr would be sub optimal the high do concentrations observed along with the longer hrts srts and lower mlss and flux relative to typical design values section 3 1 further indicate that some of the installations sampled in this study were operating under design capacity unexpectedly srt was positively correlated with lrvbio for tc e coli and sc τ 0 15 0 32 p 0 001 and not correlated for frna and c perfringens it was previously thought that srt should correlate negatively with lrvbio as at longer srts greater accumulation of microorganisms should occur in the bioreactor assuming no biological predation van den akker et al 2014 this discrepancy may be due to the more dominant positive impact of hrt on biological predation than the possible negative impact from accumulation alternatively calculation of srt over the previous month may have been an inappropriate basis to adequately assess correlations and a longer period may have been necessary in order to approximate equilibrium conditions mlss was significantly negatively correlated with lrvbio for c perfringens e coli and sc τ 0 17 0 34 p 0 001 a stronger correlation with lrvbio existed for c perfringens and sc relative to e coli in addition c perfringens and sc activated sludge densities were positively correlated with mlss table 6 and both these organisms typically resist biological predation to a strong extent 16 van den akker et al 2014 which manifests as negative lrvbio values accordingly the mlss may be a more useful surrogate parameter when compared to srt for monitoring the potential for accumulation of organisms within the mbr 3 7 correlation of lrvmbr with operational parameters in general mbrs are validated as one unit operation to that end the factors already identified in previous sections to correlate with removal either across the membrane or within the activated sludge were assessed to identify if they were significant enough to influence overall removal raw values of flux and permeability were substituted with temperature corrected values given the improvement in correlation noted in table 5 turbidity was already reported in table 7 and is not repeated below for all other shortlisted factors τ correlation coefficients were reported between lrvmbr for each microorganism and operating parameters in table 9 temperature τ 0 26 0 34 p 0 001 hrt τ 0 11 0 31 p 0 01 and specific cst τ 0 16 0 50 p 0 001 were positively correlated with lrvmbr for all indicators as with lrvmem tc and e coli were negatively correlated with tmp τ 0 25 0 21 p 0 001 and positively correlated with permeability τ 0 25 0 19 p 0 001 interestingly sc followed the expected trend of a negative correlation with permeability although with a lower significance level of 0 01 τ 0 15 p 0 01 this may indicate that the improvement of lrv due to a reduction in permeability is more predictable for smaller often detected organisms such as sc than for larger organisms tc and e coli which should be removed by size exclusion regardless of fouling condition flux normalised for temperature was significantly negatively correlated with lrvmbr for both sc and c perfringens τ 0 31 0 39 p 0 001 for c perfringens e coli and tc ph displayed positive correlations τ 0 25 0 32 p 0 001 while do displayed negative correlations τ 0 24 0 34 p 0 001 following closely the trends identified for lrvbio the exception was sc which produced no correlation with either ph or do and lrvmbr for both c perfringens and sc negative correlations existed between lrvmbr and mlss τ 0 14 0 32 p 0 01 as sc and c perfringens resist bio predation they can accumulate in the bioreactor this tendency for accumulation was reflected by the significant positive correlation bioreactor density of sc and c perfringens with mlss concentration table 6 the end result would be for a higher mlss higher densities of sc and c perfringens would be expected in proximity to the membrane and for a constant lrvmem lrvmbr would appear lower which may explain the negative correlation of lrvmbr with mlss for these organisms srt was correlated positively similar to trends identified with lrvbio for both c perfringens and sc but not e coli or tc τ 0 14 0 26 p 0 01 in general parameters that correlated with lrvbio followed the same trends with lrvmbr indicating the importance of monitoring both the membrane and biological removal mechanisms 3 8 comparison of pathogen and indicator removal limited quantitative lrv have been reported for real pathogenic microorganisms alongside indicator microorganisms 15 to address this gap additional sampling was conducted at sites 3 and 9 to determine lrvbio and lrvmbr for cryptosporidium giardia adenovirus enterovirus and reovirus and to compare these with c perfringens as an indicator for protozoa and sc and frna as virus indicators fig 5 no viral pathogens were detected in any of the three 100 l permeate samples taken for each site and as a result lrvmbr for adenovirus enterovirus and reovirus remained higher than values of 4 0 3 3 and 3 3 respectively with any apparent removal variation due entirely to changing feed water densities of the pathogens lrvmbr for frna was equivalent for both sites based on observation of the paired samples taken with all values remaining higher than 3 3 and detectable permeate concentrations occurring at a feed water density sufficient to demonstrate and lrvmbr of 4 2 lrvmbr for sc ranged between 3 4 to 4 2 and 2 9 3 3 for sites 3 and 9 respectively indicating greater virus removal performance occurring at site 3 as a result of non detects for pathogenic viruses no specific virus could be identified as an ideal target pathogen and correlation of lrvmbr with operational parameters could not be made however for the samples taken lrvmbr for sc was demonstrated to be more conservative than for frna and the viral pathogens consistent with previous mbr studies 28 lrvbio determined at site 3 for adenovirus enterovirus and reovirus ranged between 0 to 1 4 0 7 to 1 4 and 0 3 to 1 3 respectively at site 9 lrvbio for adenovirus enterovirus and reovirus were between 0 0 to 0 9 0 3 to 1 1 and 0 3 to 0 7 respectively lrvbio results were largely inconclusive for site 3 with enterovirus and reovirus remaining undetected in the activated sludge and adenovirus only detected once in the four samples a higher rate of detection was noted in the activated sludge of site 9 with only one enterovirus density below the lod based on the results from site 9 the viruses were most to least conservatively removed in the biomass according to the order reovirus adenovirus and enterovirus lrvbio for sc was between 0 1 2 1 and 0 2 to 0 7 for sites 3 and 9 respectively while for frna lrvbio was between 0 8 1 5 for site 3 and 0 5 1 7 for site 9 the slightly enhanced biological removal performance at site 3 relative to site 9 concurred with the trends identified in section 3 5 indeed temperature hrt and srt were higher values in site 3 while mlss ph and do were equivalent for both sites table 10 to evaluate the suitability of c perfringens as an indicator for protozoa in mbr validation studies lrvmbr and lrvbio were determined and compared to cryptosporidium and giardia fig 6 lrvmbr for giardia cryptosporidium and c perfringens consistently exceeded 4 3 3 1 and 5 2 respectively at both sites neither giardia nor cryptosporidium was detected in any of the permeate samples analysed and c perfringens was only detected in one sample at site 9 when feed water densities were sufficient to demonstrate an lrvmbr of 5 3 giardia lrvbio at sites 3 and 9 were between 0 to 0 7 and 0 9 to 0 6 respectively c perfringens lrvbio was also higher at site 3 ranging from 1 4 to 0 8 when compared to site 9 where removal was between 1 7 to 1 4 cryptosporidium removal variability was higher at site 3 lrvbio 1 2 to 0 4 relative to site 9 lrvbio 0 2 to 0 4 and higher biological removal may have been favoured at site 9 regardless c perfringens was more conservatively removed than cryptosporidium in the activated sludge lrvmbr values were censored and no direct comparison of removal performance could be made to confirm the suitability of c perfringens as an indicator however given that c perfringens 0 6 1 0 μm diameter 27 is smaller than cryptosporidium and giardia 3 10 μm 1 it would be expected to present a greater challenge to removal by size exclusion by the membrane in addition it was demonstrated that c perfringens removal in the activated sludge was more conservative than both protozoa accordingly it can be said with reasonable certainty that c perfringens is a conservative indicator for protozoan removal in mbr 4 conclusions lrvmbr for virus indicators displayed limited sensitivity to pore size when results from membrane systems with pore sizes greater than 0 1 μm were excluded from the analysis of the overall data set this was demonstrated by the small increase of the 5th ile sc lrvmbr from 1 7 to 2 0 while frna lrvmbr remained unchanged the 5th ile lrvmbr for e coli increased marginally from 4 8 to 5 5 when limiting pore size to less than 0 1 μm of particular interest c perfringens the largest indicator organism which may accumulate in the reactor against the membrane exhibited the highest sensitivity to pore size with a 5th ile lrvmbr increase from 2 5 to 5 2 when excluding pore sizes greater than 0 1 μm as a result of comparison of a number of different full scale installations and the error inherent with microbiological analysis the correlation coefficients observed in this work were low which prevented development of simple model relationships to predict lrv nevertheless the correlations did appear to be of sufficient significance to indicate trends between operating parameters and lrv high values of lrvmbr were coincided with operation at lower flux tmp and mlss and higher operating values of ph temperature srt hrt and specific cst i e lower sludge filterability higher lrvmbr for virus indicators was favoured at lower permeability therefore test plans to determine worst case lrv for mbrs should be conducted under high flux with clean membranes low tmp at short srt and hrt and under the coldest expected operational conditions it was also demonstrated that doc removal could be monitored from the feed to activated sludge or feed to permeate and adequately correlate with biological removal performance of indicator organisms high permeate turbidity correlated well with lower lrvmbr supporting the use of turbidity as a monitoring technique real pathogenic viruses and protozoa were evaluated against indicator organisms adenovirus enterovirus reovirus giardia and cryptosporidium were removed to below their lod in the permeate for all samples and as a result no removal correlations could be developed however it was demonstrated that sc was more conservatively removed than the pathogenic viruses tested it was also demonstrated that c perfringens was more conservatively removed in the activated sludge than both giardia and cryptosporidium given that c perfringens has a smaller diameter than either protozoa its use as a conservative indicator is supported by this work the mbrs evaluated in this study appeared to have hrt and srt that were longer and mlss and flux on the lower range when compared to typical design parameters in addition most test sites were hollow fibre and pvdf was the most common membrane material further pathogen removal studies at full scale installations would be beneficial to better understand the impact of hrt srt flux mlss membrane configuration and material on lrv declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations
