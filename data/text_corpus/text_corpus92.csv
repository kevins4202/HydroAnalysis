460,hyporheic exchange is affected by bedform geometry which induces complex flow paths within the bedform additional factors that influence flow and solute transport in the hyporheic zone are layered profile sediments and density driven flow this study explored the combined effects of these factors on hyporheic exchange through laboratory experiments and numerical simulations involving infiltrating solute displacing less dense resident water in a layered bedform with a low permeability layer lpl the bedform consisted of three horizontal layers in which the hydraulic conductivity of the middle layer lpl was less than that of the top tl and bottom layers bl the results demonstrated that a previously unexplored combination of mechanisms density effects and layered bedform produces irregular spatial patterns of solute transport in the hyporheic zone for instance the width of solute plume within the bottom layers becomes narrowed compared with tracer transport with increasing density contrast between infiltrating solute and resident water the solute plume becomes much narrower forming fingers numerical modeling further shows that the hydraulic conductivity contrast hcc and relative thickness rt of the hyporheic zone layers also affect the spatial solute transport patterns as the hydraulic conductivity contrast or relative thickness increases the plume becomes much narrower horizontal ambient flow haf dominated in the bottom layers and lateral solute spreading and mixing intensified with a higher hydraulic conductivity contrast and relative thickness furthermore the vertical solute plume was detached by the horizontal ambient flow in the bottom layers with a discontinuous low permeability layer forming a discontinuous zone of vertical solute transport

but also control the exchange of water and solutes across the sediment water interface swi elliott a and brooks 1997 packman a and mackay 2003 hyporheic exchange in which water and solutes enter the streambed and are transported within it for different paths before returning to the stream occurs over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales cardenas m 2008 stonedahl s et al 2010 this process affects the fate and transport characteristics of different solutes within streambed packman a et al 2000 ren and packman 2004 ecosystem services in relation to nutrient cycling zarnetske et al 2012 trauth et al 2014 and carbon fluxes battin t et al 2008 findlay et al 1993 the resulting area of this exchange within the streambed known as the hyporheic zone hz is thus a key element of stream ecological functioning harvey j and gooseff 2015 boulton a et al 1998 and has a substantial impact on water quality of fluvial ecosystems hancock p et al 2005 findlay 1995 lewandowski et al 2019 knowledge of the drivers e g streambed topography turbulence wave pumping buoyancy forces of hyporheic exchange is essential for understanding solute transport characteristics within the streambed streambed topography as a major driver of hyporheic exchange can range from small bedforms e g ripples dunes cardenas m and wilson j 2007 that scale with the stream depth to larger geomorphologic features that scale with the stream width e g bars riffles tonina and buffington j 2007 tonina and buffington j 2011 these features affect hydraulic head gradients along the swi which drive hyporheic flow circulation of different lateral extents and penetration depths many experimental and numerical modelling studies investigated the effects of streambed topography on the swi exchange flux and solute transport characteristics within the hz ren and packman 2004 cardenas m and wilson j 2007 packman a et al 2000 boano et al 2007 fox et al 2014 generally the streambed morphology significantly affects solute residence times and flow paths within the hz due to surface subsurface interactions under different surface flow regimes cardenas m and wilson j 2007 boano et al 2013 despite the considerable research on streambed topography induced hyporheic exchange sediment heterogeneity a common feature of streambeds is usually neglected packman a et al 2000 boano et al 2007 fox et al 2014 cardenas m and wilson j 2006 indeed streambeds in natural rivers can often be spatially structured with permeability contrasts of 2 5 orders of magnitude between different zones kennedy c et al 2009 this variability can induce solute fluxes that are different to those under homogenous sediment conditions cardenas m et al 2004 laboratory experiments and simulations that investigated effects of streambed heterogeneity on hyporheic exchange due to the random permeability field distributions demonstrated the potential irregular spatial extent of the hz and associated spatially variable interfacial fluxes fox et al 2016 salehin et al 2004 another typical type of the heterogeneous structure is the layered streambed with a low permeability layer lpl which results from episodic deposition processes such as in the huaihe river one of the major rivers in china figure s1 and other lowland rivers angermann et al 2012 krause et al 2014 sebok et al 2015 a lpl was sampled in streambed cores from the huaihe river these cores exhibit layering and a corresponding vertical heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity sebok et al 2015 an overall aim of this work is to determine the effect of layered streambed profiles on hz flow and transport motivated by the abovementioned field observations we considered a three layered streambed profile with the middle lpl layer having a relatively low hydraulic conductivity it is known that the presence of an lpl can lead to flow confinement in combination with regional groundwater upwelling gomez velez j et al 2014 in addition to spatially varying sediment properties the stream water composition and hence density can also vary there has been increased salinization of stream water over decades due to the use of road salt deicers and wastewater discharges chen et al 2014 schaper j et al 2019 wagner döbler et al 2000 kaushal s et al 2005 the short term conductivity fluctuations and hence increasing salinity of stream water is sufficient to induce density variations in the hz flow patterns when both free i e gravity driven transport and forced convection i e hydraulically driven transport operate simultaneously to drive exchange of river water across the swi the resulting mixed convective flow can considerably affect solute spreading and mixing within streambeds konikow l et al 2013 for example the experimental study of boano et al 2009 demonstrated that density contrasts drive hyporheic exchange across a flat streambed jin et al 2011 2015 found that density induced convection is more likely to dominate in deep hyporheic regions within dunes and can inhibit solute release from sediment to stream water although previous studies revealed how streambed heterogeneity and density contrasts impact hyporheic exchange these factors were considered in isolation using laboratory experiments and numerical modeling this study aims to elucidate the effects of solute induced density contrasts on flow and transport within a three layered bedform as motivated by field observations from the huaihe river figure s1 the experimental data are examined in conjunction with numerical simulation results focusing on i the different transport characteristics for conservative solute transport within bedforms under the combined effects of density variations and layered streambeds ii the mechanisms that control irregular and unstable transport within the hz and iii the effects of density gradients hcc rt and discontinuous lpl on hz flow and solute transport patterns 2 methodologies 2 1 experimental setup and measurements experiments were carried out in a recirculating tilting flume consisting of a 3 45 m long 0 1 m wide and 0 7 m deep rectangular channel fig 1 a the front side of the flume was made of perspex to visualize the sand geometry and tracer transport within the bedform two vertical arrays of micro ports for pore water sampling were located at unequal intervals on the stoss and lee sides of the fourth bedform fig 1b stream water was continuously recirculated from the storage tank located below the flume channel the discharge was controlled by a valve and measured with an electromagnetic flow meter similar to previous flume experiments jin et al 2010 a perforated pvc plate and a curved plastic box 30 cm length and a maximum height of 30 cm were installed in the inlet section to dissipate energy and reduce flow turbulence respectively a fixed streambed geometry was used fig 1b the bedform shape was triangular with dimensions 0 35 m long 0 30 m deep and 0 025 m high table 1 at the downstream end of the channel a water pervious perforated perspex sheet covered by a fine mesh was used to hold the sediment in place and an adjustable height discharge gate was installed in the outlet section to keep the same stream water depth on all bedforms solute transport within the bedform was investigated by introducing a non reactive conservative dye fd c red 40 roha dyechem ltd no effect on fluid density and a salt solution into the recirculating water in the storage tank when the tracer solution flowed over the fixed periodic streambed through the pipe the electrical conductivity ec was measured with a conductivity meter dds 11a sensor shanghai precision and scientific instrument company in the first 20 min after the commencement of the experiment the stream tracer concentration was measured at different positions i e inlet middle and outlet of the flume channel to calculate the average concentration the stream tracer concentration was thereafter measured at the end of the flume fig 1a for the duration of the experiment the solute plume within the streambed was monitored using high resolution digital images recorded every 1 min for 24 h through the flume glass wall at the middle of the flume a total of 4 dunes out of 9 were captured by the images additionally a 100 µl syringe was used to collect pore water samples through silica rubber septa located in sampling ports on the rear of the flume the time interval of pore water sampling was 25 min at the beginning of the experiment to capture the relatively rapid concentration change as the solute was transferred into the bed as the experiment continued the concentration change became gradual after the passage of the local solute front thus the sampling time interval was increased to hours towards to the end of the experiment 2 2 preparation of layered streambed and experimental procedure two kinds of uniform artificial sands nanjing ninglei sand and stone factory were used for the layered streambed the median grain size was 0 37 mm for the coarse sand and 0 21 mm for the fine sand the sands were washed with deionized water in a cylindrical circulation device then added to the flume jin et al 2010 the bulk porosity of sands which was measured using the imbibition method collins r 1976 was 0 46 for the coarse sand θ 1 and 0 47 for the fine sand θ 2 the saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using a column subjected to a constant head drop with values of 5 5 10 3 and 6 6 10 4 m s 1 for the coarse k 1 and fine sand k 2 respectively table 1 before the experiment started we first drew 10 dots in the perspex on the front side of the flume and connected them with a mark pen the thickness d 1mm two horizonal lines i e the interface between low permeability layer and top layer low permeability layer and bottom layer were formed to ensure a straight line between these points the elevation of the first and last point was less than 1 mm with the help of spirit level i e the angle of inclination for the horizontal line of 9 bedforms θ arctan 0 1 35 9 0 018 the bottom layer was constructed by depositing coarse sand through the stream water column along the horizontal line for the surface of the bottom layer we kept all coarse sands in the thickness of the horizontal line the surface was then flatted using a triangular perforated plastic template above the bottom layer the fine sand was added to build the low permeability layer resulting in the layout shown in fig 1b i e a 0 2 m layer of the coarse sand at the bottom of the flume overlain by a 0 05 m lpl above the lpl the coarse sand was added to build the top layer the bedform surface was formed using a triangular perforated plastic template after the bedforms were completed the water flow in the flume commenced with a flow rate with 0 13 m s 1 for 0 5 h to establish a quasi steady flow condition for the given flume slope of 0 0003 with the initial condition established the contents of the storage tank were then switched to solute to commence the experiment for subsequent experiments the sand was removed from the flume rewashed with deionized water three times in a recirculated column to remove red dye and nacl and replaced as described above to set up the next experiment four experiments were conducted with different initial concentrations in stream water and sediment properties cases a d in table 1 cases a b and d investigate the effect of density variations due to different initial concentrations low initial concentration c 0 0 23g l 1 in the case a cannot generate profound density variations in the bedform and cases b and c compare layered and homogeneous bedforms table 1 2 3 numerical models the stream water flow over the fixed bedform and hyporheic flow within the streambed was simulated using a sequential coupling method commonly used in hyporheic zone simulations cardenas m and wilson j 2006 janssen et al 2012 chen et al 2015 lu et al 2011 first free surface flow in the flume was modeled in 2d using the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans with the k ω turbulence closure scheme as solved by the pisofoam solver within openfoam weller h et al 1998 the deionized water in the stream mixed well with the solute in the 20 min the buoyancy effect in stream domain was ignored i e solute transport was not included in the stream domain followed with the previous methods jin et al 2011 jin et al 2015 the pressure distribution along the bedform surface was then used as the boundary conditions at the swi for the pore water flow model figure s2 the coupled pore water flow and solute transport in the bed were then simulated within a java application programming interface api of comsol li et al 2009 which provides an easy and efficient way to implement the batch simulations the details of governing equations of pore water flow solute transport within layered bedform and boundary conditions are provided in text s1 specifically case a was simulated with no density effects nde due to low initial concentration i e ρ ρ f cases b c and d were simulated with density effects de due to relatively high concentration difference between stream water and pore water i e ρ ρ f γc although the hydraulic conductivity k 1 k 2 and porosity θ 1 θ 2 of the two types of sands used were measured due to the differences in packing test columns and the flume all four parameters above were calibrated using the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm gill m et al 2006 which was written in c and coupled with the java api code of the model hence it is reasonable to have the different optimal parameters k 1 k 2 θ 1 θ 2 for four experimental cases a b c d the optimization included comparisons of measurements and simulations of the concentration in the stream water the plume location within the bedform and pore water solute concentration profiles best fit model parameters are shown in table 1 the effects of unknown heterogeneity due to sand packing for each layer were ignored in the models i e each layer in the model was assumed as homogenous 2 4 metrics 2 4 1 effective exchange depth in the streambed temporal solute concentration variations in stream water are closely linked to solute transfer into the streambed for a recirculating flume the mass balance between in stream water and pore water can be calculated from the calibrated model using tonina and buffington j 2007 tonina and buffington j 2011 1 c t c 0 1 θ s 0 h e v 0 2 h e h e d 0 d b where c 0 m l 3 is the initial solute concentration in the stream water v 0 l3 is the volume of stream water θ θ is average porosity of the three layers s 0 l2 is horizontally projected water surface area the sum of d 0 l and d b l is the maximum height of the streambed figure s2 here h e is the effective average depth of solute penetration per unit area of the water surface h e is the dimensionless effective depth of solute penetration per unit water surface area 0 h e 1 2 4 2 mixing processes within the streambed density dependent flow leads to greater spatial penetration of the solute and consequently enhances mass transfer due to diffusion and local dispersion which can be quantified by the spatial moments of the solute distribution the two dimensional normalized spatial moments can be written as goltz m and roberts p 1987 3 m i k m i k m 00 θ 1 s 1 x i z k c x z t d s 1 s 3 x i z k c x z t d s 3 θ 2 s 2 x i z k c x z t d s 2 θ 1 s 1 c x z t d s 1 s 3 c x z t d s 3 s 2 c x z t d s 2 the first order normalized spatial moments m 01 m 10 l indicate the center of mass of the concentration distribution in each principal direction while the second order normalized spatial moments m 02 m 20 l2 describe the spread of the deviation from the axes origin for example the second order normalized spatial moment about the center of mass defines the following spatial covariance tensor barry d and sposito 1990 freyberg d 1986

spread of a concentration distribution about its center mass which can be used as a reasonable proxy of mixing along principal directions soltanian m et al 2016 soltanian m et al 2017 i e the farther the solute front deviates from the centroid the more it is mixed the covariance tensor given in 4 is a real symmetric matrix the coordinate system of which can be rotated such that the off diagonal elements vanish this corresponds to computing the eigenvalues and eigenvalues of the original matrix the former are the variances on the matrix diagonal the sum the total variance is a constant independent of the rotation and the latter define the principal axes 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal variation of solute concentration in the recirculating stream changes of solute concentration in the overlying water were measured in three experiments table 1 cases a b and c involving homogeneous and layered streambeds and different initial concentrations for model calibration concentration variations of solute in the stream were determined by considering the solute mass balance between the recirculating stream and the pore water in the layered bedform the time dependent solute concentration in the stream ct is expressed as 8 c t c 0 v 0 b θ 1 s 1 c x z t d s 1 θ 2 s 2 c x z t d s 2 θ 1 s 3 c x z t d s 3 v 0 where c 0 m l 3 is the initial solute concentration in the stream water v 0 l3 is the volume of recirculating water including that in the stream piping and tank b l is the width of flume s 1 l2 s 2 l2 and s 3 l2 are the area of the tl lpl and bl respectively figure s2 due to the differences in packing patterns of the flume experiments the four parameters k 1 k 2 θ 1 θ 2 were separately calibrated for each case table 1 the results of each experiment are shown in fig 2 with the corresponding model predictions in each experiment the model predictions agree well with the flume experiment results as expected all the cases show a decay of the solute concentration in the overlying water the rate of decay was rapid at the beginning of experiment due to the stream bedform interaction followed by a more gradual trend these results show similar trends to those reported in previous flume experiments on hyporheic exchange salehin et al 2004 jin et al 2011 jin et al 2015 packman a et al 2006 marion et al 2008 the effect of density driven flow is evident in the comparison of the normalized time dependent solute concentrations ct c 0 in the stream between cases a and b fig 2 which had identical overlying flow conditions similar sediment structure but different initial solute concentrations in the stream previous studies boano et al 2009 jin et al 2011 showed that density driven flow with different initial solute concentrations in the stream had an important effect on hyporheic exchange in the homogeneous streambed in the layered bedform for cases a and b before 360 min fig s3 the stream water was diluted by upwelling fresh pore water driven by the hydraulic gradients induced by the surface boundary conditions with larger initial solute concentrations case b the density effect de was not obvious in the shallow area that included the lpl similar to the case of a homogeneous streambed jin et al 2011 after 360 min the solute plume passed through the lpl fig 3 b the profound de on the flow in the bl led to a more rapid displacement between upwelling pore water and stream such density gradients case b c 0 1 27 g l 1 hence increased the final dilution rate of stream compared to case a with no density effect nde the effect of the lpl on the exchange between the stream and streambed is obvious in the results of cases b and c fig 2 which had identical overlying flow conditions and a similar initial solute concentration but differed in the sediment structure at the early stage t 100 min the exchange rates within the streambed in cases b with the lpl and c homogeneous are quite close to each other in both cases there was a rapid declining trend fig 2 as the solute plume penetrated into the upper 5 cm of the tl but had yet to reach the lpl as the solute plume kept moving downward and reached the lpl t 100 min the plume penetrated into the deeper area at a reduced rate and so the decline of the solute concentration in the stream was much more gradual in case b than in case c finally the normalized solute concentration in the stream reached a relatively stable level of 0 86 in case b with the lpl and 0 83 in case c fig 2 although the data suggest that these concentrations might continue to decline albeit slowly this value is higher than the expected value predicted from the surface and subsurface water volumes 3 2 characteristics of solute transport in the streambed fig 3 shows the experiment and simulation results that compare the solute transport patterns for different cases table 1 cases a b and d highlight how pore water flow changes at the interfaces between the tl bl and lpl specifically for the tracer transport case a fig 3a the front of the solute plume was regular in the tl similar to the homogeneous case when the front entered the lpl its vertical and lateral extent decreased case a 3 h the lateral solute transport in the bl was greater than within the lpl as also found with the numerical model case a 6 h this occurred due to the increased permeability and the horizontal ambient flow haf induced by the slope of the flume also it was noteworthy that the front of the solute plume within the bl moved upwards towards the leeward face of the bedform case a 6 h and did not reach the bottom of the bedform case a 10 h in contrast for density dependent flow within the layered bedform cases b d the solute transport patterns became markedly different for the moderate density case case b as for case a the downward transport was reduced due to the lpl case b 3 h fig 3b the plume width decreased as it entered the bl case b 6 h due to conservation of flux i e as a result of the hydraulic conductivity change the unstable plume narrows in the bl and forms a fast moving zone both the experiments and numerical simulations show regularly spaced instabilities in the form of unstable fingers at the plume front case b 10 h an obvious question is whether the narrowed and fast moving zone in the bl is only due to density variations which are affected by the bedform s finite depth or a combination of density variations and the layered heterogeneity in the bedform the experimental results for the homogeneous bedform case c fig 3c only show unstable fingers at the solute front i e the fast moving zone was not formed that are similar to those in case b although these are not noticeable in the numerical results until the plume reaches the bedform bottom case c 6 and 10 h at the same time case c 10 h the experimental fingers become more pronounced we conclude that the local flow patterns arising from the finite depth bedform lead to enhanced instability at the plume front in the form of fingering as demonstrated numerically for a flat swi xie y et al 2010 a similar phenomenon was also reported in a field scale simulation jin et al 2015 the high density contrast produces much narrower fast moving zone in the bl case d 3 h due to conservation of flux as described above within the bl the fingers in the solute front rapidly reach the bedform bottom case d 6 h the numerical results demonstrate the complex flow paths induced by the fingers case d 6 and 10 h along with local mixing of the solute in the plume this leads to enhanced dispersion compared with cases of lower density contrasts fig 3d compared with cases a b c and d we conclude that the narrower fast moving zone in the bl was induced by a combination of density variations and the layered heterogeneity in the bedform 3 3 solute concentration profiles in the streambed as mentioned in section 2 1 two vertical arrays of sampling ports d a fig 1b were installed to monitor the concentration profiles in the pore water experimental and simulation results for the three cases cases a b and d all with the lpl are shown in fig 4 for case a fig 4a the constant density model i e nde within the layered streambed predicted the movement of the solute front the stream water with solute was rapidly delivered by shallow pore water flow paths to ports d1 t 72 min and a1 t 122 min in the tl below ports d1 and a1 a comparatively longer time was needed for the solute to pass through the lpl finally the concentration along array d increased slightly with the depth and no solute moved below port d6 at 1318 min fig 4a the model results blue and green lines fig 4a show that the solute front is constrained by the lpl to much shallower parts of the hz in contrast for density dependent flow cases b d the nde model failed to predict the irregular variation of the solute concentration profile after the solute front entered the bl e g d t 1279 min fig 4b the de alters pore water flow patterns resulting in more rapid downward movement of the solute front fig 3b for example when the solute front passed through the lpl to the bl the magnitude and direction of the pore water flow were modified due to the de fig 3b t 6 h 10 h the unstable plume narrowed and moved more rapidly in the bl fig 3b t 6 h and fig 3d t 3 h i e the accumulated solute in the lpl tends to be transported predominately along this narrowed flow path to the bl consequently no solute was detected in either measurement array d a in the bl during this time after the distinct plume fingers reached the bottom of the flume the bottom sampling ports for both the stoss and lee faces measured the solute within the narrowed plume for example ports d9 fig 4b t 1279 min and a9 fig 4b t 1307 min measured the solute front through the bottom circulation path followed in turn by ports d8 d4 and a8 a4 fig 4b t 1616 min the transport rate e g from d8 to d4 was intensified by increasing the initial concentration in the stream fig 4b cf fig 4c here for a certain time e g fig 4c port d t 331 and 383 min the prediction of the concentration profile was higher than the experimental data due to the unstable flow in the bl generally the shape of measured predicted concentration profiles in the layered streambed is different from the corresponding result for a homogenous bedform jin et al 2011 3 4 spatial patterns of solute transport and pore water flow in the hz the shape of the plume area changes when the de and layered heterogeneity are present fig 5 compares the isopleth c 0 8c 0 of the solute plume for different hcc values and shows the spatial extent of solute transport for a nde and b de without density variations i e nde a shallow and relative regular hz formed in the streambed with the lpl larger fractions of solute were confined in the lpl for higher hcc i e greater e g fig 5a k 2 0 01k 1 consistent with other simulations of a previous study gomez velez j et al 2014 complex irregular features of solute fronts in the hz due to random heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity were reported previously fox et al 2016 salehin et al 2004 herein with de considered an unexplored combination of mechanisms density variations and layered heterogeneity triggered the narrowed and fast moving zone beneath the lpl fig 5b k 2 0 1k 1 the observed solute plumes section 3 2 were consistent with the modeled flow fields fig 6 first low velocity zones semicircular blue areas emerged in the lpl fig s 6b d in the layered bedform similar results can be found in hydrogeologic basins with lpls gassiat et al 2013 second hyporheic flow velocities decreased by several orders of magnitude over a depth range of a few centimeters in the layered bedform since de is negligible for low concentration difference between stream water and pore water fig 6b the flow field was steady with the immobile low velocity zones formed within the lpl consequently the plume was not constrained laterally once it reached the bl leading to enhanced lateral spreading in the bl for increased initial concentrations i e de increasing the low velocity zones adjacent to the fast moving plume gradually extended downwards into the bl fig 6c t 9 h and led to narrowing of the solute plume in the bl section 3 2 case b the flow fields in the hz contain stagnation points sps blue areas in fig s 6a d that separate the haf induced by the flume river slope from the hyporheic flow induced by pressure differences along swi various studies highlighted that a variation of the positions of sps greatly influence the vertical hz extension gomez velez j et al 2014 marzadri et al 2016 singh et al 2019 furthermore the reduced darcy flux in the vicinity of sps can lead to accumulation of transported solute and affect groundwater age dating jiang x et al 2011 jiang x et al 2012 upwelling groundwater was identified as an important mechanism constraining the vertical extent of the hz by raising the vertical position of sps gomez velez j et al 2014 marzadri et al 2016 in this study the effect of the lpl on the positions of sps is evident in a comparison of the results of fig s 6a homogenous and 6b including lpl which had identical initial concentrations but different sediment structures in the presence of the lpl the haf became more profound and the sps were shifted noticeably upwards for example for k 2 0 1k 1 in fig 6b the vertical distances of the sp from the streambed bottom increased by a factor of 2 3 compared with homogeneous case effectively moving them to the lower boundary of the lpl in the steady state case no de fig 6b the sps position was time independent resulting in a stable hz i e a balance was attained between hyporheic flow and haf affected by de fig 6c the flow became unsteady resulting in a dynamic hz that progressively extended downwards due to both the negative buoyancy of the plume and the vertical component of the hyporheic flow consequently the hyporheic flow with de progressively overcame the haf promoting downward sps movement a recent numerical study suggests that similar behavior is induced by a change in the hydraulic head at the swi e g during the stream water stage in the rising limp of a flood event singh et al 2019 3 5 effect of hcc k 2 k 1 rt d 1 d 0 and of a discontinuous lpl in the laboratory experiments the effect of concentration gradients on solute transport characteristics was analyzed within the layered streambed in this section a further series of simulations parameters varied as given in table 2 explores how the hcc rt and a discontinuous lpl fig 7 affect solute transport in the streambed the results show that both the magnitude of the hcc and rt have a great impact on the spatial pattern of solute transport which becomes increasingly irregular fig 7a b first as the hcc or rt increased the plume became much narrower in the bl fig 7a k 2 0 1k 1 cf k 2 0 01k 1 second when the ambient flow in the bl was predominantly horizontal lateral solute spreading was enhanced as was the case for a higher hcc e g k 2 0 01k 1 and rt e g d 1 0 5d fig 7a b to investigate how the de changes the pore water flow from the lpl to the bl in fig 8 a normalized pressure along the lpl tl interface lti was defined 9 p p p min p max p min where p m t 2 l 1 p min m t 2 l 1 and p max m t 2 l 1 are respectively the pressure minimum and maximum pressure along the lti the results in fig 8 show that pressure distribution is distinct with different hcc first before solute passes the swi t 0 fig 8a c the pressure distribution along the lti behaved like a sine function with low hcc k 2 k 1 k 2 0 1k 1 while a near linear distribution was obtained with increasing hcc k 2 0 01k 1 second when the solute front reached the lti k 2 0 01k 1 t 33 h the normalized pressure distribution was markedly modified by de in a higher hcc a low pressure area was formed at the end of the downwelling area i e a convergence of solute from lpl transport towards to the low pressure area this behavior helps explain the narrowed plume within the bl in fig 7a k 2 0 01k 1 the cumulative vertical influx across the lti was correspondingly calculated fig s4 a higher hcc e g k 2 0 01k 1 increased the time scale for solute to enter the bl and the cumulative influx declined 98 2 compared with the homogeneous case a discontinuous lpl with density driven flow was also considered fig 7c for the case of a lower hcc e g k 2 0 1k 1 first the solute was preferentially transported through the high hydraulic conductivity gap between the two lpls k 2 0 1k 1 t 1 4 h as expected as time progressed however the solute plume also penetrated the lpl below the stoss slope creating two areas with increased penetration of the bedform k 2 0 1k 1 t 5 6 h finally the two solute plumes merged below the lpl and transported to the deeper area of the streambed t 11 1 h as the hcc increased e g k 2 0 01 k 1 the transport path through the lpl was completely inhibited t 3 6 h in addition the unstable front of the solute plume passed through the gap between the two lpls forming a finger in the bl that later became detached from the body of the plume t 13 9 h the truncated finger slowly sank downwards reaching the bottom of the bedform at t 20 h this process i e the detachment and consequent sinking of the detached fingers then repeated results not shown 3 6 effective exchange depth in the streambed the dimensionless effective depth defined in section 2 4 1 of solute penetration was quantified from simulation results with different initial concentration hcc rt the solute penetrates the layered streambed in two stages fig 9 a h e in the first stage t 100 min due to water bedform interaction the solute advects at a rapid rate that is approximately linear in t for this stage the initial solute concentration in the stream water has little effect in the second stage h e changes more gradually no longer linear in t due to the gradual decrease of solute concentration in the stream water differences in h e arising from the different initial concentrations c 0 from 1 10 g l 1 in the stream water become obvious with increasing t as higher c 0 drives solute deeper into the bedform e g t 360 min the solute front is confined in a relatively shallow area for the nde case the effect of c 0 is noticeable in the results in fig 9a for example the solute penetration for c 0 1 g l 1 was a factor of 1 6 greater than that for the nde case at t 360 min the effective penetration rate was also influenced by the hcc k 2 k 1 fig 9b the duration of the first stage was similar under different hccs being mainly dominated by the head difference across the streambed while the difference was clear in the second stage with the higher hcc e g k 2 0 01k 1 the solute concentration in the stream water decreased less due to the increased effect of the lpl the density driven flow was correspondingly weakened in the second stage hence the hyporheic penetration depth increased at a much slower rate and more time are needed for solute to penetrate to the bottom of the streambed the impact of the rt d 1 d 0 on the effective penetration depth is shown in fig 9c for a thick tl i e the position of the lpl is deeper d 1 0 5d 0 fig 9c the first stage solute penetration lasts longer t 360 min in the second stage the solute penetration due to the density dependent flow is attenuated compared with haf when the lpl is deeper so the time for solute to reach the bottom of the streambed increases the haf induced by the flume slope in this case also limited the vertical transport as discussed in section 3 5 in contrast when the tl was removed i e the lpl was just below the streambed d 1 0 fig 9c the duration of the first stage is negligible while the second stage developed similarly to the case of the homogeneous bedform without the constraint of the lpl 3 7 plume displacement and mixing processes in the layered bedform fig 10 a shows concentration distributions after 30 of the initially present pore water was replaced the distributions vary considerably as a function of different conditions downward displacements became increasingly unstable with increasing concentration gradients and hcc resulting in fingering beneath the lpl the displacement time for the 30 displacement computed for different surface water concentrations and hcc values is given in fig 10b as expected the time for gravitationally unstable vertical displacement is less than that for the nde case especially in the case of high hcc e g k 2 0 01k 1 the increase in initial concentration results in an increase in the downward displacement rate and consequently enhanced convective unstable displacement nevertheless the effect of increasing hcc favors the development of horizontal flow beneath the lpl which limits the vertical solute penetration section 3 5 and hence inhibits the vertical solute displacement for example for c 0 1 g l 1 and k 2 0 01k 1 it took approximately 50 h for 30 of the initial pore water to be replaced in comparison with 1 7 h for the homogeneous bedform fig 10b we consider the components of the estimated spatial tensor evolution in 4 from the first contact of the solute with the streambed fig 11 in the homogeneous streambed the horizonal and vertical mixing σ 11 2 σ 22 2 can be divided into three phases fig 11a c the horizonal mixing linear part in the first phase t 70 min was enhanced by near surface hydraulic gradients and the mixing was similar to the nde case with de considered e g c 0 5 g l 1 the impact of density variations on the vertical transport was profound at a1 and the resulting solute finger reduced the horizonal spreading fig s5a a1 hence σ 11 2 decreased slightly from the critical time a1 to a2 fig 11a phase 2 when the density driven flow was constrained by the bottom boundary figure s5a a2 horizonal mixing was subsequently enhanced and reached a stable stage fig 11a phase 3 the vertical mixing σ 22 2 linear part in the first phase t 30 min was increased by near surface hydraulic gradients fig s5a b1 with de considered vertical motion increased as c 0 increased from 1 to 5 g l 1 resulting in increased spreading and mixing of the plume fig 11c phase 2 when the solute front arrived at the bottom boundary of the streambed fig s5a b2 some irregular upwelling zones blue area existed i e the unstable solute plume arriving the bottom boundary subsequently induced upward transport to fill the blue areas this behavior helps explain the decreasing trend from b2 in fig 11c phase 3 as for the homogenous bedform the horizonal and vertical mixing fig 11b d in the layered bedform is divided into three phases since the downward solute transport was inhibited by the lpl the horizonal spreading was hence enhanced in the tl fig s5b c1 the value σ 11 2 in the first phase nearly linear was larger than homogenous bedform fig 11b as explained above the plumes in the lpl and bl both narrowed with increasing de therefore the duration of phase 2 declining trend was much longer fig 11b c1 c2 than that for the homogenous bedform the vertical mixing σ 22 2 in the first nearly linear phase lasts for a longer time than the homogeneous case fig 11d t 100 min due to the existence of the lpl fig s5b d1 after the solute plume passed through the lpl i e phase 2 fig 11d the vertical mixing rate was enhanced by convection driven fingering i e there is a transition from diffusion dominated mixing in the lpl to a convection dominated regime beneath the lpl previous studies found that mixing is dominated by diffusion in low permeability zones of a layered system agartan et al 2015 the vertical mixing rate sharply increased with increasing de in phase 2 until σ 22 2 reached its maximum when the plume reached the bottom of the bedform after the peak mixing time an upward solute transport blue area following the upwelling pore water was found phase 3 in fig s5b d2 i e the vertical deviation between the solute front and the centroid gradually declined and the mixing correspondingly decayed to a stable level fig 11d the off diagonal component of σ 2 σ 12 2 was also calculated fig 11e f for the homogenous and layered bedforms the magnitude of this component is small compared with σ 11 2 and σ 22 2 the increasing decreasing trend for different times in fig 11e f reflects that the asymmetrical shape of the plume was enhanced inhibited during the spreading process this process thus indicates the rotation of the spreading plume the total variance fig s6a b closely follows the variance along the vertical direction fig 11c d i e the solute spread is dominated by the vertical component 4 concluding remarks laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the combined effects of density variations and layered heterogeneity on hyporheic flow in the stream bedform interaction of fluvial systems the combined experimental numerical results show that a previously unexplored combination of mechanisms density effects and layered heterogeneity control the irregular spatial pattern of solute transport in the hyporheic zone for the case of tracer transport the low permeability layer reduced the vertical and lateral extent of the solute transport and the lateral solute transport in the bottom layer was greater than within the low permeability layer in addition with density dependent flow considered the width of the solute plume within the bottom layers narrowed during unstable de flow as the density contrast between infiltrating solute and resident water increased the plume becomes much narrower in the bottom layers and forms unstable fingers which further enhances solute transfer and causes significant mixing within the layered system the magnitude of hydraulic conductivity contrast and relative thickness both have a major impact on the irregular spatial patterns of solute transport first as the hydraulic conductivity contrast or relative thickness increased the plume becomes much narrower in the bottom layers second high hydraulic conductivity contrast or relative thickness favor the development of horizontal ambient flow and hence enhances lateral solute spreading and mixing beneath the low permeability layer the vertical solute plume was detached by the horizontal ambient flow in the bottom layers with a discontinuous low permeability layer forming a discontinuous zone of vertical solute transport the transport mechanisms described here have the potential to affect streambed biogeochemistry with density effects penetration of stream water into deeper parts of the streambed is enhanced if this water carries significant dissolved oxygen into anoxic zones then there is an increased likelihood of enhanced rates of transformation of organic matter in those zones for instance credit authorship contribution

460,hyporheic exchange is affected by bedform geometry which induces complex flow paths within the bedform additional factors that influence flow and solute transport in the hyporheic zone are layered profile sediments and density driven flow this study explored the combined effects of these factors on hyporheic exchange through laboratory experiments and numerical simulations involving infiltrating solute displacing less dense resident water in a layered bedform with a low permeability layer lpl the bedform consisted of three horizontal layers in which the hydraulic conductivity of the middle layer lpl was less than that of the top tl and bottom layers bl the results demonstrated that a previously unexplored combination of mechanisms density effects and layered bedform produces irregular spatial patterns of solute transport in the hyporheic zone for instance the width of solute plume within the bottom layers becomes narrowed compared with tracer transport with increasing density contrast between infiltrating solute and resident water the solute plume becomes much narrower forming fingers numerical modeling further shows that the hydraulic conductivity contrast hcc and relative thickness rt of the hyporheic zone layers also affect the spatial solute transport patterns as the hydraulic conductivity contrast or relative thickness increases the plume becomes much narrower horizontal ambient flow haf dominated in the bottom layers and lateral solute spreading and mixing intensified with a higher hydraulic conductivity contrast and relative thickness furthermore the vertical solute plume was detached by the horizontal ambient flow in the bottom layers with a discontinuous low permeability layer forming a discontinuous zone of vertical solute transport

but also control the exchange of water and solutes across the sediment water interface swi elliott a and brooks 1997 packman a and mackay 2003 hyporheic exchange in which water and solutes enter the streambed and are transported within it for different paths before returning to the stream occurs over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales cardenas m 2008 stonedahl s et al 2010 this process affects the fate and transport characteristics of different solutes within streambed packman a et al 2000 ren and packman 2004 ecosystem services in relation to nutrient cycling zarnetske et al 2012 trauth et al 2014 and carbon fluxes battin t et al 2008 findlay et al 1993 the resulting area of this exchange within the streambed known as the hyporheic zone hz is thus a key element of stream ecological functioning harvey j and gooseff 2015 boulton a et al 1998 and has a substantial impact on water quality of fluvial ecosystems hancock p et al 2005 findlay 1995 lewandowski et al 2019 knowledge of the drivers e g streambed topography turbulence wave pumping buoyancy forces of hyporheic exchange is essential for understanding solute transport characteristics within the streambed streambed topography as a major driver of hyporheic exchange can range from small bedforms e g ripples dunes cardenas m and wilson j 2007 that scale with the stream depth to larger geomorphologic features that scale with the stream width e g bars riffles tonina and buffington j 2007 tonina and buffington j 2011 these features affect hydraulic head gradients along the swi which drive hyporheic flow circulation of different lateral extents and penetration depths many experimental and numerical modelling studies investigated the effects of streambed topography on the swi exchange flux and solute transport characteristics within the hz ren and packman 2004 cardenas m and wilson j 2007 packman a et al 2000 boano et al 2007 fox et al 2014 generally the streambed morphology significantly affects solute residence times and flow paths within the hz due to surface subsurface interactions under different surface flow regimes cardenas m and wilson j 2007 boano et al 2013 despite the considerable research on streambed topography induced hyporheic exchange sediment heterogeneity a common feature of streambeds is usually neglected packman a et al 2000 boano et al 2007 fox et al 2014 cardenas m and wilson j 2006 indeed streambeds in natural rivers can often be spatially structured with permeability contrasts of 2 5 orders of magnitude between different zones kennedy c et al 2009 this variability can induce solute fluxes that are different to those under homogenous sediment conditions cardenas m et al 2004 laboratory experiments and simulations that investigated effects of streambed heterogeneity on hyporheic exchange due to the random permeability field distributions demonstrated the potential irregular spatial extent of the hz and associated spatially variable interfacial fluxes fox et al 2016 salehin et al 2004 another typical type of the heterogeneous structure is the layered streambed with a low permeability layer lpl which results from episodic deposition processes such as in the huaihe river one of the major rivers in china figure s1 and other lowland rivers angermann et al 2012 krause et al 2014 sebok et al 2015 a lpl was sampled in streambed cores from the huaihe river these cores exhibit layering and a corresponding vertical heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity sebok et al 2015 an overall aim of this work is to determine the effect of layered streambed profiles on hz flow and transport motivated by the abovementioned field observations we considered a three layered streambed profile with the middle lpl layer having a relatively low hydraulic conductivity it is known that the presence of an lpl can lead to flow confinement in combination with regional groundwater upwelling gomez velez j et al 2014 in addition to spatially varying sediment properties the stream water composition and hence density can also vary there has been increased salinization of stream water over decades due to the use of road salt deicers and wastewater discharges chen et al 2014 schaper j et al 2019 wagner döbler et al 2000 kaushal s et al 2005 the short term conductivity fluctuations and hence increasing salinity of stream water is sufficient to induce density variations in the hz flow patterns when both free i e gravity driven transport and forced convection i e hydraulically driven transport operate simultaneously to drive exchange of river water across the swi the resulting mixed convective flow can considerably affect solute spreading and mixing within streambeds konikow l et al 2013 for example the experimental study of boano et al 2009 demonstrated that density contrasts drive hyporheic exchange across a flat streambed jin et al 2011 2015 found that density induced convection is more likely to dominate in deep hyporheic regions within dunes and can inhibit solute release from sediment to stream water although previous studies revealed how streambed heterogeneity and density contrasts impact hyporheic exchange these factors were considered in isolation using laboratory experiments and numerical modeling this study aims to elucidate the effects of solute induced density contrasts on flow and transport within a three layered bedform as motivated by field observations from the huaihe river figure s1 the experimental data are examined in conjunction with numerical simulation results focusing on i the different transport characteristics for conservative solute transport within bedforms under the combined effects of density variations and layered streambeds ii the mechanisms that control irregular and unstable transport within the hz and iii the effects of density gradients hcc rt and discontinuous lpl on hz flow and solute transport patterns 2 methodologies 2 1 experimental setup and measurements experiments were carried out in a recirculating tilting flume consisting of a 3 45 m long 0 1 m wide and 0 7 m deep rectangular channel fig 1 a the front side of the flume was made of perspex to visualize the sand geometry and tracer transport within the bedform two vertical arrays of micro ports for pore water sampling were located at unequal intervals on the stoss and lee sides of the fourth bedform fig 1b stream water was continuously recirculated from the storage tank located below the flume channel the discharge was controlled by a valve and measured with an electromagnetic flow meter similar to previous flume experiments jin et al 2010 a perforated pvc plate and a curved plastic box 30 cm length and a maximum height of 30 cm were installed in the inlet section to dissipate energy and reduce flow turbulence respectively a fixed streambed geometry was used fig 1b the bedform shape was triangular with dimensions 0 35 m long 0 30 m deep and 0 025 m high table 1 at the downstream end of the channel a water pervious perforated perspex sheet covered by a fine mesh was used to hold the sediment in place and an adjustable height discharge gate was installed in the outlet section to keep the same stream water depth on all bedforms solute transport within the bedform was investigated by introducing a non reactive conservative dye fd c red 40 roha dyechem ltd no effect on fluid density and a salt solution into the recirculating water in the storage tank when the tracer solution flowed over the fixed periodic streambed through the pipe the electrical conductivity ec was measured with a conductivity meter dds 11a sensor shanghai precision and scientific instrument company in the first 20 min after the commencement of the experiment the stream tracer concentration was measured at different positions i e inlet middle and outlet of the flume channel to calculate the average concentration the stream tracer concentration was thereafter measured at the end of the flume fig 1a for the duration of the experiment the solute plume within the streambed was monitored using high resolution digital images recorded every 1 min for 24 h through the flume glass wall at the middle of the flume a total of 4 dunes out of 9 were captured by the images additionally a 100 µl syringe was used to collect pore water samples through silica rubber septa located in sampling ports on the rear of the flume the time interval of pore water sampling was 25 min at the beginning of the experiment to capture the relatively rapid concentration change as the solute was transferred into the bed as the experiment continued the concentration change became gradual after the passage of the local solute front thus the sampling time interval was increased to hours towards to the end of the experiment 2 2 preparation of layered streambed and experimental procedure two kinds of uniform artificial sands nanjing ninglei sand and stone factory were used for the layered streambed the median grain size was 0 37 mm for the coarse sand and 0 21 mm for the fine sand the sands were washed with deionized water in a cylindrical circulation device then added to the flume jin et al 2010 the bulk porosity of sands which was measured using the imbibition method collins r 1976 was 0 46 for the coarse sand θ 1 and 0 47 for the fine sand θ 2 the saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using a column subjected to a constant head drop with values of 5 5 10 3 and 6 6 10 4 m s 1 for the coarse k 1 and fine sand k 2 respectively table 1 before the experiment started we first drew 10 dots in the perspex on the front side of the flume and connected them with a mark pen the thickness d 1mm two horizonal lines i e the interface between low permeability layer and top layer low permeability layer and bottom layer were formed to ensure a straight line between these points the elevation of the first and last point was less than 1 mm with the help of spirit level i e the angle of inclination for the horizontal line of 9 bedforms θ arctan 0 1 35 9 0 018 the bottom layer was constructed by depositing coarse sand through the stream water column along the horizontal line for the surface of the bottom layer we kept all coarse sands in the thickness of the horizontal line the surface was then flatted using a triangular perforated plastic template above the bottom layer the fine sand was added to build the low permeability layer resulting in the layout shown in fig 1b i e a 0 2 m layer of the coarse sand at the bottom of the flume overlain by a 0 05 m lpl above the lpl the coarse sand was added to build the top layer the bedform surface was formed using a triangular perforated plastic template after the bedforms were completed the water flow in the flume commenced with a flow rate with 0 13 m s 1 for 0 5 h to establish a quasi steady flow condition for the given flume slope of 0 0003 with the initial condition established the contents of the storage tank were then switched to solute to commence the experiment for subsequent experiments the sand was removed from the flume rewashed with deionized water three times in a recirculated column to remove red dye and nacl and replaced as described above to set up the next experiment four experiments were conducted with different initial concentrations in stream water and sediment properties cases a d in table 1 cases a b and d investigate the effect of density variations due to different initial concentrations low initial concentration c 0 0 23g l 1 in the case a cannot generate profound density variations in the bedform and cases b and c compare layered and homogeneous bedforms table 1 2 3 numerical models the stream water flow over the fixed bedform and hyporheic flow within the streambed was simulated using a sequential coupling method commonly used in hyporheic zone simulations cardenas m and wilson j 2006 janssen et al 2012 chen et al 2015 lu et al 2011 first free surface flow in the flume was modeled in 2d using the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans with the k ω turbulence closure scheme as solved by the pisofoam solver within openfoam weller h et al 1998 the deionized water in the stream mixed well with the solute in the 20 min the buoyancy effect in stream domain was ignored i e solute transport was not included in the stream domain followed with the previous methods jin et al 2011 jin et al 2015 the pressure distribution along the bedform surface was then used as the boundary conditions at the swi for the pore water flow model figure s2 the coupled pore water flow and solute transport in the bed were then simulated within a java application programming interface api of comsol li et al 2009 which provides an easy and efficient way to implement the batch simulations the details of governing equations of pore water flow solute transport within layered bedform and boundary conditions are provided in text s1 specifically case a was simulated with no density effects nde due to low initial concentration i e ρ ρ f cases b c and d were simulated with density effects de due to relatively high concentration difference between stream water and pore water i e ρ ρ f γc although the hydraulic conductivity k 1 k 2 and porosity θ 1 θ 2 of the two types of sands used were measured due to the differences in packing test columns and the flume all four parameters above were calibrated using the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm gill m et al 2006 which was written in c and coupled with the java api code of the model hence it is reasonable to have the different optimal parameters k 1 k 2 θ 1 θ 2 for four experimental cases a b c d the optimization included comparisons of measurements and simulations of the concentration in the stream water the plume location within the bedform and pore water solute concentration profiles best fit model parameters are shown in table 1 the effects of unknown heterogeneity due to sand packing for each layer were ignored in the models i e each layer in the model was assumed as homogenous 2 4 metrics 2 4 1 effective exchange depth in the streambed temporal solute concentration variations in stream water are closely linked to solute transfer into the streambed for a recirculating flume the mass balance between in stream water and pore water can be calculated from the calibrated model using tonina and buffington j 2007 tonina and buffington j 2011 1 c t c 0 1 θ s 0 h e v 0 2 h e h e d 0 d b where c 0 m l 3 is the initial solute concentration

height of the streambed figure s2 here h e is the effective average depth of solute penetration per unit area of the water surface h e is the dimensionless effective depth of solute penetration per unit water surface area 0 h e 1 2 4 2 mixing processes within the streambed density dependent flow leads to greater spatial penetration of the solute and consequently enhances mass transfer due to diffusion and local dispersion which can be quantified by the spatial moments of the solute distribution the two dimensional normalized spatial moments can be written as goltz m and roberts p 1987 3 m

moments m 01 m 10 l indicate the center of mass of the concentration distribution in each principal direction while the second order normalized spatial moments m 02 m 20 l2 describe the spread of the deviation from the axes origin for example the second order normalized spatial moment about the center of mass defines the following spatial covariance tensor barry d and sposito 1990 freyberg d 1986

spread of a concentration distribution about its center mass which can be used as a reasonable proxy of mixing along principal directions soltanian m et al 2016 soltanian m et al 2017 i e the farther the solute front deviates from the centroid the more it is mixed the covariance tensor given in 4 is a real symmetric matrix the coordinate system of which can be rotated such that the off diagonal elements vanish this corresponds to computing the eigenvalues and eigenvalues of the original matrix the former are the variances on the matrix diagonal the sum the total variance is a constant independent of the rotation and the latter define the principal axes 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal variation of solute concentration in the recirculating stream changes of solute concentration in the overlying water were measured in three experiments table 1 cases a b and c involving homogeneous and layered streambeds and different initial concentrations for model calibration concentration variations of solute in the stream were determined by considering the solute mass balance between the recirculating stream and the pore water in the layered bedform the time dependent solute concentration in the stream ct is expressed as 8 c t c 0 v 0 b θ 1 s 1 c x z t d s 1 θ 2 s 2 c x z t d s 2 θ 1 s 3 c x z t d s 3 v 0 where c 0 m l 3 is the initial solute concentration in the stream water v 0 l3 is the volume of recirculating water including that in the stream piping and tank b l is the width of flume s 1 l2 s 2 l2 and s 3 l2 are the area of the tl lpl and bl respectively figure s2 due to the differences in packing patterns of the flume experiments the four parameters k 1 k 2 θ 1 θ 2 were separately calibrated for each case table 1 the results of each experiment are shown in fig 2 with the corresponding model predictions in each experiment the model predictions agree well with the flume experiment results as expected all the cases show a decay of the solute concentration in the overlying water the rate of decay was rapid at the beginning of experiment due to the stream bedform interaction followed by a more gradual trend these results show similar trends to those reported in previous flume experiments on hyporheic exchange salehin et al 2004 jin et al 2011 jin et al 2015 packman a et al 2006 marion et al 2008 the effect of density driven flow is evident in the comparison of the normalized time dependent solute concentrations ct c 0 in the stream between cases a and b fig 2 which had identical overlying flow conditions similar sediment structure but different initial solute concentrations in the stream previous studies boano et al 2009 jin et al 2011 showed that density driven flow with different initial solute concentrations in the stream had an important effect on hyporheic exchange in the homogeneous streambed in the layered bedform for cases a and b before 360 min fig s3 the stream water was diluted by upwelling fresh pore water driven by the hydraulic gradients induced by the surface boundary conditions with larger initial solute concentrations case b the density effect de was not obvious in the shallow area that included the lpl similar to the case of a homogeneous streambed jin et al 2011 after 360 min the solute plume passed through the lpl fig 3 b the profound de on the flow in the bl led to a more rapid displacement between upwelling pore water and stream such density gradients case b c 0 1 27 g l 1 hence increased the final dilution rate of stream compared to case a with no density effect nde the effect of the lpl on the exchange between the stream and streambed is obvious in the results of cases b and c fig 2 which had identical overlying flow conditions and a similar initial solute concentration but differed in the sediment structure at the early stage t 100 min the exchange rates within the streambed in cases b with the lpl and c homogeneous are quite close to each other in both cases there was a rapid declining trend fig 2 as the solute plume penetrated into the upper 5 cm of the tl but had yet to reach the lpl as the solute plume kept moving downward and reached the lpl t 100 min the plume penetrated into the deeper area at a reduced rate and so the decline of the solute concentration in the stream was much more gradual in case b than in case c finally the normalized solute concentration in the stream reached a relatively stable level of 0 86 in case b with the lpl and 0 83 in case c fig 2 although the data suggest that these concentrations might continue to decline albeit slowly this value is higher than the expected value predicted from the surface and subsurface water volumes 3 2 characteristics of solute transport in the streambed fig 3 shows the experiment and simulation results that compare the solute transport patterns for different cases table 1 cases a b and d highlight how pore water flow changes at the interfaces between the tl bl and lpl specifically for the tracer transport case a fig 3a the front of the solute plume was regular in the tl similar to the homogeneous case when the front entered the lpl its vertical and lateral extent decreased case a 3 h the lateral solute transport in the bl was greater than within the lpl as also found with the numerical model case a 6 h this occurred due to the increased permeability and the horizontal ambient flow haf induced by the slope of the flume also it was noteworthy that the front of the solute plume within the bl moved upwards towards the leeward face of the bedform case a 6 h and did not reach the bottom of the bedform case a 10 h in contrast for density dependent flow within the layered bedform cases b d the solute transport patterns became markedly different for the moderate density case case b as for case a the downward transport was reduced due to the lpl case b 3 h fig 3b the plume width decreased as it entered the bl case b 6 h due to conservation of flux i e as a result of the hydraulic conductivity change the unstable plume narrows in the bl and forms a fast moving zone both the experiments and numerical simulations show regularly spaced instabilities in the form of unstable fingers at the plume front case b 10 h an obvious question is whether the narrowed and fast moving zone in the bl is only due to density variations which are affected by the bedform s finite depth or a combination of density variations and the layered heterogeneity in the bedform the experimental results for the homogeneous bedform case c fig 3c only show unstable fingers at the solute front i e the fast moving zone was not formed that are similar to those in case b although these are not noticeable in the numerical results until the plume reaches the bedform bottom case c 6 and 10 h at the same time case c 10 h the experimental fingers become more pronounced we conclude that the local flow patterns arising from the finite depth bedform lead to enhanced instability at the plume front in the form of fingering as demonstrated numerically for a flat swi xie y et al 2010 a similar phenomenon was also reported in a field scale simulation jin et al 2015 the high density contrast produces much narrower fast moving zone in the bl case d 3 h due to conservation of flux as described above within the bl the fingers in the solute front rapidly reach the bedform bottom case d 6 h the numerical results demonstrate the complex flow paths induced by the fingers case d 6 and 10 h along with local mixing of the solute in the plume this leads to enhanced dispersion compared with cases of lower density contrasts fig 3d compared with cases a b c and d we conclude that the narrower fast moving zone in the bl was induced by a combination of density variations and the layered heterogeneity in the bedform 3 3 solute concentration profiles in the streambed as mentioned in section 2 1 two vertical arrays of sampling ports d a fig 1b were installed to monitor the concentration profiles in the pore water experimental and simulation results for the three cases cases a b and d all with the lpl are shown in fig 4 for case a fig 4a the constant density model i e nde within the layered streambed predicted the movement of the solute front the stream water with solute was rapidly delivered by shallow pore water flow paths to ports d1 t 72 min and a1 t 122 min in the tl below ports d1 and a1 a comparatively longer time was needed for the solute to pass through the lpl finally the concentration along array d increased slightly with the depth and no solute moved below port d6 at 1318 min fig 4a the model results blue and green lines fig 4a show that the solute front is constrained by the lpl to much shallower parts of the hz in contrast for density dependent flow cases b d the nde model failed to predict the irregular variation of the solute concentration profile after the solute front entered the bl e g d t 1279 min fig 4b the de alters pore water flow patterns resulting in more rapid downward movement of the solute front fig 3b for example when the solute front passed through the lpl to the bl the magnitude and direction of the pore water flow were modified due to the de fig 3b t 6 h 10 h the unstable plume narrowed and moved more rapidly in the bl fig 3b t 6 h and fig 3d t 3 h i e the accumulated solute in the lpl tends to be transported predominately along this narrowed flow path to the bl consequently no solute was detected in either measurement array d a in the bl during this time after the distinct plume fingers reached the bottom of the flume the bottom sampling ports for both the stoss and lee faces measured the solute within the narrowed plume for example ports d9 fig 4b t 1279 min and a9 fig 4b t 1307 min measured the solute front through the bottom circulation path followed in turn by ports d8 d4 and a8 a4 fig 4b t 1616 min the transport rate e g from d8 to d4 was intensified by increasing the initial concentration in the stream fig 4b cf fig 4c here for a certain time e g fig 4c port d t 331 and 383 min the prediction of the concentration profile was higher than the experimental data due to the unstable flow in the bl generally the shape of measured predicted concentration profiles in the layered streambed is different from the corresponding result for a homogenous bedform jin et al 2011 3 4 spatial patterns of solute transport and pore water flow in the hz the shape of the plume area changes when the de and layered heterogeneity are present fig 5 compares the isopleth c 0 8c 0 of the solute plume for different hcc values and shows the spatial extent of solute transport for a nde and b de without density variations i e nde a shallow and relative regular hz formed in the streambed with the lpl larger fractions of solute were confined in the lpl for higher hcc i e greater e g fig 5a k 2 0 01k 1 consistent with other simulations of a previous study gomez velez j et al 2014 complex irregular features of solute fronts in the hz due to random heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity were reported previously fox et al 2016 salehin et al 2004 herein with de considered an unexplored combination of mechanisms density variations and layered heterogeneity triggered the narrowed and fast moving zone beneath the lpl fig 5b k 2 0 1k 1 the observed solute plumes section 3 2 were consistent with the modeled flow fields fig 6 first low velocity zones semicircular blue areas emerged in the lpl fig s 6b d in the layered bedform similar results can be found in hydrogeologic basins with lpls gassiat et al 2013 second hyporheic flow velocities decreased by several orders of magnitude over a depth range of a few centimeters in the layered bedform since de is negligible for low concentration difference between stream water and pore water fig 6b the flow field was steady with the immobile low velocity zones formed within the lpl consequently the plume was not constrained laterally once it reached the bl leading to enhanced lateral spreading in the bl for increased initial concentrations i e de increasing the low velocity zones adjacent to the fast moving plume gradually extended downwards into the bl fig 6c t 9 h and led to narrowing of the solute plume in the bl section 3 2 case b the flow fields in the hz contain stagnation points sps blue areas in fig s 6a d that separate the haf induced by the flume river slope from the hyporheic flow induced by pressure differences along swi various studies highlighted that a variation of the positions of sps greatly influence the vertical hz extension gomez velez j et al 2014 marzadri et al 2016 singh et al 2019 furthermore the reduced darcy flux in the vicinity of sps can lead to accumulation of transported solute and affect groundwater age dating jiang x et al 2011 jiang x et al 2012 upwelling groundwater was identified as an important mechanism constraining the vertical extent of the hz by raising the vertical position of sps gomez velez j et al 2014 marzadri et al 2016 in this study the effect of the lpl on the positions of sps is evident in a comparison of the results of fig s 6a homogenous and 6b including lpl which had identical initial concentrations but different sediment structures in the presence of the lpl the haf became more profound and the sps were shifted noticeably upwards for example for k 2 0 1k 1 in fig 6b the vertical distances of the sp from the streambed bottom increased by a factor of 2 3 compared with homogeneous case effectively moving them to the lower boundary of the lpl in the steady state case no de fig 6b the sps position was time independent resulting in a stable hz i e a balance was attained between hyporheic flow and haf affected by de fig 6c the flow became unsteady resulting in a dynamic hz that progressively extended downwards due to both the negative buoyancy of the plume and the vertical component of the hyporheic flow consequently the hyporheic flow with de progressively overcame the haf promoting downward sps movement a recent numerical study suggests that similar behavior is induced by a change in the hydraulic head at the swi e g during the stream water stage in the rising limp of a flood event singh et al 2019 3 5 effect of hcc k 2 k 1 rt d 1 d 0 and of a discontinuous lpl in the laboratory experiments the effect of concentration gradients on solute transport characteristics was analyzed within the layered streambed in this section a further series of simulations parameters varied as given in table 2 explores how the hcc rt and a discontinuous lpl fig 7 affect solute transport in the streambed the results show that both the magnitude of the hcc and rt have a great impact on the spatial pattern of solute transport which becomes increasingly irregular fig 7a b first as the hcc or rt increased the plume became much narrower in the bl fig 7a k 2 0 1k 1 cf k 2 0 01k 1 second when the ambient flow in the bl was predominantly horizontal lateral solute spreading was enhanced as was the case for a higher hcc e g k 2 0 01k 1 and rt e g d 1 0 5d fig 7a b to investigate how the de changes the pore water flow from the lpl to the bl in fig 8 a normalized pressure along the lpl tl interface lti was defined 9 p p p min p max p min where p m t 2 l 1 p min m t 2 l 1 and p max m t 2 l 1 are respectively the pressure minimum and maximum pressure along the lti the results in fig 8 show that pressure distribution is distinct with different hcc first before solute passes the swi t 0 fig 8a c the pressure distribution along the lti behaved like a sine function with low hcc k 2 k 1 k 2 0 1k 1 while a near linear distribution was obtained with increasing hcc k 2 0 01k 1 second when the solute front reached the lti k 2 0 01k 1 t 33 h the normalized pressure distribution was markedly modified by de in a higher hcc a low pressure area was formed at the end of the downwelling area i e a convergence of solute from lpl transport towards to the low pressure area this behavior helps explain the narrowed plume within the bl in fig 7a k 2 0 01k 1 the cumulative vertical influx across the lti was correspondingly calculated fig s4 a higher hcc e g k 2 0 01k 1 increased the time scale for solute to enter the bl and the cumulative influx declined 98 2 compared with the homogeneous case a discontinuous lpl with density driven flow was also considered fig 7c for the case of a lower hcc e g k 2 0 1k 1 first the solute was preferentially transported through the high hydraulic conductivity gap between the two lpls k 2 0 1k 1 t 1 4 h as expected as time progressed however the solute plume also penetrated the lpl below the stoss slope creating two areas with increased penetration of the bedform k 2 0 1k 1 t 5 6 h finally the two solute plumes merged below the lpl and transported to the deeper area of the streambed t 11 1 h as the hcc increased e g k 2 0 01 k 1 the transport path through the lpl was completely inhibited t 3 6 h in addition the unstable front of the solute plume passed through the gap between the two lpls forming a finger in the bl that later became detached from the body of the plume t 13 9 h the truncated finger slowly sank downwards reaching the bottom of the bedform at t 20 h this process i e the detachment and consequent sinking of the detached fingers then repeated results not shown 3 6 effective exchange depth in the streambed the dimensionless effective depth defined in section 2 4 1 of solute penetration was quantified from simulation results with different initial concentration hcc rt the solute penetrates the layered streambed in two stages fig 9 a h e in the first stage t 100 min due to water bedform interaction the solute advects at a rapid rate that is approximately linear in t for this stage the initial solute concentration in the stream water has little effect in the second stage h e changes more gradually no longer linear in t due to the gradual decrease of solute concentration in the stream water differences in h e arising from the different initial concentrations c 0 from 1 10 g l 1 in the stream water become obvious with increasing t as higher c 0 drives solute deeper into the bedform e g t 360 min the solute front is confined in a relatively shallow area for the nde case the effect of c 0 is noticeable in the results in fig 9a for example the solute penetration for c 0 1 g l 1 was a factor of 1 6 greater than that for the nde case at t 360 min the effective penetration rate was also influenced by the hcc k 2 k 1 fig 9b the duration of the first stage was similar under different hccs being mainly dominated by the head difference across the streambed while the difference was clear in the second stage with the higher hcc e g k 2 0 01k 1 the solute concentration in the stream water decreased less due to the increased effect of the lpl the density driven flow was correspondingly weakened in the second stage hence the hyporheic penetration depth increased at a much slower rate and more time are needed for solute to penetrate to the bottom of the streambed the impact of the rt d 1 d 0 on the effective penetration depth is shown in fig 9c for a thick tl i e the position of the lpl is deeper d 1 0 5d 0 fig 9c the first stage solute penetration lasts longer t 360 min in the second stage the solute penetration due to the density dependent flow is attenuated compared with haf when the lpl is deeper so the time for solute to reach the bottom of the streambed increases the haf induced by the flume slope in this case also limited the vertical transport as discussed in section 3 5 in contrast when the tl was removed i e the lpl was just below the streambed d 1 0 fig 9c the duration of the first stage is negligible while the second stage developed similarly to the case of the homogeneous bedform without the constraint of the lpl 3 7 plume displacement and mixing processes in the layered bedform fig 10 a shows concentration distributions after 30 of the initially present pore water was replaced the distributions vary considerably as a function of different conditions downward displacements became increasingly unstable with increasing concentration gradients and hcc resulting in fingering beneath the lpl the displacement time for the 30 displacement computed for different surface water concentrations and hcc values is given in fig 10b as expected the time for gravitationally unstable vertical displacement is less than that for the nde case especially in the case of high hcc e g k 2 0 01k 1 the increase in initial concentration results in an increase in the downward displacement rate and consequently enhanced convective unstable displacement nevertheless the effect of increasing hcc favors the development of horizontal flow beneath the lpl which limits the vertical solute penetration section 3 5 and hence inhibits the vertical solute displacement for example for c 0 1 g l 1 and k 2 0 01k 1 it took approximately 50 h for 30 of the initial pore water to be replaced in comparison with 1 7 h for the homogeneous bedform fig 10b we consider the components of the estimated spatial tensor evolution in 4 from the first contact of the solute with the streambed fig 11 in the homogeneous streambed the horizonal and vertical mixing σ 11 2 σ 22 2 can be divided into three phases fig 11a c the horizonal mixing linear part in the first phase t 70 min was enhanced by near surface hydraulic gradients and the mixing was similar to the nde case with de considered e g c 0 5 g l 1 the impact of density variations on the vertical transport was profound at a1 and the resulting solute finger reduced the horizonal spreading fig s5a a1 hence σ 11 2 decreased slightly from the critical time a1 to a2 fig 11a phase 2 when the density driven flow was constrained by the bottom boundary figure s5a a2 horizonal mixing was subsequently enhanced and reached a stable stage fig 11a phase 3 the vertical mixing σ 22 2 linear part in the first phase t 30 min was increased by near surface hydraulic gradients fig s5a b1 with de considered vertical motion increased as c 0 increased from 1 to 5 g l 1 resulting in increased spreading and mixing of the plume fig 11c phase 2 when the solute front arrived at the bottom boundary of the streambed fig s5a b2 some irregular upwelling zones blue area existed i e the unstable solute plume arriving the bottom boundary subsequently induced upward transport to fill the blue areas this behavior helps explain the decreasing trend from b2 in fig 11c phase 3 as for the homogenous bedform the horizonal and vertical mixing fig 11b d in the layered bedform is divided into three phases since the downward solute transport was inhibited by the lpl the horizonal spreading was hence enhanced in the tl fig s5b c1 the value σ 11 2 in the first phase nearly linear was larger than homogenous bedform fig 11b as explained above the plumes in the lpl and bl both narrowed with increasing de therefore the duration of phase 2 declining trend was much longer fig 11b c1 c2 than that for the homogenous bedform the vertical mixing σ 22 2 in the first nearly linear phase lasts for a longer time than the homogeneous case fig 11d t 100 min due to the existence of the lpl fig s5b d1 after the solute plume passed through the lpl i e phase 2 fig 11d the vertical mixing rate was enhanced by convection driven fingering i e there is a transition from diffusion dominated mixing in the lpl to a convection dominated regime beneath the lpl previous studies found that mixing is dominated by diffusion in low permeability zones of a layered system agartan et al 2015 the vertical mixing rate sharply increased with increasing de in phase 2 until σ 22 2 reached its maximum when the plume reached the bottom of the bedform after the peak mixing time an upward solute transport blue area following the upwelling pore water was found phase 3 in fig s5b d2 i e the vertical deviation between the solute front and the centroid gradually declined and the mixing correspondingly decayed to a stable level fig 11d the off diagonal component of σ 2 σ 12 2 was also calculated fig 11e f for the homogenous and layered bedforms the magnitude of this component is small compared with σ 11 2 and σ 22 2 the increasing decreasing trend for different times in fig 11e f reflects that the asymmetrical shape of the plume was enhanced inhibited during the spreading process this process thus indicates the rotation of the spreading plume the total variance fig s6a b closely follows the variance along the vertical direction fig 11c d i e the solute spread is dominated by the vertical component 4 concluding remarks laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the combined effects of density variations and layered heterogeneity on hyporheic flow in the stream bedform interaction of fluvial systems the combined experimental numerical results show that a previously unexplored combination of mechanisms density effects and layered heterogeneity control the irregular spatial pattern of solute transport in the hyporheic zone for the case of tracer transport the low permeability layer reduced the vertical and lateral extent of the solute transport and the lateral solute transport in the bottom layer was greater than within the low permeability layer in addition with density dependent flow considered the width of the solute plume within the bottom layers narrowed during unstable de flow as the density contrast between infiltrating solute and resident water increased the plume becomes much narrower in the bottom layers and forms unstable fingers which further enhances solute transfer and causes significant mixing within the layered system the magnitude of hydraulic conductivity contrast and relative thickness both have a major impact on the irregular spatial patterns of solute transport first as the hydraulic conductivity contrast or relative thickness increased the plume becomes much narrower in the bottom layers second high hydraulic conductivity contrast or relative thickness favor the development of horizontal ambient flow and hence enhances lateral solute spreading and mixing beneath the low permeability layer the vertical solute plume was detached by the horizontal ambient flow in the bottom layers with a discontinuous low permeability layer forming a discontinuous zone of vertical solute transport the transport mechanisms described here have the potential to affect streambed biogeochemistry with density effects penetration of stream water into deeper parts of the streambed is enhanced if this water carries significant dissolved oxygen into anoxic zones then there is an increased likelihood of enhanced rates of transformation of organic matter in those zones for instance credit authorship contribution

461,the traveling wave responses in an unsaturated medium induced by a solid force and fluid mass sources are derived in 3d green s functions using the dirac delta function decompositions the wave behaviors are described in pore fluid pressures and solid frame displacement along with fluctuations of capillary pressure in response to time variant fluid injections and solid force loadings these solutions are numerically calculated and analyzed for unconsolidated sands as a function of water saturation as representative examples our results reveal and validate four wave modes a fast compressional wave p1 two slow compressional waves p2 and p3 and a shear wave the p1 wave and shear wave can be effectively observed the slow waves with diffusive characters bear low amplitudes and low velocities the traveling waves in the pore fluid pressures and solid displacement are sensitive to the different sources and the water saturation the solid force induces the total stress perturbation while the fluid mass sources directly make the volume strains in the fluid phases this fluid solid coupling difference causes the distinct traveling wave signature contrasts in the pore fluid and solid frame response amplitudes and tendencies with water retention for the variation of water saturation the traveling wave shows a nonmonotonic feature the fluctuation of capillary pressure exhibits a concave upward relationship which can further interpret the changes of wave amplitude with water saturation a solid force may enhance the fluctuation however for high water saturation the interactive fluid solid effect by the solid force may break the fluid contact due to the extremely compressible air key words poroelasticity unsaturated porous media traveling waves 1 introduction the dynamic responses in porous media saturated by two immiscible fluids are phenomena of great importance in a variety of natural engineering and industrial problems including geological co2 sequestration benson and cole 2008 steeb et al 2012 controlled hydraulic fracturing shapiro 2015 hamzehpour et al 2016 and enhanced oil gas recovery deng and cardenas 2013 mason and morrow 2013 karve and kallivokas 2015 a common process in multiphase media is the interaction of fluids and solid which affects the dynamic motions e g the traveling wave generation and propagation the fluid and solid behaviors are governed by the mechanical couplings of capillary force viscous force and inertial force between them this procedure is complicated by the wave induced fluid flows wiff in different pore space scales and consequently the dynamic response pattern in a medium can range from different scales on the traveling wave propagations in porous media containing a single fluid biot 1956 1962 proposed a model to distinguish the solid frame and pore fluid displacement responses via the two phase wave equation by the global viscous fluid and solid coupling the propagation of traveling waves can be estimated by the dynamic impulse responses in the solid and fluid e g norris 1985 boutin 1991 müller 2006 this mechanism is further verified in the rock physics experiment by the existence of the second compressional wave the biot slow p2 wave e g plona 1980 extending approaches based on the biot model were developed to quantitatively account for the effects of partial saturation on the wiff in porous media the coupling in different pore space and saturation must be further depicted e g pride et al 2004 lo et al 2005 beyond the macroscopic fluid solid drag on the dynamic process the problem in describing the impact of immiscible fluids on traveling waves in porous media is to link local flow events and regional cooperative and or competitive wave behaviors actually several researchers are committed to propose reasonable local mechanisms into the upscale framework of the biot model such as double porosity accounting for stiff and compliant pores e g pride et al 2004 ba et al 2016 and patchy saturation for mesoscopic fluid distribution e g johnson 2001 zhang et al 2014 in which the geometry of pore and saturation is considered whereas multiphase fluids in pore space with possible physical couplings may further manifest the actual process by wiff e g santos 1990 lo et al 2005 lo and sposito 2013 which are especially important for near surface hydrogeological occasions partial saturation as occurs routinely in soils in unconsolidated porous media mostly affects the two immiscible fluid motion by the wiff to observe and model these possible coupling among the fluid and solid along traveling wave physical process in pore space is crucial for understanding the fluid mobility and transformation in hydrogeologic formations e g wang 2000 vogler and chrysikopoulos 2002 iassonov and beresnev 2006 elkhoury et al 2006 2011 manga et al 2012 candela et al 2015 lo and lee 2015 stewart and shaw 2015 hasanov et al 2019 therefore to further establish theories that accounts to the two phase fluids with any saturation process can be benefit to further investigation on the complex phenomena of multiphase interactions in unsaturated media whose framework can be resorted to mixture theory e g coussy 2004 garg and nayfeh 1986 tuncay and corapcioglu 1996 as well as wei and muraleetharan 2002 considered the viscous drag by velocity differences between the fluids and solid using parameter averaging and dynamical consistency berryman et al 1998 further took the inertia drag into account by different accelerations between the phases however they imposed an assumption of the constant capillary pressure gradient between the fluid phases during the wave propagations santos et al 1990 firstly constructed a lagrangian model to describe the acoustic waves in porous media containing two immiscible fluids one nonwetting and one wetting air and water that accounts for the fluctuations in capillary pressure viscous and inertial drags in the dynamic responses with volume fractions and coupling mass densities lo et al 2005 as well as lo and sposito 2013 further illustrated possible mechanisms accounting for different velocity and accelerations among the multiphases in a comprehensive eulerian model for acoustic wave behaviors with closed relation of linearized increment of fluid content and porosity despite the growing importance of dynamic coupled wiff in pore under fluid and solid mechanical framework many aspects remain poorly understood one of the fundamental unresolved problems is the definite description the induced displacement and pore pressure evolution in presence of the solid and fluid contacts by wiff seismic oscillation or fluid disposal induces changes in the states both of stress and pressure that can affect the behaviors of the material however the focus of the previous work is mainly on the plane harmonic wave analysis for frequency dependent dispersion and attenuation prediction of wave modes although three compressional waves the p1 wave similar to p wave in elastic media and p1 wave in fluid saturated media e g zhang and ping 2018 and two slow waves the p2 wave corresponding to the biot slow wave and the p3 wave are predicted how they travel through a medium in a time scale measurement is not well understood other than the wave mode analysis the traveling wave effects depend on the initial state of stress fluid content and properties of the hydrogeological formations which are not intuitively obvious and should be further quantified using the unsaturated porous models however there are not many dynamic solutions namely green s function of boundary value problem for the unsaturated differential equation under a concentrated source which is singular at the source location available to further present and illustrate the actual spatiotemporal excitations and responses for the traveling waves yet is very fundamental and powerful in geophysical and hydrological application scenarios e g pan 2019 to obtain and analyze the solutions can help further understand and interpret the actual coupling behaviors observed in unsaturated media in the present work the solution of a three dimensional 3 d medium with possible solid and fluid initial conditions are deduced based on the immiscible fluid saturation in pore space accounting for capillary pressure fluctuation viscous and inertial force fingerings by wiff the fundamental solution is obtained in the frequency domain and the helmholtz decomposition method is chosen to obtain the spatiotemporal solutions we try to shed light on the displacement and pore pressure evolution under seismic and hydrological excitations in particular in scenario whereas the multi wave modes coexist in a unite physical process although we can estimate these perturbations by different velocity estimations but how large is the magnitude of different wave modes meanwhile the analysis performed under various sources will present the wave energy distribution in solid and fluids along with propagations a question also arises that how certain wave radiation patterns appear similar or diverse we choose the material data of unconsolidated sands for example the dynamic fluid mass sources and a solid force inducing the nonmonotonic traveling waves in fluid pressures and solid displacements is discovered as one of the significances of biot s poroelasticity the four traveling waves are identified and analyzed by spatiotemporal observations three compressional waves and one shear wave the p1 wave is propagatory with large amplitude while the p2 wave shows a strongly dispersive character and extremely weak responses mainly in the fluid pressures as the biot slow wave an additional p3 wave also emerges due to the existence of the second porous fluid which is trapped by the sources with extremely low velocity furthermore we also realize the wave behaviors on the variation of saturation process nonmonotonic traveling wave effects on the capillary will be further identified in these special cases finally the results and potential physical explanations in the light of the questions posed above are discussed and concluded in the last part 2 theory 2 1 an unsaturated model the pore pressure pf in a general unified pore space for a two immiscible fluid flow in a deformable porous

fluid pressure solutions are given in appendix b 3 2 fluid sources the fluid source that is the rate of injected fluid per unit volume is represented by γ j j 1 2 the mass conservation for the two

further observe the wave equations contain only divergence fields using the abovementioned potentials hence the curl parts of vector potentials are identically zero in can be inferred that the fluid

corresponding green s functions g j w r r 0 ω j 0 1 2 due to the wetting fluid source can be obtained in the similar way we can see that the dynamic green s functions induced by fluid sources contain only compressional motions the fluid pressure impulse perturbations are also given in appendix b 4 analysis of traveling wave solution the traveling waves can be induced by the different sources as indicated in eqs 23 and 72 we assume the source locate at 5 m 0 m 5 m in a cartesian coordinate the source time function is set as a dynamic process depicted as the ricker wavelet zhang et al 2012 109 f t f 0 1 2 π 2 f 0 2 t 2 exp π 2 f 0 2 t 2 where f 0 is the dominant frequency and f 0 is the amplitude as a scale ratio representing the force and fluid injection magnitude we chose the f 0 50 hz and f 0 1000 for the following discussion the medium properties are listed in table 1 as typical sands rawls et al 1992 lo et al 2007 figs 1 2 and 3 show the traveling waves in the xoz plane with y 0 m that are induced by a dynamic point water injection a an air injection c and a vertical body force c in the water pressure p 2 gas pressure p 1 and vertical solid displacement u z respectively each row shows the waveform snapshots at the corresponding travel time labeled at the left panel by spatial grid 800 400 solution calculations noting the different amplitude scales three compressional waveforms can be identified as the previous plane wave predictions e g lo et al 2005 zhang and ping 2018 the p1 wave travels in the fluids and solid at 177 m s around f 0 the p2 wave travels mainly in the fluids the corresponding responses in the solid are not conspicuous see fig 3 the p2 wave velocity can vary from 2 m s to 9 m s around f 0 also see lo et al 2005 zhang and ping 2018 therefore broad wavelets with extremely lower amplitudes than the p1 wave may be identified due to the velocity less than 0 1 m s around f 0 also see lo et al 2005 zhang and ping 2018 the p3 wave seems to be trapped at the source zone because of the diffusive character of the slow p waves they cannot be observed effectively at low frequencies the shear wave only can be observed induced by a vertical solid force as theoretically predicted by eqs 67 69 whose energy is mainly transferred in the solid at the velocity around 88 m s see fig 3c furthermore the amplitudes of waves in the fluid pressures and solid displacement appear similar induced by the wetting water and nonwetting air injections however they are different with those induced by the solid force disturbance the time series for the fast waves of an observation station at 10 m 0 m 0 m the triangle in the top panel in fig 1a can further examine this distinctive amplitude contrasts fig 4 we can observe the dynamic fluid injection induces smaller fluid pressures than the solid force meanwhile the corresponding solid displacement responses bear the similar amplitudes under three different source conditions it is caused by the loose unconsolidated sand frame in which the p1 wave is even slower than the acoustic wave in the air 340 m s the stiff fluids mainly hold the pore pressures by their own volumetric strains the fluid injections only are loaded directly by the fluid phases eq 70 the immediate transferred stress is generated by the intense solid deformation for the weak elastic modulus of solid frame which in turn alleviates the fluid deformation making low fluid pressure responses as a result however the solid force actually is loaded by the total stress eq 2 in this case the fluids and solid hold the force disturbance in the solid stress τ 0 i j and the fluid pressures p 1 and p 2 in common the intense solid deformation exerts a positive stress transferring to the fluid pressures unlike the fluid injection cases this also can explain the in phase waveform responses in the fluids and solid under this condition whereas the out phase responses for the fluid injections we can find under different source conditions the relative wave amplitudes in the fluids and solid vary therefore not only the amplitude ratios determined by the orthotropic eigenvectors eqs 43 and 66 also see lo et al 2010 the initial condition must be considered in the traveling wave amplitude estimations as well the shear deformation only appears in the solid phase by the unidirectional solid force without a volumetric strain variation this process does not induce any fluid pressure perturbations therefore in an unsaturated porous medium the shear wave only propagates in the solid frame but attenuated by the fluid and solid viscous couplings see zhang and ping 2018 similar to a saturated medium the fast traveling wave time series are further depicted with different water saturation s 2 induced by a point dynamic water injection fig 5 air injection fig 6 and vertical body force fig 7 the p 2 p 1 and u z are shown in the top middle and bottom panels respectively by the examination of the travel times at the aforementioned station the differences may come from the variation of the densities of the multiphase systems the amplitudes of the p1 wave in the fluid pressures increase with the increment of the water saturation s 2 the stiffness enhancement by the more water content in pore space bears stronger stress responses by the fluid mass sources and solid force perturbations meanwhile the solid displacements grow as the fluid pressures with the increment of s 2 induced by the fluid injections however they decrease induced by the solid force with the increment of s 2 comparing the bottom panels of figs 5 6 and 7 the phenomena can be understood by the one direction transferring from fluid pressures to solid stress under the fluid injections and the accompanied force sustain for fluid pressures and solid stress under the solid force excitation the stiff fluid phase may make strong stress responses in the one directional energy transferring however the stiff fluid phase may bear more force perturbations in the strain energy distribution in a common stress background it also may explain why the shear waves bear low amplitudes with the high s 2 in this case further observation may reveal that with the low s 2 the solid displacement response u z does not increase accordingly from an energetic standpoint under the low s 2 conditions there must be some other procedure takes the external work in the unsaturated immiscible two phase fluids the capillary force p c bears surface energy under different water retention we would do further numerical analysis for more s 2 cases and check the capillary force variations during the wave propagations fig 8 shows the maximum p c recorded under different source conditions the numbers labeled mean the corresponding travel times in second when the maximum p c is observed we can find the monotonic decrement with the s 2 increment induced by the solid force it means during the wave propagation under the low s 2 condition the external work is transferred into the surface energy more effectively which makes the corresponding strain energy decrease both in the fluids and solid when more wetting fluid occupies the pore space the surface energy transition becomes weakened meanwhile it can be inferred that when the wetting fluid fills less pore space due to the external work on both fluid and solid phases the multiphase fluid trends to form menisci contact curvature with bigger contact angle whereas the p c can drive the drops under the external work process and the energy transition is enhanced actually this mechanism is considered to be sufficient also under the large s 2 condition which is observed in the fluid injection cases as exhibits a nonmonotonic concave upward relationship to s 2 however this phenomenon does not occur for the solid force source we deduce that the menisci contact with big contact angle may break up by the joint solid frame and wetting fluid compression in the pore space because of the soft air phase for the fluid injection cases the solid frame does not have the force support these procedures may not be dominant furthermore the difference excitations by the external work makes the p c amplitudes be greatly divergent under these source conditions the p c difference for the two fluid injections reveals the different fluid displacement processes resulting in different contact angle inclinations with possible different multiphase morphologies especially for the low and high wetting fluid saturations 5 discussion and conclusions the nonmonotonic traveling wave signatures under fluid mass sources and solid force perturbations reflect the dynamic responses of an unsaturated medium in which the multiphase fluid and solid couplings are incorporated in a whole mechanical element understanding these spatiotemporal displacement and pressure evolution is crucial for reasonable relating the corresponding observed physical fields to investigate the hydrological process in real soils and rocks using the decompositions of displacement potentials green s functions of corresponding concentrated sources are obtained by solving the decoupled scalar and vector dynamic helmholtz equations derived from unsaturated differential equation containing possible viscous inertial capillary couplings between the different phases beyond the single phase naiver stokes fluid mechanic equations which neglects the direct solid phase responses by equivalent representations of point seismic oscillation and hydrologic fluid dispose using dirac solution of helmholtz functions the time evolution of wave radiations corresponding possible initial excitations in a 3 d dimension medium can be modeled and estimated with different observation geometries with the present solution it is possible to simulate a real wave response under a wide range of initial transient loading conditions and assess the possible observed time domain signals to illuminate the medium properties by further analysis on the traveling waves in a real soil we can identify the four wave modes in spatiotemporal domain which also was previously predicted by dispersion analysis of the unsaturated mode lo et al 2005 lo and sposito 2013 three compressional waves are always observed in all cases and an additional shear wave propagates induced by a unidirectional solid force the p1 wave travels fast with strong amplitude easy to be identified the p2 wave is also propagatory mainly in the fluid phases with extremely low amplitude and difficult to observe in real observations this signal may hide in noise which deservers more clever observation design as those for one phase fluid saturated media e g plona 1980 while this characteristic makes it be not effective in actual field data gathering and analysis the p3 wave bears extremely low velocity therefore it is actually trapped around the source zone representing the singularities of the sources it may be similar to a diffusive process with the nearly equal real and imaginary parts of the wavenumber which is also difficult for actual observations the shear wave only propagates in the solid frame that bears comparatively strong amplitude and a high velocity because of the different fluid solid couplings effects under different source conditions the wave energy in the fluids and solid are distinct the fluid disposes induce lower fluid pressures but comparative solid displacement with the solid seismic source it may be explained by the different excitations into the solid and fluids the solid force is loaded by the total stress of the medium the fluid and solid phases sustain the responses in common meanwhile the fluid dispose mass sources make the volume change in the corresponding fluid phase directly and the solid frame then acquires strain by the pore fluid deformation in the typical soft unconsolidated sands sample the mutual solid fluid coupling and the one way fluid to solid coupling make the wave signatures in the fluid pressures and solid displacement in phase and out phase furthermore the wave radiations enhancement with the wetting fluid saturation s 2 water retention increasing except in the solid frame under solid force perturbations also proves these coupling differences moreover under the low and high s 2 conditions the fluid contact is apt to form small menisci curvature with bigger contact angle bearing stronger capillary force p c and sharing more by the surface energy with a nonmonotonic feature a direct stress reverberated solid frame may enhance this mechanism however when the air becomes babbles high s 2 the interactive two way fluid solid couplings induced by the seismic oscillations may break the balance of this fluid contact due to the extremely compressible air phase understanding these dynamic processes in an unsaturated medium induced by fluid and solid sources can shed light on the complex fluid solid interaction by wiff in pore space in which the energy transition by external work show nonmonotonic characteristics along the traveling waves this analysis could favor practical insight into cooperation the geophysical and

461,the traveling wave responses in an unsaturated medium induced by a solid force and fluid mass sources are derived in 3d green s functions using the dirac delta function decompositions the wave behaviors are described in pore fluid pressures and solid frame displacement along with fluctuations of capillary pressure in response to time variant fluid injections and solid force loadings these solutions are numerically calculated and analyzed for unconsolidated sands as a function of water saturation as representative examples our results reveal and validate four wave modes a fast compressional wave p1 two slow compressional waves p2 and p3 and a shear wave the p1 wave and shear wave can be effectively observed the slow waves with diffusive characters bear low amplitudes and low velocities the traveling waves in the pore fluid pressures and solid displacement are sensitive to the different sources and the water saturation the solid force induces the total stress perturbation while the fluid mass sources directly make the volume strains in the fluid phases this fluid solid coupling difference causes the distinct traveling wave signature contrasts in the pore fluid and solid frame response amplitudes and tendencies with water retention for the variation of water saturation the traveling wave shows a nonmonotonic feature the fluctuation of capillary pressure exhibits a concave upward relationship which can further interpret the changes of wave amplitude with water saturation a solid force may enhance the fluctuation however for high water saturation the interactive fluid solid effect by the solid force may break the fluid contact due to the extremely compressible air key words poroelasticity unsaturated porous media traveling waves 1 introduction the dynamic responses in porous media saturated by two immiscible fluids are phenomena of great importance in a variety of natural engineering and industrial problems including geological co2 sequestration benson and cole 2008 steeb et al 2012 controlled hydraulic fracturing shapiro 2015 hamzehpour et al 2016 and enhanced oil gas recovery deng and cardenas 2013 mason and morrow 2013 karve and kallivokas 2015 a common process in multiphase media is the interaction of fluids and solid which affects the dynamic motions e g the traveling wave generation and propagation the fluid and solid behaviors are governed by the mechanical couplings of capillary force viscous force and inertial force between them this procedure is complicated by the wave induced fluid flows wiff in different pore space scales and consequently the dynamic response pattern in a medium can range from different scales on the traveling wave propagations in porous media containing a single fluid biot 1956 1962 proposed a model to distinguish the solid frame and pore fluid displacement responses via the two phase wave equation by the global viscous fluid and solid coupling the propagation of traveling waves can be estimated by the dynamic impulse responses in the solid and fluid e g norris 1985 boutin 1991 müller 2006 this mechanism is further verified in the rock physics experiment by the existence of the second compressional wave the biot slow p2 wave e g plona 1980 extending approaches based on the biot model were developed to quantitatively account for the effects of partial saturation on the wiff in porous media the coupling in different pore space and saturation must be further depicted e g pride et al 2004 lo et al 2005 beyond the macroscopic fluid solid drag on the dynamic process the problem in describing the impact of immiscible fluids on traveling waves in porous media is to link local flow events and regional cooperative and or competitive wave behaviors actually several researchers are committed to propose reasonable local mechanisms into the upscale framework of the biot model such as double porosity accounting for stiff and compliant pores e g pride et al 2004 ba et al 2016 and patchy saturation for mesoscopic fluid distribution e g johnson 2001 zhang et al 2014 in which the geometry of pore and saturation is considered whereas multiphase fluids in pore space with possible physical couplings may further manifest the actual process by wiff e g santos 1990 lo et al 2005 lo and sposito 2013 which are especially important for near surface hydrogeological occasions partial saturation as occurs routinely in soils in unconsolidated porous media mostly affects the two immiscible fluid motion by the wiff to observe and model these possible coupling among the fluid and solid along traveling wave physical process in pore space is crucial for understanding the fluid mobility and transformation in hydrogeologic formations e g wang 2000 vogler and chrysikopoulos 2002 iassonov and beresnev 2006 elkhoury et al 2006 2011 manga et al 2012 candela et al 2015 lo and lee 2015 stewart and shaw 2015 hasanov et al 2019 therefore to further establish theories that accounts to the two phase fluids with any saturation process can be benefit to further investigation on the complex phenomena of multiphase interactions in unsaturated media whose framework can be resorted to mixture theory e g coussy 2004 garg and nayfeh 1986 tuncay and corapcioglu 1996 as well as wei and muraleetharan 2002 considered the viscous drag by velocity differences between the fluids and solid using parameter averaging and dynamical consistency berryman et al 1998 further took the inertia drag into account by different accelerations between the phases however they imposed an assumption of the constant capillary pressure gradient between the fluid phases during the wave propagations santos et al 1990 firstly constructed a lagrangian model to describe the acoustic waves in porous media containing two immiscible fluids one nonwetting and one wetting air and water that accounts for the fluctuations in capillary pressure viscous and inertial drags in the dynamic responses with volume fractions and coupling mass densities lo et al 2005 as well as lo and sposito 2013 further illustrated possible mechanisms accounting for different velocity and accelerations among the multiphases in a comprehensive eulerian model for acoustic wave behaviors with closed relation of linearized increment of fluid content and porosity despite the growing importance of dynamic coupled wiff in pore under fluid and solid mechanical framework many aspects remain poorly understood one of the fundamental unresolved problems is the definite description the induced displacement and pore pressure evolution in presence of the solid and fluid contacts by wiff seismic oscillation or fluid disposal induces changes in the states both of stress and pressure that can affect the behaviors of the material however the focus of the previous work is mainly on the plane harmonic wave analysis for frequency dependent dispersion and attenuation prediction of wave modes although three compressional waves the p1 wave similar to p wave in elastic media and p1 wave in fluid saturated media e g zhang and ping 2018 and two slow waves the p2 wave corresponding to the biot slow wave and the p3 wave are predicted how they travel through a medium in a time scale measurement is not well understood other than the wave mode analysis the traveling wave effects depend on the initial state of stress fluid content and properties of the hydrogeological formations which are not intuitively obvious and should be further quantified using the unsaturated porous models however there are not many dynamic solutions namely green s function of boundary value problem for the unsaturated differential equation under a concentrated source which is singular at the source location available to further present and illustrate the actual spatiotemporal excitations and responses for the traveling waves yet is very fundamental and powerful in geophysical and hydrological application scenarios e g pan 2019 to obtain and analyze the solutions can help further understand and interpret the actual coupling behaviors observed in unsaturated media in the present work the solution of a three dimensional 3 d medium with possible solid and fluid initial conditions are deduced based on the immiscible fluid saturation in pore space accounting for capillary pressure fluctuation viscous and inertial force fingerings by wiff the fundamental solution is obtained in the frequency domain and the helmholtz decomposition method is chosen to obtain the spatiotemporal solutions we try to shed light on the displacement and pore pressure evolution under seismic and hydrological excitations in particular in scenario whereas the multi wave modes coexist in a unite physical process although we can estimate these perturbations by different velocity estimations but how large is the magnitude of different wave modes meanwhile the analysis performed under various sources will present the wave energy distribution in solid and fluids along with propagations a question also arises that how certain wave radiation patterns appear similar or diverse we choose the material data of unconsolidated sands for example the dynamic fluid mass sources and a solid force inducing the nonmonotonic traveling waves in fluid pressures and solid displacements is discovered as one of the significances of biot s poroelasticity the four traveling waves are identified and analyzed by spatiotemporal observations three compressional waves and one shear wave the p1 wave is propagatory with large amplitude while the p2 wave shows a strongly dispersive character and extremely weak responses mainly in the fluid pressures as the biot slow wave an additional p3 wave also emerges due to the existence of the second porous fluid which is trapped by the sources with extremely low velocity furthermore we also realize the wave behaviors on the variation of saturation process nonmonotonic traveling wave effects on the capillary will be further identified in these special cases finally the results and potential physical explanations in the light of the questions posed above are discussed and concluded in the last part 2 theory 2 1 an unsaturated model the pore pressure pf in a general unified pore space for a two immiscible fluid flow in a deformable porous

regarded as green s functions of solid and fluid displacements at the field point r due to the solid force source at r 0 noting that the dirac function can be written as 27 δ r r 0 n n 4 π 2 1 r 1 4 π

phase fluids can be written as 70 ζ j w j γ j j 1 2 where ζ j is the variation of fluid volume per unit reference volume and w j is the relative fluid displacement as in fluid saturated media e g biot 1962 respectively which is defined as 71 w j ϕ s j u j u 0 the fluid source represented in a time dependent strength f t located at r 0 can be given using the convolution as 72 γ j f j t δ r r 0 the fluid sources also can be regarded as the inhomogeneous terms at the rhs of wave equations 6 8 using the constituent relation of eqs 3 4 and 5 lo et al 2005 these terms are written as for eq 6 73 ξ 1

nonwetting fluid source for example only the terms for γ 1 are kept the corresponding displacements can also be represented in the frequency domain as 76 u 0 r ω g 0 nw r r 0 ω f 1 ω 77 u 1 r ω g 1 nw

helmholtz equation as 79 δ r r 0 2 e ikr 4 π r k 2 e ikr 4 π r the green s functions can be decomposed in a similar manner as 80 g 0 nw φ 0 1 ψ 0 1 81 g 1 nw φ 1 1 ψ 1 1 82 g 2 nw φ 2 1 ψ 2 1 we can further observe the wave equations contain only divergence fields using the abovementioned potentials hence the curl parts of vector potentials are identically zero in can be inferred that the fluid source does not generate shear deformations the obtained scalar potential equation can be written as 83 c φ 1 i i d φ 1 t t b φ 1 t h where φ 1 φ 0 1 φ 1 1 φ 2 1 t and h is the fluid source vector

corresponding green s functions g j w r r 0 ω j 0 1 2 due to the wetting fluid source can be obtained in the similar way we can see that the dynamic green s functions induced by fluid sources contain only compressional motions the fluid pressure impulse perturbations are also given in appendix b 4 analysis of traveling wave solution the traveling waves can be induced by the different sources as indicated in eqs 23 and 72 we assume the source locate at 5 m 0 m 5 m in a cartesian coordinate the source time function is set as a dynamic process depicted as the ricker wavelet zhang et al 2012 109 f t f 0 1 2 π 2 f 0 2 t 2 exp π 2 f 0 2 t 2 where f 0 is the dominant frequency and f 0 is the amplitude as a scale ratio representing the force and fluid injection magnitude we chose the f 0 50 hz and f 0 1000 for the following discussion the medium properties are listed in table 1 as typical sands rawls et al 1992 lo et al 2007 figs 1 2 and 3 show the traveling waves in the xoz plane with y 0 m that are induced by a dynamic point water injection a an air injection c and a vertical body force c in the water pressure p 2 gas pressure p 1 and vertical solid displacement u z respectively each row shows the waveform snapshots at the corresponding travel time labeled at the left panel by spatial grid 800 400 solution calculations noting the different amplitude scales three compressional waveforms can be identified as the previous plane wave predictions e g lo et al 2005 zhang and ping 2018 the p1 wave travels in the fluids and solid at 177 m s around f 0 the p2 wave travels mainly in the fluids the corresponding responses in the solid are not conspicuous see fig 3 the p2 wave velocity can vary from 2 m s to 9 m s around f 0 also see lo et al 2005 zhang and ping 2018 therefore broad wavelets with extremely lower amplitudes than the p1 wave may be identified due to the velocity less than 0 1 m s around f 0 also see lo et al 2005 zhang and ping 2018 the p3 wave seems to be trapped at the source zone because of the diffusive character of the slow p waves they cannot be observed effectively at low frequencies the shear wave only can be observed induced by a vertical solid force as theoretically predicted by eqs 67 69 whose energy is mainly transferred in the solid at the velocity around 88 m s see fig 3c furthermore the amplitudes of waves in the fluid pressures and solid displacement appear similar induced by the wetting water and nonwetting air injections however they are different with those induced by the solid force disturbance the time series for the fast waves of an observation station at 10 m 0 m 0 m the triangle in the top panel in fig 1a can further examine this distinctive amplitude contrasts fig 4 we can observe the dynamic fluid injection induces smaller fluid pressures than the solid force meanwhile the corresponding solid displacement responses bear the similar amplitudes under three different source conditions it is caused by the loose unconsolidated sand frame in which the p1 wave is even slower than the acoustic wave in the air 340 m s the stiff fluids mainly hold the pore pressures by their own volumetric strains the fluid injections only are loaded directly by the fluid phases eq 70 the immediate transferred stress is generated by the intense solid deformation for the weak elastic modulus of solid frame which in turn alleviates the fluid deformation making low fluid pressure responses as a result however the solid force actually is loaded by the total stress eq 2 in this case the fluids and solid hold the force disturbance in the solid stress τ 0 i j and the fluid pressures p 1 and p 2 in common the intense solid deformation exerts a positive stress transferring to the fluid pressures unlike the fluid injection cases this also can explain the in phase waveform responses in the fluids and solid under this condition whereas the out phase responses for the fluid injections we can find under different source conditions the relative wave amplitudes in the fluids and solid vary therefore not only the amplitude ratios determined by the orthotropic eigenvectors eqs 43 and 66 also see lo et al 2010 the initial condition must be considered in the traveling wave amplitude estimations as well the shear deformation only appears in the solid phase by the unidirectional solid force without a volumetric strain variation this process does not induce any fluid pressure perturbations therefore in an unsaturated porous medium the shear wave only propagates in the solid frame but attenuated by the fluid and solid viscous couplings see zhang and ping 2018 similar to a saturated medium the fast traveling wave time series are further depicted with different water saturation s 2 induced by a point dynamic water injection fig 5 air injection fig 6 and vertical body force fig 7 the p 2 p 1 and u z are shown in the top middle and bottom panels respectively by the examination of the travel times at the aforementioned station the differences may come from the variation of the densities of the multiphase systems the amplitudes of the p1 wave in the fluid pressures increase with the increment of the water saturation s 2 the stiffness enhancement by the more water content in pore space bears stronger stress responses by the fluid mass sources and solid force perturbations meanwhile the solid displacements grow as the fluid pressures with the increment of s 2 induced by the fluid injections however they decrease induced by the solid force with the increment of s 2 comparing the bottom panels of figs 5 6 and 7 the phenomena can be understood by the one direction transferring from fluid pressures to solid stress under the fluid injections and the accompanied force sustain for fluid pressures and solid stress under the solid force excitation the stiff fluid phase may make strong stress responses in the one directional energy transferring however the stiff fluid phase may bear more force perturbations in the strain energy distribution in a common stress background it also may explain why the shear waves bear low amplitudes with the high s 2 in this case further observation may reveal that with the low s 2 the solid displacement response u z does not increase accordingly from an energetic standpoint under the low s 2 conditions there must be some other procedure takes the external work in the unsaturated immiscible two phase fluids the capillary force p c bears surface energy under different water retention we would do further numerical analysis for more s 2 cases and check the capillary force variations during the wave propagations fig 8 shows the maximum p c recorded under different source conditions the numbers labeled mean the corresponding travel times in second when the maximum p c is observed we can find the monotonic decrement with the s 2 increment induced by the solid force it means during the wave propagation under the low s 2 condition the external work is transferred into the surface energy more effectively which makes the corresponding strain energy decrease both in the fluids and solid when more wetting fluid occupies the pore space the surface energy transition becomes weakened meanwhile it can be inferred that when the wetting fluid fills less pore space due to the external work on both fluid and solid phases the multiphase fluid trends to form menisci contact curvature with bigger contact angle whereas the p c can drive the drops under the external work process and the energy transition is enhanced actually this mechanism is considered to be sufficient also under the large s 2 condition which is observed in the fluid injection cases as exhibits a nonmonotonic concave upward relationship to s 2 however this phenomenon does not occur for the solid force source we deduce that the menisci contact with big contact angle may break up by the joint solid frame and wetting fluid compression in the pore space because of the soft air phase for the fluid injection cases the solid frame does not have the force support these procedures may not be dominant furthermore the difference excitations by the external work makes the p c amplitudes be greatly divergent under these source conditions the p c difference for the two fluid injections reveals the different fluid displacement processes resulting in different contact angle inclinations with possible different multiphase morphologies especially for the low and high wetting fluid saturations 5 discussion and conclusions the nonmonotonic traveling wave signatures under fluid mass sources and solid force perturbations reflect the dynamic responses of an unsaturated medium in which the multiphase fluid and solid couplings are incorporated in a whole mechanical element understanding these spatiotemporal displacement and pressure evolution is crucial for reasonable relating the corresponding observed physical fields to investigate the hydrological process in real soils and rocks using the decompositions of displacement potentials green s functions of corresponding concentrated sources are obtained by solving the decoupled scalar and vector dynamic helmholtz equations derived from unsaturated differential equation containing possible viscous inertial capillary couplings between the different phases beyond the single phase naiver stokes fluid mechanic equations which neglects the direct solid phase responses by equivalent representations of point seismic oscillation and hydrologic fluid dispose using dirac solution of helmholtz functions the time evolution of wave radiations corresponding possible initial excitations in a 3 d dimension medium can be modeled and estimated with different observation geometries with the present solution it is possible to simulate a real wave response under a wide range of initial transient loading conditions and assess the possible observed time domain signals to illuminate the medium properties by further analysis on the traveling waves in a real soil we can identify the four wave modes in spatiotemporal domain which also was previously predicted by dispersion analysis of the unsaturated mode lo et al 2005 lo and sposito 2013 three compressional waves are always observed in all cases and an additional shear wave propagates induced by a unidirectional solid force the p1 wave travels fast with strong amplitude easy to be identified the p2 wave is also propagatory mainly in the fluid phases with extremely low amplitude and difficult to observe in real observations this signal may hide in noise which deservers more clever observation design as those for one phase fluid saturated media e g plona 1980 while this characteristic makes it be not effective in actual field data gathering and analysis the p3 wave bears extremely low velocity therefore it is actually trapped around the source zone representing the singularities of the sources it may be similar to a diffusive process with the nearly equal real and imaginary parts of the wavenumber which is also difficult for actual observations the shear wave only propagates in the solid frame that bears comparatively strong amplitude and a high velocity because of the different fluid solid couplings effects under different source conditions the wave energy in the fluids and solid are distinct the fluid disposes induce lower fluid pressures but comparative solid displacement with the solid seismic source it may be explained by the different excitations into the solid and fluids the solid force is loaded by the total stress of the medium the fluid and solid phases sustain the responses in common meanwhile the fluid dispose mass sources make the volume change in the corresponding fluid phase directly and the solid frame then acquires strain by the pore fluid deformation in the typical soft unconsolidated sands sample the mutual solid fluid coupling and the one way fluid to solid coupling make the wave signatures in the fluid pressures and solid displacement in phase and out phase furthermore the wave radiations enhancement with the wetting fluid saturation s 2 water retention increasing except in the solid frame under solid force perturbations also proves these coupling differences moreover under the low and high s 2 conditions the fluid contact is apt to form small menisci curvature with bigger contact angle bearing stronger capillary force p c and sharing more by the surface energy with a nonmonotonic feature a direct stress reverberated solid frame may enhance this mechanism however when the air becomes babbles high s 2 the interactive two way fluid solid couplings induced by the seismic oscillations may break the balance of this fluid contact due to the extremely compressible air phase understanding these dynamic processes in an unsaturated medium induced by fluid and solid sources can shed light on the complex fluid solid interaction by wiff in pore space in which the energy transition by external work show nonmonotonic characteristics along the traveling waves this analysis could favor practical insight into cooperation the geophysical and

462,in this work a grain scale modelling technique is introduced for the simulation of unsaturated flow in deforming and swelling granular materials to do so a pore scale model for unsaturated flow is coupled to the discrete element method dem it is assumed that initially a dry packing of particles is quickly invaded by a liquid and becomes fully saturated particles start absorbing the liquid and this causes a rearrangement of particles entrance of air into the packing and a redistribution of the liquid i e unsaturated flow flow was computed using a scheme of implicit pressure solver and explicit saturation update impes whilst particle movement was modelled using dem simulations are continued until the packing is dry again this is the first time that such a pore scale model has been developed we have used the model to investigate unsaturated flow during drying of a bed of swelling particles results indicated that the characteristic time scales of unsaturated flow and water absorption determine the swelling behaviour of the particle packing keywords swelling particles grain scale model dem unsaturated flow 1 introduction unsaturated flow in swelling porous materials poses an intricate and highly coupled problem swelling not only causes deformation of the solid phase and rearrangement of grains but also affects the distribution of the liquid inside the pores which subsequently affects the swelling of the solid phase for example a coal bed may swell due to injection and subsequent adsorption of co2 inside the coal matrix which causes an increase in internal stress and a subsequent decrease in permeability espinoz et al 2014 pan et al 2012 and references therein but the decrease in permeability inhibits the usage of coal bed for further carbon sequestration swelling of porous materials also occurs in anthropogenic materials such hydrophilic binders inside the coating layer of paper during ink injection see e g lamminmäki et al 2012 the swelling of potatoes during frying takhar 2014 and the swelling of starch in food e g tester and morrison 1990 yeh and li 1996 in this work the focus is on swelling of a bed of super absorbent polymer sap particles which are used in hygienic products sap particles can absorb distilled water up to 1000 times their initial weight and up to 40 times of a fluid having a physiological salinity e g graham and wilson 1998 and references therein the swelling of an individual sap particle is a complex process it includes fluid transport into the polymer framework of particle ion redistribution inside the polymer framework bertrand et al 2016 yu et al 2017 huyghe and janssen 1997 an expanding particle boundary radu et al 2002 sweijen et al 2017b as well as the cracking of surface of an initially dry sap particle ding et al 2018 the swelling of a bed of sap particles is not only controlled by the swelling of individual particles but also by processes occurring within the pores of the particle bed diersch et al 2010 sweijen et al 2017a swelling of porous materials is a specific case of hydromechanical coupling that in general involves the coupling of deformation of the porous solid and liquid flow inside its pores to characterize hydromechanical coupling macro scale models have been developed that describe both deformation and unsaturated flow however the constitutive relations in such models are still being debated in particular the dependency of effective stress on capillary pressure and interfacial area e g in bishop s equation cf nikooee et al 2013 huyghe et al 2017 in addition macro scale models entail many dependencies that must be identified prior to simulations for example hydraulic parameters such as relative permeability and capillary pressure saturation curves depend on the state of stress of a porous material which has been shown experimentally see e g nuth and laloui 2008 salager et al 2013 oh and lu 2014 tavakoli dastjerdi et al 2014 and numerically see e g rostami et al 2015 sweijen et al 2016 milatz and grabe 2019 studied the relation of unsaturated flow with shearing of a grain skeleton of sand using ct imaging their study gave insight in the dependency of e g interfacial area of air and water on strain for swelling materials there are more constitutive equations required such as the effect of water saturation on the swelling rate and the effect of swelling rate on water pressure inside the porous material see e g diersch et al 2010 experimental characterization of swelling materials is complex which is particularly true for swelling of sap particles the swelling and deformation are large and the period is short typically sap absorbs 40 times its initial weight within 5 to 10 minutes e g kabiri et al 2003 an alternative to experiments would be to conduct pore scale modelling based on pore scale physics and rules there is a huge literature on pore network models for the description of two phase flow and transport in granular porous media see e g el zehairy et al 2019 molnar et al 2019 joekar niasar et al 2010 raoof and hassanizadeh 2010 in pore network models the pore space is explicitly reconstructed and one can account for pore sizes shape topology and connectivity even possible changes of the pore space as a result of dissolution precipitation wolterbeek and raoof 2018 or biofilm growth have been included qin and hassanizadeh 2015 however in pore network models one cannot explicitly take into account the shape of grains their movement and deformation or temporal changes in shape and size a suitable grain scale model for simulating deformation of particle packing s is the discrete element method dem which is capable of computing the movements of individual particles during deformation inside a 3 dimensional packing of particles cundall and strack 1979 dem has previously been coupled to a pore network by kharaghani et al 2011 to study mechanical effects during drying dem can also be coupled with the pore finite volume pfv method to simulate a number of different processes such as i saturated flow inside deforming packings of spheres chareyre et al 2012 catalano et al 2014 ii fluidization of a bed of particles montellà et al 2016 and iii erosion of a particle bed hosn et al 2019 dem has also been coupled to the pore unit assembly pua method which subdivides the pore geometry into pore units and pore throats using the coupling of dem with pua capillary pressure saturation curves have been constructed for a large variety of particle packing s to study soil water retention curves yuan et al 2015 mahmoodlu et al 2016 sweijen et al 2016 thus using dem with either pfv or pua allows for pore scale simulations of the coupling between deformation and fluid flow or capillarity this yields insight into complex 3 dimensional processes of particle rearrangement and fluid flow inside granular materials which otherwise would be difficult to study experimentally see for example the comprehensive experimental work of macminn et al 2015 on 2 dimensional particle rearrangement due to fluid flow recently sweijen et al 2018 coupled dem to a pore scale model for unsaturated flow they developed a pore scale model using impes implicit pressure and explicit saturation scheme which was based on pua and could simulate dynamic drainage inside a rigid packing of spheres thus not allowing for deformation that work combines two phase flow algorithms originating from pore network models see e g thompson 2002 and joekar niasar et al 2010 with the concept of pore unit assembly in the present work the dynamic code of sweijen et al 2018 is extended to include large swelling of grains due to water absorption their subsequent deformation and the change of pore space this is the first grain scale model that is capable of simulating unsaturated flow in an packing of highly swelling grains the aim is to study swelling of a sap particle bed and the subsequent drying or drainage of the pore space to do so we have the following objectives i to develop a pore scale model that can simulate unsaturated flow in deforming porous materials by extending the coupling of dem and pua and include deformation ii to identify processes that occur during drainage and swelling of sap particle beds and to identify their characteristic time scales iii to study a rigid packing of swelling particles iv to study the effect of swelling rate of individual particles on the swelling behaviour a bed of particles these objectives are tested on a virtual particle bed of sap particles inside a beaker glass the packing is initially saturated with water the sap particles will start to swell and absorb water whilst air will move into the particle packing from above when the initial volume of water is absorbed the particle packing will stop swelling 2 numerical methods the simulation framework we use is the open source software yade which is a 3 dimensional numerical model based on the discrete element method dem šmilauer et al 2015 in that framework sweijen et al 2018 previously added the pore unit assembly method to enable unsaturated flow inside particle packings in this approach an assembly of pore units is generated based on the particle locations in dem using that assembly unsaturated flow has been simulated for non deforming assemblies of particles in what follows we extend the pore unit assembly method to enable simulation of unsaturated flow and deformation thus allowing for coupled calculations of unsaturated flow and particle movements following dem for simplification in dem calculations for determining the movement of grains we do not include forces exerted on particles by pore fluids air and or water the physical meaning of this assumption is that capillary and viscous forces which act on particles do not affect the movement of particles in future work adding forces that arise from the occupancy of pore units by water and water can relax this assumption following the work byyuan and chareyre 2017 2 1 determining the pore unit assembly in order to allow for coupling of dem simulations with unsaturated flow a meshing algorithm is employed that extracts a pore unit assembly out of the particle configuration sweijen et al 2018 introduced the meshing algorithm and a short summary is given here see also fig 1 the lowest level of meshing is that of the particle centres which is dependent on the state of stress inside the particle packing and which is determined by dem the particle centres determine the intermediate level of meshing which is that of grain based tetrahedra each grain based tetrahedron has its vertices on the particle centres this method relies on triangulation of the particle packing and was implemented into yade by chareyre et al 2012 and catalano et al 2014 each tetrahedron encloses a pore space that is replaced by regular shape for sake of simplifying the pore geometry when multiple tetrahedra enclose a single pore space the tetrahedra are merged and replaced by a different regular shape see for more detail sweijen et al 2018 the assembly of regular shapes is the highest level of meshing referred to as an assembly of pore units regular shapes are for example tetrahedra cubes octahedra each regular shape is assumed to have its corners wedged into the pore throats of the particle packing since regular shapes have a known geometry a library of geometrical constants are determined that describe the relation between capillary pressure p i c and saturation si within each pore unit the equation for p i c was initially defined by joekar niasar et al 2010 for cubical pore units and extended for various shapes by sweijen et al 2018 1 p i c 2 γ χ v i 3 1 e κ s i where γ is the surface tension of air water χ and κ are geometrical constants and vi is the volume of a pore unit in addition to the capillary pressure inside a pore unit an entry criterium is imposed for air to invade a saturated pore unit j from a neighbouring pore unit i the entry pressure of pore throat ij needs to be overcome the entry criteria are implemented in sweijen et al 2018 and entails p a i r p j w 2 γ r i j with rij being the effective radius of pore throat ij thus the pore unit assembly describes the connectivity of pore units among each other the size of pore units the size of pore throats and the capillary pressure saturation relations within each pore unit this assembly is then used to model unsaturated flow to achieve hydro mechanical coupling changes in particle locations are directly projected to the grain based tetrahedra and subsequently to the pore unit assembly the numerical procedure contains the following three computational steps for every time step see fig 2 i update of particle locations using dem ii update of the local capillary pressure saturation curve and pore throat entry pressures iii computation of unsaturated flow thus first a time step is made by dem to go from time t to time t δt then flow computations are conducted to compute the water pressure and saturation at time t δt in what follows the algorithm to compute unsaturated flow is explained 2 2 change of pore unit volume due to particle movement unsaturated flow is computed by an impes scheme implicit pressure solver and an explicit saturation update as implemented into yade by sweijen et al 2018 consider a pore unit i that has a volume vi the change in pore unit volume d v i d t is the sum of volume change due to swelling of the surrounding particles d v i d t a b s and volume change due to the relative movement of particles d v i d t m o v see fig 3 thus we have following sweijen et al 2017b 2 d v i d t d v i d t m o v d v i d t a b s the value of d v i d t a b s is always negative during swelling and it is determined using the swelling rate of the enclosing particles which is further discussed in section 3 1 here the change of particle volume is assumed to be equal to the volume of absorbed water as the mass density of swollen particles is almost the same as the water density we can assume that the change in pore unit volume due to water absorption by sap particles is equal to the absorbed water volume so this change does not directly cause flow of water since water is simply changed from being in a liquid state to a solid state i e absorbed into the sap particle but a subsequent movement of particles will cause a change in void volume which can cause movement of water therefore the flux d v i d t m o v is considered when solving for pressure while d v i d t a b s is only considered when updating the water saturation the volume change terms in eq 1 are determined at time step t δt based on the change in volume of the pore unit due to particle movement as well as swelling using dem 2 3 computation of unsaturated flow in this section the governing equations of flow in deforming pore units are provided consider pore unit i that has a water pressure pi a water saturation si and it is connected to neighbouring pore unit j via pore throat ij that has a conductivity kij the volume balance for saturated pore units reads 3 j 1 n i k i j p i p j d v i d t m o v chareyre et al 2012 and catalano et al 2014 have previously implemented eq 3 to solve for water pressure in saturated pore units in a deforming non swelling granular material for partially saturated pore units the following discretized volume balance holds 4 j 1 n i k i j p i t δ t p j t δ t d v i s i d t m o v t δ t eq 4 is non linear as kij depends on the presence of air in pore units i and j as well as their capillary pressure for more details see sweijen et al 2018 in addition si depends on pi contributing to the non linearity of eq 4 therefore it requires simplifications before we can solve it for water pressure the right hand side of eq 4 is discretized into 5 d v i s i d t m o v t δ t s i t δ t v i t δ t s i t v i t δ t the value of d v i d t m o v is already known at time step t δt from dem computations as explained above therefore the term v i t t is determined as follows 6 v i t δ t v i t d v i d t m o v t δ t δ t next we introduce the following linearization to solve for saturation inside a pore unit 7 s i t δ t s i t d s i d p i t d p i d t t δ t δ t where d s i d p i is the derivative of the local capillary pressure saturation curve of each pore unit see eq 1 the value of d s i d p i is evaluated at time step t after combining eqs 5 to 7 we have 8 d v i s i w d t m o v t δ t s i t d v i d t m o v t δ t v i t d v i d t m o v t δ t δ t d s i d p i t d p i d t t δ t in eq 8 d p i d t t δ t can be rewritten as p i t δ t p i t δ t combining eqs 4 and 8 and rearranging various terms yields 9 p i t δ t j 1 n i k i j t v i t δ t d v i d t m o v t δ t d s i d p i t j 1 n i k i j t p j t δ t s i t d v i d t m o v t δ t v i t δ t d v i d t m o v t δ t d s i d p i t p i t eqs 4 and 9 constitute a set of linear equations that have the following form 10 a p i t δ t j 0 n i b p j t δ t c where a b and c are coefficients independent of p i t t eq 10 can be solved for water pressure note that the change of pore unit volume due to particle movement d v i d t m o v is obtained from dem simulations eq 10 simplifies into eq 1 for saturated pore units which makes eq 10 applicable to saturated and unsaturated pore units after obtaining p i t t the saturation is explicitly updated while accounting for the water absorption by the swelling particles 11 s i t δ t s i t d s i d p i p i w t δ t p i w t δ t v i t δ t d v i d t a b s 3 model setup 3 1 discrete element method setup the discrete element method was setup following previous work of the authors sweijen et al 2017a where the swelling behaviour of a saturated sap particle bed was modelled and tested against experiments in that work the contact mechanics between the swelling particles is described by hertz mindlin contact mechanics see modenese et al 2012 for more details for its implementation contact mechanics in dem are based on normal displacement between particles that results in a force where the normal displacement is conceptualized as an overlap between two spherical particles all particles were assumed to have a constant young s modulus of 10 kpa the particle particle friction angle was set to 5 5 lorenz et al 1997 and the density was set to 1000 kg m 3 mirnyy et al 2012 all particles had an initial diameter of 460µm prior to swelling simulations a packing of dry sap particles was generated first 3000 particles were placed into a relatively large cubic modelling domain 10³ mm³ in such a relatively large domain the particles do not form a tight packing and porosity is very large then the particles were compacted by applying an artificial 10 pa confining stress to all boundaries of the modelling domain reducing the domain size significantly this resulted in a porosity value of 0 38 and a domain size of 5 4³ mm³ the permeability of the dry sap particle packing was determined using a virtual permeability test in yade dem the permeability was found to be 4 8 10 10 m2 once a packing of dry sap particles was generated the boundary conditions were set to the conditions described in the following section after the particle packing was generated the swelling simulations could commence the swelling of particles was simulated by simply increasing all particle sizes over time using a growth factor following sweijen et al 2017a a simple kinetic law was used to describe the change of radius as a function of time although more complex and comprehensive models exist for swelling of spherical particle huyghe and jansen 1997 radu et al 2002 sweijen et al 2017b here we employed the kinetic law proposed by omidian et al 1998 with an additional factor to account for partial wetting of the particle surface under unsaturated conditions following diersch et al 2010 12 d r x d t f w k 0 r x m a x r x where k 0 is a kinetic coefficient fw is the fraction of the wetted surface of a particle rx is the radius rmax is the maximum radius the fraction fw is the ratio of the surface area of particle x that is in contact with water and the total surface area of particle x the maximum radius was set to 3 6r 0 where r 0 was the initial radius this corresponded to an absorption ratio of 30 g g furthermore the swelling rate is expressed as a dimensionless group 1 k 0 r 0 d r d t where r is the arithmetic mean of radii of all particle eq 12 plays an important role in the coupling of dem with the model for unsaturated flow if a particle is surrounded by empty pores its swelling rate converges to zero if a particle is only surrounded by fully saturated pore units its swelling rate is at a maximum value but still dependent on its radius and initial radius the wetted surface area of a particle is based on the saturation of the surrounding pore units if a pore unit is empty saturation lower than 10 6 the solid surface area in that pore unit is dry otherwise it is considered wet 3 2 initial and boundary conditions in this study we simulate a one direction swelling experiment in a box similar to swelling of particles in a beaker glass the side walls and the bottom of the box are fixed and the top boundary is free to move see figure 4 all boundaries are no flow boundary conditions to water and only via the top boundary air can enter into the particle packing we assume that at the start of the experiment the bed of sap particles becomes saturated quickly without any significant swelling as a result the particle bed is fully saturated except for the pore units along the top boundary which are partially saturated with air at an initial capillary pressure of 2500 pa the initial volume of water inside the pores in between the particles is the only available water for swelling throughout the simulation note that sap particles are considered non porous themselves and thus initially do not contain any water after the initial conditions the particles start to absorb water and swell and the particle packing will increase in height eventually the particle bed dries out and swelling will cease 3 3 different regimes in the coupling of unsaturated flow swelling and particle movement three different processes govern unsaturated flow inside the pore space of a swelling particle bed with each process having its own characteristic time step namely unsaturated flow τ flow water absorption τ abs and deformation τ def the magnitude of the characteristic times will give insight into the behaviour of the particle packing therefore we introduce the characteristic times and their effect on the overall swelling behaviour of a bed of particles the characteristic time of water absorption τ abs is based on eq 12 such that 13 τ a b s r i m a x r i d r i d t 1 f w k 0 now if we define fw to be the fraction of wetted surface of all particles in the packing then the second part of eq 13 is used to determine characteristic time for swelling of the whole particle packing the characteristic time for unsaturated flow τ flow is given as 14 τ f l o w l v l μ ρ w g k μ d x k d p where μ is the viscosity of water l is the length of the modelling domain ρ w is the density of water g is the gravitational constant q is the darcy flux k is the intrinsic permeability of the modelling domain and d p d x is the pressure gradient in water finally we introduce the time scale for deformation which is based on the relaxation time required for a contact to dissipate its potential energy 15 τ d e f r 2 ρ e in which e is the young s modulus of the particles ρ is the particle density assumed to be 1 g cm 3 and r is the average particle diameter to illustrate the effect of three characteristic times on the overall swelling behaviour we define the following ratios of time scales 16 τ f l o w τ a b s l μ f w k 0 ρ w g k 1 15 s f w k 0 17 τ d e f τ a b s d 50 f w k 0 2 ρ e 7 3 10 5 s f w k 0 18 τ f l o w τ d e f 2 l μ ρ w g k d 50 ρ e 1 6 10 4 using eqs 16 18 we can identify the following cases which are also illustrated in fig 5 i τ flow τ abs water residing inside the pores can find equilibrium very fast and thus dynamic effects of unsaturated flow will be short lived therefore unsaturated flow can be simulated using a quasi static capillarity model rather than a dynamic code ii τ flow τ abs water exchange among pores is slow and thus the swelling rate may be strongly affected by the lack of water inside the particle packing which might cause suction inside the particle packing even when it is saturated iii τ def τ abs the particle particle contact points can dissipate their potential energy quickly in practise τ def is always smaller than τ abs and thus particle movement can keep up with the deformation iv τ def τ abs swelling is much faster than that particle contacts can dissipate their potential energy therefore particle movement will be limited and the particle packing will clog i e the porosity will tend to zero this scenario will be similar to swelling of a bed of particles inside a rigid box where particle movement will also be restricted v τ flow τ def water residing inside the pores can find equilibrium very fast and thus dynamic effects will be short lived vi τ flow τ def particle contacts can dissipate their energy quickly and thus the flow of water will be dominating the kinetics of particle movement for swelling sap particles we have τ f l o w τ d e f 1 and τ d e f τ a b s 1 indicating that the relaxation of particle contacts occurs fast compared to flow and water absorption processes nevertheless we consider one scenario simulation 1 where particles are not allowed to move i e τ def in addition we conduct three simulations for varying values of k 0 starting from 0 1 to 10 s 1 simulation 2 to 4 which varies τ f l o w τ a b s from 0 115 to 11 5 thus the value of τ f l o w τ a b s at the initial state of swelling is around unity which implicates that swelling and unsaturated flow have similar time scales lastly we consider a hypothetical packing where no swelling occurs i e τ abs simulation 5 and thus nothing happens because particle locations do not change and all pores remain saturated the characteristic times steps are summarize in table 1 in practise the value of τ f l o w τ a b s is in the order of 10 based on the experimental work by mirnyy et al 2013 where we have k 0 5 10 3 s 1 l 0 20 m mirnyy et al 2013 k 10 11 m 2 diersch et al 2011 this implies that the experimental work by mirnyy et al 2013 is best represented by simulation 4 which has τ f l o w τ a b s equal to 11 5 3 4 mechanical considerations as mentioned earlier we made some assumptions regarding the mechanics of particles and the packing first forces on the particles exerted by the surrounding fluids i e air and or water were not included as the water pressure in the packing would be smaller than the air pressure the particle packing would in experiments be more compressed by the suction of water secondly the particles are assumed to keep their initial spherical shape during swelling thus particles cannot grow into available pore space which implies that case iv of section 3 3 cannot be modelled using our code in real sap particle packings we may have plastic deformation of particles and a change of their shape whilst our code assumes that normal displacement at particle contacts is purely a reversible deformation 3 5 mass balance of the simulations the coupling of unsaturated flow with dem requires two mass balances in order to verify the quality of the numerical simulations firstly modelling of unsaturated flow requires a mass balance on its own for solving eqs 10 and 11 the mass balance is verified at each time step and the accumulative error is registered over time from these analysis it follows that locally at each time step mass is conserved with the inclusion of very small truncation loss of saturation at saturations of lower than 10 6 the accumulative error is largest for simulation 1 with 0 2 which was a result of the rigid packing in which porosity tends to zero secondly there is a mass balance of the coupling between unsaturated flow and dem which is mostly affected by the normal displacement at particle contacts the larger the normal displacement the larger the error in mass balance becomes thus with larger values of τ f l o w τ a b s the error increases from an accumulative error in water balance from 1 simulation 2 to 8 simulation 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 the swelling of a rigid packing in simulation 1 the particle locations are fixed in order to study the swelling of a rigid packing this scenario is purely hypothetical but would be similar to swelling particles inside a rigid box in theory the saturation inside the particle packing should remain equal to unity as water inside the pore space is simply transferred to the solid phase i e particles swell into the available pore space and the porosity will converge to zero since dem does not allow for the change of shape of spherical particles the numerical model cannot simulate a particle packing whose porosity value converges to zero and consequently dem overestimates the normal displacement at contact points and thus too much particle volume overlaps as a result water suction arises inside the particle packing causing an increase in capillary pressure even though the results of simulation 1 are purely hypothetical we use results of simulation 1 to gain insight and compare to other cases fig 6 shows the capillary pressure saturation curve for simulation 1 which has substantially larger values of capillary pressure compared to other simulations for expanding domains due to the decrease in pore throat and pore unit radii with swelling as seen in fig 7 the swelling rate decreases linearly with the amount of absorption its value is larger than the other simulations because the majority of the pore units remain water saturated while in scenarios 2 to 4 air is invading and thus reducing the wetted surface area of grains 4 2 the effect of swelling rate to study the effect of swelling rate we varied the value of k 0 from 0 10 to 10 s 1 in simulations 2 to 4 figure 6 shows that the capillary pressure values are increasing with k 0 thus with τ f l o w τ a b s note that τ d e f τ a b s remains very small with increasing k 0 for simulations 2 and 3 τ f l o w τ a b s is small enough for the distribution of water and air to be close to equilibrium during swelling of the particles but for simulation 4 the swelling rate becomes too large compared to the speed at which air is able to move into the particle packing causing a significant water suction gradient inside the packing in other words air water interfaces do not move easily into the particle packing when swelling is fast consequently the capillary pressure increases and the air water interfacial area is lower than that for slow swelling simulations 2 and 3 thus simulation 4 results in lower values of air water interfacial area than for simulations 2 and 3 as shown in fig 8 and 9 in addition the fast swelling rate in simulation 4 prevents air from infiltrating at low absorption ratios and therefore the saturation decreases less with absorption ratio than simulations 2 and 3 see fig 8 as a consequence the swelling rate decreases at higher values of absorption ratio for simulation 4 than those of 2 and 3 see fig 7 the swelling rate also affects the evolution of the height of the particle bed see fig 10 if τ f l o w τ a b s is small enough for unsaturated flow to sustain the swelling rate simulations 2 and 3 then the general observation is the higher the swelling rate the less efficient the particle packing deforms consequently the particle packing has a higher porosity value and a taller particle bed for the first part of swelling this observation also applies to simulation 4 as it has a higher swelling rate than simulations 2 and 3 and thus the particle bed is taller than the other samples however air water interfaces are not developed in the particle packing for simulation 4 and thus the expansion of the particle bed ceases 4 3 solid water interfacial area as function of swelling and saturation in the continuum scale model developed by diersch et al 2010 the following equation was employed to approximate the wetted fraction particles surface area as a function of saturation s 22 f w 1 e s α e x p 1 e α e x p where α exp is a fitting parameter the values of fw for different saturation values as calculated in simulations 2 and 3 are plotted in fig 11 and can be fitted using eq 22 with α exp 4 1 while data of simulation 4 can be fitted with α exp 0 85 mirnyy et al 2013 reported also a positive value of α exp namely 0 4 based on backfitting of their model on experiments to enable a comparison between the work by mirnyy et al 2013 and our simulations we employ the value of τ f l o w τ a b s to evaluate α exp from section 3 3 it appears that simulation 4 has a similar value of τ f l o w τ a b s to the experimental data by mirnyy et al 2013 our numerical results show that simulation 4 has a similar fw s curve as that of mirnyy et al 2013 and therefore the value for α exp between mirnyy et al 2013 and our simulations is similar namely 0 40 and 0 85 respectively to conclude the fraction fw not only depends on saturation s but also on the flow rate compared to the swelling rate i e τ f l o w τ a b s because scenario s 2 and 3 yield the same fw s relation but simulation 4 gives a different relation that yields lower values for fw 5 conclusions we have developed a grain scale modelling technique for the simulation of unsaturated flow in deforming and highly swelling granular materials the discrete element method was used for calculations of swelling and the subsequent deformation of particle packings unsaturated flow was solved using a pore scale model using impes implicit pressure and explicit saturation scheme that was tailored for pore units in a deforming packing of spheres deformation was included by changing the volume of pore units pore unit radii pore throat radii during swelling simulations were conducted for swelling of a bed of particles that absorbs one pore volume of water results indicated that by varying the swelling coefficient swelling behaviour is substantially affected if unsaturated flow is sufficiently fast the water pressure remains close to hydrostatic conditions while if unsaturated flow is slow a water suction arises inside the particle packing as a consequent of the swelling furthermore we show that the fraction of wetted solid surface area as a function of saturation is not a unique function and it depends on the ratio of the time scales of flow τ flow and absorption τ abs thus on τ f l o w τ a b s credit authorship contribution statement thomas sweijen

462,in this work a grain scale modelling technique is introduced for the simulation of unsaturated flow in deforming and swelling granular materials to do so a pore scale model for unsaturated flow is coupled to the discrete element method dem it is assumed that initially a dry packing of particles is quickly invaded by a liquid and becomes fully saturated particles start absorbing the liquid and this causes a rearrangement of particles entrance of air into the packing and a redistribution of the liquid i e unsaturated flow flow was computed using a scheme of implicit pressure solver and explicit saturation update impes whilst particle movement was modelled using dem simulations are continued until the packing is dry again this is the first time that such a pore scale model has been developed we have used the model to investigate unsaturated flow during drying of a bed of swelling particles results indicated that the characteristic time scales of unsaturated flow and water absorption determine the swelling behaviour of the particle packing keywords swelling particles grain scale model dem unsaturated flow 1 introduction unsaturated flow in swelling porous materials poses an intricate and highly coupled problem swelling not only causes deformation of the solid phase and rearrangement of grains but also affects the distribution of the liquid inside the pores which subsequently affects the swelling of the solid phase for example a coal bed may swell due to injection and subsequent adsorption of co2 inside the coal matrix which causes an increase in internal stress and a subsequent decrease in permeability espinoz et al 2014 pan et al 2012 and references therein but the decrease in permeability inhibits the usage of coal bed for further carbon sequestration swelling of porous materials also occurs in anthropogenic materials such hydrophilic binders inside the coating layer of paper during ink injection see e g lamminmäki et al 2012 the swelling of potatoes during frying takhar 2014 and the swelling of starch in food e g tester and morrison 1990 yeh and li 1996 in this work the focus is on swelling of a bed of super absorbent polymer sap particles which are used in hygienic products sap particles can absorb distilled water up to 1000 times their initial weight and up to 40 times of a fluid having a physiological salinity e g graham and wilson 1998 and references therein the swelling of an individual sap particle is a complex process it includes fluid transport into the polymer framework of particle ion redistribution inside the polymer framework bertrand et al 2016 yu et al 2017 huyghe and janssen 1997 an expanding particle boundary radu et al 2002 sweijen et al 2017b as well as the cracking of surface of an initially dry sap particle ding et al 2018 the swelling of a bed of sap particles is not only controlled by the swelling of individual particles but also by processes occurring within the pores of the particle bed diersch et al 2010 sweijen et al 2017a swelling of porous materials is a specific case of hydromechanical coupling that in general involves the coupling of deformation of the porous solid and liquid flow inside its pores to characterize hydromechanical coupling macro scale models have been developed that describe both deformation and unsaturated flow however the constitutive relations in such models are still being debated in particular the dependency of effective stress on capillary pressure and interfacial area e g in bishop s equation cf nikooee et al 2013 huyghe et al 2017 in addition macro scale models entail many dependencies that must be identified prior to simulations for example hydraulic parameters such as relative permeability and capillary pressure saturation curves depend on the state of stress of a porous material which has been shown experimentally see e g nuth and laloui 2008 salager et al 2013 oh and lu 2014 tavakoli dastjerdi et al 2014 and numerically see e g rostami et al 2015 sweijen et al 2016 milatz and grabe 2019 studied the relation of unsaturated flow with shearing of a grain skeleton of sand using ct imaging their study gave insight in the dependency of e g interfacial area of air and water on strain for swelling materials there are more constitutive equations required such as the effect of water saturation on the swelling rate and the effect of swelling rate on water pressure inside the porous material see e g diersch et al 2010 experimental characterization of swelling materials is complex which is particularly true for swelling of sap particles the swelling and deformation are large and the period is short typically sap absorbs 40 times its initial weight within 5 to 10 minutes e g kabiri et al 2003 an alternative to experiments would be to conduct pore scale modelling based on pore scale physics and rules there is a huge literature on pore network models for the description of two phase flow and transport in granular porous media see e g el zehairy et al 2019 molnar et al 2019 joekar niasar et al 2010 raoof and hassanizadeh 2010 in pore network models the pore space is explicitly reconstructed and one can account for pore sizes shape topology and connectivity even possible changes of the pore space as a result of dissolution precipitation wolterbeek and raoof 2018 or biofilm growth have been included qin and hassanizadeh 2015 however in pore network models one cannot explicitly take into account the shape of grains their movement and deformation or temporal changes in shape and size a suitable grain scale model for simulating deformation of particle packing s is the discrete element method dem which is capable of computing the movements of individual particles during deformation inside a 3 dimensional packing of particles cundall and strack 1979 dem has previously been coupled to a pore network by kharaghani et al 2011 to study mechanical effects during drying dem can also be coupled with the pore finite volume pfv method to simulate a number of different processes such as i saturated flow inside deforming packings of spheres chareyre et al 2012 catalano et al 2014 ii fluidization of a bed of particles montellà et al 2016 and iii erosion of a particle bed hosn et al 2019 dem has also been coupled to the pore unit assembly pua method which subdivides the pore geometry into pore units and pore throats using the coupling of dem with pua capillary pressure saturation curves have been constructed for a large variety of particle packing s to study soil water retention curves yuan et al 2015 mahmoodlu et al 2016 sweijen et al 2016 thus using dem with either pfv or pua allows for pore scale simulations of the coupling between deformation and fluid flow or capillarity this yields insight into complex 3 dimensional processes of particle rearrangement and fluid flow inside granular materials which otherwise would be difficult to study experimentally see for example the comprehensive experimental work of macminn et al 2015 on 2 dimensional particle rearrangement due to fluid flow recently sweijen et al 2018 coupled dem to a pore scale model for unsaturated flow they developed a pore scale model using impes implicit pressure and explicit saturation scheme which was based on pua and could simulate dynamic drainage inside a rigid packing of spheres thus not allowing for deformation that work combines two phase flow algorithms originating from pore network models see e g thompson 2002 and joekar niasar et al 2010 with the concept of pore unit assembly in the present work the dynamic code of sweijen et al 2018 is extended to include large swelling of grains due to water absorption their subsequent deformation and the change of pore space this is the first grain scale model that is capable of simulating unsaturated flow in an packing of highly swelling grains the aim is to study swelling of a sap particle bed and the subsequent drying or drainage of the pore space to do so we have the following objectives i to develop a pore scale model that can simulate unsaturated flow in deforming porous materials by extending the coupling of dem and pua and include deformation ii to identify processes that occur during drainage and swelling of sap particle beds and to identify their characteristic time scales iii to study a rigid packing of swelling particles iv to study the effect of swelling rate of individual particles on the swelling behaviour a bed of particles these objectives are tested on a virtual particle bed of sap particles inside a beaker glass the packing is initially saturated with water the sap particles will start to swell and absorb water whilst air will move into the particle packing from above when the initial volume of water is absorbed the particle packing will stop swelling 2 numerical methods the simulation framework we use is the open source software yade which is a 3 dimensional numerical model based on the discrete element method dem šmilauer et al 2015 in that framework sweijen et al 2018 previously added the pore unit assembly method to enable unsaturated flow inside particle packings in this approach an assembly of pore units is generated based on the particle locations in dem using that assembly unsaturated flow has been simulated for non deforming assemblies of particles in what follows we extend the pore unit assembly method to enable simulation of unsaturated flow and deformation thus allowing for coupled calculations of unsaturated flow and particle movements following dem for simplification in dem calculations for determining the movement of grains we do not include forces exerted on particles by pore fluids air and or water the physical meaning of this assumption is that capillary and viscous forces which act on particles do not affect the movement of particles in future work adding forces that arise from the occupancy of pore units by water and water can relax this assumption following the work byyuan and chareyre 2017 2 1 determining the pore unit assembly in order to allow for coupling of dem simulations with unsaturated flow a meshing algorithm is employed that extracts a pore unit assembly out of the particle configuration sweijen et al 2018 introduced the meshing algorithm and a short summary is given here see also fig 1 the lowest level of meshing is that of the particle centres which is dependent on the state of stress inside the particle packing and which is determined by dem the particle centres determine the intermediate level of meshing which is that of grain based tetrahedra each grain based tetrahedron has its vertices on the particle centres this method relies on triangulation of the particle packing and was implemented into yade by chareyre et al 2012 and catalano et al 2014 each tetrahedron encloses a pore space that is replaced by regular shape for sake of simplifying the pore geometry when multiple tetrahedra enclose a single pore space the tetrahedra are merged and replaced by a different regular shape see for more detail sweijen et al 2018 the assembly of regular shapes is the highest level of meshing referred to as an assembly of pore units regular shapes are for example tetrahedra cubes octahedra each regular shape is assumed to have its corners wedged into the pore throats of the particle packing since regular shapes have a known geometry a library of geometrical constants are determined that describe the relation between capillary pressure p i c and saturation si within each pore unit the equation for p i c was initially defined by joekar niasar et al 2010 for cubical pore units and extended for various shapes by sweijen et al 2018 1 p i c 2 γ χ v i 3 1 e κ s i where γ is the surface tension of air water χ and κ are geometrical constants and vi is the volume of a pore unit in addition to the capillary pressure inside a pore unit an entry criterium is imposed for air to invade a saturated pore unit j from a neighbouring pore unit i the entry pressure of pore throat ij needs to be overcome the entry criteria are implemented in sweijen et al 2018 and entails p a i r p j w 2 γ r i j with rij being the effective radius of pore throat ij thus the pore unit assembly describes the connectivity of pore units among each other the size of pore units the size of pore throats and the capillary pressure saturation relations within each pore unit this assembly is then used to model unsaturated flow to achieve hydro mechanical coupling changes in particle locations are directly projected to the grain based tetrahedra and subsequently to the pore unit assembly the numerical procedure contains the following three computational steps for every time step see fig 2 i update of particle locations using dem ii update of the local capillary pressure saturation curve and pore throat entry pressures iii computation of unsaturated flow thus first a time step is made by dem to go from time t to time t δt then flow computations are conducted to compute the water pressure and saturation at time t δt in what follows the algorithm to compute unsaturated flow is explained 2 2 change of pore unit volume due to particle movement unsaturated flow is computed by an impes scheme implicit pressure solver and an explicit saturation update as implemented into yade by sweijen et al 2018 consider a pore unit i that has a volume vi the change in pore unit volume d v i d t is the sum of volume change due to swelling of the surrounding particles d v i d t a b s and volume change due to the relative movement of particles d v i d t m o v see fig 3 thus we have following sweijen et al 2017b 2 d v i d t d v i d t m o v d v i d t a b s the value of d v i d t a b s is always negative during swelling and it is determined using the swelling rate of the enclosing particles which is further discussed in section 3 1 here the change of particle volume is assumed to be equal to the volume of absorbed water as the mass density of swollen particles is almost the same as the water density we can assume that the change in pore unit volume due to water absorption by sap particles is equal to the absorbed water volume so this change does not directly cause flow of water since water is simply changed from being in a liquid state to a solid state i e absorbed into the sap particle but a subsequent movement of particles will cause a change in void volume which can cause movement of water therefore the flux d v i d t m o v is considered when solving for pressure while d v i d t a b s is only considered when updating the water saturation the volume change terms in eq 1 are determined at time step t δt based on the change in volume of the pore unit due to particle movement as well as swelling using dem 2 3 computation of unsaturated flow in this section the governing equations of flow in deforming pore units are provided consider pore unit i that has a water pressure pi a water saturation si and it is connected to neighbouring pore unit j via pore throat ij that has a conductivity kij the volume balance for saturated pore units reads 3 j 1 n i k i j p i p j d v i d t m o v chareyre et al 2012 and catalano et al 2014 have previously implemented eq 3 to solve for water pressure in saturated pore units in a deforming non swelling granular material for partially saturated pore units the following discretized volume balance holds 4 j 1 n i k i j p i t δ t p j t δ t d v i s i d t m o v t δ t eq 4 is non linear as kij depends on the presence of air in pore units i and j as well as their capillary pressure for more details see sweijen et al 2018 in addition si depends on pi contributing to the non linearity of eq 4 therefore it requires simplifications before we can solve it for water pressure the right hand side of eq 4 is discretized into 5 d v i s i d t m o v t δ t s i t δ t v i t δ t s i t v i t δ t the value of d v i d t m o v is already known at time step t δt from dem computations as explained above therefore the term v i t t is determined as follows 6 v i t δ t v i t d v i d t m o v t δ t δ t next we introduce the following linearization to solve for saturation inside a pore unit 7 s i t δ t s i t d s i d p i t d p i d t t δ t δ t where d s i d p i is the derivative of the local capillary pressure saturation curve of each pore unit see eq 1 the value of d s i d p i is evaluated at time step t after combining eqs 5 to 7 we have 8 d v i s i w d t m o v t δ t s i t d v i d t m o v t δ t v i t d v i d t m o v t δ t δ t d s i d p i t d p i d t t δ t in eq 8 d p i d t t δ t can be rewritten as p i t δ t p i t δ t combining eqs 4 and 8 and rearranging various terms yields 9 p i t δ t j 1 n i k i j t v i t δ t d v i d t m o v t δ t d s i d p i t j 1 n i k i j t p j t δ t s i t d v i d t m o v t δ t v i t δ t d v i d t m o v t δ t d s i d p i t p i t eqs 4 and 9 constitute a set of linear equations that have the following form 10 a p i t δ t j 0 n i b p j t δ t c where a b and c are coefficients independent of p i t t eq 10 can be solved for water pressure note that the change of pore unit volume due to particle movement d v i d t m o v is obtained from dem simulations eq 10 simplifies into eq 1 for saturated pore units which makes eq 10 applicable to saturated and unsaturated pore units after obtaining p i t t the saturation is explicitly updated while accounting for the water absorption by the swelling particles 11 s i t δ t s i t d s i d p i p i w t δ t p i w t δ t v i t δ t d v i d t a b s 3 model setup 3 1 discrete element method setup the discrete element method was setup following previous work of the authors sweijen et al 2017a where the swelling behaviour of a saturated sap particle bed was modelled and tested against experiments in that work the contact mechanics between the swelling particles is described by hertz mindlin contact mechanics see modenese et al 2012 for more details for its implementation contact mechanics in dem are based on normal displacement between particles that results in a force where the normal displacement is conceptualized as an overlap between two spherical particles all particles were assumed to have a constant young s modulus of 10 kpa the particle particle friction angle was set to 5 5 lorenz et al 1997 and the density was set to 1000 kg m 3 mirnyy et al 2012 all particles had an initial diameter of 460µm prior to swelling simulations a packing of dry sap particles was generated first 3000 particles were placed into a relatively large cubic modelling domain 10³ mm³ in such a relatively large domain the particles do not form a tight packing and porosity is very large then the particles were compacted by applying an artificial 10 pa confining stress to all boundaries of the modelling domain reducing the domain size significantly this resulted in a porosity value of 0 38 and a domain size of 5 4³ mm³ the permeability of the dry sap particle packing was determined using a virtual permeability test in yade dem the permeability was found to be 4 8 10 10 m2 once a packing of dry sap particles was generated the boundary conditions were set to the conditions described in the following section after the particle packing was generated the swelling simulations could commence the swelling of particles was simulated by simply increasing all particle sizes over time using a growth factor following sweijen et al 2017a a simple kinetic law was used to describe the change of radius as a function of time although more complex and comprehensive models exist for swelling of spherical particle huyghe and jansen 1997 radu et al 2002 sweijen et al 2017b here we employed the kinetic law proposed by omidian et al 1998 with an additional factor to account for partial wetting of the particle surface under unsaturated conditions following diersch et al 2010 12 d r x d t f w k 0 r x m a x r x where k 0 is a kinetic coefficient fw is the fraction of the wetted surface of a particle rx is the radius rmax is the maximum radius the fraction fw is the ratio of the surface area of particle x that is in contact with water and the total surface area of particle x the maximum radius was set to 3 6r 0 where r 0 was the initial radius this corresponded to an absorption ratio of 30 g g furthermore the swelling rate is expressed as a dimensionless group 1 k 0 r 0 d r d t where r is the arithmetic mean of radii of all particle eq 12 plays an important role in the coupling of dem with the model for unsaturated flow if a particle is surrounded by empty pores its swelling rate converges to zero if a particle is only surrounded by fully saturated pore units its swelling rate is at a maximum value but still dependent on its radius and initial radius the wetted surface area of a particle is based on the saturation of the surrounding pore units if a pore unit is empty saturation lower than 10 6 the solid surface area in that pore unit is dry otherwise it is considered wet 3 2 initial and boundary conditions in this study we simulate a one direction swelling experiment in a box similar to swelling of particles in a beaker glass the side walls and the bottom of the box are fixed and the top boundary is free to move see figure 4 all boundaries are no flow boundary conditions to water and only via the top boundary air can enter into the particle packing we assume that at the start of the experiment the bed of sap particles becomes saturated quickly without any significant swelling as a result the particle bed is fully saturated except for the pore units along the top boundary which are partially saturated with air at an initial capillary pressure of 2500 pa the initial volume of water inside the pores in between the particles is the only available water for swelling throughout the simulation note that sap particles are considered non porous themselves and thus initially do not contain any water after the initial conditions the particles start to absorb water and swell and the particle packing will increase in height eventually the particle bed dries out and swelling will cease 3 3 different regimes in the coupling of unsaturated flow swelling and particle movement three different processes govern unsaturated flow inside the pore space of a swelling particle bed with each process having its own characteristic time step namely unsaturated flow τ flow water absorption τ abs and deformation τ def the magnitude of the characteristic times will give insight into the behaviour of the particle packing therefore we introduce the characteristic times and their effect on the overall swelling behaviour of a bed of particles the characteristic time of water absorption τ abs is based on eq 12 such that 13 τ a b s r i m a x r i d r i d t 1 f w k 0 now if we define fw to be the fraction of wetted surface of all particles in the packing then the second part of eq 13 is used to determine characteristic time for swelling of the whole particle packing the characteristic time for unsaturated flow τ flow is given as 14 τ f l o w l v l μ ρ w g k μ d x k d p where μ is the viscosity of water l is the length of the modelling domain ρ w is the density of water g is the gravitational constant q is the darcy flux k is the intrinsic permeability of the modelling domain and d p d x is the pressure gradient in water finally we introduce the time scale for deformation which is based on the relaxation time required for a contact to dissipate its potential energy 15 τ d e f r 2 ρ e in which e is the young s modulus of the particles ρ is the particle density assumed to be 1 g cm 3 and r is the average particle diameter to illustrate the effect of three characteristic times on the overall swelling behaviour we define the following ratios of time scales 16 τ f l o w τ a b s l μ f w k 0 ρ w g k 1 15 s f w k 0 17 τ d e f τ a b s d 50 f w k 0 2 ρ e 7 3 10 5 s f w k 0 18 τ f l o w τ d e f 2 l μ ρ w g k d 50 ρ e 1 6 10 4 using eqs 16 18 we can identify the following cases which are also illustrated in fig 5 i τ flow τ abs water residing inside the pores can find equilibrium very fast and thus dynamic effects of unsaturated flow will be short lived therefore unsaturated flow can be simulated using a quasi static capillarity model rather than a dynamic code ii τ flow τ abs water exchange among pores is slow and thus the swelling rate may be strongly affected by the lack of water inside the particle packing which might cause suction inside the particle packing even when it is saturated iii τ def τ abs the particle particle contact points can dissipate their potential energy quickly in practise τ def is always smaller than τ abs and thus particle movement can keep up with the deformation iv τ def τ abs swelling is much faster than that particle contacts can dissipate their potential energy therefore particle movement will be limited and the particle packing will clog i e the porosity will tend to zero this scenario will be similar to swelling of a bed of particles inside a rigid box where particle movement will also be restricted v τ flow τ def water residing inside the pores can find equilibrium very fast and thus dynamic effects will be short lived vi τ flow τ def particle contacts can dissipate their energy quickly and thus the flow of water will be dominating the kinetics of particle movement for swelling sap particles we have τ f l o w τ d e f 1 and τ d e f τ a b s 1 indicating that the relaxation of particle contacts occurs fast compared to flow and water absorption processes nevertheless we consider one scenario simulation 1 where particles are not allowed to move i e τ def in addition we conduct three simulations for varying values of k 0 starting from 0 1 to 10 s 1 simulation 2 to 4 which varies τ f l o w τ a b s from 0 115 to 11 5 thus the value of τ f l o w τ a b s at the initial state of swelling is around unity which implicates that swelling and unsaturated flow have similar time scales lastly we consider a hypothetical packing where no swelling occurs i e τ abs simulation 5 and thus nothing happens because particle locations do not change and all pores remain saturated the characteristic times steps are summarize in table 1 in practise the value of τ f l o w τ a b s is in the order of 10 based on the experimental work by mirnyy et al 2013 where we have k 0 5 10 3 s 1 l 0 20 m mirnyy et al 2013 k 10 11 m 2 diersch et al 2011 this implies that the experimental work by mirnyy et al 2013 is best represented by simulation 4 which has τ f l o w τ a b s equal to 11 5 3 4 mechanical considerations as mentioned earlier we made some assumptions regarding the mechanics of particles and the packing first forces on the particles exerted by the surrounding fluids i e air and or water were not included as the water pressure in the packing would be smaller than the air pressure the particle packing would in experiments be more compressed by the suction of water secondly the particles are assumed to keep their initial spherical shape during swelling thus particles cannot grow into available pore space which implies that case iv of section 3 3 cannot be modelled using our code in real sap particle packings we may have plastic deformation of particles and a change of their shape whilst our code assumes that normal displacement at particle contacts is purely a reversible deformation 3 5 mass balance of the simulations the coupling of unsaturated flow with dem requires two mass balances in order to verify the quality of the numerical simulations firstly modelling of unsaturated flow requires a mass balance on its own for solving eqs 10 and 11 the mass balance is verified at each time step and the accumulative error is registered over time from these analysis it follows that locally at each time step mass is conserved with the inclusion of very small truncation loss of saturation at saturations of lower than 10 6 the accumulative error is largest for simulation 1 with 0 2 which was a result of the rigid packing in which porosity tends to zero secondly there is a mass balance of the coupling between unsaturated flow and dem which is mostly affected by the normal displacement at particle contacts the larger the normal displacement the larger the error in mass balance becomes thus with larger values of τ f l o w τ a b s the error increases from an accumulative error in water balance from 1 simulation 2 to 8 simulation 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 the swelling of a rigid packing in simulation 1 the particle locations are fixed in order to study the swelling of a rigid packing this scenario is purely hypothetical but would be similar to swelling particles inside a rigid box in theory the saturation inside the particle packing should remain equal to unity as water inside the pore space is simply transferred to the solid phase i e particles swell into the available pore space and the porosity will converge to zero since dem does not allow for the change of shape of spherical particles the numerical model cannot simulate a particle packing whose porosity value converges to zero and consequently dem overestimates the normal displacement at contact points and thus too much particle volume overlaps as a result water suction arises inside the particle packing causing an increase in capillary pressure even though the results of simulation 1 are purely hypothetical we use results of simulation 1 to gain insight and compare to other cases fig 6 shows the capillary pressure saturation curve for simulation 1 which has substantially larger values of capillary pressure compared to other simulations for expanding domains due to the decrease in pore throat and pore unit radii with swelling as seen in fig 7 the swelling rate decreases linearly with the amount of absorption its value is larger than the other simulations because the majority of the pore units remain water saturated while in scenarios 2 to 4 air is invading and thus reducing the wetted surface area of grains 4 2 the effect of swelling rate to study the effect of swelling rate we varied the value of k 0 from 0 10 to 10 s 1 in simulations 2 to 4 figure 6 shows that the capillary pressure values are increasing with k 0 thus with τ f l o w τ a b s note that τ d e f τ a b s remains very small with increasing k 0 for simulations 2 and 3 τ f l o w τ a b s is small enough for the distribution of water and air to be close to equilibrium during swelling of the particles but for simulation 4 the swelling rate becomes too large compared to the speed at which air is able to move into the particle packing causing a significant water suction gradient inside the packing in other words air water interfaces do not move easily into the particle packing when swelling is fast consequently the capillary pressure increases and the air water interfacial area is lower than that for slow swelling simulations 2 and 3 thus simulation 4 results in lower values of air water interfacial area than for simulations 2 and 3 as shown in fig 8 and 9 in addition the fast swelling rate in simulation 4 prevents air from infiltrating at low absorption ratios and therefore the saturation decreases less with absorption ratio than simulations 2 and 3 see fig 8 as a consequence the swelling rate decreases at higher values of absorption ratio for simulation 4 than those of 2 and 3 see fig 7 the swelling rate also affects the evolution of the height of the particle bed see fig 10 if τ f l o w τ a b s is small enough for unsaturated flow to sustain the swelling rate simulations 2 and 3 then the general observation is the higher the swelling rate the less efficient the particle packing deforms consequently the particle packing has a higher porosity value and a taller particle bed for the first part of swelling this observation also applies to simulation 4 as it has a higher swelling rate than simulations 2 and 3 and thus the particle bed is taller than the other samples however air water interfaces are not developed in the particle packing for simulation 4 and thus the expansion of the particle bed ceases 4 3 solid water interfacial area as function of swelling and saturation in the continuum scale model developed by diersch et al 2010 the following equation was employed to approximate the wetted fraction particles surface area as a function of saturation s 22 f w 1 e s α e x p 1 e α e x p where α exp is a fitting parameter the values of fw for different saturation values as calculated in simulations 2 and 3 are plotted in fig 11 and can be fitted using eq 22 with α exp 4 1 while data of simulation 4 can be fitted with α exp 0 85 mirnyy et al 2013 reported also a positive value of α exp namely 0 4 based on backfitting of their model on experiments to enable a comparison between the work by mirnyy et al 2013 and our simulations we employ the value of τ f l o w τ a b s to evaluate α exp from section 3 3 it appears that simulation 4 has a similar value of τ f l o w τ a b s to the experimental data by mirnyy et al 2013 our numerical results show that simulation 4 has a similar fw s curve as that of mirnyy et al 2013 and therefore the value for α exp between mirnyy et al 2013 and our simulations is similar namely 0 40 and 0 85 respectively to conclude the fraction fw not only depends on saturation s but also on the flow rate compared to the swelling rate i e τ f l o w τ a b s because scenario s 2 and 3 yield the same fw s relation but simulation 4 gives a different relation that yields lower values for fw 5 conclusions we have developed a grain scale modelling technique for the simulation of unsaturated flow in deforming and highly swelling granular materials the discrete element method was used for calculations of swelling and the subsequent deformation of particle packings unsaturated flow was solved using a pore scale model using impes implicit pressure and explicit saturation scheme that was tailored for pore units in a deforming packing of spheres deformation was included by changing the volume of pore units pore unit radii pore throat radii during swelling simulations were conducted for swelling of a bed of particles that absorbs one pore volume of water results indicated that by varying the swelling coefficient swelling behaviour is substantially affected if unsaturated flow is sufficiently fast the water pressure remains close to hydrostatic conditions while if unsaturated flow is slow a water suction arises inside the particle packing as a consequent of the swelling furthermore we show that the fraction of wetted solid surface area as a function of saturation is not a unique function and it depends on the ratio of the time scales of flow τ flow and absorption τ abs thus on τ f l o w τ a b s credit authorship contribution statement thomas sweijen

463,the recent combination of positron emission tomography pet and magnetic resonance mr imaging modalities in one clinical diagnostic tool represents a scientific advancement with high potential impact in geoscientific research by enabling simultaneous and explicit quantification of up to three distinct fluids in the same porous system decoupled information from pet mr imaging was used here for the first time to quantify spatial and temporal porous media fluid flow three dimensional fluid distribution was quantified simultaneously and independently by each imaging modality and fluid phases were correlated with high reproducibility between modalities and repetitive fluid injections graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords multimodal imaging positron emission tomography magnetic resonance in situ imaging miscible flow 1 introduction diagnostic imaging is routinely used to map the interior of the human body and recent advancements enable combined pet and mr imaging in a single hybrid scanner to achieve new complimentary insight much of the human body is soft porous membranes controlling vital liquid flow where functional pet data corroborate anatomical mr data during simultaneous imaging although it may seem like a long leap the gap between physiology and flow physics is short when it comes to imaging and the same non invasive methods are routinely used to characterize fluids and flow in porous sediments access to spatial and temporal flow in porous media by imaging is instrumental to determine the controlling parameters of carbon geo sequestration groundwater flow aquifer remediation and hydrocarbon production imaging techniques are typically divided into attenuation methods and explicit methods where the former measures the gradual loss in photon flux intensity through the imaged sample and produces a time averaged electron density distribution image heindel 2011 attenuation methods such as computed tomography ct imaging therefore rely on sufficient density differences of imaged phases rock fluid bone tissue for high quality images in contrast explicit methods e g mr and pet imaging detect fluids in porous structures directly kulenkampff et al 2008 ersland et al 2010a mitchell et al 2013 mr imaging is rich in physics and a highly versatile tool that measures hydrogen in water or fat in our body or as water oil or gas in sediments mri is well suited for e g gas hydrate production studies ersland et al 2010b and wettability characterization howard 1998 there are however some limitation to applicable rock types because certain minerals may decrease the mr image quality werth et al 2010 pet is primarily used in medical imaging with occasionally reported geoscience use to visualize fluids in construction materials hoff et al 1996 crystalline rocks degueldre et al 1996 and sediments maguire et al 1997 khalili et al 1998 haugan 2000 flow field imaging with pet in porous sandstones dates back to early 2000s ogilvie et al 2001 and more recently in other geomaterials dechsiri et al 2005 kulenkampff et al 2008 boutchko et al 2012 pini et al 2016 pet measures gamma radiation produced when a positron from a positron emitting radionuclide annihilates with an electron emitting a 511 kev gamma photon pair in opposite directions a range of available positron emitting tracers facilitate explicit tracking of different aqueous or gaseous phases including co2 brattekås and haugen 2020 fernø et al 2015a quantitative assessment of core scale fluid saturations with combined pet ct was first reported by fernø et al 2015a they found that saturation quantification was improved by pet compared to ct attributed to the limited electron density contrast between fluid phases and an excellent pet signal to noise

brattekås et al 2017 and foam flow in fracture networks brattekås et al 2019 a comprehensive description of pet systems and methods for earth science applications is detailed elsewhere zahasky et al 2019 multimodal pet mr quantify dynamic fluid saturations without the need for significant fluid density contrasts and is therefore highly relevant in several porous media applications although pet ct scanners are more readily available porous media dispersion and adsorption is one example crucial for ground water flow and miscible displacements in petroleum production and of interest to engineers concerned with adsorbing agents like tracers salts or surfactants pet mr imaging can potentially improve studies of carbon geo sequestration by explicitly imaging the displacement of formation brine by co2 rich brine enhancing the quantification of foam propagation by determining the decoupled propagation of each foam component or spatially determine wettability alterations of pores and seals during co2 injection combined pet mr imaging enables simultaneous quantification of up to three fluid phases in opaque systems within the same field of view and time frame unlocking a scientific advancement with potentially large impact in the geoscience community the overall objective of this study was to evaluate multimodal pet mr methodology for geoscientific research and to demonstrate its capability of explicit high resolution imaging of displacement processes in sediments this objective was achieved by directly comparing two and three dimensional pet and mr fluid signal maps during controlled miscible displacements i e studying traced water flow where mr and pet signals were acquired from the injected aqueous phases using combinations of non reactive radiotracer fluorodeoxyglucose f18 fdg deuterium water and water the mr modality measures the density of h atoms within the field of view and the number of h atoms in the pore space was controlled by injecting either d2o brine with no h atoms or h2o brine with abundant h atoms the pet modality measures gamma radiation produced when a positron from a positron emitting radionuclide annihilates with an electron emitting a 511 kev gamma photon pair in opposite directions to produce a signal detectable by pet brine was labelled with radiotracer f18 fdg the validation of synergistic multimodal multiphase quantification unlocks the potential usage for a wider range of geoscientific research areas 2 materials and methods we studied three miscible flow cycles where pet and mr source signals were independently varied table 1 spatial and temporal visualization of miscible fluid flow enable determination of local flow variations on the core and sub core scales a cylindrical bentheimer sandstone sample nominal length 100 mm diameter 38 mm coated in epoxy resin was fitted with polyoxymethylene end pieces and used for all injection tests nylon 1 8 in swagelok fittings and tubings were used to avoid magnetic disturbance in the proximity of the pet mr instrument the sandstone pore volume 28 cm3 was fully saturated with brine 3 5 wt nacl in distilled h2o prior to the three miscible injection cycles the core system was centrally mounted in a head coil of a siemens ag biograph mmr erlangen germany whole body simultaneous pet mr scanner this pet mr scanner operates each modality pet and mr independently but in parallel enabling simultaneous imaging within the same field of view without moving the core system between modalities for each injection cycle two pore volumes pv of brine were injected with a constant volumetric flow rate one cm3 minute injected brine was labelled to produce a signal detectable by pet and or mr using combinations of non reactive radiotracer f18 fdg deuterium water and water detailed in table 1 in flow cycle pet mr 367mbq of radiotracer was mixed in 200ml of d2o brine and in flow cycle pet mrconst 287mbq were mixed in 170ml h2o brine each flow cycle with simultaneous imaging lasted for one hour 2 1 imaging protocols pet and mr imaging protocols must be separately optimized to facilitate parameter determination for different time frames and according to their respective strengths we set imaging parameters to accommodate a high flow rate reducing spatial voxel resolution to reduce acquisition time the mr image acquisition protocol was rarest rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement with short echo time with echo time 8 8 ms and rare factor 4 was used these settings produced 28 two dimensional coronal slices of 2 mm thickness within two minutes the scanning time of two minutes covered the whole core volume and balanced adequate signal to noise ratio and temporal resolution required to capture dynamic behavior during injection cycles spatial and temporal mr resolutions are limited by the magnetic field and gradient strength werth et al 2010 the pet modality continuously records positron emission and resolutions are determined during image post processing the temporal resolution was here set to two minutes to align with mr data but could be significantly reduced to capture rapid flow processes the spatial resolution of pet was 0 7x0 7x2mm while mr resolution was set to 0 5x0 5x2mm in the x y z directions in this experiment section 3 2 the radiotracer f18 fdg is a glucose analog commonly used in diagnostic imaging and was produced using an in house cyclotron radionuclide half life 109 7 minutes was accounted for using embedded algorithms in the pet mr software provided by the manufacturer unlike clinical pet ct systems pet mr lack a direct way to obtain attenuation correction maps keereman et al 2013 and the pet images were reconstructed without attenuation correction mr acquisition parameters can be optimized to yield explicit information about the rock structure e g quantifying local pore size distributions by t2 mapping techniques while pet acquisition parameters cannot pet and mr signals at static conditions were however used to provide descriptive information of spatial fluid distribution on the centimeter scale the number of disintegrations measured by pet and h atom concentration measured by mr correspond to fluid volume by a linear correlation in multiphase systems local fluid saturations may be calculated based on this linearity see e g fernø et al 2015a at fully saturated conditions this same relationship may be used to derive the local porosity values according to ϕ x y z s i g n a l v o x e l x y z s i g n a l v o x e l w h o l e c o r e ϕ w h o l e c o r e where ϕx y x is the porosity at location x y z and ϕwhole core is the porosity of the whole core calculated from weight measurements porosity was calculated in discretized flow elements described in section 3 2 i e the measured number of integrations per volume signal voxel was averaged over several voxels to account for natural fluctuations in the pet instrument 3 fluid displacement miscible fluid displacement processes combined with spatial and temporal information on fluid occupancy enable quantitative analysis of rock heterogeneities that determine local variations in the overall flow pattern herein we demonstrate the potential of using decoupled explicit fluid distribution information from pet mr imaging to determine such variations at core fig 1 and sub core figs 2 and 3 scales 3 1 core scale an excellent agreement between fluid concentration calculated with decoupled pet and mr data was obtained between flow cycles where labelled brine occupancy in the pore volume is equivalent to the normalized concentration of 18f fdg or h respectively reproducibility was evaluated with three injection cycles table 1 consistent core scale concentrations for each cycle were calculated using decoupled mr and pet modalities and results confirm that both imaging modalities were able to accurately quantify temporal concentrations with high accuracy cycle pet mr deviated slightly from the two subsequent cycles due to slightly higher viscosity contrast d2o brine approximately 20 more viscous and 10 denser than h2o brine the small deviation was captured by both modalities pet identified a slightly faster displacement after 1 pv injected compared to the two other flow cycles mr detected a decline between t 0 7 1 2 pv and the deviation was more pronounced compared to pet this discrepancy arises as a result of the higher pet sensitivity and signal to noise ratio snr compared to mr with the current settings snr was directly derived for each imaging modality for pet the number of disintegrations measured per voxel within the core volume was divided by measured disintegrations per volume immediately outside of the core when the pore volume was fully saturated by f18 fdg at the end of cycle pet mr yielding snr 28 1 similarly for mr the average signal per voxel within the core plug at maximum h concentration end of cycle pet mr and constant throughout the rest of the experiment was divided by the core adjacent noise level providing snr 8 1 hence pet was able to detect lower signals compared with mr during cyclic flows the difference between normalized concentrations measured by each modality was identified to be no more than 0 06 saturation points on the core scale ideal displacement was observed for the first 0 6 pv injected when the concentrations for each flow cycle deviated from unity between injected and produced volumes fig 1 and appears to accelerate above ideal the difference is however within the experimental uncertainty resulting from the high injection rate and two minute acquisition time 0 07 pore volumes were injected during acquisition of each image thus the fluid displacement front advanced and could not be accurately determined beyond 0 07 concentration points the uncertainty was much lower at saturation end points when the concentrations of f18 fdg and or h were constant the brine saturating the pore volume was fully displaced after t 1 1 1 8 pv injected corroborating previous miscible water displacements obtained by pet ct imaging fernø et al 2015a a clear difference between pet and mr derived displacements was observed where the h concentration measured by mr appeared static from t 1 6 pv while pet determined that maximum solute concentration was not reached until t 1 77 pv this difference is directly attributed to the excellent sensitivity and snr of pet imaging enabling small changes in concentration near the end points to be distinguished the concentration development after t 1 1 pv needed sub core analysis to to describe the slower than expected increase 3 2 sub core scale dynamic fluid distribution images were digitally sub divided to determine local displacement variations the core was first sliced transversally and each slice was divided into smaller flow elements parallel to the general flow direction fig 2 similar to the discretization approach used by pini et al 2016 and zahasky and benson 2018 this enabled quantification of spatial structural variation which in turn dictates local flow capacity krevor et al 2011 three transversal slices in the core middle captured the overall flow behavior and were used in the sub core analysis as representative elementary volume each of the three slices hold six flow elements spanning the entire core length and structural differences in the core could be spatially quantified to determine the cause for displacement heterogeneities sub core scale porosity could be calculated for each flow element using information from both pet and mr fig 2 and demonstrated that a region with lower porosity not known a priori existed within the pore space this region was visually observed in the initial mr scan when the core was filled with h2o brine the porosity within the pore space was determined to range between 18 and 26 by mr variation of 8 and between 23 and 28 by pet 5 variation the smaller variation measured by pet reveals that attenuation of photons in areas of higher density i e lower porosity was not significant for the small core system at the radiation level used in out experiment hence attenuation correction was not necessary the cause for non uniform miscible displacement was identified to be the low porous heterogeneity fig 3 low end porosity values were predominant in flow elements 5 and 6 while flow elements 1 4 figs 2 and 3 did not exhibit significant porosity heterogeneity signal intensities therefore increased or decreased swiftly in flow elements 1 4 while a slower saturation development was observed in the flow elements incorporating the heterogeneity fig 3 flow deviation in low porosity flow elements was well captured by both pet and mr with good agreement between the modalities in flow elements 1 through 5 fig 3 sub core flow element 6 was determined by both pet and mr to have lower porosity figs 2 and 3 and exhibited the slowest saturation development the slow core scale displacement near end points was largely caused by flow element 6 including the differences in displacement end point measured at 1 6 pv by mr compared to 1 77 pv by pet the excellent sensitivity and snr achieved by pet imaging contributes to a lower uncertainty interval compared to mr fig 3 and the slow continued development in fluid concentration within flow element 6 was visible for longer mr imaging could not distinguish dynamic concentration changes after 1 6 pv injected because the relative signal change within the flow element was low compared to the high adjacent noise level thus discrepancies between results acquired by pet and mr imaging in this study were amplified by the differences in snr the findings from this integrated imaging study presented in sections 3 1 and 3 2 demonstrated that small scale heterogeneities in a presumably homogenous bentheim sandstone sample affected the overall sweep efficiency and preferred flow path of the injected brine local displacement was derived from independent pet and mr signals with an excellent correspondence on the core and sub core scale a low porous region identified by both pet and mr caused deviations from ideal displacement behavior 4 conclusion synergy of a new multimodal imaging method was demonstrated in core scale water resources research for the first time multimodal pet mr imaging represents an opportunity to image and quantify up to three fluid phases in opaque systems within the same field of view and time frame local saturation values were derived from independent pet and mr signals with an excellent correspondence on the core and sub core scale the unambiguous correlation of phase identification across modality and injection schemes enables us to conclude that pet mr

463,the recent combination of positron emission tomography pet and magnetic resonance mr imaging modalities in one clinical diagnostic tool represents a scientific advancement with high potential impact in geoscientific research by enabling simultaneous and explicit quantification of up to three distinct fluids in the same porous system decoupled information from pet mr imaging was used here for the first time to quantify spatial and temporal porous media fluid flow three dimensional fluid distribution was quantified simultaneously and independently by each imaging modality and fluid phases were correlated with high reproducibility between modalities and repetitive fluid injections graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords multimodal imaging positron emission tomography magnetic resonance in situ imaging miscible flow 1 introduction diagnostic imaging is routinely used to map the interior of the human body and recent advancements enable combined pet and mr imaging in a single hybrid scanner to achieve new complimentary insight much of the human body is soft porous membranes controlling vital liquid flow where functional pet data corroborate anatomical mr data during simultaneous imaging although it may seem like a long leap the gap between physiology and flow physics is short when it comes to imaging and the same non invasive methods are routinely used to characterize fluids and flow in porous sediments access to spatial and temporal flow in porous media by imaging is instrumental to determine the controlling parameters of carbon geo sequestration groundwater flow aquifer remediation and hydrocarbon production imaging techniques are typically divided into attenuation methods and explicit methods where the former measures the gradual loss in photon flux intensity through the imaged sample and produces a time averaged electron density distribution image heindel 2011 attenuation methods such as computed tomography ct imaging therefore rely on sufficient density differences of imaged phases rock fluid bone tissue for high quality images in contrast explicit methods e g mr and pet imaging detect fluids in porous structures directly kulenkampff et al 2008 ersland et al 2010a mitchell et al 2013 mr imaging is rich in physics and a highly versatile tool that measures hydrogen in water or fat in our body or as water oil or gas in sediments mri is well suited for e g gas hydrate production studies ersland et al 2010b and wettability characterization howard 1998 there are however some limitation to applicable rock types because certain minerals may decrease the mr image quality werth et al 2010 pet is primarily used in medical imaging with occasionally reported geoscience use to visualize fluids in construction materials hoff et al 1996 crystalline rocks degueldre et al 1996 and sediments maguire et al 1997 khalili et al 1998 haugan 2000 flow field imaging with pet in porous sandstones dates back to early 2000s ogilvie et al 2001 and more recently in other geomaterials dechsiri et al 2005 kulenkampff et al 2008 boutchko et al 2012 pini et al 2016 pet measures gamma radiation produced when a positron from a positron emitting radionuclide annihilates with an electron emitting a 511 kev gamma photon pair in opposite directions a range of available positron emitting tracers facilitate explicit tracking of different aqueous or gaseous phases including co2 brattekås and haugen 2020 fernø et al 2015a quantitative assessment of core scale fluid saturations with combined pet ct was first reported by fernø et al 2015a they found that saturation quantification was improved by pet compared to ct attributed to the limited electron density contrast between fluid phases and an excellent pet signal to noise ratio pet was also found to be superior for imaging co2 entry in low porous materials highly relevant for seal integrity during carbon geo sequestration fernø et al 2015b other examples of pet imaging in porous media include sub core transport property characterization by parameter inversion vasco et al 2018 zahasky and benson 2018 capillary dominated flow føyen et al 2019 wormhole dynamics brattekås et al 2017 and foam flow in fracture networks brattekås et al 2019 a comprehensive description of pet systems and methods for earth science applications is detailed elsewhere zahasky et al 2019 multimodal pet mr quantify dynamic fluid saturations without the need for significant fluid density contrasts and is therefore highly relevant in several porous media applications although pet ct scanners are more readily available porous media dispersion and adsorption is one example crucial for ground water flow and miscible displacements in petroleum production and of interest to engineers concerned with adsorbing agents like tracers salts or surfactants pet mr imaging can potentially improve studies of carbon geo sequestration by explicitly imaging the displacement of formation brine by co2 rich brine enhancing the quantification of foam propagation by determining the decoupled propagation of each foam component or spatially determine wettability alterations of pores and seals during co2 injection combined pet mr imaging enables simultaneous quantification of up to three fluid phases in opaque systems within the same field of view and time frame unlocking a scientific advancement with potentially large impact in the geoscience community the overall objective of this study was to evaluate multimodal pet mr methodology for geoscientific research and to demonstrate its capability of explicit high resolution imaging of displacement processes in sediments this objective was achieved by directly comparing two and three dimensional pet and mr fluid signal maps during controlled miscible displacements i e studying traced water flow where mr and pet signals were acquired from the injected aqueous phases using combinations of non reactive radiotracer fluorodeoxyglucose f18 fdg deuterium water and water the mr modality measures the density of h atoms within the field of view and the number of h atoms in the pore space was controlled by injecting either d2o brine with no h atoms or h2o brine with abundant h atoms the pet modality measures gamma radiation produced when a positron from a positron emitting radionuclide annihilates with an electron emitting a 511 kev gamma photon pair in opposite directions to produce a signal detectable by pet brine was labelled with radiotracer f18 fdg the validation of synergistic multimodal multiphase quantification unlocks the potential usage for a wider range of geoscientific research areas 2 materials and methods we studied three miscible flow cycles where pet and mr source signals were independently varied table 1 spatial and temporal visualization of miscible fluid flow enable determination of local flow variations on the core and sub core scales a cylindrical bentheimer sandstone sample nominal length 100 mm diameter 38 mm coated in epoxy resin was fitted with polyoxymethylene end pieces and used for all injection tests nylon 1 8 in swagelok fittings and tubings were used to avoid magnetic disturbance in the proximity of the pet mr instrument the sandstone pore volume 28 cm3 was fully saturated with brine 3 5 wt nacl in distilled h2o prior to the three miscible injection cycles the core system was centrally mounted in a head coil of a siemens ag biograph mmr erlangen germany whole body simultaneous pet mr scanner this pet mr scanner operates each modality pet and mr independently but in parallel enabling simultaneous imaging within the same field of view without moving the core system between modalities for each injection cycle two pore volumes pv of brine were injected with a constant volumetric flow rate one cm3 minute injected brine was labelled to produce a signal detectable by pet and or mr using combinations of non reactive radiotracer f18 fdg deuterium water and water detailed in table 1 in flow cycle pet mr 367mbq of radiotracer was mixed in 200ml of d2o brine and in flow cycle pet mrconst 287mbq were mixed in 170ml h2o brine each

464,regions with vulnerabilities in their food energy water nexus may also have economic vulnerabilities actions to reduce environmental vulnerabilities may conflict with community concerns about jobs and economic vitality to account for these potentially competing concerns this study builds a nexus simulation model that incorporates water energy food and detailed economic data the model can be used for standalone analysis or incorporated into a multi disciplinary design optimization framework the model is called west for water economy simulation tool and can show how jobs and economic growth interact with surface and groundwater use food and energy a case study for the u s state of oregon illustrates the insights to be gained from the approach and provides a template for readers to develop their own west simulation model keywords coupled human and natural systems chans economics food energy water few water resources tradeoffs 1 introduction the food energy water nexus henceforth nexus concerns the synergies and trade offs between food energy and water security that are not captured if these sectors are analyzed in isolation a number of models have been built which capture certain aspects of the nexus and enable evaluation of interrelated challenges e g daher and mohtar 2015 covarrubias 2019 martinez hernandez et al 2017 cai et al 2018 wicaksono et al 2019 traditional economic models typically fail to account in a meaningful way for how economic agents rely on and are constrained by the availability of natural resources such as water non economic models of the nexus often abstract from economic agents that influence and are influenced by the system to bridge this divide this study develops a simulation model called west for water economy simulation tool below it will be shown that with a parsimonious amount of data for a region or nation the west model can be parameterized and used to simulate possible future nexus scenarios this effort is one response to recent critical reviews which suggest that nexus models increasingly need to incorporate aspects beyond water energy and food such as explicit economic and policy considerations biggs et al 2015 dang et al 2016 konar et al 2016 al saidi and elagib 2017 weitz et al 2017 suggest that the standard nexus concept may be disconnected from the decision making and policy making processes it ultimately seeks to influence there is a need for a model that captures stakeholder decision making variables such as output choices for different industries and the associated processes to food energy water nexus models policy making processes in many regions often include economic considerations that directly impact individuals decisionmakers may be politicians whose constituents are voters that are concerned about economic outcomes communities and regions are in some sense organized around jobs without employment people may move to another community where they can find work reimer 2012 reimer 2014 dao et al 2014 the west model s focus on jobs is just one factor that west incorporates that other models do not the model also accounts for a production flexibility in which different combinations of inputs can be used to produce a good or service business decisions regarding what and how much to produce are based on prices received and the cost of production the businesses that comprise a sector are often engaged in competition with other businesses market economies are common throughout the world and give rise to their own forms of instability chaloff et al 2012 this study develops a simulation model of the nexus for a market economy that incorporates a number of human and economic dimensions missing in other models the west model demonstrates how the food energy and water nexus fits within the broader economy the model can be used to represent regions of various sizes throughout the world it mainly needs a single table of economic and water resource data described below the west model employs numerical optimization methods and is appropriate for market economies in which decisions about water energy and food are largely de centralized the model is static starting with an observed nexus outcome and then predicts what happens when an environmental or economic perturbation or shock occurs the model makes predictions about what happens under future scenarios such as declines in groundwater availability and increased demand for food the model can help researchers capture the conflicting interests faced by community decision makers such as tradeoffs between economic growth and resource conservation the west model can represent systems where there is more than one way to produce a good for example a crop could be produced using capital intensive irrigation equipment that minimizes water use e g drip irrigation or using inexpensive methods that use less capital infrastructure but require more water e g flood irrigation similarly crops can be produced using surface water or groundwater depending on relative scarcity production technologies are represented by flexible functional forms that emphasize tradeoffs between inputs specific to a given industry as in standard economic practice inputs are distinguished into primary inputs e g ground water surface water labor capital and intermediate inputs which are outputs produced in the system such as crops that are used as an input in other parts of the system food a case study for the u s state of oregon illustrates the types of insights the model can generate simulations are carried out involving perturbations to surface water availability groundwater availability and the demand for a region s food production sensitivity analysis is conducted regarding the tradability of water rights and values of parameters the west model is able to show which sectors expand and which shrink under different types of shocks and how resources are re deployed for one sector to expand it often pulls resources from other sectors the results align with empirical evidence in debaere and kurzendoefer 2017 suggesting that these general types of shifts have occurred in the past some of the model s predictions could be politically contentious e g because jobs are lost in a certain sector the remainder of the paper is as follows the next section develops a mathematical representation of behavior among economic actors the following section then describes the data requirements for the model and shows how data can be used to parameterize the model an additional section then carries out scenario analysis to highlight how the model highlights connections and outcomes that may not be anticipated or quantified if a model such as that of this paper is used a limitations section highlights key model assumptions and the potential for future research the final section concludes 2 methodology in a market economy decisions about resources may be taken by independent agents such as businesses such agents may exploit profit opportunities and therefore act to maximize the total value of goods and services sold in the economy gilbert and tower 2013 in the optimization model developed below the value of output is maximized in the course of determining an equilibrium of the market economy this is not a statement about whether this is good or bad it is intended to represent the entry and exit and changing sizes of market oriented businesses as responses to changing circumstances the value of output for a region is called gross regional product grp since data on individual businesses are generally not available the basic unit of analysis is a representative agent for each sector that acts in a way that is the sum of individual businesses nicholson and snyder 2012 the decision variables faced by a sector s agent include level of output and selection of inputs the model incorporates a nested production function system as depicted in fig 1 which is similar to burfisher 2011 p 111 this approach distinguishes smaller production processes that are nested within the larger process of producing the final product the bottom right nest of fig 1 is called the primary input nest and for the example contains ground water surface water labor and capital labor is the human effort used in production while capital is a composite category that may include raw materials land buildings machinery equipment and tools the bottom left nest in fig 1 is the intermediate input nest and contains all of the outputs of the economic system these are inputs in this nest because they are used in the production of themselves as well as other goods for example energy is produced as an output but is also an input for itself and all other sectors since intermediary inputs require primary inputs in their production there is a link between the two bottom nests in fig 1 the top nest in fig 1 shows how primary inputs and intermediate inputs are combined to form the final product for example production of crops would require some amount of primary inputs such as water labor and capital and also intermediate inputs such as energy industry services and crops themselves for use as seed to create new crops the user has flexibility as to how energy for example is included in this system the approach depends on the user in the empirical application below energy is left as a composite category it is an output of the system top nest and also an intermediate input bottom left nest because it is used in the production of all goods and services the nests are represented by constant elasticity of substitution functional forms as described in gilbert and tower 2013 there are i 1 i industries alternatively indexed by h and j 1 j primary inputs there is one good or output associated with each industry starting at the bottom right nest of fig 1 the composite of primary inputs used for industry i is defined as 1 v i γ i v j δ j i v f j i ρ i v 1 ρ i v i where ρ i v governs substitutability technological flexibility between primary inputs fji is the demand for input j in industry i γ i v is a productivity parameter and δ j i v is a share term for the relative significance of primary input j in industry i as above the productivity parameter is meant to capture benefits of scale of operation technology and organizational efficiency the latter parameters sum across the j inputs for a given sector i to unity j δ j i v 1 referring to ρ i v as ρ for simplicity ρ indicates how easily one input can be substituted for another when ρ equals one its upper bound then inputs are perfect substitutes that is they may be substituted for one another one for one in the case of crop agriculture for example labor used for weeding could be a perfect substitute for mechanical control of weeds yet as labor becomes scarce or expensive farmers may switch to mechanical techniques on the other extreme as ρ inputs are perfect complements meaning that there is only one fixed way to produce a good or service in practice this is not appropriate for many real world situations there is usually more than one technology available to a business e g a farmer may or may not use supplementary fertilizers below the value of ρ will be taken from estimates made in previous studies it lies within the upper and lower bounds identified above the bottom left nest of fig 1 concerns how intermediate inputs are combined to form what is called an intermediate input composite 2 m i γ i m h δ h i m q h i ρ i m 1 ρ i m i here ρ i m governs substitutability across intermediates within sector i qhi is the quantity of good h used in production of good i γ i m is a productivity parameter and δ h i m is a share term for the relative significance of good h to industry i the latter parameters sum across the h goods for a given sector i to unity m δ h i m 1 finally production of good i at the top of fig 1 be described by the function 3 q i γ i q δ i q v i ρ i q 1 δ i q m i ρ i q 1 ρ i q i where qi is gross or total output of good i γ i q is a productivity parameter δ i q is a share term indicating the relative significance of vi against mi and ρ i q is a parameter governing the overall level of substitutability between the intermediate input and primary input composites the parameter ρ i q concerns how easy it generally is to substitute between intermediate and primary inputs as two groups the above approach has the advantage of allowing for flexibility in how outputs can be produced the degree of flexibility can be tailored to the user s study area by adjusting the elasticity of substitution parameters the amount of inputs purchased within each economic sector is now determined the businesses that comprise an economic sector are assumed to minimize the cost of producing a given level of output to do this they calculate marginal value product nicholson and snyder 2012 gilbert and tower 2013 marginal product is additional output product achieved from a unit increase in an input marginal value product is marginal product multiplied by the price of output p i q i v i v i f j i where pi is the output price of qi with pi being multiplied by the extra amount of qi that arises from employing one more unit of the primary input fji a firm will employ input j until its price wj equals the marginal value product in the appendix it is shown that the above criterion leads to this equation 4 w j p i q i 1 ρ i q v i ρ i q ρ i v γ i q ρ i q γ i v ρ i v δ i q δ i v f j i ρ i v 1 i j eq 4 shows how the demand for primary input vi changes as other aspects of the model change for example if the price of a product rises this will increase the amount of primary input demanded by a sector for intermediate inputs the logic is the same as above and firms optimize when the value of the marginal product equals the price paid for an input industry h s demand for good i can similarly be shown to satisfy the following equation 5 p h p i q i 1 ρ i q m i ρ i q ρ i m γ i q ρ i q γ i m ρ i m 1 δ h i q 1 δ h i m q h i ρ i m 1 h i other key equations for the model include the resource constraint for the primary inputs 6 f j i f j i j this signifies that at a given point in time there are limits on how much input j is available a final equation concerns the calculation of gross regional product grp which is total sales of net output 7 g r p i p i q i m i where qi mi is net output of economic sector i to better understand grp two concepts need to be introduced gross output of product i is the value of it that is produced net output equals gross output of a product piqi less the sum of that product s use as an intermediate input for all sectors pimi grp is equal to net output summed across all sectors gross output and net output are meaningful measures for nexus decisionmakers eqs 1 7 comprise the west model the solution criterion is to maximize grp in order to represent how agents allocate resources in a competitive market economy this criterion and the approach more generally is based upon standard approaches one of the messages of the economics literature is that prices signal scarcity or abundance in a market economy nicholson and snyder 2012 in the case of water however there may not be a market price that acts to meaningfully signal scarcity this implies that the model developed above would need to be modified if one seeks to represent highly regulated water markets the region examined in this study however has water rights that are tradable oregon institute for water and watersheds 2012 water rights holders are allowed to transfer or lease their water right to another person or organization in exchange for money there is an implicit price for water in the manner of traditional economic analysis if the availability of ground or surface water changes then the model would predict the direction and magnitude in the average prices of water 3 case study the west model is illustrated for the hermiston oregon region of the united states according to implan 2016 data that were purchased for this study this region has approximately 90 000 people in 32 000 households the number part and full time jobs is 47 000 and the gross regional product was 3 6 billion u s dollars in 2015 the top industries by value of output include food processing electric power generation and agricultural production because this region is small and its goods and input markets are competitive and well integrated it accords with the model described above regional river systems in this region primarily the columbia and umatilla provide surface water for electricity generation farmland irrigation municipal water fisheries and many other uses ground water resources are also extensive efforts are underway with relevant authorities to increase surface water allotment for this region emerging stresses on the hermiston nexus include falling ground water levels in local aquifers and increased demand for food production in this area the region produces much of north america s french fries this study s authors have been interacting with officials and stakeholders in the hermiston region for several years the cases below represent selected future potential scenarios involving their regional economy two general types of data are required for the west model information on water usage by economic sector is from oregon s water rights information system these data are reported in table 1 and are from a publicly available online database of information pertaining to surface or ground water rights for individual parcels of land except for very minor household use in rural areas all water use is regulated through this system all water belongs to and is managed by the state of oregon individuals organizations and businesses may hold water rights that can be leased or transferred for a profit to different economic agents within a region oregon institute for water and watersheds 2012 the water rights data indicate rates of withdraw and baseline use the measurement used below is the maximum number of acre feet for a permitted purpose each year these measurements are for individual parcels and are aggregated across umatilla and morrow counties which encompass the hermiston oregon region to match with the economic data the major source of economic data is from implan 2016 which was purchased for this study these data concern 536 distinct sectors for example two of the sectors are vegetable and melon farming and greenhouse nursery and floriculture production meanwhile the water rights data break out uses such as frost protection and nursery uses table 1 these two water uses correspond in large part to the two sectors just mentioned the two sectors and two water uses have to do with crops production and so were all aggregated into a larger category called crops altogether seven water rights uses and 13 implan sectors were matched in forming a crops category as another example water rights uses such as municipal uses and human consumption were matched to implan economic sectors to which they would apply including car washes religious organizations and hospitals altogether 17 water rights uses and 137 implan sectors were matched in forming an aggregate category called services below similar types of matching processes were used for the remaining water rights uses and economic data table 2 reports how these aggregations result in six distinct sectors crops animals food energy industry and services the information about surface and groundwater use is listed in row form near the top of the table they are classified as primary inputs along with labor and capital whose use is already reported in the implan data table 2 characterizes the economic and resource aspects of the study area s nexus costs of production distinguish the use of primary and intermediate inputs labor usage is reported in terms of payments to labor which is the sum of all payments made to all employees for the year 2015 system output is distinguished as gross and net output recall that net output is gross output of a sector less the total use of that sector as an input in all sectors as an example of how these calculations are made consider the data on crops in table 2 the total value of crops grown in the study area was 562 0 million in 2015 this required 63 3 million of crops used as seed for example and 180 1 million worth of labor the amount of crops used as intermediate inputs totaled 408 5 million across all six sectors this resulted in a net output for crops of 153 5 million 4 calibration of parameters to study area the model allows for economic agents to adapt their production activities to environmental and economic shocks the cost of this flexibility is that there are parameters to estimate or calibrate yet once data are obtained and put into the form of table 2 it is possible to place numerical values on the parameters through a process called calibration calibration proceeds by algebraically manipulating the equations of the model to make the desired parameter a function of observable data for example the share parameter for the final output nest can be rearranged as δ i q 1 v i ρ i q 1 1 v i ρ i q 1 1 m i ρ i q 1 the value of this parameter can be calculated using information on v summed value of primary inputs and m summed value of intermediate inputs from the last column of table 2 the gams code in the supplementary materials has been programmed to automatically carry out all such calculations gilbert and tower 2013 also needed are elasticities ρ i which are the only parameters not solved for by calibration fortunately there are econometric estimates of the elasticities in chirinko 2008 based on that study all of the elasticity of substitution parameters were set to 1 for the scenario analysis this implies a moderate amount of flexibility regarding how inputs are combined within the system if less is spent to obtain ground water for example more can be spent on capital provision of high efficiency irrigation to make use of the available ground water in other words the model allows for a degree of substitution between capital and ground water as well as other inputs table 3 reports the results of this calibration process for the share and productivity parameters the productivity parameter for output nest range from a low of 1 384 for food to 1 933 for services a higher productivity parameter generally means greater technological or organizational efficiency arising from factors such as economies of scale the higher value for services implies that its expansion could boost gross regional product more readily than that of other sectors there is somewhat more variation in the productivity parameter for primary input nest it ranges from a low of 1 394 for energy to a high of 2 509 for crops there is even more variation in the productivity parameter for the intermediate input nest it ranges from a low of 1 332 for energy to 4 100 for food table 3 also reports the share parameters for the primary and intermediate input nests the share parameters for direct use of ground and surface water are small but are relatively important for crops production while water does not appear to be directly used in food processing this is misleading because food processing requires intermediate inputs like crops that directly use water this interconnectedness implies that any change imposed upon the model must take into account the constellation of share and productivity parameters in the different nests this cannot be solved analytically empirical analysis is necessary to predict the effects of any given shock 5 scenario analysis variation in surface water availability scenario analysis involves changing one or more exogenous variables and then resolving the model to establish a new equilibrium the original and new baseline equilibriums can then be compared the time frame is not strictly specified but may approximate how the change will manifest for the region five years into the future exogenous variables that can be changed include the availability of primary inputs and the demand for output of the economic sectors gams code in the supplemental materials allows readers to replicate the scenarios the first scenario concerns how variations in surface water availability variable f cause changes throughout the nexus in person interviews with stakeholders in the hermiston oregon area reveal a desire to understand how the economy would change if more water can be drawn from local river systems torgerson et al 2006 to illustrate how such a change can be simulated with the west model surface water availability was varied since water rights in the area are tradable water resources can be reallocated across different economic uses in the long term time frame under consideration fig 2 shows how potential changes in future surface water availability affect gross regional product grp change in the size of the overall economy is on the vertical axis and is plotted against changes in water availability there is a small linear increase in grp associated with increased availability of surface water a one percent change in surface water availability to the community is associated with approximately 0 53 million change in grp all else held the same in percentage terms this change is less than 0 1 percent suggesting that without this water the community had sufficient flexibility and adaptive abilities to maintain a high grp fig 3 shows how changes in surface water availability affects the output of individual sectors this is similar to fig 2 except that the six sectors individual contributions to grp are plotted separately on the vertical axis as seen in table 2 each of the production sectors uses different amounts of surface water in addition to other primary and intermediate inputs as more surface water resources are available these tend to be shifted out of industrial activities and towards sectors such as services and crops in the figure the only visible changes in the figure are for industry and services these are visible primarily because of the absolute size of these industries the gross outputs of industry and services are 867 1 and 3658 4 million respectively compared to 562 0 million for crops the implication of these results is that as one resource changes in availability in this case surface water the mix of economic activity in a region will adjust in response to the change in this scenario services and crops grow by 5 7 million 1 0 percent and 155 4 million 3 9 percent respectively for a one percentage point rise in surface water availability to the community as a whole all else held the same surface water as well as the remaining mix of primary and intermediate inputs flows to these sectors because they can most profitably use it they have favorable scales of operation and relatively modest input requirements table 3 fig 4 shows the resultant changes in the number of jobs in different industries the number of workers is on the vertical axis and the change in surface water availability is on the horizontal axis note that the model makes predictions in terms of payments to labor since this is how the implan data are based table 2 the number of jobs in fig 4 is calculated by dividing payments to labor by average wages as reported in the implan data for a one percent change in surface water availability the number of workers in the crops energy industry and service sectors change by as much as 57 1 percent 4 1 percent 1214 32 percent and 1367 4 percent respectively all else held the same for the study area as a whole the rate of employment stays approximately the same however workers in one economic sector may have to move to another sector as they expand and shrink in response to conditions workers who are in a sector which is shrinking and whose skills are not transferable may need to leave the area for work similarly the expansion of other sectors such as the service sector will induce workers from outside the community to move into the region movements of individual workers are not explicitly modeled but this is consistent with the results in fig 4 6 scenario analysis variation in ground water availability the study area has significant groundwater in deep basalt aquifers but there have been groundwater declines of up to 500 feet since the 1950s this aquifer is starting to decline beyond the reach of wells and restrictions have been placed by state authorities against the deepening of existing wells and drilling of new ones torgerson et al 2006 the combination of physical and policy changes will result in future groundwater declines to illustrate how this can be simulated with the west model fig 2 plots grp size of the economy against variation in ground water all else held the same as with surface water the size of the economy changes with the availability of ground water the variation in the size of the economy is not as strong from the change in ground water availability however this is because ground water plays a smaller role in the regional economy table 2 in particular high value industries such as services use little ground water and so the regional economy is fairly resilient to changes fig 5 nonetheless shows that sectoral output is affected by changes in ground water availability the major result of this scenario is that as groundwater declines moving left on the fig 5 axis the output of the crop energy and industry sectors decline as well the services sector actually expands when there is less ground water the reason is that other sectors free up labor and capital for use in the services sector which uses relatively less ground water services need little or no groundwater and are able to generate a great deal of value given the mix of resources that are available table 3 crops are more sensitive to groundwater use than other sectors and so when it declines in availability crop output falls this frees up labor and capital to shift to other sectors like services that can profitably make use of them this type of insight is an important contribution of the west model a corollary is that a decline in ground water availability need not be devastating to the local economy what happens is that economic agents reallocate resources from ground water intensive sectors towards sectors that can profitably expand the policy implication is that the size of the local economy as measured by grp need not decline very much as a critical groundwater designation is imposed as in the study area actions taken to benefit the environment in this case preservation of aquifers need not imply severe economic drawbacks another insight of the west model is that different sectors are affected differently for changes in surface versus ground water in the study area industry is predicted to shrink as surface water availability rises fig 3 but expands as ground water availability rises fig 5 meanwhile services are predicted to expand as surface water availability rises but shrink as ground water availability rises the different responses are driven by sectors peculiar resource needs and inherent productivity within the economy table 3 7 scenario analysis changes in demand for food the hermiston oregon area is a major crop and food producing region a high proportion of u s production of potatoes onions and products processed from such crops e g french fries are produced in this region torgerson et al 2006 as global population grows there will be more pressure put on the agricultural resources of this area on the other hand there could be falling demand for food under economic recessions or dietary change such changes can be represented in the model as changes by varying variable q for the case of food to sharpen the focus on such changes the overall availability of primary inputs is assumed not to change in contrast to the earlier scenarios all inputs however can be redeployed to other sectors based upon which sector has the best chance to earn profits under an exogenous change to the system in the case of water this coincides with water rights being tradable across sectors which is the case for the study area one result to examine is how changes in food demand affect the demand for inputs in all sectors since all sectors are connected through the intermediate input and primary input channels fig 6 depicts how changes in food sales affects the use of surface water use in each different sectors holding all else the same higher sales in the food sector require more surface water whether directly or borne in intermediate inputs along with other primary and intermediate inputs for example new food processing facilities and equipment will have to be purchased and installed which is a capital expense more people will be hired to install operate and maintain the equipment adding to the labor expense for a similar reason the service sector may also expand as the food sector expands there are complementarities between these sectors when the food sector contracts by contrast it can release primary inputs and intermediate inputs to the rest of the regional economy these other sectors can expand due to the newly available resources the precise pattern of changes is an empirical question and fig 6 is one set of results that could occur fig 7 provides a visualization of the flow of primary inputs under a 12 percent rise in food sales the point of this figure is to illustrate one aspect of the nexus namely that primary inputs are pulled from other sectors to enable the food sector to expand 8 sensitivity analysis and external validation one form of sensitivity analysis is to examine how the results change if water rights are not tradable a series of additional experiments were undertaken to examine this alternative the food demand scenario was replicated but with a constraint added to the code that prevents sectors from altering how much water they use compared to the base case scenario the results are extremely sensitive to this assumption if water rights are not tradable in the study area the regional economy would no longer be able to accommodate changing food demands food processing in this region has very little flexibility with regard to water it is not so much the direct use of water by this sector but use of water intensive intermediate inputs like crops changes in food output were zero even if the food demand variable is made to be changed without additional surface or ground water for this sector it cannot expand one interpretation of these results is that tradable water rights help to offset the economic impacts of changing food demand a corollary result is that the ability to trade water across sectors provides a means of compensating and adaptation when there is no change in the overall supply of water to a region another form of sensitivity analysis was carried out regarding ρ these parameters govern flexibility regarding how inputs can be combined in production and are the only parameters not solvable through calibration these were set to 1 for the scenario analysis based on evidence in chirinko 2008 in the primary case of the food demand scenario food gross output rose by 11 2 percent when the elasticities were set to 1 changes in the gross output of other sectors were relatively modest 1 2 percent the same shock was re administered with ρ set to either 2 0 5 or 0 1 the rise in food output rose by 1 1 to 24 2 percent depending on the case suggesting a fair amount of sensitivity the lesson is that the results are sensitive to these parameters so great care should be taken in choosing them the approach of this study has been to rely upon econometric evidence however a researcher could report a range of results that bookend the possible outcomes external validation of the results is possible by comparing the last scenario in which food demand changes to actual events in 2019 in 2019 a major food processor lamb weston added additional potato processing lines that increased capacity to make french fries by roughly 25 percent tri cities business news 2020 under a deal with local authorities the company is also paying for construction of a nearby water reservoir and water main extension the total expansion cost was about 250 million and added about 170 full time jobs to the 390 workers already employed a 43 5 percent rise in jobs in this sector it has not been the point of the scenarios to evaluate this explicit set of events however there is validation in the sense that the model makes very similar qualitative predictions the model could potentially replicate this outcome with an appropriate suite of shocks e g those quite similar to the change in food demand scenario 9 when to use the west model the west model is based on standard economic analysis as described in nicholson and snyder 2012 and gilbert and tower 2013 researchers can use this model for any market economy in which the table 2 data are available these data are used to calibrate the model parameters and provide base values of key variables representing a region s economy as well as its water requirements not only do these data show the total economic output of multiple economic sectors they also show water requirements and the interdependencies between sectors in line with the nexus philosophy the data and model can be extended to indicate the sectors from which a region s residents earn income as well as the degree of openness of the region through imports and exports perhaps the most difficult to obtain part of the data is the water requirements for multiple sectors yet if a researcher is able to obtain such data for the area of interest as done in this study the west model can yield many insights for studies of coupled human and natural systems it is worth comparing the west model to related approaches if a researcher is interested in bilateral international trade patterns and a much more exhaustive characterization of individual countries it would be better to use water oriented general equilibrium models such as gtap w calzadilla et al 2011 haqiqi et al 2016 the west model has some elements of water oriented general equilibrium models such as a nested production system with primary and intermediate inputs unlike the west model the gtap w model is global in scale and does not have water requirements for all of its numerous sectors their models only have water requirements for the agricultural sector like this study debaere and kurzendoefer 2017 consider aggregate sectors including services manufacturing and agriculture that cover all parts of the economy as in the west model they stress the between sector shifts of goods and resources a difference from this study is that they examine historical changes since 1950 and statistically examine why the economy and water use have grown at different rates debaere and kurzendoefer 2017 find evidence that water allocation has historically shift among sectors due to economic sectors which lends support to the approach of this study another study dang et al 2016 is also based on standard economics yet that study differs from all the above in being theoretical in nature and lacking a nested production structure or data the west model can also be compared to other studies that emphasize optimization for example zhang and vesselinov 2017 develop a model to quantify allocations of energy and water that minimize the total costs of supplying energy water food as well as abatement of co2 emissions wicaksono jeong and kang 2019 develop a model to allocate water among competing groups of users in the nexus such that variability in supply for given users is minimized jenkins et al 2004 cast the problem of water allocations in california as an optimization model and calculate the maximum net economic benefit to the state that would come from minimizing the sum of water scarcity costs and operating costs approaches such as these may imply the existence of a central authority that can direct the system the west model fits more with de centralized scales when decisions about resources are taken by independent agents such as businesses the west model can be used for standalone analysis or incorporated into a multi disciplinary design optimization framework to model coupled human and natural systems chans the model could be used in sequential feedback with complex environmental simulation models such as watershed hydrologic models with suitable effort the scenario analysis presented in this paper could be adapted to regions with active interactions between aquifer and stream it is important to acknowledge that the model as formulated above has a number of limitations the model could be made more realistic by introducing a detailed characterization of the study area s hydrology and accounting for recycled water water storage and the role of institutions such as irrigation districts the model could also be extended to account for individual workers or businesses or the movements of goods and resources across regions equity is an increasingly important issue for policy makers and may be an important decision variable for a model such as west at present there is no economic distributional issues that are incorporated into west but they could be if one added households to the economic model these households could derive income from different sectors in this way the model would become more like an applied general equilibrium model ideas for how to approach this are in gilbert and tower 2013 who provide a simplified version of relatively complex general equilibrium models calzadilla et al 2011 haqiqi et at 2016 10 conclusions economic models typically fail to account in a meaningful way for how economic agents rely on and are constrained by the availability of natural resources such as water meanwhile models of the food energy water nexus often lack detail about how economic agents allocate resources in a market economy to bridge this divide this study develops a simulation model called west the model allows for flexible behavior on the part of economic agents and so there are many free parameters to estimate a means of assigning numerical values to model parameters is presented the process is called calibration and generates information regarding the individual technologies of multiple resource using economic sectors the models can also account for whether water rights and water usage can or cannot be transferred across economic sectors the model is applied to a food and energy producing region that makes intensive use of local resources scenario analysis illustrates how the study region could evolve under plausible scenarios involving changes in surface water availability groundwater availability and external food demand the results carry both positive and negative implications for the study area for example the state in the case study oregon allows rights to water to be transferred among users meanwhile the region of focus in oregon is presently receiving authorization to withdraw more water from the nearby columbia river the model predicts that a one percent increase in surface water availability would lead to a 1 05 million increase in the size of the economy less than one percent at the same time the community is likely to have fewer ground water resources available in coming years due to declines in local aquifers this is predicted to have a negative effect on the regional economy but one that is relatively modest compared to the positive changes in surface water availability the pattern by which variations in surface water availability affects the economy also differs from how ground water availability affects the economy should there be an increase in surface water the service sector expands relatively more than other sectors as it is predicted to most profitably make use of the additional water should there be an increase in ground water by contrast the service sector actually declines it declines because other sectors notably industry can more profitably make use of additional ground water as industry grows it draws resources from other sectors some of which shrink most notably services a negative implication implied by the results is that there is movement of jobs across sectors under the scenarios considered this may be stressful for workers and is a social cost of a market economy it might create political resistance to change as might happen if authorities prohibit drilling of new wells for example to protect ground water resources a positive way to view the results is that the community s economy is mostly robust to changes in ground water availability the flexibility engendered through tradable water rights as well as flexible production technology allows for adjustments that can preserve the size of the economy as a result actions taken to benefit the environment such as protection of aquifers need not imply long term economic drawbacks so long as workers are willing to be deployed in new sectors despite its simple nature the west model is able to shed light on a number of relationships and constraints that have been little explored in the literature model code and a template for data requirements are provided so that readers can apply the west model to other regions while economic data needs are parsimonious the model needs to be paired with detailed water use data to conduct the type of analysis in this study the model could also be combined with a separate hydrologic model as part of a multi disciplinary design optimization framework an analysis that does not use an approach like the west model may understate the ability of local economies to absorb adverse shocks such as water shortages the model can illustrate that diversity in a regional economy is a form of resilience when one part of the economy is shrinking there are often other parts that expand to absorb resources such as labor and water rights this can be positive news for decisionmakers who are worried that policies to sustain the environment may harm the local economy credit authorship contribution statement jeffrey j reimer conceptualization methodology investigation software writing original draft meghna babbar sebens

464,regions with vulnerabilities in their food energy water nexus may also have economic vulnerabilities actions to reduce environmental vulnerabilities may conflict with community concerns about jobs and economic vitality to account for these potentially competing concerns this study builds a nexus simulation model that incorporates water energy food and detailed economic data the model can be used for standalone analysis or incorporated into a multi disciplinary design optimization framework the model is called west for water economy simulation tool and can show how jobs and economic growth interact with surface and groundwater use food and energy a case study for the u s state of oregon illustrates the insights to be gained from the approach and provides a template for readers to develop their own west simulation model keywords coupled human and natural systems chans economics food energy water few water resources tradeoffs 1 introduction the food energy water nexus henceforth nexus concerns the synergies and trade offs between food energy and water security that are not captured if these sectors are analyzed in isolation a number of models have been built which capture certain aspects of the nexus and enable evaluation of interrelated challenges e g daher and mohtar 2015 covarrubias 2019 martinez hernandez et al 2017 cai et al 2018 wicaksono et al 2019 traditional economic models typically fail to account in a meaningful way for how economic agents rely on and are constrained by the availability of natural resources such as water non economic models of the nexus often abstract from economic agents that influence and are influenced by the system to bridge this divide this study develops a simulation model called west for water economy simulation tool below it will be shown that with a parsimonious amount of data for a region or nation the west model can be parameterized and used to simulate possible future nexus scenarios this effort is one response to recent critical reviews which suggest that nexus models increasingly need to incorporate aspects beyond water energy and food such as explicit economic and policy considerations biggs et al 2015 dang et al 2016 konar et al 2016 al saidi and elagib 2017 weitz et al 2017 suggest that the standard nexus concept may be disconnected from the decision making and policy making processes it ultimately seeks to influence there is a need for a model that captures stakeholder decision making variables such as output choices for different industries and the associated processes to food energy water nexus models policy making processes in many regions often include economic considerations that directly impact individuals decisionmakers may be politicians whose constituents are voters that are concerned about economic outcomes communities and regions are in some sense organized around jobs without employment people may move to another community where they can find work reimer 2012 reimer 2014 dao et al 2014 the west model s focus on jobs is just one factor that west incorporates that other models do not the model also accounts for a production flexibility in which different combinations of inputs can be used to produce a good or service business decisions regarding what and how much to produce are based on prices received and the cost of production the businesses that comprise a sector are often engaged in competition with other businesses market economies are common throughout the world and give rise to their own forms of instability chaloff et al 2012 this study develops a simulation model of the nexus for a market economy that incorporates a number of human and economic dimensions missing in other models the west model demonstrates how the food energy and water nexus fits within the broader economy the model can be used to represent regions of various sizes throughout the world it mainly needs a single table of economic and water resource data described below the west model employs numerical optimization methods and is appropriate for market economies in which decisions about water energy and food are largely de centralized the model is static starting with an observed nexus outcome and then predicts what happens when an environmental or economic perturbation or shock occurs the model makes predictions about what happens under future scenarios such as declines in groundwater availability and increased demand for food the model can help researchers capture the conflicting interests faced by community decision makers such as tradeoffs between economic growth and resource conservation the west model can represent systems where there is more than one way to produce a good for example a crop could be produced using capital intensive irrigation equipment that minimizes water use e g drip irrigation or using inexpensive methods that use less capital infrastructure but require more water e g flood irrigation similarly crops can be produced using surface water or groundwater depending on relative scarcity production technologies are represented by flexible functional forms that emphasize tradeoffs between inputs specific to a given industry as in standard economic practice inputs are distinguished into primary inputs e g ground water surface water labor capital and intermediate inputs which are outputs produced in the system such as crops that are used as an input in other parts of the system food a case study for the u s state of oregon illustrates the types of insights the model can generate simulations are carried out involving perturbations to surface water availability groundwater availability and the demand for a region s food production sensitivity analysis is conducted regarding the tradability of water rights and values of parameters the west model is able to show which sectors expand and which shrink under different types of shocks and how resources are re deployed for one sector to expand it often pulls resources from other sectors the results align with empirical evidence in debaere and kurzendoefer 2017 suggesting that these general types of shifts have occurred in the past some of the model s predictions could be politically contentious e g because jobs are lost in a certain sector the remainder of the paper is as follows the next section develops a mathematical representation of behavior among economic actors the following section then describes the data requirements for the model and shows how data can be used to parameterize the model an additional section then carries out scenario analysis to highlight how the model highlights connections and outcomes that may not be anticipated or quantified if a model such as that of this paper is used a limitations section highlights key model assumptions and the potential for future research the final section concludes 2 methodology in a market economy decisions about resources may be taken by independent agents such as businesses such agents may exploit profit opportunities and therefore act to maximize the total value of goods and services sold in the economy gilbert and tower 2013 in the optimization model developed below the value of output is maximized in the course of determining an equilibrium of the market economy this is not a statement about whether this is good or bad it is intended to represent the entry and exit and changing sizes of market oriented businesses as responses to changing circumstances the value of output for a region is called gross regional product grp since data on individual businesses are generally not available the basic unit of analysis is a representative agent for each sector that acts in a way that is the sum of individual businesses nicholson and snyder 2012 the decision variables faced by a sector s agent include level of output and selection of inputs the model incorporates a nested production function system as depicted in fig 1 which is similar to burfisher 2011 p 111 this approach distinguishes smaller production processes that are nested within the larger process of producing the final product the bottom right nest of fig 1 is called the primary input nest and for the example contains ground water surface water labor and capital labor is the human effort used in production while capital is a composite category that may include raw materials land buildings machinery equipment and tools the bottom left nest in fig 1 is the intermediate input nest and contains all of the outputs of the economic system these are inputs in this nest because they are used in the production of themselves as well as other goods for example energy is produced as an output but is also an input for itself and all other sectors since intermediary inputs require primary inputs in their production there is a link between the two bottom nests in fig 1 the top nest in fig 1 shows how primary inputs and intermediate inputs are combined to form the final product for example production of crops would require some amount of primary inputs such as water labor and capital and also intermediate inputs such as energy industry services and crops themselves for use as seed to create new crops the user has flexibility as to how energy for example is included in this system the approach depends on the user in the empirical application below energy is left as a composite category it is an output of the system top nest and also an intermediate input bottom left nest because it is used in the production of all goods and services the nests are represented by constant elasticity of substitution functional forms as described in gilbert and tower 2013 there are i 1 i industries alternatively indexed by h and j 1 j primary inputs there is one good or output associated with each industry starting at the bottom right nest of fig 1 the composite of primary inputs used for industry i is defined as 1 v i γ i v j δ j i v f j i ρ i v 1 ρ i v i where ρ i v governs substitutability technological flexibility between primary inputs fji is the demand for input j in industry i γ i v is a productivity parameter and δ j i v is a share term for the relative significance of primary input j in industry i as above the productivity parameter is meant to capture benefits of scale of operation technology and organizational efficiency the latter parameters sum across the j inputs for a given sector i to unity j δ j i v 1 referring to ρ i v as ρ for simplicity ρ indicates how easily one input can be substituted for another when ρ equals one its upper bound then inputs are perfect substitutes that is they may be substituted for one another one for one in the case of crop agriculture for example labor used for weeding could be a perfect substitute for mechanical control of weeds yet as labor becomes scarce or expensive farmers may switch to mechanical techniques on the other extreme as ρ inputs are perfect complements meaning that there is only one fixed way to produce a good or service in practice this is not appropriate for many real world situations there is usually more than one technology available to a business e g a farmer may or may not use supplementary fertilizers below the value of ρ will be taken from estimates made in previous studies it lies within the upper and lower bounds identified above the bottom left nest of fig 1 concerns how intermediate inputs are combined to form what is called an intermediate input composite 2 m i γ i m h δ h i m q h i ρ i m 1 ρ i m i here ρ i m governs substitutability across intermediates within sector i qhi is the quantity of good h used in production of good i γ i m is a productivity parameter and δ h i m is a share term for the relative significance of good h to industry i the latter parameters sum across the h goods for a given sector i to unity m δ h i m 1 finally production of good i at the top of fig 1 be described by the function 3 q i γ i q δ i q v i ρ i q 1 δ i q m i ρ i q 1 ρ i q i where qi is gross or total output of good i γ i q is a productivity parameter δ i q is a share term indicating the relative significance of vi against mi and ρ i q is a parameter governing the overall level of substitutability between the intermediate input and primary input composites the parameter ρ i q concerns how easy it generally is to substitute between intermediate and primary inputs as two groups the above approach has the advantage of allowing for flexibility in how outputs can be produced the degree of flexibility can be tailored to the user s study area by adjusting the elasticity of substitution parameters the amount of inputs purchased within each economic sector is now determined the businesses that comprise an economic sector are assumed to minimize the cost of producing a given level of output to do this they calculate marginal value product nicholson and snyder 2012 gilbert and tower 2013 marginal product is additional output product achieved from a unit increase in an input marginal value product is marginal product multiplied by the price of output p i q i v i v i f j i where pi is the output price of qi with pi being multiplied by the extra amount of qi that arises from employing one more unit of the primary input fji a firm will employ input j until its price wj equals the marginal value product in the appendix it is shown that the above criterion leads to this equation 4 w j p i q i 1 ρ i q v i ρ i q ρ i v γ i q ρ i q γ i v ρ i v δ i q δ i v f j i ρ i v 1 i j eq 4 shows how the demand for primary input vi changes as other aspects of the model change for example if the price of a product rises this will increase the amount of primary input demanded by a sector for intermediate inputs the logic is the same as above and firms optimize when the value of the marginal product equals the price paid for an input industry h s demand for good i can similarly be shown to satisfy the following equation 5 p h p i q i 1 ρ i q m i ρ i q ρ i m γ i q ρ i q γ i m ρ i m 1 δ h i q 1 δ h i m q h i ρ i m 1 h i other key equations for the model include the resource constraint for the primary inputs 6 f j i f j i j this signifies that at a given point in time there are limits on how much input j is available a final equation concerns the calculation of gross regional product grp which is total sales of net output 7 g r p i p i q i m i where qi mi is net output of economic sector i to better understand grp two concepts need to be introduced gross output of product i is the value of it that is produced net output equals gross output of a product piqi less the sum of that product s use as an intermediate input for all sectors pimi grp is equal to net output summed across all sectors gross output and net output are meaningful measures for nexus decisionmakers eqs 1 7 comprise the west model the solution criterion is to maximize grp in order to represent how agents allocate resources in a competitive market economy this criterion and the approach more generally is based upon standard approaches one of the messages of the economics literature is that prices signal scarcity or abundance in a market economy nicholson and snyder 2012 in the case of water however there may not be a market price that acts to meaningfully signal scarcity this implies that the model developed above would need to be modified if one seeks to represent highly regulated water markets the region examined in this study however has water rights that are tradable oregon institute for water and watersheds 2012 water rights holders are allowed to transfer or lease their water right to another person or organization in exchange for money there is an implicit price for water in the manner of traditional economic analysis if the availability of ground or surface water changes then the model would predict the direction and magnitude in the average prices of water 3 case study the west model is illustrated for the hermiston oregon region of the united states according to implan 2016 data that were purchased for this study this region has approximately 90 000 people in 32 000 households the number part and full time jobs is 47 000 and the gross regional product was 3 6 billion u s dollars in 2015 the top industries by value of output include food processing electric power generation and agricultural production because this region is small and its goods and input markets are competitive and well integrated it accords with the model described above regional river systems in this region primarily the columbia and umatilla provide surface water for electricity generation farmland irrigation municipal water fisheries and many other uses ground water resources are also extensive efforts are underway with relevant authorities to increase surface water allotment for this region emerging stresses on the hermiston nexus include falling ground water levels in local aquifers and increased demand for food production in this area the region produces much of north america s french fries this study s authors have been interacting with officials and stakeholders in the hermiston region for several years the cases below represent selected future potential scenarios involving their regional economy two general types of data are required for the west model information on water usage by economic sector is from oregon s water rights information system these data are reported in table 1 and are from a publicly available online database of information pertaining to surface or ground water rights for individual parcels of land except for very minor household use in rural areas all water use is regulated through this system all water belongs to and is managed by the state of oregon individuals organizations and businesses may hold water rights that can be leased or transferred for a profit to different economic agents within a region oregon institute for water and watersheds 2012 the water rights data indicate rates of withdraw and baseline use the measurement used below is the maximum number of acre feet for a permitted purpose each year these measurements are for individual parcels and are aggregated across umatilla and morrow counties which encompass the hermiston oregon region to match with the economic data the major source of economic data is from implan 2016 which was purchased for this study these data concern 536 distinct sectors for example two of the sectors are vegetable and melon farming and greenhouse nursery and floriculture production meanwhile the water rights data break out uses such as frost protection and nursery uses table 1 these two water uses correspond in large part to the two sectors just mentioned the two sectors and two water uses have to do with crops production and so were all aggregated into a larger category called crops altogether seven water rights uses and 13 implan sectors were matched in forming a crops category as another example water rights uses such as municipal uses and human consumption were matched to implan economic sectors to which they would apply including car washes religious organizations and hospitals altogether 17 water rights uses and 137 implan sectors were matched in forming an aggregate category called services below similar types of matching processes were used for the remaining water rights uses and economic data table 2 reports how these aggregations result in six distinct sectors crops animals food energy industry and services the information about surface and groundwater use is listed in row form near the top of the table they are classified as primary inputs along with labor and capital whose use is already reported in the implan data table 2 characterizes the economic and resource aspects of the study area s nexus costs of production distinguish the use of primary and intermediate inputs labor usage is reported in terms of payments to labor which is the sum of all payments made to all employees for the year 2015 system output is distinguished as gross and net output recall that net output is gross output of a sector less the total use of that sector as an input in all sectors as an example of how these calculations are made consider the data on crops in table 2 the total value of crops grown in the study area was 562 0 million in 2015 this required 63 3 million of crops used as seed for example and 180 1 million worth of labor the amount of crops used as intermediate inputs totaled 408 5 million across all six sectors this resulted in a net output for crops of 153 5 million 4 calibration of parameters to study area the model allows for economic agents to adapt their production activities to environmental and economic shocks the cost of this flexibility is that there are parameters to estimate or calibrate yet once data are obtained and put into the form of table 2 it is possible to place numerical values on the parameters through a process called calibration calibration proceeds by algebraically manipulating the equations of the model to make the desired parameter a function of observable data for example the share parameter for the final output nest can be rearranged as δ i q 1 v i ρ i q 1 1 v i ρ i q 1 1 m i ρ i q 1 the value of this parameter can be calculated using information on v summed value of primary inputs and m summed value of intermediate inputs from the last column of table 2 the gams code in the supplementary materials has been programmed to automatically carry out all such calculations gilbert and tower 2013 also needed are elasticities ρ i which are the only parameters not solved for by calibration fortunately there are econometric estimates of the elasticities in chirinko 2008 based on that study all of the elasticity of substitution parameters were set to 1 for the scenario analysis this implies a moderate amount of flexibility regarding how inputs are combined within the system if less is spent to obtain ground water for example more can be spent on capital provision of high efficiency irrigation to make use of the available ground water in other words the model allows for a degree of substitution between capital and ground water as well as other inputs table 3 reports the results of this calibration process for the share and productivity parameters the productivity parameter for output nest range from a low of 1 384 for food to 1 933 for services a higher productivity parameter generally means greater technological or organizational efficiency arising from factors such as economies of scale the higher value for services implies that its expansion could boost gross regional product more readily than that of other sectors there is somewhat more variation in the productivity parameter for primary input nest it ranges from a low of 1 394 for energy to a high of 2 509 for crops there is even more variation in the productivity parameter for the intermediate input nest it ranges from a low of 1 332 for energy to 4 100 for food table 3 also reports the share parameters for the primary and intermediate input nests the share parameters for direct use of ground and surface water are small but are relatively important for crops production while water does not appear to be directly used in food processing this is misleading because food processing requires intermediate inputs like crops that directly use water this interconnectedness implies that any change imposed upon the model must take into account the constellation of share and productivity parameters in the different nests this cannot be solved analytically empirical analysis is necessary to predict the effects of any given shock 5 scenario analysis variation in surface water availability scenario analysis involves changing one or more exogenous variables and then resolving the model to establish a new equilibrium the original and new baseline equilibriums can then be compared the time frame is not strictly specified but may approximate how the change will manifest for the region five years into the future exogenous variables that can be changed include the availability of primary inputs and the demand for output of the economic sectors gams code in the supplemental materials allows readers to replicate the scenarios the first scenario concerns how variations in surface water availability variable f cause changes throughout the nexus in person interviews with stakeholders in the hermiston oregon area reveal a desire to understand how the economy would change if more water can be drawn from local river systems torgerson et al 2006 to illustrate how such a change can be simulated with the west model surface water availability was varied since water rights in the area are tradable water resources can be reallocated across different economic uses in the long term time frame under consideration fig 2 shows how potential changes in future surface water availability affect gross regional product grp change in the size of the overall economy is on the vertical axis and is plotted against changes in water availability there is a small linear increase in grp associated with increased availability of surface water a one percent change in surface water availability to the community is associated with approximately 0 53 million change in grp all else held the same in percentage terms this change is less than 0 1 percent suggesting that without this water the community had sufficient flexibility and adaptive abilities to maintain a high grp fig 3 shows how changes in surface water availability affects the output of individual sectors this is similar to fig 2 except that the six sectors individual contributions to grp are plotted separately on the vertical axis as seen in table 2 each of the production sectors uses different amounts of surface water in addition to other primary and intermediate inputs as more surface water resources are available these tend to be shifted out of industrial activities and towards sectors such as services and crops in the figure the only visible changes in the figure are for industry and services these are visible primarily because of the absolute size of these industries the gross outputs of industry and services are 867 1 and 3658 4 million respectively compared to 562 0 million for crops the implication of these results is that as one resource changes in availability in this case surface water the mix of economic activity in a region will adjust in response to the change in this scenario services and crops grow by 5 7 million 1 0 percent and 155 4 million 3 9 percent respectively for a one percentage point rise in surface water availability to the community as a whole all else held the same surface water as well as the remaining mix of primary and intermediate inputs flows to these sectors because they can most profitably use it they have favorable scales of operation and relatively modest input requirements table 3 fig 4 shows the resultant changes in the number of jobs in different industries the number of workers is on the vertical axis and the change in surface water availability is on the horizontal axis note that the model makes predictions in terms of payments to labor since this is how the implan data are based table 2 the number of jobs in fig 4 is calculated by dividing payments to labor by average wages as reported in the implan data for a one percent change in surface water availability the number of workers in the crops energy industry and service sectors change by as much as 57 1 percent 4 1 percent 1214 32 percent and 1367 4 percent respectively all else held the same for the study area as a whole the rate of employment stays approximately the same however workers in one economic sector may have to move to another sector as they expand and shrink in response to conditions workers who are in a sector which is shrinking and whose skills are not transferable may need to leave the area for work similarly the expansion of other sectors such as the service sector will induce workers from outside the community to move into the region movements of individual workers are not explicitly modeled but this is consistent with the results in fig 4 6 scenario analysis variation in ground water availability the study area has significant groundwater in deep basalt aquifers but there have been groundwater declines of up to 500 feet since the 1950s this aquifer is starting to decline beyond the reach of wells and restrictions have been placed by state authorities against the deepening of existing wells and drilling of new ones torgerson et al 2006 the combination of physical and policy changes will result in future groundwater declines to illustrate how this can be simulated with the west model fig 2 plots grp size of the economy against variation in ground water all else held the same as with surface water the size of the economy changes with the availability of ground water the variation in the size of the economy is not as strong from the change in ground water availability however this is because ground water plays a smaller role in the regional economy table 2 in particular high value industries such as services use little ground water and so the regional economy is fairly resilient to changes fig 5 nonetheless shows that sectoral output is affected by changes in ground water availability the major result of this scenario is that as groundwater declines moving left on the fig 5 axis the output of the crop energy and industry sectors decline as well the services sector actually expands when there is less ground water the reason is that other sectors free up labor and capital for use in the services sector which uses relatively less ground water services need little or no groundwater and are able to generate a great deal of value given the mix of resources that are available table 3 crops are more sensitive to groundwater use than other sectors and so when it declines in availability crop output falls this frees up labor and capital to shift to other sectors like services that can profitably make use of them this type of insight is an important contribution of the west model a corollary is that a decline in ground water availability need not be devastating to the local economy what happens is that economic agents reallocate resources from ground water intensive sectors towards sectors that can profitably expand the policy implication is that the size of the local economy as measured by grp need not decline very much as a critical groundwater designation is imposed as in the study area actions taken to benefit the environment in this case preservation of aquifers need not imply severe economic drawbacks another insight of the west model is that different sectors are affected differently for changes in surface versus ground water in the study area industry is predicted to shrink as surface water availability rises fig 3 but expands as ground water availability rises fig 5 meanwhile services are predicted to expand as surface water availability rises but shrink as ground water availability rises the different responses are driven by sectors peculiar resource needs and inherent productivity within the economy table 3 7 scenario analysis changes in demand for food the hermiston oregon area is a major crop and food producing region a high proportion of u s production of potatoes onions and products processed from such crops e g french fries are produced in this region torgerson et al 2006 as global population grows there will be more pressure put on the agricultural resources of this area on the other hand there could be falling demand for food under economic recessions or dietary change such changes can be represented in the model as changes by varying variable q for the case of food to sharpen the focus on such changes the overall availability of primary inputs is assumed not to change in contrast to the earlier scenarios all inputs however can be redeployed to other sectors based upon which sector has the best chance to earn profits under an exogenous change to the system in the case of water this coincides with water rights being tradable across sectors which is the case for the study area one result to examine is how changes in food demand affect the demand for inputs in all sectors since all sectors are connected through the intermediate input and primary input channels fig 6 depicts how changes in food sales affects the use of surface water use in each different sectors holding all else the same higher sales in the food sector require more surface water whether directly or borne in intermediate inputs along with other primary and intermediate inputs for example new food processing facilities and equipment will have to be purchased and installed which is a capital expense more people will be hired to install operate and maintain the equipment adding to the labor expense for a similar reason the service sector may also expand as the food sector expands there are complementarities between these sectors when the food sector contracts by contrast it can release primary inputs and intermediate inputs to the rest of the regional economy these other sectors can expand due to the newly available resources the precise pattern of changes is an empirical question and fig 6 is one set of results that could occur fig 7 provides a visualization of the flow of primary inputs under a 12 percent rise in food sales the point of this figure is to illustrate one aspect of the nexus namely that primary inputs are pulled from other sectors to enable the food sector to expand 8 sensitivity analysis and external validation one form of sensitivity analysis is to examine how the results change if water rights are not tradable a series of additional experiments were undertaken to examine this alternative the food demand scenario was replicated but with a constraint added to the code that prevents sectors from altering how much water they use compared to the base case scenario the results are extremely sensitive to this assumption if water rights are not tradable in the study area the regional economy would no longer be able to accommodate changing food demands food processing in this region has very little flexibility with regard to water it is not so much the direct use of water by this sector but use of water intensive intermediate inputs like crops changes in food output were zero even if the food demand variable is made to be changed without additional surface or ground water for this sector it cannot expand one interpretation of these results is that tradable water rights help to offset the economic impacts of changing food demand a corollary result is that the ability to trade water across sectors provides a means of compensating and adaptation when there is no change in the overall supply of water to a region another form of sensitivity analysis was carried out regarding ρ these parameters govern flexibility regarding how inputs can be combined in production and are the only parameters not solvable through calibration these were set to 1 for the scenario analysis based on evidence in chirinko 2008 in the primary case of the food demand scenario food gross output rose by 11 2 percent when the elasticities were set to 1 changes in the gross output of other sectors were relatively modest 1 2 percent the same shock was re administered with ρ set to either 2 0 5 or 0 1 the rise in food output rose by 1 1 to 24 2 percent depending on the case suggesting a fair amount of sensitivity the lesson is that the results are sensitive to these parameters so great care should be taken in choosing them the approach of this study has been to rely upon econometric evidence however a researcher could report a range of results that bookend the possible outcomes external validation of the results is possible by comparing the last scenario in which food demand changes to actual events in 2019 in 2019 a major food processor lamb weston added additional potato processing lines that increased capacity to make french fries by roughly 25 percent tri cities business news 2020 under a deal with local authorities the company is also paying for construction of a nearby water reservoir and water main extension the total expansion cost was about 250 million and added about 170 full time jobs to the 390 workers already employed a 43 5 percent rise in jobs in this sector it has not been the point of the scenarios to evaluate this explicit set of events however there is validation in the sense that the model makes very similar qualitative predictions the model could potentially replicate this outcome with an appropriate suite of shocks e g those quite similar to the change in food demand scenario 9 when to use the west model the west model is based on standard economic analysis as described in nicholson and snyder 2012 and gilbert and tower 2013 researchers can use this model for any market economy in which the table 2 data are available these data are used to calibrate the model parameters and provide base values of key variables representing a region s economy as well as its water requirements not only do these data show the total economic output of multiple economic sectors they also show water requirements and the interdependencies between sectors in line with the nexus philosophy the data and model can be extended to indicate the sectors from which a region s residents earn income as well as the degree of openness of the region through imports and exports perhaps the most difficult to obtain part of the data is the water requirements for multiple sectors yet if a researcher is able to obtain such data for the area of interest as done in this study the west model can yield many insights for studies of coupled human and natural systems it is worth comparing the west model to related approaches if a researcher is interested in bilateral international trade patterns and a much more exhaustive characterization of individual countries it would be better to use water oriented general equilibrium models such as gtap w calzadilla et al 2011 haqiqi et al 2016 the west model has some elements of water oriented general equilibrium models such as a nested production system with primary and intermediate inputs unlike the west model the gtap w model is global in scale and does not have water requirements for all of its numerous sectors their models only have water requirements for the agricultural sector like this study debaere and kurzendoefer 2017 consider aggregate sectors including services manufacturing and agriculture that cover all parts of the economy as in the west model they stress the between sector shifts of goods and resources a difference from this study is that they examine historical changes since 1950 and statistically examine why the economy and water use have grown at different rates debaere and kurzendoefer 2017 find evidence that water allocation has historically shift among sectors due to economic sectors which lends support to the approach of this study another study dang et al 2016 is also based on standard economics yet that study differs from all the above in being theoretical in nature and lacking a nested production structure or data the west model can also be compared to other studies that emphasize optimization for example zhang and vesselinov 2017 develop a model to quantify allocations of energy and water that minimize the total costs of supplying energy water food as well as abatement of co2 emissions wicaksono jeong and kang 2019 develop a model to allocate water among competing groups of users in the nexus such that variability in supply for given users is minimized jenkins et al 2004 cast the problem of water allocations in california as an optimization model and calculate the maximum net economic benefit to the state that would come from minimizing the sum of water scarcity costs and operating costs approaches such as these may imply the existence of a central authority that can direct the system the west model fits more with de centralized scales when decisions about resources are taken by independent agents such as businesses the west model can be used for standalone analysis or incorporated into a multi disciplinary design optimization framework to model coupled human and natural systems chans the model could be used in sequential feedback with complex environmental simulation models such as watershed hydrologic models with suitable effort the scenario analysis presented in this paper could be adapted to regions with active interactions between aquifer and stream it is important to acknowledge that the model as formulated above has a number of limitations the model could be made more realistic by introducing a detailed characterization of the study area s hydrology and accounting for recycled water water storage and the role of institutions such as irrigation districts the model could also be extended to account for individual workers or businesses or the movements of goods and resources across regions equity is an increasingly important issue for policy makers and may be an important decision variable for a model such as west at present there is no economic distributional issues that are incorporated into west but they could be if one added households to the economic model these households could derive income from different sectors in this way the model would become more like an applied general equilibrium model ideas for how to approach this are in gilbert and tower 2013 who provide a simplified version of relatively complex general equilibrium models calzadilla et al 2011 haqiqi et at 2016 10 conclusions economic models typically fail to account in a meaningful way for how economic agents rely on and are constrained by the availability of natural resources such as water meanwhile models of the food energy water nexus often lack detail about how economic agents allocate resources in a market economy to bridge this divide this study develops a simulation model called west the model allows for flexible behavior on the part of economic agents and so there are many free parameters to estimate a means of assigning numerical values to model parameters is presented the process is called calibration and generates information regarding the individual technologies of multiple resource using economic sectors the models can also account for whether water rights and water usage can or cannot be transferred across economic sectors the model is applied to a food and energy producing region that makes intensive use of local resources scenario analysis illustrates how the study region could evolve under plausible scenarios involving changes in surface water availability groundwater availability and external food demand the results carry both positive and negative implications for the study area for example the state in the case study oregon allows rights to water to be transferred among users meanwhile the region of focus in oregon is presently receiving authorization to withdraw more water from the nearby columbia river the model predicts that a one percent increase in surface water availability would lead to a 1 05 million increase in the size of the economy less than one percent at the same time the community is likely to have fewer ground water resources available in coming years due to declines in local aquifers this is predicted to have a negative effect on the regional economy but one that is relatively modest compared to the positive changes in surface water availability the pattern by which variations in surface water availability affects the economy also differs from how ground water availability affects the economy should there be an increase in surface water the service sector expands relatively more than other sectors as it is predicted to most profitably make use of the additional water should there be an increase in ground water by contrast the service sector actually declines it declines because other sectors notably industry can more profitably make use of additional ground water as industry grows it draws resources from other sectors some of which shrink most notably services a negative implication implied by the results is that there is movement of jobs across sectors under the scenarios considered this may be stressful for workers and is a social cost of a market economy it might create political resistance to change as might happen if authorities prohibit drilling of new wells for example to protect ground water resources a positive way to view the results is that the community s economy is mostly robust to changes in ground water availability the flexibility engendered through tradable water rights as well as flexible production technology allows for adjustments that can preserve the size of the economy as a result actions taken to benefit the environment such as protection of aquifers need not imply long term economic drawbacks so long as workers are willing to be deployed in new sectors despite its simple nature the west model is able to shed light on a number of relationships and constraints that have been little explored in the literature model code and a template for data requirements are provided so that readers can apply the west model to other regions while economic data needs are parsimonious the model needs to be paired with detailed water use data to conduct the type of analysis in this study the model could also be combined with a separate hydrologic model as part of a multi disciplinary design optimization framework an analysis that does not use an approach like the west model may understate the ability of local economies to absorb adverse shocks such as water shortages the model can illustrate that diversity in a regional economy is a form of resilience when one part of the economy is shrinking there are often other parts that expand to absorb resources such as labor and water rights this can be positive news for decisionmakers who are worried that policies to sustain the environment may harm the local economy credit authorship contribution statement jeffrey j reimer conceptualization methodology investigation software writing original draft meghna babbar sebens
